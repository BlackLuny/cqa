ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|xnBnbYBgaa	sit ups and crunches. lie on your back and hold an excercise ball between your knees. do 20 and then do a frozen crunch for 30 seconds. i did this to get in shape for prom and i lost 4 inches in 2 weeks but it is rigorous and youll be hurting for a bit.|`|ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	sit ups  run or jog  walking is good too|`|XUrgcOMDaa	a really good one (and it feels easy when you're doing it) is to lay on the floor, put your feet up in the air (so your body is making an "L" shape) and then lift your pelvis up and down in a steady motion, while breathing.  do as many as you can... and you'll be able to do a lot... and your abs will definitely feel it later.    and that one works all of the ab muscles.

93d1272e676f48f0eee8d8378c0b91f2aa	any exercise is good, it will help you burn calories. as far as eating you do not have to be a great cook, salads are great, grilled chicken, cook until juices run clear and meat is not pink anymore. if you eat lean meats and veggies and stay away from carbs this will help you lose. drink water, i know it doesn't sound good but it does help you flush your system and i have done this and it will help you burn more calories, the colder the better as you body will 'heat' up and burn more calories trying to get you to normal body temp.try and eat five or six small meals a day instead of three bigger meals this helps you body continue to burn all day instead of having times that you body is hungry waiting for the next meal.this works, as your body is always burning calories. as far as when you will see a difference in your body, that is really hard to say as everyone loses at different rates, but if you keep it up within a month things should start to be noticed!  and i always try and eat my last meal by 6pm and then just drink water after that, I'm still fighting the good fight but have lost 17lbs since Christmas. you have to stick with it and watch what you eat. i do not use an elliptical but walk quickly at the gym and when nice enough outside. I hope this has helped you, keep it up and good luck! :)|`|SiniSj1eaa	I love the elliptical machine. I started using it a month ago. I always tried to run in the past and would die after like 10 minutes. With the elliptical I can go for 30-40 minutes now which makes me want to continue working out. Ive notice a couple lbs have gone, but I wasnt really looking to lose weight. I was just wanting to get into the habit of excersising so I really havent changed my diet.     I never eat after 7pm. Ever.     Get a george forman grill and a bunch of chicken breasts! I love chicken breast and you can season it different ways or eat it in a salad! Good luck!!    ps. Steak really isnt as bad for you as you may think. As long as its a lean cut. So you could always treat yourself with that :)    Also as long as your heart rate is up. Excersising twice for 20 minutes can be just as good as the 40. Ive read a lot about that.|`|V3kzue7Zaa	Drastically cut back your carbs and sugar.  Such as cereal, white bread, pasta, soda.    Less fat just means more carbs in order to make it tasty.  Hence, still making a person over-weight.      My Dad has done this for 5+ years now, and only works out some and does yard work.  He's lost lots of weight.      Depending on the type of exercising you are doing, 40 mins may be better than 2 - 20 mins.   It takes your body a while to warm up and start burning off stuff.   Plus, you may not be disciplined enough to do the 2nd 20 min workout.|`|gqvvXknQaa	That's good you are going in a healthy step to loose weight!    With the elliptical cross trainer, try to up your minutes every time you workout. Such as, one day, set a goal for 22 minutes, then maybe the next day go for 24 mins. Keep going until you can do at least 45-60mins.    As far as eating a low calorie meal, just start eating healthy in small portions. Think non-processes food. Grilled chicken, salads, fruit and PLENTY of water. Stay away from junk food and alcohol. If you really want to watch what you take in, read the label.    Also, there is no right or wrong time to eat. You should eat your last meal latest about an hour before you go to bed. No matter what time you eat last, it will all get digested the same way.
wQEdey24aa	Yeah of course you can buy designer glasses, even if you are under 16. You can choose any frame you like...mens or womens and I think they have a kids section too, though im not sure whether you'll be interested in that - dont know how old you are.    The NHS voucher money will be deducted from the total cost of the glasses. So if without the voucher, you're buying a 200 frame, and the NHS voucher is for 60, you'll be paying 140 instead.    :-)|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Depends on the size of your face ...     If you still have a boy-ish face, shape ... Then it will be the under 16's section.     If you are more developed and look more adult...   Then you will be allowed to chose from the mens section.    All depends on your face structure...     But i do however believe that the designer glasses are available in childrens (under 16's) sizes now ...|`|0a9CLRd7aa	you can if you have credit card because they don't accept checks|`|2JqajMgeaa	Yes you can,    you will get a discount of 35 with an NHS voucher, and then a possible 10% for anything extra.    You will then have to pay the remaining amount which will be about 50|`|C1MHKd5Laa	Can I ask how your entitled to this NHS voucher, I'm 16 too and I have got mens glasses btw ;)    They were 30 as there was a special offer on. They are not designer glasses altho they look a bit like adidas ones as they have 3 stripes at either side :)
6mSfRjpxaa	Infectious mononucleosis (pronounced: mah-no-noo-klee-oh-sus), sometimes called "mono" or "the kissing disease," is an infection usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is very common, and many people have been exposed to the virus at some time in childhood.    Not everyone who is exposed to EBV develops the symptoms of mono, though. As with many viruses, it is possible to be exposed to and infected with EBV without becoming sick.    Symptoms usually begin to appear 4 to 7 weeks after infection with the virus. Signs that you may have mono include:    constant fatigue   fever   sore throat   loss of appetite   swollen lymph nodes (commonly called glands, located in your neck, underarms, and groin)   headaches   sore muscles   larger-than-normal liver or spleen   skin rash   abdominal pain|`|tcPaHzkUaa	I have mono.it makes you tired and weak ALOT.And yes it is contagious/|`|VHrLpbjQaa	There is an incubation period.. so you still might be infected.. Go to the doctor NOW and get a jump on it.. It might be preventable with a shot of immune booster.. Good luck.|`|l04kUKtHaa	Chillax, even if it is mono, it's no big deal. Heck, you may even get out of gym for a few weeks.    And unless you put your mouth on something she put her mouth on (like a glass), you're probably fine. If your belly starts hurting in your left side, I'd get checked out by the doctor. But really, if you expect mono, get checked out. But don't be too alarmed if you get that diagnosis. LOTS of kids get it.|`|OYq99U4Yaa	You never know i am guessing she got it from something else because you probaly would of caught it by now of you would be sleepy because when you get MONO you get VERY sleepy and you have to stay out of school for like 4 months ! I doubt you have it if you are fealing wearid just go  to the docter.|`|eug6CIMZaa	Anything that could have caused your saliva to come in contact in any way... sharing a straw, sharing an eating utensil, and of course kissing can cause you to be exposed to the virus. The disease has a long incubation period, sometimes not showing symptoms for 30-60 days. However, some of the early symptoms include constant fatigue, a constant state of feeling tired, enlarged glands, or lymph nodes, in the neck, armpit and groin. Other signs include a fever, sometimes up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit, a very sore throat, headaches, muscle aches, and an enlarged spleen.     On a personal note, I've known couples that have kissed and not transmitted the disease, so unless you were sharing the same piece of pizza, then just because you touched the same things does not mean you necessarily have it. If I were you I wouldn't worry about it just yet, if you start to feel extra tired constantly then I would go see your doctor for a simple blood test to diagnose it. Good Luck!
YbnqMe11aa	An old technique my super-old and probably Retired English teacher taught us ... 3 *DEEP* breathes through the nose and out the mouth ... all three should take about 30-45 seconds, so go very slow and very deep.    Most people do not breath properly to begin with (from their chest as opposed to the correct way which is from the belly), so 3 deep slow breathes helps re-oxygenate the brain.|`|iybezfi6aa	Study Intensely for short periods of time. If you can, increase the study time as you go.|`|ZLFgVHreaa	How about stay calm and breathe. Focus on one thing at a time, first and foremost is the exam. Good luck.|`|iWwsOK5Baa	Ok, so revising for exams can be abit.. boring, lol.     But you NEED TO DO IT IF YOU WANT TO GET GOOD GRADSE. =]    First of all, make sure your not eating, listening to music, not watching tv... basically make sure your mind is on ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY and that is revising.     Go onto good revision sites.. and revise...     Make a timetable... of everything you need to revise.. for eg:    6.00- Maths  7.00- English    And so on.. that would make it easier for you to revise from all the subjects your exams are based upon.    DON'T MULTI-TASK... !!! Keep your mind focused and on one thing...!    Just revise, revise, revise.. and be calm. Drink plenty of water as it's pretty healthy.      Dont eat junk food.... eat healthy food [fruit, veg etc].  Make sure you get good sleep everynight...  And just be calm and breathe slow...     Good Luck  :)|`|NWwGl4k6aa	go to a coffee shop or library.  maybe if you are studying at home, there are too many distractions.  i could never study at home.
Q4ggnG0waa	I'm fine during my chemo treatments, but about 2 days afterwards I get so tired I can't do much but lay around and nap. It takes about 2 days for the effects to wear off and I get back to normal pretty quickly. All I do during the rough times is rest and drink plenty of juices. I still have to have my coffee every morning though.    Danielle, I have my blood drawn every week and no problems at all with that, thank goodness. I'm taking 300 mg of temodar daily. That's a pretty large dose. Everyone is different and everyone's body responds differently.    If you're getting chemo, then you're getting your blood checked at LEAST every other week. If it gets low, red or white, your doc will take care of that problem.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Exercise if you can. It should help.    Make sure you're getting enough sleep.    Try to eat a balanced diet if you have the appetite, plenty of protein is very important on chemo to rebuild good cells.    Plenty of fluids to flush out the chemo.|`|mWBD1Mgyaa	My mother finished her chemo in december.  She would allow her body to sleep.  If you are so tired...rest.  Your body is being put through a lot.  Don't exhaust yourself.    My mom had a nurse come in for 10 days following her treatment to give her a shot to increase her white blood cells.  This was after the first treatment because she became so sick, she was hospitalized for 5 days.    On a happy note...We just found out yesterday that she is now CANCER FREE!!!  Keep your chin up!!  Miracles do happen!|`|vVfH8yBYaa	One of the first things I tell my patients is that we have a pill to treat everything... except fatigue. There is no pill for fatigue. The suggestion to get more iron is great, except that it's like providing building blocks to a company that has no builders. Fatigue associated with chemo is typically two-fold in nature. At first, it's your body dealing with the toxicity of the chemotherapy. These drugs are serious stuff and it's hard to tolerate. After the fatigue of the toxicity wears off, the fatigue of "nadir" sets in. This is that period when your cell counts are the lowest. Your body is doing it's best to create new cells, but the bone marrow is compromised as a result of the chemo. Lower hemoglobin levels means a lower oxygen-carrying capacity. Oxygen is energy for your body's other cells. Less cellular energy means less "you" energy.    There are ESAs (erythropoetin stimulating agents, Aranesp and Procrit) available that can increase red blood cell development rates, but the use of these are limited in cancer patients, because while they have some benefit they also have some risks, including the risk of increasing tumor growth. If your cancer is "curable", such as early stage breast, colon, etc. Your doc isn't going to want to use ESAs.    The only treatment is REST.     I hope you do well. Remember, chemo isn't forever. You will get through this and get back on your feet again.|`|AA11885973	Fatigue is a normal side effect of Chemotherapy.  Adjust your schedule so that you don't have any important engagements or appointments for the 2-3 days after treatment and you can sleep it off.  I'm surprised your oncologist didn't discuss this with you before starting treatment.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	-(joke)(Why you are worrying that  you want to sleep always, I do not have cancer still I want to sleep always!)  -There are many things you can do .Few things are already mentioned. If they dont work definitely we can try the remaining methods   -If you gain confidence mentally ,that will also reduce your fatigue, have you observed-if yes ,I can write to you many methods to gain confidence  -Read health magazines  -Develop many hobbies  -write answers to other peoples questions here ,that will reduce your fatigue as well as their fatigue!  -make email friend ship with female medical students   -prayer reduces fatigue at least if not cancer  -you can write e mails to me by clicking my profile here|`|XUrgcOMDaa	Try iron-rich things like red wine (a really good one, but talk to your doc about that one first), or any deep, red fruits and vegetables like beets, pomegranate, plums, etc...    If you have a juicer, you can make really potent drinks out of all kinds of fruits and veggies that are extremely full of vitamins that will rejuvenate you... though it can get a little pricey for the amount of produce you need.|`|zuOqbkdEaa	go to your doctor they may give you some sleeping tablets|`|FAQldsUZaa	Drink lots and lots of fluids

oy7mNHJNaa	I would try an oxy clean soak and then washing them in an all natural detergent.  I know it sounds odd but vinegar and baking soda does wonders in removing smells.

It works wonders on strange stains, and is the best stain remover I've found for those types of things.|`|od51qzQtaa	Well the first advice I must give with any infection. Actually bacterial vaginosis isn't an infection it is an inflammation of the vagina caused by an imbalance of the vaginas bacteria. nether the less I would always recommend a trip to your doctors to get it checked out first. The reason behind that is a doctor can give you a thorough check over and may find other problems that need looking at.      Do you have the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis? Some women can display no symptoms at all and still have underlying bacterial vaginosis, others will have some or all of the normal symptoms. A vagina discharge, either white, grey or even yellow in color. A unpleasant fishy odor which is more noticeable during or after sexual intercourse. Itching, which can be anything from a slight discomfort to an intense itch. A swelling of the vagina area, stomach pain similar to menstrual cramps. lastly pain or a burning sensation during urination. So all together a very unpleasant condition that needs to be treated quickly.    The doctor will more than likely prescribe a course of antibiotics, these can come in the form of tablets taken orally, creams applied externally or capsules which are inserted directly into the vagina. If prescribed antibiotics you must complete the whole course even if the symptoms disappear. The trouble with antibiotics is they work by killing the bacteria inside the vagina, which is OK as the inflammation will go but so will the natural balance of good bacteria within the vagina. It is this balance of good vs bad bacteria that keeps the vagina healthy. When bad bacteria takes over you get inflammation or BV. Antibiotics kill the good and bad bacteria so it is quite possible and pretty likely that the bacterial vaginosis will return.     The are a few things that you can do to limit your susceptibility to recurrent bacterial vaginosis they are as follows. It is imperative to keep yourself clean  the transfer of bacteria between anus and vagina is very common so that way in which you wipe is important. It has been known that thong wearing can transmit bad bacteria as the material rubs back and forth between anus and vagina.     As bacterial vaginosis is to do with the bacterial balance of the vagina it is thought that you can help this by a good diet. It is important that you eat good quality fruit and vegetables along with the correct amount of vitamins and minerals. You can get probiotic drinks, acidophilus pills or even eat natural yogurt. All of these things will help with your bodies own natural balance.
730d4e4d2243c2fd6c922fe68016b211aa	Okay...let's all be serious about this. I chose to do atkins a couple of years ago. It works very very well. HOWEVER....be weary of the good and bad fats. Make sure you eat healthy meals and choose the leanest meats possible. There are tons of meal choices and recipes. Induction is by far the hardest part but also the most motivational as you lose weight super fast on it (I lost 20 lbs in 4 weeks including induction) Check out these links for recipes:    http://www.cajuncookingrecipes.com/atkin...  http://forum.lowcarber.org/showthread.ph...  http://forum.lowcarber.org/archive/index...  http://genaw.com/lowcarb/induction_menus...  and of course www.atkins.com    Good Luck!|`|rJq8TxHGaa	You know the guy who created Atkins died of a heart attack?

It sounds to me like you have hives.  Hives are usually an allergic reaction to something, but can be brought on by stress and exercise.  Take 2-25 mg Benadryl or a Claritin or Alavert (or any medication made for seasonal allergies) and see if that takes care of the problem.  You may have to take them consistently for a couple of days.  If it does, you are having an allergic reaction to something.  Also, take warm showers, not hot.  I know, in this cold weather nothing feels better than a nice hot shower, but it can also be extremely drying to your skin.  Use a very mild soap in the shower, Dove is a good one.  When you get out of the shower, put a good moisurizer on like Eucerin or Keri lotion.|`|ZLFgVHreaa	Possibly chicken pox. Go to the doctor to check it out.|`|NnY1A6P2aa	Chicken pox perhaps?

Have you ever had the chicken pox b4? If that's the case, then you should go get the injection from your doctor or the spots could scar and never go away. Don't worry, I've gotten the vacination like 3 times and it does NOT hurt at all, so don't be scared. Do NOT scratch, pinch, or rub them. They could spread or even pop and that's really gross. I don't think it has anything to do with showers, but what your experiencing sounds a lot like the chicken pox. I really recommend seeing a doctor. Always check with a doctor. Hope I helped!!!    Always,  (-:Tabbykinz:-)|`|1s7Ws8j5aa	the same thing happens to me when i get out of the shower.  its above my belly button and up to around my chest. i also take hot showers. i have never had the chicken pox but its not that because it goes away a while after. i do have eczema. i have gotten hives before but i got it on my legs and arms, and the spots on my stomach are different from when i had hives. i really dont know exactly what the spots are called and i havent asked my doctor about that yet but he recommend staying away from hot showers for my skin.

NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was theweightlossplace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.

TJrOvRVBaa	k Lets see here.  You should've been a little more specific.  Are we talking just free weight lifting or/and calisthenics?      If doing free weights with light weight/moderate intensity you're looking at about 115 calories burned in a half hour.      Now if your doing all out intense heavy weightlifting your looking at about 230 calories burned in a half hour.    If your doing just calisthenics (pushups,dips pullups etc.)  You're looking at about 300 calories burned in a half hour.    I suggest you join Fitday.com  Easy to use and you can calculate how many calories you burn on average a day.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It would depend on how intense the workout is.

ljVwo5qZaa	Yes, you can mix creatine w/ whey and milk. The typical serving size for creatine is 1tsp which = 5g.     Post workout you want to have quick carbs (sugar), protein, and creatine. The easiest post workout shake to make is to have about 16oz of chocolate milk, 1scoop of whey, and 1 tsp of creatine. This will give you an idea combo of carbs, protein, and creatine.|`|rJq8TxHGaa	I usually just have Whey Protein pre/post workout and creatine before I go to bed.    OPPS, made a mistake!

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Its not when is a girl most fertile, she is either fertile or not fertile on any given day, a  woman will ovulate one day per menstrual cycle, this takes place around two weeks before menstruation  around day 12-16 of an average menstrual cycle. The egg will only live up to 48 hours however within that time two or more eggs may also be released so all together a woman may be able to get pregnant for a day or two. About a week prior to ovulation the body produces fertile quality cervical mucus which helps protect the sperm and help it reach the egg, the woman is fertile for as long as there is cervical mucus leading up to ovulation as this cervical mucus can keep sperm alive within the vagina for up to 7 days. So a woman will be fertile during ovulation two weeks before menstruation and for a few days either side when fertile quality cervical mucus is present. The idea that you can get pregnant any time is pure myth, it's a half-truth scare tactic taught in sex education classes to make us aware that if not using birth control you can get pregnant. As many people don't take responsibility with their sexual health by studying outside of the classroom they continue to believe this myth, and don't apply common sense that would tell them that there are in fact 'safe days'.     But a word of warning, dont try to guess the days when you are not fertile, by what is considered average or by your previous cycles, this unreliable method we call the Rhythm Method, and we call users of this method...parents. You can however use methods such as Fertility Awareness Method http://www.tcoyf.com which is 98% effective, for this you would chart basal body temperature, cervical mucus and cervical position daily to determine when you are fertile or not.|`|mnJFsKmDaa	A girl is most fertile approx 7 - 14 days after her time of the month.  This depends on the girl though, some women are more fertile than others.    A woman next to an average cycle is, on average roughly 14 days after the start of her spell. However, this does not plan that it wouldn't be the one and only time your body ovulated that month or even the time at adjectives that you'd ovulate. Some women even ovulate while they are menstruating. It's difficult to track your ovulation cycle, and if you really want to find out, seeing a doctor and have him/her facilitate you track it would be the best resort.

rnNoD1braa	Eating only Fiber One will be detrimental to your health...    Your body needs many different vitamins and minerals and protein to function-or it'll never burn fat. Your body will instinctively resort to "survival" mode and save your fat for energy.    Believe me-I lost almost 300 pounds in under a year.    You've got to change what you eat, and how.    First realize half the food Americans eat is fake and artificial.  If you can, buy as organic and naturally-occurring as you can.  Make sure your not eating "empty" calories.     Stick to a low-fat diet with "super"foods like salmon, tuna, broccoli, walnuts, oranges, kiwifruit and buffalo meat, etc.     Fiber itself is meant to aid in digestion-in other words, it'll help you poop.  But if your not eating anything else-what's there to poop? Nothing.

Getting this sorted really depends on the severity of the problem - if say, your brother is borrowing your hair curlers without asking (I doubt this is the case) then you need to grin and bear it.    By the sounds of things, it runs deeper and more serious than that. Getting a good education is important and you deserve credit for recognising the impact this issue is having on you and your studies.     If you have any close family or friends - aunties, or uncles you trust - then you may be able to stay with them a while. Or maybe you could even stay at a friend's house. At any rate if you choose to do this - your mum needs to know you're safe, even if you don't tell them where you are. Otherwise the police may get involved.    Without knowing exatly what your brother has done, it's hard to know what to say. If you're really stuck, and you feel your friends can't help, try ringing The Samaritans. It's free, and they'll talk to you about whatever your problem is. They may even be able to give you more information about hostels and refuges in your area. And if even that seems beyond you, then send a message to me, and I'll give you the best advice I can.    -happy moth x

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	Cavities are infection and the teeth area has low blood flow in many parts of it.  The immune system has a very difficult time dealing with these areas due to the low blood flow and the only way to address the problem is to remove the infection.  If you let it go, the infection will continue.  When the infection gets to the nerve, this is when you will feel pain due to the inflammation swelling putting pressure on the nerve.  Any trauma to a tooth affects the health of the nerve.  After about 3 or 4 traumas to a nerve, it dies, typically.  When this happens, the infection can increase at a rapid rate and you get abscessing and a rapid deterioration of tissue.  This can be life threatening and many people have actually died from this problem.     Modern dentistry was started in 1915 by Dr. Black, DDS.  He was not only a dentist with vision, but a good researcher.  He recognized many of the problems surrounding infection, one of which still exists today and is being ignored by dentists following their "standard of care" that protects them legally from being sued over this issue.    When a person in the United States has a tooth that requires pulling or a root canal, they will typically drill out the insides of the tooth's root (nerve) and fill the tooth with metal rods or Gutta Percha (a latex like material).  This is called a "root canal." Root canals are a safe haven for microbes. Because no blood reaches the inside of the tooth, the immune system cannot kill any microbes inside the dead tooth.  Microbes do not originate in the root canals, rather they originate elsewhere in the body (such as where cancer cells form). The microbes thrive and some of them hide from the immune system inside the root canals.  These microbes, and other toxins from inside the tooth, periodically come out of the tooth and cause reinfections.     All of these things have been known about for decades by the American Dental Association.     Root canals are a major cause of the immune system being suppressed and they are a major cause of cancer:   "Dr. Thomas Rau, who runs the Paracelsus Clinic (cancer clinic since 1958) in Switzerland recently checked the records of the last 150 breast cancer patients treated in his clinic. He found that 147 of them (98%) had one or more root canal teeth on the same meridian as the original breast cancer tumor. His clinic has a biological dentist section where all cancer patients, on reporting in, have their mouth cleaned up first -- especially all root canal teeth removed.     There are about 24 million root canals done in the U.S. alone every year. They were proven deadly disease agents in 1925 in a study by Dr. Weston Price and 60 prominent researchers. That study has been suppressed ever since by the ADA and the American Association of Endodontists (AAE). Read the book "Root Canal Cover-Up" by George Meinig, DDS, FACD for the full story. Dr. Meinig was an endodontist for 50 years. He helped found the AAE in 1943. His book is a mea culpa (apology) to the thousands of patients whose health he ruined doing root canal fillings. He discovered the Weston Price research only after he retired in 1993. His book was published first in 1994 and he has lectured widely since then trying to alert people to this danger to their health.     There are procedures that have been developed to allow a root canal to be done properly, but it is NOT typically used by the average dentist and so the problems continue.  The biggest problem associated with typical root canals is "NICO" (neuralgia induced cavitational osteonecrosis) or deterioration of the jaw bone.  This condition depletes the body of it's minerals and many diseases and conditions happen to the person with no connection being made by anyone that the teeth are causing the problems.  There is NO PAIN associated with NICO, so it is typically ignored by dentists and patients.    Your teeth need to be taken care of properly or you will pay a dear price with many diseases that can potentially end up taking your life.  Do NOT ignore your teeth.    Yes, your diet has a direct affect on the teeth and can slow the progression, but not stop it due to the low immune response that happens in the teeth area.  I strongly suggest you see a Certified Nutritional Therapist to help you with that diet and not rely on the typical medical guys to advise you on that because they are really ignorant about nutrition.    Primitive people did NOT get cavities and died with perfect teeth in their mouths.  Their food supply was very different than ours found in modern societies.  A very good book for you to read is, "Nutrition and Physical Degeneration" by Dr. Weston A. Price, DDS.    good luck to you|`|1nINGDC7aa	Sometimes if the caries get arrested ie they donot progress at all then there is no pain. That happens if you maintain good oral hyg. But some times if it is chronic case then it can progress slowly but doesnot have any symptoms. So it is better to not to delay the things and visit the dentist.

How often are you washing your hair?    Every day? Cut back to every other day.    If you are using 1 type of shampoo, switch it up. Use 2 types every other time.     I was my hair every other day. I use Herbal Essence Volume Shampoo and its separate Conditioner.  The Next time I use Aussie's Moist Shampoo and it's separate Conditioner.    Any shampoo with Moist or Hydrate will keep your hair and your scalp moisturized. Dandruff to me is because your hair is dry that's why it's flaky so I would need something to keep my hair hydrated just like you need water to keep your body from dehydrated.    I have tried to use those combination Shampoo and Conditioner in 1 - does not work for me. I have to use a separate bottles. Leave the conditioner in for a bit longer before you rinse.    Last but not least: What's your diet like? Are you drinking enough water a day. Do you eat fried foods, chips, candy alot? Got to cut that back.
7d4679dd4f83cd75389d5336efd16799aa	I was a gymnast for years (right-handed, left-legged), and it is perfectly normal for your non-dominant limbs to be weaker. However, you should work on toning them up. If nothing else, you might try to do a few tasks that you normally would with your left hand with your right--washing your face, eating with a spoon, etcetera. I would recommend some strength training however, all around. For your arms, use dumbells and not weight machines so that your dominant arm cannot compensate for the other. I've not really seen people have a "thinner" leg, but if it is not drastic, it is probably of no consequence. Many people are not built perfectly symmetrically, so you have nothing to worry about!
688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Do not put ANTYHING on your skin until it heals!  When you burn the outer layers of the skin, you are exposing layers that are not ready to take any kind of cream.      You may be ok to try petroleum jelly (unscented) to relieve any burning.  But I wouldn't suggest anything else.    It will take between 2 weeks and one month for the skn to recover because that's how long it takes for the new skin layer to rise to the surface.    5 years is way beyond a helathy shelf life for any skin cream.  Generally, skin creams have a three year shelf life, but that varies depending on the container.  Some will expire much sooner.    And with ANY skin treatment, if it tingles, it NOT good.  Burning is NEVER good.  It doesn't mean it's "working" no matter what the sales person tells you.  So if you ever try a product and it tingles, take it off immediately.

I guarantee they care more about their bottom line, which everybody knows what it is for any business: $    I don't trust all that stuff either and I've seen the lives of friends changed.  Sure, some people don't seem to be affected as much, but the truth is that in some cases your body is affected without you realizing.  Then people wake up 20 years later and wonder why their body is all messed up... duh... everything has a price.  I'm a proponent of the NFP method of birth control.  it has worked well for us, and I don't have to worry about what weird hormones my wife might have to put in her body.  There are also psychological/emotional changes that can be caused by the pill.  read up on the "divorce pill" issue.  Apparently there's a study that found that women on the pill have a shift in the type of person they're attracted to.  So once they make a change,  all of the sudden they can't stand their spouse because basically when they got together they were "under the influence".    It may be a subtle effect, but why would someone want to deal with that kind of possibility?  I mean geez, don't we have enough problems?    Oh, there's also the "aspirin birth control method".   that is extremely safe.  have you heard about it?    you take an aspirin tablet when you go to bed and hold it between your knees by keeping your legs closed.  As long as you make sure the tablet doesn't fall out, your chances of getting pregnant are greatly diminished.   ok,  for those that don't get it, it's a joke.|`|lSaCUg0yaa	So why do you want to go on the pill?  Just use condoms|`|0UZmS2mWaa	Look into the Nuva ring.|`|4NcshCDvaa	I was prescribed a hormone birth control for a medical reason...and it messed everything up way more than the problem I had before. I had normal periods before but when I started taking it they were crazy messed up. Then I had the worst cramps of my life and they almost made me throw up every time.     I am now not taking it. And the doctor said that some peoples body just doesn't adjust to the change that the pill makes.     I mean there are tons of women that take it..but it didn't work for me.|`|SZ6q8Jfxaa	if you're really concerned about side effects from the hormones, DO NOT get the depo shot. although it doesn't affect everyone, alot of women have terrible side effects such as weight gain, hair loss, depression, bone density loss. the pill can have some side effects, but if you want a very effective method of bc then the pill is a good way to go. to minimize side effects get on a low dose pill like yaz or loestrin 24 fe. there are a handful of others but those two are the name brands. those are for women who do have side effects on other pills, and most times you are not likely to have serious side effects. the most common is spotting or bleeding between periods and in that case it usually goes away in 3 months. the nuvaring is also a good choice if you cant remember pills. its a low dose of hormones and it doesn't go through the lining of the stomach so you're not likely to be nauseous on the ring. the non hormonal IUD is a good choice, but it does carry some risks if you've never had a child. i've known several people that have used it that don't have children, and they didn't have any problems. what is possible is you could get an infection that causes sterility, and that is why most doctors prefer you have a child first- its kinda like risk management. but some doctors will insert the IUD without you having a child. you may have cramping because your cervix hasn't had the trauma of childbirth. but that's something your doctor can go over with you. if you get a non hormonal IUD it wont generally affect your cycles, and it usually wont regulate them either plus it doesn't have the hormone side effects of other bc. The Mirena is hormonal.  good luck choosing!
koAaPXKQaa	This is called "haemoptysis". This could be caused by his recent pneumonia, but any sign of unexplained coughing blood should be treated as a medical emergency.     Blood brought up with a cough may be bubbly and bright red because it's mixed with air and mucus. It depends how much blood he brought up and how often it is happening. It is usually associated with blood coming from below the larynx.    There are too many different reason's that this may have happened, and I wont list them because some of the possibilities would only make you worry.

09b317729060c9dedb69f8059c07c3d0aa	First of all, they are only at higher risk for TYPE 2 diabetes (the form often related to obesity and lifestyle).     Type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease, is usually found in *whites* of *Northern European* decent. Finland has the highest rate of Type 1 diabetes (and Celiac Disease, another related autoimmune disease) in the world.     That said, specific cultural foods/preference for larger figures, etc. does play a role, as pointed out above.     But genetic disposition also plays a role. One theory is the "thrifty gene" theory. The theory is that those who have survived extreme famines (such as many with African heritage) and hardships developed a genetic advantage at the time. That advantage was the ability to utilize small amounts of food more efficiently and put on extra weight easily, which would help them to survive food shortages. Those with this featured survived, while those who could not starved to death and left the gene pool. Food abundance and that genetic combo in today's world is deadly for them unless they are strict with their diet. Another theory is that these ethnic groups do not adapt well to eating the grains and processed foods commonly found today in a typical Western diet.     Overall, this is a more complex topic than it looks. Some reasons why non-whites seem to have higher rates of Type 2 diabetes:    -Higher genetic disposition as mentioned  -Inability for these groups to adapt to common food sources (i.e. modern processed grains).  -Culture that encourages a "fuller" figure, or does not see it as a bad thing to be overweight, even if that person's health is at risk.  -Cultural foods (I.e. high carb, fried, large portions, etc.)  -Socioeconomic factors. In some cases, there is a disproportionate amount of blacks, Hispanics, etc. in poorer areas and ghettos. Their access to healthy foods, as well as nutritional education is more limited. Thankfully, governments and charity groups are beginning to start healthy school lunch programs, educational programs, and community gardens in those areas.  -A lack of Type 2 diabetes prevention information for those that do not speak English as their first language (I.e. booklets in Spanish).  -Some of these cultures either do not take the threat of Type 2 diabetes seriously, which leads to ignoring the problem. Often in the black community, someone will say that their mom has "a touch of the sugar" and not realize that they too are at risk and need to make changes.    I don't mean to generalize, just give as many ideas as possible. To summarize, it appears as though certain ethnic groups have a higher genetic risk for Type 2 diabetes. In some cases, these genetic combined with their environment, attitudes, and culture leads to a high rate of Type 2 diabetes.    Generally speaking, a higher genetic risk of Type 2 diabetes means that those in these groups may need less of the enviromental triggers to set the disease off.|`|ubofHDxPaa	There is a theory that they need more exercise in general to keep their sugar levels down low. I think it's from the sedimentary lifestyle that they live now where they don't get much exercise that causes the problems Also, the ingestion of high carb foods.|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Cultural preferences for corn and more refined carbohydrates, less health care or indifferent health care so detection is not as early, and poor follow care.|`|gNBKvQuMaa	DIET!!

I do but I am neither.GMO's and SOY are a part in this hellish game they are playing with our food.You might consider doing more research independently, going outside the box of your past because its Blind Trust you and many allow to lead them down this road of poor health plus what you believe is what you will receive, like karma but in actuality its the Law of Attraction, like attracts like or dislike.|`|Z6AX6t4Aaa	u know...i noticed tht...  like...every old person in my fam either has it,or is border-line diabetic in my family

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Sex should never be painful, if it is hurting dont tolerate the pain, stop if it hurts and address the problem. Vagina's are amazing, they can handle a baby so can easily take a penis, giving birth can be painful but vagina's are designed so sex shouldn't be, when aroused it actually doubles in size, opens, lubricates and muscles relax so penetration is possible and pleasurable. Arousal prepares the vagina for sex to prevent pain, penetration isn't the main attraction but often people rush foreplay forgetting it's part of sex and can be more fun than penetration, if they rush then penetration is painful because the vagina isnt ready for it  you have to wait until youre wet, its how sex works! Id recommend that you read up a little about how your body works and about sex, in not knowing things like this youre not only causing yourself pain and putting yourself at risk when your vagina is getting damaged, but youre stopping yourself from having a fun and pleasurable sex life. Lubrication helps too if your not wet enough, it's not a replacement for good foreplay but part of safe sex and adds to pleasure, although you need to know your stuff as different lubes are for different things. Buy yourself some good quality lubrication, but make sure to be lube-smart, try different lubes but remember oil-based will damage condoms and silicone-based will damage silicone.     Sex is a lot about emotions too, many girls have sex because low self-esteem means they think a guy won't love them otherwise or will get a bad reputation, as they aren't ready for sex they tense up so penetration is forced making it painful, this is true of virgins and non-virgins alike. It's also true that if you expect sex to be painful you will tense up making penetration difficult and painful. Know what you want and talk to your partner, if you don't tell a guy you're not ready or it hurts he can't be held responsible, demand good sex by telling him how you feel and what turns you on, enjoy whatever happens safe in the knowledge that if it does hurt you can stop, no good guy would think badly of you for this and it won't be the end of the world.

PM23RDycaa	Heh I hate needles as well; ivs, shots, you name it, and yet I have several tattoos. I have donated blood twice both times while I was in high school one to help out since I am AB pos and because I wanted to get out of my 2nd period classes.    Anyways the thing is to not think about it. Don't watch when they check your iron levels though the little finger stick is easy compared to whats next. And DEFIANTLY try not to look when they are hooking you up. I watched the second time but not the first as they did it. After the initial penetration of the needle I was fine with watching the bag fill.    I won't share what happened with my first donation because it was a total freak accident but I will say it did not stop me from donating my senior year. Haven't donated in a while simply because I have been getting inked pretty regularly.     Just focus on the juice and the cookies afterward and the really gnarly bruise you will probably get afterward.    Deep breaths and stare at something across the room while they are doing it.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Certainly can be scary-- but just remember that's it's temporary, and should only last about 20 minutes.    Keep your breathing steady, and be sure to share with the technician what's going on with you, so they can better accomodate you, sometimes they'll give you somethign to cover your eyes, or have a friend stand by you to hold your hand, whichever they and you are comfortable with.    And as Rayven said-- juice and cookies afterward! YEAH!|`|AA10251905	first off needle phobia is real. I am sure you can get over it if you put your mind to it.  first think about it. did the shot you got actually hurt as bad as you thought it would? probably not. try  to not look at the needle, think about something pleasant, put on a head phone and listen to some music you like. It will take a lot of will power on your part to overcome this, But it can be done. I know because I did it. I still don't like shots! but I can take them without completely freaking out over it. you can to.  I want to praze you for giving blood it is a very generous thing to do. you will save someones life with your donation. good luck.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Okay I am here to take your blood, I should be telling you to take slow deep breathes and exhale...if they do not, you must do it....this will help your heart rate go down and you get calmer..    Legit: Slow deep breaths, and try to thing of your dogs, or anything but where you are at...this is the only way to calm yourself, take it out of your mind...and do ont look at the person doingi it, or even towards the needle....let them know, hey, I am really terrified of needles and they will help calm you down..    I know the needle thing is bad, I am also that way....and this is no joke, you can call my doctor, you think you have needle probvlems..    Okay, in 2002, I had  broken my right elbow and the bone was sticking out of the skin, my horse then Stalion put me a barb wire fence, yes he did.....anyway    I had surgey that night...they could not get the pain to stop and my blood pressure was high, no matter what they did, the Morphine, Demerol, forget it...so the surgeon came in and told me and my husband, he was gonna have to do a block to stop the pain, and it would deaden it for several hours and then the pain would come back but would be under control.    So, they took me back to surgery room, and proceded to do a Marcaine block into my neck on the right side, it was suppose to go into the nerve, ha, no way, all of sudden, I felt this sharp twinge and I could not stop shaking, then the next thing I knew, I woke up 8 days later in ICU, on IV's galore and a catherer, my kidneys had shut down, my heart had stopped for 3 mins, I was clinicaly dead he said...he hit the jugular vein and all the med went into my system.....he said he thought he had killed me.....so, 2 days later, I was put back into a regular room and 5 days later got to go home...what was suppose to be a few days in the hospital for elbow surgery ended up in a nightmare.    I became so afraid of needles, that I could no longer give myself my insulin shots, I am a diabetic..I got really sick with it then, I was put on tablet after tablet, nothing worked....and then bam, it got back under control after almost a year later.....I have never been on insulin since, and today when they have to draw blood, this is the truth for real, the am before they have me take a Xanax before going to the docs office, and I cant drive..    Now, see why I always have said, if you can get your diabetes control anyone, and get off the needles.....I can't handle them at all, I freak to this day...and any surgeries since, they have to give me a shot to almost knock me out to get an IV in..    So, I feel your pain an understand, and you it is not being childish at all, maybe if your that bad, you can do some other community service, and leave the needles alone....LOL  I know its not funny, but sometimes we have to laugh at ourselves...    No one is too old to have phobia's, and needle ones to me are the worse you can have.    good luck,  and be safe..

Try new things and see what you like and dislike. OR it could be medically related somehow. You should talk to your doctor and be completely honest about whats been going on with your emotions. Maybe even speak to a counselor or therapist. There's nothing wrong with asking for help.

You might be convincing yourself that things are worse than they are or you just get the urge to cry. Reassure yourself that you have a good life; better than most people.    If that isn't the case, then do you have a rough past? Do you think about that at night? I know laying in bed at night is when it's so hard not to think about anything. So many things come to mind and maybe you are remembering the bad things and that is making you cry.

You didn't by any chance (and this is going to sound utterly disgusting) save any of what came out of you, like the "flesh colored sac"? sounds like something weird going on, and you should go in for a full exam to make sure. The only thing other than miscarriage I can think of is maybe (and this is also going to sound gross) but maybe is there a chance you forgot a tampon up there a while back? Yes, nasty, but it does happen. Normally too, I don't have much bleeding now that I've been on the pill for a long time, so the amount of blood you're reporting is alarming. I would make an appointment with a new doctor for a full pelvic exam. Good Luck!
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Sex should never be painful, so if there is pain it might be a good idea to talk to a doctor about it to find a possible cause, chances are its down to lack of arousal or lack of lubrication and its being made worse by the fear you have about the possibility of pain.     Vagina's are amazing, they can handle a baby so can easily take a penis, giving birth can be painful but vagina's are designed so sex shouldn't be, when aroused it actually doubles in size, opens, lubricates and muscles relax so penetration is possible and pleasurable. Arousal prepares the vagina for sex to prevent pain, penetration isn't the main attraction but often people rush foreplay forgetting it's part of sex and can be more fun than penetration, in doing this the vagina doesnt prepare fully for sex so it can cause pain. Lubrication helps too if your not wet enough, it's not a replacement for good foreplay but part of safe sex and adds to pleasure, although you need to know your stuff as different lubes are for different things. Buy yourself some good quality lubrication, but make sure to be lube-smart, try different lubes but remember oil-based will damage condoms and silicone-based will damage silicone.    I'd recommend this article from a very good site called Scarleteen on the subject of painful sex 'From Ow! To Wow! Demystifying Painful Intercourse http://www.scarleteen.com/article/pink/f...|`|RoqxGbgRaa	a small percentage of women are actually allergic to semen.    also, it could be that you were not relaxed enough and had your muscles clenched during sex, or that you were not lubricated enough.  the result of that second one could be a series of tiny tears in the vaginal canal that hurt or sting later.    either way, see your doc.|`|GO7tZtPxaa	I watched embarassing illnesses and a girl had exactly the same thing and now I cant remember what they said it was...

For that I would recommend lots and lots of foreplay and/or a good lube.  There really are some great ones on the market that aren't icky and gross, but feel natural and light.    Sex shouldn't hurt.  I hope you can get this taken care of!  Best of luck to you.|`|CoalvZDkaa	I suppose you can go to visit your ginecologist and quickly solve your problem.

1ggESF58aa	Don't be discouraged!  Losing weight is VERY hard to do.  It takes longer than two weeks, and much more effort than just an hour of cardio every other day (or even everyday).    First, I want you to go here and calculate your basal metabolic rate:    http://health.drgily.com/basal-metabolic...    This will give you two numbers - your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and energy requirements.    The BMR is how many calories your body needs in a day to funcion without any kind of exercise.  So if you were to wake up and sit in bed all day, then go to sleep, in a 24 hour period, your body will "burn" the amount of calories in your BMR (for example, at my height, age, and weight, I burn about 1500 calories without having to do anything).    Your energy requirement number is the amount of calories your body needs to maintain your current weight.  The more you weigh the higher this number is.    Your daily calorie intake should be within these two numbers if you want to lose weight.  I would suggest 300-500 calories less than your daily energy requirement as long as the resulting number is not below 1300 calories (the bare minimum you should consume).    You need to pay close attention to how many calories the food you eat contains.  Plan out your meals to control your caloric intake, and ensure that your meals have a high variety of vegetables, fruits, meats, oats and grains, and dairy to ensure you also get all ofthe nutrients your body needs.  Avoid eating before you go to bed (allow two hours after your last big meal before going to bed), and avoid carbs and sugars at night.  Carbs are best in the morning (oats amd wheats), and protein is best after exercise or in the morning and at night.  Small meals planned consistently throughout the day is the best regimen... for example portion your meals smaller (around 5-6 portions) and eat a portion every 2-3 hours, assuming your active (at least awake) for 16 hours a day.  This regimen wil provide you with enough energy for those three hours, and usually nothing more.      If you consume more calories than you body needs when it metabolizes the energy, it will store the calories as fat until it needs it.  So if you consume more calories in a day than your body needs, you will gain weight, if you consume less, then you will lose weight.   his, coupled with exercise to help "burn" even more calories, will speed up your weight loss.  This is the most effective way, short of risky surgery, that I have experienced to lose weight.  A lady in my office lost about 90 lbs in 8 months by doing nothing but counting calories and long walks every day... and she's in her 50's!    Stay away from crazy fad diets, and focus more on the physics of your body.  Eat healthy, consume the right amount of calories - exercise is a good way to futher control your calorie intake (if you happen to eat more calories, then do more exercising).  Your body willeventually start drawing the calories it needs from your fat, and that is when you start losing weight.|`|B12E4rYiaa	You don't mention your diet. Are you keeping close track of your calories writing down everything you eat and drink so you know what's what?     The diet and exercise go hand in hand and it takes longer than 2 weeks to change a lifestyle this has to be a forever commitment. Otherwise you will be on a gain and lose cycle that never ends.|`|x1Bxehhcaa	if you're eating crap you're not gonna lose weight. diet and exercise go hand in hand. how is your diet? how much are you eating? keep in mind that exercise can increase appetite since you are burning extra calories and your body will want to make up for it. if you're having problems staying full, you can try a trick as you eat. after every bite of food, take a sip of water. this will force you to eat more slowly and your body will better recognize when its full, and the water will take up space and fill you up faster anyway. give it a try,|`|rJq8TxHGaa	It takes more than 2 weeks to see results - if you work HARD you could see dramatic results in 6 months, if you're lucky. It takes a long time to transform your body, and it also takes a lot of good old fashioned hard work.    If you do cardio and diet right you will see results in a few months. You can always speed up the process by lifting weights though!|`|RstbVDSUaa	Hi Jess,    I hate going to the gym. It's not my favourite place. First thing though is to concentrate on why you are not being motivated? is it because you don't like going to the gym? workout is too extreme or getting to boring and same-ish for you? Why not try a different method of losing weight?    What do you love doing? If you love sport then why not join a local sports team. Good way to socialise and lose weight. If not try a fitness dvd. Something different from the gym, like yoga or pilates. Great way to start relaxing.     If these do not interest you then why not try my personal favourite, belly dancing? You don't need to be of any particular size and can help tone and strengthen problem areas.     Diet is also important. You'll need food that gives you plenty of energy to get your spirits up so do get your 5 a day.    Good luck with your weight loss.

de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	Cardiovascular exercises help burning calories pretty well.    And my favourite exercise is jogging. I used to run, but I am more fond of jogging.|`|b9wICW1Paa	I agree with Nick.  Just about any activity you perform will use muscles, and will potentially make them grow, even just standing in place.      And there's no such thing as "toning."  Your muscles respond to load by growing larger or atrophy from lack of use.  The process is more complicated, but you don't need to worry about bulking up by doing weight or other resistance training.    Incorporate resistance and endurance training and you'll probably meet all of your fitness goals.  I'd recommend running, sprinting, walking, jumping, jumping rope, swimming, sports, and free weight or body weight training.      My favorite exercise is anything from which I get a great workout but that doesn't feel like exercise because it's fun.  Swimming in a lake, ocean, or other natural body of water would be high on my list.|`|q9i5f0rXaa	Every exercise burns calories.  If you're asking which exercises are superior for burning fat, well the answer is a little complicated.  Aerobic activity (i.e.) generally burns more fat during the activity itself, but anaerobic activity (i.e. lifting weights) generally results in an "afterburn effect" which results in an increased metabolic rate for hours after the exercise.  So generally, weights are superior.  Also don't forget that the more muscle you have, the more calories you'll burn.|`|AA11575150	Cardio workouts burns more calories than strength training though these are great exercises in there own right,I find Pilate's quite relaxing.  My favourite cardio workouts are a mix really of these things :running,elliptical,swimming another exercise that makes you feel relaxed but its a great calorie burner,jumping rope it burns a lot too,I have a mini trampoline which is fun to use and then I love walking too.If I am too tired to run then I walk on an incline on the treadmill.Walking is great though so try and not count it out it will help you lose weight all over and will tone you at the same time.    Good luck.
JFo1tiaQaa	Yes, I think its serious. There could be a few reasons for your stiff neck. Were u involved in an car accident or some kind of trauma? Also, you say that you are fatigued, when was the last time you had your blood work done- you may be deficient in iron.     A stiff neck can also be caused from:  - turning your head and neck unexpectedly in one direction  - working on a computer or at a desk job for a prolonged period of time  - car accident that caused your neck to have whiplash  - a misalignment in your neck  that is causing you to have muscle spasms.   - sleeping in an awkward position at night may be causing stiffness in your neck and upper back. Do you have enough support while u r sleeping? Sometimes using too many pillows or not enough can be the culprit.   - some type of infection- there is an infection that is transmitted by ticks called Borreliosis or Lyme Disease . Early symptoms of that include fever, headache, fatigue, depression, and a characteristic skin rash (bulls eye rash). You have to go to your PCP for medication and treatment. Not treating this in time can make it more difficult to treat.     Hope this helps you out.|`|5TM9P8tsaa	*Flu, mono. Do not try to self diagnose.

The doctor gave Lidocain to numb the areas and he got them by the roots.  One roots has so many extensions on it. it looked like a miniature tree root.  Perhaps in today's medicine, there may be an alternative way to get rid of them.  As of yet, I haven't seen it.  Then again, I have only seen 3 patients who had to have this done.  All of them were women for the same reason you got yours, only the warts were on the men.  I suggest you see an MD.  Do you know how many you have?  Oh, I also saw one removed from a woman's tongue.  I'm not trying to scare you, but they need to be taken care of because they will spread and being a virus, and antibiotic will not get rid of them.  Sorry, but those are the facts.

The reason we should eat small meals every two hours, or so, is that helps the metabolism stay steady, and the glucose (sugar) levels stay steady, and that helps us burn more calories... depending on what is eaten......  the 'calories' actually do carry over to the next day in the form of stored fat.....

Z0SiMz7daa	Very rare to "knock you out" to remove a cyst.  Probably the doctor will use a local anesthetic to inject in to the area around the cyst and this will make the area "numb" then remove the cysts.  Probably won't need to shave the areas where the cysts are unless he can't get to them and then I am sure they will try to minimize the amount of hair removed.  Shouldn't be too painful except for a little pain and burning when the anesthetic is injected.

The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.    Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.    Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise.

It would be better to stick with whole food proteins, carbs and fats.  Yet a good whole food diet + basic supplements is the best combo.    Do you need them no?  Do they help? yes.  You will be fine with a good whey protein from Optimum Nutrition or Dymatize (one I've been using).  Also you can buy a casein protein powder for before bed.  Optimum Nutrition has one also.  Another real good website that's doesn't feed you bs supplements is trueprotein.com (if you order from here tell em Carlos sent you)  where I'm going to start ordering from because of how cheap and quality it is.    I also have a feeling your diet and training is horrible.  You can not soley rely on a supplement to give you results.  Hell not even steroids will help you if you don't have that true motivation to train hard and eat right.      So I suggest you a take a real hard look at your current diet, training program and intensity in the gym. Remember eat more calories then you burn in a day and you will leave your body with no choice to build muscle given that you provided a strong enough stimulus in the gym.

There are many ways to diagnose cancer but it depends on the type.  A biopsy is where a piece of the tumor is extracted and examined under the microscope.  Xrays can determine the presence of tumors but really don't explain what kind of tumor it is.

Ya know how many poeple die of starvation daily? You have the luxury of being able to have a computer in your home nad post this question. Something people can only dream about.    You need to really look at everything that you have already adn not what is going wrong or what you dont have.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Stop concentrating so much on yourself. Donate your time to a charity that helps the sick or dying. when you give of yourself even if you feel you have nothing to give, you are given back more than you ever dreamed.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	The problem is that you are self-centered and are thinking only of yourself. Think about what it is like to be another person. Try caring for others, and try to feel what they may be feeling. Stop living inside your head and live for the moment. When you ruminate about the past, or worry about the future, you are not living in the present, but you're wasting your life in a fantasy land.    This is not to insult you, but it is simply a fact that every person has to make an effort to live in the moment and stop worrying about things they cannot control.    It's hard, but that's what you need to do. When you feel worried or stressed, breathe deeply - you will realize that you are not breathing properly, and the lack of oxygen makes your brain go into fear mode.

AW1OWmOtaa	Well it is generally recommended that a healthy rate of weight loss is 2lbs per week so as to keep a slow steady loss and help you keep the weight off. Your goal is working out at about 3.6lbs a week so I suppose with hard work it isn't impossible and doesn't sound too dangerous although remember most people will lose the most weight in their first week and it gets harder after that. Try healthy meals at regular intervals and lots of exercise.  Tip:Exercising in the morning before breakfast ensures you burn fat rather than sugar.|`|qwhI0AZXaa	i lost 5 lbs in one week. so yea it is possible.|`|zd052qXMaa	Losing 18 pounds in 5 weeks is unhealthy.  You might be drained and deprived.    5% weight loss of your total weight is the best way to go.|`|NAqfPvmHaa	yes it's possible, but unhealthy. a more realistic goal would be 8-10 pounds!best of luck|`|alAtUXvyaa	that's only like 4 pounds a week, yeah it would be possible|`|Hda1ic24aa	yes, if you poop alot my friend lost a stone by taking a dump so yes   thanks for reading lol|`|I83sYbARaa	Yep,  eat mostly vegatables, and fruit..... look up the 'How to lose 20 pounds in 20 days'   book...  If you do that , you will be also detoxing, so that if you immediately start eating regular 'food'  after that you could become sick... so be careful not to jump right in and eat just anything after doing this  Another way is to go to michael thurmonds site and look up your body type, then he gives the foods you can eat the most of anytime and still lose weight, and stay healthy.....  If you walk at least 30minutes a day and drink 1/2 your body weight in ounces of water.... eg.. if you weigh 120 you should drink 60ounces of water that day, at least....which helps detox, and hydrate  You should find a good EVERY DAY eating plan that works for you so you dont have to go thru this|`|om9PLGecaa	yeah you can loose alot of weight quick but its not healthy|`|SQ39aHSoaa	you'd have to lose 3 to 4 pounds per week, which isn't realistic.  usually 2 pounds per week is healthy so that would mean you'd lose 10 pounds, and you'd go down about one size in clothing. but it's not impossible to lose that amount of weight in 5 weeks but your going to have to be very disciplined with your eating habits and working out.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Try calorie counting but don't go below 1,400 or your body will only hold on to the fat just what you want to avoid! and eat food with no more than 4% fat,combine with regular exercises and the wait will drop off at around 2 pounds a week,i done this and managed to lose 3 and a half stone! good luck.|`|vrfuO9Asaa	jym 24 hrs

Just break open a very large bottle of distilled water near your face, it also takes your breath away. Sulfur dioxide used to keep dried fruit a nice color also does it.  The chemistry is complicated but it has to do with the quick stripping and quick replacement of ions from parts of the air you are breathing.

Y3bZsP2Naa	No.  Many of My known friends relatives etc. Say its useless...    The product just over-exagerates the results...  It Just Makes you sweat..    If you really want to loose weight in ur tummy area, Just Do it the hard way, Work out, Do crunches and you WILL get perfect results!! :)    Because You need to build the muscles! The Fat covers the muscles hence making the person look fat..  Hence, do Crunches regularly, It will build muscles and burn fat and make you look slimer!  Good luck.. :)|`|X9QOHRLFaa	No its **** , its a total waste of yor time and money. I have been scammed by them too. hi i am sorry but the truth is the only way to effectively and permanently loose weight is by working out and eating right , well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.    www.xattack.in|`|9oOFBkR4aa	y dont u try for other practices for Weight loss?|`|TkqRjcT7aa	if u really want to really loose weight do yoga and pranayamam and follow diet for some extent. u'll definitely loose ur weight.don't depend on all these belts they r merely waste.if they r so effective as they advertise doctor's will definitely prescribe that for all the people who r over weight.just think y they r not doing so .|`|5zbT9h8waa	NO, don't buy it, do pranayam
de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	Well, as you know, if you want to put on weights, gaining muscles is the fastest way to do that. So I'm just going to tell you the basic things about working out and you can decide whether or not you should follow my instructions.    So first of all, you need to do cardiovascular exercises every day for at least 30 minutes and you should do it before working out. Cardios such as running, jogging, swimming, rope jumping are great.    Then here comes to the work out part. So basically I just give you a work out generator first and then you can try to use it to generate your workout routine.    http://www.menshealth.co.uk/base/workout...    And you should do the work outs EVERY OTHER DAY to let your body to take a rest, to recover. But when it comes to the day that you don't need to work out, keep in mind that you still need to do cardio. And as for how many sets and reps (repetitions), well it depends on how many times you can lift. If you are already physically strong, you may want to add more weight when you are lifting. Basically you should at least do 3 sets in every work out, and have a determined reps in it. When you are tired of the sets and reps, you can always add more weight or increase the sets and reps as much as you want. But don't overdo it.    And if you have soreness after the first day working out, it is completely normal. It means that you've never used that part of your body and the work outs you do made it tensed. So don't worry if you are gonna have this situation. Just leave your body for a rest and you will be fine.    And as for what to eat. Well every kind of food with high PROTEIN helps. Those foods are milk, eggs; fishes like tuna or any other kinds of fishes; and lean meat like chicken, turkey; and vegetables like nuts, every kind of nuts. Or like you may notice that there's a product for working out called WHEY PROTEIN SHAKE, and this is actually really helpful for people who work out and try to have big muscles (bulk up). And remember that you should have your meal and drink the whey protein shake right after your work out is over. And remember to get enough sleep, and drink at least 8 glasses of water to hydrate your body, and keep doing your workout routine.      Well I think it's pretty much it and yeah this is a very long journey and sorry for spending your time in reading this.    So just keep doing it and you'll get there.    All the best to you!|`|tIldpr7vaa	well if u put on weight it will either be muscle or fat, which one do u want??    and if u want muscle u have to work out for that, and eat lots of healthy protein rich foods, and work out with heavy weights|`|5sIPEujsaa	put on at least 30lbs of fat from fast food and fried food,wont kill you. then work out after that.should def work.|`|bIxZiOaxaa	weight training but you'll have to balance it out
3v5MQ8ciaa	Another diabetic a little older than him, probaly a male or someone he looks up to. Perhaps it's time to explain to him the complications if he doesn't look after himself. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in young adults in Australia. Ask his doctor for videos or media material that he will be interested to look at. Don't force him, or yell at him, just talk to him like an adult (even though he isn't yet). tell him the facts but offer him support also.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Yes, it sounds like you're going to have to take more control, or at least do more supervision.  Part of this is that he's a kid, trying to be normal like the other kids.  Most of us went through a few years of that attitude before we started kicking into gear, so try not to stress out too much about it.  Talking to him about complications is pointless at his age...teenagers are invincible and immortal, remember?  ; )    Try continuing to let him bolus himself, but have him calculate his carbs with you and tell you how much he should be giving himself, then correct him only if he's significantly off.  And watch him while he does it.  Make sure he knows that testing before and after each meal is a requirement, not an option.  He will need to earn his independence.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	You need to talk to your endocrinologist about this.  He/she may be able to offer you some kind of advice.  For now I think you need to take control.  Remind him to bolus then watch him do it.  Remind him to test his sugars then wait and watch him do it.  Hopefully, he'll get back into good habits.  Perhaps you can make up some kind of reward system.  If he tests his sugar before you remind him put a star on his daily log, if he boluses before you remind him put a star on the chart.  Offer rewards for 5 stars and 10 stars etc.  Perhaps something like McDonald's for dinner with 5 stars or a new video game after 20 stars and so on.  Whatever motivates your son.  I did this with my son who is 16 now.  He was diagnosed at age 7 too.    If this doesn't work you may have to try punishing him for neglecting his responsibilities.  I just had a conversation about this with my son's diabetes specialist because Harry had started to neglect testing his sugar and wasn't writing the info down.  We had a long talk (me, my son and the doc) about what was expected and what would happen if he didn't do what he needed to.  After he saw I was serious and I took his XBox away he snapped right back into his good habits.    Also, I found that my son became much more  responsible in his diabetes habits after attending diabetes camp in the summer.  Has your son ever gone?  Check out www.setebaid.com for info on their summer camp.  I think they also have preteen weekend programs.  Also, check out www.childrenwithdiabetes.com - that site has a wealth of information including camps and much much more.  Check with you endocrinologist about support groups, there are some groups for parents to share stories and ideas and it's great to talk with someone who understands your issues.  Consider getting involved with JDRF activities.  My family goes to their events and we volunteer our time. It feels good to help find a cure and it's great to meet others who  have family members with diabetes.  Email me if I can help any more.  And perhaps I can have my son talk to yours if you think it may help?  I'm assuming he'd help, but ofcourse I'd have to ask him first.      Wow!  Allen13 sure doesn't know what type 1 diabetes is!!  Feeding you kid a raw diet won't help him bolus up as needed!|`|ZsCqfPaZaa	Perhaps contact your local ER and ask them if you can show him what happens when his glucose gets too high.  Or, even better, contact a dialysis center and let him see the patients that have to travel to their facility every other day.  Let him see the damage done to their arms and the giant rubber shunts placed in various places of their bodies once their veins have been ruined by all the treatments.  Let him know that this is very serious and that he could potentially die from neglecting his health for even a little bit.|`|gNBKvQuMaa	Maybe your being to forceful in your approach...maybe your intensity is to negative...Have you ever considered an ALTERNATIVE to this "so called disease"? It IS reversible!! You will NOT find these answers in a "normal" medical center...Your doctors are educated in DRUGS and SURGERIES nothing else. Not unless they decided to get outside nutritional education, its just NOT mandatory.I'm sure you may be thinking I am making this up but look in mans past, its right there.Our health is in crisis because of what we eat and what we do not eat.Chemicals/additives are all over processed foods and well its very very interesting to me that all the regular"real" doctors I have taken my kids to and myself will NOT test our VITAMIN and MINERAL levels when they CAN!! Insurance will NOT pay for it.All these diseases everyone is afraid of and think are sooooo bad and dangerous fail to see the big picture.OUR FOOD CHOICES! Only since chemicals and many GMO products have been introduced and new ones every week for several years now has the health in America and elsewhere skyrocketed.DETOX is what you all NEED.You maybe crying to your child about the horror but he doesn't see the big deal because you are not him and he may not be feeling any different.Get rid of of the processed foods, go raw and organic and local as much as possible,question everything I say, everything your normalcy says.Full presence NEVER repeats History and darlin, america has been repeating this same damn rerun since my wonder years...Pasteurized dairy is BAD for the body, SOY is BAD for the body, fermenting and not high temperature cooking is best and if your SOY is tofu, vegetable oil,margerine etc...its GMO!!Processed salts and sugars are soooo unbelievably unhealthy and I am thinking your son is feeling alienated, he is the only that has to go through this crap, might you be so considerate to put yourself through what he has to do or what you say and require him to do???If you should choose to keep at this lifestyle he will always have diabetes and he will likely hate himself for it, I did and many in my family still do because they would rather be the victom then ever try something different even though they cry to be healthy they would rather eat crap and be miserable, I might add that GMO SOY does inflict VERY POOR ATTITUDES in KIDS of all ages, this is why sooooo many kids have this same attitude everywhere you go, my eldest is exactly this way and she and he father will not change their diets, they think they can live forever and eat and drink as they wish...Did you know that High Fructose Corn Syrup is a GMO and its been proven to have MERCURY in its processing?? They've KNOWN since 2005.Any idea what kind of health damage this causes??I could go on and on but I am sure you are likely in a bit of denial at this point if not completely PO'd...I do not mean to offend I just want to help and NO one can save you or another from you if you won't allow it and my apologies if any of this comes across rude that is not my intention, I have been through hell with my own health and my girls and the lies are far greater then you might imagine.I hope you can seek outside your bubbled life and really see whats going on in the US today, none of this has just happened to you or me...We all have dropped the ball and let go of our responsibilities in all this but its never to late to do different and get a great turn around in the process.I will help you get linked to scientific research and the Health Journals etc, specialists,MD's and Nutritionists should you desire to know more.What we believe is what we will receive, be very careful what you believe in, there ARE consequences even if you've been ignorant to the whole thing...I was and will never be again!|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Teach him about dialysis.|`|AA11791967	i was the same way when I was young.

If you tried to "shave" them, you'll damage the nerves that are in your teeth, and that will make them sensitive.

wq4yfxaGaa	I wouldn't say it was PMS, I'd just say it was puberty.  Your body's hormones are constantly changing which happens during puberty along with the hair growth and other things.|`|iYSYLUa1aa	Yes!   Do you just wanna eat choclate all day and sleep   then yep
B8sJEBxTaa	You should at least wait around 3-4 hours before taking another Tylenol. Since you just took 2 about an hour ago, I'd wait for at least 2 more hours, but 3 in one day seems like a lot anyways.|`|jlQHB9dvaa	The maximum dose of tylenol per day is 4 grams or 4000 milligrams.  That would be 8 extra strength tablets per day.  The risk of liver damage increases with higher doses used long term.  If you're sick, I would hold off on the workout.  Your body is already stressed by trying to fight off whatever it has.  Give it a break until you feel better.
KkmEUe1qaa	the longer your movements are, the healthier you are. i saw this question on oprah actually. the doctor said when you have movements that are long and "s" shaped, it means it's the same shape as your intestins.|`|tIldpr7vaa	its healthier, it means u dont have a bunch of poop crusted up in ur system, gross but true
phQOujuFaa	The diet is not too bad actually-vegetarian, yes.  Healthy cereal, low fat yogurt, cheese, veggies, and fruit is a good way to go.  As long as she incorporates things like beans and avocado for protein she should be okay.  These items don't keep you full for long though.  If "she" over eats, even on healthy food, it will not work.  "She" should probably eat 6 small meals a day on this diet.      It sounds like the activity level is good and has a decent head on her shoulders.  If she/you stick to the diet and workout routine the weight should drop.  Without knowing age, weight, etc...it is hard to determine how much to lose.  1-2 pounds per weeks is healthy.|`|158d8ca204794d0e55a944b476cb170eaa	This diet could work perfectly but maybe not enough to lose fat sufficiently. You did not mention bodybuilding or free exercises to reinforce your muscle. Finally because of the amount of vitamins and capacities knwon for helping in losing weight, the acai berry juice could be added to the diet. And let come the results!|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	you see, we can't help you because your question is not specific.   It's  a lacto-vegetarian diet, but we can't tell you if your sister   (or is it you?) will lose weight. It depends on portion control. You   can eat a bucket of low-fat cheese and gain weight. People usually   confuse healthy eating with weight loss diet. What she proposes,   it's healthy eating. To turn it to a weight loss diet, she must start   counting her caloric intake. Because, you know, you can eat one   MacDonalds hamburger a day and lose weight - this will be an   unhealthy weight loss diet.

CbMpae1Haa	These are just some basic tips to help you gain weight. I tell my clients these same steps:    - Track your Calories. You need at least your body-weight in lbs x 20kcal daily to gain weight.    - Set a Goal Weight. A rule of thumb is at least 1kg for each cm above 1m. Anything less youll always look skinny.    - Eat Every 3 Hours.You need at least your body-weight in lbs x 20 kcal to gain weight.    - Eat Calorie Dense Foods. 100g raw rice is 380kcals. 100g raw spinach is only 25kcals. Getting your daily calorie intake is easier if you eat foods high in calories.    - Get Stronger. You want to go from skinny to muscular. Keep doing the strength training. More strength is more muscle. Free weights force you to stabilize the weight and allow for natural motions. Start light, focus on technique and add weight progressively. Compound exercises work your whole body, so: Squats, Deadlifts, Overhead Press, Bench Press, Pull-ups, Dips, Barbell Row, to name a few. Squating 3 times a week is a must! Squats stress your whole body. When you can Squat 1.5x your body-weight for 1 rep, youll no longer be skinny. Rest is also important because your muscles grow when you rest, not when you workout. Dont train daily. Sleep, drink 1 gallon water daily and eat fruits/veggies.    - Eat Your Protein.You need 1g protein per pound of body-weight per day to build & maintain muscle. Since your a vegetarian that's a little harder. Getting 1g/lbs protein daily is easy if youre lacto and/or ovo: eggs, milk, whey, cheese, are some examples.  Other protein sources you can choose from:  - Beans. Black, garbanzo, hummus, kidney, fava, winged, mungo, lima  - Legumes. Lentils, peas, cow peas, chick pea, snow peas  - Nuts. Walnuts, almonds, pistachio, cashew, peanuts, peanut butter  - Seeds. Sesame, pumpkin, hemp, flax  - Milk. Soy milk, almond milk  - Soy. Soy beans, tofu, deli-style soy meats, soy milk, soy cheese (though be careful with eating too much of this)  - Whole Grains. Brown rice, quinoa, granola, oats, breads   - Protein Powder. Soy protein, hemp protein, rice protein    - Track Your Progress. Success breeds success. Knowing that youre losing your skinny look will keep you motivated. Track everything: Calories, your weight, take pictures, track strength gains everything.    This should help you out some to get you stronger and leaner. Sorry for going on and on...hope I helped  Enjoy    J|`|aZXnW6AUaa	beans|`|MEOjwPCNaa	If you aren't vegan, i.e. you can eat dairy products, then whey protein is a good choice to supplement your diet. Try to find a powder which is clean--i.e. doesn't contain more than a couple grams of fat or carbs per serving. Some of these are chock-full of sugar and other nastiness which you don't need, so read the labels! Price does not always correlate to quality.    In order to get a complete protein (all the aminos) from a vegetable source, you will usually need to combine foods. Beans and rice make a complete protein, as do lentils and rice. In fact, lentils are 20% protein by volume and also contain lots of fiber and vitamins. They're a very-overlooked bodybuilding food, in my opinion. Make sure you're eating plain brown rice--not bleached rice or processed Uncle Ben's instant.     Again, if you eat dairy, milk is a great bodybuilding food on its own. It also boosts the protein and vitamin content of whey powder--and improves its texture dramatically compared to water.    BE CAREFUL WITH SOY. It's a very, very tempting food for vegetarians because it's a complete protein, it's cheap, and it's full of vitamins. The problem is that soy contains a chemical called phytoestrogen which appears to imitate estrogen in your body. As a man, you are many times more sensitive to estrogen than a woman. In fact, it's been shown that one serving of soy a day will cut your sperm count in half--so it's reasonable to assume that it has other feminizing effects on your body. Estrogen prevents you from building muscle and encourages your body to store fat--exactly the opposite of what you're trying to accomplish. There's still a debate over exactly what soy does to your hormones, but until it's resolved I would definitely NOT make it a staple of your diet. A little tofu or miso now and then probably won't hurt you, but I would not eat it daily.|`|x7JpsVm6aa	You need to eat protein within 10 minutes of working out, then it gets absorbed as muscle.    If you need suggestions for soy proteins, try looking at this veggie protein guide: http://is.gd/ivwr. Lots of diverse sources for getting it, plus nutritional comparisons.|`|AW1OWmOtaa	Try this protein powder  http://www.juicemaster.com/product.php?i...

Hemp Protein Powder is made from hemp seeds, which have the most complete edible and usable protein in the vegetable kingdom. This high-performance protein powder is easily digestible with 65% globulin edestin and 35% albumin protein - more than any other plant!
wdNfee9Baa	Usually when you want to lose weight as a female you take your total weight..so 115 lbs and multiply it by 10 to get the desired calories that you can only consume to lose weight.  Therefore you should eat about 1150 calories a day combined with exercise to lose 10 pounds in a month or so.  To lose the weight in a healthy manner you are suppose to lose 2 pounds a week.  So only eating 1150 calories plus swimming will def show results for you in a week or so.   Good Luck :)  Side note: As a male you are suppose to multiply your weight by 11..soo 115 lbs by 11 is 1265 and so on.|`|VHrLpbjQaa	GO to www.mypyramid.gov

koAaPXKQaa	I would definately do a wee bit of research yourself as YA is not a reliable source. If you have access to nursing journals then have a look at those to see if you can find anything. Be sure and make a note of it though and put it in you're professional portfolio as reflection! (I'm a student nurse too.)    In the meantime, have a look at the links below, it may be able to help you a little.|`|0ff94ba9320182f79127dc5f55cbcaefaa	Hi - there are a lot of good resources out there, it is just a matter of finding them. Your nursing studies will be something of an asset to you in helping to you to filter through what is useful and what is not!!    GP is an odd one - it differs from person to person. Most cases are idiopathic, some cases resolve as spontaneously as they occurred. I have very severe GP - I cannot tolerate any solid food at all, but I have stabilised my weight on nutritional drinks. I cannot take the medications because of adverse effects and other drug interactions, so I'm a bit stuck. Have you tried different medications? There are a number of different ones available, some with a lot less side effects. There are other treatments available as well. My specialist is currently looking into botox for me - it is injected endoscopically into the pyloric sphincter to relax the sphincter and supposedly promote emptying. Works for some, not others, but I'm thinking that I have to give it a go as my only other option is a J-tube due to how much weight I've lost and how thin I now I am. I'm 5'4 and about 43kg (95lb).    I'm going to have to stop typing now, as I have other problems including issues with my hands, but please feel free to email me if you want.|`|c687ba2c3786d264e3f7a7e6b1a12f8caa	You can also use WebMD and research it...

K7x1RHVFaa	Apply for financial aid if you want to go to college.    Get an old car if you want to save on driving expenses.    Always be looking for a better job to keep you happy with what you are doing for work.    When you feel like God hates you go to a church and offer to help others to see how good that makes you feel knowing that you are that rich that you can do so.    Know that in order to make friends you have to talk to friendly people. Not all people are friendly people but you will meet some friendly people every day.    Try not to think so much about what you are lacking but what you can do next. If you are always busy you tend never to be disappointed in life.    Don't kill yourself as that is a waste of so much potential it is ridiculous.    Smile. Believe me that one is a must.    Laugh. It makes you feel better.    Oh. the world will not be a better place by people killing themselves. It will simply be a world void of people. It will become a wilderness.    Again if you find your self whining, smile, and think what can i do different, like go to a book store and read or go to church and offer your help. Doing anything is better than dwelling about nothing.    As for the temper tantrums, tried controlled breathing and meditation. It helps too.    And if all these tips do not help you, talk to a doctor about how you are feeling and see if they can offer you a new course of action. Get a bllod test and see if you are physically okay, and if you are that is a good thing so smile and see what else the doctor will suggest.    Good Luck.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	You can only control your self. The question is not "why does nothing go my way?" but "why am I not going the right way?" The first question is the plea of a selfish child who expects everything and everyone to cater to her own needs. The second question is the thought of an adult who takes responsibility for her own life.    You are self-centered, stuck in your head, inside your own little world. But the world does not revolve around you. You need to understand that you are just a part of the world, and not everything is personally directed at you.    When you accept this, the world will change before your eyes...

If is it a number one then she may just have a slight infection or irritation that is causing the pain which would require her seeing a doctor as if left untreated it can be very serious, for now tell her to bathe her vulva (external genitals) in warm salt water to ease the pain and help kill off germs. If number two then it just means she has hard stools, there are tablets she can get to soften them and she needs to eat a better diet, but there is no urgency to see a doctor, but she maybe should tell her mom. Tell her NEVER put vasline in or on her vagina or vulva as it will trap dirt and bacteria around her vagina and vulva causing infections.|`|kFECmFGLaa	it could be a UTI you need to tell her mom so she can go to the Dr.|`|exh2uAlEaa	it can't stop, i mean she can sooth herself by bathing in hot water mixed with a touch of corn startch, or to kill some of the bacteria use saltwater.

boUAqkRiaa	I have been trying to lose weight for over 5 years now.  I have tried every quick fix, and fad diet that is out there, and I if I did lose weight I did not stick to it for very long and in the end I always gained it back and then some.  I decided to finally try a healthy approach, eat less fat and calories and add exercise.  I am now in my second week (which is pretty good for me since I have no will power) and I am steadily losing weight.  I have learned to realize that losing a bunch of weight in a short period of time is not going to help it will only hurt.  Plus if you are very over weight (50lbs. and up) and you lose alot of weight in a short period of time you will be left with lose skin and really who wants that.  You are just a head to do it the right way once in for all.  Stop looking for a quick fix.|`|phQOujuFaa	People want a quick fix because they think losing the weight will solve problems.

The pressure can  be so over whelming at time to be a certain body type that it can cause serious physiological damage, like bulimia and anorexia. I have noticed that older people (40's and above) of average or below average income think more of being healthy than worrying about 'what others think'. And older people of above average income that attend functions or are in the public tend to have the money to spend on looking younger, slimmer and go for plastic surgery more than other income brackets.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	In respects to Mr. Angry, its not that way all the time. There are a lot of cases where the person diets and exercises beyond belief and still doesnt lose any weight. A lot comes from genetics.

8SPRJUHIaa	Hi!    Doing chest exercises can help.  Reason being your major chest muscles support your breasts and they need to be strong enough to hold them up.  Your breasts are largely fat and connective tissue so you are not firming or toning your breasts with the exercises, you are strengthening your peck muscles to support them.  There are a couple web addresses below with some info for you.  You can also look up exercises for your pecks.  There are things you can do at home or at the gym.  Simplest of which is push-ups.  There are exercises you can use free weights with and there are exercises using resistance tubing as well.  Remember to pay attention to your form (body positioning) when doing exercises to get the greatest benefit for your effort as well as avoiding injury.    As well if your breasts are allowed to sag this stretches out the connective tissues and skin, so wearing good supportive bras are important.    If you keep your peck muscles strong and your breast well supported this will go a long way to keep them looking nice well throughout your life.    Best of luck.|`|knciqpxTaa	Bras can help prevent the appearance of sagging while you wear them, however some studies have found that wearing bras actually causes the ligaments and pectoral muscles to atrophy, and increases breast sagging. Just like if you immobilize any part of your body, it will become weaker (use it or lose it).    The best bet is to not worry so much about it, unless you make a living on showing your bare breasts, then nobody will notice or care. It happens to us all.|`|fOZPJhoPaa	The best things for you to do are toning exercises to help keep the firm and to wear supportive bras (make sure you get a properly fitted bra by being professionally measured), I know these aren't always attractive but they are important for the more well endowed as they help keep them up-lifted and to help prevent back and shoulder pain which can be a problem with larger breasts.  Check out backcountry.com  bravissimo.com|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	Do you mean 36F?  I feel the same as you  I'm a 32F at 15 and still growing and mine are starting to sag a bit.  I've found that since wearing a bra to bed it helps slow the sagging process and you can get cream which firm them up but i'm not sure if these do work.  There are exercises you can do aswell.|`|5zVZaQrQaa	if you weren't so cocky I'd probably say something useful.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	Outside of a "lift" there is nothing you can do to change what they look like right now, however, to prevent it from worsening, it would be in your highest interest to go and get fitted with a GOOD bra by someone who is trained to do this.  Keep those girls where they need to be so they aren't hanging to your knees by the time you reach 40.  Child birth will be another challenge for you.  Big breasts can be wonderful, but they come with their own "cons" as well.|`|HQ3aNEk5aa	You can get a push up bra. They work wonders and make you look cool.  Breast reduction is not needed. Skin elasticity is rare and not really possible in your case.  You were exactly like me. I was a 36C at 10. I had real trouble stopping them sagging, but as I said a push up bra is great.  Sagging is quite natural if the boobs are large enough. The only option to STOP it is to have surgery (Not needed!!!) but there are loads of things you can try to make it look better.      Hope I helped.
b8yhcxmRaa	I am going to give her doctor the benefit of the doubt, as they are most aware of her condition. I just hope they are up to date on research.    To their defense as well, most of vegetables and fruits are either waxed, treated, or been sprayed by insectisides (which btw can cause cancer). Unless your friend can buy organic fresh produce that have not been manipulated somehow, then her doctor believes she is better off playing it safe and peel her veggies/fruits.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	If it is colon cancer, I could understand why she was told that.

My BIL (a colon cancer survivor) was told something similar.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Well, this is news to me. I do choose to eat mostly organic produce, and now (as well as during chemo) I scrub it thoroughly. Anything I couldn't scrub during chemo, I didn't eat. That should make the risk of infection for bacteria pretty low.    The only other thing the doc could be thinking is that peels and seeds often contain high levels of antioxidants. Some chemo and radiation work on the principle of actually creating free radicals to fight cancer cells ... so antioxidants would be counterproductive to this effort. Still, none of my doctors went so far as to recommend avoiding dietary consumption of antioxidants, only concentrated supplements.    The communication breakdown would be that your survivor friend didn't ask, "Um, why is that?"|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Yes   -But peeling will remove some vitamins ,you should make alternative arrangements  -to get them.  -My relative software engineer doesnt have cancer ,but removes seeds of  capsicum before cooking  -Apple seeds even  if you dont have cancer ,you should not eat-ask with doctor why  -Even New Delhi television announced not to eat capsicum seeds for healthy people  -You can write e mails to me  -If you write to us the e mail address of that doctor we can also praise that doctor for his precaution|`|6mSfRjpxaa	I have had many friends and relatives who have had cancer and nobody ever mentioned this.

I will even go as far as to say that the opposite is the way to survival.    The seeds which do contain tiny amounts of cyanogenic glycosides are actually extremely benefitial to the cancer sufferers and the peels do have the most of vitamins, antioxidants and other benefitial bio-force chemicals.    In the chance of buying the fruit and veggies from source which does not guarantee that they were produced organically and in human friendly environment(very important for any cancer patient), you must use an ultrasound and special wash to get rid of all pollutants (the chemicals unfriendly to our health).

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Bleeding after sex doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong, if it's happened more than once then it may still be nothing but mention it to a doctor to rule out anything serious. Light bleeding is normally caused by friction as your partners penis moves, this causes swelling and small splits in your vaginal walls, it's easily prevented by more foreplay before penetration or using lubrication on days where hormonal changes leave you a little dry...or when you're going at it like bunnies and your natural lubrication dries up. Lubrication is as important to safe sex as condoms so be lube-smart as some may damage condoms (oil-based) or toys (silicone based), know what lubes are best for what sexual activity and have fun trying different types to see which are best. Another common cause of light bleeding is damage from toys or your partners fingers so also make sure your partner trims their nails and check toys for any seams with rough edges.     Heavy bleeding would scare any woman or simply make you think your period has come early, well early period is one obvious cause, otherwise the most probable cause is an injury to your vagina or cervix while thrusting, if he was going at it too hard and you were not well lubricated, if you suffer from vaginismus then this is a probable cause. Increased bleeding does not necessarily mean something more serious, it's still more than likely down to vaginal damage from a lack of lubrication or you both going at it too hard and rough for too long. Other possible causes are birth control methods such as IUD's or diaphragms irritating your cervix, if you use these methods and feel discomfort then discuss different options with your doctor. There can be problems with your vagina itself including polyps on your cervix or vaginal infections and STI's so if reoccuring see a doctor to rule these problems out.|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	the lesbian is too big.|`|FOeWqr0qaa	that you're a virgin or the guy's private is big.

Some causes of vaginal bleeding after sex, such as vaginal dryness after menopause, are not serious and may be easily treated.

He told me it was because I was growing, and when i stand up after lying down for a long time, all the blood rushes to my feet to try and even things out because my circulation can't keep up with how fast i am growing. i dont know if this is the same thing, but he told me to sit up in bed for a few seconds before getting up. try it and see if it helps, good luck|`|dmznRvjEaa	youre not crazy, its happened to me too. im pretty sure when babies sleep on their backs and they throw their arms and legs out, they feel as though theyre falling too! my son does it all the time.
Gew6pZhbaa	I've tried it. It's hard to do, so start small. I started by only eating healthy foods after 7:00, like yogurt, granola, fruits, and water, and not eating after 9:00. Then after a week, I wouldn't eat after 8:00. Now, I don't eat after 7:00, and it's become easy to do. You just have to slowly do it, and get your body used to not having food after a certain time. And yes, it works very well! Good luck!|`|VtkfvQaZaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the one thing that definitely worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was reported in Fox News and CNN. I worked off 25 pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|SXZfntmUaa	I never heard of this but if you have a regular routine it is good. eating every day at a similar time is good for your body because then your body will know when your gonna eat .   chocolate is fine, your not having too much so you have a good diet =]. drink plenty of water thou.  i usually eat after 7|`|d9K5Utgdaa	it does work..im 16 and i go out everyday wit my b.f and we eat at 10pm and were getting fattt so maybe if u dont eat after 5/6pm it will worr...good luck|`|1nMkURyPaa	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5YTWIfFdaa	i always eat after 7pm, but it is best to try and avoid carbs after 7pm. cos by that time of night your not going to burn them off|`|zd052qXMaa	Actually, it's no eating after 6.

LQpU6Zd8aa	I have taken it and yes it helps with anxiety. but you also should plan to bring something to occupy yourself because the drug helps with anxiety but it doesn't help much it you obsess about the flight.    I used to have major anxiety attacks and like you needed to get somewhere in a hurry but had a big problem with flying. After the atavan (brand name for what you are taking) took effect, which was about 30 minutes I was calm enough to get on the plane. One thing I found helpful was doing deep breathing before, during and after boarding. And I kept a sort of dialog going in my mind to keep me calm.  I have included a site below which explains the med also will look for a site about flying and anxiety.  Best of luck and I hope your Gran is better.|`|ycNt74yyaa	Oh sweetie plz don't take that med. It will damage your liver. You'll be fine on the plane.     Bring chewing gum and other snacks to help distract yourself and also to help with the pressure in your ears. I got VERY scared when I felt the pressure but it's became tolerable when I chewed some gum and yawned a lot. Try to get a window seat, it's quite lovely to see the clouds and pretty scenery. If you don't feel comfortable with looking then ask for an aisle seat, explaining your fear. Everyone will be quite accommodating and perhaps say a few reassuring things.     You have a higher chance of getting in an accident when driving, by the way so the stress you're feeling is quite unjustified. Bring the medication with you if it will make you feel better knowing you can take it if you need to but remember it might not be the magic bullet.     By the way, you seem like a high anxiety person in general because you're typing all in Caps as if you're yelling and it's the end of the world.     I hope your gran will be ok. Good luck.|`|eEjV0z0Vaa	Lorazepam has strong sedative/hypnotic effects, and is most commonly used for short-term management of severe anxiety.  You'll be so knocked out you won't feel anxious.  Warning - do NOT drink alcohol or take other Benzodiazepines such as Valium or Alprazolam.    I recommend that in addition to Lorazepam, you learn some breathing exercises and do deep breathing.  I do this at the dentist and have hypnotized myself to a point where I am unaware of drilling.  Here's a website about stress and anxiety that talks about yoga for anxiety: http://www.alprazolam.org/natural-cures/...|`|1EwbKkKCaa	I have never taken it before but heard it does work. I had a friend who had a phobia about like everything (I think that is what they gave her) and it worked for some of the phobias. And when you are on the plane just try reminding yourself its for your granny is sick and that she wants you there with her. Try to imagine yourself in another place. Sounds silly but hey its worth a try.
LPtUJ5p5aa	It certainly is yes.    THC is the chemical compound that gets you "high". This chemical is tranmitted through the smoke, whether inhaled or not, though it would probably take quite a bit for you to actually get high from.    Most people refer to it as a "contact high".|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Yes, you can get a contact high.|`|QLMW7HRMaa	Yes, and test positive during drug testing.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	It is 110 percent possible, I once actually failed a drug test because my boyfriend got high in my car one day when we were driving around.

tIldpr7vaa	stay away from simple carbs ( breads, pasta,etc..) and all sugars, and do lots and lots of cardio    look int the Keto diet    and of course to ab exercises to make ur abs bigger, but this wont burn stomach fat, just for muscle building|`|VB76LCmSaa	the best way to get a six pack is to target upper abs one day, and lower abs the next.  for instance: crunches and twists (with you right leg up and left leg straight, put your hands behind your head and twist so that your elbows almost touch the knee, then switch legs every set) monday, then on tuesday do reverse crunches, or hanging crunches, or leg raises, which ever ones you like best, don't work your obliques this day.  then Wednesday do mondays workout, and thursday tuesdays workout all through the week, skip sunday.  as a goal try to be able to do 5 sets of 25 repetitions.  as for dieting, your not trying to build much mass in your abs so you don't need very much protein, just a low carbohydrate type diet.      Buon Fortuno!    Bruno Talina|`|P7ExWMp9aa	Essentially, if you want to obtain abs you have to have a low enough body fat. No this doesn't mean you should do 5 million crunches. The only way you will gain a six-pack is by lowering your body fat. To do this you must do cardio and eat right. You can still do simple exercises like crunches and sit ups. Diet wise you want to keep your carb, sodium, and fat intake low.    I would visit bodybuilding.com for more information. Don't be intimidated by the name. It has information for a whole range of people, not just bodybuilders.
c85faeebb94f70edb6993c9354121ea7aa	Yes.  I took methamphetamine for about 6 months and it caused me a psychotic episode.

I didn't act any different around my dad, I cried, and grieved but alone. Not saying you should do the same. I cherished every moment with my dad like it was the last.

I lost my mother to cancer in 2006.  I remember when they said it was terminal.  They had given her til spring of '07, but instead she died 3 days before Christmas.    Even if they gave her a timeframe, you still cannot predict any more than with yourself or anyone else you know.  She could die tomorrow in a car crash instead of in 6 months of cancer.    It wouldn't be a bad idea to get the affairs in order, for just in case... but as for how to act around her... just love her as much as you always have.  Cherish each moment, and have fun.  Laugh and play games (my mother and I loved to play Scrabble; we were masters!) and appreciate her.    Try talking to her about how she feels about it... but don't push her if she doesn't want to.  She probably needs to come to terms with it as much as you do.    Keep trying... help her try to keep  her strength up, eat lots of vegetables and fruits... stuff like that.  The doctor should have more information on ways to do that.    Again, I'm really sorry you got that news; I know how you feel.    Tell her you love her as much as you can.|`|AA10797456	I understand how and what you are feeling.  My sister was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer in July and I lost her 4/20.  The strange thing is that the doctor never came out and said you are going to die.  They told me when they said she had Pancreatic Cancer.  The drs said "we do not have a crystal ball"  I think she knew, but she always said she was feeling better.  I  did as much as possible with her when she was feeling ok.  Tell her you love her and make new memories.  Let her yell, scream and cry when she wants to... just be there for her and tell her she is the BEST mom in the world.  You will know when the right time is to "get the affairs in order"  Things just seem to fall into place.   Please keep us posted with how YOU are doing.  This is a very hard time for the survivors.
k3qKIXQ9aa	To answer your quesion, Yes, If you use methadone for pain relief some doctors will give you methadone (most likely if your pain is more severe, because methadone is a very potent opiate)... But if you are using it to come off another drug (as I assume you are, because you said 'clinic') then no, there isn't really any other [legal] way.    BUT listen... instead of using methadone i strongly suggest you switch to Suboxone (buprenorphine), this medication is also used to come off drugs, and you can go to a specialist and get the medication through your insurance. (Suboxone is all over a MUCH better, more effective, SAFER medication than methadone)|`|3v59cDWfaa	This question is insane. And I wonder if the DEA watchdogs do stuff like thiis. I am reporting it.|`|ZgpS1WNXaa	Please don't go there! Trying to go the easy and cheap way means that other people could try to take advantage of you and get you hooked again, or give you fake methadone.      You can get help in dealing with your addiction, but it means involving the medical profession, such as an addictions counseling center.  I don't know what your medical options are, but going into rehab is a good way to safely deal with your addiction issues.    Good luck,  All the best in your attempts to get clean.

ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	You will lose weight, but you need to up your lean protein a bit.  Have a yogurt along with your piece of fruit at breakfast and put some lean chicken or tuna on your salad at lunch.  If you don't eat enough protein, you will get hungry faster and that can cause the binges.  How much do you want to weigh?  Take that number and multiply it by 10 and that is how many calories you should eat a day.  (EX. 120 lbs. X 10=1200 calories a day).  Any less than that and your body will think it is being starved and hold onto every calorie and fat gram you ingest and you won't lose.  Also, eat several small meals a day.  If you want, have the yogurt for breakfast, the piece of fruit mid morning, your salad with some lean protein at lunch, another piece of fruit or yogurt mid afternoon and then your dinner.  If you get a bit hungry after dinner have some veggies to crunch on.|`|0R5HYKyOaa	umm.......i think so just exercise everyday!!and eat healthy food!|`|n49caa5Vaa	bulumia works. i mean u still get to eat u just throw up a little and the weight drops of u :D   mayb u might not wanna do this cos its a bit unhealthy though. good luck with ur dieting regrdless!!!   bye xx|`|F3WjMOgOaa	your weight loss will be slow, but it will be healthy and will therefore probably stick.  However, remember that muscle mass weighs more than fat, so even if your clothes are getting loser, your weight may not be going down.  don't let this discourage you!!    Make sure you get nutrients.  It is better when dieting to eat 6 small meals rather than 3 larger ones.  So, if you hungry and need a mid-afternoon snack--get one!  Just make it healthy.  A home-made fruit salad, nuts, raw veges always make a good snack, they are sometimes hard to eat, so they fill you up fast.  Celery has negative calories, and lots of good stuff (meaning it takes more to eat than it contains).|`|e158WyFGaa	Weight Watchers worked for me + working out,|`|3d1XRIzkaa	If you want to lose weight, first stop drinking soda pop, even diet soda pop. Instead, start drinking water.  For breakfast, eat a bowl of Special K or Cheerios, with Skim Milk.  For Lunch, eat a turkey sandwich with Fat Free cheese, or a Salad.  For your dinner, eat some type of lean meat, a vegetable, and some type of pasta salad.  Between meals, if you get hungry, eat some dry cereal, and drink lots of water.|`|SUR1MHqWaa	Me too its awful - good luck|`|AA11878029	that's a great healthy diet...you should definitely lose weight|`|SJoGjd78aa	First: Fast weight loss composes of a multi-faceted technique that consists mindset, exercise, and in other cases, diet supplements.  Begin by learning a diet food plan that can easily be accustomed with.  Incorporate an exercise plan that allows even at least fifteen minutes a day like brisk walking, running, swimming, and dancing.    Second: Set realistic approaches.  The ability to focus and have proper mindset enables someone on a diet to quickly lose those extra pounds. With discipline and proper mind set, a dieter will never be discouraged and lose focus.     Third: Listen as the body speaks.  Each and everyone's body metabolism reacts differently to different fast weight loss programs and plans.  Try substituting one program for another to compensate the body's reaction.  Exercise program must be suitable to one's body, as others are not able to exercise as rigorously as others can.  If walking is all that can be done, then walk for this is proven the best exercise.  Muscles burn more calories than fats so it's also best to put on a little muscle and looking good too.    Fourth: Eat more fibers for it makes a person full sooner and stays in the tummy longer, slowing down the rate of digestion.  A single serving of whole grain bread moves fat through the digestive system faster.  Grains turn into blood sugar that spikes the body's insulin level.  Thus, making the body more energized and ready to tell the body when it should stop burning fats or start storing.    Fifth: Keep away from fried foods especially deep-fried as this contains a great amount of fat.  Although fish and chicken appear leaner than beef, this white meat can contain more fat than when a beef is fried.  It is recommended for those on strict diet to opt for grilled food as this does not have or contain less amount of fat after the food is cooked.    Sixth: Takes lots of fluid.  Drinking at least six to eight glasses of water a day keeps the body refreshed.  Since weight loss depends on how the body eliminates body wastes, the body must stay hydrated.    All in all, discipline and consistency is still the best practice and the key to a rapid weight loss success.  Light dieting, workout, and right amount of supplementation applied in a regular way everyday will result in faster weight loss than having a massive action only to be followed a return to old habits as this would only lead to gaining more weight than when the weight loss plan has started.
1dG0XlWNaa	Good for you, for asking!! It's a good start toward feeling better all the time.  "I'm tired" has a good point.   You said "in control" and that's part of the situation: You giving The Other Person answers puts you "on top," or it can seem that way.  When you hear sad stories, you feel needed, entirely natural.  Probably for every human, it's nice to hear someone else has trouble, because their lives look so good on the outside. Not everyone is aware of this feeling, or willing to admit it. And Youi Admitted It!! Hooray for you, srsly.  "Anxious, scared, depressed"  This is no way to be living. Rational Emotive Therapy is useful.

This takes a lot of time. It's impossible to add more than a few pounds of lean muscle a year without taking steroids. On that note, DO NOT take steroids, or anything resembling them (even the legal stuff) especially at your age--you can mess up your endocrine system for life. Had to get that out of the way.    You're still in puberty, so your body is still expending a lot of its resources on your growth and development--which doesn't leave much for muscle development. It's not unhealthy to lift at your age,  just less productive. Stick with it, get into the right habits now and when you're an adult you will see some results. I promise.    The most important part of a routine is changing it often. Your body will eventually adapt to whatever you're making it do, and when your muscles aren't challenged anymore they won't grow anymore. You have to shock it into growing with new exercises, heavier weights, lighter weights with more reps, drop sets, 4x6's...anything to change it up.    Your diet is important. More important than your lifting, actually--diet and rest are what make you grow, the lifting is just the stimulus. Shoot for a minimum of 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight, per day. More if you can. Try to get most of that protein from food, but supplement with a good whey powder if you need to. Good carbs are essential to fuel your workouts--you want to be eating oatmeal, brown rice, etc.    Good luck. Don't give up.|`|WOL61Dqkaa	do sit ups and run at least like everyday and do the sit-ups and push ups too.
qnD5RfbPaa	What ever diet you are on, the 4 basic nutrients are very important for proper health and metabolism.  What ever method you use for weight loss should be that of which you can stick to in order to keep the weight off.  Hence rather than depriving yourself of some essential foods, it is better eating less of those foods.  Eating balanced means, eating foods from all the food groups in proper balance in order to maintain good health and normal weight.    While some argue that digestible carbohydrates are not necessary since energy is also obtained from proteins, and fats, they fail to recognize that the brain does not metabolize proteins and fats and so needs carbohydrates for energy.    So you might be saying that carbohydrate is fattening since it carries a lot of calories.  The answer to that is, not all carbohydrates caries a lot of calories.  As a matter of fact, those that carries less calories keeps you filled longer.  These are complex carbohydrates such as yams, potatoes, cassavas, green banana, pumpkin, etc.  These also carry a certain amount of fibers as well as nutrients essential for proper functioning of all your organs and the proper digestion and utilization of other nutrients.  Simple carbohydrates on the other hand, carries a lot of calories and nothing else.  These you should keep away from.  These would include pastries, sweets, pastas, breads etc.  You diet should be approximately 10% starchy complex carbohydrate.      Proteins are also essential for the building of muscle.  You would like your fats to be converted to muscle as well as otherwise utilized.  For this to happen other nutrients are involved to aid in proper metabolism.  The thing about protein metabolism is that it takes a lot of energy to do so.  Hence some of your fats will be utilized in this process.  Proteins such as meats, fish and other sea foods, egg, milk, and other dairy products, nuts, seeds, grains, peas and beans are very important in your diet.  Approximately 10% of your diet should be that of proteins.    Vitamins are very important for your health and for the braking down and utilization of minerals and vise verse.  Water soluble vitamins are mainly obtained from fruits.  These you should be eating a very wide variety of.  It is very important to eat all kinds of fruits available to you.  Along with the valued vitamins found in fruits they are mainly fiber, water and relatively low in calories.  Fruits should make up approximately 20% of your diet.    The next 60% of your diet should be of vegetables. Approximately 50% of that should be eaten raw.  No doubt you are aware of the high fiber content of vegetables. However most of your fat soluble vitamins as well as some of your minerals are found in vegetables.  You should be eating all kinds of vegetables that you get your hands on - be it celery, parsley, carrots, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, beet, turnip, tomatoes etc., all vegetables contain different nutrients that are essential for good health.    It is also important that you do not strip away all the fats from your proteins.  This is because fats are important for the production of hormones including those necessary for metabolism.    There is one other thing you should not forget - water.  Water is very important for keeping you filled and for the movement of bulk though your intestinal system.     It is very important that you eat a very wide variety of foods - fruits, vegetables, complex starchy carbohydrates and proteins.  By doing so there is no way you will be increasing in weight since you will not be routinely eating the same thing every day.  And by drinking 8 - 10 glasses of water per day, this will help to keep you filled.  Also you need to exercise - even if it takes the form of brisk walking each day.    Pure vegetables move through the digestive system faster and will make you hungry faster, especially if you have suddenly switched from another kind of diet to pure vegetables.  Proteins, fats, and complex carbohydrates are what will keep you feeling full longer because they take longer to digest and move through your digestive system.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|R75tldc8aa	Eat a salad before yours meals.

When I say cabbage, I mean a simple head cabbage, you know, the one which is round and big?    Cucumbers are actually appetite enhancers, and they consist mainly of water, so they are not filling.  The others may be: raw carrots sweet, carrots blanched, stewed.   Broccoli, stewed. Broccoli soup.  Raw tomatoes. Iceberg lettuce with a bit of a vegetable oil.  Bad news: these diet will make you very gassy (will give you flatulence).  Good news: people who are cabbage soup and stewed cabbage reported never feeling any hunger.  Better news: as your body got used to it, you will be less flatulent. But still will be - all that fiber!|`|RZQTV1UEaa	You should be eating a minimum of 20 carbs per day. Most should be coming from veggies. Good ones (lower glycemic index) are kale; red, green, orange and yellow peppers; lettuces, such as Romaine; broccoli, spinach, artichokes, asparagus, brussels sprouts, bok choy, cabbage, eggplant, cauliflower, dandelion greens, swiss chard, green beans, jicama, leeks, mushrooms okra, squash, onions and carrots. Go easy on the onions and carrots, though, they are higher on the glycemic index.|`|ds9Wzw7Saa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se to lose weight, the sole diet that clearly delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it was featured in Fox News and CNN.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	There is nothing at all gross about menstruation, menstrual flow isnt toxic waste and your vagina is the cleanest part of your whole body.    Dont be scared of leaking in the shower as it will just come out of your body and the shower will wash it away. When you have your period very little blood is lost, only around 2-3 tablespoons and it isnt a constant flow so chances are very little blood will come out of your vagina while showering, what is will just go down the drain. You see a lot of blood in the toilet because your urine washes the blood and menstrual material from your vulva (external genitals) into the toilet so it looks like there is much more than there is as the urine dilutes it making it seem more.     During your periods you just shower as you do normally, you need to shower daily to keep yourself clean not just because of your periods but because youre human so you sweat and get dirty. If the blood leaks out of your body then just wash it away, its not a big deal, when youre older you may want to use internal menstrual products like tampons, menstrual cups, softcups or sponges which will prevent the blood leaving your body when you shower, but really dont worry about leaking in the shower, theres nothing gross about it.     Really honey, its not good to think of any part of your body as gross, I know socially we have all sorts of negative ideas about our periods and our bodies but if you continue to think like that youre really going to have a hard time during your periods.|`|fFpa0rz9aa	Imagine those little droplets of blood, against the enormous amuont of droplets of watter surrounding you.  Don't worry, it'll dissolve in the water and you wont even notice. I think your period stops when you're in water too actually. Like,it lightens or w/e.  Well dont worry.It won't be the Red Sea or something, just shower like you nomallydo.    I felt like this the first time lmao.but its not bad. you wont even notice!|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	jump on the shower head and rub your vagina against the shower head.|`|AA10766729	When you urinate, the blood that is on your vulva & labia is diluted and washed into the water in the toilet, making it look like MUCH more blood than it actually is.    When you get in the shower, rinse your vulva with warm water and you should be fine.  You might leak a VERY little bit, but it's nothing to be alarmed over.    And when you get out of the shower, have a small dark hand towel available to dry your private area before dressing.    Remember, the average amount of menstrual fluid that is released every month is around 2-3 tablespoons full, and that's for the entire time.  Not very much at all.|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	it always looks more when you go to the bathroom that it actually is, just wipe all the blood away and the shower, it is really important to keep that area clean when you are on your period, i have baths when i  am on my period and i dont even see any blood so do not worry, just have a tampon and pants or pants with a pad in ready for as soon as you get out. There will probably be blood on the towel but do not worry, it should wash out  good luck hun xxx|`|TTogBTYxaa	Well the others answered it really :)  But What I always do is I go the toliet first, wipe it all away and then the second you get in the shower but the hose right at your privates so it gets cleaned first then nothing even comes out so you don't have to worry.. and the second you get out have your pants with the pad stuck on it ready to put on you.. Hope I helped a bit :)|`|KkmEUe1qaa	water can wash it away..|`|iYSYLUa1aa	well its got to be cleaned   EWW!
VRMQIuD0aa	More than likely it is HPV. Although it is not curable outbreaks occur infrequently and most of the time they clear up on their own over a few months or more.  You can get cremes prescribed to help.  Be sure you tell any other partner you sleep with that you possibly have HPV. It can cause cervical cancer in women. Eat healthy and take a multivitamin everyday to keep your immune system fighting! Don't be freaked out, HPV is extremely common. My fiance has it and it has never been a big nuisance in our lives.|`|MWsI9Uu4aa	If a doctor said it could be herpes, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say yeah, could be herpes.|`|fKedbYR4aa	Dude, I'd definitely go get tested.

If she gives you the gift that keeps on giving.. i'd give her a gift of a boot in the face.|`|n0WnEIopaa	It could just be irritated skin or hair follicles. Maybe from the rubbing, and wetness(especially if you didn't shower after, and dry off properly).    Are they tiny little bumps or larger?    Was she a virgin?    Here are some herpes pics;   http://www.famvir.com/info/tools/toolspr...  http://dermatology.about.com/od/dermphot...    But I believe if they were herpes, they are blisters, and would hurt!

4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	Relax.  We all get it at some point, even when we were 14. It will come 'out' eventually and all will run smoothly for you again.    You are fine, you are normal and you are not dying or ill.  It is just a sluggish digestive system or food that you ate which is making your poop harder to pass.  Relax, don't worry about it and good luck.    :)|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	The more water and fiber you can consume the better your chances for not having this happen.  If it persists, get an over the counter laxative and follow directions on the package.|`|koAaPXKQaa	It doesn't mean you're dying or anything! It's so common and you'll probably experience this alot more as you get older. Eat alot more fruit if you can and drink some water. You just need to get more fibre in your diet and it should help. If you find there's nothing helping at the moment, you should get a mild laxative to help you. Sennakot is quite good.    If you begin to experience this alot then you should visit your GP as it shouldn't happen all the time.    Hope I have helped a little.|`|exh2uAlEaa	TOTALLY normal, i had it at age 12, and sometimes i still get it now at 15. it is going to be aggrivating and painful, but the more u think about it the harder its gonna be.     to help start eating more plums and prunes. those help u "go" alot, and if it lasts a week, then ur gonna have to go for the laxative (which isnt that bad)  FEEL BETTER!! :)|`|HSPlRQd9aa	Heeyyaaa haddd ittt loadss off timesss haha andd immm 11 haha dw lol and u can get this like medicine called cali fig or summin like that and it helps but make sure u take it like wen u get in from skl coz if u take it before skl ull be embareesed coz like u reli need to go and there loads haha good luck hhee x|`|fVMzCP5raa	Youll be finee|`|SUR1MHqWaa	Hi try eating prunes or drinking prune juice, liquorice, pineapple juice or any high fibre food which might shift you.

I dont know wether it is something to do with not drinking much cos i dnt i drink like 2 glasses of pop a day so maybe it could!!!|`|6CEia23Naa	You should eat a good balanced diet with plenty of roughage as this will help your normal 'motions'. Also not drinking enough can cause difficulties causing constipation.    If this happens constantly or you find you can't go again you should speak to your doctor about the best way to treat it for you. Make sure you are eating plenty of fruit and veg and drinking plenty of water as this should help you go too.|`|AA10356455	haha im 14 to ! and yeah this happends to me sometimes because i gave a problem with my bowls but no you arent dieing ! lol its probably just from eating to much dairy products or something , it happens to everyone at some point , okay so what i do is just eat alot of bran today and stay away from dairy  so by tomorrow you should have it out ! :) .. and dont panic it will eventually have to come out anyways !  good luck :)|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	You don't say how long you've been having this problem - if it's 3 or 4 days, take a glycerine suppository.  Longer than that, an enema would be best.|`|T7WwYZIAaa	Su is correct, however if you don't have a suppository you can try a small piece of soap inserted rectally.  If you are really blocked up I would go with the enema.|`|YhpCV1wbaa	Hi   Dont worry this is totally normal but very uncomfortable try drinking orange juice or prune juice it usually helps.
211wVaznaa	Usually doctor's offices do not hire nursing assistants.  Nursing assistants are usually needed to assist the nurse in hospital settings. Doctor's offices sometimes hire medical assistants. Medical assistants have to have some schooling for their career, and they assist the doctor by getting vital signs and making the patient comfortable in the exam room before the doctor arrives to see them. Hope this helps.
7bnQmXksaa	YASH, DR ATKINS SLIPPED ON ICE AND HIT HIS HEAD AND DIED LATER!!!! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT..   You need to understand how it works before you talk about it. please.   Who would give a thumbs down to a correct answer. You want to see before and after pictures? WOW !.    I have lost over 100 LBS on Atkins.. when you have no carbs in your system your system burns fat.  its called Ketoysis. It works for sure protein and fats not carbs = large weight loss.|`|AW1OWmOtaa	Atkins is basically diet in which carbohydrate intake is very restricted.  Click the link below to find all your other answers bout it :)  I personally don't agree with this diet but plenty of people do!|`|FfZBJzpbaa	Atkins doesn't work . Plain and simple . The founder Dr. Atkins who followed it died of a heart attack. You can't eat pork fat and be healthy any diet that promises that is bogus.|`|tIldpr7vaa	its mostly meats, few carbs, carbs are stored as fat    but u should not be eating fried foods, they may be low carb, but will have alot of calories, stick  with grill foods instead/ lean meats/ nuts/ veggies    S is totally right, But its not a permanent diet, just a way to shed the pounds, and once u lose the weight u can up ur carbs and still maintain ur weight
VnLaUS3Jaa	ideally, you need more of a variety to your diet. it sounds good for maybe a day or two out of the week, but not every single day of the week.    just follow the food pyramid and eat 5-6 mini meals per day (about 10 bites per sitting) and don't eat 3 hours before bed.     eating less more often keeps your metabolism up - - vital for weightloss!!|`|JYHlPczxaa	Easy (and Sexy) Ways to Lose 50 Pounds a Year      Exercise for 15-20 minutes. If you have a weight problem, chances are you also have a problem with regular exercise. That's probably because you tried to do too much. Just commit to 15 minutes a day. That's not hard at all. And don't do anything intense, especially for the first month. Take it easy -- do a few crunches, a few push ups, jog in place for a few minutes. If you do this every day, you'll burn 100-150 calories, depending on your size and metabolism.      ?  Replace a fatty snack with veggies. Potato chips, fries, anything that's greasy -- those are laden with calories. Fat is the most calorie-filled food type there is. If you eat a snack like this every day, replace it with cut-up carrots, broccoli, celery, or a salad (with low-fat dressing, not anything fatty).      ?  Have sex daily. One of the best exercises there is. Of course, you'll need to do it beyond your usual three minutes. If you can get 15 minutes of sex in a day, you can burn 150 calories. You also might need to find a willing partner. The exercise in the item above might help with that.
WXpdkbG8aa	Nah. My best friend would get hers two weeks in a month, every 5 months, etc. If it bothers you badly, birth control pills will regulate your period. :) Good luck.|`|exh2uAlEaa	no, happens to me too, the doctor said it will straighten itself out sooner or later, if not, thats okay 2

K7x1RHVFaa	Basically there is no legal way to make more income without reporting more income.    It all relates to him being able to spend the cash he makes. If he can not spend the cash he makes then it is not income. Example, he works as the apartment super for an apartment rent free but he is on duty 24/7. He only gets the apartment because he has to live in that apartment. In this case he never gets the money for the work but poof magically he has no rent owed. Suddenly more of his other earning are free to pay for other things. Same goes for if you can find drug programs that offer free medicines for the indigent. He gets all his medicines free and more of his income is free for other things. There are also charitable jobs that pay no money but offer benefits like free meals. In all of these cases there is no income but the income you make no longer has to be used for your current expenses.    Good Luck.

ufgv7oTjaa	Texas is right that checking with a doctor (or pharmacists are generally more apt to answer) because both doctors and pharmacists have access to a database of drug and supplement interactions. In fact, the general rule of thumb before taking any new drug or supplement is to check with a doctor or pharmacist just to make sure they won't interact.    In general, Acai has no side effects unless you're allergic to it (which is rare). You can see more information at http://www.drugs.com/npp/acai.html  I hope I helped!|`|S730dpLfaa	Posypat, read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...

I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was http://starturl.com/efblc -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.
2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	Absolutely WAIT until after her doctor tells you it's safe.  If she's newly pregnant the embryo will need time to get securely "nestled in".  After everything you've been through, I think it would be in your best interest to relax and  just wait until the doctor himself/herself tells you that it's okay to have intercourse.
683fba774a10fec8e7e8b8ea4c6b7561aa	The commonest cause for the Injuries over the joints to take longer time to heal, is the constant movement of the joint making the delicate cicatrix formed during healing to break when ever it tries to heal.  Other causes include diabetes, terminal arteritis, burgers disease(TAO), rheunauds syndrome etc.,.  Hence you may please see that the finger joint is not moved for some days for a quick healing or the wound.  However if the problem still persists please see your doctor.|`|AA10500537	you may have sugar diabitis go see your dr get checked|`|zc9yo2ETaa	um, GO TO DOCTOR, dude thats seriuos, you might have the HIV virus.

Yeah, you'll be rate. Probably just on the joint. Get some superglue and glue it shut (seriously, superglue was originally designed for abrasions in war), and that'll make sure it stays clean and doesn't open back up while it heals. As long as it's not green or infected, you'll be okay.|`|GG4PxT25aa	OK what you need to do is put the antibiotics on the cut, then put a band-aid over the cut then wrap your whole finger with surgical tape (not to tight, but tight enough to keep your finger straight.) or if surgical tape isn't an option you could also use a splint of some kind. also make sure to change the bad-aid, antibiotic and tape everyday and wash it as well in between changes.|`|G9PzMfqgaa	Hi - yes it will make a difference as every time you bend your finger you will break the bond that has started to form between the skin that is the healing process beginning. It's difficult to keep your fingers straight enough so it may just take longer to heal and providing it is free of infection should heal well if you take care of it. If you wear a plaster during the day remember to take them off at night to let it breathe.|`|sEFmjAJkaa	Yes,  tape it so it keeps it straight.....  so it can't bend.|`|V2c0dAtwaa	Oh noes...

The antibiotics were to ward off infection, not aid healing.  If you're really worried about it, go back to the doctor, don't rely on the answers that you get here.  They just write anything to get two points, they don't care about helping.|`|bKenpcoiaa	You don't want it to bend. Get a splint.  Put fresh neosporin and a clean band aid on it everyday.  At nights let it air out and wash it with soap and water.  After 2 hours or so put another clean band aid and neosporin on again. You may have the HIV virus if it doesn't heal in a week.

Barbers and hairdressers often cut their fingers there. Try making a splint and sticking a plaster to it and covering the wound. Use a Lollypop stick and secure it. This allows the finger to remain straight therefore allowing the wound to remain closed.|`|zHD8tnDBaa	Could be infected|`|VtRM7YEFaa	yes, see you use your finger joint constantly so the cut doesnt have that period to heal.

1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	Its a multi vitamin.|`|AA11447210	Dietary supplements are used to help us get the amount of a particular vitamin, mineral, herb, etc that we desire to have but that our diet cannot or does not provide (either at all or enough of).    Many people take multivitamins, for example, because it's very hard to get the recommended daily allowance of all the vitamins and minerals our body needs, through the typical foods we eat (especially nowadays with so many people living on fast food and processed food).    Some people also take various herb supplements or megadoses of vitamins for particular reasons...either for better health, better physicaly performance, because of a deficiency, to ward of disease, etc.    Supplements are just that...supplements. They are meant to SUPPLEMENT our diet (in addition to), not replace it.|`|tIldpr7vaa	it can be many things, but no its not intended to replace food. this isnt the future yet, we can eat pills for a meal.|`|VRMQIuD0aa	No you don't take it instead of food.  It supplements the food you eat.  Meaning it provides extra nutrients in addition to the nutrients you get from the food you eat.  Dietary supplements range from Vitamin A to St. John's Wort to Echinacea. There are alot of benefits in dietary supplements. You should read into some of them!

My dad says it's because i was in my mum in the winter and born in the summer and my sister who is NEVER ill was born in the winter and was in my mum in the summer, know apparantly babys in the womb in summer have a higher immunne system than babys in the womb in winter - i know this has nothing to do with your question but any ways      I have a low immune system and i had Gallandular fever in year 5 (now in year 10) and i couldnt breath through my mouth or eat or drink ANYTHING. not even soup, and drinking water was a challange.  But no its probually not the croup, its probually you just have a low immune system like me, i catch everything and everything ( and i even start them going round ;]) and get them 1000 x worse than everybody else. It sucks, i have the worst attendance in my class but when ever im off im actually ill not lying or anything.  its just the luck of the draw i think.  x|`|cnnu1IFtaa	No, there is no link between having croup as a young child and having throat infections (which are extremely common) as a teenager.|`|ZsCqfPaZaa	It's very unlikely.  Lots of kids have croup when they're younger, and since you didn't even have the operation (sounds like a cricothyrotomy?), it especially shouldn't be an issue.  You probably get sick a lot now because you're in school and hardly anyone washes their hands -- high infection rates.    There's no such thing as a stupid health question. :)|`|edkMmRi9aa	Well, I'm not sure if those are caused because of croup, but  check www.webmd.com, they have a symptom checker and you can see if those have anythign to do with croup... hope I could help!
bFKjV7U5aa	I need to correct one of the above posters. ADD/ADHD is a mental disease. It is not simply a personality trait. It is listed in the DSM as a mental disease.|`|8IzeMTmLaa	Yes, it genetic just like ASD, ADD, Tourette's Syndrome and other things of this nature.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	According to wikipedia, it has a 75% strong genetic component.  So it could be inherited if certain genes are passed on to the child.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	It's a personality trait, not a disease, but it appears to be a disease because it doesn't fit in with our complex society. And it is inherited.|`|dmznRvjEaa	yes it can, my daughter inherited it from her father.|`|XSTjyO1naa	Yes, it can be inherited. Research has now prove it.   Check for the source link on ADHD.

If you cant find it there, I would ask the pharmacist and they will usually be able to hrlp you.  Hope this helps you any.

I've known people in high school that were chronic marijuana users and it did not "enhance" or deter their 'shroom' experience.   Mushrooms are very dangerous. For someone to take them with no previous experience on what drugs can do to the body, the effect may be devastating. That said, eating mushrooms can be very devastating the first time people take it, regardless of their previous experience.|`|eTfmnnDoaa	in my opinion it doesn't really make a difference if you eat shrooms then smoke a bowl. it just makes you more drowsy, if you are like me but it all depends on how the weed is and whether it has a higher thc level or a higher canabanoid level, thc being the downer and canabanoid being an upper. just make shure that you don't have to do any coherent walking or talking hope you have fun : ]|`|W08qzLu6aa	dude mushrooms aren't all that crazy, just depends on how much you eat. Eat a little bit and you'll have a great buzz and awesome feelings, eat a lot and you will straight up see god. When not ingesting alot, weed will enhance your trip a bit, and is pleasant. When you are coming down, smoke a few bowls and your trip will creep back.|`|Jub8KYUEaa	one night me and some friends went to an amusement park[halloween theme] i had smoked a few bowls and ate about an 1/8 of shrooms[mostly caps]. the weed mellowed me out but i did not have a good trip at all on the shrooms. i had a seizure and started passing out.. i was tripping too i thought i was gonna die lol....no shrooms for me...|`|ONEUGti0aa	plenty of friends that had shrooms for the first time and they all were trippin off the littlest ****. lmao. id suggest u put it down|`|exMPHWKHaa	You will need to eat the whole 1/8th to have a real trip. No I do not recommend smoking weed and eating shrooms unless your doing it to ease your stomach. Other then that you should avoid it because the weed could cause you to have anxiety and might turn into a panic attack. Good luck.|`|6c6785164ea96d97863d16bfbe2becb1aa	I prefer smoking when i trip.  It calms me down some and gets me back to "normal" whenever things get too intense.  If you usually smoke buds then smoke if you eat shrooms but if you usually don't then i wouldn't.  Eat the whole eighth to get messed up.

Place a piece of tissue on the tip of each finger to avoid slipping, which could tear the skin and cause further damage.     6.

I don't think it's really a "disease" per se, but it's a personality trait that would be useful if you lived in a primitive society where you walk around talking to people, finding random things to eat, and have little tasks to do all day, but it is hard to reconcile with living in a complex society with rules and structure.

It sounds to me that you're just not motivated to doing anything productive and you're justifying it by saying "it's all a lie".  If you can focus on stuff that interests you, but not what you're told to, then it's not a problem of attention, because otherwise you wouldn't be able to concentrate on *anything*.  If I had to guess I'd say you have a personality disorder.  IF you truly want to change then find a mental health professional that can educate you in DBT - Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.  But if you're only looking for a justification for doing nothing with your life, I wouldn't bother getting help.

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	It comes from genetically engineered corn and that is causing huge allergic reactions in many people and it is a sugar that affects your blood sugar.  To get a better idea of why genetic engineering is bad for you, get the DVD from:  "www.thefutureoffood.com" and you will see why you do NOT want to eat that junk.    "Regular sugar" is better, in that it is NOT genetically engineered yet.  However, all sugar is NOT good for you and out bodies are NOT designed to deal with it properly.  Sugar was introduced in the human food chain about 400 years ago and REFINED sugar was introduced about 100 years ago.  The average person ate about less than 10 pounds of sugar in the early 1900's and that was considered a lot.  The incidence of cavities increased dramatically from 1915 to 1930 to alarm many dentists and there was a big search that went on to determine what was causing it.  Today, the average person consumes over 200 pounds of sugar each year.  That is simply overwhelming the body and causing huge problems and many diseases.  Is it no wonder over 26% of all Americans are now prediabetic or diabetic?  80% are overweight and 30% OBESE!  Processed foods cause heart disease.    It's important to look beyond the labels on foods because many animals are fed garbage that you eat and the plants are being fertilized with garbage.  When you see that a canned food contains brocolli, it is easy to assume it's good for you until you realize how that brocolli was fertilized and sprayed.  Then the contents of the can are radiated or pasteurized and little food value comes out of that whole mess.     Did you know that corn plants are now mostly genetically engineered and contain insecticide genes so when bugs eat it, they die?  What do you think happens when you eat it?  The rest of the world will NOT buy U.S. food products now due to this genetic engineering problem.  It is going into animal food, shipped to 3rd world countries, and food programs designed by our government.      And cancer is soon to be the number one killer in the U.S. by 2010.  So where are the so called experts and scientists looking for the answers?  In some magic pill.  Cancer is a modern man's disease and high fructose corn syrup is part of the problem.    good luck to you|`|riFDDdscaa	Only, has a great write up. HFCS is designed to be the same as table sugar. Table sugar is one molecule of fructose and one molecule of glucose, but your body has to split the molecules apart The molecules in HFCS are not combined, but available immediately. The latest problem with HFCS is that 70% of all products that contain it, are testing positive for mercury. 200 pounds of mercury tainted sugar per year? No thanks.|`|pRF5LLloaa	HFC is bad for you because it is so concentrated.  It has MUCH more sugar in it that regular table sugar.  it raises your blood sugar higher than regular sugar.    HFC has no genetic material involved.  It is high  processed, and the effects of "genetically engineered" corn are completely removed.  there is no difference between "genetically engineered" HFC and "natural" HFC.|`|gNBKvQuMaa	Great Informative Info By OnlyMat!!  On top of what he said I recently came across some alarming FACTUAL info on HFS, they have KNOWN since at least 2005 that in its processing there IS MERCURY in the HFS and they are doing NOTHING about it, NO products are being pulled, NO info to or for the public!! Mercury is very bad for you and HFS is found in just about every commercial product out there and you should know even Health Food Stores aren't completely safe and healthy, they have many products still with chemicals,GMOS and HFS!!    Nature did however make some GREAT alternatives: Agave Nectar, Pure Maple and Honey...Given you aren't like to find these in a soda but they are far more healthier in general and I have found some products that use these instead of any sugar...I might add, your doctor won't likely tell you this, if you have cancer anyone out there, SUGAR FEEDS the CANCER GROWTH!|`|hD25pT1Laa	Regular sugar contains one fructose and one glucose molecule bound together to make sucrose. Fructose and glucose are both simple sugars, but your body uses them in different ways. Glucose is burned as fuel and is moderated by insulin. Fructose isn't. Fructose is metabolized primarily by your liver and is mostly converted to fat and stored. Glucose makes you feel full after you eat it because it makes your blood sugar rise. Fructose doesn't. So, fructose is bad because it causes you to eat more because you are still hungry, and makes you fat which causes diabetes because it isn't burned like glucose. Regular sugar is less bad for you than high fructose corn syrup, but since it is half fructose, it still isn't good for you.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	There is no sweetening product that is actually good for any diabetic. They are good for some other people and for them it is a great thing.    It isn't that high fruictose corn syrup is so bad for people, it is that it is so addictive that too many people eat too much of it. The same with any sweet product.    I have used high fructose corn syrups for years for raising orphaned livestock. Blended with a product like half and half milk it is a good baby starter.    Example of high fructose corn syrup you have in your kitchen pantry? White or Light KARO! or Dark KARO! We have been using this in our kitchens for nearly a century!    Get over it!|`|AA12225520	THE MAIN culprit for the presence of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in all sweetened foods in the U.S., is the state. By placing a high tariff on sugar produced in other countries they drove manufacturers to use HFCS!  The U.S. government would rather force manufacturers to use inferior and hazardous high fructose corn syrup, which can be created from corn  a crop grown in the U.S.  than allow them to use more natural sugar from places that seem rather obvious.  THIS IS THE REAL STORY.    The good news is STEVIA.  Stevia has a glycemic index of 0 and does not affect blood sugar. Stevia is 8-10 times sweeter than sugar! Coke and Pepsi are launching products which use stevia or some blend of it.

E8WrncLoaa	Avoid the cheeses and sauces and you're off to a good start. Salad dressing can be a big source of calories and fat, so choose the flavor carefully. Grilled chicken is good, especially compared to its crispy version. If you must have the dressings, ketchup and mustard carry fewer calories than mayo or ranch. Mustard or bbq sauce is pretty good on sandwiches as a substitute for the original sauce.|`|hFnBeBMaaa	the ice cream because its a low fat ice cream.

In Supersize Me, they say that just about everything at McDonalds has sugar added to it, even the salads.    If you must choose, I would say the cut apple slices (minus the caramel) or the grilled chicken strips. You can get the crispy strips too, but they have more fat than the grilled strips since they're fried. That goes without saying you're better off skipping the sauces.|`|S5H0NmEWaa	The healthiest thing would be anything that makes you vomit up anything you've eaten at McDonalds.|`|2KC467tFaa	The only time I go to McDonald's is when I drank way too much water and need to use the restroom. Not only is there nothing healthy, but everything at McDonald's does harm to your body. There are absolutely NO nutrients in any of the "food" there. How about going to a grocery store and picking up some fruit to munch on throughout the day? Even the salads aren't exceptionally healthy. They consist of mostly iceberg lettuce (the white lettuce with little to no nutrients). To add flavor, you have to put dressing on it. Have you read the label on the salad dressing? I was floored when I saw how bad it is. I'm not talking about the empty calories when I refer to being unhealthy. At least you would be able to work out if you consumed a few too many calories. What I'm talking about is seriously harming your body... organs malfunctioning, mood swings, arteries clogging, and many other problems. Take care of your body. You only get one.

Man has been consuming trans fats for 50 to 80 years. Doesn't it seem strange that the increase in heart disease has only been in the last 50 to 80 years?

yLTIm5Vqaa	Could be a yeast infection, or it might just be some slight irritation. Wear comfy panties for a few days (cotton, not too tight, etc.) and buy some anti-itch wipes. I use these all the time and they work great, they're better than the creams. Vagisil makes some and there are other brands too.   Not every itch is a yeast infection, so don't buy medicine to treat one unless you're sure that's what it is.|`|0R5HYKyOaa	i think its itchy because its problably infected or something u should wash it 4 times a day, oh and u should probably go see a doctor!!|`|FfZBJzpbaa	You probably have a slight yeast infection ,if you have never had one go to the docs .

If you've never had thrush before go see your Dr. In the mean time, down lots of cranberry juice(contains natural anti-oxidents that really help with things like thrush and cystitis). and put a bit of natural, unflavored yoghurt on your 'bits'. That will help cool and sooth the skin. I avoid tight clothing But definately go see your Dr, dont leave it!
1IohvEWCaa	Well you are on the right track in terms of working out and eating healthy. However, instead of doing the workout bike, I would start jogging. Jogging and eventually running took off the weight for me.  First I started jogging at around 4.5 MPH. When I lost some weight, I started going faster. Now I am running very fast and still losing weight. So far I lost 40 pounds; I am 6 feet even and was 250, now I'm 210.|`|mgK3AxlCaa	Tell your parents to take you to a doctor;     He will reccomend a dietriciean.    :D    Good luck !|`|fQf8tyQLaa	At 13, you cant be very tall so you are very over weight..  Im not being mean hunny and you obviously already know this..

And reccomend the amount and what kind of excercises you need to do..

So I will tell you what makes you anorexic, I suppose: Not eating or barely eating to stay alive; or eating, but exercising so much that your body doesn't get any of the nutrients. If you're skin and bones. If you get sick extremely easily. If your bones are now the equivalent to a geriatric.|`|koAaPXKQaa	Anorexia is an eating disorder that stems from mental ill-health.

Yes, you are likely underweight at 7 stones, but you would only be diagnosed as anorexic if you were deliberately starving yourself to get to that weight.|`|QGsYPJoKaa	Even though your weight influences it, it certinaly doesnt determine whether you are. My brother is exactaly the same as you, and hes 6ft, but he isnt anorexic/bulimic he just has a quick metabolic rate and just isn't that keen on food. He still eats and everything but doesnt over do it.  So, no. Just because your skinny doesnt mean your anorexic, and the fact your trying to find out and stuff shows your probably not aswell. Your weight is just a side effect, nothing more.|`|Zz1HI5VHaa	Most of the information out there addresses this condition as a female problem. Please do not be offended at the wording of the messages. it is possible for a male to be anorexic but it is much more common in girls.     Here is a really good website to help you figure out this answer.|`|Q7kNtNSRaa	omg i'm 13 and i only weigh one stone less than you. jeeeeeeeeeez! eat up man!|`|ODvnyAdlaa	you do need to significantly up your calorie intake. If you dont eat and get anxious around food then i would say you do have what sounds to be anorexia. Try and either cut down on exercising so much or eat more. You are too light for your age and sex. You should increase your calcium intake as this is your key time for bone development and being that under weight can lead to oestroporosis. See a doctor who may be able to suggest a psychiatrist (if you do have anorexia) and a dietician. Good luck. xxx.|`|Swmd0P2uaa	I would also need to know your height in feet and inches, to calculate your BMI. You can do it yourself with this BMI calculator. http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/ Your BMI, is basically a rough guide to what a healthy weight would be for your age and your height. In the box on this page, enter your height in feet, and inches. Then click 'Compute'. You will see this chart on the left:   BMI Categories:     Underweight =   Normal weight = 18.5-24.9   Overweight = 25-29.9   Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater     A BMI of 18.5 or less, is underweight. The BMI used to characterize - and diagnose Anorexia is 17.0 or less. The most specific measurement for finding your BMI is the skin fold measurements test.http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/BodyComp... But really, it is JUST AN ESTIMATE, so the first link should give you enough information to use in your self diagnosis. (you really should see your doctor)      Your BMI is just ONE characteristic of anorexia, certainly by no means is it the most important. You did not specify wether how many calories you consume a day. Here is a calculator that will give you an estimate of the total calories your body needs to maintain a healthy weight. http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie...     And of course, the MOST IMPORTANT thing, is how healthy you are psychologically. Anorexics have an INTENSE FEAR of becoming fat. The obsession with food is more that just the fear, is also about knowledge. Something I found myself doing, was fixing huge dinners for friends and baking almost everyday of the week. All I could think about was food, and even though I had no desire to eat any of it, I always want to be around it. There are plenty of other behaviors, read this and see if you find yourself fitting into any of the descriptions. http://www.mamashealth.com/anorexia.asp     I also wrote an answer for someone else asking the same question. You cacn check that out too theres more about expieriences.http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    GOOD LUCK!!!|`|DiFsOj5qaa	basically it only works one way.    you could be considered underweight depending on your height (you need to google BMI calculator it will tell u u need to know ur height and wait an dsee what colour u get on the chart - it's informative)      now! if ur underweight its' basically what the first person said.  if u dont eat ur anorexic, or if ur skipping meals or eating few calories a day (i dont know how many calories but how many do u consume anyway?? maybe check wiv a doc or someone who knows lots on diet, eatin / eatin disorders or sum1 whos a nurse or somethin)        but basically yeah if ur underweight it could be down to too much exercise / little food / starving urself of food    or a combination.  so you need to figure out if ur underweight or not and if so what it is that is causing this.  don't deny yourself the truth if you know it but please try find out what you have and please be well!  if you think you are anorexic you need help and to see a doctor. if you don't think you do then try to eat more and exercise a bit less!  don't go crazy but at least have 1500kcal a day. hope ur ok!    EDIT: it may even be a medical problem such as that type of diabetes for low weight or erm.. a thyroid problem or something? you need to identify if you do or do not know the problem. if you do you can work on it but if not u need to go to the docz... good luck.|`|sJQ6gG0Uaa	do you eat?    you are only anorexic if you refuse to eat, make yourself sick or excrete after eating, then you are bullemic|`|YJGEEJhWaa	i dont get male eating disorders because women hate skinny men, so why would they wanna be skinny??    girls on the other hand have to be skinny! not many guys fancy big girls!|`|OMApFdWnaa	anorexia is something in your head when you think that your fat when your not and you get more and more underweight    you probly are underweight but not anerexic|`|0psCy0XXaa	No that is well under weight you could die if your not carefull forget websites ask your doctor to refer you to a counciller who can help you.

I mean, being annorexic isn't only the weight. It's also in your head were no matter how many people tell you your skinny, or people tell you your too skinny. You still feel fat. Where you will look in the mirror, and think, I am so fat, and see an obese body looking back at you.    Were you will stop eating and give yourself an eating disorder, to be skinnier.

If you naturaly became that weight, with eating healthily..and you have no issues with food then NO your not anorexic..  But , how ever, if you worked to become so light .. And your in a mental state of mind involveing food constantly then chances are YES you are anorexic..  My friend, a female, is a little heavier than you, same height and i think shes too skinny ..so for a male you are under weight atleast..|`|bJgz5xGzaa	We need to know your exact height!  I am a 17 year old boy and i weigh 10stone exactly. I'm 5'8" and when I calculate my BMI (body mass index) it says that I am at the lower end of a "healthy BMI".  So considering that I am quite short, like you, and I'm considered healthy at 10stone, I would definitely say that you are underweight.   To say whether you are anorexic or not is complicated because it depends on whether or not you eat. If you eat a good amount of food and are still at 7 stone then you probably have either and extremely metabolism, or you may have thyroid problems.   I suggest you calculate your BMI at http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_livi... and count your caloric intake to make sure you are eating enough.|`|rLzvq0aPaa	Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric illness that describes an eating disorder, characterized by extreme low body weight and body image distortion, with an obsessive fear of gaining weight.  While the condition primarily affects adolescent females, approximately 10% of people with the diagnosis are male.  If you are using extreme measures to lose weight like purging or extreme exercise and are obsessed with being skinny then I think you may be anorexic. On the other hand your still growing at 17 and if your genes are short and skinny then most likely your not. If your concerned about it and are purging or doing something too extreme to lose weight please talk to your parents, doctor or school councilor because anorexia is a serious disease and can cause death if not treated.|`|tpTOtl7haa	It depends on your height and your metabolism rate. If you have quite a fast metabolism then you may not be underweight. You are NOT anorexic. anorexia is a condition characterised by an obsessive desire to lose weight. Unless you have an obsessive desire 2 lose weight.

Panic and flincing when loud noises are made or when a hand is lifted.  Mental- calling themselves bad names and being down on themselves.

Self hatred  mis-trust of other people  feeling they deserve punishment for small things "I missed a spot on the floor when mopping. I should be ripped to pieces."  Avoiding eye contact or covering bruises can be a sign too.

It's so hot at night here at the moment. If your problems getting to sleep are related to just the heat and nothing else, then no, you are not suffering from insomnia.  I'd suggest - sleeping with just a sheet, having a fan (even just a portable one, you can get them cheap at the hardware or whaever) directed at you, having the window open, and sleeping with less clothes on. Drink lots of water during the day, and make sure you get to bed at a reasonable hour.    If you still have trouble getting to sleep, and you don't think it's heat-related, go to your chemist or maybe a health food store and ask about over-the-counter sleeping aids/natural insomnia remedies. If these don't work, you should speak to your GP.    All the best.

SErhF1OSaa	WRITE!  When i feel like I am losing myself, losing control, I grab a piece of paper and just write whatever is in my mind and will make sense of it later.  Once I get started, I go on for a long time, even doodling some.  Maybe it will help clear your head?  When I am going into a hypo-manic state and my mind races....I write down everything and anything that comes to mind.  I have a journal on the computer also and my fingers on the keyboard can move faster than writing, so I will use that too.

gpv6o2oraa	What you are experiencing is normal side effects of this medication and they should go away after a few days of being off the medication. Then you will be feeling back to normal. Good Luck and Congratulations on your new life! |`|qEAqAD4Laa	I will try to answer your question but it is difficult due to not knowing how long you were on Subetex.  Subetex as you may know is a brand name for the drugs buprenorphine and naloxone.  Buprenorphine is a combination opiate/antidepressant, Naloxone is an opiate antagonist, combined they provide relief from withdrawls and the depression which can occur;  the antagonist will cause very unpleasant side effects if the patient tries to use a narcotic while undergoing  treatment.  It is well known that these drugs do cause withdrawls when stopped or if the dose is reduced too quickly.  I'm not sure why you have been switched over to plain Suboxone which is buprenorphine without the antagonist Naloxone.    You say you are taking 2mg?  if that is once a day I do not believe it is wise to stop this drug abruptly.  No drug which has been used for a substantial amount of time should be stopped abruptly, tapering is always the best and safest method.    From the symptoms you describe it sounds as if you are going through a withdrawl of Subetex.  The Suboxone should help with that if you are given the appropriate dosage.  In my opinion you are not taking a sufficient amount of Suboxone to counter the withdrawl effects.  You may need the dose adjusted to help give you back energy and stave off depression which can become quite problematic if not kept in check.  I would advise you to speak to your doctor, tell him/her what is happening and ask that your dosage be adjusted.  It is never wise to rush the process of tapering down off a drug and your body will give you all the warning signs you need to know it is happening  too fast, too soon.  I must say I highly respect your strength and courage in taking the steps to overcome your addiction to heroin.    It is the most difficult fight and I wish you all the success in the world.|`|AA11423824	Your right you know.  I was a cronic heroin abuser up to a week ago,$100 per day. I stopped using a new treatment that will benifit you,no cravings to use again.  Its all down to ameo-acids and re-ballencing your brain.  in the first 2 days comming off heroin take as much vitamin-c as you can,(itt can cause loose bowles)  take as a suplement L-Tryptophane 1000mg per day....increases seritonim creation.  also GABA and niacin if you cant get GABA take Glutamine with Taurine.  Melatonin will help you sleep.....you will be back to nomal in 2- 3 days  peace and love...spread the word.

You should trust your doctor.  The frequency of this happening is not as common as transmitting warts sexually, but it does happen.

By genital only.|`|p4K2buKXaa	Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and are USUALLY sexually transmitted. What gets confusing is that there are over 30 types of HPV, some like types 1, 2, and 3 which cause warts on fingers, type 4 which likes the bottom of the feet, and types 6 and 11 which are the genital ones. Several HPV types are linked to cancer risk, like type 35 for cervical cancer.     HPV is a hardy virus that can be spread by skin-to-skin contact with another person, sexual activity, or by self-innoculation (from carrying the virus on your fingers to other parts of your body). It can lie dormant in your body, so a person may be infected with it but display no symptoms.    It is definitely possible.
N5x8mcKsaa	think of yourself as a beautiful person and only focous on the positive things about yourself and you would start to feel better and think better about yourself.|`|AA12365169	Think about what you do have. I think you should just take a while to calm down and just realize what you do have. Everyone isn't perfect. Nobody had confidence. but if they do, they're usually cocky.|`|SG27rfSdaa	I was pretty much like you in high school if not worse.  It takes time to get over that stuff- most likely you have low self esteem because of your upbringing or family. Somebody must be telling you you're no good or making you feel that way.  It would be great if you could get counseling since you're aware of this fact. Kudos to you- Knowing the problem is half solving it. Seek help in this regard and I guarantee you start feeling better.  Shyness on the other hand is tough but you can get help for that too.

Como escolher o convnio  1) Observe a solidez e a credibilidade da empresa.  2) Pesquise qual o tamanho da rede credenciada.  3) Verifique se h bons mdicos no plano.  4) Atente para a qualidade dos servi?os prestados.  5) Levante qual o valor reembolsado pelo plano caso voc utilize servi?os mdicos fora da rede.   A indstria da sade      O setor de sade no Brasil est, h tempos, na UTI. A origem do mal  financeira. A equa??o formada por receitas e despesas simplesmente n?o fecha em muitas operadoras de medicina privada. De um lado, os clientes reclamam do pre?o das mensalidades. De outro, mdicos, hospitais e laboratrios protestam contra o valor recebido pelos servi?os prestados. As empresas de medicina de grupo, tidas como vil?s, tambm sofrem. Quase 30% delas encerraram o balan?o do ano passado com prejuzo, de acordo com estudo da Capitolio Consulting, de Braslia.     " muito difcil encontrar um equilbrio neste triangulo formado por usurios, mdicos e operadoras", afirma o ortopedista Nelson Astur Filho, presidente da Associa??o das Clnicas e Consultrios do Estado de S?o Paulo (Acoesp). No meio dessa disputa, o elo mais fraco  o consumidor, que fica sem saber qual plano de sade escolher. Uma pesquisa recm-divulgada pela Acoesp pode ajudar a resolver o dilema.    Levantamento realizado pela associa??o junto a mdicos de S?o Paulo apontou quais os melhores e os piores planos de sade do mercado. A pesquisa tomou como base o universo de 2 mil mdicos cadastrados na associa??o. O resultado apontou a Sul Amrica como a melhor operadora. Na ponta de baixo do ranking ficou a Royal Sade, de S?o Paulo.     A pesquisa levou em conta critrios como valor da remunera??o paga aos mdicos, pontualidade no pagamento, quantidade de atendimento, interferncia da operadora na realiza??o dos procedimentos, n?o-pagamento de exames realizados, facilidade de comunica??o e patamar de burocracia dos convnios.    Se itens como remunera??o interessam mais  classe mdica, quest?es como burocracia e interferncia das empresas nos procedimentos dizem respeito ao cotidiano dos usurios. "Algumas operadoras colocam uma srie de restri??es e de burocracia para n?o atender aos pedidos de exames mdicos s para reduzir custos", diz Astur Filho, da Acoesp.    O resultado, entretanto, comprovou uma das leis bsicas do capitalismo: a sade financeira  um indicativo de produtividade e de eficincia. As empresas com mensalidades mais caras ficaram com as melhores posi??es no ranking. "Quem cobra mais do cliente paga melhor ao mdico, consegue ter uma maior rede credenciada, remunera os prestadores de servi?o em dia e os clientes ficam mais satisfeitos", afirma o mdico Carlos Alberto Suslik, coordenador do MBA Executivo em Gest?o de Sade do Ibmec de S?o Paulo.     A teoria que amarra pre?o  qualidade dos servi?os encontra, porm, srios opositores. "Pre?o n?o significa qualidade nem pagar mais  garantia de que o cliente n?o ter problemas com o seu plano de sade", pondera Renata Molina, supervisora do setor de sade do Procon de S?o Paulo.    Prova disso, segundo ela,  que as principais reclama??es recebidas pelo Procon-SP, como reajustes de pre?os e n?o cobertura de procedimentos mdicos, atingem todos os segmentos de seguradoras, empresas de auto-gest?o, cooperativas e operadoras de sade. "Os problemas s?o os mesmos para todos, sem distin??o", resume Renata.     E como ficam as operadoras que amargaram uma m posi??o na pesquisa? A maioria questiona a metodologia do levantamento. Em nota enviada  DINHEIRO, Dix-Amico, Life System e Serma argumentam que o universo de mdicos pesquisados  muito pequeno frente ao nmero total de credenciados.    J a Blue Life disse que pratica um pre?o justo e cumpre a legisla??o vigente. O superintendente da Royal Sade, Jos Silva dos Santos, reconheceu que a empresa teve problemas de atraso de pagamento no passado, mas que a situa??o j est resolvida. Para o presidente da Acoesp, o importante  que a pesquisa sirva para alertar tanto os consumidores quanto as operadoras. "Esperamos que elas vejam quais s?o seus pontos fracos e possam melhorar", diz Astur Filho.     Fonte: Revista Isto  Dinheiro|`|13501b1e2dcdaac5927f6c7b0a422621aa	Abre uma poupan?a pra isso.

GMgsaFFBaa	I am assuming you are referring to the "negative" symptoms in the clinical sense? In that case, they are the symptoms most characteristic of the prodromal and residual phases such as:  anhedonia (defect in pleasure capacity)  restricted/blunted affect  social withdrawal  amotivation  apathy  underproductive speech  They get the name "negative" because they are symptoms that represent an absence of what would normally be present in someone without the disorder and are difficult to treat and generally unresponsive to meds, particularly older meds. The "positive" symptoms are those seen during acute phases and represent the presence of symptoms that would not normally be seen in someone without the disorder. They include hallucinations, delusions and other distorted thinking as well as eaggerated or inappropriate affect and bizarre behavior.

Y9S2QO73aa	Girls have 2 ovaries and each month a ova(unfertilised egg) gets released from each ovarie alternatively the ova travells through the falopian tube and comes to the uterus now the main purpose of this is that nature wants the ova to fuse with a sperm and hence aid in procreation.The uterus(which houses the infant) is all prepared to recieve the zygote(ova+sperm) now when the fusion of the sperm and the ova doesnot take place the wall of the uterus which was prepared for the infant ditaches form the rest of the uterus and the ova along with bolld is exuded form the body as the menstrual blood or period as u would say.

The vagina is a small opening that girls have between their legs. The bleeding will last for a few days and usually happens every month. This bleeding is sometimes referred to as menstruation and is not something to be scared of. Some girls get a white stain in their panties before they have had their first period, and this means their first period may begin soon.     Most girls will have their first period between the ages of 11 and 14. But some girls will start as early as 8, whilst others may be as late as 17.     Once a girl has had her period a few times she may notice that her body or mood changes slightly beforehand. For example, her breasts may feel sore, or become larger, or she may get spots on her face. But no one can tell if a girl has her period just by looking at her.     she will have it once a month so beware of moodswings |`|Y0CICtRiaa	Period?  In class?  It is 45 minute long.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Sex should never be painful, the idea of sex hurting the first time is myth as although it can hurt that doesn't mean it will nor that you should tolerate pain rather than stop if it hurts. A virgins body isn't different to the body of someone who's had sex, the problem of pain comes when a girl isn't ready to take that step or when there's no understanding of changes her body has to go through before sex. A teenage girls body is no different from an adults body either, unless it is a particularly young teenage girl as a childs vagina is smaller with subtble differences but of course a little girl shouldn't be having sex anyway, if we are talking 16+ her vagina is pretty well developed.     Vagina's are amazing, they can handle a baby so can easily take a penis, giving birth can be painful but vagina's are designed so sex shouldn't be, when aroused it actually doubles in size, opens, lubricates and muscles relax so penetration is possible and pleasurable. People often say loosing your virginity is painful because the vagina needs to stretch, but if that was true sex would hurt every time as the vagina does stretch but it always goes back to the original size. Arousal prepares the vagina for sex to prevent pain, penetration isn't the main attraction but often virgins rush foreplay forgetting it's part of sex and can be more fun than penetration. Lubrication helps too if your not wet enough, it's not a replacement for good foreplay but part of safe sex and adds to pleasure, although you need to know your stuff as different lubes are for different things.     I've said there's no difference between the body of a virgin and a non-virgin, that's not strictly true due to the hymen which is a thin layer of flesh partly covering the opening of the vagina in most girls. Your hymen can be broken before sex though masturbation or using tampons or cups, but if in tact sex can tore or stretch your hymen that can be painful, but it is just as likely to be pleasurable or have no feeling at all, it's different for everyone.     Sex is a lot about emotions too, many girls have sex because low self-esteem means they think a guy won't love them otherwise or will get a bad reputation, as they aren't ready for sex they tense up so penetration is forced making it painful, this is true of virgins and non-virgins alike. It's also true that if you expect sex for the first time to be painful you will tense up making penetration difficult and painful. Know what you want and talk to your partner, if you don't tell a guy you're not ready or it hurts he can't be held responsible, demand good sex by telling him how you feel and what turns you on, enjoy whatever happens safe in the knoweldge that if it does hurt you can stop, no good guy would think badly of you for this and it won't be the end of the world.     Sex is something you have to teach yourself about and you will spend your whole life learning, a good book on sex is Guide to Getting It On! By Goofy Foot Press also check out their web site http://www.goofyfootpress.com I'd recommend this article from a very good site called Scarleteen on the subject of painful sex 'From Ow! To Wow! Demystifying Painful Intercourse http://www.scarleteen.com/article/pink/f...|`|bZGv0dvnaa	common over and find out... ;)|`|i3pn4jNcaa	yes it hurts the first couple times. but after a while it becomes enjoyable once the hymen is broken in i guess you could say|`|ODYrypwaaa	Yes it does. It is very uncomfortable. It may take many tries before it become pleasurable for you. Please speak with an adult you trust before doing anything.  Make sure you are protected.  Even see the Crisis Pregnancy Center first.  They have alot of good info.|`|yLTIm5Vqaa	This is a common fear of young girls. But the truth is: Yes, it will be uncomfortable and a bit strange the first few times, but there is usually no real pain.   The reason people say sex will hurt the first time is because girls are born with a hymen (a small thin membrane just inside the vagina) that must be broken in order for penetration to occur. When the hymen rips, this is what causes the pain that people are referring to. But it is *extremely* rare for a girl to make it to her first sexual experience with her hymen intact. Most girls break their hymens playing sports, riding bikes, or using tampons, and they never even know it. If you've ever comfortably used a tampon, it is safe to say your hymen has already been broken. If this is the case, no, sex will not be painful, just a little uncomfortable until you get used to it.     Of course, you should never do anything you're not ready to do. Sex is a big step, so make sure you think things through. And always be safe! :)|`|lFZwChJmaa	It's different for everyone, for some people it doesn't hurt at all and for others it's reallyyy painful!  I recommend just relaxing, make sure you don't feel uncomfortable because if you're feeling tense it will hurt much more!  xx|`|pUvjh86naa	Most of the time it does, but sometimes it doesn't.

Maybe because neither of us really new what we were doing but it wasn't painful, more funny. If you build it up in your head as being painful you're going to be very tense and uptight which in the end, will make it worse. All i can recommend is have your first time with someone you know and trust. Make it a good memory! Mine is hilarious....|`|kj507W26aa	Every girl is different. Some do hurt and some dont.

Stick to fresh veggies and lowfat meats and fish.  Avoid foods high in fat, fried foods and don't eat anything that contains partially hydrogenated oils (trans fats).  Also stay away from fast food because it's loaded with fat, hormones and has lots of calories.    Girls are also impressed by a guy's smarts.  Looks can only get you so far.

AA11552673	Your best bet is to do some research.  I don't think a lot of people really know what makes a good doctor much less one to suit your needs.  Maybe you can start at the hospital and see if they have a listing of the doctors and whether or not they specialize in something (i.e. infertility) in particular.  There may be a listing of how many years each has practiced etc.  Your insurance company may also be of help in this area.  My insurance company gave me a list.  Your family doctor may also have a good recommendation.  We ended up going with the Ob that our family doctor referred us to.  Good luck!|`|ZX1AOUHvaa	If you're going to trust the health of your family to strangers on the net why not just use the yellow pages?    I mean no offense. It just seems extremely reckless to be looking for referrals from complete strangers. You might as well just go see *any* doctor.

So, for you it would be 6 months. Sometimes people can get over it in a lot less time though. This is just a guideline, not written in stone.    2-It also depends on how you are changing your life to try to have new types of fun. A lot of people that quit drinking find it difficult to find things that entertain them as much as drinking used to do, so they become annoyed and really bored. Sober life can be very boring if you're doing the same stuff as when you were drinking except without the booze. The key sounds absolutely silly, but it works for most. Write down some crazy things you might find entertaining. Some ridiculous examples are     -having a fight with your buddy in blowup sumo costumes  -sky diving  -hang gliding  --Having a water gun contest  -Going to a spiritual retreat   - Trying an aboriginal sweat lodge  - Writing a book  - volunteering    Then try to figure out which ones you can do on your budget. If you quit drinking, then take the amount you would spend on drinking for a week and choose what else to spend it on. Obviously after a while, you'll need to cut down on the spending. But the goal in your life right now is to have fun.    Obviously, some or all of the above won't suit your specific personality and interests, but it hopefully will give you a start!    Good luck!!!|`|UHIi8AuQaa	you say you drank for 2 years,was that solid drinking.like every night??? i dont really understand what you mean by 'normal'..............i drink every weekend,have done for 15 years...like the weekend is time to let your hair down............but i dont drink because im irritaable,bored or because i can only have fun when i drink............i drink to be socialable & cos i enjoy it.....drink really plays a way to big part in your life,i hope you can get some help,goodluck|`|nf7afK1Haa	nope, life pretty much feels like ****.  unless you find someone and touch them.  with their consent of course|`|Qg2Gnxlyaa	maybe a year or so.|`|1m6cOsn0aa	try smoking weed, or drinking lots of v8 splash|`|Gq35gmeOaa	well you should look into some extreme drug abuse that **** will clean anything up|`|xn60FHgwaa	Good question but i am sure the answers will vary depending on the person.

It sounds like you are not over your drinking days per say, As if you are holding onto the FUN days-.You can have fun it is a choice and a frame of mind.

You need to start getting out of the old rut and meet new people and go new places and broaden you scope of possibilities  of new and interesting things to do.Good Luck and keep on doing the best you can- be up beat and accept that you have a new life and make the best of it and be glad.|`|OLpWRv2uaa	Depends.. you may have damaged your liver/brain/ other organs so much that you will never be normal in terms of how your body functions.

Do not make this all about you! It is not your fault and it is not your problem. You are the child, they are adults. You did not cause this and you cannot fix it. Relax! You will get older and wiser - you will get a job and move out and away. Learn from this - Marry a man who understands commitment (a christian) and when you are the mom, don't fight in front of the children. Thing will get better - I promise! Moving out of my parents house was the best move I ever made. (They were happily married - but I for some reason was depressed and started wanting to move out when I was 14. I waited till I was 18 and out of high school. Collage rocks - you move out but they keep paying for almost everything. You must be able to support yourself).   You can't commit suicide because you know this is temporary. This is their life - yours has not even gotten started yet. Think of this as a training phase. Level one starts when you finish school.

I think you know the answer. You dont really want to die. You want your life to be better, and that is completely understandable. You should have a better life. And you will.     Honestly, people who talk about suicide and talk about their overwhelming depression arent really talking about suicide. They are mistaking a subconscious correlation betweem death and rebirth. People confuse death with an ending to the unpleasant status of things. What they fail to realize is that there is no new beginning, which is what they want.    If you find that a new beginning is what you are after, make one. Work on your grades and apply to an out of town school. Be what you want to be. You can't fix the problems that are making your life so miserable, but you can make yourself happy despite it.    Bottom line, you cant kill yourself because you dont want to die. You want to live differently.|`|WGUfF7reaa	I think that you need devotion!  Maybe a religion?  ........hannahjuani@ymail.com............

CuVnpxh3aa	Have you been checked for anemia? It only takes a blood test and you will know in a matter of hours or less if your Dr puts a rush on it. Have your Dr do a blood test for anemia. It has nothing to do with sleep, especially if you are taking a nap in the daytime as well. Call your Dr.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	maybe your body needs more rest.you should go to the doctor to get checked|`|AA10287830	You could have sleep apnea, one of the main causes of tiredness.  Mention it to your doctor.  You may have a sleep study done and be fitted with a CPAP, a machine that gives you continuous positive air pressure.  Sleeping with a CPAP can prevent heart attacks and strokes.  People who need and use a CPAP get a much better quality of sleep, eliminating the tired feeling.  Good luck.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	epstein barr syndrom|`|JoPY039caa	try to get 9-10 hours of sleep|`|ximWtKVuaa	It would be best for you to go to a sleep lab anyway but the tiredness could be caused by a lack of certain vitamins, minerals and overall nutrients in your diet ... even if you're not anemic these things do affect you.  You could also have a latent infection somewhere in your body like c.diff. (it can stay dormant in your bowels for a long time) or a bacterial imbalance in your stomach or intestines that is preventing you from absorbing the nutrients from your food (in which case you should eat probiotics and cultures).|`|fkqPs9QRaa	6 - 8 hours a nite isnt really enough sleep, though it kinda depends on age too.

In USA less intake of protein can't be a reason; however, sedentary life style or choice of food could be reason.  When I can't do any aerobic exercise for 3-4 days in a row, I am bound to feel quite tired all the time irrespecitve of number of hours I sleep.  Someone has suggested consuming more raw vegetabale and fresh fruit, so you can get energy from them quickly.    Simply avoid fried and sugary stuff.
8NbpkRpEaa	That's a fast acting anti-anxiety pill. It should work and your lucky to even get em. They can cause nausea though. I'd take one beforehand and see how you feel- break the pill in half the next time if it makes you feel sick. My husband had to do that. They make you sleepy, too. Be careful.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	I would only take half to start. They make you drowsy and very mellow.   If I take it too often I get kind of a hang over where I need a day to sleep it off.

Be very careful if you eat or drink anything! I made the mistake of thinking the numbness was wearing off once I could drink without it dribbling out of my mouth & that I would be fine to eat something if I had control over my tongue & could keep my mouth closed, etc, as long as I was careful. Well, the numbness had not worn off as much as I thought & I chewed the heck out of my lip & never felt a thing! I seriously had it in my mouth chewing on it as if it was part of my food. The only reason I figured something was wrong is because I thought  the piece of 'steak' I was eating was too tough to chew since I couldn't seem to chew it down, and went to spit it out & discovered my lip bleeding. It wasn't the steak after all that was still left in my mouth, it was my lip! So, just eat soft things you don't have to chew (think mashed potatoes, yogurt, etc) until the numbness is COMPLETELY gone! Trust me! My lip was bruised and cut & stayed sore & swollen for days!|`|1807cf398f00d4b18c405eeca8428395aa	1-3 hours :)|`|AA11249047	chew gum it will reduce the time you are numb
TSmZOAVvaa	It is a good start. I would suggest doing Cardio for 30 minutes at least 5 days a week. On weekends i hope you take walks and stay active.    It also depends on the intensity of your workouts.     Just stick to your routine for 3 months along with sensible diet and you'll see amazing results.     The key is to be consistent and not skip any day and also not skip any meal.    Good Luck!!|`|d0sztRa9aa	You're not doing enough cardio. You should try to keep your heart rate up for at least 25-35min. It's good that you're switching it up though, it keeps your muscles confused.     What are you eating? Are you staying away from sugar and white foods?|`|YIs51Vp8aa	the time seems about right.  You may want to up the cardio to 30 minutes total or do 10 - 15 min warm up type cardio on your weight training days and up the weight training to 30 min or so.    You get the best health results when you alternate Cardio and resistance days.  The time you spend in the gym just needs to be very efficient.  The trap of the gym can sometimes be not even realizing how long you rest between exercises or the time it takes to move from exercise to exercise.  Try to up your intensity and move quickly from exercise to exercise.    It is hard to comment much on what success you will have since I am not sure what exercises and intensity you are working at.  But over all you seem to be on the right track!
6d18126e711f352c62adc9c85e6d27ceaa	Pneumonia is pneumonia.  Aspiration just describes what the onset was or how it started.  The aspirated material could start growing bacteria and it cold become bacterial pneumonia.    I have seen near drowning victims who inhaled dirty creek water develop bacterial pneumonia from the aspirated water.|`|ZsCqfPaZaa	Yes.  Aspiration pneumonia just describes a pneumonia that was brought on specificaly by aspiration [which is essentially getting vomit/fluid down the wrong pipe and into one's lungs].
5oNwMqMiaa	Hiya,  I have PCOS but no experience of the implant.  It's a great sign if you have regular periods.  PCOS sounds scary but if affects everyone in varying degrees and the symptoms can get better or worse as time goes on, it's all in your genes.  The best things in my experience that you can do to not aggravate your symptoms are stick to a healthy balanced diet, steer clear of processed foods and alcohol.  Make sure you exercise regularly as well and maintain a healthy weight.  Any birth control methods that you choose should not affect your fertility, but you need to talk to a medical professional about your options.  I have found a link that may help you honey.  Good luck :-)|`|RNNdRHrMaa	Hi there sweetie, as a PCOS sufferer myself, I can understand where you are coming from.    I have never had the implant, but was on the depo injection. It didn't stop me from conceiving my daughter.  You are young sweetie, and it is comforting to know that you are being responsible in the use of contraception.    Fingers crossed for you sweetie|`|KG6AQcmQaa	Heya,  I have PCOS too.  My periods are regular, but they have only just come back regular, i used to have a perioud every other month :S.  But i was a stone overweight, so my consultant told me to loost it, and things should straighten themselves out and they have. For the past 3 months i have come on every month.    I like the other answer have had no experience of the implant. My consultant has never spoken to me about it, im currently on the Dianette pill, due to me having a bit of excess hair through pcos. I dont think this affects my fertilty, as my doctor did not say anything about it, when she put me on the pill.    I have a doctor and a consultant, as i have a hormone imbalance, also due to pcos..!!! Its a nightmare to have it :(. I would suggest talking to your doctor hun, they will know more than we do on here. They know more about your personal case of pcos. So they should be able to guide you with any worries you have.    Good luck!

Happens to med students sometimes. Don't worry about it, you'll be fine.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Fortunately not.

cAu13hbbaa	You could be spotting-- It's pretty much where you have an awkward, short period; usually between two regular periods. In which case the two weeks would match up.     I can't explain the fever and exhaustion though. If symptoms keep up, I really suggest you go to a doctor.    Good luck!!|`|6fjMtWboaa	You need to see your DR.|`|WlywfjG1aa	This kind of problem of irregular period is common at your age.

Ever been to a doctor about it?|`|eLd7RgF2aa	I have this problem when I eat certain foods!!  You might want to keep a food diary for a while, as you wait to see your doctor. You said you have had this problem "for a while" so I assume, not forever. If it is a change for you, then you need to be checked.    This could WELL be why you are not gaining weight. I have this same problem if I eat eggs. Don't know why.  Have you started drinking  a protein drink by chance, or another drink to try and gain weight??  Those are notorious for causing a "dumping syndrome".|`|ZNbauLJzaa	irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, diverticulitis all come to mind, but if this is the norm for you and you are otherwise healthy then that just may be how your body works.  The only way to know for sure is to see your doctor and maybe a GI specialist.|`|04Gvkzx2aa	u have a fast metabolism. its a good thing, not a bad one. u are very lucky.|`|zJHrFBtNaa	This is good and it happens to me most of the time. It happens because your body has good, natural reactions.|`|gNBKvQuMaa	What types of foods are you typically eating and what cooking methods do you use; fast foods, microwave, high temperatures? This is NOT normal nor healthy.How often do you eat fresh raw fruits and veggies with your regular meals? Do you drink Milk,soda, juices,or any other commercial social drinks throughout your day and with your meals? High Fructose Syrup is very good at inducing such traumas to the digestive tract...You might have Crohn's Disease but please do not be alarmed with this nor the others listed by others...Most diseases today are not only PREVENTABLE but ALSO REVERSIBLE!! Changing the types of FOODS and Drinks you consume can have a GREAT impact on eliminating this and helping you to gain weight.See Pasteurized Dairy, believe it or...not is very very unhealthy and can play a big part in growth problems and not gaining weight as well as for others Obesity.If you are like the general public, you likely believe everything you have been taught throughout your entire life which unfortunately includes TV.See all this information has been set up to inform you in what "they" want you to believe,think,eat and act...Sounds silly,maybe,but doesn't the whole idea of GOD sound silly to when theres no proof?If you can think it, it IS REAL.Take every single movie you have ever seen, now consider where that came from?What about UFO's and Aliens etc...?If you go back into REAL history not the crap they teach you in schools because this again is what they want you to think and believe, the health of our people was far greater then what its been over the last ohhh 50 years.From the 60s-late 80s disease as tripled-TRIPLED.Did you know that merely 900,000 people DIE in the USA EVERY year because of Drugs,Medical Drugs amongst this are surgeries and malpractices but this they will not put on Public TV...Y? Health Food Stores carry a great many healthy choices but they also carry many chemically altered and GMO foods too, so one must be educated in making choices for taking back ones health.Organic Detox and Fiber plus Enzymes can be very very helpful and a GREAT start.Email me if you'd like some Real Scientific Facts from those NOT on the GVN'T payroll, let alone some that are or were but were fired because they would not lie to us the people.

That's the correct answer. it takes more calories to run bigger muscles    hope this helps|`|AA11447210	Your metabolism will run faster the more muscle you have. It doesn't necessarily have as much to do with strength, as the amount of muscle in your body. Some people are muscular, but not as strong as you think they'd be.

Have you heard of Bio-oil?  well it works.  Depending on how bad your stretchmarks are, probably buy a 200ml bottle which will cost somewhere around $40 - depending on where you live.  I used that twice a day, everyday and they took about a month to disspear but it sure worked. Just use that or even palmers cocoa butter(apparently that works just as good but I havent tried it). Recently like 10 months later they started to come back, I think I had a growth spurt. But ive used a 60ml bio oil and they went in a week - 2 weeks.  Use bio oil it really works and its so much better without them!!    Goodluck!!!!!!|`|AzFScZ3Kaa	I'm not sure. Isn't there a lotion like coco butter formula that's suppose to dothat or some?

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If I am not wrong, you seem to be trying to conceive, since you had sex on the day that you think she was ovulating.  Usually women will not spot blood because of ovulation.  They may have a strange discharge, which is sort of like egg white, but not blood.  However, there is another circumstance that causes this type of spotting and that is called implantation bleeding.  This is when the egg has already been fertilized, maybe a few days before, and when it attaches to the lining of the uterus, it disturbs the blood and causes that to be expelled as spotting.  If that is the case and her period does not appear in about two weeks, she should take a home pregnancy test first thing one morning, as there are more hormones present in the first urine of the day.    If she is not pregnant and you are trying, she could do the following to check if she is ovulating:    Start taking your temperature every morning BEFORE getting out of bed.  Write it down and the day you are about 2 degrees over your normal, you are probably ovulating if not otherwise ill.  That is the day you want to try to conceive.  Sperm can live in your body for up to 7 days, but try again in 3 days.  Only have intercourse every three days to give his sperm a chance to multiply in numbers and be new.    hope this helps..

Look at it this way they broke their lease when they moved in and smoked even though they weren't supposed to.  You sound like a really good son. Just give your dad some time. As soon as the apartment is rented he will be happy.  Just try to let it go in one ear and out the other this is the way he is and you can't change it. You are the better person for helping the way you are. We can't change our parents. It will soon be over with your help in finding a new tenant.

Take care.|`|AA10898750	He is wrong tell him he can get a huge discount for being smoke free that means all areas including the walks and the car parks and so on no smoking means just that your right and he is wrong and if he has to put money into these apartments after they leave then he should keep their deposits for that remamber the insurance discounts only apply if its smoke free and why doesnt he care careless smoking or an ashtray into a trash can and he loses the whole investment and smokers stain and smell up all the walls and carpets alet alone the burns and stench al;so it covers the oder of drug use and who wants dopers living aroung your family he's a little whack huh

xb255X0faa	Most life insurance companies will ask if you've used any kind of tobacco in the past X months (usually 12 months).  If you explain to them when and why you smoked they make give you the non smoker rate or make you pay the smoker rate for a year, retake the nicotine test and then lower you down to the nonsmoker rate.      I would advise you not to cover it up because I'll guarantee you that life insurance fraud is much worse than being branded a smoker.  Pay the rate you can get now honestly and then after you've been nicotine free for another year then go back and apply for a cheaper rate.  If you need the insurance you don't want to wait because you never know what might happen to you in the next year.|`|AA10287830	You'll be fine.  Tobacco doesn't show up in tests and there's no way for anyone to tell if you are a smoker or not.|`|LlsKvjxcaa	They Absolutely would not be able to tell that you had smoked.  You are considered a non-smoker.  Even if you were a somewhat regular smoker, they would not be able to prove this without extensive exams, which they do not do.  Nicotine leaves the body completely within less than 24 hours.|`|o40a5VMjaa	I am a life insurance broker that compares almost all companies to guarantee the lowest price (insure.com). The fact is that when the paramedic companies complete the physical, they will look for a specific nicotine metabolite called cotinine. Cotinine can stay in your system for up to a month after smoking a cigarette. If it has been less then that, you should either postpone the exam, or purchase a no-exam plan.

Other Pull-up variations include: palms facing each others, thumbless grip, towel Pull-ups, Fat Bar Pull-ups, Mixed Grip Pull-ups, Horizontal Pull-ups, Kipping Pull-ups    Benefits:      * Build Muscle. Pull-ups & Chin-ups force you to lift your own bodyweight. This stresses your body, building the muscles of your arms & back.      * Grappling Strength.

And it's working a completely different set when you do them palms-inward.|`|Y4UhkbOTaa	Basically the wider your grip the higher up your lats are worked. Close grip works your lower lats because you can go up higher so they get more work put on them. just past shoulder width kind of does it all mainly for mid lats though.

It is also often the only symptom that remains after treatment of acute flares. A flare in lupus is an acute increase in symptoms.       Fever during lupus flares is usually low-grade, rarely exceeding 102F. A temperature greater than this should stimulate a search for an infection as the source of the fever. However, any fever in lupus should be considered an infection until proven otherwise.       Muscle pain (myalgia) and joint pain (arthralgia) without or with joint swelling (arthritis) are very common with the new onset of lupus and with subsequent flares.   Although lupus is a multisystem disease, certain organs are affected more commonly than others:    hearing voices is not assoicated with lupus...

This is where the practice of this method helps to generate the normal flow of energy and the body can start healing itself.     Here is another form of energy healing that I think you will find very interesting. Called Pranic Healing and Ive never experienced anything so powerful. Ive helped several people and It took very little time to learn. (pranichealing.com)    Best of health to you    Cheers|`|6e0167225be7b0777c7002a89cefdd09aa	YES, IT WORKS GREAT..........I HAVE HAD IT DONE ON MY FEET.|`|bee213314bc4dc22e1c8b9fd91b2b762aa	Reflexology is the art of working pressure points on the feet or hands that refer to corresponding places in the body.  For example the big toe is the head, you can work the toes to help relieve sinus pressure or the like.  You can work all these points to help relieve symptoms of the internal organs (disease). If someone was having issues with their reproductive system, I would work the ankle because there are points that refer to the ovaries or testes depending on the gender you are working with.  I think it has its merits, I've seen changes in people I have worked with for the good. It's based on chinese medicine/ acupressure points that are over 2000 years old although reflexology is relatively "new" to the alternative medicine field.  I would recommed looking into Reiki if you are interested in learning some pretty interesting techniques for healing.  Chinese medicine and the study of Chi is pretty fascinating if you're looking for a new direction.  Good luck!

68d13f7e388e7e85d5315a6142111ac1aa	Well, there's another type of happy ending: the female orgasm. Also called "coming," climaxing, or having a "big O," an orgasm is often the pleasurable climax during sexual activity.    What is an orgasm? It's defined as the peak of sexual arousal when all the muscles that were tightened during sexual arousal relax, causing a very pleasurable feeling that may involve the whole body. During orgasm, many women's heart rates skyrocket, their breathing quickens, and their blood pressure rates increase; muscles throughout their bodies spasm, but mostly those in the vagina, uterus, anus, and pelvic floor.    Sound dangerous? It isn't. In fact, most women who have had an orgasm will tell you that it's quite nice.    To put it mildly, orgasms feel good. During orgasm, chemicals called endorphins are released into the bloodstream. They cause pleasant sensations to ripple through the body, but they also make many women feel happy, giddy, flushed, warm, or sleepy.    So, how do women have orgasms?    For starters, almost any type of sexual stimulation can lead to orgasm. A woman can have an orgasm through intercourse, oral sex, or anal sex; manual stimulation of the vulva by her partner; body rubbing ("dry humping"); or masturbation. Some women can even have orgasms just by touching their breasts or by fantasizing about sex.    For many women, the contact has to be much more direct  right on the genitals  and in a regular, rhythmic pattern. Stimulation of two major parts of the genitals can cause a woman to have an orgasm: the clitoris (which is a part of the vulva) and the vagina. A woman can have an orgasm through stimulation of just her clitoris, just her vagina, or both. But most women have orgasms through stimulation of the clitoris.    Although some researchers believe there is just one type of female orgasm, others believe that stimulation of these two parts of the genitals can cause different types of orgasm. During a clitoral orgasm, the vagina becomes longer, and it causes a pocket to be formed beneath the uterus. During a vaginal orgasm, the uterus drops lower and shortens the vagina. Stimulation of both the vagina and clitoris can cause a blended orgasm, the third type of orgasm. All these orgasms may feel different from each other.    Here's some more information about vaginal orgasms: there is a particular place inside the vagina called the G-spot (short for the Grafenberg spot, named after the researcher who "discovered" it). It's a small bunch of nerves, about the size of a quarter, that's located about an inch or two inside the vagina on the side closest to the navel. It can become extremely sensitive during sex play. And the G-spot can swell, which may make it easier to find.    Sometimes during stimulation of the G-spot, a clear fluid will spurt out of the urethra. The fluid is similar to that produced by the prostate gland in men that makes up the liquid portion of semen. Yes, it's true  about 10 percent of women can actually ejaculate!    Most women will have one orgasm, and then they'll need to take a long break  stop or reduce sex play  before the next one. But some women can have several in a row  they can have multiple orgasms.    Many women  about one out of three  have trouble reaching orgasm when having sex with a partner. Most women experience orgasm through clitoral stimulation rather than through vaginal penetration. So if a woman is having difficulty reaching orgasm, she may want to try clitoral stimulation during, before, or after vaginal intercourse and oral sex to have an orgasm. Keep in mind, every woman's body responds differently to various kinds of sex play. Each woman has different preferences for the ways in which she likes to be stimulated.    Most women who reach orgasm with a partner have also experienced an orgasm from masturbation. Women who have never had an orgasm may want to try to masturbate and learn what pleases them. It may take some time, but practice makes perfect.    So, now that you're an expert on orgasms, spread the word. The more women and their partners know about orgasms, the easier it will be to have one. Enjoy!|`|9249c05c0891c00e16353a0fc5c21663aa	The ultimate pleasurable experience where the pelvic muscles contract and relax in waves or spasms that last 30-40 seconds.

AA10762368	Keep drinking water.  You do not say what is in the"decent healthy meal."  You need to change it from whatever is making stinky sticky poo.  You can drink all the water in the world but if you are eating something along with the water that is not agreeing with your digestion now that you have lost 60 lbs.  you will still have the mystery of the stinky sticky poo. Poo can get stinnky and sticky regardless of hoe moch water you drink , if what you are eating remains a problem but you have not figured that out yet. You could have eaten something that was not quite right. are ou a meat eater? When meat decays it gets stinky and sticky poo at the other end. If you give your digestive tract a rest and drink juices and water it would help. also to flush out what is giving you sticky stinky poo, add fiber to the liquid that you are drinking. You cann even think to  give yourself just a clear water enema to remove the stinky sticky poo making waste that is already in your colon. Microorganisms that give a person occasion to make stinky sticky poo may improve if you ingest yoghurt containing live acidophyllus baccillus which will bring the healthy bacteria in your intestinal tract back into proper balance and ournumber those that could be contributing to making stinky sticky poo. You also need to make sure that you wash your hands and the fruits and vegetables that could contribute others handlers stinky sticky poo remnants on their hands and in the aresa where the produce is grown and might give you   just enough  to make your poo stinky and sticky poo. You did not complain in your question of having any cramping when you pass this stinky sticky poo, so I am assuming your are not suffering from disease but only aesthetically displeased by the stinky sticky poo that you do complain of....  It will " take a while(, yes,) to get unsticky.... not that smelly and softer....".  I hope that this helps you with your problem!

a08d893d2ceeee2912c17d00508d9922aa	Ok goosebumps or piloerection (pil is from the Latin word for hair). People experience this phenomenon when they are cold or frightened. The hair is able to stand on end due to the contraction of the pili muscles at the base of the hairs. When they are triggered by external stimulus, the tiny muscles become hyperactive and the hair stands up straight. Because humans have very short hairs, our highly visible skin displays many small bumps as the pili muscles contract.    Piloerection as a response to cold or fear is vestigial in humans; as humans retain only very little body hair, the reflex (in humans) now serves no known purpose.  The tiny mucsles are called Arrectores pilorum: Tiny muscles that act as the hair erector muscles. The arrectores pilorum play a key role in goose bumps, a temporary local change in the skin The chain of events leading to this skin change starts with a stimulus such as cold or fear. That stimulus causes a nerve discharge from the sympathetic nervous system, a portion of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. The nerve discharge causes contraction of the arrectores pilorum (the hair erector muscles). Contraction of these muscles elevates the hair follicles above the rest of the skin. And it is these tiny elevations we perceive as goose bumps.    I cant say why you dont get goosebumps it might be that you haven't be exsposed to the right stimuli to create the response or it may be genetic. If you can make sense of the passge below(see second link) it talks about the lack of certain things in one person while they are clearly there in the control subjects. All to do with the nerve ending of the  arrector pili smooth muscles/Arrectores pilorum muscle.    We studied the immunohistochemical expression of laminin subunits f2, f1, g1 in muscle and skin biopsy samples from three patients with congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), and from ten control patients investigated for various neuromuscular disorders. Merosin f2 chain was not detectable in the basement membrane of muscle fibers, or in the nerve endings, cutaneous nerves, and corium in the skin of the CMD patients, whereas it was clearly expressed in the skin biopsy samples from control patients, especially in the nerve endings of the arrector pili muscles. Laminin f1 chain was expressed in the corium, in the muscle fiber membranes of arrector pili muscles and in cutaneous nerve fibers, perineurium and blood vessels in controls and in CMD patients. Laminin g1 chain was faintly expressed in the corium, and a diffuse labeling was detected on arrector pili muscle with enhanced expression at nerve endings, intracutaneous nerves and capillaries, with similar findings in all biopsy specimens. For merosin-negative CMD patients, skin biopsy may provide a diagnostic alternative to muscle biopsy since merosin deficiency can be demonstrated in the skin neural structures, and in particular in the nerve endings of the arrector pili smooth muscles  (I gave up reasearching here as it was beyond me)    Hope you find out why you dont get goosebumps.

f2SaG3HWaa	Hicough is a result of in co ordination between the two dome of diaphragm.Means one dome of diaphragm contracts and the other one do not do that at the same time so as a result of that this hicough starts !The nerve supply of this diaphragm comes from cervical segment of spinal cord from the level of 3rd cervical vertebrae so anything giving pressure or compression to this will make hicough.Gas under the diaphragm ,Kidney disease raised blood urea or acid peptic disease also give rise this !Psychological Shock treatment,or breathing exercise like holding the breath may improve it !Some time patient needs tranquilizer and sedative also to control it .If you are getting it so frequently than go for x ray of cervical spine,outlet of chest for extra cervical rib and also for blood urea ! Than USG abdomen !Take bowel regulator and have meditation ! Or finally go to see your doctor ! Always YouRsmE|`|BT6KCjRyaa	I believe hicups happen with sudden body change of temperatures.  You're probably warm in bed and when you get up is cold....  Try removing your blankets slowly to get your body to room temperature.  Also, if you get them, the best way to get rid of them, is to sit down, bend forward, and drink some water in that position. stay there for a few minutes ....  it always works for me.  good luck hope it helps

EQuuxK4Jaa	there are many ways to work the lower abs, but my favorite and the one that i find works the best is alternating leg lifts.    1. lay on your back with feet straight out.  2. lift feet 6 inches off the ground and lift your head off the   ground to look at your toes. (keep your shoulders on the ground)  3. raise one leg into the air and then bring it back down to six inches off the ground, and repeat with the other.  4. Don't let your feet touch the ground.  5. continue until you cant do any more. (or until you can feel the abs starting to get weak.)    this is a great site with many more exercises.   http://www.myfit.ca/exercisedatabase/sea...    Hope this helps.|`|v6O1GAh6aa	yea there is this one exercise i use to target my lower two abs..  i forgot the name of the work out but it goes like this:  you lay on your back with some one standing perpendicular above the shoulder area facing your feet.   the person must have one foot to each side of you.  then you lift your legs up all the way till   the person helping out pushes them back down.. and they should go back down with out touching the floor and back up again  reps are up to you..|`|OPZoJpSbaa	When I really want to target my lower abs, I use the workout below.

0JXPgQuqaa	First, the Mia Bella candles are very good for overcoming such smells, plus,  you will also be enjoying the Best Performing, Cleanest Burning  Triple Scented Candle!   http://www.gottahavecandles.scent-team.c...     Second, the subject of your stinky feet....Here is some advice from Dr. Oz, who is regularly on the Oprah Show.  I actually know someone who followed his directions below, and had success with it!    http://www.oprah.com/health/oz/oz_200704...    Good Luck with both issues!    Here is Dr. Oz's advice:    Q:  I've tried everything from repeated washing to open-toed shoes, but the smell is still horrible. What can I do about my stinky feet?    A:   It's no surprise that so many people's feet smell. After all, Dr. Oz says, there are a quarter-million sweat glands on your feet. "You can generate about a half a liter of sweat from your foot in a day. It really does make a lot of juice."    But that sweaty foot is not the direct cause of the stink. After all, sweat is sterile. That pungent smell is actually caused by fungus or bacteriasuch as athlete's foot. "Take your shoes off and look to see if you've got a little bit of a pitting on the bottom of your foot, on the sole. The pitting is  almost like little pinholes in the bottom of your foot, and it usually is a little bit white. That's an example of a fungus infection," Dr. Oz says.    So how can you get rid of the bacteria? Dr. Oz's remedy has a cure in the bag. Brew up some mild iced tea and put your feet in it for about 30 minutes a day for a week. "The tannic acid in the tea will actually tan your foot a little bit, which will dry it out," he says. "That's helpful in reducing the amount of sweat, and the odor as well."|`|GoxiAQqFaa	Get a kitty and put the litter box in your office.|`|mLCjfL9Oaa	WHA!HA!HAa! oop's sorry, but i thought your question was so funny!

I'm not sure if you'd want to use one since you're in a labratory though. If you feel it wont ruin your work, feel free to try one!     Make sure if you buy one that is a plug in or something, to make sure it is allergy-friendly.     I used one in my bedroom and it gave me the sniffles. If you dont like that idea, try candles at Yankee Candle or if you like tea, boil some tea and drink it when you're in your office.     I hope I helped!|`|hBkj4YIoaa	Someone said that candles are unsafe, I am not entirely sure that is true.  I would think that if you burn them in an environment you know is safe it would be okay.  I would recommend all natural candles, however, since the toxins released by unnatural wax or scent could react with whatever you are doing.  The plug in electric tart warmer is a great idea but again, you would want to be sure that the tart melts you are putting into your warmer are all natural so they do not release any toxins.  The website I listed below offers all natural products and are great at answering questions.
AA11096432	Well I have done the Master Cleanse as a kick start to my diet. I do it for 2 weeks straight and I lose about 15-25 pounds.     After getting off the diet I change my old eating habits and I KEPT THE WEIGHT OFF!!  I work out at the gym about 3-4 times a week. So the Master Cleanse does work for me.  Here is the receipe.    For a minimum of 10 days, drink:  2 Tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) fresh-squeezed lemon or lime juice (approx. ? lemon),  2 Tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) organic Grade B maple syrup, not maple-flavored sugar syrup or syrup from companies that use formaldehyde to harvest their syrup  1/10 Teaspoon or more cayenne pepper (hot red pepper), and  1 Cup (8 fluid ounces) purified or spring water, NOT fluoridated water.  Drink six to twelve glasses of this lemonade mixture daily. No food is eaten nor any vitamin supplements taken during the cleanse. If you get hungry, have another glass of lemonade. After all, this is also called the "Lemonade Diet."    If you are overweight, you may use less maple syrup. If you are underweight, use more maple syrup if you wish.     Do not vary the amount of lemon juice per glass and be sure to drink at least six glasses of lemonade a day. You can drink more water, if you want.    As a reducing diet it is superior in every way to any other system because it dissolves and eliminates all types of fatty tissue. Fat melts away at the rate of about two pounds a day for most persons-and without any harmful side effects.    Yes, the lemonade diet is a reducing diet, but much more. People build strong, healthy bodies from the correct foods or they build diseased bodies from incorrect foods. When disease does become necessary, the lemonade diet will prove its superior cleansing and building ability.|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	No, it doesn't work.  The ONLY way to lose weight is diet and exercise.  Eat smaller portions, eat healthy foods and get out and exercise every day.  That's it.  There are no potions, supplements, vitamins, herbs, foods, drinks....nothing that is going to make you lose weight and/or burn fat.  It's what I do.  Believe me, if there was something out there that REALLY worked, it would be HUGE, WORLDWIDE news.  Everyone in the world would be talking about it and using it.  It doesn't exist.|`|jR5kvXgeaa	Thats the diet Beyonce followed for a role in Dreamgirls.  Have you seen her now??? She has gained back more than she lost which happens with all fad diets.

N?o conseguia trabalhar e repetidas vezes ficava internado em hospitais psiquitricos. Vendo que todos os demais tratamentos n?o produziam resultados, o neurocirurgi?o Keith Langford fez uma cirurgia, abrindo a cabe?a do homem e colocando-lhe no crebro um marca-passo que opera com bateria. Segundo se informou, esse marca-passo emite um impulso eltrico rtmico que alivia a depress?o, sem prejudicar o crebro nem alterar a faculdade de raciocnio.    Funcionou! O referido senhor voltou a ter uma atitude positiva e retomou seu trabalho. O senhor salvou minha vida, disse ele ao mdico. Agora posso levar uma vida normal.    Esse homem sentia mais do que a tristeza que  normal a pessoa sentir. Ele estava entre os oito milh?es de norte-americanos que anualmente procuram ajuda especializada por depress?o intensa  um distrbio que gera forte sentimento de culpa, de inutilidade e faz encarar o futuro sem esperan?a. Usualmente, h altera??es no apetite e no sono, h constante fadiga, acessos de choro e incapacidade de sentir prazer algum na vida.    Bem poucos casos exigem um tratamento radical com um marca-passo. Em geral, porm, sugere-se, para casos de depress?o intensa, alguma forma de assistncia por profissionais experientes. A estatstica indica que em alguns pases o nmero dos que passam por tal episdio alguma vez na vida chega a ser de cada quatro mulheres uma e 10 por cento dos homens.    Quais os tratamentos disponveis? H uma variedade. Alguns s?o diametralmente opostos no modo de tratar; contudo, outros coincidem em parte. Por que se d isto?    Alguns pesquisadores acham que as depress?es graves s?o causadas por uma disfun??o fsica do organismo (mesmo que seja desencadeada por algum evento que produz tens?o)  um desequilbrio bioqumico do crebro  e, por conseguinte, julga-se que a medica??o seja de suma importancia em sanar tal desequilbrio. Outros argumentam que o distrbio  resultante do modo errado de a pessoa pensar e que a mente gera o desequilbrio, podendo, por conseguinte retific-lo. Tais acreditam que a mente precisa de corre??o atravs da terapia de dilogo, a psicoterapia. H alguma verdade em cada um dos mtodos, mas nenhum dos dois tem a solu??o totalmente.    A Mente e o Corpo Est?o Relacionados     uma quest?o difcil de solucionar, por causa da ntima rela??o existente entre a mente e o corpo. Ambos tm efeitos decisivos um sobre o outro.    As desordens mentais s?o muito complexas e cada paciente  diferente. Portanto, um mdico familiarizado com o paciente pode usualmente fazer recomenda??es quanto ao melhor tipo de tratamento para o paciente. Se o paciente n?o ficar satisfeito, talvez o mdico possa ajud-lo a encontrar outros especialistas. A matria que se segue talvez sirva para ajudar tanto o paciente como o mdico a compreender que h diversos tipos de tratamento disponveis. Nenhuma forma nica de tratamento cura todos os casos de depress?o intensa. Sabe-se, tambm, que, dentro de cada tipo de tratamento, h amide uma grande variedade de especializa??es. Por exemplo, na psicoterapia, h 130 mtodos diferentes de tratamento, segundo se informa. Outrossim, os que usam o mtodo  base de nutri??o podem variar entre pesquisadores proeminentes que tm um cabedal de dcadas de experincia em estudos e os que se tornaram especialistas de fim-de-semana aps terem assistido a um seminrio de dois dias de dura??o.|`|vLPItBswaa	ganhar sozinha na megasena.|`|fb7085e5c7e9aa8b467f3dd8cadf16abaa	sim, existem essas clnicas.  os trabalhos l feitos pelos pacientes, tem como objetivo melhorar a auto-estima...  trabalhos manuais, tirar leite at, cuidar de hortas, cantar, etc, s?o atividades q o deprimido em tratamento pode fazer sem ter que ficar no quarto o dia todo e se interage com outras pessoas q tem o mesmo problema.

RJhNho8Daa	It sounds like you may have strained your pcl (postier cruciate ligament.) Although this injury isn't as common as the others you've experienced it can be a huge pain to deal with, as you can see.   The pcl is the ligament is located behind the acl, and is usually injured when the leg has been pushed back in some way. Though it is not as painful as some other knee injury's this ligament has much to do with stability, and yes, straightening of the joint.   From what you've said, I cant guess if you've only strained the joint, or have actually torn the ligament, as I've done.   You'd best see your doctor, to get a full diagnosis, but be sure to tell him/her exactly how the injury occurred, because pcl injuries can be a less likely suspect than other knee injuries. Best luck!|`|PjGU2UQVaa	yea, your just overdoing it on your knee. at the end of the day try putting one of those pads that get icy cold or hot for your knee. take it easy.|`|f97Et3LYaa	I hurt my knee today too, I can see the bone so I think it might be broken.

Nobody knows when a growth spurt will happen.  They sneak up on you when you're not looking.  There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.

UB5jw2ZHaa	To much blood rushing to your head, try not to hold your breath when you orgasm. Are they strong ones?|`|YsjHpAOgaa	The orgasm maybe?|`|O2s8tLQzaa	Many possibilities, but let's check from nearest we can get.    Check your head cushion or your pillow, probably you lay on them too long before reaching the orgasm. Or probably the pillow was too hard or too soft, and it make your neck/head position in not proper position. Try another position next time, if you get this from missionary position, try with WOT or doggy or standing, check if you have same problem or not.    Taking birth control pills or serum may also cause this too. Consult this with your doctor.    Think about having body-exercise, it will help your blood to adapt for better respiratory cycle, so they won't rush sending oxygen to your brain, for such exploding occasion, the orgasm.     Have a good sleep, try avoid stress by having holiday or go shopping, have a good meal order in a day, consume more zinc substrate, it's good for Hb in blood.     Have sex too long in one day, without a good stamina is also the procreation.     Well, if you're still doubt about it, please consult your doctor. Check also your family history, should if any disease or complain.|`|COtoLFxEaa	put extra padding on the headboard.|`|AA11478827	A "headache" is an inflammation in the brain. So, most likely your not getting an actual headache but a muscle ache in your neck and the back of your head because your muscles get tense and rigid during an orgasm. So try relaxing your neck and back muscles before having an orgasm. Or just do exercises that strengthen these muscles so they won't spaz out afterward s.

AA10083573	I agree with Nuclearbomb...physical exercise is the best way to get rid of agression of any kind. Go out for a jog; install a punching bag and go a few rounds with it; go for a bike ride; do jumping jacks...anything that will make you tired, yet get out your irritation at the person you wanna smack. If you can't do that, then get on the computer and write all the nasty stuff you wanna tell them, then hit delete. It might take you a few hours, but by then, you'll wonder why you gave that idiot so much power over you, so that you just wasted several hours of your life trash talking them to your computer screen. That's what you do when you get so angry at someone. You allow them to have power over you. No one can really "make" you angry. Anger is a choice, otherwise how can some people just walk away. It's not to say you don't get irritated with them. But it's what you do with that irritation that's the key. The way I look at it, if someone is getting in my face, I can choose a few different routes. The easiest would be to slap the snot out of them. That's not the most constructive though. What I do is to listen to their rant, allowing them to vent themselves. Then I consider all they're saying, whether it's true or not. I also take into consideration that they might not have all their facts either, and may just be believing something someone else told them. There's several factors to look at when someone it telling you off. In even the nastiest confrontation, there's always a little bit of truth, even if they're calling your everything except a human. Sometimes we don't always see ourselves as others do. There might be something we do that ticks people off too, so thinking about the reasons behind their irritation is a good way to examine yourself, and how you come across to others. That's called maturity...seeing things from a different point of view, then accepting your responsibility in it. That's not to say I like being told off...no one does. It's all in how you react to what they're saying that shows the level of your maturity. Some people just like to say stuff to see if they can jerk your chain and see if you react. And they're rarely disappointed. Just once, after someone gets up in your face, let them say all they wanna say, without interrupting them. Stay silent throughout their rant, keeping your face calm and your eyes on their eyes. After they're done, ask them if they're done. If not, tell them to continue please. When they're completely done abusing your ears, tell them that you're sorry they feel that way, adding "I'll have to think about all you've said". Then walk away, holding your anger in until you can get to your punching bag or take that long bike ride. Getting in their face won't solve your problem...in fact, it will make things worse. You've got to think of ways that will keep you out of trouble, and make you grow in maturity. It doesn't take a whole lot of smarts to punch someone's lights out, does it? A thinking person walks away, and finds a different way to release their feelings. That's all that anger is, is a feeling. It's no different than love, lonliness, happiness, or any other feeling. How do you control all of those feelings? If you're lonely, you find a way to fill that void. Happiness can lead to trouble if you don't learn to put it in its proper perspective too, such as bragging about a special award so much that the only one who's happy is you. It's hard to think that positive emotions can become negative, but that's what can happen if you allow it to take over your life. It takes practice, patience, and determination. If practiced long enough, it will get easier to do. Unfortunately, idiots will always cross your path, throughout your life. I'll guarantee that you'll have morons for employers, co-workers, neighbors, and others who will come into and out of your life. There's no guarantee that any one thing will work for you. But one thing that won't work is giving in to your rage. It IS controllable.     Edit: I forgot...something that also works for me is to listen to really loud music, and singing at the top of my lungs until I get hoarse. Whatever songs "do it" for you will work. That also works for some of those other emotions too, like lonliness and boredom too. |`|AA11478827	Mental aggressiveness is best relived by physical aggressiveness.

I get so angry when i think about him/her. I just glad that i don't act out on my emotions. I am slowly learning how to calm down and I know i've improved much better than before. It's better  to behave like a lady with confidence and grace and not be easily provoked.  I know i'd be ashamed of myself in the long term afterwards if i did hurt anyone even if it might feel good temporarily.    I'd spend less time with that person. Make yourself unavailable to interact with him or her. Chances are that the person just doesn't understand how irritating he/she is!!! Better to stay away because out of sight, out of mind.    Tend to your own immediate stressful problems instead of that person. You can't attend to both at the same time because you'll just go crazy or you might blame it all on that person when it has nothing to do that person.

zUkviN4Taa	Usually when you get immunizations what you are actually is getting small doses of the actually disease. Usually it is so small or dead that it does not attack your body full scale but the body does see it as a foreign  substance and will attack it and produce antibodies against it.   Antibodies are virus specific meaning they will be able to fight off that particular disease only.   For example each time you get a cold it is actually a different strain of the virus...you will never get that particular cold again because your body has made antibodies against it. But you will get other colds because they are all different strains n more strains are mutated each year. |`|b5967ca857f7884cd76dbcc8b85a5652aa	when u take a vaccine u r actually injected with a small quantity of the antigen either in the dead or attenuated form,as a result ur body develops resistance to it,only and only to that antigen not anyone else|`|vzdmQxe8aa	Because the vaccine is actually only a small amount of the disease they are trying to protect you from.

As to boys liking you only for your body, well, in the real world that's kinda up to you too.  It really depends how much of your body they get to see and how close you let them get to it.

Maybe they seem big because you have a small chest and body relative to your breast size. I started growing breasts when I was ten. I used to be the only one with breasts in my class. I was so uncomfortable ad unhappy. The worst thing was I was also very skinny and they were too big for by chest, people noticed and started making comments about them. I used to hate them a lot. Now at 21 my breasts are perfect. They are the right size for my chest. I started to grow wide... well you know how women grow wider, they start to have hips and curves, that sort of thing. I am not really curvy, still thin, but my body size and shape change such that now I got a guy say to me last week that I have a very beautiful cleavage. Ok! That's besides the point. Point is your breasts are likely to change, so wait and see they are only young and will grow through a whole lot of stages! Good luck! Please learn to love your body as it is!!!!

As person with experience in sexual psychology I would advice you to contact some sex centre and talk to them about your problem, or to your GP or to parents so you can be directed to specialist.  Thing is , that hate of your body might have negative influence on your development and relationships with people.    It is possible that your parents have enough knowledge to help you to deal with it, but as you posted question here I assume that they do not know how to deal with such matters.     Right now your friends have smaller breasts than you, especially guys ;) but most of girls too. So now it might be strange for your friends to accept this. Your teacher should lecture students about hormonal changes in female body so they find it normal.     When you get 16 years old the guys will find it more sexy than funny, so believe me, older guys probably look at you and find you attractive.    It is good to have big breasts for woman:)    good luck:)    if you have more questions please feel free to ask.|`|VDWcnsIQaa	For having trouble finding clothes that fit both your bust and rest of your torso, I would suggest buying clothes that fit your bust well and then find someone who can sew and do some basic alterations for the waist and things. It doesnt necessarily have to be a professional seamstress. Its easier to alter clothes that fit well at the bust but not so well for the rest; than fitting well for everything except bust. With time you will learn which styles suit your figure and look good.

Come?ar a fazer o sexo sem a camisinha e depois colocar  um risco pois pode engravidar sim (sei que  muito melhor sem, mas ruin mesmo e ter um filho sem na hora errada ou pegar um DST). Sugiro que ao inves de fazer a penetra??o sem a camisinha fa?a mais preliminares.. beijos (ajudam a lubrificar tambem) e carinhos.. e so penetre com a camisinha. Caso tenha um parceiro fixo fa?a exames (voc e ele "DST") e procure um medico para que te indique o melhor anti-concepcional ao seu corpo (pela amor de deus nao tome aquele da sua amiga que  bom.. aquele  bom pra ela.. voc  outra pessoa). espero te ajudado !|`|FSqAk6ryaa	possivel at , mais  uma chance em um milh?o. pois a quantidade de esperma que sai nesse liquido  consideravelmente muito pequena.  por essa quantidade ser pequena,  quase impossivel deles chegarem at vulo, mas claro pode acontecer. mas as chances s?o minimas.  mas se vc toma anticoncepcional, as chances de vc engravidar desse jeito ser quase nenhuma. e se acaso acontecer, ser realmente uma raridade.  tome cuidado com a aids, lembre-se que uma pessoa pode ter aids, e nem saber que tem. fa?a sempre o exame pra saber, n?o fique na duvida.
0TGpz08paa	It may of been a one time thing or it may happen again. Anxiety medications really do help and if you need them , you should take them. I am 22 and one day my heart was hurting so badly, My chest was tightening and I had trouble breathing, I literally thought I was having a heart attack. I called 9-1-1 and I was taken to the hospital and it was all from anxiety. My anxiety was literally making me sick. Try to take care of your health and try to relax because anxiety can really make you physically sick. Take care of yourself|`|39x9tNJzaa	I had a panic attack today too. Twinsies!|`|3XjW8hW5aa	Sooooo what is your question? haha|`|QRG2L5Qjaa	You should get meds. Meds are cool. If you've never experience anything like this, it probably is just 1 time thing. If it happens again, you definetly have a problem.|`|bFKjV7U5aa	Hey now, I work on an ambulance and I think its tons of fun! Okay, okay, I'm sure its not fun if you are actually the patient.    It could have been a one time episode, but it might happen again. There really isn't much you can do to predict if it will happen again. Just know that panic attacks are scary, but they don't last long. They also can be treated with medication.|`|pCkAAIpxaa	I've had a few, but I do have some anxiety problems.  I think it is very strange how it came out of the blue like that.  Were you nervous about something?  Cause whenever I've had one I was nervous and *then* it just kind of escalated by itself.  So sorry about your day! Must've sucked :(|`|fCB7TTBCaa	Hey, panic attacks are definitely not fun. But hopefully it is a one time thing. Also, being a teen there are a lot more triggers to cause them so even if they do occur again many grow out of an anxiety issue. Best advice is what you've given yourself, life definitely is precious. So be positive and maybe even look into some meditation or other self therapy. Far stronger than anything a doctor can prescribe. Good luck.|`|e2XccUvBaa	this happened to me about a year ago, and i havent been the same since because my mom didnt think i need help but i truely did.  im still nervous all the time.  please get help dont be like me
K7x1RHVFaa	Start a dream diary and write down all your nightmares as best you can remember them to work through them, to see them for all they were, and to remind yourself why exactly they scared you.    My guess is you are dealing with a great many issues on mortality and relationships and each night is different because each relationship is different and yet the same.     Your subconscious is working its way around the event and images and words you are trying to avoid. Eventually you will stop having these dreams but until then the journal will help you to figure out what is bothering you. You can share it with your therapist and perhaps they will see the thread more clearly than you. Of course it is you that needs to see the thread or not. If you never see it you will never miss it but it will be there until you do, like a detour in the road, you will simply turn left or right at the sign and avoid whatever is bothering you.    Hope this helped.    Good Luck.
IiqJt0IMaa	no, it's not OCD  if it sounds like OCD to you, do some research on OCD  i'm a psychology major at the moment and my specialty is OCD|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	I mean yeah it does sound like OCD do those intrusive thoughts cause anxiety? O & please don't listen to the ppl above me because you do not have to act upon your unwanted thoughts for it not to be OCD just because you have irrational thoughts but don't act upon them does not mean it isn't I don't know you personally but by the info presented I would have to agree with you but my best suggestion is see a professional adviser|`|uL1hsu1Naa	Either OCD or jst picky|`|85gJHDbNaa	You don't have OCD. You're just picky and have a lot of random thoughts.    OCD means you HAVE to do something or you feel uncomfortable or nervous and can't concentrate on anything other than those negative feelings until you do that certain thing. Like having to check every single room in your house for monsters, or you can't leave the house without touching every single surface on your way out. It's a very damaging condition|`|fCB7TTBCaa	We all have our little obsessions and whatnot. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is far more serious than a few ticks here and there. I also realize how frustrating it may be for someone to tell you that "you're fiine" But you don't want to have a disorder. Talking to a professional is you're best bet for some closure. Self-diagnosis will cause you to further the issues. Maybe get into some art. Create something with those images in your head or even with the energy from anxiety, it surely helps me when i get all bunched up.
WXExyAlWaa	Trust issues, closing off from people, excessive sexual behaviour (if I'm casual about sex it won't have been as bad), lack of sexual behaviour (I don't want anyone to touch me like that again), denial, shame, anger, drinking and drug use...|`|ParFJxnSaa	Blaming herself, suppression of memory, are some. See sexual abuse; minors, in section 20, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris|`|TdqeC0vmaa	Do you mean at the time. or to deal with it later?    Disassociation occurs frequently to children who have been sexually abused. If the abuse goes on for a long time without ceasing the dissociation can become severe enough to lead to DID.    Memories can be suppressed.     Coping with it at the time - children tend to act out behaviorally or sexually. They can be inappropriately clingy to men. Overly emotionally clingy needy of others especially adults. They may become silent and reclusive.     In older women to cope later they may act out sexually abstain from sexuality abuse themselves via self harm etc. Drug and alcohol use. Eating disorders. All normal but unhealthy ways of coping.
hdtNLIIwaa	your mind works like a muscle: the more you use it, the stronger it gets.  if you want to improve your memory, exercise it.  start trying to remember license plates numbers.  watch jeopardy and try to remember the answers by applying them to something you can relate to.  read books.  People say "i feel like if i try to remember too many things, i'll forget other things."  that's not true, the brain is capable of things we don't even know and we only use a tiny percentage of it.  if you apply yourself, your memory can be excellent.    eating peanut butter and chocolate also stimulate the brain.  also, ginkgo biloba is often used to improve memory; but check with your doctor before taking it as it can have several severe drug reactions if you're taking other specific medications.|`|yNvA3Wreaa	Maybe construct a memory palace:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_l... , http://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Memory-Pa...  Memory palaces can be large and ornate, but if you just have a few things you need to remember it can be just one room, or even just one shelf or drawer.  You have to link the idea you need to remember with an imagined object, then place that object in a position in your memory palace.  If you need to remember things sequentially, place the imaginary objects on a path through your room or palace.  When you recall the imagined object, it makes it easier to retrieve the original idea you want to remember.|`|ulzBv4w1aa	eat a healthy breakfast in the morning|`|zJzUjYeTaa	Get 8 hours of sleep every night.

ZpltzTIfaa	If you look at your throat and it has white patches on it, it is possible that you have strep throat.  You can only be sure if you go to the doctor and get a strep culture.  You may also have a fever, body aches, chills.  If you have strep throat you should stay home until you have been on antibiotics for 2 days as it is very contaigious.

Do you WANT to die? This can kill you not to mention it isn't very attractive. If you want to lose weight then do it the right way and exercise.|`|ffJfKTrHaa	You need help alright.  You need someone to set you straight on how bad that is for you.  You must know, if you know anything at all about "bulimia," that it's a devastating disease.  You need to do a little research on this before you "decide" to become anything.  This isn't some game that you can expect to get some sympathy or attention for playing.  It's serious business.  People die from eating disorders and you want it like it's the latest summer fashion you want to try on.  You are just a kid.  Do you really want to have the enamel eaten off your teeth from the gastric fluids?  Whatever.  You need to educate yourself and stop asking for something so sad.  Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it.    I'm sorry to be so harsh, but you really must wise up and realize what you're asking for.|`|3b5756f678ae58231133ed532fe66616aa	Why do you want to have a mental disorder?

Okay so quick science lesson.  (p.s i might not get everything exact but close enough)  After your tummy grinds up all the food and ect,  everything in your tummy is gross,haha of course  but it has some body acid in it. so when you throw up the  stomach acid goes up your throat. So if you throw up  everyday for 2 years,well your throat may need to be treated,  like medicine or something.like i said i didnt get everything exact.  but thats basiclly what happens.  i truley think it be sorta fun(haha) to be bulemic too.  but throwin up is so f*cking gross.  oh and p.s if you do do the whole bulemic thing,  DO NOT EAT RICE before throwing up,  i ate rice,threw up,and YUCK! i had rice stuck in the  middle of my throat for 1 whole day.drinking,eating  does not work too haha.|`|ldc75vYpaa	thats dispicable. not to mention disgusting|`|Jai6UUE8aa	Okay i'm going to say a couple of things but i promise you i will answer your question.  One: normally people are born bulimic it just is trigger by certain things. i am actually fifteen and have been bulimic for four years, i am now seventy five pounds and five foot 4 so thats not good. But the only reason i will help you is because i don't know. i guess i just will    One Way: pencil back of the throat even when you gag keep going, it will work after all this nasty mucus stuff is out of there  Second way: syrup of ipecac   Third Way: watch something that makes you sick, drink salt water|`|9BlCaQkhaa	You may want to become familiar with the English language first.|`|Qq6Xo7ADaa	DO NOT do that    are you stupid?  no that's a stupid question..      the answer is YES!!    go on a diet d*mn..not f*ckin bulemic..|`|jW7yhMvwaa	why bolemic ?   why not anorexic?  why not dead .  what a question .   if at frist u dont succeed try and try again .   do u just want to throw up or do u want to be full blown bulemic ?  u can die .|`|Q0g7pahTaa	That's a very unhealthy habit, but I'll help you-I guess-, since this is Yahoo!

Eat a tube of toothpaste  2.Drink salt water  3.Touch something (ex. pencil, toothbrush, etc.) to your uvula, and don't stop when you gag, wait until you actually puke.  4.Look at/Smell something really disgusting, something that makes you want to throw up.  5.Eat rotten food     Again, please don't get hooked on this, it could kill you. And it's not healthy. I'm sorry, you may be pro-ano, but anorexics look...ugh. Gross. (don't be offended, that was just personal opinion)|`|qBjfyvWOaa	ok im 14 as well and i make myself throw up as well and when u first start all you'll get is that clear stuff..but take a toothbrush (i keep 1 n my purse just n case) and stick it down u throat till u gag after that move it back and forth n ur throat...that should git it up do it till u get as much up as u want!
K7x1RHVFaa	I think the term you are looking for is avoidance. Sleep is simply the mechanism used to avoid what the person is stressed out by.|`|mZDTQZR2aa	Atypical depression is clinical depression where you sleep too much instead of too little
On3DZ6d2aa	I know you didn't ask a question but you are reaching out and that's a step in the right direction! It would seem that you have educated yourself on the pros and cons of every thing that's going on with you. Now you need to learn what to do with all these awful things that you're feeling and not feeling.   You said that you see your dr every 3 weeks or so due to a distance hardship and I can truly understand that. Have you ever thought of asking your dr for the name of a therapist in your area that could work in conjunction with the two of you?  Another idea would be for you to call your local crisis line. I think that even hearing a caring voice on the phone would be better than being alone with your own dark thoughts when they are troubling you the most.  And lastly,sweetheart, suicide is a permanent solution to what amounts to a very fixable, temporary problem...a very dark solution at that.  Give your dr a call and see if something can't be set up over the phone to start with and then go from there. And the key word there is start. He (or she) who makes the most noise and asks the most questions gets the most attention and  the most answers and in all those answers that you'll be getting there are bound to be a few that seem tailor-made just for you! Good luck, honey, you will be in my thoughts and prayers!|`|wtzrQXYoaa	Well at least your family cared for you while I'm struggling to make it to my second chance, if every fails I might as well be a suicide. Yep that's right, I have a little dignity left now and once it is gone it'll go with my life too. Just like vid games with time, even though you have life you must make it before it ends.  Too bad I've suffered enough in this world, even my psychologist said I'm on my own now because that's life, "you're on your own and no one will ever notice you"(That's from me that I see this world as). My parents hate me being the most useless **** that have ever happened to them. And I won't live on the streets, because I can't stand the lowest point of the life. Might as well go to another realm to find new life or live in a area alone for ever because I have autism characteristics myself.  What am I doing atm? I'm working trying to save some money so that I can buy the stuff that I always dreamed about before my very last life.    I hope you have a better life than I do. And I know my time is going out fast.|`|rhApUTdBaa	sounds like you have serious issues.|`|exkKg6hraa	if writing makes you feel better then keep doing it.............  but keep in mind that's not always the case just because it feels good doesn't mean you should do it you........... know what i mean.|`|UVdviQMPaa	A quarter of people end up as outsiders in life and soon depression takes a toll of many males and a few females.

7P3TSjaZaa	Well considering the econonomy, the lack of jobs and the value of education. I will say yes. I just lost my job and i have been lookin everywhere for a new one. If you are in school now stay there. I dropped out in 10th grade. Now I cant get a job making 6 dollars an hour. It is much more stressful though if that answers your question.|`|SErhF1OSaa	I would say that they are about the same really.  When I was growing up, I was being molested by my dad=stress, during high school times too; My grades were good, however, I skipped school all the time, and experimented with drugs and alcohol, getting caught of course added more stress.  Problems with b/fs and g/fs, wearing the 'right' clothes and shoes was very big in the 80's.  I also had 2 jobs through high school, and got my first stomach ulcer and gray hair at 17.  WHEW  College, I was married with 2 kids by the time I went to college, because my parents wouldn't help me pay for it yet they helped my brothers(yea long story).  So I not only had school stress, but home and money and family stress. Then my Grandma died, 2yrs later my mom(only 46).  Now, 15yrs later....I have still 4 kids 20(pregnant), 18(dating girl with 1yr baby), 13, and 12.  Economy sucks, however, we are very lucky...I take in a few kids now, and my husband has a recession-proof job.    The stress we pack on all the stages of our lives, is the most stressful time, each stage of our lives.   The stressors are different, but the stress affects us the same each time.    Momma P|`|oTJ9OKfUaa	lkjg|`|hiY7CCc7aa	I think it's a mixture of the two  Somedays I feel that life was easier when I was yonger then I think of what happened and how people treated me then I think I'm better off now
On3DZ6d2aa	On the up side...good for you for getting out of the house and away from your computer and actually socializing with real people and not just cyberpals. Besides, it's winter and you could have a little case of what used to be called cabin fever and the cure for that is to get out as much as you need to.  The only "downside" I can see is that you might get a little claustrophobic from time to time but the way that you wrote  what you wrote I didn't get that panicky feeling from your writing.   The important thing is what you feel. If this need is causing trauma in your life then you should think about talking to someone if only to find out that you are perfectly normal after all.  You just might have a zeal and zest for life that is to big to contain within the confines of the walls of your home! And that, my friend, is a good thing!|`|7P3TSjaZaa	No they are just obbsessive if this is like your mom or someone its typical my mom used to clean and clean and clean cnstantly.

FAzua6k7aa	Potatoes, rice, pasta, cereal, potato chips, pretzels, cookies usually anything with flour in it. Good dieting tips, eat less fat and exercise. Of course if you have health issues you should speak to your doctor. Even running in place for 3 minutes, picking up your legs (bending them up) for a count of 25 is exercise, do each leg. Take your leg and move it out to the side for a count of 25 while standing up straight is exercise, granted it's not sweaty exercise but you are using your muscles. When you feel it's time to move up the   of times you do it, do it. Stepping up on a stair (meaning up with the right then bring up the left down with the right and then down with the left) the same stair for a count of 25, do both legs- start off first with the right then start with the left so you are actually doing it 50 times. You will feel it it's great for your legs and buttocks, if you bend your arms and move them back and forth that's burning more calories. If you have cable watch Denise Austin workout she is the best not too hard and not too easy, she looks so awkward you won't feel a bit strange doing it either =) Sometimes I kinda laugh at her while I am exercising to her but she does have my complete respect, she is like 50 now with kids and looks great! BTW I got into shape after having my twins with her, I weighed 170 lbs with the twins and was in my pre-prego pants within 3 1/2 months. I lost like 70 lbs.

Things made with flour are broken down quickly by the body so you feel hungry sooner, and your blood sugar spikes more.  If you eat whole grains, your body doesnt process them as fast, so you dont feel hungry so quickly, and your blood sugar doesnt spike as high.  Starches are good energy for the body, but you should avoid the very processed ones when possible.      Try taking a cracker and chewing it up......and just keep chewing it for a little bit, dont swallow as soon as you normally would......it will start to taste sweet.  Just shows you how quickly your body can break down thos starches into sugar.|`|AA10343094	products made with flour or corn starch. like bread, tortillas, pasta and toasted o's (and other cereals like them). other foods, that i can think of, potatoes, rice, oatmeal, cornmeal, carrots, sweet potatoes, beets, pumpkins, squash, bananas, applesauce and corn..but let me do some more reseach, and i'm sure ill find you some more!|`|If2ww2i9aa	Bread.duh.lol.|`|BWCv68QOaa	Potatoes  Rice  Pasta?
AA11305474	I did exactly that and it worked fine.  The only thing is that it is a little bit of a mess to clean it out because it has a solid consistency.  Another thing that works is camphophenique in the liquid form or eucalyptus oil.  But, nothing happened bad when I've put the vapo rub into the chamber it just doesn't really mix with the water like the liquid does.
ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	no, you aren't being cautious, you are being stupid... and if his ejaculant dripped anywhere near your vagina, yeah, you can get pregnant, sperm swims kiddo.  Stop playing russian roulette and make him either use a rag or a condom.|`|FD8I4zthaa	Those sperm are mighty stealthy! Evolution has made sperm very crafty.|`|GKJEgidzaa	Only if the semen actually went in and around your... hmm...entrance.

I've been there and I just worried about it for ages).|`|6qsocyK3aa	Basically, if any sperm touched the vagina, even the outer bit of it, there's a risk. Even if he touched it before he "finished" there's still a risk because he'll have had pre-*** which contains sperm. So you need to think back - was there any penis-to-vagina contact at any point? If there was, there is a risk.|`|dmxnblomaa	No hun you, and if you have to ask this question you shouldn't even be thinking about sex. Please do more research on intercourse befor having sex.

It is not impossible at all. There are plenty of documented cases.   You should have used a douche.( I hope you know what a douche is  - no it is not  a shower.)

I did say almost.|`|RZKygoPzaa	Well I know that yhou must be aware that its about the sperm swimming up stream and making contact with your egg when the egg is fertile.  Just to be on the safe side, buy one of those over the counter pregnancy tests.  Most likely you are safe, but give yourself some piece of mind.  Remember the pregnancy tests are not 100% either but are a very good indication.    In the old days you had to wait and see if you were pregnant.  Now you do not.  Oh, just remembered, there is a product out now that is available at Drug Stores called 'Plan B.'  It is a morniing after pill. Google 'Plan B'  on the Internet.|`|JU351q6Naa	even if your hymen is still intact you could be pregnant yes. A hymen has small tiny holes in it which allows blood to come out when you have a period. It is very possible that if he finished off near you vagina some of his sperm could have got thorugh those little holes in you hymen and started to travel upwards towards the egg. it is worth taking a pregnancy test in a couple of weeks to just make sure. bye the way please not he should be using a condom if he is getting that close to you even if you are not having full sexual intercourse.|`|rpqHLJGGaa	Not unless your name is mary and he`s called Joseph aaargh ffs|`|hfqUp1IBaa	yes,  semen can swim and find it's way up there if he got any on your vagina.

Yes, you can become pregnant even without your hymen breaking.|`|f928e3cad3484f1f3f9be672b00258d9aa	Pregnancy can happen when ejaculate or pre-ejaculate gets in the vagina or on the vulva. Usually, this happens from unprotected vaginal intercourse.    It may also happen if partners have another kind of sex play that puts ejaculate or pre-ejaculate in contact with the vagina or vulva  for example, if partners have ejaculate or pre-ejaculate on their hands and they touch the vagina or vulva.    Ejaculate is produced by the prostate gland and the seminal vesicles. It contains sperm that is produced by the testes. Pre-ejaculate, which leaks from the penis before ejaculation, is produced by the Cowper's glands. It does not contain sperm that cause pregnancy. However, as it moves through the urethra, it can pick up sperm from a previous ejaculation, which might cause pregnancy.    So, it's best to keep both ejaculate and pre-ejaculate away from the vagina and vulva to prevent pregnancy.    Hope this information helps!    Take care,|`|mVPG5xIuaa	don't worry, you are very likely not pregnant.  find out when your next period is due just to be safe,    you're good to be cautious :)
lN9jcKYhaa	1. run at your own pace and start out slow.    2. make sure you stretch, but not too much.    start out by jumping up and down to get the blood flowing and when you feel warm then you should start. also you can start by breathing heavy and fast kind of like hyperventilating before you run to get oxygen going.    3. drink water to be hydrated, but not a lot that will make you full.    4. just dont stop running and push yourself to keep your body moving.    5. after a while of running you won't be that tired anymore (runner's high)    6. wear some good running shoes. i like the nike air max 180s they wont make you tired and dont hurt your feet. they also feel like you are slightly bouncing when you run so your feet dont hit the ground as hard.    7. wear light clothing.    8. listen to some music to keep your mind off of the running and you will end up not being as tired.    9. just run until you are actually tired. if you stop and walk then you will feel more tired when you start again.    10. start a breathing pattern where you get an even amount of oxygen in and out. its better to keep a pattern going between your pace of breathing and pace of running. there is no need to speed up if you are going your own pace. if you do speed up, either breathe faster or breathe deeper, probably deeper.|`|oXf5Ir5Uaa	start out with only a couple of blocks and then work your way up   dont try to do to much|`|gqvvXknQaa	First - Get yourself a good pair of running shoes!     Second - Get an upbeat playlist on your iPod    Three - Start slow. Go with a simple jog first, then switch to running for a few minutes, then back to running. Switch it up until you can feel comfortable with running at a regular basis.     Have fun!|`|OySU2oAkaa	I would definitely recommend starting off with basic cardio in your home before you actually begin running. Doing jumping jacks and pushups and ski jumps for 20 minutes a day or some aerobics and then yoga/pilates 3 times a week will help stretch you out and get you into the program.    Then, after 2-3 weeks, you should ease into running. Start off with running for 20 minutes a day. Start off walking for 3 at a brisk pace and stop to stretch. Then jog lightly but sprint the last minute. After you run, walk it out for 5. Then stretch. Continue doing this for a week and as grow more and more comfortable definitely tack on time or increase your pace.    Hope that helps! For more advice check out http://i-dietandfitness.com|`|6sPcYQr0aa	If you don't feel like you are killing yourself you aren't working hard enough. Just try and try again. I hate running but I do it anyway.   Try to change it up a bit, run sprints on one day, then on the next run distance and more importantly timed. A 30 minute run or other cardio workout, is the average amount of time it takes to deplete your immediate fuel source(simple sugars...), then all the cardio work after 30 minutes is usually burning your reserve fuel source, (FAT).|`|5sIPEujsaa	water|`|Yw8X1aXsaa	make sure to stretch before and maybe start out with running for 3min. and then walking for 1min|`|TTogBTYxaa	Lots of sleep :)  Dont forget to shower after lol|`|AA12182074	Intervals.

Ddw87Jg0aa	Your face it starts from the top and works it way down ,if you`re carrying a great amount of fat in certain areas then you have to target these areas more frequent.to be balance|`|IuOxDlzCaa	my personal trainer told me that ts dfferent with everyone. and that eventually weight will go from everywhere. its just when you start to actually burn off fat you dont know where it will go from first!|`|0II2e6I9aa	Actually, the very first place where you lose weight is within your liver.  During times of plenty (having enough to eat) your liver stores a reserve of calories in a compound called glycogen.  Your liver can store several pounds of this "famine" fuel, and is the first burned during dieting or starvation.  The next thing you lose is excess water from all over your body.  Then the fat starts to burn.  Where it comes from is individual, based on your body type and your genetics.  There is no other set rule as to which body part or area loses weight first, second, fastest or slowest.  Good luck in your weight control plan.|`|CDnmuX1Jaa	My big azz head :||`|twVyisGnaa	I'm not really sure.  It all depends on what type of exercises you do and what areas you're working on.

Or should I say, the part of the body that you want others to pay attention to.

f551e387a3e6f01af266f4af899c09e9aa	Everyone is going to tell you "no" but I actually had heard on the news not that long ago that men who "did not use it" much later in life were much more prone to ED.  If you can't get the "real thing" you can still simulate it by taking matter into your own hands.  I guess the brain probably figures "if this is an unused muscle, then it is a useless muscle" and limits the blood flow there.
hdtNLIIwaa	i've been using the nuva ring for about a year now and haven't gained any weight related to it (that i know of).  however, i've also used the patch, and the ortho evra pill as well as the ortho tri cyclen pill and haven't gained any weight on them either.    the nuva ring is great for convenience since you dont have to remember to take a pill every day, and less annoying than the patch, which always came off around the edges and would stick to clothes.    it has had some minor negative effects on me (decreased libido, increased "wettness") but i can't decide between that and how freakin convenient it is.  i would recommend it|`|gWYArJ0Haa	I have used it, it works well and has the lowest amount of horomones going into your body so it will have the mildest effect of decreased libido.. i was always worried that it would fall out during sex.. thats the only down fall|`|yxxVSzjDaa	My best friend had the NuvaRing and got pregnant while on it!

My boyfriend still brings it up as the worst months of his life. Plus, I gained a little weight. I am very thin and I never gain weight, no matter what, but when I was using the NuvaRing I gained about 5 or 6 pounds, which may not sound like a lot, but it is a lot for me. From what I've heard, a lot of girls gain weight using the NuvaRing and the low sex drive is a very common complaint as well. I would strongly advise against it.

TdqeC0vmaa	the voice of anorexics isn't an actual voice like an auditory hallucination in schizophrenia for example.    Its more like a gut instinct or guilty conscience feeling that many with Anorexia feel so strongly that they ascribe it its own voice personality and even name at times.    So yes they all do. But they may or may not call it a voice.   Its just like that feeling that makes you guilty when you've done something mean or wrong or when you tell yourself "your stupid"     But for anorexics those feelings and thoughts surround eating weight control and self worth.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	When I was anorexic many years ago, I always felt fat and I had to lose more weight. It is a sickness that's hard to overcome because we had geared programed ourselves to be afraid of being fat. Mine started with a diet and the need or I should say lack of self-esteem. It's just a form of control and thinking we'd be accepted better if we were skinny.|`|Fq3vo0kOaa	Some anorexic people have those feelings but i think everyonen is different, when i was in highschool, everyone was anorexic Or bulemic... it was "be as skinny as that girl".. it develops differently with each & every person..

I have to make myself eat 6 small meals a day so that i don't get back into that way of thinking..

ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	I have sleep apnea also.      1 - there is only one mask.  As to why they gave you one and then ordered you another....I can't say    2 - Lets say you will sleep better and better sleep usually means feeling better.  I started to notice a difference right away.  I was sleeping soundly for about 4 to 5 hours a  night.  Not long enough, but the sleep I was getting seemed to be more restful.    3 - 32 episodes in one hour is alot.  I had a total of 365 episodes during one 8 hour sleep session.  I stopped breathing several times during the night and kept coming up out of the deep sleep that is needed to feel rested.  I am considered moderately severe.  My setting on the C-Pap is 14.      4 - It does feel weird having a mask stuck on your face.  You get tangled up in the hose once in awhile.  But after about a week I found I was sleeping okay without too many problems    5 - can't think of anything else.  If they gave you a machine with a air humidifer on it, make sure that you use distilled water.  Wash your mask nightly and the hose weekly.  I was told to use baby shampoo, anything else is too harsh.      Good luck and I hope you have good results.|`|6d18126e711f352c62adc9c85e6d27ceaa	CPAP  is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure     The most likely sent you home with the mask you used for the test.  Many times they just through that one away.  Might as well give it to you to use as an extra.  The home care company can provide you  with 2 masks per year at no or little cost to you.    5 or more an hour will qualify you for a Cpap.  I have heard of 62 an hour. I would say this is moderate.     Some take longer to get used to the machine but once you do, you will not want to sleep without it.  Yes it can be that big of a difference.     Cpap therapy only works if you used the machine.  Many machines today will record you usage and can be downloaded by the home care company.

With that being said, a good multivitamin is all that you need.  One-A-Day is a good choice.  Supplements on the other hand, may be more beneficial.    1. Cayenne pepper (natural appetite suppressant)  2. Pineapple, grapefruit and papaya extracts. (affects the body's pH and enzymes)  3. Omega 3 (though this is an oil and has fat in it, it helps metabolize stored fat and help with circulating fats and cholesterol evenly throughout your body).  4.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	I used to be extremely stressed about everything.  It's really not JUST a matter of thinking differently, though that plays a part.    How you take care of your body (what you eat, etc.) can alter the chemical make-up of your body, in turn causing you to be more jittery, edgy, or more prone to anxiety.    These things helped me tremendously:  1.  Supplement w/ Fish Oil (Omega-3) - these helps provide the brain with necessary fats to work more efficiently  2.  Reduce and/or eliminate sugar, sugar products, white flour (pop tarts, white bread, most cereals, etc.), processed/packaged foods (hamburger helpers -boxed foods, frozen dinners, fast food, etc.).    3.  Reduce and/or eliminate caffeine entirely.  If I have ONE caffeinated beverage in a day, I notice a huge difference in my ability to cope with stress.  I'm just on pins and needles it seems.    4.  Get plenty of rest (at LEAST 7 hours a night, if not more).  5.  Exercise at LEAST 2 times a week (yogo is great for handling stress).  Also, stretching exercises, even for 10-15 minutes, reduced my heart rate enough that I felt more relaxed.  6.  Read old Nancy Drew books.  They're just fun, easy to read, and take you away to another, wholesome, place.  They helped me unwind quite a bit.  7.  Make sure you're getting enough good protein (3-4 times a day); chicken, tuna, fish, roast beef, turkey, eggs, etc.|`|xfZeJAQPaa	First, you are not odd and you are not alone!     Leave your work, and go make yourself a cuppa green tea. You can think about it. Sometimes, the hardest (and BEST) thing to do is step away from a situation when you start to freak. You can think about it more clearly.     I think that perhaps what causes it is that you expect a lot from yourself. And that's okay. But if you expect yourself to succeed, you need to step back and let yourself and be patient. Otherwise, you are playing TWO roles: yourself, and over-critical teacher/parent. Who needs THAT?  Good luck!

0II2e6I9aa	Dosage of 100mg is not out of line for this drug if used for ADHD or OCD.  However, if you're taking it to try and lose weight, you could be playing with fire.  Unless taken for indicated conditions, you could have severe side effects and adverse reactions to this and other drugs.  Discuss your concerns with the doctor prescribing this medication, and you can also get help from your pharmacist.  Good luck.|`|bvoZZY3uaa	I have Asperger and have ADD, I am on Reboxetine which is a NRI like Strattera, they use Reboxetine for depression and ADD in the UK as it is much cheaper than Strattera.  Some people need 100mg of Strattera for it to work well.
MGvN5xrNaa	If he truly loved you, he would not do this to you! It sounds like he's using you.    I agree, you need to get away from him!    If he gets violent like that, I would contact police and have them assist you while you move out if you think he will try to hurt you when you move out. I would also highly recommend getting a restraining order put out on him. A restraining order can tell him to move out of the home, to stay away from you and more. If he violates these terms, police can arrest him without question. Here's a link for how to get a restraining order: http://www.larcc.org/pamphlets/children_...    I would get the restraining order on your way home or on your way to work. That way, he won't know you're getting one (I definitely would not tell him you're getting one, or he could react violently).    Just in case you need this:  The Domestic Violence Hot-line is:   1-800-799-SAFE  OR 1-800-799-7233|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	There are so many red flags with this man.

One thing for sure is that when you don't feel safe or comfortable about a person, then you need to start making plans for escape.  The longer you are there, the more difficult and complicated it becomes.  You are the only one who knows all that is occuring and how you really feel about it.  So I say, follow your gut instinct and GET OUT!|`|AA10187097	You need to move out and cut all ties with this man before it's too late.  If you wait too long and even marry him,you will find yourself trapped in an abusive and dangerous situation. He has already shown himself to be violent. How long before you're the one on the receiving end?|`|xihWos2maa	Go stay with your parents for a while. This man sounds overprotective and dangerous. It will only get worse from here. I would leave him if I were you. Good luck!|`|djhCah5Maa	My ex-huband got this way.  He never actually hit me, but he would yell and break things.  He was very controlling too.  It became overwhelming for me.  I went to a therapist.  She told me that he displayed all of the signs of an abuser.  She told me that if I stayed with him, then he most likely would abuse me.  If you don't feel safe, then trust your gut feeling.  Don't wait until it is too late.  There is also emotional abuse.  I was so afraid to leave even though I was so unhappy.  You are young.  Don't waste you life with this guy.|`|Fq3vo0kOaa	You need to get away from him, once & for all..........Just pack your things when he is gone, and don't look back, don't talk to him to answer his calls don't listen to his lies, he is obsessive & he is trying to control you...

Run baby run!|`|FoNexM3iaa	you need to talk to him.  if that doesnt work you need to end it and if he gets even the least bit violent call the police asap!  dont be too scared  he is not allowed to hurt you and if he does you can put him in jail|`|AA11705584	wow you really need to leave.

Go to your parents or friends house. Sort out the financial agreements you have. If you pay rent offer next months rent and say you are no longer living there. If you bought a house tell him you want to sell.    When you leave him cut off all contact. Change your email phone number whatever if he harasses you.    His obsession could turn into domestic violence. Leave while you still can.    p.s. Have someone near you when you leave him like waiting outside so If he attacks you can get help.  BE STRONG AND GO|`|ZjMk8Icqaa	You need to be up front with him . Don't be scared of him. He knows you are and that's why he is doing what he does he has the power and it should not be like that. Tell him how you feel tell him that you Will go out with your friends And you WILL Have fun. Don't be be like can i or anything like that. Don't seem afraid of him. If that does not work. them hunny leave his ***. I mean you can only do so much to keep a person and if you have done all you can and he has not done anything. Go be single for a while i know it will hurt like a ***** but i mean some times that's what you have to do. I mean there is some one out there for every one. everyone needs there prince charming. And he dos not seem like yours. I hope everything works out.|`|68y8IWo7aa	Get away from him NOW! This is an abusive relationship and can only lead to worse things. He "says" he loves you so much, and thats the problem. You are officially his property and he controls your life. Even if he doesn't hit you, he's still abusing you mentally by hanging out with bad people. You need to get away from him immediately. But here's the thing, do not break up with him by yourself. When you break up with him, if he really loves you, he will probably break down and say that it's not worth living without you. Do not believe him at all. Get away with him. And be with a friend while you dump him. Preferably a guy friend. I'm sure your friends who are girls already know about this relationship but if you haven't, tell all your closest guy friends about this situation. They will take care of it. Just be careful. You have to meet him in person WITH people and dump him. Do NOT text dump him or myspace dump him. Just be with friends, and hopefully he'll be gone. I hope it works out.|`|0F8hauikaa	He sounds like he has control and anger issues. People like that don't change unless they recognize their problem and seek professional help.  I think you should start making a plan to leave, without his knowing of course. In the meantime, have an emergency escape plan. Have a place lined up to go, friends, relatives, a shelter or police station and always have your phone and keys within easy reach and leave at the first sign of his temper getting out of hand.|`|I83sYbARaa	Contact a womens shelter or someone who deals with domestic violence for support...  make a plan to leave, save up some money and stash it somewhere, orin a bank.,   pack a bag,   leave,   and dont look back, and   dont go back...  Save yourself, dont be in doubt about taking good care of yourself....  deal with your feelings for free at www.emofree.com and pass if forward|`|RluCMVUSaa	When he gets up and goes to work you pack your sh!t and leave... plan it ahead so that a friend has all the boxes and help that you need.  He comes home and you are just gone ; )- If you give him a heads up then you have to deal with the violence and control that he can create if you just set a date, schedule the day off and act as though it is a normal day the surprise throws him.  Save your money in cash that he can't find or open a bank account that he is unaware of.    This isn't a relationship worth saving and while it may sound cold to just walk, when you are dealing with someone that may physically try to stop you or hurt you then you need to do it in the safest way possible and unfortunately he doesn't sound like someone who can sit down and chat and work this out... you don't want to be there when he realizes that you are ending the relationship, do you?    Good luck! Please get the hell outta there!|`|4WXK187vaa	Cammie,    I can feel your pain and fear. Maybe he just needs to feel secure in this relationship; what if you invite him to join you? Have him meet your friends...and hang out with you and your crowd.     Maybe he had some past infidelity issues in a past relationship. does he go out with the boys? How does that make you feel? You need a better communication method with this man...maybe Counseling.    Good Luck, Mystified|`|fkQUCwUhaa	hon that is very upsetting...sounds like you need to get out of there as quick as you can,  your a good woman with a good caring heart, who deserves better,  i hope you can get out and find the right man you will treat you right, like a lady with respect  and  not  somebody to own...i wish you goodluck with it and hope you make the right choice...love an prayers.
YwrnBMeiaa	Well i'm 15 years old, and occasionally i'll still suffer from my dad's random blows and beatings. It's pretty rough. The best thing I can tell you, is that you need to look to the future with a positive look on life. Don't let what you suffered through ruin your life. Remember, it's not your fault that you went through child abuse, so why should your life have to be the price? I talk to a psychiatrist every four weeks or so, and it makes me feel better to know that I can let those feelings out. Good Luck!|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Counselling is the best option.|`|1YEtUVHnaa	I know where you have come from I am not an adult yet but was abused when I was 11 years old. My best suggestion would be counseling, I know that has helped me a lot since it happened. Also if you are having dreams about it write out the dream and change the ending to something better. It worked for me you can probrably do the same thing with just thoughts, write out the thought and then chang it, visualize it make it a happier ending. That is my suggestion hope it helps.

If I don't use sun block and get a sunburn then I peel and go back to being pale white.  I also live in Texas and am pure white.
F1OIpk4daa	Brown discharge normally means infection or as you've quite rightly said old blood.   Are you and your husband trying to have a baby at all? If you're mid cycle & ovulating, if you were to fertilize an egg, the blood could be a sign of it implanting itself to your uterus wall.   I myself personally have had bleeding in the past, I didn't worry too much about it. As I like yourself don't have any infections. I just assumed it was some old period blood that may have been delayed discarding itself.   If in doubt go to a dr's, just to play safe. Good Luck|`|nUpMQhkTaa	Completely normal.

Hope that helps =)    P.S. www.justmommies.com is a pregnancy site with a message board, they can answer questions that you have.|`|nR0dxezGaa	Certain birth controls can cause spotting in between cycles, you should check out the possible side effects of your b/c if you are on one. Sometimes my cycle gets out of whack too.
AA10766729	There will probably be trace amounts of hCG in your blood (and urine) for about 3-5 days, but maybe as long as a week.  It takes time for your body to stop producing the hormone and to flush it from your system.  So if you took a test today, it may still come back positive.|`|kj507W26aa	Call your doctors office and find out!

You must have been eating like  pure sugar at first for that to change that much. Or you lost a ton of weight.  WOW!!! GOOD!!! Job.|`|AA10299265	Great. The person who said it's too low is using some standard other than the ones I've read about which all say that normal is between 4 and 6% and that diabetics should shoot for that range to avoid complications. I was 5.8 last time it was checked. I thought I was doing well until it was suggested (by a doctor) that I shoot for 4.8. Congrats on your achievement.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Don't mean to rain on your parade, but that sounds a bit too low.   Too low isn't good.    An HbA1c of 5.0 suggests that your average blood sugar is 90.  This also suggests that you may be going to low.  Hypoglycemia is not a good thing.  Doctors are especially sensitive about lower level HbA1c's with patients who regularly drive, this being a prime example of a short-term motivation for preventing hypoglycemia. Many diabetics have died behind the wheel as a result of a low blood sugar, especially for the reason that frequent hypoglycemia results in a higher tolerance (ideally the patient is seized with a feeling of panic, an increased heart rate, profuse sweating, etc.) for the condition and some patients may not even consciously realize their blood sugar has dropped to dangerous levels. In addition to acquired tolerance, the use of alcohol and certain drugs (marijuana, for example) can create moderately similar symptoms to those of hypoglycemia (especially when used in combination) and for this reason the patient may not realize he/she has contracted hypoglycemia.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	i would hope it would be 5 especially since you don't even need oral meds or insulin to control your T2 diabetes.|`|YZ8XmCAraa	Normal or preffered A1C level is 7.0.

Keep up the awesome work! Those numbers are amazing! :D|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Wow, that's incredibly low!  That's a normal non-diabetic range!  I'm usually around 6.3, but as a Type 1 I'm thrilled with that.  Good job!|`|Yaxdy8U2aa	omg....im soo happy for you....my A1c's are never that good  :(  could you give me some tips on how you lowered it.....thanks bunches|`|cASB8Sh3aa	AWESOME NEWS!  Congrats on that great level!  You must have done quite a bit of work to get that number down, pat yourself on the back!    My last a1c was 5.8 and that was after a year of dropping a1c's from 11.6 to 8.9 to 7.0 to the 6 range.  I only was able to get a 5.8 from being on the pump.  This has made my control so much easier and my life better.    It is difficult dealing with a chronic disease and you are doing great!
MEOjwPCNaa	You might have some sort of nutritional deficiency. Many people overeat in part because their body is actually craving a vitamin or mineral they aren't getting enough of.|`|AA12182074	Hmm... I don't really know.  The only thing I can think is that if you crave salty things maybe your body isn't  getting enough?|`|LmicIEOxaa	The tongue has different taste buds that sense different things. When you overstimulate one region, the other tries to balance it out. That's why you have to understand your taste buds to lose weight successfully over the long haul. You should try to eat food in a moderate seasonal range, not at any extreme.|`|oFV48JbGaa	Because you're fat and gay.|`|OySU2oAkaa	It's because your body needs it.

ldpDzaolaa	you probably have an impaction in that the tooth is growing in crooked and sideways and need to have it removed. it will continue to stay like that or cause your other teeth to shift. have it removed and have other teeth eval for removal, cause it's better to have all removed at once and go through it once, rather than 4 times individually. if you're in the military, they will take them out for you and save you the trouble.     IN the meantime, rinse with warm salt water, soft tooth brush, it will stay aggravated until you remove it.
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	I am 28 weeks pregnant, and my husband and I opted not to have any pre-natal testing done. We did not want to know, nor did we care. We are both extreme pro-life advocists. Sorry if you don't share my views.     We feel that if you want to know what the chances are of your child being mentally handicapped just for the sake of knowing, then by all means proceed with your testing. But, to test or be counceled to find out because you plan to abort the baby if it's chances are higher then you want, you are playing trying to play God.     Not only do we have religious views against using this testing/counseling as a means of trying to have a "perfect child", but we feel that counseling could lead to have tests performed that are not safe, and also have too many errors in the results. For example, my nurse asked me if I wanted pre-natal testing performed. After we said no, she explained that the test could come back negative and something still be wrong, or it could come back positive and nothing be wrong. In the meantime, if positive, you go through an extensive list of pre-natal tests that are usually dangerous to the otherwise healthy pregnancy, and the agony of not knowing whether or not you'll have an abortion. I think that genetic counseling is useful when multiple pregnancies have been lost, and no there is no obvious medical reasoning, but again it only gives you a number or percentage, not a definite answer of what may acutally be going on. I'm sure there have been far too many healthy babies aborted, just because a test showed there MIGHT be a problem. That's my opinion. Hope it helps!|`|EQydFhzmaa	In some respects I would think that it would be acceptable to use genetic counseling. Useful of course, but acceptable is depending on what your beliefs are. Lets, for example say that mental illness runs within a family's genetics. If they are willing to take on the responsibilities of a child with Autism or Bipolar Disorder, then they can be more prepared in that respect. If they don't feel that they would be up to task, they may instead consider adoption and give another, already living child a loving home. I think genetic counseling like this is fine, especially if it could prevent another parent from "ditching" or giving up on their child once they find out how much of a responsibility a mental disorder really is. (If you were talking about a different kind of genetic counseling, where parents are able to decide what gender, eye color, etc. of their child, I find that to be very wrong.)|`|4zoN1U3Waa	before it`s NOT yet conceived yes.Because there are chances that you can be helped to conceive it without  genes of a particular disease.

T16Zmtc3aa	Headaches are normal with strep throat.  You are probably seeing spots because you got up too fast.  If you had been resting for awhile and than got up really fast it could cause hypotension.  You need to sit up for a few seconds before you stand up.  Also, having really swollen glands is normal too.  They get swollen because they are infected.  The antibiotics should take care of that in a few days.

As far as having an increased interest in sex, probably normal.  If you perceive your penis has grown noticeably it may heighten your awareness of sex.  Sounds like you are just a normal, horny,  healthy guy.  Enjoy it while you can, after 21 the years zip by all too quick.
yIxLi8r6aa	My husband and I own an herbal store.  You can use a bitter herb.  Meaning it has to taste bitter.  A great one to get is called wormwood.  You can order it online from any herbal dealer or store.  It tastes terrible but it really gets rid of worms and other intestinal critters.  Also, it would be good to use senna along with it if he has any problems with constipation.  Senna is also an herb.  Just boil both herbs, slightly sweeten with honey, cool and drink as often as you need to.  There are no side effects. Hope this is helpful.

Not to mention you will be doped up on pain killers.|`|0dd9ce8bc5332fb84c503aa81dea46fcaa	Probably not. It's painful and you'll be kind of zoned out by painkillers. My jaws were swollen and I couldn't open my mouth much. Three days after my surgery I had to take the ACT exam. I went with friends and they were joking around and laughing and when I laughed it hurt!  I was so doped up I don't remember anything except being driven to the site and sitting in the classroom. I got a better score than I expected - probably because I was too doped up to care and just picked the first answer that sounded right rather than talking myself out of the right answer!  Ha - funny memories from a painful time!  My advice - see how you feel after the surgery, then decide. But don't be surprised if you don't feel like going to your friend's.|`|O0VQqIkDaa	Each person is different.  My sister had hers cut out and she was in pain.

735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I think that when you have ADD you have a drive "to do" something active or just go and move.  Stimulants are what calm the mind of an ADD person. In some European countries, ADD children have coffee to quiet them.  I have been reading a book, "Change Your Brain, Change Your Life".  It's on brain function, behavior and emotions.  It gives non-drug exercises and treatments together with a more refined set of criteria to choose medicine. It may be that you don't get much out of reading, but even so, try this book if you can.  People with ADD can be very successful or not   depending on how you learn to deal with the strengths you have. Unfortunately, because teachers find ADD kids "difficult", kids can get self esteem problems. Fortunately, school is not real life and those of us who suffered through school can finally excel once we get into the real world.  Illegal drugs may be fun but getting caught or addicted can ruin your life or at least make a huge hassle, so I'd avoid it.  Anyone can get addicted to an addictive substance if they use it one time too many and that number is never told in advance.  The book I recommend has sections on drug and alcohol actions on the brain. The interesting thing about the book is that it is   based on SPECT scans which show brain activity as it is happening. THe docotor who wrote it has a true understanding of how brain function molds behavior and drives and emotion.    ++++Added later: Dr Amen who wrote the book I mentioned above, has written a book an ADD, too,  Healing ADD: The Breakthrough Program That Allows You to See and Heal the 6 Types of ADD (Paperback).  Maybe it would be a better one for you.      http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425183...  ef=s9_k2a_c2_t4?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&...|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	well I have a similar personality as you and I stared taking medication for my ADD months ago.Let me tell you that it has worked Great for me and can stay on task and wow what it does for my brain.Just keep in the back of your mind that you have a addictive personality.Best of luck.|`|NIEt2CEZaa	Well the meds for a.d.d. are stimulants to help you focus and not get distracted easily so you can follow through with a task.    The good thing is the meds that are for a.d.d. wear off at the end of the day and are not a psyche drug.    The psyche drugs are the ones to be cautious about since they alter your chemical imbalance on your brain.    I personally feel it would be safe to try and see if it improves your well being.     check out this site www.webmd.com and type in bi-polar also to see if those symptons fit you better than a.d.d.     there is a lot of info on that site.|`|bFKjV7U5aa	Because of your drug use and self-admitted "addictive personality", you are at a high risk of becoming addicted to and abusing stimulant medications, especially medications prescribed for ADD. If you do need a prescription for ADD, I recommend talking to your doctor about Vyvanse. It is similar to Adderall XR, but it has been reformulated to reduce the addiction and abuse potential.    I also want to comment on a post by "dj b". This person seems to not have much of a clue about what she's talking about. I'm not sure what she means by "psyche" drug, but ADD medications most certainly are powerful drugs that have a profound effect on your brain. They work by stimulating the dopamine and norepinephrine receptors in your brain. Its not known *why* this treats ADD, but it does. Many researchers believe that it makes *everything* more stimulating, even things that you don't want to concentrate on. But because everything is more "stimulating", you can actually pick and choose what to focus on.    If you truly need ADD medication, then the risks probably out weigh the benefits.    If you have any questions at all, feel free to contact me using my profile.|`|7jxbpo0Qaa	It is true that medications for ADD or ADHD are stimulants but when given to a person with this type of disorder they act in reverse thus calming the person.  IF u follow dosing directions, do not extra medicate or mix with alcohol and/or other drugs ur rate of success is about 90%.  Dependency and "acting out" behaviors will still be a work in progress for you,  but u will have some tools to cope.  You still have to do some work...medications are not a guaranteed cure for hard work.  Zak u can do this!  Last mont u sounded frustrated and internally angry..now u seem optimistic!  Told u life can be good.    Both my kids were on meds for ADD and ADHD.  It worked for one but not te other.|`|3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	No, you do not need to worry when starting an antidepressant. They are not addictive to anyone and may help you a lot. Straterra is not a stimulant and has no addictive potential but can help with ADD.    Ritalin is a stimulant and does have an addiction potential to people who don't have ADHD (I know you have ADD). People who have ADHD do not get addicted to Ritalin. I'm not sure about people with ADD. Ask your doctor. He knows and he will tell you the truth.    I don't have ADD but I have unresolved symptoms of Major Depression. Among those symptoms that I have are all of the symptoms of ADD. It's no fun as you know. If anything has the potential of helping and your doctor thinks it may help you, I say, Go for it. If it helps you it will improve your life a lot.    Hope something I have written has helped.
6sPcYQr0aa	Continue the aerobics. Yes you are probably gaining muscle. Don't be alarmed, muscle is not fat. But muscle weighs more than fat. That is one of the major reasons why going by weight instead of body fat percentage is the wrong way to go. Losing weight could mean you are losing water weight, fat weight, muscle weight... many things contribute to your weight. So please do the world a favor and help to abolish this claim that weight is the almighty factor when determining whether or not people are healthy. Dont ever be afraid to build muscle, it makes you healthier and therefore stronger.  Good luck and God bless.|`|niZBsn9Qaa	same thing happened to me, i had always done exercise (cardio and weight training) but the first 2 weeks i lost 11 pounds and then ive gained 4 back. I'm very frustrated too. I dont know why, It could be because im close to my period, but its been over the last 2 weeks ive gained the 4 pounds, so i just dont know. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.|`|NEA9bsbdaa	i know when i exercise alot, i teld to be more hungry---then i end up eating MORE.  the trick is to diet AND exercise. there have been studies (you may want to research them) that pitted groups of people who only exercised, ones who only dieted, and groups that both dieted and exercised. the last group lost 2-3 x's as much weight.    try eating 5-7 small meals a day, then ramp up your cardio to like 35-45 minutes, really pushing the pace. also incorperate wiehgt or resistance training 3-4 times a week. building lean muscle helps you lose weight or fat, cuz muscles need more calories to survive.   above all, be patience, it takes a few weeks to start seeing results and to drop pounds. you have to speed up you metabolism and put your body into a calorie burning mode.|`|ReHd1IlYaa	yes but if you do its just muscle, so you can look thinner even if you are gaining weight
EcCbforQaa	I disagree. Masturbation is a God given gift meant to be enjoyed. If our sex organs were not meant to be enjoyed they would not have so many nerves in them.|`|E64juLwJaa	I totally disagree:all done in modesty is not harmful.  Your family member should not talk about his patients and probably treats extreme cases.  Planets|`|RfGiuZ15aa	It's not the least bit harmful unless you try to do it to many times a day. Then you'll be rather sore. To avoid that use some baby oil on your erect penis while masturbating. It will also heighten the pleasure. But to really add to the pleasure insert a well lubricated dildo or buttplug in your butt while doing it. You'll love it.|`|uiVEaxjqaa	No masturbating is good for you just as long as it doesn't become a problem like you would rather be buy your self then have sex with your girl friend that's when it becomes bad for you.|`|ZOQ0WKxsaa	Masturbating is just 100% natural, it releases stress and reduces the chance of getting prostate cancer.    People who sell stuff and say it's bad just want to earn money.    It's only bad when you masturbate 15 times a day, and if it affects you from work.|`|AA11954179	Masturbating could be harmful if you did it both continually and repeatedly that means what you had done is overwhelming to ur body.     For some people, masturbating four times a day is their maximum. Reaching their maximum will bring them some so-called bad effects, such as too tired, sleepy, depressive to achieve dairly tasks. Some will may lose interests in having sex with women, since masturbating is so convenient , confortable, and self-satisfied and persuading a women to have sex in not easy in comparison. Additionally, masturbating cost a guy's energy as well unless you do excercise regularly, otherwise after masturbating ur maximun times, you will be lazy to do physical things, like doing sports or make love.    for some olders or patience, they may suffer  premature ejection, less seimen later on. So, I think ur question is too general. whether masturbating will be harmful or not, depends on individuals.    Less than three times a day for a guy is normal.    Moreover:  It is nothing to do with right or wrong, agree or disagree because this is a very "personal" problem and different ppl have different physical conditions. what are those "many experienced ppl"'s body condition you mention here? Are yours similar to theirs? If so, yes, I agree with you since you are just like one of them.

If twitching is severe,small injection of botulinum toxin can temporarily cure spasms.......Hope I helped you!
ZNhP3mpUaa	Prescription and nonprescription drugs are BOTH very dangerous... hate to bring it up, but read an article on the late Heath Ledger... That will answer your question. RIP Heath.|`|lCzBONU1aa	Yes.  You can die from taking to much of anything.  You can take to much water, it's called drowning.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	No one will immediately have a "high tolerance" to anything unless they build it up.     Ambien is perfectly safe to use, but only under the supervision or at least knowledge of your doctor. The only reason is because it can interfere with other meds that you may take or medical conditions you may have. If you follow the dosage correctly, I'm sure your not going to die.|`|nNv4AGh6aa	Absolutely. Medicines are prescribed in certain doses and how often depending on numerous factors, including a person's age, weight, other medical conditions. Taking any pill that was not prescribed to you by a Practitioner who knows you medically is always a very risky behavior.     You might want to do some research on "insomnia" and see if there are other methods that might help you sleep other than taking a medicine that was not prescribed for you.|`|0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	"Too many sleeping pills" indicates an overdose, where death is possible. However, the stronger sleeping pills that people used to fatally overdose on regularly have been off the market for years. Unless you have a sensitivity to the medication or a bad reaction/interaction, you normally vomit first from the amount that would have to be ingested to be fatal.    But because of these sensitivities, it's best you just see a doctor yourself, rather than take someone else's meds. Different meds treat different sorts of insomnia, and you need to rule out other problems that might be keeping you awake.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Yes, if you take more than the recommended dosage, you can die.|`|RY1xuwzoaa	Well, obviously, taking higher than the recommended dosage could be dangerous.  I can't imagine one tablet being too terribly bad.  Ambien, however, causes blackouts in some people so you want to be ready to lay down and go to sleep.  There have been endless stories of people making phone calls or even driving somewhere and waking up the next morning completely unaware of what they did...  Pretty scary...    Try taking something over the counter like Sominex.  These work pretty good and 1. are legal and 2. are safer than borrowing a friends prescription :)|`|4zoN1U3Waa	Yes you can die,and your "friend" is not a good friend. See a Doc get your own sleeping pills prescription..|`|7X0zAd9kaa	I wouldn't take the ambien unless your doctor prescribed it.  That is a very strong medication.  Instead you should try taking tylenol PM.  The over the counter medications are safe as long as you don't take more then the maximum amount listed on the box.  Please don't take your friend's ambien and instead try the over the counter then if that doesn't work visit your doctor.    I hope this helps!|`|dInKk1wDaa	All sleeping pills can form dependency.  Be very careful if you are taking them and you aren't being supervised by a doctor.  Sleeping pills b/come addictive because the first few nights you will sleep better but then you will not be able to sleep for a few nights after that.  I became addicted to sleeping pills without even realizing it, (I got mine from a doctor who kept increasing the dose).  I was addicted to Ambien.  I eventually just stopped taking all the pills one night after 3 years of taking them and have never taken a sleeping pill again.  It took me over a year for my sleep cycle to return to normal.    The best thing to do would be to try some natural cures.  Drink warm milk, eat some turkey, take a hot bath (lowering your body temperature makes you sleepy), do some deep breathing.     I use to have severe insomnia but I was able to cure it through having better sleep hygiene.  Sleep Hygiene consists of things like not reading in bed, sleeping in a dark room, going to bed when tired, not drinking caffeine.    The problem with taking pills from friends is you don't know what is in the pills, if you could have a reaction to the pills, and what the proper dosing is.  The internet should not take the place of a doctor.|`|4JXI0pK7aa	You only die if you take excesses of it. Ask your doctor for advice, and try herbal pills. Try not to do anything electronic right before going to sleep, as it makes your brain go into hyper drive. Try something relaxing like hot chocolate, a bath/shower or reading a book. Good luck =)
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Well in most cases of acute (short-term) diarrhea the body is using it's self cleaning mechanism to eliminate an irritant. This is necessary and should be left to run it's course, as annoying as it may be.     However, you can treat your symptoms by one of several ways:    1. Replace fluid lost. Drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol and caffeine.   2. Replace electrolytes- Broth or soup containing sodium, and fruit or vegetable juice containing potassium. You can also use re-hydration solutions like Pedialyte or Oralyte.  3. Eat easy to digest foods. Try to avoid milk products and foods that are greasy, highly seasoned, high-fiber, or very sweet. At first, you should avoid solid foods altogether. As the condition improves add bland, low-fiber foods into your diet (bananas, plain rice, boiled potatoes, toast, crackers, cooked carrots, and baked chicken without skin or fat).|`|srjxZrxZaa	Lots of fresh fruit.|`|etPa1fbUaa	Sip slightly salted warm water about as salty as a tear drop half a cup should do the trick.|`|FegAXbgiaa	I hope you find something here, home remedies for diarrhoea    http://www.home-remedies-for-you.com/rem...

I recommend Immodium.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	As you cannot rush to the shops to buy anything at the moment the best things to help bung you up are toast, cheese and grandma is right about eggs but I always scrambled them.

Also blackberry leaf tea is very good, it also has tannins but no caffeine at all. My daughter has lupus and used it several times when her colon was spasming out, worked very well for that.  It very well could be your diet, beer has yeast in it and when yeast is combined with sugars, even fruits, they will multiply and can cause diarrhea. Cut out the beer, eat a well-balanced diet and drink tea each day and see if that helps.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Try a cork|`|lBRud4y5aa	Cut down on the beer and eat sensible food.

PweOfKnGaa	A light meal is OK but dont eat a heavy meal before taking a sauna. It will preoccupy a lot of your blood for digestion. You want to circulate as much blood as possible.   Dont drink excess water (a glass or less is fine) before entering the sauna. It will reduce the effectiveness of the detoxification process.   Prior to sauna make sure to shower and wash off all lotions and body care products  After leaving the sauna, sit out prior to shower for about 10 minutes to let your body cool down and finish its toxin removal.   After you've taken your sauna and cooled down, its time to rinse off. Because you have already showered and taken sauna, it is not necessary or recommended to use soap or lotion. This allows your skin to complete the toxin removal and you'll find that your skin will be quite supple and lotions will not be necessary.|`|wYTDwWnEaa	1. Its best to use the sauna after a workout.

The heat will relax your muscles.  2)  I'd do the sauna 2-3 times a week, but this is personal preference.  It's not good to stay in the sauna for too long, half an hour tops.  3)  Rinse your face with water and dab dry after your work out and before the sauna to get sweat off.  The sauna will make you sweat even more.  I don't know the technical reasons why it helps, but it really does make your skin feel great!  Must be all that moisture in the air and the heat.  4) I have no idea, sorry.|`|SiniSj1eaa	wow I was just wondering the same things last night..thanks for asking!!

aIiGOudwaa	You can start drinking water right away! And it's good for you too as your body is healing.  However try not to rinse the back of your mouth with water up to 24 hours after surgery.  And I know it may be tempting to use a straw, but do NOT do so for at least 24 hours or longer if you can help it.  Using a straw puts too much pressure on your new wound.  Oh and also avoid mik and icecream for the first 12-18 hours.    If bleeding should develop soon after you leave keep steady pressure on the bleeding area by biting firmly on a gauze roll placed directly over the bleeding site for at least 30 minutes. Pressure helps reduce bleeding and permits formation of a clot in the tooth socket.  However, slight bleeding, oozing, or redness in the saliva is not uncommon.  Good luck!|`|AA10725924	Any time, as long as you can do it already.|`|90oDPtNzaa	Immediately just no smoking that will cause dry socket..

Stick to your healthy life, results will eventually start showing in about 3 to 4 months.   Concentrate on better cardio exercises like jogging and sprints along with cycling , this will have better weight loss results and better toning.  The key is patience.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Not eating does not help you loose weight. Not eating makes you gain!!!|`|bg86ji6naa	vollyball practice isnt real exercise. stop eating junk food, don't just cut back.and dont dip your fruits and vegetables into chocolate sauce before you eat them|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesnt really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|RKqrv2bpaa	how did u know that u r not losing weight , u have to wait !    you just keep on ur diet and diet is not useful at all Without EXERCISING!! remember that in ur mind     best wishes|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Try eating 4 balanced meals a day instead of just 3 or skipping meals This way you're less prone to eating snacks and also it would keep your metabolism more consistent rather than eating one big meal all at once.  Try not to skip meals too because that would make you eat more at the next one.    You should also vary your workout.  Try walking or doing some other kinds of exercise.  This way you would work other body muscles that you don't use when you play or workout in volleyball.  Remember to drink plenty of water too throughout the day.    There's also what people call a weight plateau that happens when you reach a certain weight and you just can't seem to lose any more.  Instead of concentrating on the fact that you didn't seem to lose any weight and get frustrated, concentrate on the fact that you're still eating healthy, exercising regular, and sticking to your diet plan.    You can also use a tape measure to take note of your vital statistics, even though you can't see it on a scale, your measurements will show a loss or a change.  Keep yourself motivated during this time.  Its during this weight "plateau" that people give up and start to gain their weight back.  Good luck and stick to it!|`|kONruaHjaa	Well for one your still growing and bodies still changing, but I know that doesnt help.  Doing sports will add muscle mass which weighs more than fat anyway.  Aslong as you're healthy, which it sounds like you are you'll be fine.   I was 'chubby' when I was in high school n I'm now a size 10 which suits me.  I'm sure you're not actually a bad weight for your height aswell|`|i7gqxO0Caa	I used everything to lose weight, and nothing worked until I used acai berry.  I understand they say that pills won't work, but they sure worked for me, and they have been shown on CNN too.There's a free trial on currently at http://kinaracs.niar.tv , give it a try, why not?
V27IROySaa	From what I understand it is only safe to take a Melatonin pill once every 24 hours and that one should not take them for more than two weeks.  They are really great for someone who may have to go to sleep at a time they are not used to.  Personally, they helped me a lot.  The problem is that they can help you fall asleep, but they do not keep you asleep.  I took them for about 3 weeks (more than the recommended time period) and they helped me after about a year of sleep problems.  However, they gave me terrible stomach cramps.    Your mom just needs to find something that works for her, but I do not think she has shoul
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Well I think the government should pay up for this because they make us pay Medicare and Social Security taxes out of each paycheck. Why should we pay for something that won't be available to us? In order to secure these programs, they have to stop all of this ridiculous spending, and actually use the money for what it's for.    Stop making us pay for prisoners with no chance of parole, to get a free education that they will never use.  Stop funding places like Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics.  Stop putting the funds that we pay for gas into foreign accounts, and instead utilize what we have here in the USA, and drill here!  Stop trying to clear up our national debt, by making more! Bailouts, another stimulus plan...you can't pay Peter by robbing Paul.      I could go on and on about different ways to free up money that could be used to help sustain the lifetime of these programs. Bottom line is to cut all of the frivolous spending!!!!!|`|5DAIonR2aa	The government, so much of this tax and that tax is taken out of our hard earned checks that  think it's the least that can be done!
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	You've built up your alcohol tolerance to beer and other liquors that don't affect you. Try not drinking for a little while, and see what happens.    Also, if your wanting a buzz, try drinking something with a lot of different liquors, like a Long Island. I've heard that if you mix dark liquors with light liquors, like a shot of Bourbon, and then a shot of Vodka, your destined for at least a buzz. But I've never done that.|`|kBSlNEL2aa	Your tolerence will subside if you stop drinking for a certain period of time.|`|nNv4AGh6aa	Most folks who find out, admit that they have problems with alcohol later on in life, like in their 30's to 40's; started out with a "high tolerance" to alcohol when they started drinking.     Meaning that they would need to drink much more than others who don't develop alcohol problems, to feel the effects of it. Of course, "normal drinkers", who do not develop alcohol problems, are usually not seeking to get really high, real fast either. They are able to have 1 or 2 drinks and feel a somewhat more relaxed and or happier mood; and able to stop and leave it at that.    And they are not "looking forward" to the next time  they get to drink. Their lives' do not revolve around it.    As people who develop problems with alcohol age and they continue drinking, the disease processes of alcoholism effects the liver and usually it takes very little alcohol for the person to achieve the same affect they are seeking. Because the smaller amounts of alcohol stay "trapped" in the blood stream, the liver becomes unable to break it down and excrete it from the body.    This is why many people, with advancing stages of the disease can honestly say "But Officer, I only had 2 drinks..." when they are stopped for a DUI. They may blow a VERY high reading, 3- 4 times more than the usual legally safe level of 0.08% Blood Alcohol Content.    Because their livers are shot and they cant excrete the alcohol from their body.    So, if you choose to keep drinking in large amounts and frequently, give it time, eventually you may not need that much...  But your life & health will be ruined in the process...
0YzP6iOTaa	I felt the same way when I was your age. The suicide part, I would go to someone you can trust like a parent or a counselor anyone who you trust and tell them how your feeling. It's never normal to feel like you want to kill yourself. Hun, I am so sorry your treated like that, I know the feeling of what your going thru. I had the same experiences in school. I still hold on to alot of anger and I am 37.  But you don't want to wait that long, please go to someone anyone and tell them, and please let me know how your doing. I have been in your very shoes. Words can be very hurtful.  Lots of hugs  and prayers|`|tVF9O1Olaa	You really need to speak to your parents on how you are feeling so they can help you or go to your doctors on your own and explain what you are feeling, you could even write down your thoughts especially ones about your looks.    No one deserves to hate themselves as much as you are right now, i have been in the same situation and got help but i had such low self esteem that i would actually hurt myself because i felt like i deserved it.   This can get better but you need to get support for it. Talk to your family or see your doctor who can advise you more. Some people may say it is normal to dislike yourself when growing up and i do agree with that but i do not believe it should be as much as you are feeling right now.     Please feel free to email me if you need to talk anymore, like i said i have been going through the same thing and i am 24 now as i waited 10 years to finally get help.   Good luck|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	people change with age. you are still very young.you'll keep changing!|`|awuEWKnmaa	It doesn't bother people to look at ugly people, it makes them feel better about themselves. Really, it'd be a service to society to stick around.    That said and done, you probably don't look bad, I still think I look bad because my breasts are far too large, most women hate me for it because they want them, and I wish that I could just somehow make them disappear. it's these silly insecurities that I focused on so much in high school.    I've come to the conclusion that I'm going to have fun doing what I do and that's really all that matters to me, if someone doesnt like me or the way I  look, they can just not talk to me. dunno if you're still in high school, but life is nothing like high school, it's very relieving to not have to be forced to interact with people like that constantly. I don't know if that makes you feel any better, but there's so much less pressure when you get out of school!! college is nothing like it.|`|HEQc83d9aa	don't be daft, you have become a little bit too sensitive, you have low self esteem. You have become a servant to your paranoia!  so what are we to do with you?  1. stop beating yourself up about what other people think! you are not responsible for their thoughts.  2. get yourself out and about. Join a gym, every one in the gym are ok;they are all there for the same reason. Working out makes you feel good about yourself and gives you more confidence!  3. have a girly make over! treat yourself to a new hair style or get your nails done.  4. always always remember,that someone does love you,and there are many people out there who are worse of than you. bless you sweet heart, nothing is as bad as what you think.xx|`|7z3e2vuvaa	Sweetie listen, you're not disgusting. And don't kill yourself, because no matter how much you think no one will care, there's always somebody who will.    I know how you feel too hun, I used to have low confidence when i was younger, and it's hard to deal with sometimes. Best thing to do is just slowly try to build confidence, and try not to worry about what other people think about you, and don't listen to what they say either.    Just take care of yourself, and don't do anything dangerous **hugs**|`|bIFjwP79aa	of course you're normal :]  you've just got to find the rite friends and u shudnt be all "oh im so ugly" be optimistic!

We all have things we hate about ourselves.   I was always like you... i remember being in grade school, having my best friend who was the really pretty popular girl.. and here was me.. i was a total dork.  I looked in the mirror back then and saw a total toad.  I had a big afro, crooked teeth.. and no style.  I felt like the lost little spanish girl.  Im 35 now.  And i do not feel like that .. at all.  If we were all made the same.. this world would be a really obnoxious place.   I can guarantee you that you do not look to others how you see yourself.  I look back at my pics now.. and say.. God.. i really wasn't that bad.. had I done this..or that.. I would have been totaly happy.  Second... if you feel that bad about yourself.. change it.  Our bodies and face are like an open canvas.  You can look or feel like whoever..you want to be.  I know i will get a lot of backlash for saying that.. because everyone else will tell you to love who you are.  Which.. the truth is.. you should.  No matter what we look like.. we should always remember that we can not like something about ourselves.. but we can still love ourselves at the same time.  You can do both, you can improve your mind, and body while reaping the benefits of making yourself feel better by looking different.  If it means just doing one thing different... so be it.  Go get that cool pair of earings you love. You dont have to look like a million bucks to feel like a million bucks.  Start small.. go to the hair dressers and tell them to give you a modern cut.  If you have face/skin problems,  ask your parents instead of b day or christmas present to take you to a dermatologist.  You have access to the web, so look around at fashion.  Find a style you like.. one that reflects you and go with it. And trust me when I say this...  when your 16..the world is crazy.  I remember what it was like.. and it was a nightmare.  But.. please.. think of this okay.. especially since you mentioned suicide so much.  We only have one chance in life.  No take backs.. No oops.. i didnt mean it.  When its out there.. it is.  I am a mother of a 7 year old who is my life.  She comes home everyday telling me how cruel people are to her in school.  She cries everynight that she has not friends and that she thinks she is stupid.  My heart rips when I hear that.  For two reasons, one because I remember what it felt like.. and two because this is my daughter.  So know this.  Your parents hurt just as bad as you do..if not more when we see this.  No matter how silent or unresponsive they are, it kills them.  And, if you ever did anything to yourself,, they would literally die inside.  No person, no comment is ever worth doing anything that you cant undo.  Life may seem crazy.. and painful and scary and lonely sometimes.  But I PROMISE it gets better.  you will find a friend.  And remember what I said, you can change anything, you can choose to act like somebody different tomorrow if you wanted to.. you can change your look, personality, even how you respond to people.  I wish I knew what you looked like and I could tell you that your probably looking way too deep. Or help you improve what ever it is you need help on.  Your mom ..or aunt someone who is younger could totally help you if you just asked Im sure.  Just remember... Your not alone.|`|0VC7smkyaa	I am sure that everyone has had self-esteem issues at some point in life but for some people, low self-confidence can be debilitating.  I don't have the authority to diagnose, but what you are dealing with sounds a lot like Body Dysmorphic Disorder.    Body Dysmorphic Disorder is a mental condition where you believe that you have a "defect" in your physical apperance which causes you to be really self-conscious and overly paranoid that other people are judging you.  I think the best thing to do here would be to see a psychiatrist for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.  Whatever you decide to do, I hope you can get help for yourself soon because no one should feel like crap all the time.  Best of luck to you....
6qsocyK3aa	If the blood is separate to the poop, like it's not actually mixed in with it, it's probably just hemorrhoids.     But if it's mixed in with it, that suggests you have some sort of problem higher up in your digestive tract which NEEDS to be seen to as potentially it could be very dangerous. I don't mean to scare you but if that is the case, ignore your mother and get yourself to a doctor.    Edit: hemorrhoids are like swollen blood vessells in the anus (the hole you poop out of). Sometimes they can be painful or itchy but sometimes you don't notice them. They aren't life threatening. But like I said, if the blood is actually mixed with the poop and not seperate, it could be really serious so if that is the case you need to go to your doctor as soon as possible.|`|fJodD2WSaa	if it is not hemorrhoids which could be serious-i said if it is not hemorrhoids-it is serious- that person should get medical help. might be ulcers.     or Constipation,,,,it is one of the discomforts we have when we are pregnant because our peristalsis slows down. All you need to do is drink plenty of water, exercise or walk,and eat high fiber diet.     yeah.,,,hope it helps...|`|zLGOQQs5aa	when i was little i had that. i went to the doctor and he said it was something to worry about and he told me if it happened again get  a sample and it did happen again but i lied and said it didnt so yeah. but go to the doctor! it could be really bad!
H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. They have free clinics in your areas.  Most neck pain is due to strain and spasm of the neck muscles. The common crick in the neck upon arising is one example of neck muscle strain. This type of neck pain can be adequately treated at home. Neck pains that require the attention of a doctor include those due to meningitis or a pinched nerve.    Warmth may be of benefit in relieving spasms and pain. Heat may be applied with hot showers, hot compresses or a heating pad. Heat may be used as often as practical, but don't burn the skin. Aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen will help relieve pain and inflammation. Neck pain, like back pain, is slow to improve and may take several weeks to completely resolve. If pain doesn't lessen in a week, call the doctor. And good luck.|`|QvrhmdAtaa	There are many dangerous conditions and many not so serious that this could be a sign of.Don't mess around anymore and go to a good ER.I had a brain aneurysm back in 1986 and was told not to ever ignore such warning signs again,not that this is happening to you. But wouldn't you want to know if this is serious? I was very blessed to have lived! Don't try to just "Deal" with it and get in pronto! At the least you could get some kind of adequate pain relief which allows the body to heal more effectively.|`|Dt2Xv5Duaa	Forget about medical insurance. Go to a good or highly rated hospital's ER. They will see you without insurance and bill you. At least you will know if it is serious or not. Dont play with your health.    Chris
v3TvbdrBaa	I heard the patch doesn't work anyway!  But first, why don't you see if your boyfriend wants to quit too?!  It is easier with the support of someone who is going through the same thing you are.  Secondly, I personally don't think gradually quitting works better than doing it cold turkey.  I quit on the 23rd of January COLD TURKEY!   Once you get past the morning cravings of having a cigarette, the rest of the day should be easy.  Make a promise to yourself or a promise to someone you really care about (boyfriend, parent, grandparent, etc) and every time you think about taking a puff, think about how you will be letting down that person.

If you were able to stop during pregnancy you can stop again. Just make a goal, start off small, don't smoke for a week, then make it two weeks, and three weeks, then 4 weeks and continue on until you break the Habit that is the best way to quit. I don't know any other way, there are medications that can help you but it doesn't look like you want to take any.

jlQHB9dvaa	If you are over 40, it suggested that you have a yearly colonoscopy and yearly PSA done.  PSA will check for prostate cancer and the colonoscopy for colon cancer.  Females should always have bi-yearly pap smears and do monthly self breast checks for lumps.    Other tests for cancer are not as general.  They would include scans and such of the suspect area of the body.  Good health to you.

The fact that you can't do two things at once shows that your really aren't cut out for medical school; you might want to set your sights a bit lower.    Get off your lazy butt and see if you can get help with insurance, most schools provide low cost insurance for their students.  You can also see if you can get a job on campus that pays well and doesn't take up too much time.    As for your debt, you need to pay it, period.|`|VCIZJQCJaa	you can self advocate some of this yourself.first you need to get an itemized billing for each service,(every single aspirin needs to be itemized)talk to a manager not a clerk. you also want ot see if any debt from under 18 is on any current billings.ask if they have a charity program.,to help pay a portion off, tell them you want to negotiate the bills for far less amount.hospital bill are overinflated to cover the uninsured.  call the access project in boston(not sure if they help out of state or not)the number is 617-654-9911.they can help you with ideas too. you are not the only one in this position 14 million other college students are in medical debt.the thing i worry about is that if you do nothing chances for medical school are slim.because of the competition,and school tuition,plus your medical debt on top of everything.so best to negotiate the bills then start making at least small monthly payments until you are accepted in med. school.i don't see any other choice.|`|NIEt2CEZaa	Just to let you know fell is spelled fail and the number 2 is spelled like this two. Anyways what you can do if you were covered under medicaid on the dates you went to the e.r. then they have to be billed for it.     So you call the e.r. and give them the account number on the bill or bills and give them the member number on your medical card so they can bill medicaid. Even if you're not covered now they can still be billed if you were covered at the time.     If you weren't covered at the time i would still tell the e.r. you were but didn't have your card and to bill them cause its worth a try. Other than that im not sure how you can get it paid.

I would also type in on google i can't pay my medical bills or free medical or something of that nature to see what comes up for helpful hints to pay it.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	declare bankruptcy|`|77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	All medical bills are negotiable. They'd rather recoup part of the bill than lose all the revenue to a patient filing bankruptcy.  You may be able to finagle payments as low as $50/mo.  Call the business offices of the hospital and ambulance company you owe the money to.  I've never heard of Medicaid/Medi-Cal continuing past 18 under any circumstance, including being a student.   Getting any kind of insurance now would not help with your current bills.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Hi, this can happen from time to time- there is really nothing to worry about. As you have ruled pregnancy out (which is statistically the number one cause for missed periods), it is unlikely to be anything to worry about.

Too much soy can screw up your cycle.|`|lFqUMMAGaa	I think it would be a good idea to go and talk to your GP and seek his/her advice ~|`|4GJIOW89aa	Its most likley due to your stress, your weight loss may have contributed too though, because your body has lost weight it does not want to waste blood so stops your period.    Take some time to relax, speak to someone and keep healthy and hopefully they should come back, if they still do not return speak to your GP :)|`|sQrPXHeXaa	If you are sexually active... i would take a pregnancy test.  It is very possible you could be pregnant. you can spot and be a couple weeks late and be normal but not 3 months. I am assuming you are pregnant.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Stress is the most likely cause, i often skip the odd month when i am stressed, i once missed for a whole 6months in a row, but i came ok again,so try not to worry to much or you'll be more stressed, making the situation worse through worrying! drinking to many caffeine drinks can also cause this so try to cut down! good luck.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	As Rhianna says stress is a common cause of a missed period and the problem is dealing with the stress, rather than worrying about the missed period.     It is generally accepted by the medical fraternity that multivitamins are pretty much a waste of time in the UK and contribute nothing to improving either health or well being.    Its unlikely that your problem represents any form of pathology so I would try and relax and ignore it, Missing periods only really become an issue if you WANT to get pregnant.

WRhOlw11aa	go to the web site of your state medical board.  You can look up info on any doc liscenced in that state|`|EMNwWAuvaa	Jeff, since I am not in the UK I would think that the next best answers to this are just to ask the surgeon those questions.  The other answer would be to go away from that area and ask another surgeon what his opinion would be and what he thought of the surgeon that you are interested in.  You are going to have to be quite away from the area but not too far that he could not have hear about that person.  Also ask the surgical staff at the center where the procedure would be done.  The physical therapy done before the surgery would only make the rehab easier so that is one aspect that I don't understand.  If you have had an MRI scan how much of a percentage was the ligament torn?  If it was around fifty percent or even close to that figure the surgical route is the best option.

cwzH7DVvaa	Hello there (:    Don't worry, rambling is a fact of life. ^_^ Everyone does it, and you made perfect sense anyway.    You just need to remember - you're not alone. I'm a teenager too and I was, and still do, get bullied. I also feel extremely paranoid when out anywhere and always feel like everyone is watching me, furthermore I also decline invitations from people, and my mother is constantly accusing me of having no life - which hurts the most. So, I basically know exactly how you feel.    Judging by the information you've given me, it sounds like you may have social anxiety? I'm definitely not qualified to diagnose you, it's just I have social anxiety and you sound very, very much like me. The reason I'm saying this is that you seem to have issues leaving the house, socialising, etc. Why don't you look it up online and see whether the symptoms match what you're behaving like? I know it's freaky thinking you might have some kind of disorder, but at least it's a relief that you're not insane and other people have similar, or even identical issues.    *hugs* I really wish I could do more to help. It's really hard when everything's online and there's nothing I can really do to help you. Just for the record, I would love to help or support you in any way I can. If you ever need to talk or rant, just message me through the e-mail system on my profile.    Hang on in there, dear. (: And again, just remember: you're not alone.    Take care,    Sarah  xxx|`|Y2lArpDvaa	ok love! When I was your age I was having the time of my life. I got to a weird point when I was 19 to like 23. I know it seems long but I didn't have many friends my parents were assholes and I was living with my boyfriend and his crazy mother. I still don't have a ton of friends but I do have work friends. You see high school sucks and when you get done with it you will go to college meet new friends and forget about the suck years of being 15 and 16. I don't know why you want to leave your family but f.uck them really. Stick it out the next 2 years and then go away to school. It will be easier later trust me. I get paranoid in stores too! It sucks and it still happens to me from time to time. I am 29 now and some times I still feel alone. I think we all do. Cheer up! If you need to take to me again please do. My e mail is redcheeks@yahoo.com. The red cheeks is from me getting red faced all the time. I am a feak! Screw it!!!|`|QvrhmdAtaa	You need to be in Church with other youth and talk about it.Holding this in is like poison and you will find that you are surrounded by a group of very caring young people you will find you can relate to.It doesn't sound like your family is being very sensitive towards you.Moving out on the other hand doesn't sound like it's the answer either.You are not beyond help and anyone who has promoted this idea to you is the one who needs serious help. Please try going to Church,you will be very relieved that you did.|`|ayGeAonbaa	I don't believe for one minute you're beyond being fixed, honey. I was horrendously bullied at school and believe me, it makes dealing with social situations very difficult at times. I'm 34, and am seeing a psychiatrist because I'm depressed - and being bullied has contributed  to this.    I honestly think you should concentrate for now on doing what makes you comfortable. No-one says you have to go out but do something you do like. If going to the cinema is what is good, then fine. It's something. It's a myth that everyone goes out on the town all the time, staying in is just as fun.     I'm sorry that your family were speaking about you, but they might actually be worried, and when people are worried they often voice it in a way that may seem harsh or blunt. Try explaining that you don't feel so good and that's why you don't go out.    Lastly, I think you should see if you could get another counsellor. It might well be that the last one you had wasn't right for you. Go to your doctor or ask someone at school. Good luck...you are so worth the effort and you remind me a lot of me at 16!    PS My going out is usually limited to metal gigs but hey, it works for me.|`|f7GGTNjVaa	hi:) i feel exactly the same as you with the paranoia. i have no confidence what so ever and  i have no-one to talk to and would love to move out. trouble is, i have a chronic illness and my parents will not allow me to move out (even though i'm 18 in 3 months!) but seriously, you'd have to think this through. getting your own place is really expensive! and what my parents are trying to tell me is to sort out my problems first! but i refuse to get help. so im trapped till i do but im just too stubborn! lol. but all im saying is, maybe if you get yourself sorted then you could move. but don't just run away from your problems. im such a hypocrite lol. :)|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I think it's very rare that people are "beyond help".  Your age especially means that you've got lots of time to work through things and put them behind you.    I had to move out at a young age because I had an abusive parent.  Im now 23 and I wish I'd sought help for my mental health problems sooner.  If I had then they may have been fully under control by now.  Having said that though, I'm gaining more and more positives in my life.    Make an appointment with your doctor and ask you to be referred to a therapist to work on your confidence.    Why not join an after school group or club like self defence or something, it could help to really increase your confidence and also make new friends.    Good luck hun!|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	Girlfriend you need to dump the smokes, and forget about moving out. At your age you need to stay busy doing fun things like: sports, swimming, board games with friends, long walks, and the next time a boy asks you out say yes. Go out for supper and a movie with him,you might have a good time, just don't have sex or you'll get a disease or pregnant or both.  Get out of the house and get a part time job just to keep you busy, you need this. Even if it is at a restaurant. Good luck, just keep busy.
f7GGTNjVaa	i feel like this myself quite allot. especially when i was younger. seems a little easier now im getting older though. here are some tips for overcoming shyness...  1. Some of the components of shyness are lack of  self-confidence and anxiety around others, difficulty  carrying on a conversation, and a lack of knowledge about  the expected behavior in social situations.    Shy people can be very intimidated by people in general.  Learning how to overcome shyness may seem like an  insurmountable task, but help is available to you through  several sources.    2. You must first determine why you are shy. There are  always underlying reasons for the way a person reacts in  certain situations.    Next, try behaving in a confident manner in private and  practice until you begin to see results in public. Walk  confidently and speak firmly and soon you'll find yourself  behaving the same confident way in social settings.    As ridiculous as it may seem, forcing yourself to act as  if you are not shy can be very helpful in learning how to  overcome shyness altogether.    3. One way to boost your self-confidence is to always look  your best. Looking great makes you feel great and does  wonders for your self-esteem.    Reduce your fear of rejection by always imagining the worst  outcome possible in every social situation. Then if the  outcome is less traumatic than you imagine, you won't dwell  on the rejection near as much. Observing strangers and  acquaintances and how they relate to others can be a great  tool in learning how to overcome shyness.    4. If you are having difficulty overcoming shyness, join  clubs or go to events that interest you. It's a lot more  comfortable to engage in conversations with those who have  common interests.    The initial conversation will be much easier since you'll  already have a topic of conversation that interests you both.    5. If you do not have the confidence to approach someone  new, then smile and try to be approachable. Most people are  receptive to a smile and a friendly face.  hope that helps :)|`|QvrhmdAtaa	Then stop thinking on terms of "Acting" and just be natural.Don't worry what you think is expected of you and just let the real you come through.Try to be comfortable with you first. If you are happy with you,it doesn't matter what they think.Sounds like you need some self esteem boosting.|`|Vqe6cvRGaa	I have the same problem, guess we'll just have to deal with it, and be shunned from society eventually...|`|OAWCNff5aa	have you ever asked YOURSELF why?|`|1jwPpv3Daa	HMMM, YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND TALK MORE OPENLY AND PRACTICE WILL MAKE YOU OVERCOME..|`|4zoN1U3Waa	Learn to ask questions,for example; if someone starts to talk about cars,ask what cars they like,american,Japanese or German after that ask why,after that ask what cars they have driven or test driven.By the time its your turn to speak you will have heard a lot, thought a lot, and calmed down a lot.  My point is, be a listener other than a narrator.This way,chances of nervousness and self humiliation are super slim|`|2915fa8ce183e4d1cf1e86d2e3b0b6b2aa	Practice.  I understand where you're coming from.  I've been there.  A lot of what you say has more to do with HOW you say it than WHAT you say.  Sometimes a friendly smile helps.  You are you.   You are entitled to have your unique view and share it (as long as you're not hurting anyone, there's no reason to worry).      If you feel shy, don't beat yourself up about it.  Just continue to practice talking to people and be completely accepting of yourself.  Congratulate yourself for finding the courage to keep trying.    Good luck and enjoy...
bFKjV7U5aa	Of course you can, how else would long term memory get there? :)    The primary part of your brain that is responsible for this is called the hippocampus. There are other ways short term memory can be turned into long term memory though, especially if its a highly emotional or frightening event.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.    The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.    Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles.     When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.    You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...|`|MEOjwPCNaa	No. It takes time and a lot of hard work.

When this happens it starts to bleed for a little bit not as long as a period.    This time may have been a little rougher or they may have gotten farther into the canal than before which cause that think layer of skin (chery) to be ruptured|`|zLGOQQs5aa	yeah i dont think that was a period. she might never had her cherry poped before or something. maybe all the guys she was with were "small"|`|y8HyP1bzaa	It was not her period.

Sometimes you can bleed after you have sex and I wouldn't worry about it.|`|fJodD2WSaa	Nothing can bring you back to reality faster than vaginal bleeding after sex. Post-coital bleeding can occur for a number of reasons, and is nothing to take lightly.    These are facts that may cos the bleedings    *Cervical dysplasia:Cervical dysplasia is precancerous changes of the epithelial cells that line the cervix. Risk increases with multiple sexual partners, sex before age 18, childbirth before age 16, or a past history of STDs. Treatment is usually cryosurgery or conisation.  *Chlamydia:A bacterial infection that is usually transmitted through sexual activity or contact with semen, vaginal fluid, or blood.  *Gonorrhea:A usually sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacteria. Several pharmaceutical treatments are available.  *Vaginitis or Cervicitis: Inflammation or swelling and infection of the vagina or cervix. Treatment depends on the cause.  *Cervical polyps: Cervical polyps are smooth, red or purple, finger-like growths that grow out of the mucus layer of the cervix or the cervical canal. Cervical polyps are extremely fragile, extending out of the cervix, and easily and painlessly removed.  *Trichomoniasis: A usually sexually transmitted disease caused by protozoan. Can also be passed to newborns during vaginal birth by infected mothers. Although rare, transmission is also possible in tap water, hot tubs, urine, on toilet seats, and in swimming pools. May cause vaginitis.  *Endometritis or adenomyosis: Endometritis is defined by Dorland's Medical Dictionary, 27th Edition as an inflammation of the endometrium (the innermost layer of the uterus). Both conditions are associated with endometriosis. Adenomysis is when endometrial tissue attaches itself to the uterus, or another organ such as the ovaries, and grows outside of the uterus.  * Uterine polyps: Uterine polyps occur when the endometrium overgrows causing these protrusions into the uterus. It is extremely rare for these growths to grow in a way that is either benign or malignant. Women with uterine polyps frequently experience bleeding between periods (metrorrhagia), other symptoms includes vaginal bleeding after sex, spotting, menorrhagia, bleeding after menopause, and breakthrough bleeding during hormone therapy. Hysteroscopic-guided curettage is the preferred treatment, since the normal D&C is basically an unguided procedure that may miss many of the uterine polyps.  *Fibroid tumors: Uterine fibroid tumors are usually benign tumors. They are solid masses made of fibrous tissue. Fibroid tumors are rarely malignant. Symptoms of fibroid tumors vary among women, with some women never experiencing any symptoms at all. Women who can wait until menopause will see their fibroids shrink and disappear once their bodies stop producing estrogen. It's important that women with fibroids make sure they never take estrogen, in any form including birth control pills, since estrogen increases fibroid growth. Several treatments are currently available for uterine fibroid tumors from myomectomy and uterine artery embolization to the traditional hysterectomy.    Diagnosing vaginal bleeding after sex is usually a matter of exclusion. Anytime you experience post-coital bleeding or vaginal bleeding after sex see your physician      Hope it helps|`|XDP32iklaa	Did you stop to think maybe it wasn't her period? Maybe she tore something in the process and was bleeding. But if she's really worried have it checked out. Doctors are good.

pvYy6iTSaa	J ?  There are over 50 causes of "little red dots."  The red dots could be tiny pinpoint spots due to tiny red blood cells collection in the skin (called "petechiae").  They could be due to allergy or medicines or even unconscious rubbing when you are so tired.  If no new ones come they will likely disappear in a week.  Try your best to get some more sleep and avoid rubbing around your eyes.  If the little red dots start to appear elsewhere on your body, away from your head, then check with your doctor.

el8yX5q3aa	You can get help for both...find a good shrink.  Usually if you get a therapist they will put you in touch with the in house shrink and once a month you talk to her/him and they will give your prescriptions and keep track of progress or where something else might be needed.  INCLUDING family therapy and getting the family in there to talk too.    Don't give up....God Bless you....

That is nearly 3 inches per year.   Which is relatively normal.  You may grow another inch or two.  From your chart it appears that you are an "early bloomer".  You started puberty earlier than most guys do.  This means you probably will stop growing earlier than most.  My growth spurt was from 12 yrs to 15 years during which I went from 5 feet  to 6 feet tall.  I grew only an inch after that.

hF6uZqWRaa	Honestly 16 is a young age...your not fully develop. I'm 19 and got mine done 4 months ago. I waited till I was 18 and started saving up money and made sure this was what i really wanted. I was an A cup and got a full B.! You have a B! I would of been happy with that... Also you said you want a D, it all depends on your body frame... my body wasn't going to be able to handle over a C since im small. Im 5'2 and weight 105 pounds. I got mine done in Houston TX, $5600 was the price! Trust me its worth it, well for me it was... i did this for my self to feel better "womanly" trust me i felt like i was 12..i look really young and plus i had small breast.... but any way like i said i did it for my self and nobody else... make sure you do alot of research...and yes its painful.... i  was in bed for 3 days and after that i still needed help getting up the bed, laying down in bed, taking showers, bruising my hair, cooking, etc... 4 months later i still cant pick up heavy things...and my breast still hurt a little... but if you decided to get them done...good luck to you!|`|ff3a35c7c444e8838dc2bec0ee02e39aaa	I have breast implants, but I waited until I was 26 to get them.

I live in England and you have to be 18. The prices also vary depending on were you live. You are only 16 though and should consider this very carefully. your breasts are not fully developed yet and will probably not be until the age of between 18-21. you should let your body develop and grow into a woman naturally without interfering. but that is just my opinion, if it really bothering you go and get an appointment for yourself at a place were you can find out more about plastic surgery. I really suggest you consider this very very carefully and speak to you parents, family and friends/boyfriend (if you have one)|`|tFoSy2YRaa	At least a 34D? You don't, believe me. It is so inconvenient to have DD+ breasts.  A B cup is absolutely fine. You can wear whatever you want and buy lingerie from whatever store you want - enjoy it!|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Give it until you are 21 and if you still want to .. save up and do it    SteveC|`|6qsocyK3aa	Ok, firstly you've not stopped growing. You could grow at least another cup size. A C-cup is perfectly respectable.    Usually you have to eighteen unless there's a medical reason why you have to have it done - like they're so big they're giving you severe backache. Breast ENLARGEMENTS are not usually done before the age of 18 whatever the circumstances because there's a still a good chance you could grow.    They cost A LOT. Can tell you how much but it's in the thousands and you usually have to have them replaced every do often so it's not like a one-off payment.    Also, you say you want to be at least a D cup. How do you know it will suit you? If you're skinny having D cups might make you look like barbie... not a good look at all.|`|FIvA9OVxaa	no just stay the way you r they are very good the size they are|`|yNXlDuAOaa	You have to 16 or 18 and it cost roughly about 2000 or above.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	You have to be 18  In a hospital  thousands   Dont be so shallow, and you dont stop growing unt you are 18.|`|YNXz2tqJaa	you have to be 18    the nhs would be the safest option    a lot of money im thinking around 20,000 plus    kl    hope thisn helps :)|`|N8kxg8wgaa	and plus your 16! give them a chance! they dont grow super fast you know.   and if your 16 your not gonna be able to afford it  unless you go to china that is  Also, if you get one implant, then won't you be uneven?|`|M7k7urR3aa	Before you do you should be sure you are fully grown   and you should be 18 in the uk go to somewhere proffesional not just because it cheap this could cause problems one women went to a cheap one in manchester and ended up having 7 boob jobs because of the pain she kept having

No you don't have to use tampons at all, you have a few different options.

Jade & Pearl sponges http://www.jadeandpearl.com      Pads can be worn for swimming, but some will go soggy in water and come unstuck, you'd have to use cloth pads but only with light flow as when wet pads can't absorb as much flow. Period belts are longer than pads fastening around your waste so better protection and easier to hide, better still would be period panties, underwear with pads built-in so sit closer to your body giving you more protection. With pads wear shorts over the top to hide them. Lunapads cloth pads and padded panties http://www.lunapads.com Reddy's period belts http://www.reddyspads.com     Menstrual cups are the best option in general and certainly best for swimming, these are bell-shaped cups that collect menstrual flow, they are healthy, hygenic and more reliable than tampons or pads. You can leave them in for 12 hours without leaking so are better for swimming as you don't have to worry about embarrassment, they don't absorb pool water, and there is nothing outside your body so they are more discreet.

DhUMjZxtaa	3 years isn't so bad.    I got mine about 4 months ago and my ortho said I need them for 2 years.    I'm scared that I'm gonna need to keep them on longer for some reason even though my teeth aren't that bad.    I'm only scared because I am 22 years old and am graduating from University soon, and I don't wanna have to look for a job with braces on because I already looked younger than 22 without them and now that I have braces I look like I'm 16 years old!!!    So it's kinda sucks in my situation, but if you're younger then who cares, you get SOOOO used to braces after a few months that you don't even care after that.|`|DN3lPdE0aa	nope they said i needed for 3 years. but i had them since sep 07 im getting the off next week (: // so i had them for bout 1 year and 2 month!|`|X40Ww89qaa	yes|`|i7OFOo7faa	i have mine for 18 months    p.s.: The pain is gonna kick ur ***|`|RQVqVxcNaa	yeah itll proley take that long ive had mine on sience mar. 10 of last year and i dont even think there close to coming off|`|MRLZLAkdaa	If they said 3 yrs it is most likely gonna be around that time but i know a lot of people that got theirs off early. I have braces and i have to have them for two years and really its not that bad. I was SO worried when I got mine but now I barely notice that they are even there! Also it depends on your teeth and how fast they move. They could move very fast and u might get them off early.|`|F9amJRzbaa	alright, listen here sweetie.  i was upset cos i had to have my braaces on for 2 years. theres only a  little less then a year left, and even i admit i look so much with braces now, with my straighgt teethe underneeth , then i did before without my braces and crooked teeth. so all honesty, if anythign youll look better and better. then imagine how gorgeous youll be when they come off!!|`|VKsif0cAaa	If your cooperate with the treatment plan well (wearing elastics, proper cleaning/eating habits, etc..), you could significantly reduce your treatment time.  The 3 years is a rough estimate as all patient's teeth react differently.
yhX02yuNaa	No, you shouldn't feel painfully hungry if you're eating a balanced diet.  Eat celery or raw carrot sticks to give your stomach some low-calorie foods to digest.  In time, you'll adjust to the lower food intake.|`|q18xpBpPaa	yea your not giving your body what it needs. i havent eaten any thing in almost 3 days and im starting to get hungry. but then again im getting over food poisoning lol. dont really want to look at food...but fill up with water. it will subside the cravings|`|F89MNQheaa	Yes. The more we eat the more our stomachs (inside not just out :P) expand. Normally it is very small, about the size of our fist, so if you think if you are a couple of stone over weight your stomoach is used to being filled with more food so has stretched. If you suddenly cut down on your food intake then you will feel more hungry as its clock is telling you you should be giving it more. De carefull with diets and dont cut down drastically, go slowly as it can damage your health by making too drastic a change. Also dont just cut out certain foods as you still need a balance of nutrients, if you cut too many out that can also help give you pains.|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	no you should not be feeling hungry, perhaps you are not eating enough, you can still eat what you like just by making it healtier. if the hunger pains get really bad for no reason curl into a ball i know it sounds weird but it works, also if yu're concerned speak to your GP for avice. hope i helped :)|`|ojEkgJoqaa	at the beginning you should. your body is used to consuming a certain amount of calories and food. so when you start you will  but your body will get used to it.    but don't starve yourself do it reasonably eat the amount of calories and get the right amount of carbs, fat, protein. and other vitamins and nutrients you need.    but it wil subside after just about a week or less. depending on how much you cut down.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	Nope, eat when you are hungry, the longer you leave it the worse the food you are gonna binge on is gonna be, eat before you get really hungry so you can eat sensibly.|`|q2SzkuaXaa	If you don't feel hungry, it's probably not doing much good.    Having said that, one of the advantages of the Atkins diet is that you don't feel hungry, having filled your stomach with plenty of protein and not much carbohydrate. Hence people stick to the diet, and consequently they lose weight. But it's not exactly a nutritionally balanced diet.|`|VB76LCmSaa	if your trying to loose weight then yes, most likely you will feel hungry, not too too hungry though or you will most likely give up, just a nagging discomfort in your stomach.  this will only last until your stomach shrinks and then you will naturally crave less food, this can happen from a month to three months or so on depending on you and your diet.|`|9hTPsTvFaa	i think the trick to dieting and losing weight is not to let yourself get too hungry. because then you binge or just dont sdtick to it. personally i find eating 1200 cal diet of healthy foods, im not hungry, if i am i snack on apples, bannanas, raw carrots or have one of my meals earlier. also in the evening i sip herbal and fruit teas and throughout the day drink plenty of water. if your eating lots of fruit and veggies and wholegrains you wont shouldnt get too hungry
SiniSj1eaa	thinking about the clothes I want to wear in the summer time..|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	I presently lack the motivation.  I used to go jogging and go to the gym, but I started smoking cigarettes back in 1999 and got slack.  I quit smoking in October of last year, and I've been wanting to start working out again.  You would think we could motivate ourselves better since you feel so wonderful after a workout!  Tell you what, though.  Me and the wife seen a show on cable about folks that weighed 700-1,000 lbs. and were confined to the bed; and when they got help, carpenters actually had to cut the walls down to get them out of the room since the doorways weren't wide enough!  Now, that show motivated me to get down in the floor and do crunches and push ups the next day, but the motivation vanished again after that.  It's a mind thing.  You just have to make up your mind that you're gonna do it come hellll or high water.|`|ejrVotg8aa	I usually set goals. Like right now I just started a workout routine and I want to lose atleast 20 pounds before May. So usually I'll weigh myself every Monday morning to keep tabs on my progress. That can be motivating if I have a good week. I also found a good way is to get a partner to workout with. Then you have to go if you made plans with them. I wasn't able to schedule a workout with people so having a contest with friends helps. One time me and some friends all wanted to drop a few so we had a contest where we had some time to lose 20 pounds. Every one reported their weight every week and we kept track of it. For every pound you were short you owed the other friends money. That keeps you motivated. We all did it.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	i always treat myself after, with a shopping trip or a nap and a nice big meal out each week that way i have an incentive to go. i know how you feel though, during the winter i prefer to go home and get into my pjs than go to the gym. Try using some upbeat dance music to keep your mind occupied and motivated when you are at the gym and get dressed before you go to the gym so you are ready to go! good luck xxx|`|niZBsn9Qaa	the same thing happened to me. I didnt go at all for like 2 months. But one day I woke up and thought to myself "Each day that I don't go to the gym is just another day wasted. I'm paying for this too, so that's money wasted. I don't want to have to START OVER tomorrow so lets get the first day over with". I love the gym. What is hard for me is getting from the house to the gym. Trust me, its harder to get myself out the front door than it is to work out. Once i'm there, its on baby.     Sometimes we have to play parents to ourselves and MAKE ourselves do things that we know are good for us even if the child in us doesnt want it, like eating our veggies, going to bed at a decent hour, and yes....working out. If you want, email me and i'll be your workout partner. We can communicate daily or weekly or however you want on what we did, what we ate, and our progress. I think it would be fun to have someone doing the same as me to talk to.    Good luck :)|`|kW5HfnRnaa	you just have to commit yourself to it.  maybe doing a colon cleanse and taking vitamins will help you feel more energy.  i totally know how it can be very hard when you dont feel like yourself.  start slow.  like 2 times a week then 3, then every other day and that should be enough.  good luck|`|4GJIOW89aa	I think about the summer and what im going to look like in my costume.

You probably wouldn't notice if I hadn't told you. it's normal and goes away with the heat pad. Then you have the great freedom of no pregnancies and yes there are women that do get pregnant even with tubals, but it's really rare! Have fun.

EMNwWAuvaa	M S, the knee joint is a very simple and complex one all at the same time.  The strengths of the joint are in the redundancies it has.  For example the ACL is not the first line of stability in the knee but the hamstrings and the gastrocs are.  When they fail or the stress is too much for them the ligament goes.  This system of redundancy is found on all sides of the knee.  The joint becomes more stable the stronger the muscles are.  The weakness of the joint come from the fact that is is essentally a stick with rubberbands stabilizing it.  There is a law in physics that states where there is strength or stability there is no flexibility and where there is flexibility there is no strength.  The knee is that in essence.  The joint itself is built around two ball bearings that are not of equal size and they are supported in two cups of shallow depth and also of unequal size and stabilization.  There is a hinge joint at the knee but it is not that simple for at the same time there is a rotational movement that locks the knee when it is in full extension.  The joint is most stable when it is in full extension and most unstable with flexion.  The knee is most vulnerable to injury when it is in full or almost full extension for there is no give and the muscles cannot really stabilize it therefore exposing the ligaments to excessive force.|`|X40Ww89qaa	the solar plexus

pIvN6TY7aa	"Dermatitis" means, only and simply, an irritation of the skin.  There are about a zillion ways a person can end up with it.      What do you mean by contagious? Scabies is caused by a burrowing mite that can be transmitted from person to person. The irritating substance that causes poison ivy rash can be transmitted by touch. Some dermatites are caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.    Many everyday substances can cause dermatitis, including some soaps and detergents.    And yes, there are many kinds of dermatitis that are psychogenic (mind-derived.)|`|kC8JHWVQaa	No not really|`|ZNbauLJzaa	I can't think of anything other than poison ivy.  Your rash may be just dry skin from being in a heated house during winter.  Or maybe you were doomed to have some form of skin disease since it runs in your family.|`|AA10450066	Not usually unless it's not just a dermatitis.Some dematitis's can be caused by a fungus and are sometimes contagious,but your relatives would already know this and I'm sure wouldn't want to spread it around.

EDXh0tk9aa	This should help you decide:    Once you start puberty a white and/or clear discharge is normal. The vagina is self-cleaning. This same discharge increases the closer you get to ovulation and when you are sexually aroused. Trust me, you don't ever want it to go away. You will also have your own scent - musky - and it will smell stronger to you than to others.     You can have this normal discharge for weeks, months or even years before getting your first period and it will also continue after you get your period. You can wear a pantyliner if it bothers you.     Different Types of Discharge:    White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.    Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.    Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.    Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.    Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina. Old blood looks brown. This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Your first period can look like this also.    Different types of infections:    Signs of yeast infections:  White, cottage cheese-like discharge   Swelling and pain around the vulva   Intense itching     Signs of bacterial vaginosis:  A white, gray or yellowish vaginal discharge   A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap   Itching or burning   Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva|`|3y8YIs3raa	its fine|`|Q7kNtNSRaa	Thats's very normal|`|AA12266913	its very normal dont worry|`|ldpDzaolaa	normal variations are white, to clear near ovulation (thinner), then red/brown discharge with cycle. intercourse, sperm initially white then clear upon exposure to air ( egg white consistency/dries similarily) any green, grey/pink discharge other than above or with odor/itching needs evaluation and treatment. yes, you will have it through you whole reproductive life and more so when you get older. it means you are alive and your hormones are functioning. might see a change when/if using bcp, but not much.|`|912f0a70bd004b30afad1f94c982e49eaa	Your's is normal.

These pills haven't been evaluated by the FDA or even an independent lab.  The risks to your health and hefty price tag for the limited benefit you get just isn't worth it.

el8yX5q3aa	I would imagine sitting down.  YOu will take your time and chew more slowly ...when standing to kind of eat faster.....At least I do.    It is BAD for you to lay down and eat....food doesn't digest as well and it causes heartburn etc.   when I had cancer etc..the doctor warned me about that....|`|lN9jcKYhaa	the food will digest better and you won't scarf it down when you are sitting. also you will become more full faster when you are sitting|`|OySU2oAkaa	Sitting down definitely (mind you NOT laying down just old fashioned sitting lol).

It makes eating a deliberate act, which means that you will tend to consider what you're eating more carefully and make better choices. How often have you found yourself mindlessly scarfing down unhealthy snacks while watching TV, driving, or sitting at the computer? Eliminating these habits can do wonders for you.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Your body is giong to digest the food the same way standing up or sitting down.|`|peckUVpzaa	yea its better if u lay on ur stomach|`|8gI2WPpbaa	sitting.. as i feel full sooner|`|5sIPEujsaa	standin|`|ldpDzaolaa	It's thought that people eat more when standing up and eat faster rather than taking time to sit down enjoy meal and socialization.|`|JbDfdJb8aa	Perhaps since we have tendency to move while standing it could cause nausea and stomach upset.|`|Y6UHIhB2aa	Sitting.

Which has to do with portion control, not overeating so you get the chance to feel full. It also has to do with enjoying and really tasting your meal. Lol, having said that, I often eat standing up!|`|LjbuONY0aa	the best way to eat food is to sit and eat ...|`|Mumfvpuzaa	no difference.|`|FNeCDm3raa	Digestion wise, there is no difference.    Overall though, standing burns more calories than sitting, but not significant enough to stand all day.|`|9pB5g6rMaa	Because islam says not to eat and stand and also you get filler When you stand at the sink or fridge you forget how much you shovel in.    A story I read in the San Francisco Chronicle about how several chefs tackled their weight problems had a common thread that hit home. For three of them, simply sitting down to eat, as opposed to standing up and picking at food all day, was the key.    Most admitted they had no idea how much food they were eating during work on the line - it was "unconscious" eating.    How many of us can take a hint from that?    I've talked to enough working women and stay at home moms to know they share my secret weakness: They're vertical diners They eat standing up, generally over the sink. Or worse, directly from the refrigerator.    It's especially bad for me at breakfast, when  I peel an orange or flip up a piece of toast and gulp my coffee while fretting over everything I have to do that day. I have a perfectly lovely back porch where I could breakfast and watch the birds at the feeder and sailboats nearby, but no: I choose the view of the dirty dishes and the spitting coffeepot.   How dumb is that?    Football fans are well-known for their sofa dining.   Sticking your band in a potato chip bag is almost as crucial to game day as yelling at the ref on TV.   But next thing you know, the bag is empty, and you re thirsty from all that salt and gulping down too many suds or sodas.   A mean cycle.    Book lovers who read in bed tend to snack there, where a good book can blind you to just how many pieces of candy or handfuls of nuts you've eaten.    Sitting at a table with a plate in front of you, you are aware of your food and how much you're eating With your mind on the meal, you focus on what's going into your mouth. Your digestion is better, and you get more pleasure out of your food, even if it's smaller portions. When you eat more slowly, your brain has time to catch up to your stomach - the sated feeling will bit sooner, and you can leave the table feeling satisfied but not stuffed.    It would be grand if you could do this for three meals a day and snacks. Most of us can't Busy lives take us away from the dining room especially at lunch or on the run at breakfast.    But you can try to avoid the problem places that cause you to overeat. Make an effort to get up 15 minutes earlier to eat breakfast sitting down.    Get away from your desk at work.   Take your lunch outside or to a dedicated lounge to sit and eat without phone or work interruptions. You won't chomp your food to get back to work in a hurry It might increase your work productivity to get away from it for a while.    At dinner put away the TV trays or move the coffee table from in front of the couch: Make it hard to sit and watch TV and eat. Invite a friend over if you don't like to dine alone-, maybe swing a deal with them to cook a couple of nights a week then you reciprocate.    For all of us, sitting down and becoming civilized diners again is the answer. So for this year, let's designate the dining room as the only room in the house where fork will meet the mouth.|`|TSmZOAVvaa	Generally you tend to overeat if you are in a hurry.    So eating standing up or on the go would make you eat more.    But for your body it does not digest any different.     Also having a meal sitting down would also be a stress buster.

ximWtKVuaa	Been there ...   Vitamin E oil (NOT JELLY - it doesn't allow the skin to breathe) and Palmer's Cocoa butter stretch mark cream works WONDERS when you use them together.|`|B7WIZdglaa	i dont know the name of it but there is something for stretch marks in drugstores. i'd google it. they also say cocoa butter- but thats uusally to avoid stretch marks- not get rid of them once you have them.  massage the area where the stretch marks are.. massage it daily. tanning seems to help as well.|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	Bio Oil will work.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	UNfortunately there is very little you can do. I was in your boat as well, only I went from 185 to 115, so my stomach was horribly stretched out. I had a tummy tuck, which removed loose skin as well as the stretch marks on my tummy. Surgically that's the only way, and even then it's only if they are removing skin, according to my dr.
wFN8bVqsaa	Palmer's Cocoa Butter Massage Lotion for Stretch Marks was recommended by my doctor for stretch marks. I used it every day and I think it really helped!

5ZmwpI5Qaa	Don't be scared. I'm no doctor but I don't think you can see arteries in a Xray!    Either way, a chiropractor cannot fix your condition or any other. At best, they would just make your muscles feel better. It would be best to first see your doctor or an orthopedic specialist. I would advise that your do everything you can to avoid chiropractic treatment, as it will often do more harm than good.    Chiropractors have to believe that everything causes conditions that only they can fix so they can convince patients that we can't live comfortably without visits twice per week.    I had a stroke last year as a result of chiropractic treatment and have since made it a priority to raise awareness of the dangers of chiropractic care. I ask that anyone going to visit a chiropractor to be aware of the risks and make an informed decision about treatment.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	This is a common finding on x-rays, and normally nothing to worry about it except the Chiro should probably take it a bit easy on the neck adjustments and not overrotate (which I never do anyway).  You are young to have them. Does high cholesterol run in your family?  Or heart problems?  Get a cholesterol test - I think you can buy them at the drugstore these days!  Then if you have it start modifying your diet and exercise more - forget high cholesterol drugs they are a scam and cause more death than they prevent.|`|sFPV2KbBaa	go seek the advice of a doctor of medicine.  get some blood tests done.|`|AA11415608	Calcifications seen on an xray can be an early sign of atherosclerosis (plaque formation)of the arteries.  In a 25 year old, I  would worry about a familial type of high cholesterol that causes premature vascular plaque formation.  Anyone in your family have heart attacks at an early age?  Go see your medical doctor and have a proper work-up---this is not a death sentence, there are a lot of treatments available.|`|683fba774a10fec8e7e8b8ea4c6b7561aa	Calcification around the arteries of the neck at the age of 25 is quite uncommon. You may please repeat the xray test and consult the specialist for necessary advice. There appears no need for anxiety please.
3V1U3wxeaa	You should see your physician if the pain does not diminish within four to seven days.  The probablility of having fractured the coccyx is low, unless you lost conciousness at the time you fell.  As they cannot cast the coccyx anyway, you are safe to ride out the pain for a week.  If it is still very painful after a week, see your physician for XRays, as it is possible to chip this bone.  If you hurt it badly enough, even if not physically chipped or broken, you will likely always have problems with it.|`|CMsceWkUaa	I did that exact same thing last year  It still hurts!|`|5uHxFJpAaa	I used to play netball loads, and I broke my coxyx just by playing it, if you have broken it they never heal, I did this over 3 years ago and mine still kills, it sounds awful but I've been to Doctors and that's all they said.  Don't do too much movement but make sure you walk about a bit each day. and you can get some ointment that will ease the pain, hopefully you haven't broken it|`|c7UC1Fgeaa	If you have bruised it put a cold compress on it, such as a bag of frozen peas to bring the bruising out, and I think 3 to 5 days is more likely.

Good stuff when you have asthma or another respiratory tract infection.  It'll do the job.  But as for side effects... You'll probably be grouchy, tired, thirsty, and again--grouchy.  I've taken prednisone, my brother has taken prednisone, my cousin has had it before.  I've never heard of any long-standing side effects.  Unless you abuse this drug, it is perfectly safe to use, and a very useful anti inflamatory drug that will  help with the sinuses, back pain, and anything else that is 'inflamed'.  You might be pretty grouchy (so maybe warn your friends..? And if you're dieting, bad news, becasue prednisone  will increase appetite as well.  Might cause your eyes to focus poorly, but no horrible sort of side effects that I've heard of.  PS: remember that your body chemistry might be different than others, so the side effects are always slightly different in time of occurence and severity from person to person.|`|CuVnpxh3aa	I take Prednisone for my sinus infections. All the cavities in my head all filed with infection and have been for 16 months. I have not been able to smell a thing for 16 months and they can't get the infection cleared up. The Dr said I may never be able to smell a thing for the rest of my life. It all started when I got a digestive disorder and I can't eat food, I eat strained baby fruit and fat free broths and juices so I became and remain malnourished, that's what caused my sinus problem. Now because the digestive disorder has gotten worse I am not allowed prednisone. I never had any reactions to it when I took it before and sometimes the Dr will give me an injection of it and my ENT  gives me a nasal spray of a steroid trying to help my sinuses but it isn't working so he wants to do surgery. I said NO WAY. I doubt your side effects are from the medication but talk to your Dr or pharmacist.
RC5L6AEhaa	http://www.drugs.com/sfx/doxycycline-sid...    go here for side effects hope this helps  feeling tired is a side effects stop taking it and call your doctor|`|cnnu1IFtaa	One of the commonest side effects of doxycycline is nausea and/or vomiting, however if you are not actually being sick you should complete the course, as it is one of the best antibiotics for your problem.     Oh, and having blood taken is never enough to make you anaemic, so it will never make you feel tired or anything like that, although it seems like a lot of blood they take, in reality it's really a pretty small volume - rarely more than 20ml.|`|lFlapW8maa	i am on it too.  ( not for a testicle infection though) feeling ill to the stomach is definetly a side effect.  my doc said to take it with food and dont lay down afterwards.      tired? i am always tired.|`|excWX9bnaa	Try taking the Doxycycline after breakfast and after dinner. Nausea is a common side affect. Also, it is possible that the fatigue may be caused from the infection itself and/or stress. Having the blood drawn would not make you fatigued, not 7 vials.|`|K2SlHrb5aa	YES! I was on it last year when they suspected I had lyme disease, and everytime i took a pill, it made me horribly nauseus, i usually ended up vomiting and i had terrible diarrhea to boot. I had to stop taking and be switched to something else. My mom took it for something last year and she also had to stop taking it as it made her extremely dizzy. If it becomes unbearable, let your doctor know and they can switch you to something else. If it's not that bad, then I'd suggest just trying to put up with it because it's a highly effective antibiotic.
cCZyXV6caa	Yes. Definitely.|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Duh.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	yeah.|`|oXFVRYCsaa	yes of course you can|`|Q5jJ05Qqaa	Of course.  There are a lot of fat people that get pregnant.|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	urm,,, yeah,,, duh!  if you dont know that then i dont think you are really ready to be pregnant|`|uiVEaxjqaa	Every one can get pregnant unless there's something wrong.|`|o2tPN5Geaa	yes, just ask my stepson's fat mother!|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	Ha. Of course. A lot of fat chicks get pregnant. I don't know why so many fat chicks are having sex when I can barely get any, but it is happening!|`|Y6UHIhB2aa	yes you can but I've herd that if you lose weight it makes it easier to lose weight.|`|gs4fwiaqaa	Of course!!! I know a lot of over weight pregnant women. Your weight has nothing to do with it. Hope I could help! [: |`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	Yes, but I wouldn't suggest it. If you want a healthy baby, you should be healthy yourself! :)  Plus, it's really hard being overweight and pregnant. I would get in shape before I tried conceiving!|`|627pWyVkaa	Yes it can be more difficult but only if you have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, hormone imblances, irregular periods, however you can have this and not be over weight either. If your doctor doesnt see any reason why not, However you should try to get in a healthier weight before trying, to cause less chance of complications :)|`|652f1ace7d0e4554d654822f229e8c9daa	?? what do you think? Yeah!|`|Q7kNtNSRaa	Of course!|`|OxDz2Ympaa	yes...|`|5YTWIfFdaa	bit obvious is it not?.... yes you can get pregant even if your over weight|`|TDJsIjfyaa	Off course yes you can :)   Just get ready to gain more for few month's|`|JbDfdJb8aa	So long as you are a woman and fertile, you can become pregnant.|`|aW22FsQSaa	yes|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Of course you can, it's not like your reproductive organs stop working just because you're overweight.|`|zMRElJS0aa	Of course, but there are higher risks of the child having health problems if you are overweight.|`|x1K9OWx9aa	Yes you can. When u do get pregnant it is very important that you that you eat alot of healthy things during ur pregnancy but other wise i would say that you can still get pregnant.|`|pQNB5h8Taa	yes,but if ur very big,obviously your chances are a bit slimmer.  also its more uncomfortable to carry when ur big.
224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Heather, they do these things in order ... your doc is following the recommended protocol and there's no need to worry just yet. They don't go from clinical exam straight to biopsy. Biopsies are expensive, painful, and there is a risk of infection, etc.     Since the lump/area is suspicious, they next do the diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. These 2 tests can often resolve the question of whether or not it is a tumor, mice (? not a term I'm familiar with), cyst, etc. Many suspicious lumps are completely resolved upon viewing in ultrasound.    If the ultrasound/diag. mammo does not resolve the question, then they would probably go to a needle or core biopsy.    At this point, don't stress. Most lumps are not cancer, and your age works in your favor here.    Good luck !|`|3V1U3wxeaa	The first thing you need to do is stop stressing over it.  You let it go for quite a while, so a couple more weeks aren't going to make a difference.  The stress factor can and will make a difference.  You need to eliminate the stress, and stop worrying untill and unless there really is something to worry about.  It is likely only a fatty deposit.|`|M4Ij7Pqtaa	My Mother had breast cancer, and beat it.  She is since gone from Alzheimer's.  But anyway, if I remember right, she had the lump, and it was NOT sore.  That is why some leave it go for awhile because it doesn't hurt.  My Mother in law has cystic fibrosis, which is just fatty lumpy breasts, not harmful, and hers hurts but the doc's won't remove them because they are not dangerous.  The only way to know for SURE is by a biopsy.  Not a mammogram and ultrasound.  They can give "clues" but not a definite diagnosis.  But, these are tests you have to do first.  It's just the way they do things.  So, calm down for now.  Don't stress over something that may be nothing.  Only worry, and then fight, when you have a definite diagnosis.  Mental health helps.  I'm going through the same thing with my husband.  They "think" it may be cancer, lyposarcoma, but, won't know for sure until the surgery to biopsy it.  So, between my mother and husband, I know what your going through. Calm down and wait for results.  Good luck to you.  I'll say a prayer for you too.  God bless.
sbKWMMv9aa	You shouldn't ask "public opinion", you should ask DOCTORs opinion.    There isn't a pill you can take that is safe and will help you lose weight.  People have hurt their health greatly with some products out there, heart and liver disease, kidney failure, skin conditions, and the list goes on and on.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Fat burning pills actually only make you sweat, losing water weight.

We all want that "Miracle Drug" to help us burn fat. I believe this drug contained Ephedra which has been known to thin out your heart vessels and eventually give you heart problems in the future. Some people have died from using this and other diet compounds    First I say look at the ingredients.  Green tea, Cayanne Pepper, Hoodia, now accai berry, alll of these ingredients add up to one thing.  Money coming out of your pocket.    So what you going to be burning up are your cash reserves.    And to think about what are you paying for now and what will it cost your health in the future?    Buy Chinese Green Tea, $2.00 a box. Add some Cayanne Pepper to it, Drink Lemon Juice and water.   If you want a natural fat burner do this....Drink lots of water, 64 ounces a day to start.  Flush your intestinal system and keep it flushing with wholesome fiberous foods, it helps your body detox.  And a clean body, like a clean car engine burns fuel more effectively.      Additionally, before I spend $70 on a Fat Burner, I'd rather run my fat  butt around the block once for every dollar I plan on spending. (including tax)    You are bound to get the results you want, and it won't cost you a dime.    So that my public opinion on this, each time you believe in the hype and you want to put some strange chemical compound in your body, think about what Ms. D said.      Get you running shoes on, or if you can't run, walk at a fast pace and please don't do all 70 blocks in a day.  Swim 70 laps, Smash 70 tennis balls against a wall and run to chase them, run around the court and dunk 70 baskets, run around the park, in the end, doing any one of these exercises regularly, you will burn more fat than if you take that whole bottle of pills...and have a healthier heart as a result.    Then take a look at yourself in a week, if you did it right(which includes make good food choices on what to eat)  it's gonna pay off, then you can spend that money on buying something special for yourself to wear, paying a bill or put it toward your reward of a nice vacation that you always wanted to take, start saving your money cause if you walk "briskly" at least 8 blocks a day for about a week, you will burn lots of fat.    Keep hydrated, 8 glasses of water, add lemon it is a natural fat burner and it has no calories, flavors the water too.  Drink 12 ounces of warm water before going to bed and the first thing when you awaken in the morning and have an apple for breakfast.  (no glutenous bread, rolls, crepes, pancakes etc.) that is the stuff making us all fat.  Fruit and water to break fast with (breakfast).  3 hours later eat a low fat salad.  Put as many healthy greens and veggies as you want in them and a low fat dressing.  Have a sensible dinner.  no seconds.  A Lite Salad if you are  hungry before bedtime.    Reduce or stay completely away from fried foods, breads, cakes, white flour, cornmeal, rice, sweets, sugars, starches and then go green, healthy leafy veggies and for sweets fruit. (Salads and Steam Stir Fry) Know what is going into your food, cook it yourself. olive oil is better than corn or veggie...and absolutely No shortening!    Small amounts of meat or fish protein enough to fit the round part of your palm once a day.  Get your other proteins from your veggies. Spinach, beans...etc..    Reduce caloric intake, say no to foods which take you away from your fat burning goal and exercise with weights.  If you do areobics and exercise with weights alternating between days, you will burn calories just sitting still.  Once you get moving that is..and keep walking.    Pro Plus Fat Burnnig Pills and any other gimmick is something that will burn the fat from your wallet and in the end you will still have fat on you.      We all know there is only one way to do it right and that's exercise, eating right and water.    That's the winning combination and using this system won't cost you a dime.
1WaTRF3Caa	You probably are getting bit by something.  It could be a spider or bed bugs.  Do a thorough search of your bed and the areas next to it to rule out bed bugs.|`|8466ee3d8aec016c639737d732471435aa	It sounds like ring worm -   They don't have a total uniform look but being they are circles and have a flesh tone that is what they sound like.    If you have no clue or disagree go to the MD for a real diagnosis.  You wouldn't be harming yourself though if you did treat it as ring worm (antifungal cream found at the drug store)  and washing all your clothes, bedding and towels. Apply the cream twice a day - and if it helps in a week - 10 days then you nailed it.

This one that left you, he obviously didnt deserve a women like you..   3- Moving on is just like - moving to a new house, pick places that don't remind you of him, DO NOT send him anything else, you have to "disconnect" your thoughts from him...   4- work on yourself, you have a wonderful life ahead of you, you have to concentrate on that.   5- Get someone to talk to , go out to social circles, find friends that you can build a great relationship with...    6- Relive your memories your mother, how proud she was of you, how she will be watching over you in your life, our parents are with us from the day of birth until the day we die, not when they die, when we die, so look up to the sky, & ask your mother to give you strength..  Remember you have another life that expects you to take care of him/her.............. focus on that, focus on your future!  One thing to remember : Never let your past poison your future...   you can do it... be strong...

Concentrate on the positive, and block out any negative thoughts, with positive thoughts such as, I am a good person and I deserve to be happy.   Look to moving on with your life so you can meet new people. Join a club/hobby group, in your neighbourhood, then you will meet people with the same interests as yourself. There will be a single parents group in your neighbourhood. Phone a help line and they will let you know the phone number.

I would really recommend talking to a counselor.  There are times when you just need to cry and get things off your chest in order to feel better.

mWBD1Mgyaa	I had that same procedure done a few years ago - right after that...I got pregnant.  My daughter just turned 2.  As long as everything else is good to go...there is no reason why you can't get pregnant.    I would suggest waiting a little bit for your cervix to heal though.  My cervix was weak and I had to use steriod cream vaginally for the first 3 months.  Let your body heal...and all should be well.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Yes, you can still get pregnant.     The cervix is donut shaped at the bottom of the uterus. It contains the opening to the uterus. They freeze (or burn) the cells.     This doesn't affect the ability to become pregnant. Your cervix takes a while to heal, but it's been long enough since it's been a year.     As long as the rest of your reproductive organs are healthy, you'll be fine. The egg is released from the fallopian tube & then the fertilized egg attaches inside the uterus. Your cervix will dialate when it's time for delivery.     If you don't want to get pregnant you should use birth control.|`|3V1U3wxeaa	There is no reason why not.  The cervix has relatively little to do with it.  Your ovaries and your womb were not affected.  Can you comfortably participate in sexual activity?  If so, then you can as certainly get pregnant as you could before the procedure.|`|nsGBwXCTaa	I had stage2b  cervical cancer and I had to have treatments and now I can;t have any kids I had my frozen off to then a 7years later it came back but they couldn't freeze it so If I was you I would go ahead and have your baby becaues just to be on the saft side and GOOD LUCK

According to many medical care providers, those seeking bipolar control, including those suffering from severe symptoms, have found some amount of relief from their ailments with the proper treatment.  Treatments for bipolar control typically include the use of mood stabilizing drugs, antidepressant, and in a few severe cases anti-psychotics will be necessary.  While the use of medications is extremely helpful, many health care professionals recommend that some type of physiological treatments, such as psychotherapy, be implemented as well. This type of therapy is being found to be not only useful to the child seeking bipolar control, but is also a fantastic way for families to be educated in how to be an effective support system.  This combination of treatments has shown to be quite successful in decreasing hospitalizations, and increasing the patients ability to function better in many areas of their life.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	You MUST take the treatment  You could also join a support group.  You could have named supporters  - friends who agree to keep an eye on you and help you to keep taking the treatments regularly.  With your condition, one of the problems is that you do not always realise what you are doing to yourself, and you do not always understand cause and effect.  Get others to watch over you.

D0JsiC0Paa	Well, first of all self-harming ideation is normal in people with depression, I should know, even if you do not want to consciously kill yourself.      Second, I would look into 'intrusive thoughts' - we all get them, and the reason they're so hard to shake is that we consciously try and not think of them because we are disgusted by them or disturbed by them, but this causes a processing loop in our cognitive processes, so while we are thinking about not thinking about them - we are actually thinking about them because of that. As long as you don't want to 'act' on these thoughts - then that's all they are - thoughts, think about wanting to randomly say something mean to someone you love, you would never do it, but the thought just pops into your head, or the thought of doing something hideously embaressing at a formal event - the intrusive thoughts are usually formed by the free association of thousands of ideas and images randomly flying around in your head with your conscious mind trying to make sense of them - and in your case, if you read a bit on cognitive psychology, there is a theory that us people with depression process things via a negative processing system and if these random thoughts are organized in line with that processing 'filter' it would explain why your intrusive thoughts are about harming yourself in these various, creative ways - it is like your conscious mind trying to find a pattern in a buzz of white noise and you hear 'what you want to hear', not consciously but in line with your mind set - if that makes sense, there's alot going on under that head hood that we are not aware of.    CBT would be a good idea, as it is based on the theory stated above and reversing its effects, so if the therapy is helpful to you, you should find these intrusive thoughts will become less influencial, although, all of us - or most of us - while standing on the edge of a cliff might experience that tiny voice in the back of our head that says 'what if, I jump off?' even though we aren't going to do it, and this scares us - or disturbs us, because we don't want to die, but we were unable to stop that thought - so just remember, thinking isn't the same as doing and as long as you 'consciously' know you don't want to do those things - you're alright.     But Depression itself is still serious, and I suggest you cooperate fully with the treatment; I think it's great you're going for therapy.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Yeah my best advice is just laugh lol everyone has irrational thoughts yes these type of thoughts can be very scary!! but as long as you know acting upon them is dangerous & out right irrational then you'll be OK no matter how much you keep thinking about or fantasizing about it one I do realize is the more you try to fight thoughts that go in your head the more intrusive & repetitive they come.....but I suggest that you tell your family & friends so you can get different perspective everyone needs help & I do mean everyone....but if these thoughts are really causing distress then its time to see a psychologist|`|SHiESc4zaa	I have also had this i think its just a thrill seeking thing.|`|0EmjQjf7aa	well jump out of moving car and when other cars hit you  you wont be having these thoughts again|`|39x9tNJzaa	I do the same thing.  Sometimes I think the only thing stopping me from compulsively driving off a cliff is the threat of permanent disability if I survive.  It isn't because I want to kill myself (well, I do, but am generally mentally stable and don't want to die when I get these specific urges), it really is just sheer, morbid curiosity to see what it's like.    I think a lot of people have a thought or two like this once in a while, and some have many.  Ignore them when you get them.  If you have to pull the car over and wait until they go away, so be it.  If somebody's in the car with you and you don't feel like explaining to them you're trying to not compulsively cause a head-on collision, just tell them you don't feel well. :P|`|0YzP6iOTaa	MISS BROADWAY your ignorant!

I don't suffer from depression or anything, and suicide has never crossed my mind! I'm not a self harmer at all, but still there's that curiosity of what it would feel like.     It happens to me when I'm having an argument with someone in the car. Then I picture that happening to me, and the person who I'm arguing with distraught and crying over my injured body. It's really wierd and odd! I don't like it at all! Because of the circumstances in which I 'fantasise' these, I also think it's a need for attention. Maybe, subconsciously, you desperately need some attention from someone, even if you actually think you get plenty! Maybe you want an adventure, or something new to break the normal trend of waking up, going to school/work, coming home, eating, sleeping etc, even if it means hurting yourself (and potentially others around you, mentally rather than physically).     So to sum up, it could be a case of curiousity, a subconscious need for attention, or a desperation for something to break the circle! I don't know how you can rectify this, but you can try by talking to someone you really trust about it, or to a psyciatrist. You could also, everytime you get these daydreams, take a deep breathe, close your eyes and picture yourself doing something you love, to remind you that you don't want to hurt yourself!     I hope I helped, and good luck!! =D|`|78f0791e6f413b8585f95e827acbae15aa	i have had the same thoughts before believe me, i think is just the curiosity to know how that feels.|`|5C2OAukqaa	Ugh, your not the only one, that feels like this. It really does not make any sense at all. It drives me crazy.|`|f58zeatRaa	Whenever you get those thoughts, flick yourself REALLY HARD on the cheek. It doesn't do much harm, but is really painful and negatively effects your bad thoughts|`|qvl3PjdEaa	Chemical imbalances my friend. I was once depressed.    Still to this day I get DODGY thoughts. Sometimes some proper sick ones I just think woah, an shake it off. But I'm very kind and nice an could never do something like the way I think. I even think what would it be like to jump off a building, or jump in front of a train, an ****... an it worries me.    It's curiosity an a chemical imbalance. I spook myself out but I know I am a decent person so I know I am in control. So ye... shake the thoughts away, say to yourself you are in control, or see a counsellor or have some hypnotherapy and it'll help you out.    Take Care    FX    I hate the way my mind works, but I know I'm good. Hence my brain won't let me do wrong things.|`|LQpU6Zd8aa	talk to your parents or doctor about this, but make sure you start by saying exactly what you wrote here about not being suicidal etc.    Sometimes people have weird thoughts and act on them others just wonder WTF and let it pass. You sound like the latter and talking to your parents may help you with your questions and concerns.    Once about 15 yrs ago when I had depression and anxiety attacks the doctors gave me so much medicine I felt like a zombie then for some strange reason I started taking pins and poking my arms, when the doctor asked me why and if I had thoughts of killing myself I had to explain what sounded weird to me. My reason was the pills made me feel dead and if I poked myself I saw a drop of blood and felt pain so I knew I was alive. He immediately cut my meds way back and within a week I felt "normal" and the thoughts and actions stopped.  Sometimes you can't help what you do or think the key is not to act on them if at all possible|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I dont think it is all that abnormal.  You may be surprised just how many people think the same thing.  It is probably related to depression.  It is a just sign of unhappiness.

I frequently see my self jumping off of a bridge or tower.  I never see myself hit the bottom and have no desire to kill myself.  I'm over 40 years old, so it wont necessarily lead to anything bad.

If you really don't want to see a professional, go a clothes shop with changing rooms and grab a few bras in different sizes (try 32DD, 36D, 38D and others around that kind of size) and see what fits. Or, even simpler, measure yourself with a tape measure. Measure just underneath your bust (so it could be like 34 inches) and then measure around your body at the fuest point of your breast. If there's one inch different to the first measurement, the one UNDER your bust, you're an A, if there's a two inch difference you're a B, if there's a three inch difference you're a C, etc, etc.|`|tFoSy2YRaa	If the back rides up it means you need a smaller band size. And yes, definitely try a larger cup size too, for example 32E.  Bravissimo has lots of good fitting advice:  http://www.bravissimo.com/perfectfit/  Also lots of nice bras there for girls who are bigger up top.  Its a good idea to get fitted by more than one lingerie store, as they can differ. There's no need to be embarassed really, they do it every day and won't remember you.

The bras are expensive, but they last and fit properly. Its worth the extra money to have a really good bra. Or find one on sale. My local VS is having a sale right now, yours might be too.     If you really don't want to be fitted, go to a store and try on a C cup and see how it feels. If it rides up in the back, the straps are too tight. The back strap should be no higher than it is in the front.     The web site that I've cited as my source should help a lot too.

gkqmrIAGaa	The symptoms are bloody stools, constipation or any change in bowl habits. A doctor has to do a colonopscopy which is not a painful procedure, it is outpatient and you are sedated not asleep. It is a procedure of putting a small bendable rod with a camera on the end. While it's being done the doctor who does the procedure can see your colon on a screen to see if there are any lesions or signs of a problem. The earlier the faster the recovery rate  Anything that may be seen by the doctor will be scraped for an evaluation of any cancer cells. A surgury is done to remove the area. If it is just a local area this is the best and easiest to treat.  If it is a larger area part of the colon may be removed, you can live without problems with just a part of the colon removal.  Sometimes it requires procedure in which the colon is by passed with a small bag on the outside of the body to collect the waste. This is usually temporary to allow the colon to heal and sometimes it is needed permanently. This is easy to deal with not as bad as you would think. It depends on whether the cancer cells were just beginning to form or if it has advanced if it has advanced then chemotherapy or radiation is required.  The success rate for colon cancer found early is extremely high. It just depends on the state of the growth of the cancer. If you notice any unusual changes in your bowel habits you need to see your doctor.|`|NvPD6VBoaa	Definition of colon cancer: Cancer that forms in the tissues of the colon (the longest part of the large intestine). Most colon cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).      Estimated new cases and deaths from colon and rectal cancer in the United States in 2008:           New cases: 108,070 (colon); 40,740 (rectal)          Deaths: 49,960 (colon and rectal combined)     A common symptom of colorectal cancer is a change in bowel habits. Symptoms include:      Having diarrhea or constipation    Feeling that your bowel does not empty completely    Finding blood (either bright red or very dark) in your stool    Finding your stools are narrower than usual    Frequently having gas pains or cramps, or feeling full or bloated    Losing weight with no known reason    Feeling very tired all the time    Having nausea or vomiting      Doctors describe colorectal cancer by the following stages:    Stage 0: The cancer is found only in the innermost lining of the colon or rectum. Carcinoma in situ is another name for Stage 0 colorectal cancer.    Stage I: The tumor has grown into the inner wall of the colon or rectum. The tumor has not grown through the wall.    Stage II: The tumor extends more deeply into or through the wall of the colon or rectum. It may have invaded nearby tissue, but cancer cells have not spread to the lymph nodes.    Stage III: The cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to other parts of the body.    Stage IV: The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver or lungs.    Recurrence: This is cancer that has been treated and has returned after a period of time when the cancer could not be detected. The disease may return in the colon or rectum, or in another part of the body.|`|c773a6d9618f1549ce3fc0daab46330daa	Not completely sure but get a good oncologist. My father beat it. It started from his prostate and spread through his body. I think that the cancer cells break off and float about and reattach themselves to other organs and do damage to them.
AUsvrW8faa	Go to an estitician. They have a licensed estitician at the spa where I get my eyebrows done.  I made an appointment and she was able to name the type of acne I had and get a treatment going.  The facial helped get the pores opened so the stuff could be cleaned out of it instead of just sitting at the top causing a bump.  They gave me a twice a day face shampoo, glycolic acid and sunscreen. The facial was $70 - face shampoo was $22 and the glycolic acid was $45 It's pure so I only use 2 very small drops of the glycolic acid - bottle lasts for 4 months at $45.   I'm sure prices will be different where you go but there's an estimate for you.    I saw results immediately which was able to help me stop stressing about my face.  My face is clear, it's only been a few months.

As stress , yes you guessed it causes spots. also your acne could be due to hormones or puberty so don't think your unhealthy. Firstly , try not to use cover up. Or if you do use ones that do not block your pores , also stick to a good skin regime , cleansing , toning , moisturizing , or a skin regimen developed for acne . I would say go and visit your dermatologist. They will give you advice and help you what to buy and they will maybe give you medication and pills. Also , if you are not going to be going out in public or where people can see you , try not to put makeup and cover up on , give your skin a chance to breath. Also , you will likely need an acne cream or benzoyl peroxide ( made for acne and one of the best things for it ) Again , your dermotologist will help you with this. So i hope i have helped and gave a few tips for you.

Athletes can have an enlarged heart, remember the heart is a muscle.  Talk to your doctor and tell hi/her to explain what he/she means.  Some of your symptoms are non specific and can be mistaken for a heart condition but may be actually anxiety related.|`|RY1xuwzoaa	You are having panic attacks, not heart problems.  There's nothing physically wrong with you - and as much as the physical symptoms are real (trust me, I know!  been there done that) they aren't a problem.  The problem is that you get worked into a full blown panic listening to your heart and feeling like you're going to die.  And being scared makes you release more adrenaline which makes your heart beat even faster and its an endless cycle.    The first step to getting better is when you accept the fact that there's absolutely nothing wrong with your body and you are NOT going to die.    Second is going to a doctor or counsellor and trying to find ways to keep the cycle from starting in the first place.    For me, Xanax worked miracles, but you can only take it for a few months or it can be addictive so you have to find something more permanent and healthy than drugs.  But, at least I *KNEW* by the fact that the Xanax made the physical symptoms go away that it wasn't anything wrong but was in head :)    Best of luck - I know it sucks!!  :)|`|AA10301974	You need to find out exactly what you have. Enlarged heart is a general name that doctors generally don't use. Then you establish your limits and fit your lifestyle around it.

On the other hand if your hands and feet are either swollen or fall asleep when you are active, then you have a big problem.
8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.    Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|1f0e6416cfa85891b3ccda8816a22a1caa	You don't need to lose a lot, just make healthy eating decisions (grab a water, rather than a soda... or pretzels/nuts instead of potato chips),  and also try to stay active (maybe take up a new sport..soccer, running, etc. or if you already do one practice and excercise (multi-tasking at its finest)!!!    It's better to be healthy then to starve yourself.|`|WHmTmAb1aa	Drink a lot of water and then eat very little carbs. No soda,cakes cookies, or pies. Just water and vitamins for about a week or two.

My favorite cleanser is mark. "That's Deep" deep facial cleanser. ($7, www.meetmark.com) Secondly, switch to a mineral concealer, foundation, and blush. Many people like mineral makeup because it reflects light and makes your face look like it's glowing. Mineral makeup also covers up blemishes much better than what most people expect. My favorite (and the cheapest) is the e.l.f. mineral starter kit. I have used it for about a year and my skin has changed dramatically!

If you don't take a full course then the strep will likely come back, only it will be resistant to the antibiotics you already took.    Go to a Dr.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	I agree with the above!    This is why so many antibiotics are resistance to bacteria, because people do not take them as directed. There is a reason why the doctor prescribes the antibiotic for the amount of time they do.    Flush the old antibiotic, which probably wouldn't work because it's left over! Go to the doctor and follow what he/she says to do!
yhX02yuNaa	Call your dentist and ask about it.  There's probably still some swelling back there where your jaw hinges.  Dentist may be able to give you something to help that.

Cover it with a bandage and keep it covered until it heals, and don't wear the shoes that caused it anymore.|`|TmY4MPTuaa	You can pop the blister yourself with a sewing needle, old wives tale is not to pop it until dusk to lessen the irritation. Put a bandage on it with triple antibiotic ointment and your set to go!
ZTki9Xh5aa	I sometimes get muscle spasms that are similar to your twitching.  It usually is nothing at all, but if I am dehydrated, it is more prevalent.  Seek medical advice from your doctor for a professional answer.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	Being low in potassium (an example only) can also sometimes cause the kind of twitching that you describe.  The only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation.|`|GAHFiIqSaa	You are experiencing hypnic jerks. They are caused by a spirit trying to get your attention. You may consider such spiritual interactions as a blessing.    When it next happens, try thinking, "hello," to the unseen spirit. You need not actually say the words, as the spirit will hear your thoughts. You will hear its responses in your mind as if you thought them.

newfiOPOaa	Don't do it again.  The side effects can be serious.  Both will lower blood pressure.  Taking both at the same time can drop your blood pressure to the point of having a heart attack.  It can also lead to a stroke.   One condition being a non-arteritic anterior ischemic optioc neuropathy (NAION), which is also called an optic stroke. This is a sudden loss of eyesight in one eye caused by the blockage of blood flow to the optic nerve. The FDAs alert warned that the men at greatest risk for NAION are men who are over 50, smoke, are diabetic or have heart problems.  Either medication by themselves can cause these conditions.  Taken together.........is about as serious as playing Russian roulette.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	if you've done it then you know what any side effects would be already.  what you obviously don't know is that taking them like that can lead to stroke.... stupid move.|`|7e4349dce38654728dc0f4d3d3692380aa	You should be able to tell us what the side effects are.|`|NwBAz9Neaa	The inability to resist anything with legs and sexual organs.|`|ShVxmkO8aa	Why the F would you do that?

aiBOMU9kaa	That really depends on where you go. Lots of optical stores have kids packages that will be less expensive.     Shop around, your daughter has to really like the frame anyway, or she won't want to wear them after.    Look for a full 2 year warranty , none of that 50% replacement cost nonsense like LensCrafters does.|`|170GrvE0aa	Have you tried searching online yet? The pros of buying from an online shop is cheap cheap cheap, as cheap as 9$. A con is that you would have to week wait 1-2 weeks. The wait is worth it because of the price. Here is a good store which I bought my pair of glasses for. www.optical4less.com Mine took 10 business days to arrive but they should vary for each customer. Good luck!

I lost 25 pounds, it clearly does produce success!
yhX02yuNaa	You need this girl like a fish needs a bicycle.  She sounds like a compulsive liar, and she'll make your life miserable.  Just dump her ASAP and deal with the fallout, because believe me, there will be fallout.  But the longer you date her, the worse it will get.|`|VSWl45cKaa	She sounds like she has a lot of issues and hence a lot of "relationship baggage". Her close friends know her well. You would be wise to listen to them. Do you really want to keep on dealing with this. You will never know what is truth and what is fiction. To me it is a personality disorder. You sound young. You have a lot of years ahead of you and thus many people, male and female, to meet in the course of life. Chances are good that there is a lower-maintenance lady out there for you. Concentrate on getting an education and a good job and ther est will take care of itself.|`|Zz1HI5VHaa	Nope. I think it is more likely that she is looking for attention. Think about the example you gave us. She wanted you to feel protective of her and she wanted you to feel proud of her standing up for herself.     There is NOTHING you can do to change this in her. If she wanted to get help and seriously work on this problem it could take her years to sort it out.     You need to ask yourself if you can be with someone who you can't trust. Trust is a big issue and if you don't end up resenting her she may end up resenting you for not trusting her.    Walk carefully.
qMwjrQbOaa	I hope you have already consulted a doctor.  Convince him that medicine will cure him.  You are the adult, aren't you?|`|Tc23KWgzaa	105 is an emergency.  Call his doctor or take him to the ER.    You have an antibiotic?  A full 10-day dose?  And you're sure this is what your son needs for his ears?  I guess you could try that, but I'd rather the dr. supervise that...your son may have a virus and the antibiotic won't help.    Give your child tylenol or motrin if you haven't already.  Get your son a little wet, and then turn a fan gently near him.  It brings down fevers well.    TX Mom|`|AAgX0SDcaa	go to the emergency room, that child could have a seizure with a fever that high. You shouldn't be dosing him with antibiotics on your own, what if he has meningitis or some other infection??????|`|KhvXdMpNaa	take him to the doctor!!!!|`|8HDjHBceaa	Bring him to the docter. or he will die!

If you have to go to the walk in and money is an issue, be sure to tell them any allergies to antibiotics, most doctors Office also have samples to give when money is tight. don't be shy your child's health is to Precious to risk.  the wrong dose of something you already have could do worse damage too.  Good luck  God Bless|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Get him naked sponge him down with cold water under a fan, breaking the fever now is the most important.

If your concerned you could ask your doc. Enjoy it while it lasts!!!!|`|EQydFhzmaa	No, I don't think so - if you have a reason for being tired (like a lack of sleep, which you obviously do not have). Some children/ teenagers need more sleep than adults do, as well as some adults need more sleep than other adults. However, fourteen hours is a little bit too much. It sounds like you could possibly have sleep apnea. I would suggest you schedule sleep study test. If that comes back negative, the reason for all this sleep may in fact be that you are depressed. I would suggest that you see a psychiatrist as well.|`|LjbuONY0aa	u need some counselling dude  at the age of 16 u need to play games and study and should have not more than 8 hours of sleep.  but in ur case 14 hours are a lot u will feel the effect once u cross the teenage...|`|4JXI0pK7aa	Everyone has a different metabolism, so it could just be that, but I would advise going to see your doctor. You could also be a bit tired from the running, but again, ask your doctor. Could also be your diet. Make sure you eat a balanced diet and drink about 2 litres a day. Good Luck =)|`|zWB3jHHPaa	damn what do you sleep, eat and go to school?  try making some friends and leaving the house.. and your 16 and 6'1? thats big lol|`|fff3c3d8688e389a4670babefc9db6ebaa	You probably should shoot from 8 to 10 at the most.

MUnY4O4aaa	Is suffer from anxiety and depression.  I have wicked anxiety attacks that leave me exhausted for days.  The attack normally starts in the morning and goes all day until I can't take it anymore, then I have a wicked attack.  Anxiety can take many forms.  Are you on any meds?  I know that if my meds are out of whack I will have more attacks.  Are you seeing a doctor or psychologist about these attacks.  These attacks can lead to depression because you think you are not complete or totally out of whack.  Not to mention they are exhausting and they take everything you have to try and stay "normal in appearance".  And no one seems to understand what you are going thru.  Trust me you need help and please get some, for your own well being. Hope this helped.|`|bqdeD8JHaa	All anxiety meds are addictive in the sense that coming off them later is nighmarish, just check online forums and support groups for people that tried to stop them after a few years of use.  I recommend you see your doctor to investigate the cause of this anxiety, since certain medical conditions can cause agitation and anxiety and you need to rule those out, but before going on anti-anxiety meds I would first have a few sessions with a life coach and/or a psychotherapist.|`|0YzP6iOTaa	It's rare, but I have had that happen to me. Strangely enough it corresponds to someone dying, but I am unaware their dying.       It's very scary, I would go to the doctor and voice your concerns. There are non addictive meds out there that can give you some relief. GL|`|ghQHUr4Oaa	Yes I know exactly how you feel. I suffered from panic attacks for a while before I took action against them. You often feel like your heart and mind are racing and you have this feeling that you're going to lose your mind, its a very sucky feeling.The way I helped mine was I became open with it. I had to get over feeling like people were going to think that I was crazy, it helps alot when you have support whether it comes from parents, friends or even a psychologist or psychiatrist who can prescribe you something like a anti-anxiety medication. whatever you decide I hope it works out for you.
dkR5XPwpaa	When i was bulimic i had to throw up ALL of what i have eaten and maybe even more ( mostly when i was sick there was a lot of blood in my sick). This is how i would know all if it was gone, because of the blood.   My thoughts were the main reason i kept throwing up, i was fat, it needed to go and go now, if it wasn't all gone, i was failing, and i cannot fail. To mkae myself sick i would do the obvious binge but then eating foods i hated, taking some tablets, toothbrushes/fingers down my throat.    I would go and talk to a psychiatrist or your doctor soon, you don't want your bulimia to escalate, being in hospital is scary, and horrible. Try to get to the root of why you are sick...    Good luck and hope this helps xxx    If you have any other questions then feel free to email me xxx|`|JN76nV3uaa	Eating to suppress or alleviate any type of emotion is what classifies an eating disorder.  Yours may not be fully developed yet but it's best to see a professional and try to work out what exactly causes this behavior in you.  Even if you do stop at a certain limit, it can still be very harmful to your body.|`|EsYBxMpzaa	No once you swallow food it goes throughout the body ,they feel they are throwing everything up but they are not because the food starts to digest before they can even get to the restroom and the reason you are doing it is because you are depressed and eat heavy foods that your stomach cannot digest right away so therefore you feel full ,wanting it out of you to help you feel better is all.|`|4KuLATrNaa	Please stop now. You need to seek help for your emotional eating. I was bulimic for over 10 years. Went to treatment 4 times and figured I would die from it (yes, you can easily die from it).

So, please please get help for your psychological problems before it is too late!|`|fYj3F5qNaa	I am bulimic and I have to throw up until there is nothing left.

I know it's dangerous and I could even die, but  I can't stop it. so my advice to you is get out while you can because although I know its wrong I physically can't stop it, so    you shouldn't start cos you'll never stop. to answer your question,, most of us throw up until there is nothing left, then you throw up stomach acid, and that hurts and damages your teeth and gums, if you use pills sometimes you can start chucking up blood so I wouldn't recommend them|`|LDLTjNCraa	I'd feel like i'm giving you tips if I told you.

PVe6jK78aa	Myth: Marijuana Interferes With Male and Female Sex Hormones. In both men and women, marijuana can cause infertility. Marijuana retards sexual development in adolescents. It produces feminine characteristics in males and masculine characteristics in females.    Fact: There is no evidence that marijuana causes infertility in men or women. In animal studies, high doses of THC diminish the production of some sex hormones and can impair reproduction. However, most studies of humans have found that marijuana has no impact of sex hormones. In those studies showing an impact, it is modest, temporary, and of no apparent consequence for reproduction. There is no scientific evidence that marijuana delays adolescent sexual development, has feminizing effect on males, or a masculinizing effect on females.|`|qnURfWqdaa	yes ....it will make you sterile|`|28qmqsySaa	sure can  yep    good luck  smile|`|YtcMZaUNaa	Smoking anything will cause impotence.

t27SvIPbaa	There is damage in taking thyroxine and there is damage in not taking thyroxine.    You have to take something or your heart may become irregular and the organs in your body will be affected by a low metabolism in your body.    Taking throxine which is a synthetic chemical will lead to osteoporosis and many other side affects.    But there is another option.  First off all if you are in the UK, 99% of doctors do not know how to treat thyroid disease. They only know about Thyroxin which is a synthetic CHEMICAL and should not be in your body. It has many side affects, many dont feel well on thyroxin as you may well find in a couple of months...weight gain, extreme fatigue, frequent bowel movements, puffy eyes and dry skin, and many others.        People with under active thyroid glands who take Synthyroid (thyroxine) should be warned that this drug stimulates osteoclast activity, accelerating bone resorption, and leading to osteoporosis. Natural thyroid medication is available in most countries and is far superior.   Thyroid disease has become epidemic, due to our stressful lives and ill-conceived diets. Soy, in particular, which is used so widely now, suppresses thyroid function and should be banned in all its forms.     In the long term it leads to osteoporosis. In time you will experience these side affects, so please keep the information that I am about to tell you as you WILL need it. You can treat your thyroid by natural medication with NO side affects. The medication is called Armour Thyroid and is derived from pigs glands that have a great success rate. They actually used to prescribe it in this country for people with thyroid disease. Yet most doctors dont even know that, in fact most doctors will not have heard of it and advice you against it while not being able to give you scientific evidence why you shouldnt! Thats because its all about money not health. Their problem with natural products is that nobody can patent them, so the government cannot have exclusive ownership. But they can by making up synthetic chemicals.    What you need to know is that about 85% of people are unable to transfer T4 into T3 when they use Thyroxin. T3 is essential to the function of the main organs of your body. Armour thyroid naturally has T4, T3 and T2 and T1 and it make you feel well with no side affects. Tyrosine does not have T2 & T1. Once you research it at the site below you can order it from the recommended site   http://www.tpa-uk.org.uk/  I was on Thyroxin for two years and did not feel well on it I had absolutely no energy and my weight ballooned up to 19 and a half stone. I started my Armour in April this year and I am now 15 and a half stone with loads of energy. Armour Thyroid helps increase your metabolism where thyroxin slows it down. As you dont know me, dont take my word for your health go to http://www.tpa-uk.org.uk/  Sheila Turner (expert on thyroid disease) runs this thyroid patient advocacy site which will inform and educate you on your disease. There are over six hundred other people on that forum who are taking Armour Thyroid and can give you advice. Pretty soon you will see that doctors know absolutely nothing about treating the thyroid. The are ignorant about it.    Beware of people on this site who are not what they seem, and will try and discredit amour thyroid at every opportunity.  In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by synthetic levothyroxine (T4), or by combinations of synthetic T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed synthetic levothyroxine or T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Of course it's serious not to take them.

Others believe that like fingerprints, each body and the levels of hormone that it needs to function are individual.  However, it is well established that untreated hypothyroid conditions lead to heart disease (causes elevated cholesterol), goiter (a large swelling of the thyroid gland, about where the adam's apple is), difficulties with pregnancy, depression, hair loss, dry skin, constipation....Why risk it???  It doesn't make you any less "whole" because your body needs medication to work right.

tI1NHwfBaa	Crazy!    I'm amazed at the answers people will give based upon opinion, rather than fact.    Condoms are not 100% effective against anything.  Condoms reduce the risk of disease and pregnancy, but they do not prevent them.  Condom manufacturers used to advertise "safe sex," but the term "safe" implies the elimination of risk.  Guess what?  People still got sexually transmitted diseases and still got pregnant, and they sued.  Now the condom manufacturers use the term "safer sex" instead.    For diseases like Chlamydia and Gonorrhea, a condom can reduce the risk of infection by about 50%.  Condoms are actually best at reducing the risk of AIDS; multiple studies by the CDC say that condoms reduce the risk of AIDS transmission by about 85%.  Neither of these figures is exactly accurate, because of the difficulty in testing private behaviors.    Linked below is some information on the studies of condom effectiveness.  It's worth noting that abstinence until marriage prevents sexually transmitted disease 100% of the time.|`|Yh0oQEPHaa	safe don't worry, unless your the unluckiest sob alive you wont get an std|`|a1pmr73vaa	Although no form of birth control is 100% effective, the condom can be quite effective if it is put on correctly.     you use condoms, have a supply available, even if you also use another form of birth control. Its important to have more than one condom because the condom may break when you put it on, or, because condoms can only be used once, you may need more than one if you have sex more than once.    The failure rate of condoms in couples who use them consistently and correctly during the first year of use is estimated to be about 3%. However, the true failure rate is estimated to be about 14% during the first year of typical use. This marked difference of failure rates reflects errors in how they are used.         Some couples fail to use condoms every time they have sexual intercourse.       Condoms may fail (break or come off) if you use the wrong type of lubricant. (For example, using an oil-based lubricant with a latex condom will cause it to fall apart.)       The condom may not be placed properly on the penis. Also, the man may not use care when withdrawing.|`|uzQgWLZnaa	safe|`|hdtNLIIwaa	it's about 95% safe protecting against unwanted pregnancy.  however IT IS NOT nearly that safe in protecting against all STDs, including herpes.  Herpes can be spread by skin-to-skin contact, not just through secretions, and rubbing against each other while having sex, the condom doesn't cover the entire pubic region and herpes can be transmitted.  Although condoms generally help lower the risk of transmission, it is dependent that the areas of transmission are covered by the condom.  know your partners status and make safe decisions.    and DO NOT blow up the condom before hand to check for holes, that can damage the condom and cause holes. that is just bad advice. (see second link for further info on that).|`|8HDQMkSBaa	Very safe unles it breaks....OPPSSSSS!|`|DlgDeCEZaa	About 95% safe as long as you follow the directions on the package.|`|s1HoTYyHaa	i think its 97% or something|`|U2nVrGm1aa	they are 93% effective they are good against pregnancy and stds only problems i guess is if they split or are out of date.|`|YdqE5tSVaa	About 95%...

Women read a lot of romance novels and you never hear people telling them it's wrong.|`|PfCtJgkgaa	I think you answered your own question there. It is the exposure to porn that makes your sex life seem 'boring'.  If you have stopped looking at porn, you are more likely to be able to be highly aroused by the normal female body and human to human physical touch.  If you were to continue to look at porn, you will have to use that as a crutch to be able to satisfy your sexual life.  You will need more, more, more to get you aroused (just think of what your are experiencing now with the "boring").  Lay off the porn and wait for a real woman that excites you.  It'll be all the better!|`|Fq3vo0kOaa	Young man- masterbation is natural............ it is only dangerous when you replace real life with masterbation! Porn is a dirty form or erotica that men & women use to stimulate their sexual fantacies. It can be addictive if you let it, but it can be normal activity if you can control it. You are young, do you have a girlfriend? not that i am encouraging sex with your g/f... but when you arent stimulated in a relationship you look for stimulation elsewhere, like porn or dirty magazines... i have known many that enjoy porn periodically when their partner isnt in the mood, nothing wrong with that, just don't let it consume your thoughts & your relationships with women.... You are a young man, not yet in your peek of manhood, take your time,, life has many things to offer if you let it... Just be in control of your own life, masterbate if you want to , look at porn if you want to, but know when it enough.... don't dwell on porn like its the "only way to satisfy yourself"... because its not...   enjoy your childhood... you will be amazed at the things life will throw at you next...keep your eyes open!! Enjoy life.|`|zqYdkP2Waa	Porn is addictive and can really mess up your life. It's good that you quit, but it seems now you also have another problem. Masturbating can have a bad effect on your life too, and can become a habit. I have a friend with a beautiful wife, unfortunately he has the habbit of masturbating. It has come to the point that he would rather masturbate than have a healthy sexual relationship with her. Which makes her feel a little rejected and undesirable to the point where it causes problems in their marriage. And like a lot of habbits, it can get to the point where you want more, like how you were saying its a little boring now, and then you would need more on top of that and so on. Looking at sex offender cases you will usually find that their need to fill their sexual urges gets out of control to the point that they are willing to risk jail time, their families, friends, loved ones and violating and even hurting others to satisfy their needs and urges. Instead of giving in to the need for more, which is a sign of increasing addictive behavior, you may want to consider how it is really affecting you and where you could possibly be in the future. Sexual addiction isnt just a porn problem. And its better to play it safe and exercize self control than to give in to an increased desire for more.  You may want to look go back to what you read about porn and see if the same wouldn't apply to masturbation. And on another note, if its getting boring (often due to becoming desensitized) then why do it. Have fun and stay healthy.|`|QYDYX9B7aa	NO!    Porn is serious stuff.

If you start getting significant scar tissue buildup on your member then you might want to lay off the porn and the masturbation for a while.|`|4WXK187vaa	Mr Man,    My opinion is that you take up another hobby...something healthier. It is true that in a future relationship you might have serious problems with your wife when she realizes you take away that time from her.    Most of us women will suffer from a sense of loss of our partner and our self-esteem goes lower and lower. WHY? Because we cannot usually compete with the younger girls the partner is looking at.    What saddens me is that it is so available today. The more the person is exposed to it, the more they want it...thus an addiction is born. My suggestion to men that HAVE to do this is to get into a 'swingers' relationship or an open-relationship.This way, porn will not be an issue.    Mystified|`|XSTjyO1naa	Pornography inevitably leads to promiscuous and perverse behavior.

When the cells of the liver become damaged, the immune system responds to this and causes inflammation inside the liver.  If it is caught at this point and treated and the cause of it is removed...it can, at times, be reversed.  If  inflammation of the liver cells continues (this is known as Hepatitis) then it can progress to the cells of the liver dying off and forming fibrosis and then scar tissue inside the liver (this is   known as Cirrhosis).    http://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/art...  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cirrhos...      Depending on what caused the problem, treatment will be started.  There is so much to take into account when this happens. How many other medical condition the patient has...How they respond to the treatment  given...How much of the liver is involved in this...If the patient follows the doctors treatment...what their test results show... if there is a family history of this disease... and more.      Liver cirrhosis is a progressive disease. In some it doesn't advance fast and in others, it does.  The only one who can even give you an estimate of how long someone might live is the doctor.  He has all the patients background and medical tests results.    It would be good, if the patient does have cirrhosis that he be with either a  gastroenterologist or hepatologist for his care.  The best liver test done to see how far advance this disease is, is a liver biopsy. He should ask about possible evaluation and placement on the transplant list, if he wants an organ from a donor.    http://www.surgery.usc.edu/divisions/hep...    People who have cirrhosis of the liver are told  the following:  No alcohol.  Do not take any medications  that are not prescribed or approved by the  doctor.  Tell the doctor all medications they  are taking; this includes: over the counter,  herbs, herbal teas, vitamins, minerals, and  drugs prescribed by other doctors.    Medication has to be adjusted according to  how badly the liver is damaged.  Also, almost  all medications go through the liver first to  be broken down before going to the rest of  the body.   Try to stay as well as you can...  this means the use of purell or other germ   removing products to be used if you cannot wash your hands...you should not be near others who are sick or think they are going to become sick...this will only mean more medications that you have to take and more strain on the body that is trying to heal now.

Make sure that you drink at least 8/8oz glasses of water a day.

You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|9M6UrsYTaa	I have found 2 websites with tips on that might be able to help you.

I'm not starving, I still can enjoy cereals, fruits, veggies, bread and meat. I only eat those in moderation instead of having a piece of food out of boredom.   A great recipe to try out is one of my family's great leek soup recipes..  Leeks are like onions sweeter cousin.   And so, all you need for the easy recipe is; A stock pot, leeks, whole cream, salt & pepper to taste, and water.   The best part about this recipe is that no matter how much cream or water you put in it, it'll taste great and be good for you. Serving size is one cup. Doesn't sound like much but the leeks will somewhat "detox" your body.|`|O8b92k4Qaa	The less processed a food is the better it is for your body.. avoid sugars and fried foods..

DONT drink your calories.. take only water..     Seek information about a vegetarian diet...     But whatever you do.. love yourself.. life is a balance.. don't try for perfect.. just try for what feels good..

I read comments here all the time insisting that every woman's breasts look better when constrained within a bra, and complaining at length and with much hostility about how sloppy, unattractive, and disgusting those of us who choose to go braless look. So then I can only assume that they must think that artificially round, uplifted, and immobile breasts must be their ultimate ideal. And all-the-better with the nipples removed.|`|4uike3ARaa	My own personal preference is simple: I prefer a woman to remain real. I've dated girls who were flatter than me.

vHxauOyeaa	My sister keeps ranting about P90X some training/nutrition plan that guarantees cut abs in 90 days. <br>  <br>  I have been doing situps on a slant board for about a month and a half and that has been pretty rewarding thus far.<br>  <br>  intensity training does sound promising. It adjusts to each person, results may vary because of this, but at the same time should be beneficial.|`|a9BYPzKxaa	I've been jogging/speed walking and it's helped me a great deal.  I jog for about 30-60 seconds and then speed walk for about 2 mins or so.  And then continue the cycle again.  I do this for about an hour 5 days a week.  It definitely helps burn more calories than for example just walking alone will, and at the end of each workout I feel great.  I feel so good after, exercise is truly a natural anti-depressant...it's amazing.  You can also create your own interval training workouts.  For example you can jump rope for 60 seconds, and then jog for 60 seconds, then speed walk for 2 mins, and then start all over again.  You can make it fun for yourself which is what will help you continue doing it, if it's boring then most likely you won't wanna do it.  And if you only do this for 3 days a week, that's still great and you'll see awesome results I'm sure.  But keep in mind you have to keep your diet and nutrition in check as well.  You'll definitely be able to lose 10 lbs in a month, but you'll lose way more inches I'm sure.  So, good luck.  I hope this helps.|`|XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|QbL1TeT7aa	<a href="http://inthis.oyuncumekani" rel="nofollow">http://inthis.oyuncumekani</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check
509b8d2dc8b9cad54992d795f806518eaa	You dont have to be that precise with timing but i guess perfect use (if such a thing exists) is taking the pill every day (apart from in your week break) at a similar time each day, not taking other medications that interfere eg antibiotics or St Johns Wort, not being sick and apparently not taking your pill with grapefruit juice because it can affect its absorption apparently!|`|AA10979261	I think that's as perfect as you can get.

5ypdHLtGaa	your period goes through different cycles where it causes different things (I went through 3 periods immediately followed by yeast infections---that was not a fun phase!). Since the cramps push on your abdominal cavity, it's not uncommon to have upset bowels with it. If you aren't on the pill you should ask your doctor about it. It can help ease the cramping and the sick feelings... i used to be like that with my periods before i went on the pill--I actually fainted twice mine used to be so bad!|`|O3EtP4vOaa	I experienced the same thing, I would recommend going to your gyn to get checked out.

AFBy5aozaa	A cleaning, also known as a prophy, is removing the light to mod tartar build up on your teeth, you should have normal gingival pocketing. aka if you take care of your teeth and gums and visit the dds every 6 mos, you should fall under the category of a cleaning. if the hygienist explained that you need what is called a scaling and root planing procedure this is called a debridement. it is where the hygienist usually scales a little deeper because you have deeper pockets than normal. there is usually mod to heavy tartar build up. so debridments usually cost around the 700-800$ range for a whole mouth scaling and root planning where as cleaning is far less. insurance does cover both procedures.|`|gMzGP7KWaa	Cleaning a wound is simply that washing the area to get rid of the trash thats there. Debridment on the other hand means to get rid of the dead skin which allows new growth to occur to the area. So when someone debrids they are taking away the current tissue thats there. Since this is dead tissue its a good thing.|`|A7lghafHaa	dentally it goes like this  a cleaning or prophy is for patients who have average to minimal debris on their teeth their gums are healthy for the most part as is the bone in the jaws   cleanings are flossing dental hygienist's brushing and a fine scale  a debridement is for patients who have more debris both on the teeth and under the gums most of these patients have generalized gingival imflammation and some bone loss in the jaws    these patients typically have not had any type of dental "cleaning" in a while or the ones they have had were dnoe wel..... not ideally lets put it that way  also any patient that gets a debridement MUST have a periodontal exam BEFORE the debridment to document the disease state  a debridement is done with special instruments and a instrument that shakes and spits out water (alot of water and alot of vibration its called a cavitron)  most of our patients also request a mouthwash to numb the gums first (its a good idea)  good luck!  and FLOSS FLOSS FLOSS
5V5L9DoBaa	When I sprained my ankle playing basketball I was told to rest it for 24-48 hours, and then do excercises to strengthen it for a day and then walk on it lightly the next day.  You do not want to walk on it right now because it might impair the recovery process.  Do not go to school for around 2 days, by the sounds of it it's serious, don't participate in gym, crutches would be a good idea for now. But dont use a knee brace until you get back into sports; you need your knee to do the full range of motion during recovery so that it heals as naturally as it can. Wearing a brace might lower your range of motion and alter the way you walk, run, or turn or jump on that leg.    For now just put ice on it for 10 min periods with 20 min gaps inbetween to ease any swelling. And go see a doctor ASAP if you can, you might have broken it and it might heal wrong, you never know.    Hope this helps|`|nYY4nE9Waa	Do you have insurance? You cannot be sure that it is just a sprain. The only way to find out is with x-rays or an MRI. Go get checked out by a doctor ASAP. There could be a possibility that you tore something so don't play basketball or any high activity sports until you are sure.
nEVoabeSaa	How can you ever be alone? If you look at the word alone break it down you have al one, or all one. If you are your own best friend, then you can never be alone, or lonely. As you get older you will realize that as many people get caught up in work, family, money, they have no time for themselves. Then one day when the kids are grown and they retire they look around and say 'what happened?'.  When you get caught up in life, because you are always running to keep up, you never really notice what is going on around you. That is why the phrase Stop the world I want to get off, or Far from the maddening crowd means, you get so caught up, you never have time to answer simple questions, like Who are You? and Where does this world come from? If you can figure out who you are, let alone where the world comes from, then you will never be alone, because you will have a understanding of why you are here, which in turn will reveal what you want to do while you are here and so on. Those two questions, who are you, where does the world come from can take you many years to figure out and no one can help you. You have to figure it out for yourself, but I think the voyage is well worth it. Best of Luck|`|AA10682405	It definitely does affect me negatively. To where I kind of just don't want to do anything that I should be doing (ie. school). I get a negative view on life, and what keeps me going is hope to find somebody who is worth my time.  I'm sure it is because we aren't meant to be alone. I don't think that we could ever feel complete when we are alone. That's why when we are in love we say "this is my other half" and "you complete me".. because that's exactly what it feels like. We are going to feel like we missing something when we are alone, and of course that incomplete feeling will throw us off of our goals...

mZCWZ3PAaa	you can get them free on prescription from the doctor or local walk in GUM clinic / walk in center but if you want it really quick it costs about 20-25 from the pharmacy although in student areas some pharmacys give it free to under 25s so you might be lucky. at the pharmacy they will take you into a side room and ask you some questions, what your name is, how old you are, allergies, and how long ago the unprotected sex occoured, they might also ask if u where using contraception but theyr not there to judge you or anything they just give u the pill and u pay and go.  it does have the possibility of having a nausia side effect so u'd have to go back if you threw up within 5 hours of taking it but its unlikely.    the morning after pill is called levonelle and is at it most effective when taken within the first 12 hours of unprotected sex although it will work for up to 72 hours or 3 days after but you do want to go get it as soon as possible.    after taking it your period might be early of the 2 times iv taken it (broken condom) iv come on within a week of taking it but it depends.  get your mate to carry condoms next time|`|krZ8RJZzaa	I don't recommend it, I took it once and felt hellish next few days, I was completely miserable.

IUD or other plan!|`|DtG4zpM2aa	Nearly all pharmacies sell them, not sure how much though.  Maybe 20ish?

mqXyDTwwaa	Cut out the 20 - 30 min of cardio every 2-3 days. Just do the warm up. And cut your calories a bit to get rid of the gut. Pro bodybuilders add a lot of fat when they bulk up because they do drugs to lose their fat and maintain muscle mass during their train down. You won't be able to do that, so you need to cut the calories a bit to prevent a lot of fat gain.|`|JsffWlnEaa	that sounds spot on to me...just reduce your calories by 500 and adjust from there.cardio 3x a week at the most.|`|zSkC7hsGaa	That depends on what you lifting schedule is. if you are not doing a split routine you are overtrainig with the weights, not giving them time need to grow, Your cardio is fine, nutrition or lack thereof is what is putting the weight on your gut.

They gave me tranquilizers and the name of a therapist that I really liked.  He told me about this program:    http://TheBestListOnline.Com/cure-panic-...    He really shouldn't have because this program cured my attacks.

AA12358000	bad era fan,  The cause of vitiligo  leukoderma - is not known, but doctors and researchers have several different theories. There is strong evidence that people with vitiligo inherit a group of three genes that make them susceptible to depigmentation. The most widely accepted view is that the depigmentation occurs because vitiligo is an autoimmune disease, this is a disease in which a person's immune system reacts against the body's own organs or tissues. As such, people's bodies produce proteins called cytokines that alter their pigment-producing cells and cause these cells to die. People who develop vitiligo usually first notice white patches on their skin. These patches are more commonly found on sun-exposed areas of the body, including the hands, feet, arms, face, and lips. Other common areas for white patches to appear are the armpits and groin, and around the mouth, eyes, nostrils, navel, genitals, and rectal areas. Vitiligo generally appears in one of three patterns - focal pattern = the depigmentation is limited to one or only a few areas; segmental pattern = depigmented patches develop on only one side of the body; generalized pattern = this is  the most common pattern, where depigmentation occurs symmetrically on both sides of the body. In addition to white patches on the skin, people with vitiligo may have premature graying of the scalp hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, and beard. People with dark skin may notice a loss of color inside their mouths. There are many different treatments for vitiligo. One of these include Tacalcitol which is a synthetic vitamin D3 analogue. It is marketed under several names, including Curatoderm and Bonalfa. It exerts its biological activity by preventing the proliferation of keratinocytes.

I've got these from WikiPedia:      * color of the skin is lighter because there are no pigments      * purple or golden brown patches on and around the eyes, nose, and mouth      * puffiness of the middle layer of the eye      * quicker graying of hair      * more sensitive to sun    Thanks God, I don't have vitiligo so far.

The "way to tell" is if a woman's hymen has been broken or not- is if it's broken then someone's been there to break it, but that's a really unreliable way to tell because there are a load of ways you can break it, like from riding a bike or a horse, using tampons etc and some women's hymens are never complete in the first place so there is absolutely no way you can categorically say from examining a woman that she is still a virgin.

AA11614442	Bell,    Don't be embarrassed by something so natural as female ejaculation.  Some women and couples try hard to get that to happen and are never able, your a little bit special when it comes to that and have an experience that most women never get to.  As a guy it's a HUGE turn on when a woman ejaculates.    Now, anyone who you feel close enough to have sex with should be close enough to you for you to talk about this before you get nekked.  A mature understanding man will probably not only find this somewhat normal ( I have been with around 6 ejaculators in my 39 years), but they will probably find this a huge turn on. A young inexperienced man may find this strange as teen boys don't usually know about this yet, but a little education goes a long way, show him the Wiki article on female ejaculation and teach him that it's normal before you ever go there. This is a blessing ( a bit of a messy one sometimes, but guys are messy too), not a curse.    The first time it happened with me was a bit of a surprise as my GF at the time had never done it before and I didn't even know it was possible. But it was very exciting when it happened.|`|0bHxrymKaa	I dont think its gross. It turns me on. Do you ejaculate when you come? send a pic of it i would like that

XLsnuAqmaa	i have never personally used niacin but i have used CERTO.  trust me....this works.  my friend told me about it and her whole family swears by it (they are all a bunch of low life addicts).  anyway, CERTO is unflavored gelatin.  can be found in the grocery store right by the jello.  it is in a blue box.  you take both packages that are in the box and mix them into a huge glass of water, like a big gulp from the gas station.  drink it before your test.  pee one time after that and then pee for your test and you will be clean.  the gelatin lines your bladder so you don't test poitive for anything.  the gelatin makes the water a bit thicker and a bit yucky tasting.  but i am a chick.  if i can handle it, you can.  i did it for a test a few months ago.  if you have questions, feel free to email me!    no, it won't come back saying that it was messed with.  what is the test for?    let me also add that you seem like a fit guy...  marijuana can last in your system FOR UP TO 30 days, not necessarily meaning that it is 30 days.  marijuana is stored in fat cells so it takes longer to get out of fat peoples' systems.  i think if you don't smoke til your test and continue working out and drinking water you will also be fine.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Drink lots of water to help flush out your system.

xEaiT5Pqaa	Hi love,  Your best bet to to go to a health shop and get good healthy foods that stop you from bloating. Ask them to help you choose. I can't stress enough that the best way to keep the fat to a minimum is to eat really good foods like veg, healthy beans and pulses plus loads a water. EAT THESE FOODS AND EXERCISE N YOUR ONTO A WINNER!!! Cut out ALL crap! Pop, sugar, cakes, sweets, crisps etc. Daily fast pace walking (the type that makes you hot and a little sweaty even when it's freezin outside)   to your mates, work, shops, town etc works better for me than going to the gym three times a week. Do these things for just one week and you'll notice a difference in your body and energy levels. You'll be ready to party girl!    Fasting will not only damage your organs but when you start eating food again your body will aborb and store all the fat it can incase you starve yourself again. Your body will do anything to survive if it thinks you're going to neglect it.     I tried the fasting and it's just bad news. Wrecks your hair, skin, nails etc and you'll end up looking like an unattractive run down rat! I did! Tried enough times to know! lol. It's far more attractive to be slim with a healthy glow!   Good luck chick! x|`|ovi4hOpiaa	Eat something jack A**. I hope you are drinking water at lease. If you dont eat your gonna keel over and die. Not a good way to lose weight.|`|zt0wLQzVaa	omg, its not healthy at all for you to stop eating completely. you can become sick, lethargic or even anorexic. this is a really bad way to lose weight because it slows down ur metabolism, therefore when you start eating more food you will put weight on easily. start off by eating small meals then work your way up to consuming 1200 calories a day. if you really want to lose weight then i suggest you exercise, drink lots of water and eat celery sticks are snacks (they apparently contain negative calories). good luck and be healthy =]|`|bDiPIj3eaa	stop bein paranoid and eat and jus exersise more|`|xjXxs92caa	Just eat moderately.You won;t put on weight for eating a decent meal.Stay away from Fast Foods and your Golden.Try eat veggies. good luck.:)|`|MGOFjVnVaa	you need to go to your doctor. not eating for a weeks is  serious. you need to get help.|`|YSmYkc5Yaa	I hope this is a joke.    You can't just not eat for a whole week. That is extremely unhealthy and not a proper way to fast.    Fasting is used to detoxify the body and cleanse it, not lose weight. And you're allowed to eat or drink proper foods and drinks during them.    What you're doing now is starving your body, which is putting your body into a starvation mode and turning all of your muscle to fat. Secondly, yes you've obviously lost weight because you haven't eaten, but I assure you that once you start eating again, you will gain it all back and probably more than what you started with. There's no way you can keep all of the weight off because you have to start eating sometime otherwise you'll die, and you'll gain weight once you start eating again.    The reason you're not feeling well is because you haven't eaten. And that's really stupid because your body is telling you to eat something and you're ignoring that.     If you knew anything about weight loss, you would know that losing weight actually requires you to eat quite a bit. Eat small healthy balanced meals throughout the day (about 6 or so). It keeps your metabolism running well and it keeps your body well nourished so it can function properly. Also exercise and you'll lose weight as well.    Use your brain. Not eating is extremely dumb.

8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) describes a range of conditions involving the liver that affect people who drink little or no alcohol.    The mildest type is simple fatty liver (steatosis), an accumulation of fat within your liver that usually causes no liver damage. A potentially more serious type, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is associated with liver-damaging inflammation and, sometimes, the formation of fibrous tissue. In some cases, this can progress either to cirrhosis, which can produce progressive, irreversible liver scarring, or to liver cancer.    Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease affects all age groups, including children. Most often, it's diagnosed in middle-aged people who are overweight or obese, and who may also have diabetes and elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels.    With the increasing incidence of obesity and diabetes in Western countries, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has become a growing problem. Although its true prevalence is unknown, some estimates suggest it may affect as many as one-third of American adults.    Because early-stage nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, it's often detected because of abnormal results of liver tests done for unrelated issues. Treatments for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease include weight loss, exercise, improved diabetes control and the use of cholesterol-lowering medications.
Kxwyy0Eaaa	I try and drink a large glass of water in the morning before my morning cereal and coffee because it has been several hours since my last drink and my body needs it. When I was breastfeeding more, both day and night, I would always be drinking water, even at night to make sure my fluids were up for my daughter's benefit as well.|`|4PQOiSfZaa	Drinking water will hydrate you and it's important to drink plenty of it for your body to function properly. As far as drinking water to diet, I don't think it'll actually cause you to lose weight.

You can always go and have a nice time visiting with friends and not get in the pool. If someone asks why you aren't swimming just give them a discreet answer with a smile on your face and make the best of the situation. And try hard not to set yourself up to get thrown in or anything. You can still have a great time at the party.|`|AA10441366	Honey, I did this when I first got it.

Unfortunately there really is no alternative, yet, but you'll just have to stay out of the water. There's nothing to be ashamed of so explain this to your friends.

Have a good time anyway........|`|8514472feccafe6c6c7313aeecd5cbd1aa	well you should not go swimming if you dont want to were a tampon but you can try a pad because when your on your period and go in the water it will stop the blood from flowing but not for long. you can try to use a tampon theres nothing to it and you dont even feel them much or at all. hope this helps|`|bd68880922cf8422f2e38a03cbff0fd9aa	please try tampons. they are so much more comfortable than pads and i guarentee if you are ready to have your period then you are ready to use a tampon. so.. get a box and read the directions that are inside. i like tampax gentle glide and be sure to get some with a plastic applicator. never get cardboard it hurts really bad. all i can say is just make sure you put it up far enough and get it back far enough when you put it in. if you do that then you will not even feel it at all!    swimming-pads+tampons= a great time!|`|AA11348929	well, I hate to break it to you but, if you don't want to use tampons you should not swim.  I am not saying that by using tampons you are doing the right thing by swimming, but it is more sanitary to wear a tampon than it is without one.|`|AA10991881	If you want to swim youhave to wear a tampon. it isn't safe/sanitary. If you cough or sneeze you will leak. you don't want a pool of blood around you do you.     If you want to use a tmpon...    First, buy a brand which has a plastic applicator, not a cardboard one. That makes things much easier. My favourite brand personally is Tampax compax.    Try to find ones which are designed for lighter days when you're just starting out. Yes, you'll probably have to change it more often, but they're very small so easiest to learn with.    When you're going to put one in, you have to relax. Get into a position where it will be easiest - most people suggest sitting on the toilet with your legs wide apart, or putting one foot on the edge of the bath. Personally, I find the easiest way is to crouch down with my knees wide apart.     Take the tampon in your right hand (assuming you're right handed). Spread the labia with your left hand and gently insert the tampon into the vagina. Push it in gently until the fingers of your right hand are touching the skin. That's the most important part - it has to be far enough in or it will be uncomfortable. If you're having trouble getting it in, try pushing slightly to one side or the other, or slightly rotating the tampon as you push it in. If you find it a bit dry going in, you could try using a bit of vaseline on the tip of the tampon.    Once the fingers of your right hand are touching the skin, use your left hand to push the applicator in all the way, as far as it goes - again, if you feel a bit of resistance try pushing slightly to one side or the other, then withdraw the applicator and the tampon should be in place.    If the tampon is in the right place, you won't be able to feel it inside you at all. It's difficult to get the hang of at first, but just keep trying, I promise you it's worth it!!! No more messy pads, no more gushing of blood when you sneeze or move position.......tampons are definitely the way to go!!! Good luck!
prMwhfsxaa	Probably some but they say people who give up both regular and diet lose the most weight for some reason.  Unless you start drinking a lot of sugary juice. Water is, of course, always the best bet.|`|AA11124184	It depends. If cutting the coke lowers your caloric intake below your metabolic level, then you may see some weight loss(eventually)|`|syCbavO2aa	Yes quitting coke will definitely help you to control the weight, but you also need to cut off on other food items containing too much of oil or sugar. Diet coke still give a lot of fat not an option if you want to loose weight. Drink a lot of water and take a brisk walk for about atleast 20 mts. everyday. It will help you to trim slow but sure.
AA10522992	No. Other aerobics work fine.    To plan your exercise regime for fitness purpose, pick one of the aerobics you enjoy, do some weight training either with high rep light weight or low rep heavy weight or mixed, plus stretching routine (pilates or yoga will also do) Remember by doing all 3 to get full benefits of exercise, it's not difficult to get into great shape.

DVmDWDC4aa	Well if you're that exhausted, it coudl be anemia, though rare for males, or something else medical which needs addressing, and you should mention it to your doctor.    If it is merely that you have got into the habit, then obviously sleeping during the day, and not sleeping at night, is a VERY hard habit to break.     I'd personally recommend MAKING yourself stay awake, go out or something, then take a sleeping tablet at the time you SHOULD go to sleep. Do this for a few nights, or a week and your body should have got back into the right pattern...|`|3c69b107d5ca339c6b1746ad0f2379f4aa	I think you should delay the nap and go early to bed .

Sometimes after eating all your energy is in your stomach digesting your food and you feel fatigued (my boyfriend gets like that pretty much all the time).  You could try not eating as much or looking into what you are eating.  Is it something that's high in saturated fat which could take a lot of energy to digest?    I knew this one girl who would go into a food coma after eating soup, that's just how she was.    If you do take a nap after eating set an alarm so you don't sleep for so long maybe an hour something like that so to not disturb your night sleep.|`|hsfdbvF0aa	Sleep more at night  Or see a doctor about it
p4hWHIN9aa	Sure, snake oil. (just kidding)  No, basically she has two choices- padding or surgery.

uuQrhnJ4aa	Yes, it increases carbon monoxide in the blood causing fatigue & headaches.    It decreases oxygen saturation in the blood reducing oxygen delivery to organs & muscles; thereby increasing fatigue.     Smoking's stimulant effects increase heartrate, respiration rate, blood pressure, excess stomach acid, etc.; therefore, your body is working harder & you're feeling fatigue.     Smoking constricts blood vessels throughout the entire body making the heart have to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed vessels; over time the vessels can deteriorate to such a degree that a bypass is necessary (as in the legs when blood cannot flow to the feet, causing cold feet & even bluish/green/black toes or feet). A vein is stripped from the leg or a fake vein created & inserted. Walking or any exertion is painful. Minimal exertion is like climbing Mt Everest. Constriction of blood vessels in the heart requires insertion of stints.    Smoking constricts airways in the lungs. Over time the hair that propels natural existing mucous becomes clogged/less mobile & mucous is trapped & thickens causing bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory/heart failure & pneumonia. This is a chronic condition that progressively worsens with increasing fatigue.    Smoking interferes with sleep patterns & thus, causes fatigue.     Smoking curbs hunger inhibiting proper nutrient intake & interfering w/nutrient absorption resulting in deficiencies & fatigue.    Smoking decreases lung capacity reducing capability for exercise. It's a vicious cycle w/less & less exercise & more & more fatigue.    There are dozens of noxious/poisonous additives to tobacco-causing fatigue...not to mention many known carcinogens.    The chemical reaction in the brain activates the arousal center, craving center, among others...the flood of chemicals leaves you anxious & that build up & let down w/nervous energy causes fatigue accompanied by the desire for more of the same.      Although this list seems long, it's barely scratched the surface.    Yes. These reasons are plenty. If a person needs more to convince them, they've got more problems than smoking.|`|k91hDzu9aa	via proxy yes,  it makes breathing a little more difficult, so then you dont get enough oxygen, your body makes you breathe faster to get more oxygen to the brain, then ure heart has to pump faster to keep up with the blood needed to go to the lungs,    so your hearts pounding, your lungs are working at 90 to nothing, yes, it can be very tiring|`|GGqh73iWaa	Yes it does! When i used to smoke i felt tired all the time and my skin used to get really dry and lined. It starves your skin of oxygen too. Since giving up i feel full of energy and my skin has gone back to normal, even the lines have faded, thank goodness, as i don't want to look old before my time!|`|e1GCbGrXaa	Destroys your lungs will make it harder to get oxygen back into your system which in the long term YES. In a roundabout way

I freaked out when that happened, I thought I might of had a bleeding ulcer or something and bugged my (at the time bf) to take me to the hospital. It turns out they sent me home with a paper saying I got a period. Funny..but they said that is abnormal and could of occured as a result of a possible eating habit change or it might of just been that the egg wasn't released during the first period.

Even Nestle Rowntree have jumped on the bandwagon with their own carb-cutting versions of Kit Kat and Rolos. They join a growing market of low-carb alternatives to foods that are traditionally high in refined carbohydrates, like pasta, bread and breakfast cereal.    According to Nestle Rowntree, the low-carb bar market value has risen to 125,000 from 10,000 six months ago. Sales of Kit Kat and Rolo varieties make up about half of this market.    Carb-bars are popular with consumers looking for a tasty snack or as an alternative to a meal. Seki Tijani, a clinical nutritionist from The Nutrition Coach sees patients who consume up to three of these bars each day, often as a meal replacement. 'Everyone jumped on the Atkins bandwagon as it has done phenomenally well (the Atkins business is now worth 15 billion dollars), so manufacturers are producing their own low-carb and high protein food.'    But is this a trick or treat? As with the fat-friendly Atkins diet, the craze for low-carb is all about eliminating certain food groups rather than cutting quantity. 'It is cleverly marketed - the makers of the bars are saying that you can still have your "naughties" and they won't affect you as they are low-carb,' says Tijani. 'Dieters still want their treats but want to eat something without cheating, so when they eat these bars they feel like they are still controlling their carbohydrate intake.'    Low in carb but high in fat and protein  These bars ditch the carbohydrates, but they are actually no lower in fat than a fully-fledged chocolate bar. A meaty Mars Bar, for example, contains 11.4 grams of fat. The low-carb bars are not far behind, in fact, the Atkins Decadence and Carb Solutions brands contain more fat than a Mars Bar! This bears another close resemblance to 'Atkins New Diet Revolution' philosophy - eat fat and cut back the carbohydrates and your body will eat into your fat stores when the carb reserves get low.    This weight-loss theory is based on the fact that when carbohydrates are absorbed into the body quickly, they are higher on the glycemic index, so blood sugar levels rise and any extra is stored as fat. 'When you eat refined carbs, like white bread and pasta, your blood sugar rises quickly and the insulin kicks in. If you take out the carb, the primary source of energy, the fat will burn as the next source of fuel after the carbohydrates. This is when the body goes into ketosis, using fat as energy,' explains nutritionist Seki Tijani.    Each bar contains 20 or 30 ingredients, from soya proteins to sweeteners, emulsifiers and vegetable fats, but these ingredients don't stimulate the release of insulin and affect blood sugar.        Without carbohydrates, there is no 'real' sugar. But, does fat fill the taste gap? 'The flavours taste fake, you feel unhealthy eating them and they don't taste natural,' one of our taste testers observed. Seki Tijani says, 'Fat gives the flavour or "mouth feel" as it satisfies the taste buds. If they cut out the sugar and replace it with sweeteners, this will affect the taste, so adding more fat will trick the taste buds.'    Neil Ducray, marketing director at Nestle Rowntree, says that getting the taste right is a complex technological process. 'It's partly the sweetener. Getting the right taste profile and "mouth feel" between the caramel and chocolate in a Rolo, for example, is very hard.'    Protein is another ingredient that appears in higher quantities in many of the low-carb bars. 'Protein doesn't stimulate the insulin that causes the body to store carbs as energy and then fat,' says Tijani. Indeed the low-carb packet of Rolos has 3.7 grams of protein compared to the standard Rolos with 1.8 grams.    Kcal comparisons  When it comes to calorie (kcal) values, conventional chocolate bars and their low-carb alternatives would make a calorie-counter devotee shudder. A Mars Bar contains 294 kcal, but Carb Solutions, the 'healthy' bar is not far behind with 257 kcal and Biochem Strive and Akins Endulgence bars are both over the 200 kcal mark. But these days who counts the calories? 'It is all a bit 80s', says Tijani, 'we have moved from counting calories, as we are now a nation obsessed with carbohydrates. We pay more attention to what food ingredients are doing to the body, such as raising insulin, rather than eating less.'    The 'net carb' trap  Screaming out from the all low-carb bar packaging are the low 'net carb' values, a measurement invented by the manufacturers, which is around two or three grams. This is the key selling point for any carb-obsessed customer. The net carbs are the values that actually affect blood sugar levels and stimulate insulin - the 'impact carbohydrates'. Indigestible carbohydrates, like mannitol and sorbitol, which are artificial sweeteners, have a minimal effect on blood sugar so are not included in the net figure.    Carbing the cost  When it comes to price, at an average of 1.69 a bar, they are not a cheap snack. The two-stick low-carb Kit Kat is almost twice the price of the original Kit Kat of twice the size. Low-carb Rolos are 1.59, costing 1.09 more than the confectionary version. Seki Tijani says, 'They know people will pay for them as they have seen a niche in the market and people think they can grab a bar and get a meal's worth - it's exploitation!'    Neil Duprey, explains that the extra cost is down to the expensive sweeteners they use, 'It's because of the polydextrose. We have taken out most of the normal sugar and this is the primary replacement, which costs three times more than normal sugar.'

LbLozopLaa	I actually have his book about natural cures and it is a rip off. He has a little bit of good information in there but for the most part all he talks about is how the government is against him and will do anything to see that he doesn't succeed and how everything is a conspiracy and everything is made to give you some type of a disease so that pharmecutical companies can get rich. Although I can see some truth in his statements he just seems to me as a paranoid schizophrenic who think the world is out to get him. So I can't imagine his weight loss book being any better. His main belief in the boof I have is water and sunlight will cure every disease (honestly it says that) so I imagine that the book you are looking for will say much of the same things. Trust me I thought I was geting some big secret when I got this book and he whines about everything the whole way through it instead of offering information. Save youself some time and don't worry about it..It's not all it's cracked up to be.|`|aN4954l8aa	I like to know the answer to that question also.|`|dd11d84612f26eb85600abb66de386bdaa	You know what?!  I am watching this guy right now on television, and am wondering the same thing.  I actually looked at his first book in the library, and it truly was not helpful!  I spent a couple of hours skimming through the chapters, and he has had a great deal of controversy surrounding his 'natural cures.'  However, my curiosity is also peaked.  I have a feeling that he is following a great deal of what "The Rice Diet" is successful for which is to only take in whole foods, i.e. organics.  I tried it for a week and did very well on it, and you can never finish all of the food that you are required to eat for each meal.  During the first week, you will definitely lose 7-10 lbs of water weight, and you start to gain more energy.  The only reason why I had stopped the diet was due to the fact that it is very time consuming to prepare the meals.  I am planning to go back on it soon.  They have a website, and if you go into the forum, there are alot of recipes, but you really have to enjoy fresh veggies and fruit, or it might be kind of tough to deal with.  Let me know if you learn anything from responses you get to the "Natural Weight Loss Cure," K?

UY29sLbwaa	if you want to burn fat, then you can adjust your running to lose weight.    interval training is a great way to do this. this involves picking up the speed for like 5 minutes, followed by a slower speed for 5 minutes.    also, your diet will come into play here, and it is just as important as exercise! no junk food and soda, and try to eat lean meat. i promise you, you'll feel the difference very quickly.
YPWBwF60aa	Hi there!    Congratulations on your goal!  That is fantastic.  It is always awesome to aim to get in better fitness!    I'm not quite familiar with weight watchers but I have heard wonderful things about the program.  May I ask how often you are weighing yourself?  Please keep in mind that there are many things that influence weight fluctuations.  They say that your weight can fluctuate by a couple of pounds on a daily basis.  For me, personally, I have experienced more than a few pounds fluctuation on a daily basis.  Depending on what time of the month it is, how much water I've consumed, when I've used the bathroom, etc.  You should try and weigh yourself once a week and at the same time.  For instance, if you weigh yourself in the mornings, ALWAYS weigh yourself in the mornings.    Good for you for starting the exercise DVD.  Any and all amounts of physical activity will only help you in achieving your goal.  The basic rule of fitness is that you want to expend more calories than you take in.   That being said, you obviously cannot spend your entire day on a treadmill or doing exercise videos.  So...  although getting in your daily cardio is important you need to understand how it affects your resting heart rate... and your resting heart rate is the major calorie burner in day to day life.    So.... I hope I'm not getting too complicated...  If you were to do 30 min to 1 hour cardio a day it would elevate your resting heart rate for approximately 3-5 hours after your workout.  Excellent right?  That means that your body is still burning calories even after you've stopped sweating.    Now, keeping that in mind, lifting weights or doing any type of weight resistance training for 20 minutes 3 times a week will elevate your resting heart rate for 8-10 hours after the initial exercise.    So after that lengthy explanation.  You need to incorporate both cardio and strength training into your routine and keep up the good work with your eatting habits.      I PROMISE you!  If you keep doing what you are doing you will DEFINATELY see results!|`|nsVbWXKraa	just keep up with the exercise... just try to lose 2-4 pounds a week and keep it off... it is a healthy yet relistic goal.... also cut out the beer, soda, and sugars/candy as much as possible....|`|611fvkn6aa	please do not do this to yourself, just eat what you wanna eat!!  im sure you're not that fat and you've lost quite alot of weight,good on you!!!take up sports coz that's what keeps me FIT!!! im slim|`|HK8ljTyYaa	weight watchers is one of the better systems on the market so i would say stick with it. as far as the work out dvd i would say stay on it for a little longer if you don't see much improvement i would change that some are better than others and at some point all of them will have a plateau so it never hurts to change up your workout from time to time.|`|9XmJPjXvaa	what's your diet?  could it be that you exercise but did not watch your diet?|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Women in particular vary greatly in the water weight the hold on to.

Water weighs a lot and could be throwing off your measurements.    But, i think you should consult a weight watchers consultant seeing as how it's their diet of expertize.|`|QKnKjYzQaa	When you want to lose weight you should not get on a diet or any weight loss program because these are temporary things, you should change your lifestyle. Don't stop eating for a few weeks but eat healthy for life! Don't just workout to lose weight, workout all the time and never stop. You should change your whole life because whatever you're doing is not working out, is it?  For example; one way of working out "always" is taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking your car far away and walking all the way to the store, drinking bottles of water all the time, changing your food habits to fresh vegetables, and avoiding deep dishes when serving your food. Psychologically, people tend to feel satisfied whether they emptied a deep dish of soup or a flat dish of soup. It's all in your mind. You control your mind, you control your body.|`|EvodAqEkaa	exercise, run, any cardio,   if doesnt work... detox|`|mfZJD3G0aa	use Jenny Craig.|`|48de70cee2f6b54ff721ad64702401caaa	its stress sometime can make weight unstable. so think light dont be to stressful and be super happy with everything eat rite and do as u do exercise daily.|`|kkOYCHpgaa	best way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you consume.  eat healthy foods, avoid sat fat and too many carbs, stay away from high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated oils, eat lots of fruits and veggies, ditch the weight watchers program, you just making somebody else rich.  try eating organic foods and try eating 5-6 SMALL portioned meals a day to combat hunger|`|MvY4iOaQaa	yo know i was on weight watchers too till just today i went back to counting calories because i was always either hungry or kinda sick feeling on it and wasnt losing weight. now im 5'4'' and only 125, i was just trying to get back down to 120 and after 3 weeks of weight watchers it just wasnt worth it anymore.

Also, water retension can make your weight vary by five pounds. You just need to keep at it. Usually women do hit a point where it takes a while for their weight to change. Does this work out dvd include cardio? or is it like pilates and muscle toning?|`|kNhYFgCTaa	That is most definitely water weight and or food in your body.    your weight will fluctuate up and down between days, the important thing is the actual fat that comes off.    and its simple really.    burn more calories then you consume.     there is no "plateau" for anyone. you just have to change your plan a little. that being said do not stop eating too much, or else you will be repayed with weight gain.    try lowering what you eat a small amount every day. see what works for you
PAvYZJK2aa	no it does not!|`|TsjqzanQaa	No.    Circumcision is male genital mutilation, and damages the penis, sexual sensitivity and sexual ability.    It was used about 100 years ago to try to prevent masturbation, as it greatly decreases the enjoyment of masturbation and sex, but it didn't really stop boys from masturbating at all.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|kprKXEOSaa	They should do a study on this.  The only problem will be finding a bunch of adult, uncircumcised men who would be willing to undergo the procedure, and then make some comparisons.

Good luck finding the participants for that study.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	No, that sounds like the propaganda put out by the pro - genital mutilation brigade.

It sounds like some of the unfounded hype and propaganda spread in the late 1880s when John Harvey Kellogg was trying to find reasons to promote circumcision.  He made all kinds of claims for medical benefit including curing epilepsy and mental retardation.  We know it does not cure mental retardation because people are still circumcising their helpless infant sons today.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Nope it doesn't.    -Connor|`|3TsO2UWRaa	i dont plan on finding out lol =P  and i dont wanna google info cuz i dont want pictures D=|`|91W8HrJiaa	Obviously you are not only circumsized but delusional.|`|x5tAxZR8aa	Well, I'am no expert but I guess it can slow down your sex drive and make you be more aware of things around you that are happening then you wanting to get into your boss's pants.|`|B8e8x60Saa	no it does not.. the only thing you do get is..you enjoy sex a bit more... its proven (MEDCLY).. oh and it clean.. a bit safer (i doo stress a bit) and gurls like it.. wel thats what they'v told me :)|`|N8lnHXunaa	No not true...just a myth|`|4arnbpUCaa	Of course not.

wfTIp8SBaa	Acne is one of the biggest problems for teens these days. Everyone is so worried about it, I was worried about it a few years ago. Whenever a teen saw a little bit of red, they went right to the dermatologist. I knew some people that got these medications that only made the skin feel worse, and not better. It made their skin look like disaster areas!!! However, I managed to keep my skin clear, and never went to a dermatologist once. What's my secret? Here it is:     -Over-The-Counter Remedies-   *I tried some, but the ingredients in some of them scared me... Also, some are very bad for your skin. I once tried Clearasil pads just recently, and they actually did work. However, they seemed to irritate my skin quite a bit. Plus one of the main ingredients was the stuff they use in wart medications. So all in all, these remedies don't really work as well as some other safer ones. Another drawback to these is that they are very expensive, and very many don't work. the best brands however are Clearasil and Biore. Most others are just trash. Remember, it's easy to make a mistake, but not to fix one. These things can damage your skin possibly.     -Dermatologist-   *I know someone who had moderate acne that was quite visible. She started to take prescription drugs to treat her acne. It made her skin peel for a while, but then the acne began to subside a little. However, it never went away, and it was still visible. So in conclusion, the drugs seemed to iritate the skin worse, rather than making the acne go away. Then, she discovered the remedy that I used, and her face became clearer.     -The Right Stuff-   *So, what's the stuff that works? My favorite soap does, Dove soap. It's not a deoderant soap which can irritate the skin. I've seen people who used a lot of deoderant soap on the face, and it made it very red, it made them look terrible for a little while. However, soap dries out the skin. So, if you have a lot o redness, just wash that area 4 or 5 times a day. I wash my face twice a day. It keeps me from getting acne. So, get Dove soap, it is without doubt the best soap on the market.     -A More Aggressive Approach-   *There is one other cheap aggressive approach which is quite unhealthy. Rubbing alcohol. You can purchase a large bottle from some place like Walgreens for $.99 on sale. Alcohol is capable of drying up the skin very quickly, it kills bacteria, and makes the acne go away. Alcohol is a cytotoxic agent though, and therefore kills cells on contact. So, it may be doing more harm than good. Only use in desperate situations, or once a week... Try to use alcohol as little as possible.     -In Conclusion-   *The best way to approach acne treatment is the safe way without drugs. Use Dove soap, and lots of it. When your skin is greasy, it becomes red. When it's dry, it becomes normal. Dove soap and rubbing alcohol dry it up nicely, and make the acne away. But, try to stay away from alcohol though, it's cytotoxic. Also, try to stay away from over-the-counter ointments, or atleast some, because they are very bad for your skin. Good luck! Remember, Dove soap is the silver bullet!|`|RqB3QOwoaa	Actually turn the water on when you shower...|`|544c69cf26e051bee81a01a26428a308aa	wash your face with hot water and use a good cleanser, like Noxema. Try  boiling a pot of salt water and holding your face over the water's steam to open up your pores! I hear proactive works good maybe you should try it. Good Luck!!!|`|9412bba12eb158737113a1bb3031a0fdaa	use a antibacterial soap for your body and eat fruits and vegetables, and drink plenty of water.|`|ff9305ee730e83c843f50cde1ca8920caa	A great way to extinguish acne once and for all is by visiting a dermatologist and getting a prescription for a medication called Accutane.|`|AA12166394	Sadly, you can't "get rid of" acne. There is no cure for it. I also have suffered in the past, until I started using Proactiv, and have been blemish free ever since, over 7 years now.    Good luck!

AA11557192	It looks like 1300 to 1800 calories.    http://www.hpathy.com/healthtools/calori...|`|xJzT2uEfaa	To figure out your needed caloric intake, you need to figure out your bmr and then need to use the henry Benedict equation to find out how many calories you need a day....    1) Calculate your BMR  This is your base number of calories a day you burn just by being alive and doing activities like breathing.    Women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)    Men: BMR = 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)    Harris-Benedict Equation        * If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.2      * If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.375      * If you are moderatetely active (moderate exercise/sports) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.55      * If you are very active (hard exercise/sports) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.725      * If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.9    For example, since you are a 26 year old woman who is 5ft5in and 110pounds, your bmr equation would look like this.....  BMR = 655 + (4.35 x 110) + (4.7 x 65) - (4.7 x 26)= 1316.8    now if you are sedentary, you would take that number and multiply it by 1.2.....which would equal 1580.16...that number would be the amount of calories you would need to take in in order to maintain your weight if you are sedentary (if you are trying to lose weight or gain weight, just figure out how many calories a person that size would take in by using the same formula, and start eating like you are that size so that you can train your body to eat only a certain amount)|`|0wj1qn9Caa	Calories is a big topic when it comes to weight loss.

OtiTiVDNaa	hi, doing cruches and different abs workout won't flatten up your stomach it will just build the muscle ( abs) inside to an invisible six pack hidden behind the layers of fat , to get rid of the fat,you have to :  1.jog for about 25 minutes and then sprint as long as you can  2 Repeat this cardio for about an hour -sprint jog/ jog sprint/print jog.  3 drink lots of water  4 eat proteins   my experience only two weeks are required but its intense and hard anyway i hope u can stick to it.    Good luck!|`|hY0cb2xRaa	Do abs exercise.. I am not sure how old you are.. but do yoga/pilates.. Jennifer Kries Pilates abs workout works the best. All the best !!!|`|zJzUjYeTaa	you need to find a good ab workout. Whatever works best for you.  Then whenever you are sitting anywhere. ex: watching tv, at school, work... Just tighten you stomach muscles as long as you can then release. that doesn't take much effort but it really works trust me. I have abs of steal from doing that.|`|NRfs81Raaa	If you have some fat on your tummy right now you will need to lose most of that before you will start to see the muscle beneath. That can be done in many ways, but the best way is through cardio/strength training circuits. Doing workouts that incorporate weight lifting exercise that hit many parts of the body (squats, lunges, push-ups, sprints, etc.) plus cardio will burn the most calories and get you toward your results as fast as possible.     example workout: sprint 400 metres, do 50 body weight squats sprint 400 meteres do 50 push ups. Repeat 10 times and try to beat your time every time you do the workout.     Doing full body exercises like this will actually build your abs faster than traditional situps and you will lose fat at the same time.    Then you will need to think of what you are eating. Cut out all refined sugars (soda, alchohol, chocolate, etc.) and flours (breads, pastas, etc) and don't be afraid of things with fat in them. We need to have a good balance of protein, carbs and fat in every meal. Start reading into healthy eating while you are working on doing your workouts to the highest intensity possible.    Good luck|`|CzS1EiV9aa	You already look good, stop being greedy.
yyIVrngcaa	Wow, tell your parents you want to be healthy and Have a nice body, you know what you're doing and what you're aiming for, and by them forcing junk food in your face your not gonna achieve those goals! they need to understand, it doesnt matter if they're getting hurt by you not wanting the food they're throwing in your face, you just stick to your diet, something is wrong with them if they want you to turn out as overweight as they are...how selfish and immature they are.  Be strong and stick to your diets!  good luck and best wishes|`|oGFNIQdIaa	tell them that the only way u can be happy is my respecting ur like style... and love shouldnt be proved with food , cakes... etc...and instead of eating those u will rather prefer have a nice familly evening at tv , play some game .. or any other nice activity with ur parents and sister... but do not exagerate with the weight loss ...cause of the anorexic episode ur familly is like this... its a form of protection... take care and good luck|`|OLTjkS4zaa	I would just tell people "No thanks I am really not hungry" or "that doesn't sound good right now but thank you any way"  It's hard I know.  I sort of am opposite of you with the same thing happening.  I am trying to loose weight and everyone around me is skinny and can eat anything they want.  I am always hearing "oh one bite won't hurt you" but for me it will because I am an over-eater and I know that so I try to use those lines I mentioned.  Most of the time it works.  One thing you could do it try to take over some of the cooking in your house and try healthier recipes.  There are lots of good web sites available. Good luck and stay strong.|`|OItPJZjBaa	Well, it sounds like they might be afraid that you might go down the anorexic road again.

Best of Luck to You and Your Family:)|`|3h0YURvSaa	How old are you?  either way you do need support in weight loss.  My sugesstion is to first love yourself.  pick a favorite body part and decide on toning that area. The reason is it diverts you from feeling hopeless and overwhelmed.with losing weight.  gradually start to cut down on sweets,or unhealthy foods, snacks.  I think depending on your height size 10/12 is a good size,  Please set realistic goals for yourself.  Rejecting food or snacks shouldn't make you feel bad...just say I am ok or I just ate. When you hurt nobody but you feels it so be your own friend and stand up for your health.  Good luck!|`|6sPcYQr0aa	You need to let your family know that you are seriouse by not giving in. It is that simple. If it hurts their feelings their minds have been misguided by the devil..lol Do what you need to do to become a healthier you. If your family loves you they will help once they know you are seriouse.   It doesnt really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|zJzUjYeTaa	You should definitely start running. Running is the best exercise for weight loss. Don't waste your time doing sit ups or crunches they don't work in your case.

CRhS02q8aa	windex|`|Z9360MMxaa	You can't "take out a pimple" you can get rid of one though. If it looks like it's at a head, a white dot, clean your fingers and gently pull the skin APART. Many people say to pinch it but that leads to scarring. Pull the skin apart until the white stuff comes out, apply pressure to stop any bleeding, then apply some ointment. There are several types of ointments the most common being Salicylic acid compounds and Benzozyl Peroxide. I find Benzozyl Peroxide to work faster and more efficiently. Be careful how much you use as it can irritate skin and also stain/bleach clothes. If you are left with a red dot after the pimple has disappeared use some Neosporin that has vitamin e / zinc to help the blotch disappear.|`|6HMgT5LCaa	Pop it.

Best.|`|dkEUJPhnaa	You've gotten into the habit of doing the same routine day in day out, which is laying down in bed not doing anything. The longer you do this the harder it will be to actually get up and make changes to your life. Well you don't know what to do with your life but you obviously can't carry on like this - I think you need to seek advice from others in this case. It also depends what area of your life you're talking about. Do you want a new job? Look for ads in local newspapers or talk to a local careers adviser if you have one. Don't have a social life? Invite a friend or two round your house and come up with exiting new things to do in your spare time that you've never done before. Looking for a new partner? Go on dating websites (make sure you're safe with this), go to new social places and get introduced to new people. I also think however that you could have depression. It's very hard to change your life when you feel like this so make an appointment with your doctor and get that sorted out. If you ever feel down make sure you always tell someone so you're not keeping your feelings bottled up. Also, maybe you could get a new haircut or buy new clothes. Make yourself feel different and fresh and you could even do some decorating around the house. If you've always wanted to do something, like bungee jump, then get a part time job just for that purpose and save up for it. Life is yours, experiment with it and try out as many things as possible. Good luck and stay positive.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	You need to get motivated again by rewarding yourself or finding something that you enjoy doing.  I would recommend calling a friend or family member and letting them know that you need a pick me up.  If that doesn't work, lay there for a few hours and vow that at a certain time you will get up.  Do little things to get motivated again.  Take 10 minutes to pick up your room or go for a walk.  If you still feel this way after a while, you may want to talk to a counselor, psychiatrist, spiritual leader or doctor.  I know it's hard but you can take charge again.  Just don't expect too much from yourself all at once, take your time and give yourself rewards along the way.|`|N28zLxtpaa	Talk to your doctor about depression meds.|`|0byq7c1maa	well it could be depression but as a first step try some protein it could be hypoglycemia or some other blood sugar or physical disorder.|`|NkHGx4cdaa	Im pretty much the same. my life is close to nonexistant. what helps me is reading.|`|iDEIbM5laa	see a specialist  force yourself out of bed and tell a psychologist  paint, draw, sing   any way of expressing yourself can help at difficult times|`|ZwECcnh1aa	Im in the same rut.

73d5ba18994a20c60c9c3499c1bbf233aa	I saw no research on the dangers of shaving legs on the internet -- trust me, not even whack-job sites showed up.  This person who told you this is just anti-shaving and came up with a crock of dookie to scare you out of it.    Shaving removes the hair at the skin line.  If you soften and warm your skin (like in a bath) with warm water, the hairs will extend more, so you get a closer shave.  While some people can get infections from ingrown hairs at one's underarms, most women have no issue at all.  One can get lymph node infections there.    Below is just about the only "dangers" site I found for shaving is this one:    http://www.beautyden.com/hairremoval.sht...    "Risks: The only real risks involve nicking your skin by shaving carelessly. If deep enough, those nicks may cause scarring."    While sometimes hairs can become ingrown, considering so many women do shave their legs and there isn't an outbreak in bone, pore, and muscle problems, I'd say no.    My best answer?  Ask "someone" to cough up the study or article with references.|`|4cbaa60864ff23f71b572e932878353daa	They're saying that it is dangerous to your health which is not true.

Healthy carbs are good for a healthy diet, just make sure they are whole grain, high fiber. A potato with the skin has a ton of vitamins, minerals and is under 100 calores.

vukRiS1Eaa	First off, congratulations for being brave enough to ask about this. It's easy to get embarrassed and then not find out what you need to know!    As for ways to do it, you have several options:    1. Fingers. They're the old standby, and they work. Focus on your clit--experiment with different speeds and pressures. Start by rubbing lying on your back, and then try lying on your stomach and grinding your hips to rub against your fingers. Experiment, and know this is how most women try it for the first time!    2. Showerhead/bath faucet. A favorite of many girls. If you have a detachable showerhead, simply adjust the water temperature, lie down in the tub, point it at your clit, and enjoy! Note that the lying down part is important, especially if you're new to this--don't want to slip!    3. Vibrator. You could go get one from a sex showp--However, take a look at those "Face massagers" and "Back massagers" at Wal-Mart--believe me, they will do the trick. Again, focus on your clit (are you catching the theme here?).    Sex is far better than masturbation...but just like anything, it takes practice.  It probably won't be amazing the first time with someone, but as you get used to each other it will get better and better.    Above all else, have fun!|`|uQoBeM0Xaa	a woman lol how old are you?? 13 O.o     anyway, masturbation can be better than sex but it depends.

Your mind begins to control you, instead of the reverse.  Action becomes frightening, inaction a recipe for disaster.  Like a volcano, all the things that make you have been bottled up and it's frighening what happens when you lose control.  So, do you have any trusted friends?  People that genuinely love you?  Go there first.  If you have a source of love, it it your greatest asset.  If you lack this resource, seek outside help, and in fact, there may be the need for professional help anyway.  In this crazy world where we slaughter each other in the name of God, it's a miracle anybody can cope.  With the billions of choices we are seduced by from advertisers of every sort, who can we clarify our minds?  When our parents more often than not never settled their issues, how can we hope to clarify ours?  And when death is never more than an instant away, how can we not be a wee bit frightened.  Good Luck, my friend.  There is so much to life I hope you can find some enjoyment!  One more thing, don't give up.  You are not alone, there are millions of us out here, just like you and if not for the love of friends I don't know that I could even get out of bed...really, reach out carefully to those you trust.|`|kIblsxJQaa	I cant add really to the answers you have already been given and am so glad that you didnt get any abuse to your question.

You need to see your doctor and explain how you've been feeling (you could print your question out and take it with you because I bet you put a lot of thought into what you wanted to say here).

Don't feel bad about doing it- 1 in 4 people have problems of this kind at some point in their lives.

dc4383215651140fd211f40b1cdf9a29aa	Dude, be careful! I had to reopen my e-mail account because they cancelled my last account because of violations. I'm not joking, I lost all my addresses and pics.    Evidently, if anybody is offended by anyone's Q. or A. they simply report you and your Q. or A. is automatically removed and you get a violation notice.    I seriously doubt an actual human being screens all the "reports". And if you get enough, they will cancel your e-mail account.    What I did that pissed so many people off is I repeatedly put "Muslim" and "terrorist" in the same sentence. I was so ammused by all the politically correct idiots calling me racist, hateful, ignorant, insensitive, etc. My favorite is when they called me a Klansman.    So now I'm gonna leave the ragheads alone and direct all my  anti-tolerance to the anti-tolerant p.c. retard's.     What would a politically correct person say before a hateful, vengeful, intolerant, racist Muslim cuts his head off with a pocket-knife?|`|c782a10346ab6506b59db470284f0f8daa	Nope, dude, but bet u do.|`|d0f7c5fa50c64506fdf54d8284d27e59aa	nope|`|AA10991881	No|`|AA10845617	no|`|d16af95fe11dc44756e9a037db8578b2aa	WoOoOW I think most people will start to seep out organs before this ever makes sense!!!!

RvXwjC7Yaa	a piece of toast or some cereal is fine for losing weight, if anything, these two dont put any fat on you and with exercise you can stay in fantastic shape, the only thing you should'nt have is cooked breakfast, the usual toast and ceral is perfectly fine|`|5oNwMqMiaa	Don't get too caught up with calories or weight honey, concentrate more on feeling better in your clothes.  The best brekkie for you is porridge with skimmed milk or water.  Chop a banana, some strawberries (in season) or a kiwi fruit in to it to get one of your 5 a day.  Rather than snacking on cereal bars and such, make fruit your friend, it's a healthly, tasty and nutritious snack.  You will require more food when you go to the gym, don't panic if your appetitie increases, it's normal.  Just make healthier choices and you will tone up in no time.  From your weight and height stats it doesn't sound like you need to lose any weight at all, but toning up is great for everyone.  Make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, herbal/fruit teas etc.  Steer clear of sugary juices and soda, but have diet if you must.  Aim for around 2-3 litres of water a day especially on the days when you go to the gym as your muscles need the water to repair themselves.  Believe it or not, drinking water helps your body stop retaining it, which is why at the moment you might be gaining water weight, you might not be drinking enough.  If you need more advice, ask your fitness instructor at your gym.  Good luck :-)|`|lxeGKjLbaa	Something with protein that will keep you from getting hungry Cold cereal with oats or muesli with yogurt are both good, they don't have to be cooked. You might think the calories are a little high but I worry more about fat content, of which these things have very little. If you are going to the gym that much I wouldn't worry about calories, just fat intake cuz you're burning the calories at the gym. Fat is harder to burn.|`|dbe0ao9Vaa	My mum is on a diet also and she eats a lot of parsley.

It is incredible the things the media digs up and I am almost one hundred percent certainthat they would have composed an aticle on him being mentally retarded if he were.    I have read this article however, which whther I read it or not, I had all ready deduced that he has quite a brilliant mind. You can see before he starts the race, he prepares himself in a way I have never seen before and he goes into a state of mind rarely entered before - certainly not by any former or current athletes. It is in this state of mind, where his sucess underlies - haven't you noticed how deep inside himself he goes to achive his fanatastic concentration?? I am sorry, that was pathetic but the best I can explain - kind of tired now =P    Well, I hope I helped, nevertheless. If I haven't, I only wish I could return these points.

Therefore, you got to outweigh the benefits and its harms carefully before making any snap decisions.|`|AA11785060	So you are 6 ft and 14.  I was 5'10 and 15, and still that same height as an adult. You may simply be close to your adult height, and not grow much more at all.  Unless you are abnormally much taller than your parents/grandparents, nothing to worry about. If you are growing really rapidly and they are all short people, then have your parents take you to an endocrinologist to get checked  out.  He can do something if there is a problem with unchecked growth.    More likely you will grow another couple of inches over the next year or so and be done.

The I have seen were there are a few who are just big they have something wrong with a gland in the body that controls growth.

Pmb0MeB8aa	For that price, I'd go and I DON'T have diabetes. Yes, your brother has a point...it isn't rocket science. But a lot of dieting is counter-intuitive. A dietitian would not only tell you what to eat, but how much of it to eat each day. She could give you caloric goals and develop a diet that will combine with your exercise plan to not only get your weight down, but make the weight you have muscle and lower in fat. And that part of it is closer to rocket science. I mean, he/she probably holds a Bachelor's or Master's degree in food and nutrition. A dietitian is a wealth of knowledge and can give you information and tips that will help you for the rest of your life.    Go for it.|`|f51d44e105a2a3f4397e420c549a4437aa	I strongly agree with Be More.  If you are already pre-diabetic, then learning how different foods can affect your blood glucose levels is important.  It's more than just not eating common sugary foods.  It's how different carbohydrates will affect your glucose levels in different ways, how fiber helps, and learning about other "hidden" sugars in food.  My mom has to be careful with dairy, as the lactose in one cup of milk will cause her to have a blood glucose spike.  Learning how to regulate your blood sugar with diet will help with weight loss.  Its basically a win-win situation.  Good luck, and I am glad you are actively trying to better your health.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Seeing the dietician can't hurt, and may have some information for you that is useful, plus with the rebat why not?

If anything, they sound like a possible autoimmune disorder.         Of you're worried, get tested. Simple as that.    The ache sounds like an inflammation problem. Either joint or muscle related. Pregnizone will take care of that. Or cortizone. Rashes are usually viral or bacterial in nature, though they can also be the result of an alergic reaction. Have you changed your detergant or soap lately?    Fever means infection. You were sick.

T6nmD3X9aa	When you get to work, request a meeting with your boss. Explain to him your borthers medical condition and apologize for any inconvenience he caused. Tell him that you are trying to get your brother some help but with his age, it is hard to do unless he is a danger to himself or others.   You mentioned he is in the hospital now, hopefully they are getting him on some medication that will start working within the next few days.   You may want to go and see him in the hospital, maybe see if they will do a family meeting with a therapist on staff to see why he is directing all this toward you.   During the manic phase of bipolar, it is difficult to get them to understand. Their thoughts are racing so fast, its like a constant high and you feel very in control, very justified in your behavior. If he is on meds, it will begin to regulate this soon.     good luck to you. please remember, it is not your brother, it is his illness.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	I agree with the other answers, be honest with your boss and the HR department.  Being up front with them will go a long way.    Call your friends and let them know what is going on with your brother.  You can use all the support you can get right now.    Once the doctors get your brother on the proper medication it will help.  Going forward, watch for signs that he is cutting back on his medication.|`|aXyphZvYaa	I have a schizophrenic brother who has done similar things.  This is what you do.   You go to work, and explain to your boss that you have no control over your brother and have asked the hospital that he is in to not allow him to make the calls, but can not. You make it a point to tell your work that you love your brother and continually have to be very patient with his antics.  You can tell them that if they choose to have the receptionist block all his calls from getting past her desk to do so.    You speak openly as a day to day conversation to your coworkers.  Plain as day.  Your friends.. they should already know about your brother, and if they dont, tell them.  All of it.   If you accept this as a part of your life.. and something you will forever have to deal with, in time, you will eventually not let any of this bother you, and it will be natural to just answer any questions that pop up.    I really to feel for ya, I remember that sinking feeling of ..oh god.. what did he do..or say.  (he is 10 years older than I) But now that I am open and "as a matter of fact" like, no one else questions me.. or even expects any less of him.      so have faith.. and relax.  No one after being explained will not be kosher with your situation.

If one of these tablets doesn't work, don't worry, all 3 are slightly different and if one doesn't work, another might.  It is very likely that one of these pills will work.

f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...    Get a diet and fitness calculator that you can put on your computer or cell phone. This will allow you to easily calculate the above formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.     Set realistic goals for your ideal body weight. Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water. Read this article for more information on high GL Carbs:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsou...    Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.     Read a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is Weight Training for Dummies. A superb magazine to buy with resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter. An excellent free online resource is at http://www.exrx.net/    A good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is Fitness for Dummies.     *4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety.     *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues and make a life long commitment to good health. A great free publication is Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. A superb book to read is You The Owners Manual. An excellent periodic publication is the Nutrition Action Health Letter. A reputable test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com    Look at all areas where you can enhance your health. For example, make improvements in the quality of the air you breathe. Review outdoor air quality forecasts where you live and get an indoor air purifier. Send me an email or yahoo instant message to "gainbetterhealth" if you want an indoor air purifier recommendation and if you have any questions.    *Click on all the source links below to get the full benefit of the recommendations. The answers presented to your health questions are not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health providers with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.|`|e35e9f28e808cb8da332ed68485367f4aa	Always check with your doctor before beginning any exercise and nutrition plan.  You need a good combination of aerobic activity and resistance training combined with a healthy diet.  It is not recommended to lose more than 1-3 lbs a week. If you want to lose weight the correct and safe way that will stay off for the long-term, you need a good comprehensive exercise and nutrition plan.    A good program looks like this:    Always warm up and cool down    Muscular Strength & Endurance-you need a good resistance training program that includes exercises for all muscle groups (hips, chest, upper and mid back, legs (quads and hamstrings), shoulders, lower back, upper arms (biceps and triceps), calves, forearms, abdomen, and the gluteus maximus).  Your intensity should be 70-80% 1-RM or 8-12-RM, 8-12 reps, 1 or more sets, 3 times a week for 6 weeks or more when you begin a resistance program. You should begin with 1 exercise for each major muscle group and make sure the days you do resistance training are not consecutive meaning you don't exercise the same muscle group two days in a row. As you continue your program you can add more exercises, add weight, and change up your program to include more days or just work specific muscle groups on specific days. As your muscles grow stronger you will be able to reduce the rest time between each set. You should rest for about 30 seconds between sets.   Muscle is metabolically active and therefore when you gain muscle it burns more calories and helps to raise your metabolism.  If you do not have money for a gym membership or do not have access to one, here is a great website to create a work out plan only using your body weight.  http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/exercise...  You can also search for all kinds of exercises that use weight.  Here is another great website for finding some good exercises for different parts of the body.  http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/St...  Here is a great link to a comprehensive musculoskeletal atlas of the body to help you understand what exactly you are working  http://www.preventdisease.com/home/muscl...  Also, if you are having trouble deciding what type of program you should be doing, here is a website that may help you to better understand the different forms of strength.  http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kelly2.h...          Cardiovascular Endurance-This part is extremely important for fat burning and enhancing your overall cardiovascular performance.  You need to include a warm-up and cool-down.  In order to have an effective cardio plan you must first make sure you remain in your target heart rate zone for at least 30 minutes a day (you can start out doing this for 3 days a week and build up) and then you can build up to 45-60 minutes a day.  This will seriously help to burn fat as well as raise your VO2Max which is basically a number that represents the capacity of your cardiorespiratory system.  The higher the number the more efficient your cardio system is.  You can learn more about VO2 at the following website.  http://www.preventdisease.com/news/artic...  In order to determine your target heart rate, do the following:  know these numbers:  maximum heart rate= (220-age)  resting heart rate=(get this by counting your pulse for a minute when you first wake up in the morning)  heart rate reserve=(maximum heart rate-resting heart rate)  then calculate training intensity:  TI= Heart rate reserve x percentage(use 70%-85%) + resting heart rate  Now your training intensity number is important because this is the number you want to reach for a particular training intensity.  This is the number your heart rate has to get to in order to be in the optimum cardio training zone.  You can perform the TI equation for 70% and then another for 85% to get a good range for your heart rate.  This is your own personal target heart rate zone.  You can either count your pulse yourself or use a heart rate monitor while you are exercising.  You can buy one at most electronic stores.  I recommend the heart rate monitor because you don't have to do anything and it lets you know where you are.    Some even beep when you reach your zone or when you go above it.  Mine has a strap you put on under your clothes and a watch that shows you your heart rate as well as other things.  Now of course, any type of heart rate monitor will not be perfect because there are factors that are not taken into account, but it is one of the most accurate ways to keep track of your heart rate that is easily available to the public.  Here is a website to help you calculate your target heart rate zone  http://www.preventdisease.com/healthtool...  Here is a good website for some information on how to measure your physical activity intensity  http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/physical...  Now, I needed to tell you all of that so I can let you know what cardio activities will fit this type of requirement.    The following are great activities for a good aerobic plan:  cycling, jogging, running, walking, rowing, stair climbing, elliptical machine, aerobic dance, bench step aerobics, hiking, in-line skating, skiing, rope skipping, swimming, and water aerobics.    |`|AA11080485	Try STACK.  It cleanses and nourishes while you lose weight.  You'll lose about a pound a day.|`|f5b5305e9146d752cc5098b3174dac09aa	you have about 7-9 shakes per day in even intervals...youll be friggin starving but you can do it...take a good sugar free fiber supplement and a good multivitamin|`|AA12115848	Exercise. Damn you lazy people w/ you "slim fast" and "milk shakes".       Milk shakes are pretty bomb though...|`|AA11110297	don't put your body through the stress of quick diets  ---if you are athletic you should be pretty toned --- muscle weighs more than fat.Don't believe or do those celeb diets--- most of them look skeletal ---you can be in peak shape by practicing the sport you are good in  and eating healthy ---drink lots of water and get plenty of sleep. I have never heard of anyone competing in sports and doing well if they aren't eating healthy....You drink just Slim Fast only and you'll burn out faster and risk hurting yourself --- check with your doctor first before beginning any diet program|`|AA11352702	It could work, but once you go back to eating your regular diet you will gain most if not all of the weight back.    Count calories and eat healthy. limit sugary snacks and simple carbohydrates.   If you want to weight 135 lbs, eat 1350 calories a day. That will help you lose weight and then maintain it.|`|5b00ac75ad08bbb341ed22e17db40628aa	you will still need some nutrients that slim fast doesn't have. So i would consider consulting a physician and he can tell you what supliments to take as well. But if all your trying to do is lose 10 lbs, try eating light meals and obvisouly exercise.. Jump rope is a great calorie/fat burner as long as you can do it at a fast pace for an incrament of time, id say about 15-25 mins. You will be so tired when you are done you wont be able to eat HAHA.. best of luck tho.. 5'9 145 is pretty good shape tho. I am guessing you are a woman that is. Goodluck with college!|`|00eb66b964d43e0455bbc76ec12ff49faa	just drinking slim fast doesn't lose weight for you, the point of slim fast is to drink it, and it'll give you energy so you can workout. i mean it is a healthy drink, so it's not like you'll gain weight just by drinking that but it gives you energy so excersize so you can lose weight|`|cf54ab7096c857151394859abb0b0952aa	You will NOT be in the best shape for sports if you drink slim fast meal shakes only.  What you need to is to condition your body - lift weights, do cardio, stretch - and eat food high in nurtitional value - lean protein, good fats, fruits, and lots of vegetables.      Beyonce may have done that for two weeks, but here's what happened ... she lost water weight and, most likely, muscle mass (which is something you will definitely need to compete in college sports).    And, by looking at your height and weight, you are pretty much the same size I am.  Which means, if you are very active, most of that 145 lbs is muscle (which weighs more than fat).  Trust me, you will be much better off putting on more muscle before college sports than trying to lose weight with that sort of crazy diet.  You will only regret it later.|`|81de5f2cc8a23bfb59cdf04a25d145abaa	I'm on a high-protein diet and that includes drinking high-protein slim-fast shakes.  I'm on my high-school cross country and Lacrosse team and slim-fast works well with it.  For the slim-fast diet to work, you need to eat healthy, full balanced meals along with it.  Eat a lot of pasta, meats, and vegetables.  Eat foods that have high-protein since you are competitively excercising.  If you are doing sports I highly reccomend NOT eating only slim-fast shakes.  If you only eat slim-fast shakes, then your body will shrivel up because it doesn't have substantiating nutrients and you are relying only on liquids.  There have been many reports where people went on a liquid diet and after a week they passed out.  Do not do that to you body because it is dangerous since you are excercisin, you're body needs all the nutrients it can get inorder to healthily burn those calories.  I already lost 3 pounds in 6 days just by eating high-protein foods and drinking 1 high-protein slim-fast shake a day.      Tip:  Drink your slim-fast 30 minutes before eating lunch and/or dinner.  It will curb your cravings and you'll be able to control your hunger during meal time.

The only thing different is when given the breast milk for nursing , they only have tried and tasted that kind of milk. IF you were to switch to formula, then try to go back to the breast, most babies, will refuse the breast, because formula is sweeter,   which is also why formula is so hard to wean off, to cows milk, the cows milk is less sweeter  then the formula, though most would say formula is disgusting too,|`|181e92a46d146ab8fc28063615bac2d1aa	They don't have any taste buds so it doesn't bother them|`|6c033a54118614b0fd2fabc42b222850aa	breast milk takes on the taste of what the mother eats, and babies have no clues as to what else is out there, as we do. so that is their lifeline and they know after they have it they are full, so they are happy.

Good Luck  http://www.coolnurse.com/masturbation.ht...  It's Normal, Healthy and Okay to Masturbate!     Masturbation can be defined as self-stimulation to cause sexual sensations. The use of the word masturbation usually suggests that the person is manipulating his or her genitals to the point of intense pleasure or orgasm. (Orgasm refers to a period of intense excitement in which genital muscles enter in to a series of highly-pleasurable contractions or movements).   While masturbation can involve another person, most of us think of it as a very private act. According to some health care providers masturbation allows a healthy way to express & explore your sexuality and to release sexual tension without all the associated risks of sexual intercourse. Health professionals generally agree that this private touching is a natural, normal mode of self-exploration and sexual expression. Unfortunately, after the excitement of the moment has passed, many people find themselves filled with guilty and or shame.     Why all this guilt and shame? Actually, from American History.    A little bit of American History:  Our attitudes about masturbation have deep roots for sure. Around the turn-of-the-century, some adults were so against masturbation that they forced their daughters to wear gloves made of a steel-wool-like material (like Brillo pads) at night and to put a powder on their genitals that made them painful to touch. They made their sons wear metal chastity belts at night that made it painful to have an erection. During the 1820s male masturbation was prevented by piecing the foreskin with a wire and soldering the ends together. Boys and girls were discouraged from masturbation by the threat of blindness, madness and illness. Of course, all of these are not true.    Of course, the subject of masturbation was taboo years before the United States was created. All kinds of chastity belts and other devices were used to prevent masturbation, probably as far back in history as you can go. This will vary from culture to culture.|`|AA12267336	its not good once in a while its ok but to often could lead to serious problems like infections and ect.|`|87f92d97414852d3824afbfa1f0df62aaa	only to GOD|`|AA10500597	What exactly is alot, I ask?I have heard that one can burn up to 200 calories per session, So, is 100 times per day excessive?

This sounds dangerous but I go out driving and turn up the music really loud (usually rap hip hop or R&B or an alternative station that has a lot of loud music on)and roll down the windows and drive faster than i should, but it gives me a rush and my adrenaline starts pumping. I also live in California and can drive past the coast fairly quickly, and the sunshine and air are great to get out in. Also, exercise is good, as well as cleaning the house and eating a balanced diet. Getting things done, finishing projects, etc... it is like getting a gold star as a kid.|`|AA12090426	I agree with Ms Fairy Love.|`|9091f8c70823ed3033efebc5a9495c45aa	sure u can. just go and do loo. realy it will help u. my dumb friend|`|be7381ba63e81feadf1379ebebb8e5d6aa	You could try and do something that might take your mind of these thoughts.

Heavy doses of sunlight lightens my mood.  2. melatonin aids depression.  3. this is the craziest but have your girlfriend or even you several times today..  take your finger and move it gently across your eyes as you would hypmotize.  Do this for up to three minutes.  There was a discovery that this would release the same chemical as REM in sleep in your brain... the eye movement.  I do this before a test.  It focuses me.  It works.  Sometimes at first you will not be able to focus on your finger.  Then add touch with a beat.  this is best with your friend tapping on your wrist while the moving finger.  This usually causes immediate relief with the two combined.  4.  Speak out loud and touch things around you and speak their name.  As: Touch the wall and identify it and describe it.  Then move to a table or chair or book.  These are some of the things I do.   5. Avoid tv and computors as you need to still your mind.  6.  Try a hot bath with your friend... hot tub with lavendar oil scent.   These are more gentle than docs.  Also, sing.  the breathing and dicipline of singing can lift your mood.  not rap at this time.  Soothing musicals but you might also do the old favorite....  amazing grace.   Dance...  pattern as in clogging.  puzzles.  the kind you put on the table and piece together or mechanical that you hold however I think the table one is best today.  Animals?  Cats purrs are known to heal bones faster... I don't know about minds and emotions.  good luck.

Try not to eat after 7pm so you body isn't digesting food for energy.  Try to go to bed (and wake up) at the same time every day so your body gets into a routine.  And assuming you don't have any sleep disorders that should do it.

1dcfd1cbe002b5b4354aea9bd5db367eaa	What this means is that you need to see a doctor.  Even with diet and exercise, some people still have high cholesterol, as there are sometimes inherited diseases that influence how your body metabolizes the cholesterol in your bloodstream.  The kidney and liver panel results indicate that something else may be going on, so before your doctor puts you on a cholesterol-lowering drug, he's going to want to run some more tests to rule out other possible diseases.  I do not want to alarm you, as tests are needed to confirm what is going on, but certain people have high cholesterol from problems with their kidneys and/or livers.    Short answer: take those results to your doctor as soon as you can.|`|AA10953985	get more testing... go back to the doctor!!!|`|6f71baa0c1df1b6e4bb4493c4d2915c5aa	ummm   Learn how to spell?|`|80814aaf65ec8170f18aa26d4c804ee8aa	Eat oatmeal everyday for the next 3 months and see the difference...It does miracles...Good luck!

Theraflu isn't even prescription so it doesn't matter. Plus Yaz is a low-dose pill so that means the estrogen doesn't affect you as strongly as some other birth control pills would. Feel better soon!|`|ed23fc8fd4d685b8e8e460ae194f07e5aa	You can take cold meds while on birth control. If you are concerned ask your pharmacist, he will be able to tell you.|`|043fb49c9cb84a23b4abd645432df79aaa	Yes, you can but be carefull.  What a lot of doctors forget to warn you about is antibiotics.  When on birth control and taking antibiotics your birth control may not work as well.  The antibiotics kinda wipe the birth control out of your system.  So be very carefull when you are taking antibiotics because you CAN become pregnant.  My cousin had it happen to her.  She had a son who was ten months old and she was on the birth control pill, she got sick and the doctor prescribed antibiotics and did not warn her.  She then became pregnant and that was when the doctor decided to explain it to her---too little too late.  Most of the other medications out there wont react with your birth control.  If you do have concerns talk with your pharmacist.|`|fe53dcc8e9ff4b8d4153869a09c84c91aa	The things that will keep the pill (especially low dose pills) from working properly are:  Antibiotics  Barbituates (valium etc)  Smoking  Grapefruit  St Johns Wort  Some anti-depressants  Anti-convulsive medication  Laxatives, diuretics and emetics.

All the sites, including the one for Yaz directly, tell you to talk to your doctor before taking anything else.  Despite that, I have been on Ortho Novum for 15 years and have taken aspirin, sudafed, theraflu, etc. whenever I needed it with no adverse affects.  Quite honestly, it never occurred to me to check.  I know that the pamphlet with the prescription usually lists all potential problems.  Also your pharmacy usually puts stickers on the botte.  I am on several prescriptions for allergies and asthma besides the Ortho Novum.  I have one that I am not supposed to take within 2 hours of taking calcium or eating anything with calcium in it.  What a pain!  If you are really nervous, call your local pharmacy.  They should be able to tell you.  If they won't then call your dr. and leave a message.  If you have a good dr.  they should get back to you about this.
48a3M4w8aa	first, this answer only applies if you are overweight.  the darkness under your arms (and in other women, it's on their inner thighs, too) is because your body having a problem with processing insulin.  usually overweight women get this.  scrubbing it, or otherwise messing with it makes it worse.  the only thing you can do is cut down on the carbs in your diet, and after many weeks, the dark color will fade.  look up "hyperinsulinism" on the 'net, and find out more.|`|8beb1393c69b01c3900fd430c1ea0eb8aa	it is justa differnt pigment in the skin no worries nothing wrong with it|`|AA10686104	it sounds like you are insulin resistant, which is a prelude (if you aren't already there) to diabetes. when your body can't handle glucose properly, it comes out in dark patches..usually in crevice areas, or around your neck...this is referred to as bronze diabetes, because in some people it is reddish brown...I had this when I was a kid and was constantly told to go wash my neck again, because it looked like dirt, and when you sweat, it starts coming out like dirt...i really watch my sugar and refined carb (starch, white rice, white bread) intake now, and it isn't a problem...on me, though, if i have too much junk...in twenty four to forty eight hours i have black patches again. don't ignore this, get checked out, because if this is what you have, it can lead to full blown diabetes, which can lead to blindness, amputated feet, and death, but if you manage it, you can avoid all of that and be healthy and normal and maybe never have to take insulin or drugs. good luck

11763093832bbc7c1505ce7dbf883dc3aa	Dry, warm air (indoors) makes excellent conditions for static charges.  You could get a humidifier to increase the humidity.  A great way to un-charge yourself is to touch one of the screw heads on a mains/electrical switch.  I use my elbow to do this, and it does not hurt.  Also, holding a coin or some other metal object when you go to touch something that normally gives you a shock will help protect you from pain (but not people or animals you might be touching).|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	the air is dry. thats all it is, you scuff your feet and dont pick them up enough when you walk. wear rubber soled shoes, look on the label, it must be real rubber.|`|AA11289315	I get that a lot too and I'm not sure why.

Taking two weeks to watch what you eat and eat detox foods can make a wonderful difference anyways.  Lots of folks detox twice a year, and they do well with that.

deA81tFOaa	Es muy difcil para una persona mantener sus ojos abiertos mientras estornuda. El reflejo de cerrar los ojos parece no tener objetivo alguno: los nervios que controlan los ojos y la nariz se encuentran relacionados y un estmulo en uno de ellos a menudo produce una respuesta en el otro. Tambin es casi imposible estornudar sin mover la cabeza, slo si el estornudo es muy suave. Esto es debido a que el movimiento de la cabeza hacia adelante ayuda a expulsar las sustancias irritantes del aparato respiratorio.    Una creencia popular muy extendida es que si estornudramos con los ojos abiertos se nos saldran los ojos. Por supuesto esto es falso, un estornudo no genera la presin intraocular necesaria para que los ojos se salgan. De hecho hay personas que estornudan con los ojos abiertos debido a la prdida de alguno de los reflejos relacionados con los prpados.|`|SEdb3rCTaa	creo que por la presion que ejerce la sangre en los organos del cuerpo en ese momento saludos|`|IQ8wLKMiaa	Porque cuando estornudamos no estamos pensando en eso|`|MDHhsUqVaa	HOLA BUBU!!! pues ya te lo han dicho los anteriores, yo lo nico que puedo a?adir es que si estornudas con los ojos abiertos se te pueden salir o se salen de las rbitas!!  1 bs!|`|ac6b5cc81a742b447736c7f8bf565bf6aa	El estornudo es una reaccin del cuerpo bastante seria...     Por ejemplo, en Estados Unidos, cuando estornudas la gente te dice "Bless You"(Dios te bendiga) porque cuando estornudas, tu corazn se detiene por una   milsima de segundo.      Tambin se dice que si tu estornudas muy fuerte, puedes fracturarte una costilla.     O que si tratas de aguantar el estornudo, puedes romper una vena en tu cabeza o cuello y morir.     Y que es imposible estornudar con los ojos abiertos, y si tratas de mantenerlos abiertos a la fuerza, puedes hacer que se te salgan los ojos.    No lo s, lo que s es que el cuerpo es sabio, y si as lo hace, seguro que tiene sus motivos para hacerlo.    ?No?

Como medida una persona puede perder en forma sana entre 3 y 5 kg al mes. Esto enmarca el tiempo para obtener el peso deseado y luego un tiempo similar para el mantenimiento del resultado conseguido para que tu organismo olvide su vieja situacion y se habite al nuevo peso y al nuevo metabolismo.   Todo esto demuestra que en lugar de ayudarnos a perder peso de forma eficaz las simples dietas o la privacion de alimentos agraban los problemas producidos por las carencias (vitaminas, minerales, aminoacidos esenciales, acidos grasos esenciales, fibras naturales y agua), este desequilibrio nutricional nos conduce a numerosos problemas de salud y de sobrepeso, debido a estas dietas las personas se encuentran en un circulo vicioso del cual no es facil salir.

O56x3M9Laa	Hi there. I think you should try tampons. There are ways to avoid the health risks.....change regularly etc    I am 29 and still use pads because I was scared of tampons as a teen. I wish now that I had just started using them back then.  I guess it's not too late for me to change now, but to be honest I am still kinda scared of tampons. It's totally unjustified though.    Try them, if you don't like them, you can always go back to pads.|`|TORBP6QIaa	I know from experience that if you give the tampons a fair try , that you will never go back to those bulky pads.  Tampons are a bit tricky at first and it does involve touching bits of yourself that you may not be used to doing etc...What you need to do is get a box of slim/lite/mini ones either with or without applicators (I prefer non applicators) and give them a try.    They dont actually hurt but they can tug a little at the skin or feel scratchy a bit from the applicator as you try insert them but lube should help here , menstrual blood is actually the best lube available!...once you have it placed in properly you shouldnt feel a thing and will be able to forget about your period for the next 4 hours or so.|`|KneI3DDRaa	Try the tampons, I personally don't like them very much, it's not that they are uncomfortable, I just have never liked using them unless I am doing something like going swimming, but I do know people who use nothing but tampons, again, try them and see what works best for you.  As for the health risks, there are small chances of something happening, but if you are change them every 6-8 hours(or whatever the instructions may say), you should be just fine.  P.S: The possibility of getting a very bad disease is minimal.  Like I've said before, just try them.|`|ZQVieI5naa	hee hee. i feel the same way! dang i hate pads so much! well, in my opinion, though i haven't tried tampons yet, I'd prefer using tampons. they're safe as long as you put them in right. lolz, i'd go for it. i'll try them with you! haha|`|8I2QmDivaa	Tampons, I used them the first day I got my period. Wear pads when you sleep though. You can't even feel a tampon when it's in you, just remember to change it every 6-8 hours. =)|`|AA10072754	Yes they have their risks but ive always liked them more than pads.    I use the menstrual cup which is...well a cup lol.  It is inserted like a tampon but doesn't absorb (which reduces or eliminates things tampons can cause).  They are also reusable which saves you a ton of time.  And because there is only one, no obvious trips to the bathroom to change stuff.  They can also be left in longer.  They can take time to learn how to use but because they are non absorbent and such they can be inserted before your period (or any time as a matter of fact).  This also means you don't have to wait to leak before you start.    This is the brand I use  http://www.divacup.com/    but there are others like this one   http://www.mooncup.com/    |`|ne6qFRt8aa	tampons are fine as long as you change them every few hours, i know some people who sleep in them i don't i'll use pads at night but if left in for longer than like 6 or 8 hours then they have been known to cause servical cancer and reduce fertilty but no worries if you change them..... i have to pee often so i change them alot but yeah i would say try them... you'll be scared the first time but it doesn't hurt trust me|`|rm5IgsQiaa	Go for the tampons. Trust me.|`|ZbhzyfZ2aa	Tampons are a lot easier to be honest. If you get the kind with the plastic applicator then they don't hurt at all. Make sure that you read all of the directions on how to do it though so it doesn't hurt. Also, don't get a super absorb get regular because those are safer.    Pads are worse because they have leaks and smell nasty.     Make sure to change either tampons or pads ever 4 hours    good luck|`|ieBd6Gxbaa	tampons are so much easier, they only hurt or feel uncomfortable if you put them in wrong, so if they do feel uncomfortable you will know that you put it in wrong, and it may take a few tries to get them in but there are directions on a box so don't worry, you'll be fine  and just switch tampons every 8 hours, or 6 to be safe to stop yourself from getting a TSS   |`|0p5Y7wjaaa	if you prefer a cleaner feeling then sure go for tampons. the health risks that people are talking about is TSS or toxic shock syndrome. its rare...and it only happens if you leave your tampon in too long. i can't use tampons however because i have a really heavy flow...so i end up changing them too frequently. if you insert them right you can't even feel them. the first time i did, it wasn't uncomfortable, but i could tell it was there....eventually you get used to it. just use the directions on the box, start with a smaller brand such as o.b, and talk to your mom, she is probably the best person to help you with this. |`|udCMOnBqaa	I was nervous at first too. But, eventually, after a couple trys maybe, you will get the hang of it. If they are in correctly you wont even know they are there. You can't physically put em in too far. And the health risks...try not to be concerned. Just don't leave em in there for longer than 8 hours! Chances are, you will be changing em way sooner. good luck  1|`|LbxQLFrLaa	Try the tampons. I remember being scared about using them when I was younger. They are much more comfortable than pads and tons less messy. There are directions in the box to show you how to use them. As for the health risks, just change them as directed and you'll be fine. Hope this helps :)
2UDbOpxTaa	Make sure you get a brand that is reduced salt and sugar content. Some brands are 100% peanut which may be your best bet. peanut butter is high in protein and fibre which is good but it's also very high in fat (and sugar and salt if you get the wrong brands) so if you're going to go for 5 heaped teaspoons a day, make sure you monitor your fat intake elsewhere in your eating.    I totally relate to the peanut butter obsession though, I used to have it, to the extent that I would get through two jars a week. Eventually I ate an entire 340g jar in one sitting (disgusting I know) which made me physically sick and now I can't stand peanut butter. So maybe you should try that instead...|`|sGa0dahuaa	well if you want to get fat sure keep on eating.|`|C88VCkvnaa	Maybe try lowering your intake little by little every day. Try finding a healthy alternative that you enjoy, like some kind of favorite fruit or veggie or healthy snack. :) Keep gum on hand, and maybe when you are urging for some, pop a piece of gum in your mouth. Mints can also help with this. =]    GOOD LUCK!!|`|Tq8rwL5laa	peanut butter is pretty fatty, but over all it's not that bad for you. There are alot of things worse.

I'm 15, also in my teens, and my dad is like 50(I don't really even know) hah, but anyways...he is a personal trainer. I agree with the other guy-take in 2000 calories along with a workout. You must do a workout to lose weight as you do a lower calorie diet. If you don't, you are simply going to gain it back when you eat something that is barely over 2000 calories. Which, shouldn't take long to not be able to resist, I'd give you 2 weeks to last. Now, if you work out you are toning your muscles, which is "permanent" compared to gaining it back from just doing a diet. So You should do some crunches, and I say crunches instead of sit ups because, well...they target your ab muscles more, unlike crunches, sit ups works out your back muscles as you elevate higher. A crunch stays lower, targeting JUST your ab muscles and your hips. Hope I've helped, and also be sure to drink plenty of water, it keeps you cleaned out and gets your food out of you faster, so you should be able to lose it faster.|`|NzPfwGJ5aa	For your age, the proper amount of calories you should intake is 2000, and if you want to lose weight you should really try to do some exercise. about 30 minutes per day.|`|bdacd3eb1f35aa91fb0bb65f97a0ae2aaa	Hi. To find out how many calories your body burns on its own every day (say, how many you'd burn if you stayed in bed all day doing nothing) you need to multiply you weight times ten. So say, if you weighed 140 pounds, you'd need to eat 1400 calories every day to maintain that weight. (if you did nothing all day). But since  a 13 year old like you probably moves around a bit more than that, you could add on an extra 400 or so if you wanted to. Or, by not adding anything on you would be loosing weight. Oh, and really what the key to loosing weight is move more eat less. If you eat 1800 calories, but work out and burn 1000 on top of the 1000 or so calories you burn naturally, then you'll loose 15 pounds very, very quickly. So to loose weight safer I would totally go with more exercise rather than less food. Oh, and 3500 calories is a pound so if you burn 1000 more than you eat every day then you'll loose like,  a pound every 3 days. (Also, going vegan is a great and healthy way too boost weight loss!! Look it up)     I hope this helps a tone! and good luck!!

5q5ftpfmaa	For upper body strength, I'd do push ups and sit ups every day. Do pull ups every other day. Lifting weights also helps. Also, for every 30 min of tv/videogames, do 30 of any of the above.           For stamina, run every day. I know it sounds hard, but if you want real stamina, you should run 2-3 miles a day.           This takes lots of time and effort, but it will definetly help you. After 2-3 weeks of this, you should be in perfect shape.  DON'T FORGET TO STRETCH. IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE OTHER STUFF. I HATE STRETCHING TOO.

uttbqGB9aa	Ok Anne, Listen to this because losing weight is not a fad, it's a lifestyle change.    There is NO MAGIC PILL. Pills mostly just dehydrate you, main ingredients are diuretics.    Most work out fads are simply as stated, just fads.    The body is structured simply in weight loss.    Calorie intake, deficit from diet and exercise, and healthy living.    Your body doesn't know what you are doing to lose weight..it only recognizes heart rate to burn calories, and and nutrients from food...calories.     It is pretty simple if you commit to it. Everyone can look decent, it just takes some effort.    1) Cut out all nasty habits (i.e. smoking, junk food, late night snacking, soda)    2) Start drinking a lot of water too keep fully hydrated, I will explain later why, plus its very good for your skin. (Keep a gallon of water handy with you daily)     3) Start a calorie counting log book. Calories = weight.  Record for a couple of weeks EVERYTHING YOU CONSUME.  You will need to do this until you can pratically eyeball how much calories are in your food. Also you will need to know how much daily calories you normally consume to figure out your deficit    4) Figure out a weight loss goal, Example:  If you are 5'5 and 180 pounds and you want want to lose 50 pounds, figure out how much of a calorie deficit you will need.    at about 180 pounds your body needs around 1900 calories to just MAINTAIN its weight. So, you should start out by cutting your calories down to about 1400 and see if you lose about a pound or 2 in a week.    If you do, move on to step five, if not, keep reducing calories until you see some results. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY LOSE UP TO 3 POUNDS IN THE MOST PER WEEK, other than that is not healthy weight loss.    5) Water time, now that you have been drinking a lot of water weigh yourself after the first weigh in before you started drinking the water. The weight loss you see should be mostly fat because you are fully hydrated.    note: most people that lose weight quick, don't realize they are losing mostly water due to poor hydration. When they gain the weight back, they have no idea why.    6) start walking once you gotten all these steps down if you are not used to a lot of activity. BRISK WALK.  After about a week, start alternations with walking/jogging.    7) Eat very clean. If you are a meat eater, stick to poultry. No fried! baked or  grilled. Eat your veggies to fill up. You can eat as much veggies as you want, because those calories burn just from digestion.  Try to stay away from red meats, if you can't, which you can for awhile, only eat 93%  lean beef.    8) COMMIT. To effectively lose weight you must make this routine religious.     If you follow my guide, you will definitely lose weight.    In a couple of months you will see your body completely transform. Our bodies are amazing in what it can do, you will be surprised. We just have to help it out. Our bodies hate what we do to it when we get fat and lazy and have bad habits.    Good luck and you can do it Anne :)    Email me if you need any more advice. Remember this is only a guide I made add and subtract as necessary.|`|07YBD5mJaa	Try the "bender ball"  I ordered on from a TV commercial, but recently discovered Walmart sells them.

You go to the gym.  If you need to lose weight you do cardio-vascular workouts and no weight lifting.  It seems like a lot but it really isn't.  I've lost over 50 pounds in the last 6 months and work out 3 times a week (M/W/F).  I was 230 pounds, and now I'm 175 and am in the best shape of my life.    To lose the weight I changed my diet and began running.  That's all.  Run 3 times a week.  First week walk a mile every day at 3 mph on the treadmill.  Second week walk 3 mph for three minutes, and jog 5 mph for 1 minute.  Do that 4 times.    Third week walk 2 minutes, run 2 minutes.  Do that 4 times.  4th week walk 1 minute, walk 3 minutes.  Do that 4 times (still at the 3 mph and 5 mph paces).  At 1 month you will be able to run a mile at 5.0 mph.  Do a warm up and cool down lap of course (walk a lap before and after you run at 3.0 mph) and make sure you have running shoes or at least tennis shoes on.  Bump 5.0 to 5.1 after a week, and 5.1 to 5.2 after another week.  I'm at 7.2 right now, which is under a 9 minute mile.    Eat healthy.  People are hungry because their bodies need nutrition.  Overweight people eat a lot of the wrong foods, and wonder why they're still hungry.  Yes you might've had a lot of food, but did your body meet it's nutrient requirements?  No.  You will see when you start eating healthy, you will eat a lot less and not be hungry like you used too.      I know some of these people will say diet alone, but that is the wrong answer, and the lazy answer.  The quickest and healthiest way is to diet and run.  I would not have lost all that weight that quickly with diet alone, and I wouldn't be in that good of physical shape.    Good luck to you, it takes a whole different lifestyle and a lot of motivation, but it's not the hard.  If you truely want it you can do it.  Lose the weight with diet and running.  As you step on the scale and see the pounds drop (do it once a week like I was)  the motivation will come.  2 months down the road you'll be surprised how much weight you lost.|`|n3hdlu97aa	the best advice is eat healthy and drink lots of water.I also took the older hyrdoycut and lost 80 lbs with it.you can go to bodybuildin.com or other sites and check it out its the oder one you want.|`|6goQ3VVJaa	IStop asking questions on yahoo answers and step away from the computer now get start running|`|SGCLFbAHaa	well that sucks   but try to only to have meals...no snacks  take alot of jogs and exercise  try to eat enough to carry you trough the day  try low calorie foods  but all in all this will b very hard...try not to give into chocolate even tho it is very good|`|7PR9SQssaa	Well.

Eating healthy and excersizing regularly is the best way to lose weight and be able to keep it off.  By diet I don't mean South Beach, Atkins, Weight Watchers, Nutrisystem, or anything like that. Don't starve yourself or take any of those dangerous pills. Just eat healthy, and don't eat as much as you would like. At all meals just leave yourself a little bit hungry, it is an unsatisfying feeling but it works. Just stop eating a little bit before you would feel full.   And excersize, go for walks when it's nice out, take the stairs instead of the elevator, when your carrying groceries in from the car use the bags as weights and do some curls lol. Just small stuff like that while eating healthy can help a lot, maybe not as fast as you would like it but it's better than nothing.  Hope this helps :)|`|08f801cb12076679501327c507f16f44aa	Seriously!    Stay AWAY from junk food and fast food!!!!  Stay away from ALL soda, one can of pop averages 23 teaspoons of sugar. Just those two things will get results, but even better...    Eat lots of home cooked low fat meals if you can. Lots of chicken, and fruits, and veggies. Lots of water, and if you don't excersise, at least walk. You should be walking a min of 10,000 step a day. Start low like 2,000 steps and work your way up.    Good luck|`|0V4ccF4Xaa	there have 5 factors to think:    i.   Anatomy (body and bone)  ii.  Psychology  iii. Supplements & Food   iv. Exercise (Sport & recreation)  v.

All the best!|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	eat healthy and workout. and do cardio exercizes|`|Fqb5ZJUuaa	Excersize and eat healthy.  Think before you eat and try to chose healthy alternatives.  Start working out.  If you have a tough time running or jogging, just start off walking and build up your pace.  Don't do it for looks though do it to be healthy.  Make sure you do it the healthy way, without crash diets or any other unhealthy eating style.  Chose active alternatives whenever you can also, like walk to class instead of taking a shuttle, take the stairs instead of the elevator.  Once you start getting in shape, you'll love it and won't want to go back to eating poorly and not getting any excersize!|`|9eMB6BZ6aa	Not likely,unless you use first response.

Lets face it if your eating Snikers bars at 8 A.M. your gonna have a weight problem. I dont care how much excercise you do it will be wasted time if you dont eat right. Another thing to keep in mind is to many people get caught up in how much they weigh and lose sight of quality of weight.  If your 5'10" youll still be skinny at 150 lbs. but if your 5'1" total different story. Also remember muscle weighs more than fat so even though you trimmimng inches off your waist line cuz your losing fat and gaining muscle you might actualy gain weight. I have a workout routine that works well for me ill be more than happy to share it with you.

DMpVSHvXaa	"Shut up, stupid brain, you're being irrational. Again."|`|ParFJxnSaa	Instead of anxiety, or worry, downgrade them to "concerns". See section 6, at ezy build, below. "Worry is like a rocking chair - it gives you something to do, but won't get you anywhere." -  Set yourself a specific time period for worrying about anything, (say; around three quarters of an hour, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to even entertain the thought of worrying again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". Doctor Wayne Dwyer once said: "Negative emotions are preceded by negative thoughts". It is important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately.     Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I'm never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even: "I can't do this/will never get over this!", even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that this is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.     Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Alternatively, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Neurofeedback treatment for anxiety is increasingly becoming available.     Herbal remedies, such as valerian, (which is not recommended for use if depression is also present) passionflower, or St.John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect. Imagine, as vividly as you possibly can, that your concerns, anxieties, worries, fears, your self-recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm-too-fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it"are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by. Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past.|`|5eG9uPxWaa	just relax and think about sex!!! trust me it helps,the dirtyier the better then you forget about what stresses you out....|`|DVmDWDC4aa	Well if anxiety is affecting you like this, you should be on some sort of mild medication to control it. I was like you for years, until the doctor put me on a low dose anxiety medication. After a few days I felt human again!  He/she can also give you something for panic attacks - don't be afraid to ask for medication when you need it, people make that mistake too often.    So I control mine with medication :)    Breathing techniqus etc are wonderful, but personally I believe they need to be used in conjunction with medication. You can't get better when you're too anxious to relax!|`|ihdmGsdxaa	I find that working out is a great venting activity. Taking it out on a punching bag really helps me, too. In the times I've done this, I couldn't remember being so relieved.|`|qCoBL6LQaa	Sometimes the best approach is simply to sit down and think your way through your problems. One approach is to work out your thoughts and feelings and about the things that cause you stress and to test your assumptions and beliefs about them, especially where unhelpful or unrealistic. By trying out new ways of reacting you can essentially change your behaviour to something more positive and useful.    This approach does work, and is an effective alternative to medication for many. It's something you can do yourself, and the approach is also used professionally (it's called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) - see the Wikipedia lnik for more). I used a similar approach many years ago to give up smoking, and a simple first step would be to get a DVD such as 'Worry Less & Do More' (link below).    I do hope this helps. Sometimes problems are best solved through thinking and talking - and solved properly - without the need for constant medication.

9ko5WUFkaa	You answered your own question - it had an ingrown hair in it.  So there you go, put your mind at rest, it was an ingrown hair.  They happen to us all - where ever you have hair it can become ingrown.      I really want to tell you to make sure you use protection when you have sex but you surely know that.  So I'm not going to lecture you - just please use some common sense and then you won't have to worry whenever you have something as simple as an ingrown hair that it might be an STD.    Though, you still might have an STD, but your ingrown hair is not a symptom.  If you've had unprotected sex there are a few things you might have caught that don't have any symptoms, such as chlamydia or HPV.  At 17 you're more than old enough to go to the doctor on your own, without your parents having to know.  Find a different doctor to your family one if that  makes you more comfortable.

fk9AvB25aa	Oral herpes and genital herpes come from the same virus they are slightly different strains of herpes.  If she has genital herpes and has sex with you when she has signs of an out break THEN you could possibly get genital herpes from her. When she doesn't have an out break there is LESS of a chance but still a small possibility that she could pass genital herpes onto you. Your chances of getting herpes are even further reduced if she is on some kind of suppressive therapy.   If you give her oral sex while she has an out break then you could possibly have genital herpes passed to your mouth. But she would have to have an out break in order for that to happen. Genital herpes likes to "live" on the genitals but it can be passed to the mouth.  If she doesn't have cold sores then she does not have oral herpes, then you wouldn't get oral herpes from her. If she had oral herpes she could pass them to you genitals if she gave you oral sex while she has a cold sore.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	oral and genital herpes are completely different viruses, no you wont get herpes from her.

x5tAxZR8aa	Performance anxiety or fear of performance is a common sexual problem in which anxiety about engaging in sexual activity becomes an overriding block to the spontaneous flow of sexual feelings and thoughts. The fear of sexual performance, or more accurately the fear of not performing sexually, can affect sexuality in a variety of ways.  Performance anxiety can result in avoidance of sexual encounters, lowered self-esteem, relationship discord and sexual dysfunction. Typically, an awareness of performance anxiety produces so much preoccupation with the anxiety itself that the person becomes less fully involved in the sexual interaction, bringing about the very failure that is feared.

Performance anxiety can result in avoidance of sexual encounters, lowered self-esteem, relationship discord and sexual dysfunction. Typically, an awareness of performance anxiety produces so much preoccupation with the anxiety itself that the person becomes less fully involved in the sexual interaction, bringing about the very failure that is feared. In one common scenario, as the anxious partner worries about how to be sexually responsive and spontaneous; he or she focuses on each detail of the lovemaking. One partner may focus on how rapidly the other partner is breathing, whether a shift in position is required, or how much lubrication or erection is present. The sexual interaction is dissected so deliberately that enjoyment is virtually impossible. Sexual encounters that proceed in this fashion have a high probability of being unfulfilling for one or both partners.    Anticipation of the next sexual encounter arouses the same anxiety coupled with the memory of the previous failure and often leads to avoidance of sexual activity altogether, or at least to minimizing the amount of sexual interaction that occurs. This may result in one member of a couple mistakenly interpreting the situation as a form of rejection. The underlying avoidance, however, is usually not to reject one's partner, but to save face in a way that helps the person feel more in control and less guilty about being inadequate.    Erectile dysfunction, is a disorder that can develop as an outgrowth of performance anxiety. Isolated episodes of not getting an erection or of losing an erection at an inopportune time are so common that they are almost a universal occurrence among men. Such isolated episodes do not mean that a man has a sexual dysfunction. They may occur as a result of a temporary physical stress (having a cold, being tired, having consumed a large meal or too much alcohol), or may relate to other problems like tension, lack of privacy, or nervousness about a new partner. If the man does not take such incidents in stride and becomes upset by his failure to respond physically, he may set the stage for difficulties in future sexual experiences by worrying about his ability to perform.|`|zDf186Xyaa	If your streesed mate, then you wont get  a hard-on. You need to get out of that strees-zone, try taking sports, activities, swimming, sped time with family, do anything which keeps you away from stress. Or take the stress out on the woman, try blue-pills, geinsing, herbal tablets.|`|945gMsSZaa	If the stress levels you have been experiencing have brought you to the brink of a breakdown then a loss of sexual function is not only normal but to be expected.    It is just a symptom.  Treat the cause of your stress and the situation will right itself without outside intervention.  Difficult though it is, worrying about the problem will just make it worse.  You can always rely on viagra as a temporary solution but I would do what you can to relax and improve your mental health first.|`|5589fbd695adfa2721fe85c5288a8fb9aa	i would really go and see your doctor, stress can cause a lot of emotional problems which in turn could be effecting your ability to get and maintain an errection, your doctor should be able to help you with some of these issues!|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	You def need to chill out more and look after yourself, I'm sure as soon as you do all will go back to normal.

You need to get your exercise, eat right and get enough sleep to help you cope.  We all face stress and you can face it too.  You will do much better if you personally feel better but eating comfort foods that injure you and not getting enough exercise and or sleep will drain your ability to deal with stress properly.      Now you know what to do you can start handling stress much better.  I'm praying God will help you to help yourself.|`|43c12469e8d0d209a35b48c2d7f58b8eaa	I have had the same problem. Let me tell you this; healthy body, healthy mind. If you're willing to take on some intense exercise and a pretty healthy diet to get your body to its best, then your body will cope with things better, including stress, and your penis problems will most probably improve. I had these kind of problems myself and I'm much younger than you... I basically had bad anxiety and stress, and bad circulation, so I got into exercising a lot and a good diet to restore my body. It helped my mind as well as my body. I am now fitter than before by a long shot, and I find it easier to relax and cope with day to day life because I made my body stronger, and that includes the brain.     Even though your E.D sounds psychological, a healthy living is going to help a lot. It feels like it can be extra stress at first but it's not the case once you get into such a routine. Keep in mind that anything good for your heart is good for your blood flow, which is good for getting errections. Certain supplements will help toward this as well as exercising daily (or at least most days). Be patient though, it can take weeks or more to notice any big improvements, but it's worth it of course. You can get more detailed advice from your GP in relation to this.     First things first though, lay off some of the things that are stressing you out. If it's work, lessen the hours, it's not worth destroying yourself for. A note from your GP will get your boss to agree to this. It may even be worth getting time off so you can get yourself into shape and relax. You are entitled to this when suffering from such problems. If it's children, get some extra help. etc. I hope this helps. Please see your GP asap.|`|5cDVQED5aa	get urself to a dr !!!

Doesn't even have to be a noticeable blow to the body for there to be a bruise. However, this can be cured in time with iron supplements prescribed by a doctor, all you have to do is go to your GP and he/she will probably sort you out with a blood test to see if you have anaemia.     As for the bumps and itching, it sounds like you might be having an allergic reaction to something. I can't tell you if these symptoms are hand in hand with the bruises or not, I can't think of a single underlying cause for all of them. Could easily be these 2 separate problems.     Go to your GP asap and express your concerns and what you suspect, and then you can get to the bottom of the problem(s). Just do yourself a favour and don't worry too much.

3BB8Gn0taa	these are just a few things I have tried over the years for my cold sores.  Toothpaste overnight, seems to work well.  Placing icecube in hanky on to coldsore, works well in early stages.  Metholated spirits or nail polish remover, dabbed with cotton wool.|`|Q8fcepcZaa	if you have any aftershave or deodorant, that works just as well as any cream for me, it'll sting for a few seconds but that's how you know its working.|`|1Gm5xXE0aa	You poor thing.  I doubt shampoo will make it better even if it's tee tree oil because it will be mostly soap with a tiny bit of tee tree oil, if any.  Plus there will be all sorts of other chemicals.    You 're not supposed to mess about with cold sores really - as I'm sure you know - but what about a bit of salt water?    I also found a link with home remedies for cold sores - use with caution!|`|VQuo1AKhaa	what i do that works the best is putting one ice cube on the cold sore and it help lots and it doesn't like the cold and it stops it from growing the ice feels sooo good on the sore when it burning and itching there you go that all i do it's works good for me ,, your welcome

ALL diets have a 95% failure rate within five years.    So realistically, if you are looking at "dieting" to lose weight, neither is actually effective at all. Now in terms of just general nutrition one could make arguments for both and against both. As long as your diet is well rounded you will be doing well.     If you are planning to lose weight, just eat a well balanced diet and exercise. It's not complicated and doesn't require a gimmick.

If you go at it for too long without ejaculating, this can be painful on the testicles. A lot of guys stop before they ejaculate so that they can continue on and have an improved orgasm once they let themselves ejaculate, but doing this too much will cause blueballs. It is a horrible cramp, as you know. So if you're doing what I just described, cut down on it or don't do it at all.|`|SOlxlhKHaa	its okay but the imp.is to have good times wz yo penis :d|`|BMYOukx5aa	This feeling after masturbation is common in a lot of men.

5oNwMqMiaa	I wouldn't bother - if you're looking for a quick fix diet honey, you won't find it!  The only way to lose weight sensibly and healthily so it stays off is to eat a balanced diet and exercise.  Your Mum may disapprove of these pills because of your age, the ingredients and she probably knows they won't work....she's probably been there at your age.  Good luck with getting active instead :-)|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|E2kx5kwjaa	She really has your interest at heart when she forbids you on such diet.    Slimming pills and teas do not help to lose weight effectively in the long term. The use of slimming products may lead to rapid weight loss initially. By and large, many slimming products contain substances that suppress the appetite, stimulate metabolism or induce drastic water loss from the body.    It is not safe to use these products without adequate medical supervision. Moreover, slimming products are usually expensive and do not help change the overweight individual eating and exercise habits, which are the root causes of weight gain. This makes the maintenance of weight loss difficult.|`|RUYPVTdkaa	how old are you?  why would she say no?  If you have a debit card just buy them online.

Why wouldnt your mom want to buy you green tea diet pills.....pillss arent good for your body....just drink green tea!!!  its good...i think............ :)|`|ZsCqfPaZaa	I wouldn't bother with the pills.  Just start actually drinking the tea instead.  You'll be consuming a great amount of fluid -- excellent for metabolism -- and you can't really take the benefits of green tea and encapsulate it with sawdust.    Those pills are bollocks, anyway.  Be sure to note the warning label on the commercials:  "These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA."  That's legalese for, "We made all the crap up, but please buy our junk anyway."

gMzGP7KWaa	Swelling is just a symptom that goes along with this procedure, It will go away in time on its own when your gums have healed. If it is annoying then ice will reduce it somewhat, apply ice on for 20 minutes and off for 30. Never leave ice on an area, due to frostbite. Good luck. Hope you feel better soon.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	Nope, it's called time.  You have done what you can.  I'll be honest with you, it took a week for mine to not be noticeable (I had all 4 done at once), and 2 weeks before I noticed myself back too normal.    Edited to add: it is too late now for ice to work - it works best while the bruising is fresh - once it is this old, you just have to let it heal in its own time.|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	Heres how to heal wisdom teeth by step    Step 1:Chomp down on the gauze packing placed in your mouth during your wisdom teeth extraction. In fact, this gauze should stay in your mouth for about an hour. Then, replace it with another packing of gauze. Keep the area packed for about 8 hours.     Step2:Refrain from brushing your teeth for the first 24 hours. This could prevent the blood from clotting properly. The blood clot created from wisdom teeth extraction eventually turns into bone and gum tissue, so this clot is very important.     Step3:Place a tea bag over the clot 24 hours after your wisdom teeth extraction if it still oozes a small amount of blood. This will help to restrict the blood vessels and stop the bleeding.     Step 4:Place 1/2 teaspoon salt into a cup of warm water and swish it around the surgical sight 24 hours after wisdom teeth extraction. This will help easy pain and speed up healing. Do not, however, spit out the water, simply let it drip out of your mouth over the sink.     Step 5:Use tylenol or any type of prescribed medication from your oral surgeon after your wisdom teeth extraction. You can also you hot and cold compresses on the outside of your jaw. This actually does quite a bit for the pain.

OeCUOTwiaa	One of the most common additives to deodorant (and what deodorant is mostly made up of) is propylene glycol. Basically this keeps the deodorant, if it is a stick, from drying out. However, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, propylene glycol is a suspected neurotoxin, which can cause throat and lung irritation, cysts, enlarged sweat glands, and dermatitis. <br>  <br>  Most common antiperspirants contain aluminum salts, most commonly in the form of Aluminum Chlorohydrate (Certain Dri contains Aluminum Chloride). While aluminum salts help keep you dry, the effects of being exposed to aluminum have been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. <br>  <br>  "'Aluminum is a highly toxic substance in your brain,' warns Theo Kruck, Ph.D., associate professor of physiology at the University of Toronto. Kruck, who has participated in several studies investigating aluminum's impact on health, believes 'antiperspirants pose unnecessary exposure to aluminum.'"<br>  <br>  Another ingredient commonly found in deodorants is Talc. According to the National Toxicology Program, "cosmetic-grade Talc has been shown to be a carcinogen." <br>  <br>  "Prolonged inhalation of talc can cause inflammation of the lungs, bronchial irritation and the development of fibrous lesions. To reduce these risks, avoid aerosol antiperspirant sprays: The fine mist they produce contains not only talc and aluminum particles but petrochemical propellants that are easily inhaled."<br>  <br>  Another problem with deodorants is that they most commonly contain synthetic fragrances.  <br>  <br>  "One of the leading triggers of sensitization and irritation, man-made fragrances often contain methylene chloride, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone and even formaldehyde, all of which are considered hazardous chemicals. For users, the result can be contact dermatitis, as well as neurotoxicity, respiratory sensitivity and problems involving the immune system. You can avoid these imitation scents by choosing products labeled 'fragrance-free.'"<br>  <br>  People have only been wearing this junk since the late 40's and early 50's for the most part. I think that it is mostly another unnecessary product we consume.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	As a general rule - antiperspirants cause the pores to swell to keep you from perspiring.  When you perspire, that is the body's natural air conditiiong system.  It helps to remove toxins from your body when the pores are open.  If the pores are swollen shut, the toxins can back up into one's system & cause lumps & other problems.   The toxins must go someplace.  However, if you use a good quality deodorant - that helps combat odor & does not make the pores swell, I would think you would be better off.  I have stressed this fact to my entire family for years.|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	I think you're thinking of antiperspirants.  Yes, they do contain aluminium chloride, which is dangerous if you're a breast cancer patient.  If you're not already suffering from breast cancer then you're not at risk from developing it through use of antiperspirant.<br>  <br>  Aluminium chloride stimulates the growth of already present breast cancer cells in the same way that estrogen does but it does not cause healthy cells to become cancerous.  Even then, the effect is 500-1000 times less than if you are taking estrogen orally or are obese.<br>  <br>  There are rumours that it causes Alzheimer's but there is no evidence to support this and it is based purely on the fact that Alzheimer sufferers bare aluminium deposits in their brain lesions.

At best they may give temporary penis enlargement but it soon fades back to the previous size.<br>  <br>  There is also a risk that you could burst capillaries, get blisters or even worse, develop improper circulation leading to a host of other problems, and even possible impotence.<br>  <br>  A method that does work to enlarge your penis is doing penis enlargement exercises. If you do these properly, you really can add extra length and girth to your penis, and they are totally safe.

Try going dairy-free for about one week and see if this helps. If you are a real fan of milk and dairy products, you may find relief in this. If this does not help, then try wheat-free. If that does not help, try an elimination diet, which means eating only simple foods like rice, chicken, leafy green vegetables and clear liquids. If you find the gas subsides, then you can slowly introduce foods, one at a time into your diet. You would really need to do this by a controlled plan, so look Elimination Diet up, online or through a book at the bookstore. Sounds like a food sensitivity. Also you might add yogurt to your diet after you determine what foods are causing this. If none of that helps, go to the doctor to see if there is something else going on.|`|qZ9JeED7aa	Try ginger.

Three filling and nutritious meals a day and no processed snacks in between those three meals.<br>  Fruit and vegetables are an ideal and appropriate alternative to snack on between meals.<br>  <br>  If you happen to work or do business locally, then opt not to drive to the shops etc. Rather leave sufficiently earlier and walk the distance (there and back). <br>  <br>  At the end of the day (or in the early morning at the start of the day), go for an hour long walk every day. Once your fitness levels are adequate enough, you may choose to start jogging. In which case, you could do your walk in the early morning and the jog at night :)<br>  <br>  The main secret is to eat nutritiously, cut out processed snack foods and essentially be incorporating exercise at every available opportunity. E.g. walking everywhere, taking a walk at lunch time, walking to your child's school to pick them up if applicable. It is also an obvious case of burning more energy through exercise as opposed to your daily energy intake (eating).<br>  <br>  I really hope that the suggestions that I have provided will really benefit you. Alot of the suggestions are just common sense. I have used such methods successfully in the past. Maybe i should practice what i preach and get back into it again. I seem to have packed a few kilos on over the festive season and into the new year.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|k1AZtmM1aa	first,eat slower.Wait till the food is mush in your mouth till u eat it,and don't get a big amount on your fork.<br>  When u are used to that,get smaller portions and subtract something unhealthy that u don't mind subtracting.Gradually do more and more of this.<br>  Don't think u have to do big,stressful exercises.Just walk about 20 minutes one part of the day and 20 minutes later that day.Then gradually walk longer.<br>  Losing weight takes time,don't rush in cuz u won't be able to stick with it.<br>  A tip would be to drink alot of water.don't drink something else when you're thirsty cuz your body is realy craving water.Like in the morning when u wake up thirsty,don't just drink juice or coffee,drink some water.Water is very good for your skin and hair and makes your skin shine healthily.If u don't drink water,then your eyes will get dark and your skin tones will pale out and be uneven.<br>  It also really helps to look at the benefits that healthy food can give you.There was one time for a couple of days I had been eating alot of fruit and I had so much energy,but when i started eating unhealthy food,I was cranky and sluggish.<br>  There is nothing wrong with enjoying unhealthy food like cheesecake hamburgers,just eat a small amount of it on occasions.<br>  Again,losing weight takes time and u won't be able to make a big change all at once,unless you have a strong will power haha|`|nZmLycrXaa	Diet & exercise.

VHDXQhY6aa	ok, actually, i think you're going about this all wrong.  300 calories a day sends your body into what is called survival mode.  it means all of those 300 stay in and nothing comes out because you need those calories.  there's a 1000 a day calorie recommendationn for a reason sweetie, and it's not to keep you fat.  running and playing games is good, but your body is probably used to it by now and burning more efficient.  let me also say that no one 5'6 and 130 is fat.  you might not be as skinny as you want, but you are not fat.  you might want to lose a few inches, or tone up, but you aren't fat.  i'm 5'3 and 120, and while i might look fat to me it's within healthy, so i'm looking to tone up, and a couple pounds wouldn't be bad, but i'm not fat.  i was 130 but through hard work and good eating i changed that.  the way i changed that was i got a couple cookbooks with healthy recipes in them (not unreasonable ones, but ones with a balanced meal, like a salad with noodles, veggies, and meat for example) and i started trying new recipes.  i made sure each recipe looked fairly balanced, and i didn't count the calories, however, if it included something like soy sauce, which is high in sodium, i used 1/2 to 1/4 as much.  look to shape magazine and and SOMETIMES muscle and fitness, the new women's muscle and fitness is great, but the men's works, as long as you learn how to alter it.  i'm not gonna lie, some of this costs some money, like if you pick up a yoga dvd, you need a mat too, but exercise dvds work great.  if you explain to your parents (i'm assuming you're not on your own) a lot of times if you explain that you want to be toned and healthier (not you're fat and want to lose weight, though part of healthier can be to lose weight) they'll be willing to help you shop around and make healthy choices.  you're welcome to email me if you need some help designing workouts, it's kinda what i do and i'm always willing to help someone willing to do it the right way.  good luck :)|`|grld3mC0aa	You probably don't want to hear this but... you are not fat. If you look at a chart and enter your height and weight, you will see that your weigh is right on for your height.<br>  Also your not eating enough for the amount of activity your doing everyday. Your body will quit losing weight because your not giving it what it needs, it thinks your starving and doesn't burn anything<br>  Now if you want to tone your muscle and get defination, start doing weight lifting. But PLEASE.... start eating more, even if it's fruits, veggies and protein. Your body will thank you!|`|ZGE6gh6baa	Ash--Dude, seriously... start eating. Those 300 calories you are eating is actually really pissing your body off. The foods you eat is what your body uses as fuel so you can exercise. And later on when you try to eat more your body is going to hoard extra calories because it won't know when it will get it again.<br>  Try toning exercises to tighten some spots that "make you look fat"<br>  Aerobics is great for simple toning.|`|DWwv3v9Raa	300 is not nearly enough calories to consume daily, this is very unhealthy. Increase your calorie intake and your body will respond to it in a healthier way.

Also, when you lose weight the legs and hips are always the last spots to go, the arms and around the rib cage and the face are always first.

Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.<br>  <br>  Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.<br>  <br>  Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina.

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Sounds as if you have a yeast infection.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	It's a normal part of being a woman. It's just a discharge. We all get it. You don't need to buy a douche. It's probably because you're getting close to starting your period again. Even though you said you already had your period this month, it is possible to have 2 periods in one month because they generally are 24 days or so apart. So you could have one period at the beginning of the month and another at the end of the month. Anyhow, I think you're fine. If it begins to itch, smell bad, or turn white and thick, then you need to go see the doctor because it's probably an infection. Just wash yourself well, clean well after going to the bathroom, and wear cotton underwear because it's breathable. Take care!|`|TBbhmZEwaa	its not serious i dont think.|`|04F4149yaa	It's completely normal. This stuff is called discharge. Did you get your period yet? This is a sign that it's going to come within the next 5 months or so.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, it will be with you forever pretty much. Just put on panty liners if it gets to be too much.

It could be a yeast infection. The only way to find out for sure is to have a doctor check it out, or you could go to Web MD and type in your symptoms!|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	If it's clear, it's normal.

I would go to the doctor, and ask, they will do a test, and figure out exactly what it is, and perscribe an antibiotic, or something else for you.  Otherwise, I would suggest allowing it to air out as much as possible, keeping your vagina closed from the air will lead to infections much more quickly than if it can breath.

KY9VGuLLaa	That depends -- what are your goals?  Are you trying to gain weight?  Put on muscle?  Either way, it doesn't sound like your diet is very balanced. Do you eat anything with protein in it?  You should be eating protein, carbs, and fat at every meal.  There's nothing wrong with eating more carbs on days that you have a hard workout, but you shouldn't cut out a food group entirely.  Your body needs carbs to function!|`|OvZPHDgdaa	Actually, you don't have to diet in fact to lose weight, the only diet which clearly showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I shed 30 pounds, it clearly does produce results!|`|WwrCYF1kaa	If your weight is ok just eat a well balanced diet.<br>  <br>  If you are chilling on these days and want to drink a pint or two of beer (make sure it's a good quality real ale or bitter not cheap low alcohol lager) then don't eat carbs. <br>  <br>  I do the latter as I am not a serious body builder and my weekends are for fun and I like to have a pint.<br>  <br>  I hope that you are eating enough protein, you don't mention this but I guess you kinda know what your doing.<br>  <br>  Remember that you are still burning carbs on your rest days and during your sleep. Your muscles are also recovering and you need to replace glycogen so you still need to eat well, this includes carbs. You do not need to eat the same amount of calories. You do not have to eat brown bread, oatmeal or brown rice if you want a little variety. You will also need to ensure that you are getting the right vitamins and minerals. Your brain is still functioning on these days and still needs to be fed. <br>  <br>  Wonder why brains don't take a day off?

My boyfriend has just recently lost about 60 pounds in about 6 months, but the 6 months include lossing 60 pounds and gaining mucsle like crazy and cutting his body fat % down to like 3%! He really lost the weight in about 2 to 3 months. I can tell you what he has done and what he eats. He first started off by this info commerical workout video we saw on tv. I know it sounds dumb but it acually worked! It was called p90x Look it up its really good, but he stayed on that for about a totally of 3 months every day for an hour doing something different everyday. Now he goes to the gym everyday of the week except for Sunday. The things that he has been eating: for breakfast he has oatmeal, for lunch just really anything light and not to heavy, and for dinner he has plain grilled chicken with rice or beans or something like that. oh and lots of water!!

During this type of craving I'm usually quite irritable, nervous, tense and all I can really think about is having a cigarette. In extreme cases I will fidget and my hands will start shaking. I also cannot eat or drink anything during this type of craving. However, once I light a cigarette and take a nice deep drag everything begins to calm down. My body relaxes as the nicotine makes its way through my bloodstream and into my brain. If I smoke that first one too fast I do feel a slight light-headed, but only if its been several hours since my last smoke.<br>  <br>  A psychological craving can be triggered by any number of things that I associate with smoking a cigarette. Driving, drinking coffee or alcohol, being around other smokers or simply just relaxing at|`|dKFeVU72aa	Are people really addicted?

a9BYPzKxaa	I've heard that as well but there's no actual evidence backing that up right now.  They say that if you're drinking sodas, you're probably not drinking the milk you need which has calcium, which is great for your bones.  Also, sodas have so much sugar in them...it's outrageous the amounts if you were to figure it out.  Stick to water, that's the best for you and milk.  You should be drinking 2-3 litres of water daily, and I know that sounds like a lot.  When I started drinking all that water, I found it was easier if I got myself a 1 litre bottle and kept track that way....having that bottle meant I only had to drink 2 or 3 of them full which made it easier for me.  Hope this helps.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It's the combination of caffeine and sugar that can cause this.<br>  <br>  Plus that stuff rots your insides anyway.|`|JJa1DJSraa	put soda in a glass then put a penny in there. in a month you will see.
N9nJWYa5aa	If you recon you are already in reasonably good shape, then lack of tone might suggest that you are still carrying too much body fat.  I'm not talking about going down to the extremes, but you should start getting serious tone at around 10% or less.  That's only a rough estimate, and probably isn't low enough to get your abs looking ripped.
DScRAWrPaa	Sounds like Pica.  Pica is the term used to describe a person's craving for non-food items.  This is most commonly caused by nutritional deficiencies (such as iron or zinc deficiencies) or lead toxicity. You should see your doctor to get lab work done so the causes can be treated.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I misread.  Thought you said you like crunching on ICE not rice...........|`|AA11046205	Sounds like you already know the answer, but if you need some reinforcement, then here goes. It can harm your teeth just as biting on jaw breakers. It also leaves residue between your teeth that increases tooth decay. That residue made up of starch breaks down into sugar, which brings us back to the hhemoglobin you mentioned. Your hemoglobin(blood sugar levels) will increase, but probably not very significantly, unless you are really packin away a lot of rice. Probably better for you than chewing on pencils coated in lead paint.|`|0k9WaGm5aa	It sounds kinda bad, but I bet its okay.

vLcOoy5paa	Let me just start by saying, I do not miss Loestrin 24 Fe AT ALL.  That pill made me feel like I was going crazy.  I too experienced horrible crying spells, horrific cramps, missing periods (I guess that is very normal), tenderness that lasted the entire month as opposed to the week before, and an absolute monster the week before and of my period.  After 18 months I had to throw in the towel and go off of it. I had been taking another bc pill for 4 years before I switched to Loestrin 24 Fe, and I had never had any of those symptoms before! <br>  <br>  When I spoke to my doctor about it, she said it was strange that I was so sensitive to this BC but it happens.  I went back on Ortho Tric Cyclen and have since returned to normal.  While I miss the light periods, being a nut case half of the month was draining.<br>  <br>  You really should speak with your doctor, but if you can live with the side effects then it isn't a big deal.  There are medical sites where women can share their experiences about being on Loestrin 24 Fe.  I would recommend reviewing the boards to see if others have the hot flashes.<br>  <br>  I have attached a link to one of the boards, but there are many more out there.

70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	In order to get that "cut" appearance you have to "Eat Clean". That means you have to stay away from processed foods and fast foods; eat a diet high in protein, low in fat,  high complex carbohydrates and low in sodium; drink at least 2 liters of water but no more than a gallon a day; take a multivitamin and glutamate supplement. Oatmeal or porridge and eggs are going to be your staple so stock up on those items.<br>  <br>  As far as exercise, you would want to lift more weights than do cardio. I thought that doing a lot of running or cardiovascular exercises and little weight lifting would help me lose weight and fat but it didn't do anything. When I changed my exercise routine, I focused more on weight lifting and resistance training with few days of cardio and saw results immediately. In a typical week I try to lift weights or do resistance training 3-4 days a week and do cardio 2 days a week. Try to increase your weight load or reps every 2 weeks since the body easily gets use to a particular routine. Never lift weights back to back; always give your body at least 48 hours to recuperate. My schedule is as follows: Monday, Wednesday, Friday I lift weights and do resistance exercises (lunges, squats, push-ups, sit-ups, crunches, etc) 60 mins each day. Tueday and Thursday I run on treadmill or elliptical machine 45-60 mins; you can take an aerobics class or bike as another option for cardio. Saturdays if I feel up to it I might do a class or run for 30-45 mins and do weights another 30-45 mins.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Jog 30-45 minutes non-stop five days a week. That's what I did.|`|ab9d0d9ad5f495e6629d6147a4ea8894aa	The above answer is correct about a lot of things.  Adding to that, your cardio should be in interval training for cut fat.  Whether it's running, the elliptical, biking, etc. you should practice interval training (sprinting for 30-60 seconds with a rest period, then repeat).  You cannot "spot reduce" fat and any fat showing on your body is a reflection of your total body fat.  Your best bet is a total body weight lifting routine and interval training for cutting this fat.  Hope this helps :)

Drink lots of fluids as well. Sometimes we don't get enough water.<br>  <br>  As for what should you do ... Call your family doctor or gasterenterologist. Fissures are prone to becoming chronic. And I do mean chronic. The only way to deal with a lot of them is to have surgery to close them up, after which, for two weeks, you'll be eating lots of soup and in a little pain, but it's well worth it.<br>  <br>  Everyone that I have known to have  a fissure eventually had to have surgery to repair it properly, otherwise, it kept tearing.<br>  <br>  For the future, get plenty of fiber in your diet to eliminate hard stools. Stools should nice and soft, and require no pushing from you. Sprinkle a little flaxseed meal on your oatmeal, in cereal or other foods like yogurt in the morning. That will help a lot. Make sure to keep flaxseed in the fridge or it becomes rancid.<br>  <br>  Also, the gasteroenterologist might want to do a sigmoidoscopy to take a look-see.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|rxScdXM4aa	call you doctor and follow their instructions. you could risk and inffection|`|l7GjBVvhaa	You need to take a mirror and check yourself out and see if you can notice anything.

If if is something that she really wants to do that is her decision and you should love her regardless.<br>  <br>  However, breast implants can be really gross and I have seen some really BAD jobs.  I would keep trying to convince her not to get it done.  Tell her how perfect they are and that you think it is something she should reconsider.<br>  <br>  If she refuses to change her mind, help her find a really good doctor so that it turns out good.  And convince her not to get more than a C cup...she will probably look ridiculous going from a B cup to a D cup.|`|rxScdXM4aa	keep insisting that she looks fine and then support her in her decision. but first have a serious talk and let her know how you feel. go over the pros and cons with her seriously.|`|UZSvbJTXaa	well i totally think your one of the best boyfriends ever telling her shes beautiful. i am surprised that didn't stop her from getting the surgery. but if she does get the implants support her every step of the way. it should be easy to do this if you seriously love her for her personality. your girl friend is obviously worried about her boobs so even if she does or doesn't get the surgery don't make any rude comments about her boobs its like calling a anorexic person fat.|`|gBH2n7Gyaa	first off if you two been together for 2years then why would you leave her if she did get bigger breasts thats stupid... you should be happy she is probably trying to please you
y7lUgd3aaa	First off Ill just say that I got all my information from the site below.  It says that your doctor will put you on a special diet before the surgery and possibly administer an enema.  I have not had this done.  Pain and discomfort are common following hemorrhoid surgery and pain-relief medications are usually prescribed.

I got my period when I was 14 and I remember my mom saying that if i didn't get it soon she was going to take me to the doctor.  Did other females in the family start their cycles late?  If so its probably not something to worry about, but if she is 15 or 16 and still doesn't get it I would be worried because there maybe be a problem with cysts or something.|`|cDqLCZyzaa	well based on years of emptying trash cans in the girls bathroom i would have to say yes. i started bleeding out of my penis at the age of 56 but thats cause i have aids.|`|AA10958492	It all depends on the woman and her body.

Wz9tSKTaaa	If you're asking what types your child could be, they are (in decresing order of probability):<br>  A+, O+, A-, O-<br>  <br>  Blood type is controlled by a 2 alleles per person, 1 inherited from each parent, out of 3 kinds: A, B and O. A and B alleles are dominant to O (whilst codominant with each other - hence AB blood). What that means is that if someone has 1 A allele and 1 O allele they will be type A (but still have the O, which they may potentially pass on to their children). O types therefore must have 2 O alleles. If your husband is genetically AA (the genes aren't generally tested for), any children you have with him will be A. If he is AO, there is a 50% of a child being O type (because it's paired his O with 1 of yours).<br>  <br>  As for the +/- (Rhesus D), that is also due to 2 alleles, with + being dominant to -. So someone with 1 of each will be a positive type just as if they had 2+s. If both of you have 1 of each (which wouldn't be that surprising) it's possible for you to have negative children. (By comparison, 2 negative types having a positive type is usually a bit suspicious.)<br>  <br>  For some reason, a lot of people believe it's only possible for a child to have 1 or other of its parents' blood types. This is garbage. In fact, (as you can work out from the above if you really wanted to) an AB and O pairing couldn't have either AB or O children.|`|eiJY15Teaa	o+
QvrhmdAtaa	I advise you to be seen by a Gynecologist as soon as possible to rule out anything serious like infection or even Toxic Shock Syndrome. I would also get done whatever tests she wants and do what you can to relax and not worry in the mean time. It would do you well to get seen immediately. I hope it's not serious and I hope you feel better soon.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	It could be anemia.<br>  <br>  It could be migrains. I used to get them like that. <br>  <br>  See a doctor.|`|JHQiIl34aa	Sounds like your anaemic. Make sure your sleeping, drinking and eating enough and go to see the doctor.

7tJNspGNaa	They are usually bumpy, but can be the same colour as the skin; as well as very, very tiny.<br>  <br>  The only way to diagnose warts, however, is to have your doctor take a look. There is no test for the warts, so it's all what he sees. <br>  <br>  If there are warts on a female, they can be biopsied to check for cancer-causing HPV.<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|pOjPwxo8aa	Genital warts often occur in clusters and can be very tiny or can spread into large masses in the genital or penis area. When present, they usually are seen on the tip of the penis. They also may be found on the shaft of the penis, on the scrotum, or around the anus. Rarely, genital warts also can develop in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person.<br>  I hope this helps. MC

If you smoke that could contribute to that, it could also be heart issues.  Go to the doc. and ask them, they should be able to tell you more.  It's probably nothing major.|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	probably poor circulation in your feet.. try elevating them see if that helps if it doesnt go see a doctor and tell them they will help|`|AA10958492	Do you have low blood pressure?

L63BRwXbaa	well this is not unheard of, but i would still suggest seeing your ob/gyn, it could be a problem
HdOVYIWjaa	I have the same problem, and yes, your vision could be causing your headaches.  The best thing to do you've already done, your going to get your eyes checked and get glasses.  Once you get your glasses, wear them as directed and see if the headaches go away.  If not, go see your doctor or make an appointment for a neurologist.|`|kXesp8EHaa	Yes, vision problems can cause headaches.|`|268fbadb7ead2c9b7c16ca2a28b85c7baa	yes, they can!! and a problem on your head can also make you lose your sight!!<br>  I think you should go to visit a doctor!!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	YES!!!!
KuSxKsKHaa	Well, I don't know how valuable advice from a 16 year old can be but here goes!<br>  <br>  Stress is apparent no matter how much we think about it. Sometimes a lot of stress can affect us without us even thinking about it, resulting in sleeping problems and lack of focus. <br>  <br>  This sounds oddly like insomnia to me, maybe it's all about finding a deeper meaning to why you can't sleep? While i know a lot of people are against it, sometimes seeing a psychiatrist does help. <br>  <br>  Keep your cool, try to go to bed earlier, and if you really have to, take the sleeping pills. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope things get better.

Aoc9wRIqaa	Because it's about more than losing weight. It's about control, and other things as well. People don't consciously decide to have an eating disorder. It's a disease that kills people, and it's very difficult to recover from. An answer above said it's because people are "lazy." No, sweetie. It's because they have a mental illness. I'm recovered now, but when I was at my worst with anorexia, I was eating about 100 calories a day, as well as exercising far more than the average person. <br>  <br>  Really, it's impossible to understand if you haven't dealt with it yourself. Don't make yourself crazy trying to understand, because in reality, you can't.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	It's too easy to grab fast food anymore..and most of that isn't good for ya...Many people have too many things to do and don't find time to exercise.

Which i believe is a major part in why everyone wants to become skinny, people now start to think that if they are not skinny and i mean skin and bones skinny that they dont fit in, About the exercising and eating right people are lazy, now the common thing to do is to go home and watch tv or use the computer, many people think it is too much work to join a gym or just lay off the junk food and eat a fruit, people are lazy. and to stop people from feeling like they need to fast i think we need to teach people how to exercise and eat properly. it is also the food companies and the unhealthy foods they create themselves. And when people hear about models who starve themselves to be skinny then thats exactly what they want to do, they dont want to do it the hard way, they want do it lazily|`|QptIPG0Maa	there are alot of gullible and stupid ppl in the world|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Eating disorders aren't about fitness, diet and exercise. It's about distorted perceptions of one's body, and exerting a sense of personal control in a family (or world), in which one often feels out of control.
DfiHyjcLaa	I think you've answered your own question.  He's all you think about, you love him, he loves you and tells everyone.  He wants to marry you.

VHDXQhY6aa	yes, it is normal for hair to grow between your breasts, it sucks but it is.  it doesn't sound like a yeast infection, and depending on what the sores look like it could be razor burn, which can be itchy.  but also if you let the hair grow out some before you shave it could itch from it coming back.  i suggest something like aveeno for sensitive skin or the type for razor burn, and a gentle lotion on the outside (be really careful that you don't get any in the hairless area) after shaving.  if you're sexually active, you need to consider an std though, so if those don't work and you are, i would get tested...hope it helps :)|`|JHQiIl34aa	I get both of those things. The itches when it grow back after shaving and i get in growing ones too. The hair i have between my breasts i just pluck out|`|YvzcVxuFaa	the itching is normal i think its from shaving too thats what mine is from, it could be razor burn|`|H7HZXTaWaa	It could be herpes, you better go to the doctor.|`|jvOlKxhvaa	Um that doesnt sound good - if youve had a guy go down on you or had sex without protection (condom) then you might have an STD. If that isnt so then you might just have thrush (yeast infection) which can be cured with canesten cream and the pill/persery that comes with it - you can get it from the pharmacy or you doctor.<br>  Wear normal cotton knickers so your skin can breath down there and DO NOT scratch whatever you do. And dont use perfumed soaps down there either.<br>  Id get the hair between your boobs checked out too - not heard of that one. Good luck.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Maybe if you shave,ingrown hairs are very itchy and get red. Or dry skin?|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	It's probably from shaving. Shaving irritates our skin down there and also hair is growing back. The skin is being bothered. And yes, some girls have more hair than others but it's natural.
acHnMNr2aa	Yep. Unless it's nearly all water weight.<br>  <br>  The key thing to keep in mind is that only your muscles can burn fat. Unless you've turned into Michael Phelps or Lance Armstrong, you probably aren't burning an extra 4 pounds a week in body fat. Since each pound of body fat contains 3500 calories, that would mean that your muscles alone would have to be burning 2000 calories of pure fat every single day for that weight loss to be fat. <br>  <br>  A you probably know, you should be eating maybe 2000-2400 calories a day, maybe 40% of that in fat. That means your body is used to burning about 700-800 calories of fat a day. Now it's burning 2000? Not because you're exercising more, but because you're eating less?<br>  <br>  If you lose more than 1-2 pounds a week, and it's not water weight, your body is converting protein from your muscles into glucose. Your brain and internal organs can't burn fat, only blood sugar (glucose), and when they aren't getting enough glucose from your food, they get it from your muscles. Since you're losing muscle mass, when you start eating more normally, you will have less muscle to burn fat, so you'll put the fat back on more quickly than before. <br>  <br>  Fortunately, a good chunk (half?) of your weight loss is probably water weight, so it's not THAT bad. The other half, though, is mostly protein. Protein and sugar are about half as calorie dense as fat, so you can lose a fair amount of protein weight every day - but why would you want to do that?<br>  <br>  What you need to do for sustained fat loss is to eat sensibly and ADD muscle mass, so you can be burning fat all the time, even when you're sitting around. That means 1) weight training and 2) exercising using your body-weight-carrying big muscles, mostly in your legs and back/abdomen.|`|M6c0hUefaa	It sounds like you're doing everything well and your body is burning the fat like IT should. I've been on a diet for a little over a month too, and I've lost 18 pounds, so I don't think it's uncommon especially since you're dieting healthy. Good luck :)|`|yrSxi1pfaa	As long as you have a regular workout/exercise routine in place, that is great. Although, if you are working out daily, I would suggest taking your calorie intake up to possibly near 2000. I am 6'2 and 180lbs, and I consume approximately 2600+ calories per day. I do a heavy lifting workout daily though. But for your size, I would say you could probably consume a bit more. Because while your body is burning very fast(23 lbs in a month) you need to make sure you are still getting the proper amount of nutrients, healthy fats, protein, etc.  Just my thoughts.|`|7s5OU7Sxaa	most people might not think so but that's still alot of calories to be eating to have lost that much weight in that time span.i know because i ate 1300 to 1500cals a day for 5 months to lose 30lbs.<br>  so good for you.<br>  here's the only problem.<br>  you lost 23lbs but how much of it was fat and how much of it was muscle.<br>  the faster a person loses weight the better chance that a large amount of weight loss will be from muscles.  50% or more. so you could lose 50lbs and still have a high bodyfat for that weight.<br>  i started losing weight at 6',210lbs. lost 30lbs and 8lbs. of those were still muscle. took me 5 months.how do i know. i bought a bodyfat scale.been off the diet(also a lifestyle change) for 3months and havent gained back any weight.|`|AA11046205	You are doing great! The goal you have set for yourself is good too. Your quick weight loss in the beginning is also normal, and will slow down dramatically after a few weeks. Much of what you are loosing right now is water weight. You are on a good calorie amount, probably far less than what you had been on prior to now. Don't be discouraged as the weight loss slows All good vibes sent your way.|`|AA11108135	Good for you for doing something positive. As you go along, pace yourself. And remember the body/mind connection. Eat healthy meals, use herbs if appropriate. And try to keep a balance. This will help you to keep going.|`|7mKNHl2zaa	that seems really fast to lose wieght but if your not like 100lbs then your fine|`|9e53b6a1e4c79c8311327a565cfe4f43aa	Your doing GREAT. Keep up the great work as long as you eat good. Like lost of good vegetable and fruit. You can have protein and some good carb's stay away from white bread and white rice. You probably lost lot of water weight at first so I would not be worry. Keep drinking lots of water. For a teenager this is good way to start before you become in your 20's and it keeps you feeling better. Make sure you check which weight you are suppose to be with your height. I am 5'9 and weight at 142, which is good for my age and height. Checking your BMI you are just over weight your BMI  should be 20-25 range and yours is 26.6. So keep up the good work.|`|30891a369d5cf02d3d1af56207759d0eaa	You're eating awfully few calories.  Check with your doctor to see if that's okay.  You're eating the same amount as I am and I'm a 5'5" female...men in general need more calories because they have more muscle.  In addition to that, you're tall and still growing.  You probably need to eat more.  I know you've seen results, but it might not be healthy for you.  Please talk to your doctor.|`|ktNhvdR0aa	you  could just have a really fast metabolism.|`|VBmXurOfaa	Wow! That's really good! And as long as your happy and NOT going anerixoic lol you fine!

I mean do you think it wants to keep all that bacteria in there every single day? If your really annoyed with it, you can use liners. It also happens before and after you start your period. But if your worried you can see a doctor to check it's not yeast infection.|`|6HhO1Evfaa	Sounds like:<br>  <br>  It might be a yeast infection.  White flaky stuff in your underwear is a sign but this doesn't quite sound like that.<br>  <br>  I have that happen sometimes.  I will sit down and not have to go potty but then some clear stuff comes out.  It's not anything to worry about with me, it is just my vagina cleaning itself out.  My mom told me this and nothing happened except for liquid coming out and my vagina cleaning itself!  I have not had my period though.  It think that is normal but I was freaked out at first too.|`|Jy69Dn9Maa	You seem fine, I think it is just discharge anad compleley normal, as long as it doesn't itch your good, or have a fishy smell and is like green, but just wait a week and see if it goes away, I would just take a bath and wash down there maybe wash some of it out.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Once you start puberty a white and/or clear discharge is normal. The vagina is self-cleaning. This same discharge increases the closer you get to ovulation and when you are sexually aroused. Trust me, you don't ever want it to go away.  <br>  <br>  You can wear a pantyliner if it bothers you. Some girls do produce more discharge than others, but most doctors won't do anything about it unless you've had an abnormal pap..<br>  <br>  Exercise, meds, illness, diet and water intake can all effect the consistency of your discharge.<br>  <br>  Different Types of Discharge:<br>  <br>  White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.<br>  <br>  Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.<br>  <br>  Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina. Old blood looks brown. This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Your first period can look like this also.<br>  <br>  Different types of infections:<br>  <br>  Signs of yeast infections:<br>  White, cottage cheese-like discharge <br>  Swelling and pain around the vulva <br>  Intense itching .<br>  For about 1 in 4 women, a yeast infection will go away after her period, but most of us can't wait that long to see if it goes away.  You can try UNsweetened yogurt (as sugar feeds yeast), probiotics or buy Monistat over-the-counter at a drug or grocery store.)<br>  <br>  Signs of bacterial vaginosis:<br>  A white, gray or yellowish vaginal discharge <br>  A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap <br>  Itching or burning <br>  Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva <br>  <br>  Signs of trichomoniasis<br>  A watery, yellowish or greenish bubbly discharge <br>  An unpleasant odor <br>  Pain and itching when urinating <br>  Most apparent after your period|`|DfiHyjcLaa	Since you're a virgin and the discharge isn't itchy or has a foul odor..it sounds like normal cervical mucus.<br>  <br>  Basically, your body goes through changes in the vagina (cervix actually) at different stages in your period.  When you are fertile, the mucus will become stretchy and look like egg-whites.  Other times during your cycle, it will be sticky or pasty.<br>  <br>  So it just sounds like you're in your fertile period.  Since you're not sexually active (good thing), you have nothing to worry about.  Perfectly normal.|`|JHQiIl34aa	Sounds like your ovulating. Don't panic it's normal. im afraid being female is full of surprises and it doesn't change much with age. During your full cycle your discharge will go from cloudy/creamy white, to watery/clear, to stringy like eggwhite (thats ovulation) to sticky and finally dry before your period. Sorry hun it's part of growing up.|`|f8VfAP78aa	Well thats pretty intresting, because i'm having sounds like the same problem but no health problems or anything. I had my last period the end of Jan. I really couldn't tell you, I was thinking about mabe going to the doctor if it didn't let up, its messy! So hopefully somebody could help us.|`|hofFm31Jaa	its just discharge.discharge is a clear white-ish liquid that comes from the vagina right before your period.so you dont need to worry about anything its normal :) :)|`|c7sPgh4Zaa	It could be a yeast infection. But to be on the safe side just go to the doc sweetheart.|`|NBi07o6zaa	Talk to your mother about it and go see a doctor.|`|SYaSbJb5aa	it's probably completely normal.  if it really freaks you out, go to your doctor and get a PAP test.|`|XCrtAUTpaa	i thought that was normal umm wear a pantie liner|`|991f716c47301a3eba91a0ffe6adb6a2aa	Its nooooooooormal.<br>  No worries, hun (:|`|i99sv2Tvaa	I think this is pretty normal. u probaby shouldn't worry, but could always visit your GP if it's bothering you
qitXGd0qaa	Its completely normal to not get your first period until you're 16. If you are or are considering becoming sexually active, I would recommend visiting an OB/Gyn. Its not impossible to get pregnant before having your first period.<br>  <br>  Honestly, consider yourself lucky. I started my period when I was 11 years old and there's nothing fun about it.|`|TZlBh9XBaa	sometimes people get their period at a later time.when did your mom have her period?when did your mom's mom have her period? this is a heridetary thing yours will most likely come around the time that their period came.a year or 2 later is completely normal.your period will come when your body is ready :)|`|BUOJJpaCaa	Do not worry. People develop at different rates. I'm sure the doctors will be more worried if you're eighteen and haven't started it yet.<br>  <br>  At this point, it's only a waiting game. Some people just don't start their periods until later in life.|`|VPVg792eaa	Nothing is wrong with you, sounds to me like you are worrying a little to much all women start at different times when your body is ready it will happen,<br>  If nothing happens by the time you are 16 talk to your doctor about it <br>  <br>  best wishes
F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

During this , you will eat normal meals of chicken, beef, turkey, fish, and shellfish, lots of vegetables, eggs, cheese, nuts, and garden salads using 100% olive oil for your salad dressing. Each day for 14 days, you will eat three, well-balanced meals. While eating until your hunger is satisfied may go against most diets.
9pLdhuBnaa	The moodiness, sore stomach, headaches can be an indication that your period is coming.<br>  <br>  However, I would recommend letting your mom know what's going on so that she can help you keep an eye on this.
tMtBe1lKaa	Where and how deep? Our friend cut his foot with a chiansaw, and wrapped it in duct tape. That DOESN'T work. If it is that deep, or on your face, see a doctor. If the cuts aren't that deep, and whatever cut you was sanitaryish, wash the areas well with soap and warm water, or take a shower. Then you can put some rubbing alcohol or iodine on the areas, and some antibiotic cream or neosporin type ointment, and bandage. There are some bandages that actually heal faster than others. Go to the pharmacist at your local drugstore or walmart and ask for "OP-SITE" type bandages. These let the area breath, but cover with a protective film that really helps reduce scarring and possibility of infection (it stays on longer too.).<br>  good luck.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	Neosporin + Vitamin E gels squished on your scab

ILUYVQ0naa	do you live at high altitude, that could cause your hematocrit to be high and and your hemoglobin levels are usually 1/3 of hematocrit so high hematocrit can equal high hemoglobin levels, idk if this is possible but it could be from smoking bc you get less O2 causing hight hematocrit, but that is a shot in the dark|`|7DY3fCdraa	polycythemia..............if hgb gets too high can strain the heart....may need a pint removed............|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Having high haemoglobin levels is known as polycythaemia. Smokers typically have higher haemoglobin values than non smokers. Dehydration can cause high levels of haemoglobin and it can also be an indication of lung disease and various other medical conditions.  <br>  <br>  If you are living at high altitudes, your levels may be raised as your body's natural response to decreased oxygen levels at that altitude.<br>  <br>  The main complication that polycythaemia causes is  increased thickness of the blood- this can lead to a reduction in blood supply to the organs and you are also more at risk from blood clots. You need to stop smoking, plain and simple.

It sounds like you were given a smoke with pot in it. This would be the reason you became giggly at first, then paranoid. Those are the effects of THC in marijuana. Relax and ride it out, if it gets worse contact EMT's.|`|89d27567349c27bb47932ae184cbd82baa	Sounds like you got a marijuana cigarette buddy....<br>  <br>  <br>  and if you got this feeling pretty strong, it very well may have been laced...<br>  <br>  no worries, you'll be fine......<br>  <br>  <br>  dont go borrowing cigarettes any more, you never know what you'll get|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	Sounds exactly like the effects of weed, but how could you not notice a distinct difference in the cigarette before you started/right when you started smoking it?|`|FtkoBEVpaa	Why are you bumming a smoke from a stranger?  Be more careful next time.|`|Vfv92UZQaa	more than likely it was pot.... but if you smoke ciggies you would immediately notice the smell and taste... I do know that when I don't have a cig for a while and i smoke one.. i get light headed and feel much like as if I were high but it's only momentarily and usually goes away by the time I'm done with the cig.|`|96mGtuzkaa	1. guys, bumming cigarettes is not stupid. everyone does it. <br>  2. I'm not sure why everyone is saying it was marijuana, there is a distinct difference in the smell, taste and overall feeling you experience while high on cannabis. <br>   3. If you haven't had a cig in a while you may feel momentarily euphoric but it would not last that long.<br>  4. You may have just experienced a cig laced will something else such as cocain or X. although im not sure why a complete stranger would give that to you mostly because they cost a lot. <br>  Not sure what to tell you. there are many possibilities.|`|n108YoG7aa	Um...basically, what''s going on is that you are an idiot.<br>  No pot smoker would accidentally bum a joint to a random stranger.<br>  Plus............if you know anything at all, marijuana doesn't look, smell, or taste like tobacco.<br>  <br>  DUR!!|`|BxU2NBIKaa	not weed it doent cause euphoric state|`|mWBD1Mgyaa	Are you sure it wasn't marijauna?
OHs8yJiOaa	Partially depends on which model lenses you did. Every now and then there's a flavor that people have issues with, or sometimes people legitimately get a freaky lens.<br>  <br>  Polarized lenses should reduce glare from horizontal surfaces like grass, water, and roads. They do play games with some things like LCD screens, or can make some lighting appear a little bizarre, but it shouldn't be brighter or more reflective.<br>  <br>  It's possible there's something with your contacts, or just placement on your head isn't working well with the way light is refracting. Decent odds you got a bad lens or chose a flavor that might not be good -- some things like the G26 are made solely for target shooting, for example, and wouldn't go over too well outside of that.<br>  <br>  I'd read up on your model lens at the following, and if others aren't reporting issues, try a replacement pair and perhaps even a different lens flavor if possible. If you have an Oakley dealer nearby, that might be an easier way to handle things than by mail with Oakley.
tnu4mYKAaa	You may have a hormonal imbalance as I had at your age. Acne,weight gain or loss are also symptoms of hormonal imbalance.  You should see your doctor and he will most likely put you on birth control (because it will regulate you period).<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Dysmenorrhea a occurrance of painful cramps during menstruation. More than half of all girls and women suffer from dysmenorrhea (cramps), a dull or throbbing pain that usually centers in the lower mid-abdomen, radiating toward the lower back or thighs. Menstruating women of any age can experience cramps.<br>  <br>  While the pain may be only mild for some women, others experience severe discomfort that can significantly interfere with everyday activities for several days each month.|`|SYaSbJb5aa	Yeah, unfortunately this can happen.  One of my girlfriends has it really bad, where she was prescribed contraceptives that seem to ease her pain.|`|rxScdXM4aa	yes, sometimes the fluctuation of hormones can cause this reaction...it would happen to one of my good friends when i was in high school|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	That has happenned to me before too.

DfiHyjcLaa	Jess don't confuse him!  The cervix doesn't have a lining...its the shedding of the uterus lining that results in a period (because the egg is not fertilized and therefore the lining is not needed to nourish the egg).<br>  <br>  NO, its nothing like male ejaculate.  That's the expulsion of semen from the penis during an orgasm.<br>  <br>  Yeah, you're probably too young to know.|`|r5kHFJOHaa	i think he thinks that a females period is like a males ejaculation.<br>  which its not. at all.<br>  a period is a woman releasing the liner of her cervix when she is not pregnant and the egg is not fertilized.|`|EkLJDcc7aa	if you dont know by now.<br>  your too young to know.|`|fN2xiQL7aa	Are you serious?|`|4lrdrWSpaa	There are periods, semi colons, exclamations, etc. in a key board but not "of female".

kogsyGAPaa	I think if you have no other symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, hair thinning, weight gain, bloating, headaches, etc) then probably not. The pill is likely to screw up your menstrual cycle especially a little bit after stopping it. Your changes of pregnancy might be slimming down as you are probably getting close to menopause considering your moms age. <br>  Best wishes!|`|bJnLmvkqaa	Menopause is possible at your (our) age but periods get messed up when you get off of the pill. It could also be PCOS, which is not a big deal either. You'll probably want to report your skipped period to the doctor's office but I don't expect they're going to make you a rush appointment. Probably just tell you to call if you don't get your monthly in a few weeks.|`|DfiHyjcLaa	Sounds like it could be the onset of menopause.  The symptoms of menopause and pregnancy are very similar.  However, since you recently went off birth control pills, it could take a couple months for your body to get back to normal and have a regular cycle.<br>  <br>  Also, since your mom started menopause at 46, that's a big factor that you could be starting also.|`|NgsEroT5aa	it could be menopause. my grandmother got it around her 40s and it laster for about 5 years. if your sweating, and have bad cramps and hot flashes & such..go see the doctor =)|`|qwHAAvC6aa	well youre at that age so its possibly menopause just have a talk with your doctor.

It will rob you of any desire to do anything at all.  So if you have no ambitions and want nothing out of life then weed is a great way to go.|`|AA11871081	Its just as bad as smoking with people health wise. But if you mean mentally I guess it would make me depressed and really bored and paranoid. Its not bad or good I guess to answer your question|`|fN2xiQL7aa	How did you even have the brain cells to even ask this question?|`|iFqVfAF0aa	I do not smoke weed anymore, but I used to so I feel qualified to answer this question.  If you are going to smoke, it really does not matter if you smoke alone or with other people.  This is different from Alcohol because many people drink to become more social.  Most people smoke weed because they like the buzz.  I used to prefer to smoke alone when in nature, such as hiking or camping.  Smoking weed is bad for your health, so if you smoke "alot"  you are at a risk of getting lung cancer, or various other health issues.  One joint a day is more than enough, if you smoke more that that you should consider cutting back.|`|DfKdzD46aa	its not good. for me at least, when i started smoking alone it took away from alot of the pleasure i used to have with it, it is also more likely that you are using it to escape like (even if it is only escaping bordem) which then make it much easier for you to become addicted or dependent to it. It is not a good thing and should be avoided|`|FA4j3KfLaa	hell no...i smoke weed all the time<br>  keeps me from being stressed and keeps me eating<br>  healthy<br>  allows me to calm down and think better<br>  and you never bored but sometimes its funner to smoke with<br>  someone else cuz your not alone|`|CrZxYK5raa	it is not a good idea i think that you should <br>  get some help. it costs way to much money <br>  and you are hurting yourself. try to stop talk <br>  to someone you can trust about this before it <br>  get to late.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	I prefer smoking alone.

fuLy0Xtwaa	If increasing flexibility is mainly what you seek, I would suggest the book "Stretching", by Bob Anderson. <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stretching-20th-Anniversary-Revised-Anderson/dp/0936070226/ref=sr_1_1/190-9064000-0581210?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235161444&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Stretching-20th-An...</a><br>  <br>  It's a classic on the subject. <br>  If cost is a concern, see if your library has it, or perhaps ordering a less expensive used copy is an option. <br>  <br>  <br>  A well rounded yoga practice (actually asana practice, the way most Westerners practice Hatha yoga), is a mix of postures that in addition to flexibility, equally develop balance and strength. <br>  <br>  Generally, the more advanced poses require significant amounts of all three at once, the easier poses requiring only one of those attributes at a time. <br>  <br>  Broadly speaking, one main factor that distinguishes practicing yoga asana and simple stretching, is the degree of mindfulness one makes an effort in bringing to their asana practice.  <br>  <br>  Unless there is something about yoga that interests you beyond simply increasing flexibility, the above book will offer all you need without all the other details/baggage that can accompany yoga. <br>  <br>  <br>  Namaste',<br>  dwb

And I have had it for 2 years.<br>  I say go for it if you dont want to have to remember to take a pill all the time thats why I love it.

gIsMXFkGaa	lip gloss, mascara, n wear perfume..<br>  more than that is too much|`|qitXGd0qaa	In my opinion, NONE.<br>  <br>  But lip gloss and maybe a tinted moisturizer type foundation would be plenty.|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	dont ever feel like you have to wear make up! If everyone jumped off a bridge would you follow them?|`|VHDXQhY6aa	mascara and some colored lip gloss would be ok, and if you wanted a little more, you could buy some of the shimmery powder, the type that goes over foundation, but is loose and when you put it on alone it doesn't cover anything up but gives your face a slight glow...that being said, i understand what it's like to be in 6th grade and want to wear makeup, but don't overdo it or you'll look like a clown.  i would go with brown mascara, nearly neutral but maybe slightly pink lipgloss, and again, the shimmery powder, but use a brush, dip it in, and roll it between your hands to knock off the excess before you put it on-you don't want to look trashy, and with the powder, you're only going for a slight shimmer anyway.|`|gpp3F2Kyaa	im 13 and i wear some lip gloss and mascara so yea thats fine.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	at  just do you eyes up ..|`|mLvjGWPbaa	You don't have to if you don't want to. But if you want to, I'd recommend using lip gloss and maybe eyeliner.

If you do wear mascara, get some good remover. : )<br>  <br>  Mom didn't let me wear makeup until I was eleven, but then it was just mostly a little bit of eyeshadow and liner. You don't need that much makeup at all, and the whole point of makeup is to enhance your features without making you look like you're wearing it. If I were you, I'd talk to your mom about this and get her opinion. Maybe she can help you out.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you learn how to apply it correctly and don't wear too much. And remember you're pretty enough without it, sometimes it's just fun. : ) lol. hope I helped, dear.|`|taFHiG5naa	Just because everyone else wears make-up doesn't mean you should.<br>  <br>  Anyways I doubt any boys in your grade would even be appreciative of the make-up (Not that women need it), if they're anything like I was back then they probably think its a useless annoyance since they're used to their mothers/sisters always being late (sorry for stereotype, personal experience here) because they were doing their make-up.<br>  <br>  Don't use make up at 11, you don't need it and your letting your natural beauty go to waste.|`|TvuaHx48aa	I would just wear some lip gloss and eyeshadow because more then that at your age would just make you look slutty!

It's plenty for your age.|`|ppnOaDMvaa	blush, perfume, lip gloss and MAYBE a little mascara|`|3n5I4FRcaa	None?|`|2mFvVbVmaa	that's more than enough.. i'd go with chapstick instead of gloss though
0xXW4Lozaa	It isn't just the smoking, you're out of shape in general. I have a friend who smokes a pack a day and runs 5 miles straight! I myself am in your shoes, ex smoker who's on the quest for fitness. You just have to have patience... and do interval training. I find that if I start with a solid 10 minutes of stretching, and then a slow jog, run, then walk-- repeat-- for about two miles it helps build up stamina. I've been doing this for a week and already can see the difference. Vary your routines, get outside and jog! It's 17 degrees in michigan but  you feel damn accomplished after spending that time outside. Bike, dance, run, swim- break it up and you will find yourself in shape in no time!
EV1Z1AWCaa	Any time you get up and get moving, and get your heart rate going for at least 20 minutes it's good|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	Sure, everybody has a preference on how to work out - some people love exercise videos. Just make sure the workout is challenging enough to increase your heart rate and make you sweat a little. (If it's not enough of a workout, you won't see good results.)|`|WL7nKDplaa	If you stick to them, I'm sure they do. I, however, can't stick to them. It seems like it takes too long, blah blah blah. So I keep my workout simple and only need my body. :) But if you stick to them, I'm sure they're great.|`|sY6ZI2Ooaa	Yes I think so, it's better than going to the gym because you can do it at your leisure.. but that brings up problem # 1 getting motivated @ home. Some people can't stay motivated at home (myself included) but I've found I'm more consistent if I do it at home to a video.|`|7s5OU7Sxaa	depends on the person<br>  some people need the guidance and inspiration<br>  also will depend on the video.<br>  some of them are hype and BS. lots of the people in the video didn't really use that method to obtain that level of fitness.|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	There are some really good ones out there. They absolutely help.|`|AA11046205	Oh yes ! Early morning TV work outs at the hospital get all the old men up and alert. I'm sure gets their heart rates up with out even breaking a sweat. On a more serious note, anything that will help you exercise is good. Everyone has a method, just need to find the one that works best for you. Have fun !|`|21ToYoBDaa	use whatever one motivates you. if u dont like workout videos then try working out with a friend. whatever keeps you inspired to do it everyday and not give up.|`|012f12e232d8e79e847320dd32943a10aa	Yes!   I think so. I use one called "Walk away the pounds" and it's great.
pMmOXlZ6aa	Not possible unless you really want to destroy your body. Safe amount is 1-2 lbs per week*. 6-9 if you weigh like 200 pounds|`|avEmEWO7aa	that is undoable. it is possible to lose 1-2 pounds per week healthily. Maximum probably about 12 pounds you could lose in 1 week if you pretty much stopped eating, which i am certaininly not suggesting.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	hahahahaha<br>  <br>  OMG<br>  <br>  hahahaha<br>  <br>  Are you serious??!!|`|UtRjy7Isaa	If you want long term results, you will do it reasonably.  <br>  <br>  If you want to lose 20 pounds and lose 12 inches of body fat to achieve wash board abs, thinner thighs and body fat all around, do what I did. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/stuntactorsafaftra" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/stuntactorsafaftr...</a><br>  <br>  Study reveals average fat loss of 4.4 pounds and 2.2 inches lost each month.|`|F8EnH6JQaa	NOW THAT IS CRAZY........<br>  <br>  TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water. I usually eat a meal of what ever I want once a week....controlled portion....this really works.........<br>  <br>  Write down every thing you eat|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	Short of lopping off appendages, there is no way. Do you realize that's a calorie deficit of 157,500 calories?|`|OVlxNuLfaa	impossible...lol|`|acHnMNr2aa	Cut off your leg?<br>  <br>  A lotta crystal meth? (That way you lose teeth, too. They have to weigh something, right?)<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you want to lose 45 pounds of FAT. Since each pound of fat contains 3500 calories, that means you need your muscles to burn 22,500 calories of fat alone every day. <br>  <br>  Your body normally burns 2000 calories or so every day. Maybe 35-40% of that is fat used by your muscles. So you normally burn maybe 700 calories of fat every day. Now you want to burn 22,500? Even Michael Phelps or Lance Armstrong at peak training intensity couldn't do half of that.<br>  <br>  Only your muscles can burn fat. Your brain and internal organs burn only glucose, converted in a pinch (like a crash diet) from the protein in your muscles.<br>  <br>  You do the math. The only way to get fat off your body is for your muscles to burn it. So the only way to take fat off your body is to 1) increase your muscle mass - weight training and 2) use the big weight-bearing muscles in your body a lot more, your legs, back, and abdomen.|`|sY6ZI2Ooaa	Hunnie, it took you time to put it on & it may take you twice as long to take it off... because taking it off hurts more!!  Be consistent in a workout routine, drink lots of water & give it time!|`|9SXnUOb3aa	Liposuction is the only way. LOL.<br>  <br>  45 pounds should take 2-12 months to lose.|`|E39bnZz4aa	It is not possible unless you weigh 1000lbs|`|012f12e232d8e79e847320dd32943a10aa	if you find out, let me know!<br>  <br>  Seriously....are you serious?|`|Hw8EcWmjaa	Hahaha ya right
JN6LWA6Oaa	Well, girls from the age of 15-16 that are 5'4 should weigh 120-123 pounds. So, you are a tad over wieght, nothing to really worry about.|`|WlywfjG1aa	I think for your age and height it is correct weight. Also if you bf is able to lift you easily , should not be a problem ! - Kidding as I know you !|`|VHmNfHa6aa	your fine. the easy way to see about around the weight you should be at is:<br>  100lbs for the first 5 feet and 5lbs for every inch after that.<br>  so for someone 5"4' around 120lbs. I am the same hight as you and got up to 130lbs once. now i am down at 112lbs. not suggesting you go on a diet though.|`|21ToYoBDaa	go to kidshealth.com and search bmi
kogsyGAPaa	Brownies, Icecream cake, or cheesecake<br>  that is if calories don't matter :)<br>  otherwise, im sticking to starvation right now. haha jk|`|012f12e232d8e79e847320dd32943a10aa	Popcorn from the movies.|`|lhrQNbZQaa	either pizza hut's 'hot cookie dough' dessert or some ben and jerry's cookie dough ice-cream. <br>  ...yeah i like cookie dough ;P|`|Ma1dZdDiaa	anything italian!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nnBAnBOlaa	It often takes over a year for a young woman to have a regular menstrual  pattern.  Even then there can still be an occasional late or early period for no obvious reason.<br>  <br>  I am an RN.|`|JKM7CEpnaa	Your just having a lighter period this month. Don't worry about it. I would be worried you were soaking pads and wouldn't stop bleeding. Just be grateful your not having a heavy period this month just enjoy the light flow.<br>  <br>  Have A Great Day|`|jBIaUfUzaa	on average a period can last from (3-9) days and can range from light spotting to soaking an entire maxi pad every few hours every womans cycle is different when you get allot older you will notice your cycle  will change an may become allot heavier i was just like you when i was your age i had really light periods i allways thought i wasnt normal because everyone else had heavy cycles but not me, but now im much older an have heavier cycles my doctor told me that that was perfectly normal .. what your going threw is absoluetly normal an if you have any concerns ask your mother of family physician<br>  hope this helped|`|m7crO0phaa	You will notice that your period will not always be the same, some months its heavy, some it is light and sometimes , you don't even get it for a month...<br>  <br>  It depends on your stress level, your hormones, and lots of other things.. so no worries!|`|xnrGEJZQaa	its normal at a young age for the bleeding to be different like one month its light one month its heavy<br>  dont worry<br>  you bodies hormones level are changing and your hormones are less active now and didnt give you much of a period flow!<br>  its normal xoxox
7s5OU7Sxaa	a person requires absolutely not exercise to lose weight.just reduced calorie intake.<br>  the main advantage that exercise can have is that it can help retain muscle so that primarily fat is lost when on a diet.<br>  and it requires  minimal exercise to retain muscle. one upper body exercise and one lower body  strength exercise. <br>  no cardio exercise required. it's a myth,a lie,BS.<br>  it's 10x easier to eat less than it is to exercise more|`|21ToYoBDaa	um usually if u lose weight in a small period of time its usually water weight. if u want to lose water weight then you can take diuretics or something that makes you less bloated. im not a doctor anything its just my advice|`|ur1bnkrZaa	cut off dead weight like your left arm. maybe some toes.<br>  be creative, whens the last time you needed your right teat?<br>  <br>  with this program i will have you shedding pounds in minutes!|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	What is more important than being healthy and fit. If you cant make the time for your own health than you know your doing too much|`|22c62deec8de00bc570cec69eda38a6caa	Eating healthy and being active!!! <br>  Cut greasy, fried, food. <br>  Opt for veggies, and food that's baked or grilled. <br>  NO WHITE BREAD! wheat only! <br>  No FAST FOOD...NO SODA or sugary drinks. Drink water! It's so important!<br>  Also, try substituting chicken and fish for red meat (ie pork and beef). <br>  All this sounds so obvious. But so many people fail to follow through. <br>  <br>  It's important to be active. For example, walking whenever you can. Riding a bike, playing with your kids/siblings/etc.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	Fiber one cereal for breakfast with fruit.  Slimfast for lunch. Then a healthy dinner.  lots of water during the day|`|Q5Nn9Fxoaa	I've herd Heroin works wonders, oh but then you have to deal with that whole addiction thing!  Listen the poster above is right, diuretics are probably the quickest way.  Also change your diet.  Start eating more vegetables, less complex carbs.  "diets" are hard becuase everbody has a different body chemistry.  Try going to a nutritionist, they can be expensive, but they will do a full body work up and design a diet plan that is IDEAL for YOU.  But rapid weight loss is never healthy!  Don't be so vein, be happy with what you have.  If your not, it's going to take effort and work to make it to where you want to be.
