I need to buy a large amount of items from a wholesale distribution center. I'm a nail technician and I need to buy everything from a gallon (cheap but heavy) of acetone to small rubber bottle tilters. One distribution center is near my house and I could drive there directly without paying shipping, and the other is far away and I would have to pay shipping. The problem is that the one by my house is significantly more expensive than the one that would  have to ship to me. For instance 32 oz of acetone at the one far away is $3.95 and 32 oz of acetone from the one by my home is $4.95. I've had so much on my mind so my brain is mush right now. I'm just starting my business so I need to get the best price possible in order to make a profit. Not to mention I suck at numbers. I would appreciate some advise. =)

20090226195738AAUyuMn	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Which Fed Regulation covers notifying the borrower of loan sale?	Ironically, I was a mortgage Compliance Officer for 10 years, But I can't seem to recall which federal regulation covers the requirement that a bank is required to notify the borrower when the bank sells the borrower's loan to another investor.  I'm thinking it's a Reg C (HMDA) issue, but I can't find that specific section.      My question is, even if a bank retains the loan servicing rights (i.e. receives the monthly payments), isn't the bank still required to notify the borrower of the sale of the loan?  I know the lender must notify the borrower when selling the loan AND servicing (as the borrower must know where to send payments), but what about just selling the loan to an investor (e.g. Fannie Mae or Freddy Mac)?  Isn't the lender still required to notify the borrower of the sale?      Please help.  Thx.

20090226201122AAbkr82	Business & Finance;Credit	Credit Recovery Agency and what they can do...?	So i have this unpaid credit card (visa) with a balance of 1, 495.03$ with i have not made even minimum payments on due to complications in other areas of life.      My intention was not to avoid payment but put it to a later date where i could permit myswelf to pay without putting myself behind in other things.      So a credit recovery agency sent me a letter telling me that i have ''10 days'' to pay the full amount or legal proceedings will commence. As i already said i was not avoiding any further payment so i called the credit recovery agency the same day i got the letter and we agreed on a first payment by next Thursday to be that of 149.00$ becuase i am a student and already broke :P      But she said this was a temporary agreement and that it would not be settled as a pre month payment that following this payment of 149.00$ the rest would need to be payed in total shortly after. I went on to tell this woman that it was impossible for me, a student already with my head just above water and with a crappy part time job to cover my rent to be able to come up with 1, 290.00$ within 5 days.      I do not borrow from family nor friends as i am too independant for that.      Is there a standard amount in Quebec wich a credit recovery company can come and take things here to cover the amount owed?      Isn't true thast as long as you agree to pay the debt and make monthly payments that they can't do anything?      I don't own a house, no car and aside from this unpaid bill my credit report is clean. This worries me because the computer equipment i have here in my appartment is used for school work in 3D animation and i don't wannt to come home to find my equipment gone...      Any insight on this would be GREATLY appreciated.

We are planning to buy our first home and were wondering if there is a way we can look at the homes ourselves instead of an agent showing us.      The thing here is the time factor, whenever we ask the agent to show us some properties, they are only willing to do in weekends and could only spare around 2-3 hrs and not more than that. Reason might be they are either part-time agents or busy with some other clients during other times.      All I have seen most of the times is our agent calling someone and getting the code to unlock the vacant home and showing it to us.       Can we do this ourselves and when we feel we are more interested in the property then I can get the agent look deep into the property and give us the guidelines

Ok, so on February 13th my roommate (also landlord) let me know that her sister wants to move into the apartment and that I have until March 31st to move out. That evening I let her know right away that I would be out by the end of February. She told me if I needed more time just to let her know, never mentioning anything about March rent. Two weeks go by and this weekend is the end of february. I asked her if it would be a problem if I was out by next weekend (due to difficulty getting people to help me move). She said it was not a problem that I can take my time since I will be paid up until the end of march. Then I told her that I'm not going to pay for an entire month if I'm just staying an extra week and that I would be out this weekend no matter what. Now she is demanding that I pay her rent for the entire month of march because her sister isn't moving in until April and that she gave me a 45 day notice...I told her that it was a miss communication because I said from the very beginning that I would be out before march and since I wouldn't be staying here anymore assumed that I wouldn't be paying for it. She negotiated down to half of the rent for the month but I'm still not seeing how this is fair, she asked me to move out? I need an outside opinion and want to know what my rights and what her rights are. Thank you!!

20090226205525AAnD6Zz	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Our landlord doesn't have a walk through checklist from when we moved in, can she keep our deposit?	We rented a house from friends of ours in Feb. 2007.  When we moved in they had US clean up the outside of the house that was trashed from the previous renters.  They asked us to take pictures so that they could pay us and sue the previous tenants for the money to clean it up.  We spent 12 hours (2 people) cleaning the property (2 acres) and then when the landlord decided not to sue, they never paid us.  We do have the pictures however to show the condition of the outside of the house.   Since they were our friends, they didn't do a walk through and said they trusted we would fix things and have them in the same order.  The house was built in 1890 and is falling apart.  The foundation is sinking, the pipes are old, there is even the old wallpaper falling apart on the walls.  It has old country charm but is in serious need of some upgrades.   We had a falling out with the landlord in Dec. 2008 because the pipes froze and broke and they said they didn't have the money to fix them.  They insisted that my husband help them fix the pipes (with no compensation) and that we were not good parents to our children for letting them go without water!!!  Needless to say we refused to help them fix it and moved out immediately.   The landlord now says that we did alot of damage and left furniture in the house that was actually there when we moved in.  My relatives helped us move in and will testify to the things that were left there and the condition when we moved in.  But since there is no inspection or pictures of the inside, can the landlord withold our deposit?      thanks!

I'm interested in learning more about sending out mass text messages for marketing.       I've recently heard a little about where you can send text messages to anyone in 1 mile radius with promotions or sales, etc.       Like if they were driving by, without knowing their number, they could receive a text message.         Maybe it's a myth? If anyone could shed some light on the subject I would greatly appreciate it.
20090226205931AAqCbHB	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Job application help?	I am applying to be a reservations assistant at my university.

20090226213811AAawhI3	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Tips about getting a roommate?	My husband is about to leave for USMC boot camp in 3 weeks. We decided to rent out our extra room while he's gone, to help with the bills until he starts getting paychecks. The girl is coming over tomorrow to look at the room and see if its a good fit.      So what are some tips on having a roommate? I'm uneasy about this just because I tend to be possessive of my stuff, and since we own all the furniture and utensils and appliances, I'm just nervous about things. But on the other hand, I probably won't make it without some assistance with rent and utils since until my husband graduates, we'll be missing half of our income.       So any tips on how to have a roommate?
20090226193310AA5HDuN	Business & Finance;Investing	Question about cars and budgeting?	I apologize for posting it in this section but I need answers and no one else is answering in the other sections. I figure people who invest would know better anyway.   (Skip to question at bottom first)   DETAILS:   I make 250-300 a week. I have about 1000 in the bank. I would like this car (Or similar one)  http://baltimore.craigslist.org/cto/1017...     which is $7750. Take out a $1000 that I have saved and I would need a loan of $6750. If I get it for 5 years it would be $113 a month (Plus interest). I can afford this but I need to consider insurance cost, which is where I get lost. About how much would it be for an 18 year old male. As you can tell by the picture it's nt gonna be cheap (2 Doors, red, GT in name, etc.). I am going to be put under my parents insurancve so that will help.   QUESTIONS:   Do you think I can afford this car (I'm considereing saving another 1000 first)?   Should I just pay cash for my first car and buy a junky car with a lot of mileage or am i safe getting something like this?      PS I'm not planning on getting this exact car, but same brand and price range.
20090226214521AAgJply	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Legal question about "home association" dues?	I bought this house in 1990...Promptly after I moved in I got a "bill" from the home owners association for "past dues"...   I didn't really understand it but I paid it..   About 7 years ago, I was talking with an acquaintance who used to work as a real estate agent and the subject came up...I had been paying these "dues" every year since 1990...   Come to find out, the association dues should have been disclosed to me when I purchased my house...Legally he said, I didn't have to pay it since I didn't know about the "dues" until after I purchased the house...   I was going through a divorce that year and I took his advice and quit paying it..   Now it's 7 years later and I'm getting threatening letters telling me that the "Association President", a lonely old grouchy neighbor, lol...Is going to hire a lawyer if I don't pay up 7 years worth of "dues"  right away...   What are my legal rights here ? Should I go ahead and pay it even though I don't think I owe it ? If she hires a lawyer can I take the association to court to prove my point ?   I mean seriously...Everyone in this neighborhood pays these "dues" and the only thing that the "dues" are spent on is a dumpster once a year for us to clean up our yards...SOMEONE is pocketing a lot of money here !
20090226215414AAmyABJ	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I found out today I will lose my contract hours?	I am depressed, but I give my confession on Yahoo!Answers as directed.      God:      I blew it.  I screwed things up by failing to the meet the standards of my supervisor.  I also know that had lots of pain in doing the work as I had thorns sticking in my heart while I did the work.  I also ask for your forgiveness for not meeting her standards because you placed her in my life to learn lessons, and I simply messed things up.  My desire for full-time work unless you do something great is gone because I upset too many people with my deeds because I failed to realize in the mist of my own condition that there are many people like me who hurt.  I failed to appreciate something you allowed by taking it for granted or even worrying about getting to the next level.  I also admit that job seeking and trying to hold on to a job are difficult burdens to carry.  Without you, I can not do this.  I know you forgave me, and the next days to come I have to depend on y our grace because I have no options remaining.  I have no strength, no smarts, no wit, no clever words to get out of this dark spot I reside.    I know you allowed me to have 30 days until March 31st as time to prepare for the work ahead.  I think I finally understand why why why you need to be lead by the spirit- the principal of listening, obeying, changing is a slow transition.  I admit that I let my emotions overwhelm me to the point that I damaged something you could use.  I know from Romans 8:28 you can use bad circumstances to build our character.  I also realize from this example that I consumed myself with materialism as I tried like crazy to take care of my needs as a responsible person.  I grew up with the notion that you are the master of your own destiny, and you showed me differently.  I ask that you will provide financially because the promise of your word stands true, and I ask you to forgive me of my sins.      I blew it...has anyone ever made mistakes?  I will give 10 points to the best opinion to this question.

The reason Im asking is b/c I was hired as a part timer. But before I could start I was to go through 4 weeks of training FULL TIME well in my 3rd week of training I was already working.      I work 2 12 hr shifts on the weekend. 31 or less hrs is considered part time at my job. So I started last week and then my boss said we should talk this week so I can choose another day to come in so that I can make 32 hrs and get my benefits.      Frankly I dont care for benefits as I am still under my parents b/c I'm a college student. I don't want to go to work tomorrow b/c Im a cust. service rep taking calls. I suck at the calls :-( I hate it! and they monitor us so it makes me even more nervous.      So I emailed her regarding this...mind you she dint call or email me though she said we should speak. I asked her if I was to continue working the weekend shift that I started the week before. And if I was to come in this week, pref friday (tomorrow) she never responded...

20090226215844AA0BLoq	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is this the problem with the housing market?	Back in the 50's or so the American dream was to have a house with a lawn in the suburbs, but at that time it meant a house that was maybe 1000 square feet, give or take (smaller for lower income families). Nowadays, the size has probably doubled or tripled while family sizes are only getting smaller.    I live in 500 sq. ft. portion of my in-laws house because there's no way we could afford the modern "American dream" but I would be perfectly happy in the 1950's version of the American dream but unfortunately there are NO houses like that available - they just don't even make them that small anymore.   Could this be the problem with the housing market? Three families could be living in the same lot that no one is living in right now because no one can afford it!

Is it time I start looking for a new one? Being the fact that she is a friend of a family member should I let it go and hope all works out? Is she doing exactly what other realtors would do?

Ok, now I am about to receive some money from a foreign country, probably from the United States. I am going to receive the amount by a cheque. So my question is are you people aware of :      (1) Any banks in India that would accept an international cheque which is drawn in Dollars ?      (2) Will such banks encash the cheque and get the cash converted from Dollars to Indian Rupees and deposit it in my account ?      That's all I want to know. And guys, please do not suggest any alternative modes of money transfer. For me only cheques are a viable and the only possible option. So please help me out. Your valuable suggestion matters.

20090226203854AAFfgYi	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Need Real Estate Agent/Broker Advise.... Please!!!?	Okay, The thing is I am getting ready to start looking for a house to buy with my girlfriend. My parents want to go business partners with me on the investment to help get me into my first home. So they are willing to pay the 20% down payment. They want only me on the title though, so that I can get that first time buyer benefit. With that being said. There are a couple of things that im afraid may affect me when it comes time to get pre-approved. One is that I cosigned for my girlfriends car, which will show up on my credit report, and work against me as far as debt ratio goes. How do I prove them otherwise that it's not my car payment, and that she pays it, and not writing checks, but online or over the phone? Second she will be helping me with the mortgage, how do I use her income to add in with mine if I'm going to be the only one on the title? (just a side note, we intend on getting married and moving out of state in a few years. And would like to use her first time buyer privelage on the next house, so she is okay with me just being on the title for this one, lol). Third I have a timeshare that I purchased last year like a dumbass. Now I'm stuck with it. Do I have to claim it? will it show up on my credit report? A year ago I could probabley do both mortgages, but now....eh I think I can only pay one mortgage and I'd rather it be my own home. So if I do have to claim it should I just pay it up until I get my home, and then from there stop paying? I know it will hurt my credit, but I will already have my home and I have a fairly new car I just got a year ago, so I think I'm okay. And last what are the steps to house buying? Do I look at homes first or go get pre-approved first? Do I have to go into a real estate office to get pre approved? Do I have to get prequalified first? What do I need to take with me to the office? Help!!!!

There is a leak in the garage but we didn't notice it until 2 weeks before we had to vacate.

As I began packing up my things in the garage I noticed everything was damaged from mold. I still didn't make a big thing about it and throw everything in the trash. The landlord sold her condo and they the buyer had an inspector come out to inspect the place. There was a long list of things that needed to fixed, one of which is the leak in the garage. So the landlord called HOA and they said they will not fix the leak because the tenant didn't notify us. So my question is can she sue us for this? We live in california.

She said that the company would pay for 60% of my pay and I would have to use about 3 hours a day of my paid time off with the bank.  She said I would get a check directly from the disability company.  So, does that mean that I would receive 60% of my pay from this company and the remaining from my employer?  Would that mean that instead of using 40 hours of my PTO i would only be using 15?  I don't understand how it works and would like some clarification please!

Dealer Z paid Middle Man in advance for products from Manufacturer A, which went on Middle Man's account.  Since Dealer Z paid already, Middle Man had the order shipped directly to Dealer Z.      * Problem:  Dealer Z went over Middle Man's head by calling Manufacturer A to change the ship method.  Manufacturer A changed it without asking Middle Man.  Middle Man charged Dealer Z for 3-Day shipping (not the Next Day it was changed to)...  Middle Man must now charge Dealer Z for the balance.      * The ultimate questions:  How does Middle Man tactfully tell Manufacturer A they screwed up, without putting Manufacturer A on the defensive?  (They should've asked first.)...  How does Middle Man politely tell Dealer Z they'll never order through Middle Man's account again, without losing Dealer Z's business?  (Dealer Z has a history of questionable behavior.)

20090428130412AAHea2z	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	Why is medical education (to be a physician) so unbelievably long here in the United States?	I'm a 20 year-old college student whose parents once wanted him to be a doctor, but who flatly refused.      It wasn't because of finances or anything (I'm on a full-merit scholarship now, and wouldn't have an issue paying for any medical school), but the thing is it's SO LONG!      People that I know that live in Russia or in other countries can practice medicine in just three to four years, without going to undergraduate, and they have the same quality of treatment as US physicians.      But here in the US, it's 4 years of undergrad, 4 years of Medical School, THEN 3+ years of residency. (Not to mention the myriad of tests and licensing exams in between!)      So why is becoming a doctor so long here in the United States?      I calculated it out, and I wouldn't even start working full time as a doctor until I were 28! And to think of all the debts I'd accrue by then!

20090225143100AApGBdZ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Options other than foreclosure?	We bought our home in 2007, and since then the property value has fallen to lower than what we owe on it. I'm guessing somewhere around $15-20k lower. My husband received a pay cut, and I am on unpaid maternity leave until April. I have tried to get a night job, but no one is hiring. We have been able to make our $1600 mortgage payment since December. I have tried to work with our lender to lower our payments, but they say there is nothing they can do aside foreclosure, unless we sell the house. They offered a repayment plan, but the payments are higher than the existing monthly payments. We can't borrow money from anyone, or take out any kind of loan. Do we have any options other than foreclosure, like selling the property back to the bank, or? What are the odds of them forgiving the remaining balance in that situation?

If the government asked everyone who does not NEED their jobs (2 income households, people who work for 'something to do' etc) to quit for a while and let the people who are desperate for jobs to have their positions until the economy evens out.   A family with 1 income is in a much better situation than a family with no income who is loosing their house. So many families choose to have 2 incomes just to have a fancier car, house, nicer clothes..... not because they are trying to feed their kids and keep a roof over their heads. If a family can make it on 1 income for a while - why not let another family have the job for a while???

My dad got sick about six months ago both of his kidneys stopped working and now he’s on dialysis we are making less money we are struggling making our payments we can’t afford to make our payments anymore it’s becoming very stressful to our family and we’re better off renting if we don’t get serious help to save our house! I talked to 20 loan modifications companies and they are charging anywhere from $1400 to $4000 and telling me all different kind of stories. I did the math and I have a very good knowledge of mortgages unless they lower my principal balance reduced to fair market value at a good rate paying Principal and interest that would be the only way to lower my monthly payment since I’m already at an interest only loan! A good advice please? I understand mortgages and loan modification but I need an advice in who should I go with or should I trust and how should I go about it. thank you very much!!!

Due to the economy, we have been a bit slow in paying our mortgage.  We were paying the full amount every month, but usually a bit late.  Because our payment did not include the late payment fee, they are holding our money and not crediting it to our account.  They are saying we are 3 months behind even though they have all of our money, minus the late fees and 1 month's payment (we are truly only 1 month behind).  They are talking foreclosure now and will not accept any money from us unless it is for the total amount due.  Why will they not credit our account with all of the money we have sent them?        Any advice on what to do to keep our house and to get the mortgage company to credit our account for the thousands of dollars they are holding onto?

My mom is left to cover all these bills, plus his house payments, and her own payments, and now my ill grandma (and she only makes $30,000 a year)         In no way can we afford this, is there anyway around it?? ( I know that when we sent a death certificate to the Ambulance that took my dad to the hospital, they covered the bill....but my grandma is still alive)

20090225124212AAJZQRo	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Need Advise On Moving! Important!!!?	Right......    We rent out house at the moment,    and have been living here for almost 13 months now.    Then at the beginning of this year we were told we had to renew our agreement. We were not aware that when we renewed this one that it would become a fixed term agreement.   We have been really hoping to move house so started looking into it. We went to ask our letting agent know about this and said that we had found a property with another letting agent, they said we could not do this as our new agreement means that we cannot move out of our property unless we pay to put it back on the market, and then we have to wait untill someone wants to move in before we can move out.       We were very confused as we were not aware that this would of been the case, we thought we could just give notice and move out.    Our letting agents have been very very rude and not very nice at all about this, and wouldnt even explain to us why.       We could of taken the risk of saying we will wait for our property to go, but then we might not have anywhere to live!  and with a child you just cant take the risk.      the property that we wanted is just down the road, we are paying 590 a month for a tiny 2 bed with one bath room, when we could get a huge 3 bed with 2 bathrooms and a huge garden just down the road for 40 pound more a month.       can ANYONE help us give us any suggestions. we feel so trapped and poorly treated. :(

20090225124212AAqSbGg	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	What does it mean to attach a bank account?	I owe approx 25k on an unsecured loan. I am unable to pay the minimum payment. I have offered the company a smaller minimum payment but the company states that's unacceptable. Due to a financial hardship/emergency (loss of a job due to job closing), my husband and I can't pay the amount that they want.      Now, we're unable to pay the minimum. We know with this amount of debt, they will send us to court eventually. In our state, there is no wage garnishment. However, we're concerned about them attaching a bank account and what the entails.       If we were to go to court, could we negotiate a payment? Right now, they will not negotiate. They offered a settlement payment, but they wanted like 4 installments of 1000+ dollars. We can't pay the minimum so of course we can't pay that. We're current on all of our other bills.       So...my questions:   *What does it mean to "Attach a bank account"?   *Can a negotiation be made eventually/settlement for lesser payment amount and/or debt amount?   *Is there any hope?

The new policy will force US manufacturers to "retool" to make more efficient, more expensive, less reliable, smaller cars.  The big 3 will be given new, highly automated factories (needing fewer employees) courtesy of the American tax payers.  The factories will be much smaller and more environmentally friendly since they won't be making nearly as many cars because we won't be able to afford them.      Once the democratic socialist government controls the auto industry it will greatly simplify car shopping.  You'll take what they give you and like it... or they send you to Siberia, Comrade!    http://www.dsausa.org/dsa.html

Still they have not repaired problems that are their obligation under the terms of the lease.  Now they are renigging on their agreement to pay for the fire alarm system and expect me to pay $5000.  Instead, they are asking that I pay up front and they will reimburse me.  The chance of that happening are about 1:1,000,000.        I am at the point where I am losing business because they will not make the necessary repairs, including having a functioning sewer system.        If I sue, how much will it cost me to sue them?

20090225123629AAXIUAs	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How do I dispute a low ball appraisal?	I just got a low refinance appraisal. 130K. I think my house is worth much more. I recently had it on the market and received a 147k offering in 1 month (in THIS market!!) and as I was looking for another house in the same price range I was selling mine for, I understood why my potential buyers were so adamant on buying my house. No other houses in the 140-150K price range had 2 bathrooms.  I remember only seeing two and they were old and raggedy with much work to be done.        My house is completely gutted and modernized; it has two bathrooms and a first floor master bedroom suite!  Moreover, the city assessment list my hoe as being a one story with 1 bathroom and much lower square footage- and I suspect the appraiser used the city records to determine my square footage.      I am really disappointed. This affects my whole purpose for refinancing. Is there anything I can do dispute this, i.e. use my own research to prove to the lender/appraiser that my house is worth more?
