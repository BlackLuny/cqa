I like wearing cute dresses (i have to wear a white-V-neck tee under them because of the school dress code), and I also like wearing stuff like T-shirt or my white V-Neck with a high waisted skirt on top. I wear lots of bows, ribbons, stuff like that (like clips or headbands in my hair and there will be bows to tie on my clothes, like around my waist?) I wear jeans too, usually just dark skinny jeans and then I have a lot of graphic Ts/V-necks. I also have a leopard print tank top i LOVE. lol. most of my jewelry are hearts, lol. Right now my favorite thing is a small golden heart from juicy that i got for christmas :P       What would you call my style? I have nooo idea. I'm a bit of a trendsetter... umm today I came up with kind of the pretty-sweetheart look, kind of inspired by the fourties, like pinup girls and such? But idk... :P what would u call me?

I have the hardest time finding bikinis to fit my chest. I wear a 36DD or DDD depending on the make/brand. Some department stores carry DD sizes but the suits are tacky and aged. I don't want a tankini or a one-piece. It seems like the only places you can find cute swimwear for busty girls is in the UK or Australia. You can buy them online but I'd rather try it on in the store since it would be an international order. It's so difficult finding suits that fit my bust. I'm not plus size either. Back when I wore a D-cup it was hard and now most brands make D-cup suits. Does anyone know of some American brands that make DD+ bikinis? Or stores that carry them. I'm running out of options and Spring Break is in 2 weeks. Please help me.

20090220185939AAkKpQ8	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Why do girls buy uggs when they kill sheep?	how come girls buy uggs which kill 2 sheep per pair      i don't get it         its sheepskin.....so they have to kill the sheep         The sheep has to be slaughted to obtain their hide and fleece. Now once the sheepskin hides are taken from the sheep then the process of preparing the hide for manufacturers and ensuring the hides are up to export standard begins.      Woolskins are usually preserved with salt prior to being processed by tanneries. At the tannery the skins are processed in large vessels called paddles which vary in capacity from 3000 to 15000 litres. In contrast to hide processing, in woolskin processing mechanical action is kept to a minimum in order to minimise felting of the wool. Rotating blades on the paddles move the skins slowly and gently, and processing is performed at much higher float ratios (typically 20-35 litres of water per skin) than are used in hide processing.      Typically it takes about 10 working days for the skins to be tanned and finished ready to be cut into panels for ugg boots

Not permanently, but I am interested to see how it would look, and to get a chance to really clean my scalp well.  I mean deep clean, get to the pores and just scrub off the dead skin.      Problem is, I am in school, I work two jobs where I must be in the public eye, and I am not sure how I would look bald.      I have very thick, somewhat long hair.  My eyebrows are thick, but I can get them waxed.  I have prominent cheekbones, but I also have bad skin (a little acne and a lot of blemishes).        What would be the worst outcome of me shaving my head?      Should I purchase a wig for work?  Would it look realistic on a completely bald head?      How should I go about shaving my head, and what are some tips to maintain my hair later?      Any additional suggestions would be greatly appreciated.      Thanks!

I've been buying my own wefts of hair extensions and gluing them in myself for a couple of years now, but because they get loose every couple of weeks I take them out and re-do them. Because of this, there ends up being a huge buildup of glue on the top of the weft and they don't stick in as strongly. Does anyone know how I can remove the glue? I can't pick it off as I've tried before and it only pulls off in little tiny tiny bits and it would be impossible to do it all.

As much as I'd love to do something with it, I can't; My parents don't approve of any of the haircuts I have in mind. I just wanted a little shag here and there and make it like V-like, if you know what I mean. I don't know how what they call it. Maybe some layers. That's as far rugged as I can go. Bangs are not an option. I wish I could have them, but my parents (again) do not approve. They think It'll make me itch.      My face shape is oval, and I'm fourteen. What can I do? Is there I way I can get a decent haircut that would pass as 20th-century-ish AND get my parents' approval?

But the generalization is that long, big dresses usually don't do short people much good. The dress my mom got me is currently at the store on hold until I make a final decision. So, what do you think?      Short or long dress in my case?

20090219125720AAPbTgM	Beauty & Style;Hair	How to get natural, soft curly hair?	I like loose ringlets.   Is there any way to make my hair like that without curling it or a perm? And no gel either?   Like when I get out of the shower, I use mousse and scrunch my hair, and its really pretty, but then it sort of falls limp and goes poofy when it dries...   I don't like using that much hairspray, and I've been using my straightner less so my hair won't be that damaged and poofy because I used to straighten it everyday.      Also, my scalp gets really itchy FAST, so I got a tip from someone that says rinse your hair with cold water after you condition and shampoo it, and it makes it shiny when it dries, and softer and makes your hair follicle seal close, so no polution gets in it.      It's been working good so far, and it's not that itchy anymore, but everytime my wind blows in the wind, my hair gets dirty...      Is there any way to get the curls, keep my hair clean and reduce the poofiness?
