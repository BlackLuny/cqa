I was just thinking of the case where that teenager hung herself b/c of the bogus Myspace messages.  To extend that senerio, if a Yahoo (or any other public forum similar to this one) questioner asks a question and receives an answer that is unfavorable (mean or something they didn't want to hear) and harms themselves, should the answerer be held accountable?  Do you think prosecuters could even try to go after an answerer, or are they protected b/c this is a public forum?        What if the answerer was one of the habitual mean ones that we run across on this site so often?

My dad ate the first cupcake then the next day revealed the cupcakes location to me and my brother while giving each of us one (they were hidden). The pop-tart where always in plain sight and every was allowed one each day. Anyway last night the remaining three cupcakes where found missing but the plastic packaging was left behind. This morning there was 3 pop-tarts left but when I got home to get my daily pop-tart they were gone, and like the cupcakes the pop-tart box was left behind.       Possible Culprits:   Brother - Reason that it wouldn't work: I don't have any   Sister - Reason that it wouldn't work: Can't reach pop-tarts without parental help and didn't know about cupcakes   Mom - Reason it wouldn't work: She's trying to figure out who did it   Dad - Reason it wouldn't work: Same as mom

20090128201838AAvcHii	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	How is this in VIOLATION?	Could someone please tell me what/which parts of this comment were in violation of the guidelines?  I read them, but they seem kind of vague and based on them, at least half of the answers I see on Y!A would seem to be in some sort of "violation".  Thanks.      "Vitamin C.....those were probably the worst examples you could    have chosen. The first of your quotes contains nothing misogynistic and your second citation merely tells the story of God's response to    Eve's initiation of sin into the world. Whether you believe the    story or not, one must admit that, within its own context, the judgment    seems justified. The verses in the New Testament would've served    your purpose far better."
