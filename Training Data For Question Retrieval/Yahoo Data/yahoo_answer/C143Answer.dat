jcXSNjowaa	around march 2nd|`|rstJrY3jaa	Go look at a few different tests. Some say that they can detect a pregnancy up to 5 days before your missed period.<br>  <br>  So, 5 days before your period would normally start.<br>  <br>  Also, they can be more accurate if you use the test in the morning the first time you urinate, as since your bladder's been filling all night then that will probably contain more of the pregnancy hormone that the test uses to tell you if you are pregnant.|`|F3BRG72iaa	well you have to wait until you pass your period again for more accuracy|`|mK1GcbJ2aa	next period|`|b7329aa7a50c45d2073625da82916595aa	At the earliest 5 days before your first missed period, however that is only works for about 35% of women, for the most accurate result you should wait until the first day of your missed period.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	Take it the day your period is supposed to be begin, or you can take it about 5 days before, if you use first response.|`|OU9xnW86aa	2 weeks after having unprotected sex or about 5 days (maximum) before your next period is due.
Ul5NFGNkaa	There is a 'Health in Pregnancy' payment of around ￡190. You don't get it until you are 5 months pregnant and your midwife needs to fill in the form. But ￡190 won't stretch far when you are buying stuff for baby.<br>  <br>  Perhaps save as much as you can while you are still working and this will help you when you are on maternity leave.|`|3AXlgGgUaa	There is no grant or anything... it is a choice to have a baby and a choice to have maternity leave.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford to have the full maternity leave, you don't have to take it.<br>  <br>  Many women have a couple of week and then go back to work...<br>  <br>  Maybe another option would be to talk to your employer and instead of full maternity leave - how about part-time hours for the duration instead?<br>  <br>  Work out the minimum hours per week you would need to do to be financially secure, taking into consideration the fact you will not get maternity pay and will have to pay for a baby sitter and then go and speak to your boss.<br>  <br>  The only way would be a loan... and debt isn't a smart choice atm.
xXnFx6qLaa	You go through the motions.<br>  <br>  First I was sad - like you are right now.  Then, I got angry, REAL angry at him.  Then, I got sad again, because I thought my son was missing out.  And then guess what - I realized that no one is missing out on anything except his father.  And that's his loss, not anyone else's.  <br>  <br>  Your son is SO loved.  You know that.  I'm sure he's going to have so many positive male influences in his life that he won't even miss out on a person who doesn't want to be there anyways.<br>  <br>  Just lean on your friends and family for support.  I'm here if you need to talk.  :)|`|dLadxEJSaa	I have to disagree with the first poster.<br>  <br>  You don't need to find him a daddy because he has a wonderful Mommy who loves him so much. You will love and care for him enough for the both of you and he will grow up knowing that.<br>  <br>  Be angry, be sad...but then realize how truly blessed you are to have that miracle in your life.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Find strength in you.  Be the best mother that you can be to your son.  Stand up and be a strong and independent, loving and caring single mother.  When the time is right the right man will come into your life.  One who will be a real man for you and your son, instead of the coward that is his biological father.  When you stop feeling sorry for your baby and being upset with his father and start to realize and accept the fact that he is out of the picture and this is a blessing, you will start to feel better.  Think about what kind of man you really want to put infront of your son as an example.  And realize that is not his biological father.  And then be thankful that you have the opportunity to find that type of man for your son instead of having that loser be the one that teaches your son.  You don't want your son growing up like that. <br>  <br>  Everything will be fine.  Wipe your tears.  Hold your head up.  And smile.  Smile for the beautiful baby that you have.  And be thankful for the opportunity to provide him with a better life.|`|giRRCXU4aa	I'm in the same spot. I worry everyday about having to tell my son one day about his father. I wonder how I will handle it and what I will say. My son's father said the same thing to me, he acted the same way. The good news is that we have very supportive families and our sons will be loved either way. We are here for them and they will love us for that. It makes me feel better to hear things like this from other people in my situation. You will do great! Jamie is beautiful. Congratulations.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I heard some great words of encouragement on the movie "Changling":<br>  <br>  The little boy asks his mom where is dad is and she replies, "The day you arrived a package arrived as well. Now this package was just a little bigger then you. When you dad unwrapped that package he found it contained "responsibility". Well, your daddy wasn't ready to accept that package. But, I was!"<br>  <br>  *I didn't quote it perfectly, but that was the point of it!|`|aD8Xmhdiaa	i'm sure there will be some point in his life that he will wonder what it's like to have a father, but don't let that bother you. plenty of kids are raised with one parent, but they are used to it and that's what they consider a family. you're gonna do great, and there's still a high chance that you will finda great guy to love both of ya'll.|`|cteyFJxhaa	You say....your father wasn't ready to be a dad when you came along but maybe you can find him when you grow up if you want to.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't bash the dad...he will resent you for it.  Besides you make yourself look stupid because you slept with him.<br>  <br>  Try not to stress about it too much.  He's the one missing out.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|e4aF8tdPaa	he is being an a hole and needs to grow up. just do right by your son and everything will fall into place. its his loss and once he realizes it then it will be too late. and don't feel bad when you look at Jamie he is the best thing that has ever happened to you.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	as long as your baby has you, that's all that matters!! Forget the dad, he doesn't sound like he deserves to be in your son's life. Be proud mama, you have a beautiful little boy now!|`|DNygQdmVaa	Im 19 years old and my dad was never in my life.<br>  <br>  It doesn matter to me at all, I had a good life despite him.<br>  <br>  And Im sure your son will feel the same way.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	im in an emotionally crappy situation myself....with the help of antidepressants and therepy and taking it 1 day at a time,has helped some.....you will meet someone someday that will love both of you so incredibly much,and someone who wants to be a father to jamie....will love and care for him like he was his....jamie wont know that his real dad is not there,because he hasnt been there,so he doesnt know him to miss or want him.....its the "real"fathers loss.....any man can be a father but it takes someone special to be a dad.....youll see and so will little jamie...........|`|q1Swxe3qaa	You can definately find a better daddy for that baby!! If that man doesn't want to be involved, then you can't force him! He would be a worthless father if you have to force him. Find someone that loves you and loves your baby! Thats what I did! :) My boyfriend treats my daughter just like his own, she even calls him daddy! :)  It will be okay i promise! Just keep looking at that beautiful son of yours and know that things will get better! He doesn't have to know all of that baggage!  I was sooo depressed for awhile too, but life starts to look up after awhile! I promise!|`|X0ubZnPjaa	i would always try my hardest for the father to be in my sons life but if they make the decision that they cant be bothered then so be it! they are the ones missing out. eventually your child's gonna grow up is gonna ask their dad " why wasn't you there?" and he is gonna have to explain that to them. <br>  <br>  i soon came to realise that i could bring my kids up better by myself anyway.|`|F3BRG72iaa	well being a single parent is really difficult, but would you rather have an uncaring father for your son or just try to make him happy and later someone who really cares can come along and make you both happy.  Congratulations on your new baby and wish you two the best in life.|`|yjbJOk0Iaa	Forget his dad. Raise your kid so that he does not turn out to be like his dad.<br>  <br>  Its his dad's loss. If a man cannot take care of his own child and asks the women to get an abortion he is the worst kind to spend your tears and time on....you are good without him.|`|73808e403987212ba673162fcda0802daa	It wasn't too similar in the fact that I wasn't pregnant in the end but about 3 months ago, I thought I was having a miscarriage, I talked to my bf at the time to see if he could call my sister for me (she went through one as well as his mother) and he just told me he wasn't calling them and that I should get over it. I was curled up in pain and possibly going through something big and all he did was tell me that. It hurt so much. I know its not the same but I understand how you feel when you say he has the right to treat you like that but not your son. You don't even deserve it. I'm so sorry. He's a rotten person and I hope karma finds him in the end!!!<br>  <br>  I basically let time deal with it. Also I relied on my friends to be there for me alot and although we aren't dating, a new guy has been there for me more than the ex ever was. I really hope things get better with time for you too!!|`|AA10054750	Be encouraged. There are plenty of good men still out there that will love you and your son. I am a single mother of 3. The last 2 are a set of twins. Their father and I broke up when I was 8 months pregnant. The day I had them, my blood pressure wouldnt go down and I was really sick...he went to put a stroller together with one of his friends instead...he thinks I should have had an abortion..but oh well, I did it with 3 and you can too. Now we have a MAN in our lives that loves all 4 of us unconditionally. Your son will know LOVE just by being in your presence. It wont even matter that his sperm donor wasnt around. Be strong!!!|`|TQW5E6olaa	I also have to comment on the first poster. You do NOT need to rush out and find him a daddy. That would actually be a bad idea. There is so much love surrounding Jamie, it doesn't matter that his father isn't in his life right now. And you shouldn't feel that you need to provide one either.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel. It used to make me sad to think how Bella's dad just didn't care. He'd come play with her now and then but that was it. That wasn't a father figure. Then I got angry (like Jonhnny's mom said, you can go back and forth between those emotions) Angry that she wasn't important enough to him. Angry that he didn't care enough to be around regularly or help out with her. For the most part 20 months later, I'm indifferent. There are occasional moments where he should be there for her and it makes me sad, but it never lasts longer than a minute or two.<br>  <br>  You have a loving supportive family, and any male figure in his life can be a positive role model, it doesn't have to be the sperm donor, it can be an uncle, paw paw, etc. He's a loser and a jerk, so Jamie is actually benefiting by not having him around. Try to think of it that way, that he wouldn't be a good father even if he was around, so it's better for everyone that he isn't. You're still only like 2 weeks out from giving birth, you've still got all those hormones going haywire, give it some time, it will get easier, I promise!<br>  <br>  If you ever want to vent, you know you can email me :)|`|VHHis05Naa	My nephew is in the same situation as your son.  He sometimes asks about his bio dad and knows that it was his bio dad's choice not to be in his life, but he's a well-adjusted, happy kid.  My sister gives him a good life and he knows how important he is to her and that he is loved.<br>  <br>  His bio dad has met him once in his life when he was a few days old.  My sister got through that hard time with family support and keeping the focus on her son.  I'm sorry your son's bio father is such a jerk.  He is the one missing out.
cAtWxJG1aa	nope.  one of the few unquestionably perfect decisions i ever made.|`|H74F8jxuaa	I wouldn't trade my husband for the world, but there are a few people that I would trade a spouse for someone else because they aren't good parents.  For example, my brother in law drinks until he passes out every single night and now his teenage son is violent and a little brat because daddy lets him get by with it and he hits my sister (who is the step mom).  I don't like my brother in law, but my sister wants to stay married to him for the kids.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I wish I had a different father for my child. We were together for 4 years when we had our son (married) and his true colors came out and I didn't even know who he was at that point and it's just gone down hill from there.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Not me.  I wouldn't have married him if that was the case.  And it's impossible to keep the same kids without the same mom/dad.  Without the exact same parents you would have different children.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I'm incredibly happy with the father of my child. I think I made an excellent choice in picking him.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I would absolutely change my daughter's father, I was a teenager and it was an oops! pregnancy, he's worthless. He does drugs and just got a OWI, he lives with his parents and he might show up to see her every three months (they live 8 miles away) he complains about how I spend my child support (he thinks I should take her out every month and let her spent $350... she's 6!) I know eventually she'll realize what he is and I worry about that! I wouldn't change my husband as a father for my son for anything|`|XOtOMncwaa	I wouldn't, sometimes I would like to trade certain qualities that my fiancee has, but I would never trade him. He's truly a great man and I'm so thankful to have had a child with him. If I would have had a child with a lot of the other men I have dated neither me or my child would stand a chance!|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	I dont care for my ex but I know my kids would not be who they are if it wasnt for the parents they have. You cant change parents and have the same kid so I am happy with what I have|`|prqrQcd1aa	Sadly, yes I would. The man I am with now would be their father.. he already is in a sense, but he is not their biological father.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Nope. I love my husband and wouldn't trade him.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I would be willing to trade kids though.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Not me!!!<br>  <br>  I look back at all of the losers I dated prior to meeting my husband and thank my lucky stars.  I remember telling my friends, "I think I'm in love with a nerd" when I met him.  LOL!  He is faaaaar from a nerd and, best of all, he is the best possible father for my children.  I am the lucky one.
EtCRnDJMaa	Yes & No<br>  <br>  If the parent is really trying to be there for their teen and is making rules, but all the teen wants to do is break them by not coming home stay out all night, or whatever, how would it be the parents fault?<br>  <br>  If the parents don't care or at work all the time or not coming home themselves then yes, they should be held  responsible for their teens actions.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes a parent cannot do anything for their teen even though they have tried.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's your responsibility to say NO to sex, not your moms!  You have to be the one with self control & self despline.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	As long at they are underage and living at home and having their bills paid and needs met by the parents doing then YES that child is under the parents rules and therefore the parents responsibility- just as if they were still younger.<br>  I would like to think that most parents teach their kids what is and is not acceptable in terms of values and behavior so that they don't have major trouble on their hands. Unfortunately some parents check out mentally when their kids become teenagers and give up. That's when problems start.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	If the parent is making attempts to get their teenager help, then no, they shouldn't be held responsible.  Whether it is their child or not, they are still people and if they have the will and power then they can techniqually do whatever they want.  There parents don't need to allow, or disapprove of this behavior.  However, if the parent doesn't care what their teen is doing or if they just stand idly by while their child wreaks havoc, then yes, they should be held responsible.|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	Yes and no. Yes because they raise they take care of their children plays a part in the child's judgements later in life. No because  teenager is  teenager. They know what they are doing is out of control if they are doing it. They make up their own minds and a parents' teachings can only affect a teens' judgments so far.|`|ftvxAS3saa	NO.. ITS NOT THERE FAULT. SOME TIMES A PARENT CANT CONTROL THERE CHILD,  I KNOW MY MOTHER COULDNT CONTROL ME. I WAS SO BAD AN I ALWAYS DID SOMETHING TO GET OUT OF GROUNDATION OR SOMETHING I NEVER LISTENED AN I DONT REGRET ANYTHING|`|yjbJOk0Iaa	Yes...teens are children..and children will follow what their parents teach them. <br>  <br>  When teens are not disciplined...only the parents are to blame for...|`|1enIWBGnaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  If a parent refuses to 'straighten up' a child, by the time they are 2 - then they must be responsible for their 'out of control teen'.<br>  It is a parents job to discipline and guide a child until he/she reaches 18.<br>  We have a neighboring small town that passed a law stating parents are responsible for anything (law breaking) their teen does.  I've seen them force the parents to show up in court, pay the fines and for any and all damage done by their teen.  At first, the parents complained, saying; "I didn't do the damage, my kid did.  I will make him get a job and pay for everything".  The judge replied "we have a law - YOU are responsible and therefore, you will pay for everything.  If you would have raised your teen properly - then you would not be standing before me now".|`|F3BRG72iaa	well even though parents do take a role in how teens are raised they do have a bit of responsibility for an out of control teen.  They should really put a stop to eat by not being so lenient on them. Also teens themselves are responsible to because of how they can take peer pressure and what kind of friends they have.|`|rzLGCrlfaa	yes if the parent doesn't want to watch their kids and they would rather go out and have a good time they shouldn't have had a kid if they live in section 8 or public housing you shouldn't have a kid and if you can't be there emotionally than you shouldn't have a kid|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	yes. I am a parent and I beleive you are responsible for them as long as they are underage. If my kids act up they get punished. I agree fully|`|ij5ivVUWaa	YEA! I wish My mom was with me one night and controlled me. Because now i have a child!|`|Mm5NsrF8aa	as long as they are under age and living under your roof, yes

4eTyCuRSaa	Heck it stir resentment in me just reading this question.  Why would the punishment be any different between you children based upon gender.<br>  <br>  Do you not believe that your sons feel pain as much as your daughters?<br>  <br>  Whether you are a believer in spanking or not what ever the consequence for misbehaving need to be served without regard as to gender.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Does it cause resentment in sons when they get spanked by dad?<br>  <br>  Does it call resentment in daughters when they get spanked by mom?<br>  <br>  As long as the spanking is "fair", I can't wee any real reason for esentment by sons or by daughters. Though I suspect daughters might feel more resentment; sons likely just "get it and get over it" better.<br>  .<br>  As long as they know parental love and affection 24/7/365<br>  .|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	seems perfectly logical to me that he might be resentful of such unbalanced discipline, although if the son's transgressions are much worse than the daughter, and hers don't merit a spanking, then in all reality the treatment is fair....|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Yes, all children should be treated equally. But in my opinion, no child should be spanked.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	yes, <br>  all children should be treated equally.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	yes i am not for spanking but i think that all children should have the same rules and consequences x|`|1mJIbY0uaa	All inequalities between children's treatment can cause resentment.<br>   <br>  I was raised in an old fashioned family where both some of the rules and consequences were different regarding to our gender. That was because father was the main disciplinarian for boys and mom for sisters. We were raised similarly until we became about 9 or 10, but then it always changed:<br>  <br>  Sisters got a bit stricter rules for curfews and they usually lost their privileges for longer time while me and my brother got more freedom. Me and my big brother though were punished with more traditional way by dad. My older brother more often than me. maybe parents grew softer and wiser. <br>  <br>  Now my sisters feel resented because they feel that spankings would have left them out quicker and they envied their brothers freedom (our spankings were not really bad beatings). I though remember the embarrassment of few occasions when I had to follow dad to my room or somewhere secluded while sisters knew well that it would result to a sore butt. Well, at least I got over my punishment quicker:(|`|Hs3HjbMbaa	yes, girls can be just as bad if not worse, spank them as well, before they grow up to be brats who think they can get away with murder, and their poor brothers can't- <br>  <br>  Not to mention that'll teach the girls to be mean to their brothers so they will get their butts busted- girls can be such cruel b****** <br>  from witnessing experience...|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	yes my mother in law punishes my neices but acts like my nephew can do no wrong (the other way around from what you said but same thing).  You can definitly see that the girls feel unloved and upset bc of it.|`|1j7QLM7Saa	Yes you should be even to all your children, and being unfair and uneven at a young age will make them start resenting you as a parents|`|R4dcGCVDaa	Yes, because that is showing partiality. This can provoke rebellion in sons.|`|DfKdzD46aa	you are encouraging sexism in your home, and yes it could cause resentmentt
23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	My youngest was a late walker ..  It probably had something to do with her feet rarely touching the ground as the older two (they are 10 and 8 years older) carried her everywhere..  <br>  <br>  I spent countless hours saying "Put her down", "You don't need to carry her." and "She can get there on her own."|`|AA11482488	My youngest (who is now 25) didn't walk till he was 18 months.  The main reason was that we lived in a tiny apartment and it was winter, he could get around just fine without walking.  Once it got warm and the other kids went outside, he couldn't keep up.  He was walking in no time.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	my older son walked at 15 months, my daughter walked at 10.5 months and my youngest walked at a few days past a year old.|`|RgNUsKfxaa	yip my son didnt walk untill he was 18 mths my daughter walked on her 1st b/day|`|gB86RtjIaa	Yes both my kids walked at 14 months.  Now they are 10 and 5 and very mobile.|`|VHHis05Naa	My daughter walked very early, but my husband didn't walk until past 14 months.  I can assure you that he's fine.  :)  As long as they eventually get it, don't stress!  Once they do start walking it's nothing but trouble.|`|1OpcR7bZaa	I  only started to walk when i was 2 or 3 years old.
vOomJtbsaa	LOL I would have but my fiance was out of town for work the week I was due so I sat on my butt hoping that I would be overdue because the idea of going through labor without him was horrid!  Thankfully I went into labor 3 days after he came home..... good timing eh?! :) :)|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I tried acupuncture, spicy foods, lots of sex, orgasm, walking, more walking, I was too scared to use black cohosh as I didn't want fetal decelerations to occur, and evening primrose oil.   When the midwife told me to use the evening primrose oil vaginally and place the caplets near my cervix I tried that and I was delivered within 48 hours.   I don't know if that is what worked or if it was just time, but with that pregnancy I went to 41 weeks 4-5 days, I can't remember really, but it was more then half way through the last week and I was staring down another c-section.   I really don't recommend trying to break your water though, it didn't help me at all and I was not looking for it, that premature rupture of the membranes (before labor) meant a long induction with a c-section at the end.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I credit drinking raspberry leaf tea while eating sex in the pan...DH was disappointed he didn't get to try real sex, lol.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	i heard walking a lot works but idk|`|u0mZAPuDaa	I tried castor oil at 37 weeks and two days, didn't try anything else.<br>  <br>  I drank three tablespoons in a glass of grape juice at 10:30pm, at 1:30am I woke up with contractions and my water had broke. I had our daughter at 7:47pm that day!<br>  <br>  I talked to me obstetrician about this before doing it because you always see and hear women jumping to saying 'No' real quick; I wondered why.  He said that women just aren't as educated about castor oil. (It's kind of like those high fructose corn syrup commercials)<br>  <br>  He said it is a natural laxative that is safe to use with children. He said, as with any laxative there are the risks of diarrhea. He told me the common sense is to drink more fluids if you are losing fluids. He said it was completely safe and many mid wives still do it today!<br>  <br>  He said if the baby isn't completely ready to come out, it won't work. So, there aren't any risks involved. <br>  <br>  These women that say that you can get sick and vomit, yeah if you don't take it correctly. If you take too much at a time, as with anything, it can make you vomit. If you take it on an empty stomach, it can cause your stomach to be upset, just like eating too many sweets!<br>  <br>  It's common sense.<br>  <br>  It is completely natural and safe.<br>  <br>  :)|`|TCJQEUbXaa	I don't think there is anything you can do non medically to make a baby com early and even medical interventions don't truly work they just put you at a risk for more medical interventions.  Babies come when they are ready.  My first was 2 weeks overdue at the hospital, they did a membrane stripping with a PROM and I wound up waiting 24 hours for him to come, having to have in IV for open membranes over 12 hours.<br>  My second was a 1 week overdue homebirth.  I did some pelvic rocking to alleviate back pain and contractions came on 2 minutes apart - in 5 hours he was born.<br>  The best thing to do is remain healthy throughout your pregnancy, drink lots of water, exercise and eat right - leave the rest up to biology.<br>  read about my homebirth <a href="http://skyyogastudio.com" rel="nofollow">http://skyyogastudio.com</a>|`|08GDBedGaa	Hahahahaheee!! Oh you sure made me smile, :) i was 15 days over my due date, :( before i was induced by that oxytocin stuff!! i tried EVERYTHING, except the castor oil thing, eugghhh!! Raspberry leaf tea, in the gallons, nipple stimulation, pineapple, SEX< SEX "& more SEX, expensive acupuncture, acupressure massages, warm baths, walks, long, long walks, walking up and down stairs, general jumping and yoga poses, nada, nothing, even at hospital, after having my waters broke, then a pessary tablet(twice), the only thing was a bit intravenous shot of oxytocin, :) god, i've gone on a bit, :)|`|0uhRgfcsaa	oh goodness, im 6 days overdue and have tried EVERYTHING besides castor oil, and i'm still here =[.|`|iH2whFkHaa	lol! I tried<br>  <br>  walking<br>  squats<br>  castor oil<br>  enemas<br>  nipple stimulation<br>  spicy foods<br>  sex<br>  more sex<br>  <br>  Finally I just had the OB do a membrane sweep and I went into labor 2 days later; can't say if it was the sweep or not though.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Castor oil brought on contractions but I didn't go into labor until a few days after then I did go on come walks as well.
AA10494763	maybe not college but some sort of schooling after high school is very very important  like trade school (plumbing, carpenter etc)  or some sort of skill.  Long gone are the days that a high school diploma will get you a  comfortable life. There is very little you can do  now days  with a highschool diploma much less 18 years from now when my kids finsh highschool   They need some sort of training to help them get a job. I will help pay as much as a i can for school|`|cAtWxJG1aa	extremely.  i see it as equally necessary in this day and age as high school.  as for what kind of school ... whatever kind turns out to suit them best when they're that age, which isn't for a long while.  i will contribute as much as i can towards their education.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I think it's a good move, no matter what they decide to do in life.  It serves as a nice transition from dependence to independence, if nothing else.  It gives them a little time to safely try out their wings, learn how to live on their own, but still have a safety net to fall back into if needed.  <br>  <br>  If they decide not to go, that's OK, too.  <br>  <br>  I hope that, instead (or additionally), they go out travelling in the world for a while, too, before settling down into being adults.  <br>  <br>  I want them to go to whatever school best suits them & their goals.  My stepdaughter was being courted by Harvard, but decided on a local (but still private/non-state) college for a variety of reasons - but, largely because they have a great program in her major subject.  <br>  <br>  We will help them figure out how to pay for their educations.  For my stepdaughter, who's starting next fall, we've just figured out that between her scholarship and financial aid, she should be fine without our help.  Hope it goes as smoothly with the others!|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I want my kids to get education beyond the high school level.  It does not have to be college, but I would like them to learn a trade or skill, even the girls, even if her dream is to be a mommy and stay at home, we all need to be able to support ourselves.<br>  <br>  I went to college, it was expected of me.  I did not learn one single trade or skill, but rather went to a liberal arts college for four years.  They didn't have a very good career counseling center because most of their students were going on to graduate school.  I feel like I wasted a lot of time and my parents money now looking back.<br>  <br>  I will probably end up paying for their education.  This includes the stepson (who's 18 and trying to figure out what to do) and my two bio kids.  We have been trying to bribe the oldest, my stepdaughter who's 20. We offered to pay for her further education if she would get her high school diploma, but that hasn't happened yet.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	It is important.  It is what I want for them.  An education is something that will never not be useful.  in todays world, it is a most 99.9% of the time.<br>  don't really care about the school, as long as its an education.<br>  maybe, if i ever win the lottery sure, if not well thats what grants and scholarships are for.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	Extremely important to me that my kid go to college.  <br>  Of course I would hope for ivy league but not necessary.<br>  I will try my best to help with tuition, but having her to responsible for part of it could be a good motivation for her to work harder.|`|cZZUjVkqaa	It is very important to me that my children obtain a college education. I will strongly suggest a 4 year degree. Why? Because I firmly believe it is imperative to have a solid educational background to open up the most opportunities in life to help them succeed. They can chose to use their degree or not, I just want them to have it. I don't hope for a specific school, any will do as long as they are properly accredited and can offer the education my child is looking for/needs. I will pay for their education- I feel it is a parents responsibility.|`|wUooHVU3aa	When the time comes, I will support their decision to go or not to go. They might be happier entering an internship, military, starting a business or starting a family. It won't be my decision.<br>  <br>  The type of school isn't all that important, because a lot of people are earning on-line degrees.<br>  <br>  I will pay for their education to a certain point, but have no interest in supporting a "career student." Will help them locate grants and other assistance after a standard 4-yr degree.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Education is important to me and I would hope that he would choose to go to some type of college. I don't have any expectations on the type of school because I just want him to be happy with his choice. My reasoning is that I would want him to have a solid financial future. I know this is no guarantee though. <br>  <br>  With that being said, I would not be devastated if he chose not to go to college so long as he has goals for his life. I would hope that he would figure out what he wants to get out of life early on and pursue that.<br>  <br>  I have already started a college fund (grandparents have too.) He will not have to take out loans like my husband and I did. <br>  <br>  Interesting question.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	I don't have kids right know but i have a little sister that i love her like if she was my own daughter. for me it's very important for her to go to a college and get some kind of degree. i don't really care if she goes to a very fancy college or just to a community college as long she gets that extra paper showing that she is doing something ells in her life. I told her i will work for her till i die and money is no problem ill get 2 or even 3 jobs so she descent have to worry about the money.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Pretty important that its something more than just high school...<br>  <br>  I have an idea of how hard its going to be to finish now, but know that's the only way he'll have a better life (growing up), and as time goes on, it'll almost be impossible to get a well paying job with no degree.<br>  <br>  The kind doesn't matter. If he applies for Yale and is accepted, GREAT!! If he wants to go to a Jr then Sr college, great!! If he just wants to do auto mechanic degree, great! As long as he's happy with it.<br>  <br>  If I can pay, I'll help out. I've lucked out and have gotten by with Color Guard scholarship (and Daddy said my dancing would never pay for anything hehe!!), ACT scholarship, and Pell Grant. Hopefully he can do the same! (Then again, I'm just in Jr college....)|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Its very important to me.<br>  <br>  I want them to have a good life and be financially stable.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter as long as they get some schooling.<br>  <br>  I will pay for what I can and I will help them get loans if they need me to.

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It is a choice, but unfortunately they make you go through tremendous hoops in order to make that choice. <br>  <br>  You can get religious exemption for vaccines, and some parents hold off because of preexisting conditions (not autism-related). I don't think they'd force you to homeschool if you didn't vax, but who knows - in the future they might. While I vax my kids, it's just another way for the state to step in and take control over your kids and have a say in your parenting. <br>  <br>  That said, I believe *most* vaccines are necessary, especially in order to prevent spread of diseases that have long been eradicated. There's a reason why we don't have polio or measles anymore in this country. But some are pushed too far - some states are considering mandating the Gardasil/HPV vaccine, for God's sake - and of course this is headed by Merck, the drug's manufacturer. I say, butt out of my business and let me decide (at least on that one).|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Yep, we ended up having to immunize our 18 year old last year.  He came to live with us (my stepson) and his Mom had decided not to immunize him as a young child and the school system here said unless it is against your religion, you must be immunized or in the process.  Well, it's not against our religion, so we started getting him immunized.  He has one more round of shots to go.....and get this....<br>  <br>  The last round was right after his 18th birthday, like 5 days and apparently my insurance doesn't have to cover immunizations on "adults" and they weren't going to cover them!  BOY did I feel screwed.  Forced to immunize him by the school system and then NOT covered by the insurance company.<br>  <br>  Luckily the insurance company reconsidered.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I think it's their way of trying to keep the spread of disease down. Let's face it, kids can be filthy, which makes them excellent little germ spreaders. lol <br>  <br>  But I found the school immunization thing to be a pain my rear end. By the time my oldest reached 6th grade, they decided he had to have the chicken pox vaccine. Shoot, I thought the chicken pox was a right of passage...|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Less immunizations= more virus which = more chances of mutating to a resistant strain. The CDC has 1000s of generations to try to predict when not if  the next pandemic breaks out and what kind. Schools fall under state and fed. control. Since all the above is know the US gov is trying to postpone and or limit the exposure when it occurs.|`|FYSa6n7Kaa	Each state has different laws on the books about exemptions for children who are not immunized.   Every state has to let a child go to school if their parents have religious reasons not to imminize their child.   Many parents these days do not have their children immunized, because they have they have weighed the risk of the vaccines  verses the diseases the vaccines are for.    Not all states allow parents to use that reason.  Such parents can still use religious reasons.  Many school official try to say the vaccines are required.  When that happens just a simple call to the superintendent of the school district will resolve that problem. In a few case a parent may need to go higher that that.  A school district can make all children who do not have vaccines stay home in the event of and outbreak.   I fostered parented my grandsons and choose to opted them out. Not because they were not immunized. but because I did not have their immunization records.  No way was I going to have them go through that all again. just so I have the records to prove it.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	My children are also immunized but I have a close friend who does not immunize her children while I don't agree with her reasons she does have some. She was able to put her children in school by saying due to religious beliefs she was not immunizing her children. My issue with is some people may be willing to risk their child getting deadly diseases but what gives them the right to expose my child to it?? Immunizations save lives and I don't think it should be ok for children to go to school with out them but it can happen!|`|f3f3bVRcaa	You have to be aware that by not immunizing your child, if your child contracts an infectious illness then there is a very high chance that this can be passed to another child or staff in such a densely populated area like a school, where your child is in close proximity with many others. Therefore, by not immunizing your child you are not only putting your child at risk, but OTHER children at risk as well.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	It IS a choice to immunize your kids. Parents also have the right to home school their kids, and should have to if they don't get them immunized.<br>  EDIT: That is my opinion. Did you ask people for answers, or for them to just agree with you? I thought you were asking for answers, as you said " Answers would be great though".|`|Gem96NQyaa	Because schools are concerned about the students as a whole, not the individual.  Immunizations mean less disease in the schools... plain and simple.  Kids get sick enough in schools as it is because so many kids are packed into such a small area for several hours a day.  It's irresponsible to allow a child into an environment like a school without immunizations.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Most people who choose not to immunize will get a religious dispensation to attend  public school. For the most part, they are lying, but I guess that is their choice, too.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	They don't! It is illegal to refuse a child admission into school because they are not vaccinated. I can't believe how many people think that kids must be vaccinated to attend school. It is absolutely, utterly untrue.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I received a note in the mail from our health unit 2 wks ago saying I'd better get our dd immunized or she's be suspended from school.<br>  <br>  I'd forgotten all about doing it but I certainly don't like the feeling of my hands being tied. There's a lot of peope who don't immunize bc of some of the ramificatins (or talk of it) so I think it's rather silly for a school to dictate what should or shouldn't get done when it's a choice bc clearly it isn't. Somebody just doesn't want to call the shots!
pT7jrsAgaa	Yes, we have a rule...no jumping on the bed till momma can come do it with ya! :)|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Yes, my 5 year old broke his arm last year from jumping OFF the bed, and onto the floor !! He's a right little genius lol<br>  <br>  He's very stubborn, and he very, well, hyper at times. He thinks, after he acts. It does make a difference ie ''the older the wiser'' and, he learned from his last mistake anyway because he hasn't done sense. He prefers the trampoline that he got off of santa now lol ...|`|AA11109728	Yes!  For one, my daughter is currently in a toddler bed that my mom lent to us.  Therefore, it's not as sturdy as a regular bed and I don't want it broken since it's not ours in the first place.  Second of all, we live in an upstairs apt. and I'm pretty sure the downstairs neighbors wouldn't appreciate that!  Third, nobody should be jumping on the bed cuz too many accidents happen that way.|`|4dQ3xu7Aaa	I really don't have a rule of " NO JUMPING ON THE BED", but I only let him jump on the bed (age is 5) when I'm in the room watching him.  When I was little I was jumping on the bed and broke my collar bone, that was painful and I couldn't do so many things because of it.|`|1b99e3c989a8ef3d74e6b0f508c6420aaa	I dont really have a rule....<br>  <br>  But sometimes I like to join in when my younger son is jumping, just to make him laugh. LOL...<br>  <br>  but then again, our bed is low to the ground and I usually keep an eye on him to make sure he's not near the edge.<br>  <br>  I'll probably be telling him to stop pretty soon.|`|ki3XY49daa	I'm one of "those" parents.  I just let my kids be kids.  I have four and all of them are especially fond of death-defying stunts such as jumping off beds or couches.  You can tell them all day they're gonna get hurt, but until they fall off...they're just not gonna care..lol|`|45nSn7Rcaa	No jumping on the bed at any age because the bed is made for sleeping and it damages it to be jumped on and of course there is the little matter of safety.|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	Nope, it doesn't bother me. We routinely jump and wrestle and play rough in the bed. When she gets big enough to jump more than a half an inch high, that may change.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	I try to insist that Emma sit down on her big girl bed.  No big deal, I just remind her we crawl on the bed.  I just worry about her falling.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	yes.  my son got stitches after a bad landing jumping on his.  knowing my kids, it's pretty inevitable that wouldn't be the only time.<br>  <br>  i know some of our friends don't have that rule.  i'm guessing they have somewhat more sedate kids so it's not as much of a safety issue.<br>  <br>  <br>  *i am so with you reddevil.  that same son has also been to the er for three other head injuries.  my other kids have had their turns, too.  they're really active and adventurous kids and we also deinitely need no help from springs in getting injured around here.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	We have a 'no jumping dangerously on the bed' rule.  If they can do it one at a time, or far enough away from each other that they won't bump heads & not crazy enough that they run the risk of hitting their heads on the headboard, then they can jump to their hearts content.  <br>  <br>  I often have to reign them in when they're losing control, though.  It's easy to lose control when you're having so much crazy fun.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i do but my fiance doesn't lol- i often find them bouncing on the bed together. my my brother was aroundd 3 he fell off and got stitches. he knew he wasn't suppose to be jumping on the bed so he told the doctor a stranger pushed him off the bed- he thought he would get in trouble or arrested or something if he told the truth|`|nVQGpvuoaa	We don't have a rule.<br>  Because well one me and my  brother kinda grew of that.<br>  And two, we never really did just cuz when we did like to jump on the bed.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Yes! After my stepson split his head open jumping into the ceiling fan. Head wounds bleed so much!!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	My wife does I don't. Big surprise there.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Yes, I will have a "no jumping on the bed" rule when my daughter gets older. The reason is because it's clearly not safe. I had an incident when I was younger, and I was jumping on the bed and I fell and I wacked my chin off the headboard. I split my chin open - it was not pretty.<br>  It's better to be safe than sorry, and I don't want my child getting hurt like I did!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yes. It teaches discipline and it's a safety violation (we call it that) at our house. Our beds are high off the ground and I don't want my son to jump and fall off it and hit something and I keep things on my bed too sometimes (remotes, laptops, my cell phone) I don't want him to fall while jumping and break a tooth....and having a rule lets me discipline when I need to. Children need rules and guidelines.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	yes, no jumping on the bed because I'm tired of going to the emergency room with injured kids! LOL<br>  <br>  My 18 year old stepson has been at least 8 times...tooth thru lips, broken wrist (jumping on trampoline) running into tree, concusion, chopping off finger with garden shears etc...<br>  <br>  My 8 year old has been twice, once for high fever, once for concussion<br>  <br>  My 10 year old has been three times, stitches on his face all three times.<br>  <br>  We don't need any help with accidents in our household! LOL|`|qR3MYSOIaa	Yes.  Because when my son was barely 2 he was jumping on the bed with my daughter and he required 3 stitches over his eye after he landed and hit the frame.  <br>  <br>  I remember jumping in the bed and it was so much fun, we had a big iron bed with springs so we could really high, lol...I guess we were just lucky we never cracked our heads.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	When i was 3, my mother told me and my siblings to stop jumping on the bed. My brother tackled me(playfully) and i fell against the bedpost and hit my head and broke my collar bone. <br>  <br>  My kids are not allowed to jump on the bed, exactly because of that reason up there. <br>  :)<br>  -Lauren.|`|8oAlBL91aa	haha yes we have that rule not like he listens to it anyhow, we have the rule so he doesn't fall and break a bone or crack his head open or break the bed.<br>  <br>  We have been to the emergency room enough lol. They will just see us coming and be like oh crap lock the doors haha.|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	I am not a parent, but when I have kids, I will not be allowing that.  My brother ended up having stitches when he did it one time and I don't want to have that happen to my kid.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	No, never needed one. They have never hurt anything or anyone by jumping on the bed so it was never an issue.

vKEYa8aeaa	ive used the same cleaning products all throughout my pregnancy and my babe is totally okay, he is actually growing 1 to 2 weeks ahead of schedule! the woolite rug stick is totally fine. for other cleaning products, if the chemicals make you sick or burn your nose or just over power you then get some of those painting masks, thats what i did during my first trimester, after that the chemical smells didnt bother me. OH and if you are cleaning a small area make sure a window and door are open for ventilation. <br>  <br>  congrats|`|uuHPneEcaa	I don't use anything to clean (i don't do the cleaning brother handles that) So I am not sure. U can call ur doctor and ask them what all cleaning products u can use. <br>  <br>  So sorry if I didn't help u out any|`|BbfIHWxzaa	better question---do you absolutely HAVE to. the answer to which is NO.  <br>  <br>  better safe than sorry.
GgMMvHI8aa	Yes it happens, your hormones are basically going haywire right now. ANd you are 38 wks.  <br>   <br>  I would suggest stopping the day care for now. It is time to focus on nesting, and getting yourself ready. Adding extra stress is not good when you are so near to delivery. Take a break. I am pretty sure all the mothers whose children you watch will understand. Just be blunt and say you need a break .|`|MqFeJiukaa	I have been the same way the last couple weeks, esp with my kids.  I really try to take a deep breath and walk away.  My 4yr old is the one that frustrates me the most.  I feel so guilty but I know it will pass as soon as I have the baby and my body gets back to normal.  I usually just try to talk to my husband and tell him when I feel like I am going to snap so I can go sit in our room for a few min and relax while he tends to the kids.  When he is at work I just stick to the routine and if I need to take a breather I just say I have to go potty be right back.  Good Luck!
CVdcrY3kaa	I have it and I love it. I'll never use another monitor. It went off once a few months ago, I ran to my daughter's room and I swear she felt lifeless. I started freaking out and trying to wake her up, and I heard her take a big, deep breath. I don't know if it was a false alarm, or if it really did help...but I'm thankful I had it and I'll use it for my next child. <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and yes it does help me sleep better.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I bought it for my first daughter and now currently use it for my 2nd daughter. My daughter is a belly sleeper and sleeps on a big soft comforter in her crib. The pediatrician told me a firm surface, because babies don't care where they lay, obviously she has never met my daughter, because she has to be laying on something soft, or she won't sleep.<br>  <br>  Well anyway, i love it and it went off on my oldest when she was 4 months old and when i ran into her room she gasped for air and then went back to sleep, so God only knows what would have happened if i had not had that.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I have one, and I never used the pad... we were so worried about the wire, and a couple times it was a false alarm.<br>  <br>  I worried more about the movement pad working right, then I actually worried about my son's lack of breathing.<br>  <br>  We love the little hand held angels, but the pad wasn't worth it for us.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	LOVE mine! When my daughter was 3 mo she started rolling over and we just could no longer keep her on her back at night. The first few nights me and hubby barely slept we were so afraid. So I bought the monitor and we tested it and trusted it to work. We totally did sleep better. We still use it and our daughter is 13 mo. the only thingis if she rolls to the end of her crib and sleeps along the bottom, it goes off. I guess the sensor cant pick it up there. but since she's older now we arent worried. we just go in and move her
bIaywrBCaa	I actually like them both very much. If you would like a more unique name I would go with Trinity.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	TRINITY!!??|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I prefer Alexie.  Alexis is my middle name and Alexia is a name i think is cute, so Alexie is very close to those lol.<br>  Trinity is an ok name but not as cute as Alexie is IMO.|`|miFe45quaa	Alexandra, with the nickname Alexie.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I like Alexia|`|heC9aQ18aa	Trinity I guess if I had to pick one. Alexie sounds too much like a nickname.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I much prefer 'Alex' to 'Alexie'. I think 'Lexie' is a nice nickname for 'Alex' and a good mixture of the name 'Alexie'.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	Trinity|`|Iw4Ed5Ueaa	Trinity is nice!|`|QOWyUr2taa	For me def Trinity - v.pretty x|`|AXEp1Bu6aa	I really hate both but if made to choose Trinity.|`|FR4fzr4Zaa	i luff that name -x|`|ODvnyAdlaa	i love the name trinity xx|`|AA10283947	Ooh Dear!

Y3DR1EBUaa	14 months apart yes they were planed i wouldnt change it for anything<br>  get along okay but i am waiting till last i 4 b4 i tryy for another|`|I7QcHkLFaa	My children are 8 years apart.<br>  <br>  My son oldest was and is very protective of his little sister.<br>  With them being so far apart they both felt like they are only children since they both have so much time by their selves with us.<br>  <br>  As far as bing different they are but not in the boy girl since but my son is very "book Smart" and does excellent in school but my daughter is very social and makes friends easily.<br>  <br>  They both were planned - of cource it took longer than expected for my daughter.<br>  We wanted our children about 2 years apart like my sister and I - we were and are so very close and I wanted that for my kids - but what we got was better because my son is very protective and my daughter is so proud of her bubby that they have a great friend ship.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Mine are about 16 months apart<br>  <br>  No, it was not planned, my wife was on birth control for our youngest so it was a shock to say the least.<br>  <br>  They get along great! They amuse each other all day long.<br>  <br>  Yes, we have a girl and a boy and we can tell and so can everyone else.<br>  <br>  This is a hard one, I think having them further would have been easier when they were both so young, but at the same time, I wouldn't have my boy be who he is, he could have come out a different person, you know??|`|4WyUrWaIaa	My son is 5, and Im 27 weeks pregnant now, so they'll be almost 6 years apart.<br>  <br>  My son wasn't, but this baby was, yes.<br>  <br>  I don't know yet lol, he seems happy that he's gonna be a big brother.<br>  <br>  Not yet !! Baby's gender is unknown lol<br>  <br>  No, I think now is a good time. My son is old enough to understand that a new sibling doesn't change much in his life, and that it's a positive thing.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	2 1/2 years for my oldest two, then there's 5 years between the middle and youngest.<br>  <br>  Tough to explain, LOL. No, for my older two. They're my nieces and came to live with us quite unexpectedly, so it definitely wasn't in our plans. We're now in the process of adopting them, something else we never expected to do. Our youngest was 100% planned, though.<br>  <br>  Usually, they're the best of friends. They have their moments, but mostly get on well. Both like playing with the baby too, but she's really too young to get along or not with anyone.<br>  <br>  Sorry, all girls!<br>  <br>  I think they have a nice age gap. We do want one more child, and would like to have him/her when our youngest is under 3.|`|ZTRakv6maa	i have two boys that are 22 months apart. they're older now..and they fight like 2 cats in a bag! then again....they are really close sometimes too. just depends on the kids personalities and how well they mesh.|`|SNVauR3laa	My girls are 12 years apart. Neither was planned, but I wouldn't trade either of them. My ten month old loves her older sister, and her name was the baby's fourth word. My older daughter is a big help to me. I was leery of this age gap, but it works well. That being said, if I had it to do over again, I would have had them closer together. I wonder what the baby will think when she is six, and her sister leaves. Also, I will be spending 30 years raising kids, and while I love them, 30 years is a long time.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	9 years, both planned, one of each no real difference. I think it worked out wonderful.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I don't have children. I am a teenager. <br>  <br>  But I wasn't planned because my mom was 18 and my dad was 16 when they had me.<br>  My brother was planned. He is younger than me.<br>  <br>  Me and him fight WAY more than we actually get along.<br>  <br>  There is only two of us and its really easy to tell that I'm a girl and he's a boy.<br>  <br>  And I would change it by maybe making him closer to my age. We are 7 in a half years apart.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I have a 10 year old a 3 year old and a 1 year old.  They are all boys.  None of them were planned.  The 10 year old and the 3 year old do not get along.  The 1 year old and the 10 year old get along well.  The 3 year old and the 1 year old are best friends. If I had the chance I would do it all the same...no regrets|`|8oAlBL91aa	6 years apart<br>  <br>  First wasn't this one was<br>  <br>  Well I'm still pregnant so I'll have to wait and see lol<br>  <br>  Actually I wish I would have thought it through a little more and I would have had them about 3 or 4 years apart.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	My son is 3 and will be 3 1/2 when my daughter is born.
T0gv52CDaa	Some of us are fortunate and breast feeding alone is enough to lose all of the weight, but for other people (and you may be one) they don't lose it until they stop breast feeding.  I had one friend whose doc told her that just as it took 9 months to gain it all, it can take that long to lose it all.  Also, I don't know what size you were prior to pregnancy, but I've noticed that my previously skinny friends have a lot more trouble losing that last 10-15 lbs, than me and my larger friends.  I was not a skinny woman at all prior to getting pregnant, and with both of my chilren, by the time of my 6 week check up, I weighed less than I had prior to getting pregnant, with no exercise or dieting of all.  (I tease my skinny friends and tell them that this is the one advantage to being overweight).|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	You just gave the key word - you're breastfeeding. You aren't eating enough to compensate for the calories exerted during your day. <br>  <br>  Try eating more protein and more fruits/veggies. If you do, you will see results. <br>  <br>  Also I have to say - protein shakes are NOT really that healthy for you unless you pack them with fruits.|`|kmQqbxpQaa	If you really want to lose weight and see results quickly, try the atkins diet.  My husband did it.  He weighed 235 and went to 180 in about 8 months.  It is a high protein - lo carb diet.|`|AA11606975	just keep up on it, your body will change eventually|`|nVpTT6z2aa	Losing weight is all about eating the correct number of calories.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below, it's and adult daily calories calculator and it gives an approximation of you basal metabolic rate (the number of calories per day your body burns)<br>  To lose weight and burn fat you need to try to eat 500 fewer calories per day than your daily caloric needs (basal metabolic rate) and exercise.<br>  Do not go below 1200 calories per day!!! unless your doctor told you so.<br>  It is very important that you know your BMR!! it will make it easier for you to know when you are burning fat. Use the link below to calculate you Basal metabolic rate!! xoxo<br>  PS: after you know how many calories you will be consuming per day, ask your doctor if it's healthy for you after giving birth and if it's enough calories for breastfeeding!!|`|JxmJg37Iaa	u do not need the protein shakes though but otherwise it sounds fine, just hang on and u wll shed the weight in no time,  instead of buying protein shakes by the fat burner powder which is the same price roughly, i only need protein shakes if u r body building.|`|7zQdJijOaa	i think you should always eat something when you hungry, or its bad health for the baby. try not to loose weigh yet. eat when you are hungry, go lose some pounds when u done having the baby. i hope this helps and try to sleep up to 9 hours because thats the normal hours we have to sleep|`|PNZxIFPvaa	For me, I was not able to lose the rest of the baby weight until after I stopped breastfeeding. As soon as I stopped the rest of the weight came off. Just keep active and eating healthy and the rest of it will come off. Good Luck!|`|1U8f6m2Paa	My best friend has been struggling with postpartum weight as well! She has started running close to 5 miles everyday and the weight has really started to fall off! She also does Yoga 3 times a week. <br>  <br>  Just increase your cardio, and good luck!|`|AA10513143	Stress and lack of sleep did it for me!|`|2w8GLGzyaa	yeah|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Give it some time, you're doing everything right..you'll lose weight. The only thing I'll suggest is eating smaller portions, more often during the day. This speeds up your metabolism. I still eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner...but small portions with small snacks inbetween each.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	This happened to me with my first. I absolutely could not get the last 10 pounds off no matter what I did. Then my son self weaned at around 16 months and the weight fell off in like a month. With my second who is now 6 months I have about 5-10 pounds to go and I'm losing it slowly.
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Nothing until you are over 12 weeks|`|uuHPneEcaa	nothing yet.. wait a while. I waited until I found out the sex of my child before I brought anything. I mean I guess if u wanted too u could get dipers and wipes and all the lil stuff but nothing big.<br>  <br>  u are really too early into ur pregnancy to buy stuff.. My grandmother still doesn't want me buy him anything I brought wash cloths and she got mad at me.<br>  <br>  i am 21 and scared I think everyone is when its their 1st. Just dont worry about buying things right now. just think about u and the health of ur baby. Don't worry about buying stuff right now okay.|`|kT7GVOosaa	I was excited just like you are so I bought neutral oneses. at the same time remember that you will have a baby shower and almost everyone will get you clothes so don't buy to much. if you are going to find out the sex then try to wait till you know to buy to much. otherwise go to town and stick with neutral|`|tljc8Axkaa	you need not to worry about this just yet i didnt go and buy anything until i was 30 weeks gave me somthing to do at the end of my pregnancy so i didnt feel it was dragging|`|JRXpYW3Naa	To be completely honest. I wouldn't buy anything yet, I'd wait another month. I lost a baby and it was just horrible to look at the blanket I had bought for it.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	why are you shopping so early|`|A6S5Tx2Oaa	A book to chronicle all the changes to enjoy and share with her later.  It may stop you from killing her when she is 13.
krQiDGCHaa	You sound pregnant to me.  If you were due on the 20th at the latest, that is today.  You COULD just be getting your period a tad late this month.  Why not try taking another test?  Wait until tomorrow morning, because your hCG (pregnancy hormone) is highest with the first urine of the morning.  If tomorrow is negative, I'd test again in 5-7 days, or see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust to you!|`|vigFmfLmaa	Most women don't get those infamous pregnancy symptoms before they've missed their period or found out they're pregnant.  That whole pickles and ice cream at 4 weeks thing was popularized by tv.  Your strongest pregnancy symptoms typically occur between the 8th and 12th weeks.  My assumption is that your period is late for whatever reason, possibly stress, and you're having pms symptoms, which are remarkably similar to pregnancy symptoms.
yWU57CLYaa	I would bring your daughter in to get a check up from her doctor.   I did the same with my daughter when she was younger.  They took an x-ray of her hand to make sure she was not growing to fast.  Some kids will grow quickly when they are younger and then stop growing all together at an early age.|`|jMGyLvNsaa	Well, I believe that it is okay, because I also look older then my age. Everyone is different so I would check with your doctor. But, I do not believe that it is a big deal.|`|xRd6Nxdvaa	no theres nothing wrong my neice is 12 and looks like shes 21 its just that today physically kids grow up much faster these days because of proscessed foods and the extra chemicals they put in food and drinks|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	Can you explain better?  How tall is she?  Did her period start?  Does she have acne?  Are her breasts developing?  <br>  <br>  You should always consult your child's doctor.  Bring it up at the next annual checkup.  The doc didn't say anything at the last annual checkup?|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	She hit puberty at age 5?|`|MXnSWKCkaa	try having her see a doctor or a nurse|`|AA12218589	No dude. You simply entered a parallel universe that is seven years ahead of the one you just left.|`|XesQJFNqaa	To fix this don't drink as much beer.|`|bqlvntzEaa	she looks 12 or is tall like one? idk i guess she has a lot of hormones|`|4WyUrWaIaa	A doctor might be an option?
DZzBfzVeaa	melony is ok, but i really like the name rose! its pretty!|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Amelia Rose<br>   Amelie Rose<br>   Matilda Rose<br>   Madaline Rose<br>   Hannah Rose<br>   Melody Rose<br>   Ella Rose<br>   Jena Rose<br>   Lucy Rose<br>   Lauren Rose<br>   Abby Rose<br>   Charlotte Rose<br>   Harmony Rose<br>   Amber Rose<br>   Bethany Rose<br>   Camilla Rose<br>   Chloe Rose<br>   Danielle Rose<br>   Emma Rose<br>   Emily Rose<br>   Gemma Rose<br>   Hayley Rose<br>   Katie Rose<br>   Kerry Rose<br>   Kimberley Rose<br>   Megan Rose<br>   Molly Rose<br>   Milly Rose<br>   Natalie Rose|`|heC9aQ18aa	Melony spelled that way is ugly. I'm sorry. If it were spelled different as in Melanie it would be very nice with Rose. Spelled Melony it looks like a hybrid name between Melanie and Melody. Sorry.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	I like the name Melanie spelled like that and Rose is like SUPER common. My Rosalie instead?|`|mRQxlNH5aa	Pretty but I'd spell it Melanie. Unique and beautiful!|`|bIaywrBCaa	Beautiful!! I love Rose for a middle name. It is timeless.|`|AwjmyLJcaa	I don't like the spelling of the name simply from a grammatical viewpoint.  The spelling looks like an adjective to describe something that is melon-like, for example, "yum, that salad is really Melony".  The name isn't bad at all, just don't care for the spelling.|`|hggYZSyQaa	Sweet name! But Rose for a middle name is use mostly these days so how about Rose Melony or Rose Melenie there so cute!<br>  <br>  Here are some more:<br>  Rose Joy<br>  Rose Faith<br>  Rose Swift<br>  Rose Taylor<br>  <br>  Or switch them round! :<br>  Joy Rose<br>  Faith Rose<br>  Swift Rose<br>  Taylor Rose<br>  <br>  I don't really like Rose as a middle name,it's so overused!|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Looks like a combination of the name Melody with the word felony. And Rose is overused and common as a middle name.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Why don't you just use Melanie? Melanie Rose is beautiful.<br>  <br>  Melody Rose is nice too.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Melony Rose is nice - I much prefer the name Melody though. Its alot more modern.|`|LmlIzdwsaa	Im not crazy about that name.|`|e663a3eea9acd94ea0c82d74d58bb3cbaa	Maybe you should spell it Melanie. That way it wouldnt look so made up|`|ODvnyAdlaa	thats a great combination i love it xx|`|mndpyoV1aa	I like the name Melony and I dont like the spelling at all. Melanie I think is the only good spelling of that name and the name Rose I dont like that name at all. Like it is making its way to the top of my hate list real fast. it is so common and overused. It sounds so old and idk people use that name cause they think it is the only  "pretty" name. Melanie Lynn sounds pretty.  I dont know I just dont like the name Rose.|`|cXdoFRVsaa	Well... it and Malanie Rose and Melody Rose and others that sound just like it are extremely common. I would choose one or the other and add a different other name that is really uncommon. Melony reminds me of watermelon.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I don't really care for the spelling of Melony to be honest. Otherwise, it's alright.|`|DSb9ln83aa	I don't really like the name Melony. What about Janassa? I love Janessa Rose.|`|naScu7lgaa	I LIKE THAT NAME IT SOUNDS GOOD 2GEHTER U COULD ALSO TRY CARLA LETICIA|`|Iw4Ed5Ueaa	i like Melony Rose but I think Rose is a better first name|`|Ba6SSkzBaa	I really dont like it. It sounds like a bath&body works lotion...
cXdoFRVsaa	Josh.<br>  <br>  Definitely Josh.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Josh is more of a good boy, blonde hair blue eyes preppy sounding name<br>  <br>  Zack sounds like a bad boy, dark hair, big muscles<br>  <br>  Zack would win|`|miFe45quaa	Zack would win.<br>  Like "MrSbRoWn" said: Josh is more of the good boy, and Zack is the tough, outrageous one.<br>  <br>  Zack attack...haha.|`|PVbJtssZaa	zack would win.<br>  think about it, when u hear the name zack, it's always the name of a bad boy. lol<br>  Zack and Cody for example.<br>  Cody's all sweet and smart<br>  and Zacks all dumb and the trouble maker lol|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Zack, no doubt :P haha. Any Zack I've ever known has been a bit on the "bad boy" side, and one has a mohawk.. which I automatically associate with all Zacks, apparently haha.|`|AA11206135	Well.. I have a Zach and a Josh......... Zach is bigger but Josh is wiry,and has more stamina, so it'd be a draw.|`|50ab85f362cbbddab47844295a4bba7caa	Zack would kick butt!|`|a30ecb945fa87adba95177ae3c5294a7aa	That's easy, Zack would win.  No, just joshing, it would be up for grabs.|`|7JiF5X1Taa	Josh just sounds more...........buff!!!!!
vigFmfLmaa	About a week.  Most are fertilized in the fallopian tube and travel down to implant in the uterine wall 5-8 days later.  This is the point where the pregnancy hormone (hcg) begins to multiply and will eventually give you a positive pregnancy test, also about a week later.  This process is why testing too early is pointless.|`|jZPv153Jaa	it usual happens during ovulation sperm can live in u for about a week and it takes about 2weeks for the egg to atatch to the uterus|`|AA12333757	6 to 12 days~|`|smsUZG4Iaa	about 6 days|`|ESAM0U7xaa	i have read it takes 3 days or so for fertilization...then another 3-7 days to attach. <br>  so your looking at about 10 days of so total. but it may take even longer to test positive. usually safe to test 14 days or later!|`|FASzVGrraa	between 6 to 12 days!|`|AA11764194	between 6 to 12 days to attach the uterus..
aEmdURPTaa	Amazon has them all!|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	Babies R Us, Target, Walmart, Borders, Barnes & Nobles...<br>  <br>  My daughter LOVED  Baby Einstein.  Her favorite was the Water one.  The bright colors, characters, pictures and music really appeal to them.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Target , Wal-Mart. Pretty much anywhere DVDs are sold.<br>  Ryan got a few for Christmas, he loves watching the TV and colors anway.<br>  So sometimes I will turn the DVDs on for him, dont know if I would spend my own money on one tho.|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Best Buy has them|`|pXSKSS3daa	Target, Walmart, Babies R Us.<br>  <br>  I haven't used them. I watched one at a neighbor's house while we were having a playdate and they honestly looked way too slow and boring to hold my son's attention. Give one a try, though, your baby may like them.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I think Target sells them. I was given one, but my daughter has never watched it. I've read many studies that prove that TV, even if it's geared at infants/toddlers doesn't do them any good. I'd rather her physically play with toys, or do something else.
Lqyjp7Xraa	they'll go down eventually it depends if you are going to breast feed or not if you choose not to they should go down within 1 month after baby comes|`|8oAlBL91aa	If you went from big boobs to small boobs you would feel the same lol it's just natural to not feel right in your own body.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	your only 18 so they will go back the way they were sometimes they can drop a little but as your young i doubt they will i was 17 with my 1st and my boobs went back to how they were<br>  <br>  they will stay big whilst your breast feeding if you do that<br>  <br>  im a UK 32dd size 6 <br>  <br>   your nipples usually stay a darker color after pregnancy too not so pink|`|0pAczRv2aa	well i am sorry to say your boobs dont really get smaler after, my mom was the same way small and she had pretty small boobs but after having her 1st baby her boob did grow and they didnt get smaller i am sorry <br>  and your not wired to want small boobs it actualy quit norm. for women i dont want huge boobs when i am older but i dont want like nothing there haha <br>  i hope you do better with you rnew big boobs.<br>  good luck(:
hw3OMoeZaa	Im with Kim B,  I am 21 weeks along and my DH drives me nuts.  He is so loving and caring it makes me feel smothered.  You knew he was like this but now that the hormones have kicked in it's a problem.  Have you tried talking to him?  It might help, maybe let him know before hand that it's not you, it's the baby making you crazy then it wont seem so personal. GOod Luck|`|v3LnJycKaa	oh good grief wanna trade :) ... i love my hubby to death but he wants to be all over me ever second huggin me, touching me etc... he gets so hurt when I say please leave me be... i dont like to be touched :)...<br>  <br>  anyway I would approach it very carefully you dont want him to think you are unhappy with him, just explain that with all these hormones it is like you just need him more, can he please try...|`|AA10458750	Just communicate with him. We all know men can never take a hint, you have to say exactly what you need and how. Let him know that with your body goign through so much changes it would be nice to be held and kissed on like he still thinks you're beautiful.|`|03fiqGJwaa	well the crying and carrying on is normal - hormones with pregnancy and all. i don't know how to fix it really, but i will say don't push it or he could just get even less 'lovey dovey'. as you mentioned, 'obligation' is a perfect affection killer.<br>  <br>  i do wonder if you didn't realize this before you got married and started having kids... it always baffles me at the things married couples complain about. oh well that's really none of my business... or is it... anyway...<br>  <br>  he's probably just lazy... seriously.|`|6c6cd701c07632417c9e0cf850ab2fe1aa	I have feelings like that every now and then.  I'm 27 weeks pregnant with my first.  It's amazing how emotional you can get during pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  You do need to tell him how you feel because at this time, you are emotional and since you have felt this way several times throughout your pregnancy it's best that you remind him how he needs to be with you at this time.  Alot of times, men don't understand the emotions we go through and it's best if he understands and provides you with the affection you need.|`|bd5sn0WSaa	When he DOES show you affection, make sure that you respond to it every time.  Make sure you tell him things like, "I love when you rub my back..."  It sounds like maybe you're a bit insecure, which is normal.  You can still give him pleasure even though you are not in the mood.  Tell him that you can make up for lost time once the baby is born!  Talking about sex and how you feel is the key...<br>  Good luck!
seU9VwIJaa	Try the mexican hat dance on my bladder! Do kegal exercises. It will help with labor AND make your bladder a little stronger! I'm with the first post. I have to wear liners because even the smallest sneeze can make me leak a little. I've heard plenty of stories where my friends and family members didn't make it in time, so if I think I have to go-especially in public, I go to the first restroom I can find!<br>  Congrats and good luck!!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I'd wear panty liners if you think that might happen. LoL It could. I know some people get SO pregnant that they pee a little with they sneeze :)|`|S8x3eHQhaa	I'm at 34 weeks and my son keep dancing on my bladder it does cause some "leakage" but nothing anyone can notice try wearing pantyliners also you can practice kegels it's an exercise, what you do is flex the little muscle that makes you stop peeing flex that muscle for counts of five for a few minutes a day that's a great exercise I've also heard it's good for the birthing process but I had a c section so I don't know for sure. Good Luck.|`|Fa130w6Gaa	It hasn't actually happened to me but I have been very very close! With both pregnancies my babies seemed to have a thing for kicking my bladder. I usually stuck near a bathroom or at least made sure to use one frequently. Sometimes I would wear a pad for just in case. Good luck!|`|dR4QN0gHaa	Yes. I just wore a panty liner in my last trimester in case that happened. Also, if I coughed, sneezed or laughed sometimes there would be a little trickle of urine. Not very attractive I know...but true.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	my baby stayed on my bladder<br>  i had to wear pads bc i couldnt go 30 mins without leaking on myself|`|812874d02f72331b1d1a4fa6424dc06daa	I'm 29w3d pregnant and my son pretty much lays on my bladder 24/7. And kicking it, especially at night seems to be his favorite activity. And it is possible for babies to kick hard enough to make you pee on yourself. So far this has only happened to me once,but it was totally unexpected. Thank god I was at home when it did happen. It's all just a part of pregnancy though. Congratulations and good luck!|`|pSOMZH66aa	trust me it has happen to me thats why i wore like  a pad or something cause when i got closer whenever my daughter kicked and i sneezed i would almost pee myself it suxs i know but come preared with depends|`|0Icoukhgaa	im 30 weeks 1 day pregnant ,and my son sometimes kicks in my bladder and makes me wanna pee or it causes an accident lol.  its normal!! babies move alot and they kick where ever they want LOL
DRb4Qlypaa	The placenta can still grow during any miscarriage, also, the baby may have just been traumatized but did not die.<br>  Edit: You were right with your terminology "abortion", but most people refer to a natural abortion as a miscarriage and a purposeful abortion as an actual abortion.|`|iwYu32N2aa	I think you mean a miscarriage and not a abortion? Right? Plus if you were bleeding/spotting before the u/s and had one and the baby had a HB then I think that the baby is still there. I hope that I understand your question.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	You should go to the doctor.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Yes, it can still grow. That happened to me, only with NO signs of a miscarriage. This is what a blighted ovum is, its when the baby dies and is absorbed into the mothers system, but the body still thinks its pregnant and continues to grow. The baby had died at about 10 weeks and we didn't officially know until 15 weeks when they did a D & C. (I just knew I had lost the baby, regardless of what the Doctor said)
op55FtqYaa	It works but it can take a few days. <br>  <br>  I had one and went into labour 3 days after. The only other thing I could suggest is bouncing on a yoga ball to put the baby into the right position. But ultimately the baby will come when it wants to!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congradulations.|`|rBPi6N2daa	Well, I think if you are close to labor, it'll work.  It didnt work for me, but I wasnt dilated at all, and only somewhat effaced.  Im hoping itll work this time around!  They say it produces prostlandins, or whatever that word is, to soften the cervix.

FASzVGrraa	ive been off for a month! i just started my period so this first month didnt work for me! some women get preggo on the pill so it all depends! good luck and baby dust!!! <3|`|vigFmfLmaa	It's possible, though unlikely, to get pregnant that very cycle.  My friend got pregnant the cycle after stopping bcp.  Most drs suggest waiting 3 months because it's been shown that conceiving with residual bcp hormones in your system can cause birth defects and increase chances of miscarriage.|`|G1j3Ja5Iaa	they say it can take anywhere from 3-6 months, depending on how long you were on BC for..but I was only on it for 11 months, and it took us 1 year and 2 months to get pregnant! So I think it really just depends on the person and how the BC affected you...good luck and baby dust!|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Technically the day after you stopped but usually it takes a couple of months to get your cycle back to normal.|`|AA10478146	It took me 4 months.  The first 3 months I stressed about it.  The 4th month I didn't think about it and it happened.  Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  33 yrs. old|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	it took two months for me to get pregnant. everybody is different. xit also depends on when you ovulate.
x84MEAv5aa	hello! I don't really have any tips that will help other than the obvious!<br>  <br>  We tried for 7 months and I got tired of being brokenhearted that I decided not to try. Well Sure enough that month I GOT PREGNANT! <br>  I now have a beautiful healthy 10month old!!! <br>  GOOD LUCK TO YOU!! Just remember that it can take a normal healthy couple 6 months to a year to conceive.<br>  <br>  BABY DUST YOUR WAY!|`|vigFmfLmaa	I would just have fun and practice a lot.  Marketing companies know that TTC is a soft spot.  What other time in your life would you pay $75 for a month's supply of ("fertility") vitamins?  Eat healthy, get a little exercise, take care of yourself - for most people that's all it takes.  In the beginning for sure you shouldn't be worrying yourself about magic pills and gadgets.
oHNrktxTaa	Yes, there is always a chance on becoming pregnant. <br>  <br>  Hopefully, there wont be a next time, but I suggest using the Clear Blue Easy digital OPK sticks. They are SO much easier than the ones with the lines & comparing colors. These use O or a smiley:) when it determines your LH surge prior to ovulation. <br>  <br>  Remember, the OPK sticks cant get you pregnant, but can help increase your chances. My husband & I have been ttc the past few months & I started using the OPK sticks. <br>  <br>  Good Luck & baby dust to you!|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Typically you will ovulate 12-36 hours after the first positive. Sometimes it can take a few days your surge to come back down. You are probably covered, but one more day wouldn't hurt if your hubby is up to it. Maybe try some lingerie, that always works on my hubby!|`|vigFmfLmaa	That's the thing with guys.  They are constant horn dogs UNTIL you tell them they *need* or *have* to have sex with you.  Plus guys just don't like the thought of babies and sex together.  It creeps them out. I try to let my DH know as little as possible about when I O.  You just have to be subtle so they don't get the performance anxiety.  <br>  <br>  The thing about OPK that most women don't get is that a line doesn't mean you're ovulating.  The line that is darkest and of course darker than the test line indicates you will O in about 1-2 days.  So you weren't ovulating since Wednesday.  Ovulation is a one time thing - it happens once and doesn't happen again until the next cycle.  Whatever day you had the darkest line (the positive) you would O in the next day or two.  So you should have sex those days for sure.  It's also a good idea to have sex the day you get the positive so you have  a supply of sperm already there waiting on the egg to be released.<br>  <br>  I would try some of the online stores to get OPK test strips.  They are much much cheaper than store bought ones.  Sometimes I have to use over 12 in a row to get my positive.
bUkwtZghaa	My baby is six weeks and she has a rash as well.  It is either baby acne or an alergy.  Does he cry excessively?  Hannah has a milk protein intolerance and I was drinking too much dairy and didn't know that was our problem.  My dummy pediatrician said it was colic and baby acne.<br>  So long as there isn't excessive crying to acompany the rash, it is probably just baby acne from the hormones of being born.<br>  I hope it clears up soon!|`|t9W31mzqaa	It may just be some baby acne, which would go away in a couple weeks, but legs seems a little strange to me..  Did you use any new detergent or soap? I know that that may cause a small rash sometimes with babies because their skin is sensitive, but if you notice its getting worse, or if you have a feeling it might be something, then call her doctor. Its better to be safe then sorry, especially with a rash..
fMilDRgLaa	My boys are 20 months apart. We gave my oldest a present  from his baby brother.  We even bought things small here and there and claimed it was from baby brother.  I don't know if this was the right thing to do, but it worked.<br>  <br>  Why don't you have a party for your daughter and tell her that her baby brother has planned out a special day for her. Read them books together, have her give her brother thanks by hugging him.  <br>  <br>  She probably feels neglected.  She wants attention.  Remember she was the baby until a couple of months ago.  Also, talk to your pediatrician.  Mine has helped me on all levels of sibling rivalry and everything in between.|`|fBGq6BL6aa	Spank her with a belt and tell her next time she messes with the new baby she'll get another beating.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	your 2 year old is the one who needs separation.  Buy baby gates and keep her and her toys confined to one room.  At her age she needs no free roam, to get in trouble and hurt herself or another.  One time it takes for her to seriously hurt your baby.  And you and I know you cannot possibly wathc her every second.  Install some big christmas bells on the gate, so if she gets out or knocks the gate over you will her it.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Mine are 20 months apart.  And now that the younger one is mobile every time I send the toddler away or to the chair the younger one follows him!  <br>  <br>  There was a stretch where the toddler kept scratching the babies face, and one day I kept gating the toddler in his room so I could cook and do dishes and the baby would go stand by the gate and get scratched and cry until I came and took him away and then he'd go right back.<br>  <br>  It is a bit better once the toddler and baby can play, but that's months off.<br>  <br>  All you can do is keep trying, and keep them apart as much as possible when you can't watch them.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	My friend has a two year old that from time to time hurts her brother.  We put her in time out behind the baby gate.  She cannot get out and we are able to do chores then.  When we are done, she is let back out.  If you son is sleeping in the crib make sure you shut the door behind him.   My friend's daughter has problems with doorknobs.  If she can open the door, lock it if you have to.  Priority is to keep the baby safe.  With my own kids, I made a big deal about my son going to be a big brother and bought him books and gave him a T-shirt saying I am a big brother.  The books would talk about how to be around the baby and how a big brother can help like picking up the dirty bottle and bringing it to mommy.  I even let my son pick out his brother's name.. (I know too late for that.) I always had dates with my oldest son. I told him he was my first love because he was born first but I loved them the same.|`|4ThvQYi9aa	I think a lot of moms forget that being a good mother involves a careful balance of love and discipline! It's great that you are trying to discipline Gisele and try to make her understand that she is hurting her baby brother! The problem is that even though she 'says' she understands, she clearly doesn't. Try to sit down with her on her level and explain that he is a little person and is NOT a toy for her to play with. He could be seriously hurt! Start by telling her how much she is hurting him and ask her how she would feel if someone did those things to her? It is not okay to hurt another person and you should be really firm in explaining that to her.|`|ZusC87WBaa	As hard as it may be, you are going to have to watch her ALL the time.  She's probably jealous of the baby and unsure of where she stands with you.  Next time, tell her you need her help to take the laundry out of the dryer.  Also, try to plan some things that the two of you can do alone.  She needs to know that she is still every bit as important as she was before. I know it's a real juggling act, but it will pay off in the end and she will adjust.  Good luck.|`|tz1aVHoUaa	what you should try to do is get someone to supervise her while you clean or do what you need to do or you could promise her a treat if she listens to you, that's what i do to my little twin sisters and i know how hard it is as i've taken care of them up til now as both my parents work. keep her occupied with crayons/feltips (washable preferably or she'll draw on the walls), or promise her you'll take her on an outing if she behaves. hope it works like it worked for me<br>  XxxMwahXxx
6gthdHpnaa	Probably like social services or children's services. They help children who have been victims of abuse or whatever. They will make decisions about what will happen to you. And they will make sure you're not abused again and that you are in a safe place.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	The Social Workers who are gonna check on you and bring you to a foster home, I'm sorry to hear that you were abused.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	I dont know, but i hope they help you. I got no help really, well they tried to help but failed.|`|bS7DN85Qaa	They're social worker who do what their name says: They protect children from abuse, sexual or physical.
ki3XY49daa	Most likely, you're having Braxton Hicks contractions.  You're far enough along that they might start getting kind of rough.  The best thing you can do is lay down and rest.  It's probably going to get worse, but believe me, you will know the difference.  Labor pain will more than likely bring you to your knees.  Drink lots of water and rest and they should subside, or at least lose their intensity.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	It's probably your body getting prepared for the event to take place.It may not be right away,but is there any consistency in the contractions,like so many mins.apart.Is this your first baby? You didn't say.If you are worried Call your obstetrician|`|8UujqaV0aa	you are probably having braxton hicks contractions, basically your baby is getting ready for delivery. look them up on the internet its probably what it is. best of luck to you and your little one.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	they wont look at you until your water breaks but when it does go to the hospital|`|Axcy1DYlaa	Is there any spotting??? If it's constant cramping I don't think it's labor. If there's spotting you should immediately go to the dr's. if not.. just relax with your feet elevated and maybe a hot pad on your back (helps my constant back ache) <br>  <br>  If the cramping is not constant, i would say they are just braxton hicks contractions.<br>  <br>   The more you have the closer you are to going into labor darling. maybe time your cramping. <br>  <br>  I really don't think you're going into labor. Wait it out (unless there's bleeding or spotting of any sort) you only have 6 more wks to go!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	if u in any doubt you could go get checked, at the hospital they can monitor you and see what happening<br>  personally this early i would coz they can try and stop labour for a few weeks if that fails they an try help strenghten babies lungs<br>  could be braxton hicks but you shouldnt be able to time them and they dont get stronger the more u have x<br>  <br>  good luck x x
OtDOAAZwaa	Brody and Kayley how cute<br>  also Caleb and Caden :D<br>  u have a great taste in names :D|`|a05cVdPLaa	The names are a little eccentric for my taste but that is fine I'm glad you like them.<br>  <br>  There is only one thing I have to say. If I were to have twins I would not have their first names similar or start with the same letter. They are individuals I wouldn't like to be named the same thing as my twin, like I wouldn't like to be dressed like them. <br>  <br>  Just a thought, but I like the names (except Brody, sounds like brooding, probably not a good thing to name your child.)<br>  <br>  Good luck when you actually do have children|`|WTXvmcxcaa	Oh! Brody and Kaliegh are so cute! I can almost see them! Oh! They are adorable names. <br>  <br>  I don't blame you. Twins would be awesome. A handful, yes, fun, ABSOLUTELY!!!    <br>  <br>  My mom almost had triplets! Can you imagine having three? It was kind of a bummer when only one made it, but now, I can't imagine having three more in the house. Still, it's nice to think about. :)|`|oX3xf2gTaa	those are very cute i like the last one best i have twin names 4 u taylor and tyler i like that because taylor and tyler can go for boy or girl but personally i like taylor 4 a girl cuz taylor is my name and im a girl|`|AA11897739	i am a twin and my mom name us toni and tarrol we r girls the my boyfriend is a twin and his name is mark and his sisters name is michelle|`|hyG0c5Nnaa	Caleb and Kaleigh, but if you like the same letter you can do kaleb and kaleigh.|`|aNrjfpyaaa	Ridge and Brody! Very unique:)|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I love Caleb. <br>  <br>  I like all of the names except for Ridge.|`|WCNpfXNnaa	I think that Caleb and Caden are a little too similar. Speaking as a twin there is nothing more frustrating when you meet twins named taylor and tyler, because twins are two different people and they need two different names to be able to separate themselves and form their own personalities. I Love both names though, just not together|`|14d624ecb8f49b22e0ecfc5000158635aa	the second two are the best in the sense that the rest are like some sick joke. what kind of name is ridge. A name is for the child, not for the parent that wants to give a name that sounds cute only in her ears. not the ears of all  those eager classmates waiting to make fun of your kid. your passion may be twins but my passion is stopping parents from making up retarded names for their children. The last two I could have sworn were Marvel comic book heroes.|`|xZG0q6vXaa	Do you have 3 sets of twins already?|`|RjpGomsyaa	I certainly would not choose any of them except Kaliegh|`|qrd27oqsaa	I like Brody and Cadan. Caleigh would be better than Kaleigh. The rest I don't really care for.|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	I don't like Ridge, Brody or Caden but Kaleigh (prefer Kailey) and Caleb are nice names.|`|AA10041941	Love Caden & Kaleigh...?|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I don't like any of them. They are all too "trendy", sorry!|`|LmlIzdwsaa	i think they are wicked cute. i love the name Brody! and Kaleigh is my name except i spell it Kailee. : )
ZusC87WBaa	My husband worked with a guy that lost a baby to SIDS.  Scary as it is, you really have to try not to focus on it too much.  I tell myself that there is a grander plan and that there are a lot of things completely out of my control.  I had my 5th baby last month and I still lay my hand on him to make sure he's breathing before I go to bed.  I don't worry myself sick over it, but the scariest part about SIDS is that it is unpredictable.|`|FLpMShKNaa	I think its normal, my mom told me you have to let some of it go or you will lose your mind. I knew of some people when I wroked for the health department and it was very few. Follow all the precautions and try and enjoy. However, my son is over a year-both my husband and I have to go and check on him in his crib every night to make sure he is ok, and if I wake up any odd hour I usually can't go to sleep before I check on him, so some of its human nature.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i was the excat same way as u and still am <br>  i over protect him from that but i just waited and pray every night and hope hes still alivie <br>  im just wading it out and i try not to worry about it that much|`|14JQ11AUaa	Yes, I have! I am constantly worrying about that with my 5 month old son. You can do nothing but what you are doing now and just hope for the best :)|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I think all new moms worry some about SIDS. There are precautions you can take though! Like putting your baby to bed with a pacifier, and turning a fan on in the baby's room. You can also put a wearable blanket on the baby and keep everything else out of the sleeping area. If you are still worried about it you can get an angel care monitor. (I think that is what it is called.) I bought one for my niece. She was born with a very low birth weight, and her mom smoked throughout her pregnancy (and still smokes around her!). Thankfully my niece is a healthy 18 month old now! The monitor acts as a regular baby monitor as well as a sids monitor. It has a mat that you place under the baby's crib mattress and it detects even the slightest little movement. If it detects no movements for like 30 seconds, and alarm will sound in the baby's room and over the monitor to wake you up. Usually the alarm will startle the baby to start breathing if she has stopped. Also you can obviously run in and check on the baby. That might give you some peace of mind!|`|RKbxxjJuaa	Being freaked out is normal....no joke, when my daughter was born, I called the hospital every time she did ANYTHING...baby has the hiccups, baby slept 15 minutes longer today than yesterday...etc.....so much so that they knew me by name!  The fact that you have a healthy baby girl is something you should celebrate!  Don't waste this precious time worrying, enjoy it because its gone before you know it!  And althougth I haven't looked into statistics, if you have no family history, and you've gotten a clean bill of health from the pediatrician that checked her out before you left the hospital, don't consume yourself with worry....be catious and careful as one should with a newborn, know that nothing is promised, and that there is the potential for something to go wrong with ANY of us (not just the little ones) at ANY time, but hope and stay focused on the GOOD, don't dwell on the "what ifs" or "could bes" these will drive you crazy!|`|bf03f3398ae59403fb987824b585b742aa	You just being a concerned mommy. I worry about stuff all the time and fear the worst. I bought a breathing monitor to give myself peace of mind when my little one sleeps.<br>  <br>  I live in South Africa and worry all the time about getting broke into all the time and my little baby girl getting raped. South africa has very high crime rate.2 neighbours have been broken into in the past week, and their are some really sick men who believe that sleeping with a young virgin cures Aids...baby was raped and died at 6 weeks old a few months back.<br>  <br>  Try to relax(pot calling the kettle black...I know) and enjoy your little one.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Alright - corny answer...here goes!<br>  <br>  Maternal fear is normal and can be incredibly strong. At the same time, there are some things we can't control, and we need to acknowledge that and learn to cope. The best way, I've found, is to 'release' the fear.<br>  <br>  The best ways, I've found, to release that fear is to be proactive with taking care of my babies (making sure they're safe and sound - the gear we use, the way we feed, the toys we buy, the safety gadgets, how we bathe, how we sleep, etc.). Then, I try as often as possible to simply enjoy 'being in the moment' with them. When I'm looking into their eyes, breathing in their sweet smells, and blowing raspberries on their bellies, those fears and worries are nowhere around!<br>  <br>  We're all going to worry sometimes, but if we can acknowledge it, use the fear to help prepare to keep our children safe and then release it, it's definitely 'copable'. I know it's corny, but it works for me (still), and I hope it's of some value to you too!|`|oZEPi0nuaa	I made the mistake of reading someones heartfelt story about SIDS online when my baby was born. I became so afraid of it, that I refused to sleep, I started watching her every moment she slept to make sure she was o.k. When she was about 6 months She started sleeping in our bed with us.I started to let myself fall asleep but would jump up every few minutes panicking trying to see if my daughter was o.k. I became so sleep deprived that I was no longer myself. Finally when she was over the age of 1, I began to only wake up about every hour, rather then every few minutes. Now she is 19 months, she still sleeps with us and I wake up usually twice a night and check on her. Unfortunately I don`t know what to say to help you, but I`ve been there, and I understand what your going through! I took the fear too far, and I let it control my life, I hope that you don`t let it do that to you!|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Yes one of my friend lost her daughter when she was 4 days old. We just bought a Angel Care Movement Monitor. It sets off an alarm if the baby stops moving ( including breathing ) after 20 seconds. I love it. I think I will be able to sleep better at night. Like you I am so scared of SIDS. My son is a stomach sleeper. Just keep up with what they say no bumper pats, sleep on the back, run a fan at night.|`|tz1aVHoUaa	awww blesssh, i felt the same with my twin sisters, but you just got to face your fears and live with it, be Happy not worried and think on the positive side. don't get frustrated over things with a minimal chance of occurring, just to reassure yourself be cautious at times when you should but in the meantime enjoy yourself too.<br>  XxxMwahXxx|`|EcSbNWMbaa	You shouldn't be scared about that if you just said she's healthy and there aren't any risks.....|`|Z8mmsOIqaa	No, but you know these people put this unnecessary fear into new mothers about the whole process.  They are just trying to educate you but in many cases go about it badly.<br>  <br>  Just be educated about these ailments and care for your child the best you can, you will know right from wrong for your cherished baby don;t worry!|`|c4bUIENuaa	yea im really scared too. my boyfriends cousins baby died a few days ago and she was only 2 months old... so sad<br>  <br>  my baby is 11 wks|`|GB3MVI1Maa	well you said ur baby was HEALTHY <br>  so dont worry your self <br>  you baby will be fine x|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	We had a baby monitor that detected even the faintest movement (my daughter's breathing, even).  If the baby stops breathing the alarm goes off after a few seconds, so you can run in and save the baby.  It's not that I thought my daughter WAS going to die of SIDS; it was just that I'm paranoid and could barely sleep for worrying.  Ours only went off by mistake a couple of times, but it didn't bother me because I figured it wasn't for real and didn't mind checking just in case.  It has really good ratings and helped me sleep at night, big time:  <a href="http://www.target.com/Angelcare-Movement-Sensor-Sound-Monitor/dp/B0000E262S/sr=1-1/qid=1235156756/ref=sr_1_1/191-6233208-8151415?ie=UTF8&frombrowse=0&index=target&rh=k%3Aangelcare%20monitor&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Angelcare-Movement...</a><br>  <br>  Other than that, you could try having your baby close to you at night.  We are doing a "sidecar" setup with our next baby, due in August.  I don't feel comfortable with a newborn sleeping right up next to me, so this is an acceptable compromise.  Having your baby in the room with you, you'd be better able to notice any abnormality in breathing, color, etc and do something about it.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Sadly the only infant deaths I hear about, are when ignorant parents are intentionally killing their children.  With that said, do not fret all parents worry about one thing or another.  It starts with fetal problems, moves to SIDS (which incidentally a new study says to leave a fan running in your infants room to significantly reduce the risk of sids, it is all about the oxygen moving around)  It moves to kidnapping fears, peer pressures, etc....Do not worry, you are normal  <br>  :)|`|IFDfpbFJaa	It's a normal fear. I have very detailed visions about my son being smacked by a car and seeing his lifeless body on the pavement being worked on by firefighters while cops are holding me back. It's normal....it was really bad when he was younger but now he's 3 and it's warn off....I'm very cautious with him though, I let him be a little boy and get roughed up but I'm a worry wart.
VY4LqfLpaa	you took the words out of my mouth.  Maybe I should let my husband see your question and see if that would open his eyes a little bit...|`|1YHih8wyaa	I think this can happen to any relationship at any time. There are days when I just looove my husband and then the're days when i could go without seeing him. I think you need to have a very serious conversation with him and let him know how you feel. dont argue about it tell him in a calm matter. ask for his input does he feel neglected too. my husband and I had this problem about 2-3 months after our daughter and we told each other that we have to have an honest relationship with each other. He also didnt feel like being intimate with me during the pregnancy because we had just experienced a miscarriage with a previous pregnancy and he was just scared i also took him to the ob appt but it didnt help.<br>  <br>  it will get better trust me. also sometimes after childbirth some women can go through post pregnancy deppression. i think my husband went through it too. i dont want to take their side but it can be hard for them. they were used to having you to themselves and being each others only attention and then this other person enters the world that needs 80%of your time. like i said talk to him see if you can work things out dont just give up and leave. keep pushing that marriage counseling try to figure out why he refuses to attend a meeting.|`|7kosr9mcaa	I could swear you are my own conscience writing this for me...|`|PYIA2FCFaa	i dont know how to answer this. my marriage ended in divorce due to stuff like this..but we also had a stillborn that played a role in it.<br>  <br>  he really needs to agree to counseling. my husband (at the time) refused counseling too...now we are divorced and he knew that would come next if he didnt go..so thats shows how much he "really" cared **rolling my eyes**|`|VkzmH1GKaa	You need to do what is best for you and your child, follow your heart it may lead you to anyother person that will always appreiciate you. Prayer can guide you in the right direction.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	this didn't happen to me, but my BFF she had her baby Dec 2. her husband works long days and when he gets home he won't even pick up the baby and talk to him. She let him name the child a name that she hates and he still doesn't want anything to do with him. She gets so pissed but he just ignores her. They only have a one bedroom house and he won't even sleep in there bed because the baby's crib is in there. He's slept on the couch for the last 3 months.|`|85bf9affa8a14cf017087b756bc02b72aa	First of all sorry for  my bad english, I am not american and I am still working on my english.<br>  <br>  OMG I am impressed to see your situation, I have been going through the exactly situation.<br>  I had a baby in august, and my husband is not the same, but in my situation he is the one that is not attracted to me anymore. he sleeps on the couch. I was gone for brazil for a month and he rarely called me, when I got back home our cable bill was almost 400 dollars. <br>  he says he is always tired ad do not wanna have sex, but he is never tired for porn. I feel neglected too, I dont have family around.I am totally alone and he treat like nothing. I really understand your pain. My husband also doesn't wanna go to counseling.<br>  It is easy to say to you to just divorce him and live your life, but I know its not that easy. you have a baby together and its a big deal.my mon was a single mom, and trust me its tough!!!!!<br>  I wish I could open your husband's mind and tell him how precious it is to have his wife and baby around, but he is taking you for granted. i dont understand why guys are like that.<br>   Dont feel bad about yourself. you will get your body back soon. I did it!! so can you.... show him that you love yourself better than you love him, dont let him put you down. I am selfconcious because of my husband aattitudes and I truly hope you dont gt that low self-steem because of a flat stomach.<br>  What has made me feel a little better and still gives me hope in my marriage is God and only God. I pray and read the bible.<br>  Trust me, God hates divorce and he can change everything!!!!!!!!!<br>  He can make you fall in love all over again with your husband, keep your hope ad dont give up! Think why you married your husband at first place.<br>  Does he know how you truly feel about him??????<br>  if he doesnt know just tell him how u feel, if he does know and just dont care.. I dont know what to say. He is not giving your the value you deserve and that is why you arent attracted to him anymore.<br>  so my answer to you is only one ...GOD. he will make a miracle, if you have faith!|`|bUkwtZghaa	This happened to my hubby and i after our first child and we subsequently split up for six weeks.  I felt like I was doing everythinga nd he was just goofing off all the time.  It ended up working out and then we got back into the rut and each had an affair (as a direct result of these feelings we were trying not to acknowledge) and when it all came out, everuything has been fabulous since and we now have four children and i feel that we couldn'[t be stronger.  <br>  I guess what I am saying is if you don't (and I don't mean you as in just you, but, both of you) fix it it will come to a head and you may or may not be strong enough to make it work after that damage has been done.  <br>  I hope it works out for you but, just understand there are raging hormones on your part and none on his.  And he just dosne't get it.|`|gC1ITdJUaa	Girl I know how you feel. My husband is so awesome with my son - but he never takes care of him or plays with him. It pisses me off because he wants me to take care of the baby 24/7 and then take care of his needs and not get mad. I know I signed up to be a stay at home mom... Which means cleaning, doing dishes and laundry, taking care of the baby and the dogs, etc. But a little help would be wonderful sometimes.<br>  <br>  Although we were still very close when I was pregnant and he was awesome. Maybe you guys have just been so distant for so long that you're just used to that. I lost a little feeling for my husband after having my son as well - which I think has really turned me into a major b****.<br>  <br>  Tell him constantly that you need counseling together. After about a year of telling my husband, he finally agreed. And my son is only 4 months old.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I'm sorry you have to go through this crap too. I know many women do.<br>  <br>  I saw what you added... M husband is in the military as well. I think its just that they're like trained to be all... Emotionless and it has a horrible impact on your marriage.|`|mWv1Ql6vaa	I am no where close to getting married. First of all, congrats on the baby! I was just thinking maybe your husband is just stressed from all the new baby things. He just may not be used to having this great of a responsibility. This might explain the computer and video game addictions as a way to vent his stress. He definitely should try to help out. With a new baby he should also help take care of you, and love you, no matter how you look. I say just give the new baby thing to try to sink in with him. If things are not better, simply tell him how much he means to you, as well as your marriage. Try to work things out together at home, but if that doesn't work, result to a councilor.<br>                                                 hope this helps! from a young teen trying to help a grown up, Wendy :]
uLeXGHnKaa	It's perfectly normal for pregnancy symptoms to disappear as you enter your second trimester - that's why they call it the most comfortable trimester! If the only thing that's worrying you is the lack of uncomfortable symptoms you have nothing to worry about, if you had miscarried there would have been bleeding or at least some pain. Just enjoy the fact that you don't have to suffer, and try to keep your mind at ease until your next appointment. I'm sure your baby is perfectly healthy and fine.<br>  <br>  If you're really worried though, you can always call your doctor and tell him your fears, he'll probably be able to reassure you better than someone on yahoo answers :)|`|hzlqCBWnaa	i asked this same question a while ago. well right now its normal to not have anymore symptoms. im 22wks and sometimes i dnt even feel pregnant. i also dont feel her move all the time either. im sure your fine!! the chance of you losing the baby at this point is little to none. what i did was rent a fetal monitor like the ones in the dr offices, so now every day i hear her heartbeat! congrads on your baby! :)<br>  hearttones.com >>btw|`|OBn4a7rzaa	Your baby is fine. I was scared around this time too bc i couldnt feel her yet, and i was feeling much better as far as the nausea and other symptoms. I was worried and searching all kind of negative things on the internet, that only made me worry more. But guess what, I got my u/s at 19 weeks and im having a girl, and she healthy, and coincedentally, i have started feeling her move numberous time a day, and the cutest thing is, that now, when i wake up to switch positions in the middle of the night, i feel her kicking and pushing, as if she is getting comfortable in my new spot also. Give it like 2 more weeks and you'll be feeling the same thing, and then you wont worry about it anymore, bc as soon as i catch myself thinking, well, i havent felt her in a while, she will punch me with her little fist. Give it a little more time.|`|a1x0xqARaa	I would say that you're okay.  You're just worried about the baby, as expected.  Once you feel that noticeable twinge in your belly, your mind will be set at ease.  As for the having the sex pains, I think that's normal too.  Pain might come and go throughout your pregnancy.  Everyone is different, though.  But honestly, I think you have nothing to worry about.  If you really get concerned, call your doctor and ask.  Asking is always a good thing.  Especially if this is your first pregnancy.  Good luck!|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I think that you are worrying for no reason because I went through the same thing... all the obvious pregnancy symptoms and then they started to fade, the only think that I felt was her move every so often. I was told that it was because my body was getting use to carrying the baby around and being pregnant. Now I am 25 weeks and I feel a lot more pregnant again because I feel her move so much now!! :) Anyway, don't worry it will get easier!! Good luck!!!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I think you are worrying for nothing :) Part of being a mother I am afraid. Missed miscarriages happen almost all of the time within the first 12 weeks. Bc of chromosomal abnormalities. The baby stops developing but the uterus doesn't expel its contents. The fact that you had an u/s and everything was fine, should put your mind at ease. During the second trimester it is sometimes hard to even feel pregnant. You aren't showing that much, your nausea usually disappears, you can't feel you baby moving around yet, your body has gotten used to the extra hormones so you feel much better. If you were to lose your baby this late in your pregnancy, your body would let you know with bleeding, cramping, etc. Try not to worry! We have all been there!! Best Wishes!!|`|PZkzhI9Faa	If this is your first baby, feeling movement can take up to 24 weeks with some women,  Also, given the fact that a week ago you had a healthy u/s, i would not worry.  As far as the increase in energy goes, it's very normal to feel dead tired one day and like you are the energizer bunny the next!  Sex w/my hubby can hurt some days, others it won't (it all has to do w/the position of the cervix).<br>  Don't forget, the 2nd trimester is known for being the calm before the storm (third trimester). Relax and try to enjoy yourself!|`|gzQIstDFaa	i know i was really scared during that same time period thru my pregnancy. youre at that point where you arent having any more of the first trimester symptoms but u arent really feeling the baby move yet either. its the time when you dont really "feel" preggo.<br>  but as long as u havent had any heavy bleeding or cramps then you are probably worrying over nothing (isnt being preggers great w all the worrying? lol) but if u are really worried then just call your dr and maybe they can either see u or at least reassure u that everythings just fine
fMilDRgLaa	This may sound crazy, but get down on your hands and knees to his level and look at everything.  That is what I did to baby proof my house for my two sons.  The obvious things are listed in pamphlets.  You know your apt. best.  Any baby store will carry safety proofing stuff and a checklist.|`|pXSKSS3daa	You probably won't need much at first. We just have a couple baby gates up and the outlets covered. That's all we're going to do for now because I don't want to go crazy with the baby proofing. When he's actually walking around I may do more. Here are a few links that may help out:<br>  <a href="http://movingtoanapartment.com/apartment-safety/babyproofing-your-apartment-8-things-you-need-to-do-now.htm" rel="nofollow">http://movingtoanapartment.com/apartment...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.babyproofingdirectory.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyproofingdirectory.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.moms-home-safety.com/baby-proof.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.moms-home-safety.com/baby-pro...</a>|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	www.onestepahead.com|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	You need to put all breakables on higher shelves so your baby cannot pull anything down that can hurt her.  Remove any tableclothes from the coffee table and any other tables.  You don't want your baby pulling anything onto herself.  Consistently put pot handles away from reach.  Now is the time to buy a baby gate because there will simply be times that you cannot be there, and you can put your baby in her room with the gate up until you can be able to supervise again.  The baby's room should be the safest with very few toys, a carpet, and bed, and changing table.  Keep everything else off the floor.  Use babysafety locks to close cabinets and dressers.|`|9dbfcdfc542af168bc1600c2e255f400aa	So here is my take on safe proofing.  Do as little as possible.  When my daughter was born we went out and bought all the cabinet latches, door knob gizmos outlet protectors etc...<br>  <br>  The only thing we did was the outlets and one cabinet where all the cleaning chemicals are.  <br>  <br>  So many people will tell you keep everything out of reach or your child may get hurt....But what do you do when you go to a friends house that is not safe proofed, now there is all this neat stuff for them to grab on to, knock off and break.  If you work with your child at home not to knock the stuff off the coffee table they will not do it at other peoples homes.  <br>  <br>  You also set up a drawer for them in the kitchen.  In this drawer, you keep the sippy cups, plates and bowls that they use.  They feel very special cause they can get to it open it choose what they want.<br>  <br>  My daughter, now 3, traveled with us a lot to peoples houses and to this day she does not grab things off of tables or go into cupboards.  She knows where her stuff is and that is what she goes after.  Several of our friends have come over to see our valuables still out on tables, magazines and such and are amazed that everything is still in place.<br>  <br>  Long story short safe proof as little as possible, outlets are good and what ever cupboard you keep all your cleaning products in.<br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy the pleasure of your little one.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Edited <br>  <br>  The outlet protectors are very important. You really don't need to buy much more, rather just rearrange a bit.<br>  <br>  What we do is get onto the floor. Anything that might be trouble (sharp, 'pullable', etc.) we move or adjust. We use tables to block off stairways (we find these heftier and more stable than gates), and make sure areas around computers, garbage cans etc. are always cleaned up. Cords and cables can be hidden or taped up so they aren't accessible.<br>  <br>  Some specifics we've done also include:<br>  - putting a bit of duct tape over the central vac wall outlets because our little guy can flip them up and get his fingers caught<br>  - taping foam or placing pillows around sharp corners of tables and shelving<br>  - making sure that our recliner chairs are down when he's crawling because they're sharp underneath<br>  - Making sure pet water and food is in a different room from him (yep - he went right for that water dish!)<br>  - Lower his crib setting so he can't climb out<br>  - Removing the mobile now so he can't grab it and get tangled<br>  <br>  We've also gone through our son's toys looking for anything that he can break now or that might be a potential choking or bobo hazard with his throwing, dropping and chewing (i.e. stuffed animals with glued on eyes rather than stitched eyes). These toys will be cleaned and go into a bin for a while.<br>  <br>  There are so many gadgets you can buy, and some might be helpful, but childproofing can also be done on a tight budget using things you have around the house and using the 'eye of a baby' approach.<br>  <br>  By the way - you can pick up outlet protectors at the dollar store.<br>  <br>  Wow! Don't I sound cheap (tee hee!). I hope some of these ideas help!
61NKzPzMaa	Lincoln Ray is a great name. So lovely and masculine. Great for a little boy.<br>  <br>  I'm so glad that you got Ray on the correct gender.|`|AA11273571	I think it's very generous of you to give in to your husband about your son's name if it means that much to him.  Good for you.  Lincoln Ray works just fine.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I'm not a big fan of the name Lincoln. It reminds of the President or a car. But if you have your heart set on it, by all means use it.<br>  <br>  Lincoln is a very powerful name, Ray looks a bit lost.|`|86PuYgDJaa	I actually quite like it - I've never heard of it before either, I like how you're giving him the middle name of your grandfather too it's a nice gesture|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	Yes I think the two names work nicely together. My son's middle name is Ray after his daddy but his first name is Elijah :)|`|a1x0xqARaa	I like it.  Flows nicely!  Good luck!|`|LmlIzdwsaa	Not reallyy...|`|hWe8vhKKaa	it's very nice really does go with the flow|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I work with a guy named Lincoln. They call him Link. lol So if you don't like that nickname I'd suggest you change the name. Before him, I had never heard of anyone named that. I thought it was very interesting, but wouldn't name my own son that. Lincoln Ray does sound good together though and if your husband really really wants that name then, I don't know, that would depend on how much you hate it. Good Luck!|`|WTXvmcxcaa	It works. I think that Lincoln Ray flows well together. But, I agree with you. What kind of a name is that to give a kid? He might get picked on, because kids are like that these days. I get picked on for my middle name. Sonia. They say it's weird, but then again, so am I. They pronounce it wrong anyway. But, I guess Lincoln will work. Just don't expect people to stay quiet about it in school. Kids can get really cruel.|`|GLeRaf1eaa	I love it! Congrats!|`|MD1NUDsMaa	I like it just fine.  It's macho.|`|243bff959375fe2757f750ec38cc8274aa	It's cool.  I think it sounds badass, like you named him after the Lincoln in Mod Squad.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I think Lincoln Ray flows nicely.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I think it's a cute name, not somethin i'd chose, but since Lincoln means alot to ur husband and Ray means alot to u, then the name  it def. works.<br>  <br>  And yea it flows nicely.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|8uvb3Nroaa	Lincoln is a  cool name. It can transition from child to adult fairly well. and I like Ray too. Sounds like a nice choice.|`|45f16ecdf3512cfd43cf659533ee6503aa	I like it alot, and if he doesnt like being called Lincoln, he can always go for Ray, which is pretty cool IMO|`|I59qE0WNaa	not really..
Cr6uwfIwaa	first of all ~*BB*~ he DID hit her, if it wasn't true then why would he say hes sorry ?<br>  and about his punishment he's gunna have to pay a fine and maybe go to jail.Also he will lose lotss of fans and hes songs wont be heard as much since hes not gunna have as much publicity as he did before this happened..they already took out the gum commercial and the "got milk?" one too so we'll hardly hear from him but maybee in a couple of yrs ppl will kinda forget this but hes career wont be the same.|`|XFpnIlasaa	1-2 years of jail for assault and of course some community service it all depends on what rihanna wants....|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	He's gonna pay the $ 50 000 and walk away but will his career be able to survive this scandal?|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Who said he hit her?<br>  <br>  That is what is being speculated.<br>  If you look at the picture that was released...you'd notice that the two head lacerations on Rhianna match up almost perfectly. So either chris brown whipped out a ruler or straight edge to leave bruises on her in the exact same spot on both sides of her forehead, OR it was caused a different, more reasonable way...such as hitting her head on the dashboard, which also makes sense since many witnesses said the car slammed on it;s breaks, then they heard a scream.|`|E7ViD8EWaa	I hope he gets put away for awhile.<br>  The photo on TMZ is scary looking...<br>  <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/02/20/rihanna-photo-face-beating/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmz.com/2009/02/20/rihanna-ph...</a>|`|ZXhSQfvqaa	he better get locked up... ijust hope she wont take him bck, no matter how "sorry" he is.  Also, i hate all the people trying to defend him and say she deserved it.  it just goes to show how guys arent always as sweet or wonderful as you think. i mean, how could i guy who wrote forever beat her up like that?  easy, he didnt mean any of it.  She deserves better.|`|iwcp9rJzaa	probably nothing too big. he is a celebrity.<br>   i dont like rihanna or chirs brown.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Nowadays it would be a week in prison only.|`|bS7DN85Qaa	Yeah, he should be put away. Poor girl, I doubt she did anything.
xRZ1PRZwaa	Holy cow! Yes! Suri and your little angel are both just adorable!!<br>  <br>  You must have fun with that cutie!<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  <br>  I love the paternity answers! LMAO!|`|4iXL4C6paa	I think it is just the eyes|`|pXSKSS3daa	Maybe the eyes, but that's it for me.<br>  <br>  It's hard to tell because they are different ages and a baby's looks can change SO much in that first year.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	a tad bit|`|LWXRVO5Haa	There are similarities. I wouldn't just go by the picture tho. Demand a paternity test from Tom Cruise.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I can see a similarity.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	Looks like a baby to me|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I see a similarity.... Have you been sleeping with Tom Cruise? lol jk
ca9dEvSAaa	Mama Bear said it right!<br>  <br>  There is no age where it's now the right time. It's all case by case. For example - My 35 year old cousin is still partying using drugs, and living on the streets, however my 19 year old sister is married to a 21 year old police officer and they are heavily involved in the church.<br>  <br>  Who is at a better age to have kids there?|`|03f100b7d34df8ee17796e093fefa637aa	I don't think there is a certain age you can put on that.  As long as you feel as though you are ready in every aspect of your life then you go ahead and have a baby.  I am only 22 with our first baby but I have a loving husband of almost 3 years, a house, 2 dogs, a job, and some college education.  I don't care what other people think because I know we are ready for a baby in every way possible and we are happy.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	We are having our first at age 30.  We have been together for 10 years - got our parting phase out of the way, got to travel the world together, and got our careers on a very nice foothold.  Most importantly, we got to be together, and reach the time that we both said "I think now is the right time".  Neither of us felt forced into it, and we will be financially and emotionally ready for it.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	When you're emotionally and finacially able to care for a baby.  Oh, and it's nice to have a partner who feels the same.|`|68cc82283542fb9e45877505681f26ffaa	You can't really put an age on it, it varies by person.|`|SNVauR3laa	26ish. First you need to finish college, then get married (after dating a person for a few years), then be married for a few years, then add baby. That's what I tell my daughter's anyway. I want them to be at least 26. I think high-risk supposedly starts at 35.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	When you are ready. I don't think there's really a specific age when it's best to have a baby.

Q0xm1Kodaa	Yes you dont have to take the last week of pills, they are just sugar. Some people dont start their period though if they do this. I always started but a lot of my friends did this is they didnt want their periods for like a vacation. They would start taking the next pack right away.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	If you have intercourse, you could be pregnant. That's just a fact.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I don't have any personal advice for you, but motherisk is pretty good.<br>  <br>  But if you are planning to breastfeed you may want to wean yourself off fluoxetine towards the end of your pregnancy so you can switch to something else once the baby is born.<br>  <br>  Fluoxetine from pregnancy with the amount in breastmilk can cause problems.  And its not the safest choice for a nursing mom.  Usually moms switch to zoloft once the baby is born.<br>  <br>  If you do stay on fluoxetine make sure you have a doctor that is very knowledgable about breastfeeding to help monitor your baby.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|7kosr9mcaa	Honestly, I always think it is better to be medication free when you are pregnant. BUT if it is absolutely neccesary then please take your meds! I was on fluoxetine (Prozac) when I got pregnant, I thought of the effects it could possibly have on my child and decided I didn't like them. I was on it for OCD, I decided that I could live with the OCD for 40 weeks but I couldn't live with a baby who had affects from the meds which i could have prevented. If you can live with the anxiety or depression you have been percribed Prozac for then I would go off of them. But always follow medical advice.

I have kept their first blankets, some of their favorite toys from childhood, movies (which I need to have them recorded to a dvd now)<br>  <br>  whatever is special to them at certain ages or all ages, from now to adulthood. I also have pictures of all ages. A special ormanate for their first christmas, a stocking, a hat that they used to love and that had a story behind it, like they wouldn;t take it off to even sleep, or they had to have this stuff animal ect. <br>  I have kept all of these kinda of things and will give them to them when they have thier first child so that they can , have a piece of their childhood shared with their child.
TQW5E6olaa	I'd call the store and ask for a manager, given how that goes, I might call corporate.<br>  <br>  Funny, I kinda thought in store accidents was their responsibility to clean up...I mean it's their butt that could get sued if someone slips, not you.<br>  <br>  If my child was sick to the point that she threw up in the store, I would have pointed out the mess, apologized, and left. She obviously needs to get home, not watch me clean up the mess without the proper tools... How rude are those people, no compassion for you or your child, they just didn't want to deal with it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: All the comments about Bodily fluids, cmon, It's a baby store, it has to be expected...if a pregnant woman registering had her water break, would they make her clean it up before going to the hospital?????|`|kzyEuRroaa	I would have probably cleaned it up myself without them asking me to, as my kid made the mess, and if that were to have happened anywhere I would have cleaned it up no matter where (friend's house, WalMart, Babies R Us, etc).  Things happen, but I would not feel comfortable making some poor girl or guy mop up my kids puke, as usually Babies R Us has stock people, but not janitor's all hours of the day. <br>  <br>  If you had puked, would you make them clean it up too?  Or if you had spilled a soda in line, or your kid dropped a lollipop on the floor- are they responsible for all of that?  It is common courtesy to clean up after yourself no matter where you are, and I don't think you should be outraged by them asking that.  I've worked retail, and "puke picker-upper" was never part of my job description.  If you need to, find out where their corporate headquarters is, and start there.  Good luck|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Another example of customer service gone out the window.<br>  That's terrible.  They shouldn't have made you clean it up.  Call the babiesrus headquarters.<br>  <br>  found this for you:<br>  <a href="http://www9.toysrus.com/guest/contUs.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www9.toysrus.com/guest/contUs.cfm</a>|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Well put it this way....if you worked at babies r us would you want to clean up someone's throw up? Most likely not. I would of asked for some paper towels, a trash can and some cleaner and cleaned it up myself.|`|AA12221392	I would report to a manager, and if not satisfied go above them. <br>  <br>  I was at wal-mart the other day, and a little boy got sick, the parents did offer to clean it up, and was told no, it was there job as employees to clean up the store. <br>  <br>  They don't have to touch the vomit, and there are things called disposal gloves, that are made for these kinds of things and also cleaning bathrooms. They have to clean bathrooms, and I have worked in the public and you would be suprised as to how many adults are just plain gross, that **** on floors ect, it has to be cleaned and that is a body fluid. We put on the gloves and had to clean it.<br>  <br>  It isn't about you not wanting to clean up your child's mess but how about being able to get your sick child home and cleaned up as well. The nerve of these people. <br>  <br>  Call and ask to speak to a store manager, and if not happy, then call higher and higher. <br>  <br>  customer service has went out the window these days, and then they want to know why we aren't spending our hard earn money in thier stores? I will spend my money in a store that treats me like a person and just not another number in a check out line....|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	<a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/php/a_report.php" rel="nofollow">https://www.consumeraffairs.com/php/a_re...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  this is the link to consumer affairs, they already have several complaints on babies r us of different natures. thats just crazy,  i have never known ANY store to make you clean anything yourself like that. i would have taken my child  left my buggy and walked out, leaving them to clean up the puke AND put the buggy full of crap up and took my business elsewhere.<br>  <br>  what was she supposed to do people? scoop it up with her hands and put it in her purse? jeez  get real. how many  people travel with  a mop, bucket, and cleaning  supplies? they hire people to clean the tiolets, and every other  job in the store. that includes any and  ALL messes.|`|u9sGH0AXaa	I would go to the manager of that store, and if they don't do anything for you go over her head and find out your regional manager.  I don't know what I would do in that situation.  Have you seen their bathrooms? Disgusting!   I am dissatisfied with that store overall.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Call their corporate office and file a complaint. Look it up online. <br>  <br>  Just so you know, they don't clean up bodily fluids because it is a health hazard for them. Your kid, your mess is how I see it.|`|PdaiyUkDaa	1-888-babiesrus|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Call their main office. It is their job to clean it up. Good luck, I feel really bad for you.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	You should be able to call their customer satisfaction number and speak with a representative there.  Their number is 1-888-BabyRUs (1-888-222-9787).<br>  <br>  As a customer, though, you are not obligated to do anything.  If they wanted you to clean it up, you could have refused (politely) by saying something like "You know, I had better get her out of here before she gets sick again/I had better get her home" and then left.  Or, you could have said something like "I've had to clean up a lot of baby barf, and this (kleenex and a bag) just isn't going to work.  Do you have a _______?"|`|AA12145826	I'm in agreement with Diane on this one. As someone who has worked in the retail business as well as having worked as a housekeeper for 2 respectable hotel chains, I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that they have taken a training course on how to properly handle and dispose of bodily fluids. Most companies combine it with their "Blood-born Pathogens" training, which anyone working retail is supposed to be trained to handle.<br>  <br>  I would have never even dreamed of telling a customer to clean up something like that. Plus, you're not complaining that someone wouldn't clean it up for you, it was the manner in which you were told and the apparently lack of proper items to clean it up with. If they are that concerned about the "safety" of their employees and customers they should have had gloves, cleaner, towels, bio-hazardous waste disposal bags, etc. available all over the store in case of something like this. I would be more upset over that then anything else.<br>  <br>  I would call the store directly and ask to speak to the store manager, if you still feel dissatisfied, ask for the district or regional manager's number, calling corporate should be last resort because they could take the longest to get a response from due to being the farthest up the chain from the store you had the problem with.|`|mDt03eXIaa	You're right, you shouldn't have ahd to clean it up yourself. It's their job. And while I can understand other customers/employees being irritated with you for bringing a sick child (even if you didn't know she was sick, they don't know that haha) that still doesn't make it ok for them to make you deal with it. I work at a Wal Mart, (that never would have happened at walmart, btw. the janitors would have been cleaning it up while you took your daughter home) and on a store level, I've never seen much get done about customer complaints. You need to call their corporate office and talk to the district manager. I hope you remember the employees names.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	I don't understand.<br>  <br>  You have your daughter out, she gets sick and you are upset that the store didn't clean it up?<br>  <br>  I love Baby's  R Us, love it! They have a friendly staff, they have employees that know about the products. It isn't ever hard to find someone to help either. It's a clean environment and a nice store. Everything I need for my daughter is brought in to one store.<br>  <br>  So, if my daughter got sick, yes I might be a little embarrassed, but I would take care of the situation as I would at home, or at a friend's house. I would clean the mess up myself.  I would have appreciated some paper towels or something, but wouldn't have expected anyone else to clean up my child's vomit.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Their jobs are customer satisfaction, no janitorial/maid service. They aren't in the medical field, they shouldn't have to clean up your daughter's bodily fluids! You want to know about a stroller, they will tell you! You want to make a decision on baby furniture, they will help.<br>  <br>  Your daughter pukes in the store, you clean it up.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I'm not sure, but I've never heard of any store saying that. And I've gotten sick at a Walmart. They poured the dry-sweep over it and cleaned it up. I would have just left, what are they going to do, its their store, they should clean it up.<br>  <br>  (I'm also very dissatisfied with Babies R Us over all, everything about that store sucks, and they are right, they bathrooms are gross)|`|4iXL4C6paa	I would have been hot, I can't believe they told you to clean it up and you have a sick child that you need to tend too, you call and speak to the manager immediately and if that doesn't work go over his head and get those workers disciplined....that really is a shame that people are that ignorant.<br>  <br>  I dont know about everyone else but anytime I have been out and my children have gotten sick the store would atleast bring cleaner and a mop...|`|M2yERqNSaa	your kid puked, you clean it up. because its YOUR CHILDS vomit they may not be able to clean it up by law . before you voice your disatisfaction, look up the law<br>  <br>  <br>  this happened once in walmart that I saw, the worker said by law and company policy they are not allowed to touch other peoples body fluids<br>  <br>  there job is to sell you baby items not clean up your kids vomit, they arent janitors and no stupid people get on ya and whine and cry when people dont agree with them, like yourself|`|1gF9QVy9aa	Love "Busy Mommy's" edit!  Would they make a pregnant woman clean up her own amniotic fluid prior to getting into the ambulance?  Goodness no! :)  <br>  <br>  I would certainly call the store, the manager and corporate if you're not satisfied with the answers you receive calling the store initially. <br>  <br>  Not only would I have been mortified, but to just give you Kleenex and a shopping bag?  Oh heeellll no!  They were in the wrong.  They do have staff to clean up spills and messes........and it's their job to do so.  <br>  <br>  I'm so sorry this happened to you!!|`|vj3WSxzWaa	I have seen this happen a few times,and not to sound rude,but there are health issues,and if your kid pee's poop's or puke's on the floor,,they will have you clean it up,then come around with a mop and sanitizer and mop the rest themselves,,,So I do agree with Chad,,your kid,your mess,,,it is safer for everyone that way.|`|DvrpBX4saa	Call their number directly and ask to speak to a manager. If he doesn't handle it well or according to how you think he should have, then you can contact their corporate offices on their website.|`|OIS808Qmaa	Chad B, understood and agreed, however this should have been cleaned up with a mop and some water.  Go to Babiesrus.com and get the number for the corporate office to file a complaint.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Management, phone up babies r us and ask for complaints address etc<br>  You should not have had to clear vomit up yourself, i would be annoyed also,|`|E8RlvSbcaa	get over it they should not have to clean up your kids puke, what are you the queen of england? gross<br>  <br>  customer satisfaction isnt cleaning up puke dummy|`|yKS2UI87aa	Call their corp. office and let them know which store it was. I would have walked away and not cleaned it.|`|Yl93lP1laa	Go to the website and call corporate.|`|BnYrOfYraa	Hmmm....<br>  Some of these answers really surprise me.  Do some of you really think it's ok that this 8 month pregnant woman was expected to clean up her child's vomit with KLEENEX and a SHOPPING BAG?  What kind of store was this that they (apparently) do not have a mop & bucket?  <br>  And please, don't pull the "but, it's bodily fluid!" thing.  This is Babies R Us, the store with a mothers room where parents can breastfeed and change diapers.  The last time I checked, breastmilk was a bodily fluid, as is the stuff that fills diapers.  And doesn't BRU have a bathroom for the public also?   Yup, more bodily fluid.  I'm assuming SOMEONE there cleans the moms room & bathrooms.  Even if a cleaning service comes in at night, wouldn't they want to be prepared for accidents during the day?  Say, someones child vomits?  Or little Tommy wets his pants and it gets on the floor?  <br>  This really grosses me out.  That they expected you to use kleenex and a bag to clean a floor.  That is so far from sanitary it's laughable.  I certainly wouldn't want to shop in a store like that.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	i dont really like the way you compared the store to walmart or somewhere else just because babies r us specialize in babies. That dosnt mean the customer service is better does it. I bet if it happened at walmart, you wouldnt have had to touch anything. If you were not happy with just the kleenex, then you should have asked for a mop and bucket..it probebly varies from every store, its all about the people working or running the store, and maybe they have a policy. It wasnt like you spilled a pop, your daughter puked. i would have cleaned my own childs vomit no issue, just have to ask for the right supplies.<br>  Any how, i feel bad for you that they handled the manner the way they did but what you can do is make a phone call to the head office of toy r us. Each store has a store manager, so you could start with complaining there, or find out who that managers manager is and complain there. Im not sure what you expect to gain out of the matter, you will probebly just get an im sorry and that is really all they can do.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Technicly the janitorial staff is suppose to give you supplies to clean it up properly. And  that was very poor on their part. True they cant clean it up themselves anymore but still they could have assisted in some minor way like keeping people away and keep the lines moving so you dont get those looks. We had the same rule at Party City where I use to work and we have had many a sick kid do the same thing. I would tell the parent to go take care of their child and I would clean it up even though I was not suppose to. Im sorry your kid is ill and is wanting attention I can certainly help you out and deal with the reprocussions later. Im sorry this happened I swear stores are not here to help customers anymore but to just help themselves. Sad how we have let that happen.|`|tj0X2YaYaa	I think you should only report your dissatisfaction if they said they wouldn't clean it up AND didn't provide any tools for you to clean it up.  As it is, I think that you shouldn't be upset about having to clean up after your child.  Whether you knew she was sick or not, you should be the one to clean up after her because she's your child.  I think the only reason you can complain is if they didn't give you paper towels, cleaner, mop, bucket or anything and then expected you to clean it up yourself.
C1blHL9vaa	My CMV infection wasn't discovered until after I gave birth to my son by c-section. He has suffered no issues with relation to it except some hearing issues but there is no evidence that this was directly related to the CMV infection. From what I understand it is best handle if you do not give birth vaginally.

That way if the birth mother backs out she gets all the bills and your friend doesn't have to waste her money on the scammer.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Nope....otherwise it would be considered baby buying which is illegal and thats not what your sister is doing..right?.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Your sister needs to go through the proper legal channels to avoid a scam.  If she goes through the state, it is going to be better than going through a private adoption.  She needs to understand that she should never purchase anything for the mother, because if she does that can be considered baby buying, which is HIGHLY illegal (not to mention immoral).<br>  If she goes through foster care, she can avoid scams on the part of any prospective first parents and also avoid scams that the agencies use to procure children.|`|AA12174100	probably not, but also there are laws on how much adoptive parents are allowed to "pay" to the birth mom.|`|BTuFtui3aa	No. Any money paid to an expectant parent is by law considered a gift, and is given at legal risk to the prospective adoptive parents. You can't give money in exchange for a baby-- that's human trafficking-- so there's no expectation of quid pro quo. <br>  <br>  The mother has every right to decide to parent her own baby up until she terminates her rights. She would owe nothing to the prospective adoptive parents if she kept her child.<br>  <br>  If your sister wants to adopt locally, I suggest she look into adopting from state care. There are thousands of children in foster care waiting for permanent homes.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Never is it legal to get the money back.  If the first parents offered it would be, but chances are, they don't have it.<br>  <br>  It isn't even legal to give the first parents the money.  One can directly pay the hospital bills, but not the first parents. In our state, it's not even legal to pay anything extra on the hospital bill, such as if the mother wished for tubal ligation when she gave birth.  It's considered coercive.  Agencies take money for hospital bills, and if a woman goes into an agency and says she wishes to place her child for adoption, they teach her how to get medicaid.<br>  <br>  I urge anyone who does pay a medical expense or for anything for a first mom to never get mad.  Hormones are made in the body to prepare a woman to parent, and they're very strong, one of the top reasons a mother changes her mind.  Many times, these same women end up placing the child later, because the little quiet baby ends up being a loud baby, with a lot of needs and expenses. Besides that, if you don't get mad, perhaps you can still be her friend, and support her decision to keep a child.  I've done that with a few women who've been around me, and even though I don't get to raise these beautiful little ones, I love every hug and kiss I do get from them when they are around me.  It's one of the reasons life is soooooo good.
B7iSU8UYaa	The definition of a virgin is someone who has not had intercourse (penetration of a penis into the vagina). So yes you are still a virgin even if you masturbate.

S6N7hatNaa	My 17 month old little boy is the same way. He says a few words. Although he had to have tubes put into his ears about two months ago, he wasn't speaking clearly before that because he couldn't hear. Now he can hear and says the same words as your daughter. I think it's normal. You can try Baby Signing- that will help her to communicate. If you can get a picture dictionary or color picture books with several things, she wil start to point and understand and try to say more words actually. The pictures books worked well for us! Although it's not clear when it comes out, it gets MORE clear each time. Also, say EVERYTHING you are using with her. You just never know what she CAN actually say if she isn't being exposed to a large vocabulary. Read, Read, Read to her too!!<br>  Hope I was of some help to you! BE PATIENT!

That's the most devastating loss.|`|2A6xFP81aa	HURRY THE H*LL UP AND REVOKE YOUR CONSENT TO ADOPTION.<br>  <br>  Get your baby back|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Honey, you lost your child.  You are never going to get over it.  You need to find someone to talk to, no matter how uncomfortable it is.  It isn't the hormones.  You are separated from your baby, and that is devastating to you.  This has nothing to do with a "medical condition".  Mothers and children have a bond that cannot be broken, even though there is distance and time separating you.  I don't know if you are still in your waiting period before everything gets finalized, but if you want your baby back this is the time to tell someone.  <br>  You really do need professional help.  This isn't going to just "go away".  This is going to hurt forever, and the sooner you can deal with it, the better.<br>  I cannot imagine this loss, and I am going to keep you in my thoughts.  My first mother was your age when she had me and put me up for adoption.|`|C2BLrjCeaa	i am sorry to you. i know how you feel today. And i dont know when you might feel better I hope you do soon. i say time is best and then you will notice friends who dont and they do a bad job as a mom and you will think my baby is lucky to not have a bad mom. i did feel sad for just a while missing the kicks and i had a c-sec so it hurt a long time. but to see my friends keep a babe and make it a little brat with no good life makes me know i did the right thing.|`|FXINmF6saa	You are very young and still have your whole life ahead of you. This was probably for the best in some way because you still run the risk of your baby getting bad parents. Look if you can't be with your baby try and have as much contact as possible with her so that she knows you're there for her. This may be something you will never be able to get over but this is the decision you chose and all you can do now is stay close to her. Just don't do it just because you feel lonely do it because it comes from your heart. If you just miss your baby because you feel lonely try and distract yourself by finding a hobby or go out somewhere with friends. That will take your mind off your your thoughts and depression.|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	"i know its normal to feel sad for a while because of hormones"  <br>  <br>  Who lied to you and told you THIS crap?  For  "WHILE"?  Try "always."  You have an almost 50-50 chance of feeling this for the rest of your life, either as bad or worse.  That's what large-scale studies of surrendering mothers have shown.  The agency or lawyers that brokered your baby for adoption (did you know they may have made $10,000 or more for your baby?) should have told you this.<br>  <br>  Don't think that this is temporary. It is long-lasting and can get worse. In fact even if you are in the lucky half where it does not get worse, it may never get even to "moderate" or "fair" grief resolution. <br>  <br>  You obviously were never told the truth about the magnitude of your loss and how it will permanently affect you with unresolved grief.  You therefore did not give informed consent. <br>  <br>  "A grief reaction unique to the relinquishing mother was identified. Although this reaction consists of features characteristic of the normal grief reaction, these features persist and often lead to chronic, unresolved grief. CONCLUSIONS: The relinquishing mother is at risk for long-term physical, psychologic, and social repercussions. Although interventions have been proposed, little is known about their effectiveness in preventing or alleviating these repercussions." Journal of Obstetric, Gynecological and Neonatal Nursing, 1999 Jul-Aug. pp.395-400.<br>  <br>  45% of mothers surveyed stated that their sense of loss had intensified over the period since surrender and 6.4% stated it had remained the same.  For the sample as a whole, this loss remains constant for up to 30 years. - Winkler, Dr. R.; and Van Keppel, M. (1984)<br>  <br>  All had unresolved grief, continuing to experience symptoms of mourning at the anniversary of the relinquishment. -- Rynearson, E. K. (1982)<br>  <br>  Feelings of sadness and depression at the time of the surrender were rated on average as between “intense” and “the moist intense ever experienced. .. For 67%, these feelings either stayed the same or intensified in the years since surrender, they did not diminish. - Condon, Dr. J. T.(1986)<br>  <br>  Mothers’ scores averaged in the mild to moderate range of depression at the time of the study, which was done a number of years post-surrender, significantly higher than the population average.. Indicates that surrender can lead to long-lasting depression.  40% were still experiencing at least moderate acute grief. - Weinreb, M. (1991)<br>  <br>  <br>  Natural mothers registered significantly stronger symptoms than mothers whose babies had died in 8 of the 14 bereavement subscales, especially for open adoptions . .. Relinquishing mothers have more grief symptoms than women who have lost a child to death, including more denial; despair, atypical responses; and disturbances in sleep, appetite, and vigor. - Blanton, T., & Deschner, J. (1990)<br>  <br>  *** Note this last study: *especially for open adoptions.*  *** <br>  <br>  (The one study showing better grief resolution used an artificial and closely monitored agency situation and even in this study VERY few mothers experienced good grief resolution.)<br>  <br>  These are the studies your agency is fully aware of.  If they did not tell you, then they committed fraud.<br>  <br>  What could make you feel better?  The only thing that can is getting your baby back.  There IS tons of support out there for you:  scholarships for single moms, daycare while you work and go to school, parent resource centers. etc.|`|kBp9IzQqaa	A therapist.  Maybe meeting other teens in your situation.  Visit your child?  It's normal to feel that way.  Just cry if you want to, scream if you want, you have every right.  I am sorry, but definitely try to see her.|`|JPBh5WT3aa	My heart breaks for you.  I know how much you are hurting inside, and how much you miss your baby.  With hormones raging on top of that, it has to be very difficult and isolating for you.  <br>  <br>  You are grieving.  You gave up your child.  It is a huge loss.  One that you will never completely overcome.  Allow yourself to grieve.  It is totally natural to miss your baby.  There is nothing wrong with you, if you didn't feel this loss, you would not be human.<br>  <br>  Our society doesn't recognize this as a loss......and leaves you hanging with no support.  Truly, the agency or whoever orchestrated this adoption should be providing unbiased one on one counseling for you.  You really shouldn't be alone in this.....and I wish you would consider some counseling.  <br>  <br>  Also, know that you should legally still have time to reverse this and get your baby back.  If you are having regrets, they are not going to go away, they will most likely get worse as time passes.  If you want your baby back, you need to move quickly.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, be good to yourself and I hope you will find some kind of peace.  <br>  <br>  For grief, there are books you can read, and you will find similarities.  There are support groups online.  Email me and I can send you some info.  <br>  <br>  And there are people like me that would happy to give you a shoulder.  Please, feel free to email me. I know how you feel.  <br>  <br>  My prayers are with you.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Not sure what can make you feel better....avoid alcohol and medication.

I'm sure it is incredibly hard. Maybe if you don't like shrinks there is a family friend you can talk to? I would think hormones are having an effect on you, but giving up a baby is incredibly hard and don't let people pressure you to forget it and move on. Some of the answers on here are pretty harsh, but even an online friend might be helpful to you, if they've been through something like this. However they should be compassionate, not judgemental and mean. I'm much older, and an adoptive mom, so don't have any kind of similar experience that I can directly relate to yours. If you have a good doctor you may want to talk to them too, or call the adoption agency and see if they have any kind of network of women in your situation that you might be able to talk to. I hope you find the support you need to deal with everything that is going on in your life right now.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Dear Heather<br>  There are some support groups when you go to www.cafemom.com for first parent like yourself.  There are various groups, and sometimes, you can private message individuals there, especially moderators, who have placed before, and can offer support.  There are also some wonderful yahoo.com groups from the yahoo.com page, you can search for them.   With these groups, you need to be careful as with any on-line function, and don't give out personal information.<br>  <br>  As an adoptive mom, I know that having the opportunity to raise a child is the most wonderful experince ever, when one is ready to raise a child, emotionally, mentally, physically, and financially.  I pray you've asked for open adoption, so that way you can have contact with the baby in the future.  In some states, you could still revoke the adoption rights, and work with someone who has the capacity to enter into an open adoption.  We have one with our son's first parents, and update her regularly, and offer for her to visit the baby (or us go see her) anytime she wishes.  First dad and his family do.  I think it's healthier for the child in the long run if the parents can work together.  I wish you peace on this journey, and like any loss, it's very, very hard to deal with, but time does make it easier.  Keep a scrapbook of what you are doing in life as you go, so one day, your reunion will be good.  Let her know how much you love her in the book, take pictures of her dad, and yourself, and of every event in your life, such as your prom, graduation, your wedding in the future, your first house, and let her know what you're thinking as you journalize in the scrapbook.  It's not only normal to feel sad because of hormones, but even without them, sadness over losing a child is tremendous.  Good luck!

Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  PS: Its usually cheaper to buy the stroller/car seat combo when purchasing an infant seat. Best of luck!|`|thoMmZAvaa	Get the infant seat too. Being able to leave the baby in it's seat is one of the most convienient and easy ways to get around during the first three months of life. If the baby is sleeping (which is what they do for the first few months most of the time) having to remove him/her from his seat to his stroller or sling can/will wake him/her up. It'll be warmer by the time you deliver, but it's also great for keeping the baby warm and also out of the sun. It's worth the money you spend on it (and can always buy one used if you don't want to spend full price).<br>  <br>  Military is right, they won't let you out the door without seeing a car seat, I think they're actually obligated by law to make sure your prepared to transport him/her in a legal/safe manner. They may have someone who's responsibility it is to check your carseats positioning, I remember being approached in the hospital during my second pregnancy for this reason|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I got a travel system, so it came with an infant car seat that will hold the baby up to 32 in ad 32 lbs. I really like that I can take her in her car seat with me. I think that if you re getting a stroller anyways a travel system is the way to go since for a little bit more in price you get 2 thing.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	While the convertible does say 5 lbs+ the infant seat does come in handy for at least 6 or more months. You can easier transfer baby without waking him or her, it's easy to take into stores and restaurants and can act as a place for them to sleep when very young and you go to visit people. <br>  <br>  Get the infant seat... you will have so many opportunities and situations where it will be a great help and asset.|`|8WRnqs08aa	Since you are a social person, as I am, It would be so much easier on you to start with an infant car seat. I love being able to take baby out of the car without waking her. The car seat fits right into her stroller too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mother of 4 beautiful children with Twins due 09/10/09|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I was given both. The convertible one is so annoying! It's really bulky and long. It doesn't fit in the rear facing position. <br>  <br>  I am saving that for when she is over 22lbs. in the forward facing position. I prefer the infant for infantcy.<br>  <br>  I drive a regular 4 door car.|`|AA10458750	That's a good question....I am getting my lists ready too. Most friends have recommended the infant seat that attaches to the stroller as well and then as time progresses, you can get a different one.
1ezYfkX7aa	I dont think that you should have a baby shower only for your first baby....i think if you want have one for each. Each baby is a blessing and no one has to go out and buy top of the line things over again such as a crib and furniture. Its a day to celebrate the birth of new life again.....just get the girls together....have lunch, play some games and open presents. Goodluck and congrats =)|`|drp30rf5aa	I have always attended baby showers for friend's babies regardless of how many children they already had.  A baby demands a lot and people generally want to give what they can to the baby and help mom and dad.  At many baby showers there are items requested that aren't really necessary at all and perhaps at the third child's baby shower it might be appropriate to just request what is necessary.  Advertisers would have us believe that we must have hundreds of special items that we can't live without for our babies.  We all know this isn't true so maybe you could have a diaper shower or diapers and formula or jammies and onsies or things of that nature - not just decor or frivolous things for the baby.  People will still buy presents because they like to buy things for a baby - at least I do.|`|AA11987492	Sure! Every baby deserves to be celebrated. If you feel akward asking for gifts, or if you don;t need them, you could have a diaper shower, raise money for a charity in your childs name, add to a college fund, or just have a party with no gifts at all.<br>  <br>  Personally, I love any excuse to buy baby stuff, so I don't care if she is having her 8th kid, she is getting a gift.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	I see nothing at all wrong with having a shower for baby #3. Especially when you have gotten rid of all your previous baby stuff. A third baby is just as much a celebration and joy as a first baby in my book and I think  it's only right that you have a shower for it's arrival!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	What is baby number 3 not as important as baby number 1?<br>  Besides Safety Standards have changed over the last 4 years so had you still had products from your youngest child, they wouldn't be up to standards anyway.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	our family like rule is if you have a boy and your on number 2 and its a girl then we have another shower, if its another boy.. sorry mama...<br>  <br>  but everyone is diffrent.|`|TCJQEUbXaa	It is a celebration of the baby, but instead of a shower, why not have a baby party after the birth - unless there are things like a crib that you expect to get and need right away.|`|B7iSU8UYaa	Absolutely! A baby shower is meant to celebrate a new baby, no matter the number of children.|`|1iOsKZvIaa	Why not? Treat every child fairly!
Yl3C9svGaa	There is a car seat called Sunshine Kids Radian Car Seat. <a href="http://www.elitecarseats.com/Sunshine-Kids-Radian.pro" rel="nofollow">http://www.elitecarseats.com/Sunshine-Ki...</a><br>  <br>  These are expensive, but they are forward/rear facing, and can fit 3 across in the backseat. It can be used for a newborn as a rear facing car seat. They are very skinny - I had a friend that had 2, and I couldn't believe the size difference between this one and the one in my car.<br>  <br>  You may be able to find smaller booster seats for the preschoolers, then use a regular size infant seat if you prefer a carrier rather than one that stays in the car permanently. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	i dont think you are going to fit 2 boosters and a infant seat in that car darling. Maybe its time to trade it in for something that has a bigger back seat. Lots of affordable, good family cars out there.|`|KWaTVVpGaa	Time to get an SUV!|`|geuF7GsHaa	you should go with the sunshine that is brilliant!|`|e0xpYnv1aa	You'd be suprised, pretty much any carseat will fit, A friend of mine also has a grand am, and she has a 3 year old son and twin infant daughters and it all fits in the backseat.|`|AA12145826	KM was right on the money with that car seat link. My best friend has a 6yr old, 2 yr old, and a 3 week old and she has to fit them all in the back of a Nissan Sentra. These seats are awesome and totally fit. Yes, they're a little expensive, but the good news is that you can use them from birth until the child is 65 lbs. That means you'll get at least 5-6 yrs out of the one for your newborn! Show me another car seat that can do that AND can fit 3 across in the back of a compact car.
S2V32ws4aa	If you took the pill within 72hrs you should be fine.  The sooner you take it after unprotected sex the more effective it is.. On day one, 95% of pregnancies are prevented, compared with 85% on the second day, and 60% for those starting on the third day. This also might throw off your cycle so dont be alarmed if your a week late.  Good luck!|`|8UujqaV0aa	yes the plan b will work and i would highly suggest that if neither of you are ready for a baby get on birth control hun. there are so many out there for you to choose from. because believe me it only takes one time to get pregnant.trust me i know, i got pregnant with my second child in only 1 month, and my first was 3 months. so sex without protection or birth control is playing with fire.|`|bnNcPAknaa	Your should of got the day after pill .<br>  Theres' a chance you are pregnant, just take a test ..|`|hdTB8uiMaa	take a test and you will know if you are or not.|`|uuHPneEcaa	The only time it won't work is if ur already pregnant. (i think). I guess u will know when ur period is due and never comes.<br>  <br>  Next time use protection or get on birthcontrol so u won't have to take any type of pills.|`|wdntZl92aa	That stuff works with some people, and others it doesn't.  So theres a risk for you .|`|uLeXGHnKaa	Plan B is pretty effective if you take it within 24 hours of sex, yeah it's not 100% but neither is ***** control! I don't think you have anything to worry about.|`|mCbChkKraa	Will not work, however, the pregnancy probability is lower than 1 %.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	If you have intercourse, you could be pregnant. That's a fact.|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	It should.
8O0S5L2maa	dont tell people u are trying it is none of there buisness, its funner anyway to just tell them ur pregnant when it comes time then they cant also try and talk u out of it.|`|vigFmfLmaa	People will always lecture you in life.  You will always be younger, less responsible, less experienced, etc than someone at pretty much everything.  Then when you do have kids, jeez, what unsolicited advice you will get 24/7.  You just have to be adult enough to brush it off and don't let it get you riled.  If the two of you have planned, budgeted and you feel ready, then what other people say is of no consequence.
B7iSU8UYaa	I had a "bubbles" party for my son when he turned one. We had a small  automatic bubble machine for the kids (or older kids volunteering to blow bubbles) and champagne for the adults to celebrate surviving the first year. We decorated with helium balloons and had a cookout. It was easy, cheap and fun.<br>  <br>  To save money, avoid any type of trademarked theme or character, since the plates, decoration etc get expensive.|`|wHOQXToHaa	I have a boy, but my girlfriend gave her daughter turning one a "circle" party. The cake was round, the balloons were round, she got polk-a-dotted plates, round napkins, etc. It was SOOO super cute and EXTREMELY easy to plan. For my son's 2nd bday next month he is obsessed w/Curious George (which is hard & expensive to find) so I am just throwing a monkey party.|`|208df14c1c172475a19e62bb54d07a28aa	While you need to pick a theme once you do that it easy to save. Like for example I'm give you ways to save 1st then i'll give you theme ideas. Ok to save a lil money you can have it at home(and buy hot dogs, chips and juice or look into a pizza party).Now if you dont plan to have to many people and you hate to clean up then you can look into a party at a kiddie place because most places go by the number of kids you invite. Im not sure where you live but this year i plan to take my boys to a hotel resort called key lime cove it's in gurnee il. and the prices are good i'm doing a over night but they have party packages starting at $34.<br>         Ok for Theme you can do Princess, lula(you know hawaii) pretty in pink, angels stuff like but keep in mind this is her 1st birthday so don't go too crazy a lil color here and there goes a long way and if you just do the family thats even better and cheaper turn it into a family together with a cake, ice cream and ballons(TRUST ME THATS all your 1yr old needs) is your best way to go thats what i did for my son 1st he love it and then he went to sleep and it was adult time good luck. oh And to make it a little less stress remeber 2 things IT'S ABOUT THE BABY keep it simple she won't remeber this party expect for the pictures. And 2nd LET YOU LITTLE angel SLEEP!!! right before the party esp. if you plan to go out it wont be pretty if you dont.|`|5ZdB5K6Raa	I had a bbq for my daughter at the park when she turned one! I did this so i wouldnt have a lot of kids running around my house and kids love the park! She had a great time and so did the other kids! plus it was easy and simple and not expensive
AA11764194	Wait until the blood test results comes.. symptoms says she might be pregnant. but can not tell just by reading them<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|vigFmfLmaa	Signs and symptoms are different for everyone - you can't put much stock in them.  The fact that she is late could mean something, then again she could just be late for no apparent reason.  You did the right thing getting the blood test, that will tell for sure.|`|h4UzjZVnaa	Did you not get the answer you wanted the 1st time you asked this question??<br>  Yes. She could possibly be pregnant.|`|jZPv153Jaa	yup shes prego|`|7hOXX00Eaa	Lots of baby dust to you and your partner! I have never been pregnant, although my partner and I are trying to conceive as well! However, My best friend recently was experiencing the same exact symptoms and had 4 negative pregnancy tests. She had a blood test done and found out she was pregnant! About 6 weeks! It sometimes takes longer for different womens hormones to catch. In my opinion, if you receive negative urine tests and she "just feels pregnant" along with other symptoms, a blood test is the best way to go. Good luck!|`|x84MEAv5aa	WOW! I know how exciting this is!<br>  GOOD LUCK TO YOU GUYS!!<br>  Yes, it does sound as if she might be pregnant.. and YES sometimes womans bodies dont created enough Hcg to test positive sometimes until past 6weeks...<br>  <br>  I knew right away with my last because I woke up in the middle of the night with sweat so bad I had to change! I told my husband I was, he said yea ok... <br>  <br>  Sure enough when I did find out I Was 7 weeks and 6 days!<br>  <br>  BABY DUST YOUR WAY!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	She could be but its weird how it doesnt show up on the test,but then again i heard some women dont have enough hcg for it to show on the test,goodluck,let us know what happens tomorrow with the test,thx|`|Sz7cnFRsaa	Yes it sounds like she is pregnant. Congrates if you are and good luck.
drp30rf5aa	It is a little uncomfortable and you need to take it slow the first couple of times.. I never bled at all.  But if you do that is not what the pain is from.  The pain is simply from the size of his penis being fit into an area that has not been stretched at all.  If you've used a tampon of put your finger or anything else in there your hymen is already broken.  Sex is a natural thing and a penis is supposed to go in there so it will be perfectly fine very quickly.  You just need to take it very slowly and make sure there is enough lubrication.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I hurts a lot the first time you have sex. Take it slow and if it does hurt too bad then don't do it.|`|zoyw8CRKaa	I didn't have any pain at all my first time, not everyone does and i think that there is alot of hype about it happening no one i have spoken to said it hurt..... as long as things are done correctly i.e foreplay and perhaps some lube  this should ease it, also if your tense then your muscles will tense up making it painful for entry,<br>  <br>   don't forget the condom!!!! <br>  <br>  P.s do you use tampons? i have heard that this can break your hymen, i would relax about it and don't expect it to hurt coz 9 times out of 10 it wont. xx|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I don't remember anything hurting so I guess either it was so bad that I blocked it from my memory but my I'm willing to bet that its most likely that I don't remember because it didn't hurt.|`|ev671fdkaa	it depends on your pain threshold i guess. don't worry, it's not unbearable or anything, it's fine after like a day.|`|1iOsKZvIaa	I want to know too. :S|`|zBioLZ9Saa	well yea it hurts but not that bad. <br>  and after its popped (the 2nd time you do it) it doesnt hurt at all.<br>  dont worry he sounds like a good guy for not pushing. you<br>  just stay safe.|`|ixR3qfYdaa	I absolutely did not feel a thing. But I may have popped it using a tampon or something. Regardless I did not feel anything|`|oA8fEliTaa	well at first if he takes it easy it will hirt a small bit whilst he starts off but when your broken in its great and you just get pleasure make sure hes easy on you though !!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|T5X64Mraaa	It didn't hurt it was more uncomfortable,|`|os5IKFBJaa	I didn't feel a thing.|`|5lt9NV2yaa	Its different for every girl, personally it did her for me until about the third time, but speaking to my friends about it some say they didn't feel a thing others say it hurt a bit, so you won't know until you actually do it! Take it slowly for your first time, at your own pace, don't be pressured! You have to get used to something being there and allow your skin to stretch. You may also bleed the first time and maybe the second too, but it will clear up quickly! The bleeding is caused by the breaking of the hymen, which is a thin membrane inside the vagina. There's only a tiny bit of blood that comes out, although it may look a lot to you don't worry, again everyone is different you may not even bleed at all!<br>  The hymen is a stretchy tissue and using a tampon rarely breaks it, although it is possible.<br>  Also always use a condom, even if you are on the pill, there are sexually transmitted diseases out there and you can't tell who has one just by looking!<br>  Good luck!
EMKuBql8aa	You would be suprised what kids can live off of, lol. <br>  <br>  Try to cut off snacks dramatically for a couple days and only offer real food. It's probably just a phase, the more attention you pay to it, the longer it'll last cause he sees that it bugs you and likes your reactions, give it none and he'll get bored eventually.<br>  <br>  this will make you smile and see that you aren't the only one with these issues:<br>  <a href="http://www.nanceestar.com/KidsToddlerDiet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nanceestar.com/KidsToddlerDie...</a>|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	he will in time give pediasure for now|`|cpLoD9NJaa	I was and am still going through the same thing, my child is 22 months.  When she started on table food all she would eat are those little hot dog wieners.  Now, she only eats Peanut butter sandwiches, fruit, chicken nuggets, applesauce, yogurt, and waffles.  That's it!  I stressed so much about it, and my Pediatrician said quit stressing.  Kids are usually picky up until they are 5.  Just keep offering the food.  If you look up things on the internet, you will find it is quite common for kids to be stuck on certain foods.  I try to be creative when serving different foods, but she just isn't interested.  I think what I might try is pureeing different things and sneaking them into her yogurt and applesauce.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there, I know exactly how you feel!!  You aren't alone, believe me!|`|fuBJzxaCaa	try mac and cheese, don't force and honest....my son will be two next month and he still rather have a sippy cup and a cheese stick than an egg or PBJ.

But make sure you give him some pediasure so he won't be malnutritioned

Fsr2Rofzaa	hun, take another 1.  Sometimes after a test sits for a bit a negative test will start to show a second line.

WlU3NFu6aa	Most babies are like taht. they move a lot at night caus during the day you are on the go and the motion pacifies them and they sleep. So at night when we are calm and resting, baby wakes up. Also since you are moving more during the day, maybe you cant feel all the little movements she makes. <br>  <br>  A lot of babies have day and night confused when tehy are first born. Mine did. It passes after about a week|`|SNVauR3laa	Babies move more when you are still because when you are moving, the movement puts them to sleep. This doesn't mean anything about her sleep patterns once she is born. I will tell you, that chances are, you won't get much sleep when she comes. But, that's ok. Mother's bodies can take sleep deprivation, and it doesn't last forever. Enjoy your baby, and good luck.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Most babies in utero do this, it's because we are moving around most of the time during the day. When we settle down we feel them moving around more because we are calm and they think it's time to play lol. When we are moving around a lot during the day it sort of calms them down. <br>  Most babies when they are first born will sleep all the time. They wake up only briefly to get changed and eat, then fall right back asleep. That's the way my 3 kids were when they were new borns at least.... Most of the time they all have their days and nights mixed up, and for about the first month or two..more than likely you will to!|`|cv0foxlTaa	Most pregnant women will find that their baby moves more at night... that's because during the day all of your walking and other activities will normally lull baby to sleep.  Most babies will have their days and nights confused when they are newborns.  I remember being 8-9 mos preggo and having insomnia and DS was kicking, kicking, kicking and I was thinking "if I could just have this baby, I'll finally get some sleep."  LOL!  <br>  <br>  Best of luck and congrats!!|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	They tend to stick to their schedule when they are born. at least in my experience. My daughter had NO periods of rest when I was pregnant with her, and she didn't sleep for 4 months. (she also had allergy problems and had bronchitis at 4 Weeks.) <br>  It could also be that during the day you are just moving around so much you don't really feel the baby move! Good Luck!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Lol, all newborns have their days and nights confused for some time so it's normal for them to be awake more at night and sleep more during the day. Sorry, but that's part of being a parent!<br>  <br>  She'll work them out on her own so just sleep when she does at first.
Q0xm1Kodaa	There is a lot you need to worry about. If you are a full time student then you can still be under your parents insurance if not than you dont have any of that. If you have a car you need gas money, insurance, money in case it breaks down. You are going to need money for groceries, phone, rent, heat, electric. The list goes on and on.

Basically, depending on how long you're intending on being there, you need clothes for sure...make sure you bring stuff to do, I left alot of things at home because I was too lazy to pack all my stuff and when I got here and was home alone all day I was usually bored. If you have a laptop or computer I'd def. bring it, or buy one if you don't.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	1.  Be prepared to split the money you two make in half to pay the bills.<br>  2. Be prepared for the adjustment to living with someone outside of your family.  Trust me, it hits you like a ton of bricks once it starts lol.  There may be certain things the two of you do that drive eachother batty. <br>  3.

I know that's not the happy rainbows and flowers perspective but it's the real life perspective.<br>  4.  Figure out where the nearest hospital is.  Find out where the police station and fire department are.  Find out where your grocery stores and other shopping areas are.  Figure out where the good mechanics are if you have a vehicle.|`|mDt03eXIaa	Well you need to be prepared for it not to work out, for starters. living together, the stress of finances, etc can put a huge strain on even the best of relationships. be prepared to miss your old town, family and friends. If you don't know anybody and he does, there might be issues of you feeling neglected while he goes out to hang with his friends, and you're stuck at home. Do you have your own transportation, or will you be relying on him to drive you to and from work/school/whatever? Basically, it's going to be a huge adjustment for both of you, so expect there to be some rough patches. <br>  <br>  Also, you;re oing to need to look into medical insurance if your parents plan won't cover you, if you have a vehicle you may need to transfer the insurance into your name if it isn't already, you'll need to discuss with him whether or not he's going to add your name to the lease on wherever he's living.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Don't burn your bridges behind you.<br>  Don't piss off your parents.<br>  <br>  At your age, these things usually do not last.  you have about a 95% chance of breaking up within the next 3 years.  If you get married, there is a 75% chance you will be divorced within 5 years.<br>  <br>  Don't piss people off, so that you have someplace to come home to when this relationship goes sour.<br>  <br>  For God's sake DON'T get pregnant until AFTER you are married!

It'd be one thing had he been in his 20's or you were forceably raped, quite another to decide that in your "adult point of view".  It seems more like teenage payback than adult maturity if you try to pull anything now.  He could be I suppose but seeing as no charges were brought and you all dealt with it, a judge would be hard pressed to file.<br>  <br>  Dead beat or not, decisions were made by 2 teenagers, not a 14 year old and a mature adult that lead to the creation of your child.  Do you want to tell your daughter, "Mommy decided she was tired of him being a dead beat so she had your daddy tossed in the slammer for statutory rape"?|`|EMKuBql8aa	Nothing will probably happen, but there is always a possibility. It all really depends on your states laws and the statue of limitations. Some states it is 2 years, some it's 10 years, google the laws and see what you can find.<br>  <br>  The 1st person is wrong. No, your parents aren't the one that has to complain, that is wrong. You can do it. <br>  <br>  But, morally whether you should do it or not is another question..... you did go 7 years and was fine, don't ruin someone's life out of anger.|`|8WRnqs08aa	Statue of Limitation is One Year in California.

And now that it is 7 years later, the courts might not grant you a hearing. Try to consult a lawyer, or call your local police department for information.|`|TuRO6QHlaa	That is sort of messed up, I mean sure it is wrong in the first place, but now you want him to go to jail have a record and never be able to get a real job? Sounds to me like he has something you want|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I think your parents would have to be the ones to prosecute, don't worry and just call an attorney for a free consultation to be safe!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|PUC5ECoIaa	Tell your attorney know that piece of information. It's kinda hard because it was long ago (7years). Good luck|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	honestly, although I think that he probably did take advantage of you at 14, I think it's been too long to bring it up now. I know you feel that looking back, you see it differently, however you didn't see it that way then. You made a bad judgement call at a young age and that sucks. But I think you're really angry that despite how young you were, you stood up and took responsibility and he did not. <br>  <br>  I was 16 when I got pregnant with my twin daughters and they are 12 years old now and I still have yet to collect one penny of child support from their deadbeat loser biological father. I've been angry about it, but eventually you just have to stop bring mad and just accept that he's a p.o.s. Then you just move on and be glad that he's not teaching your child to be just like him. Because if he was in her life, chances are that's what she'd be learning. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't hesitate to mention it in front of the judge though, that you were 14 and he was 18 and took advantage of you and got you pregnant and then left you to take care of it all on your own. It certainly can't hurt your case. <br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	no. statuate of limitations. and you would have had to press charges now since you are no longer a minor anyway.<br>  <br>  and i agree. that is screwed up. but he will probably have to pay back support.<br>  <br>  no you want the support for 7 years for YOU. don't lie. you found out from a friend that you could do this for quick cash and decided to do it.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You'd have to look up the statute of limitations for prosecuting something like that. May be different from state to state.
ZusC87WBaa	NEVER, never, never would I leave a young child alone in my vehicle while I went inside any place, no matter what the length of time.  One of the reasons I only use pay at the pump....everything else can wait.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	I live in the city, there is no way I would ever leave her unattended - I don't even leave my purse in the car, let alone Elyse!  <br>  <br>  I always just pay at the pump and forget the drink...|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I take all three of my girls in when we go to the gas station or where ever else. <br>  <br>  I have seen people leave their kids in the cars at the gas station and even at wal-mart. When I see kids in the cars at either place I call the cops because you never know what could happen to those kids. In the summer it gets pretty hot here and one time I saw a little girl maybe 3 in the back seat of this car and it was probably 85 degrees outside and all the windows were rolled up so I called the police and they came. Luckily the little girl wasn't hurt.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	Like most everyone else, I always bring her in with me.  Never would I leave her in the car.  I wouldn't be able to live with myself if something happened to her!  I also pay at the pump, always!|`|a2134372f454ba425d7b423ac42d1ed2aa	Absolutely|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I always take my son in with me. I have to many fears about someone stealing the car with him in it.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Yes, I take my daughter in with me. I would never leave her in the car alone. I'm not taking a risk like that!|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I haven't got gas since my son was born nearly 6 months ago! Lol. We go out of town every other weekend and we fill up on gas before coming home so I don't have to get gas.. Gosh, it's going to be weird when I start pumping gas again! lol<br>  <br>  Anyways the other morning my hubby took Wyatt with him to get donuts and stoped to get gas before coming home. When I found out he got gas I said "You took Wyatt in right?" And he said no!! I almost freaked! We have the little automatic thing that locks and unlocks our car and he said he took it off the keyring and locked the car before going in and he parked in front of the door.. But it still scares me and I believe it's illegal.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I do take Lilly in with me but I always try to pump gas when I'm alone or have my hubby to do it. While it is a bit of a hassle, it pales in comparison to someone kidnapping her or hitting my car. I actually had one man at a gas station tell me that he was proud I had brought my baby in even if it was just to pay for my gas. I wouldn't think to do anything else|`|9X09kM4oaa	I always will take my baby in with me where ever I may go. Babies are the most precious cargo you will ever have.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I don't run into the gas station, but I do leave him in the car if I'm only going to be less than a 2-3 minutes and I either have a clear view of him from where I'm at and can easily watch, or if it's in my driveway.<br>  <br>  I have no qualms about leaving him in the car while I run back into the house to pick something up that I forgot.  Even though I can't see the car from everywhere in my house, we live at the end of a private drive, which means that any person who could cause problems would have to already be on our property when I get there, or would be heard as they come onto the property. <br>  <br>  I also don't have too many problems leaving him in the car while I run into the ATM, since I can very easily see him the entire time and can monitor what's happening.<br>  <br>  We were all having a bad night last night, so my toddler and I ran to Jamba Juice.  They have huge plate windows and I was able to park right outside the door.  I went in, ordered our jambas while watching what was happening with the car, then went back out to the car to sit while they prepared the jambas.  I watched so when they were done I could run back in and pick them up.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	I take them in if i ever have to. Before my second son was born, I always took my 3 yr old in. Now days, I just use a credit/debit card to get gas so i don't have to lag both of them in with me... gah.. I hope I never have to! I'll stick with my cards for now... lol.. But I'd never ever leave both of them in the car alone. Not even for a minute.|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Yes, I would be too afraid. Yesterday I got him in the car and thought to myself "did I turn off the stove?'. So I took him out of the car and ran back in the house. He was in the car in my driveway...but I am way to scared these days. My parents always left me and my brother in the car, but now i think thats considered abuse.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	One time, when my son was just born... I left him in the car while I ran in to get milk.<br>  <br>  I spent the entire (long and terrible) 3 minutes in that store sweating like I stole something.<br>  <br>  Never ever again would I do that.  You're right - the "what ifs" are endless.|`|AA11109728	Yes, I have always done that.  Most of the time I try to go get gas on my lunch break at work so I can avoid having to take my daughter in, but if I have to go when she's with me I have always taken her in.  Anything can happen, and I'm not willing to risk it.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	Anytime we've been at the gas station. I go in and pay for the gas while my husband stays in the car. Or vice versa. But by myself @ the store etc I always take Jeffrey out of the car and in with me. He's to precious to lose!|`|4iXL4C6paa	Yes I always take them in with me wherever we are and I have four I have to get out an haul around but I usually try to run my errands when my husband is home so I can leave the kids at home with him.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Wow! Why wouldn't you? Every single day multiple times a day children especially babies are stolen. I wouldn't wish that on anyone, and would never risk it happening to me!|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Usually, the only thing I stop at the Gas Station for is Gas.<br>  <br>  I always Pay with my Debit Card Outside of the store at the pump So I can leave her in the car and Im just right outside of the car pumping gas so I can see everything shes doing....I don't buy gas unless its with a Debit Card so I dont have to take her out. <br>  <br>  But, if for some reason I have to Pay in the store, or get something else, Yes, I do take her in with me. Im like you- To many "What if's" runs through my head. You never know what might happen with the kind of sick world were living in today!|`|FAGI8owFaa	yes. never leave alone|`|7N4AtRogaa	We are very fortunate in my town that everything has drive-thrus and full service centers; including our gas stations and banks, and even some grocery stores.  It's very convenient when you have a sleeping baby in the car to utilize these.  I don't like the thought of leaving my little girls in the car even if i'm only a few feet away.|`|fq1QD8gnaa	This is a godd question...although I personally woudl not leave my baby in the car alone while I was paying for gas and like someone else said I do believe that is child neglect. I do leave my baby in the car at home alone sometimes If I am getting ready to leave somewhere and I have to go back in the house to get something, but of course I leave the car door open and stuff, but I also live in a quiet very family oriented cul de sac so I dont worry too much about strangers. I use pay at the pump when my baby is with me to avoid having to get her out and stuff but what crossed my mind when I do that is what if something happens and theres some kind of gass explosion or the car blows up and my baby is still in there, I know its a very slim chance that can happen, but then if I take my baby out and hold in one hand while pumping she will small all the fumes and stuff and thats not good either.....and I may be being a bit extreme. But basically I think every parent has their own personal views, but we also have to follow the law|`|ErXKMHGAaa	I take both my kids in, my 15 month old and my 5 year old. It may be a hassle, but if you can avoid the possibility of someone kidnapping your kids while stealing your car, why even question it?

If it is too much of a hassle to take her in (sleeping, etc.) then I just won't stop.

I also have all these scary scenarios running trough my head.  If I have to walk just a few feet (5)  to pay I would leave her in a locked car.

The two older children wanted to donate their piggy bank savings to a bell ringer outside of walmart to the salvation army.  She pulled up one car length away from the bell ringer, left her baby in the car because it was raining, and then walked her children up to the bell ringer, someone saw this, called CPS on her and reported her, she was arrested and they were investigated for something as minor as that.  <br>  <br>  I won't even return a shopping cart to the cart holder without my son in my arms.

Now, I have a baby of my own and it freaks me out to leave her with people, let alone in the car by themselves.  I agree that there are too many "what ifs"  Did you hear about the woman in Texas I think, anyways, she left her baby in the car for just a minute to run into the store, and someone stole her car! With the baby inside!  She was devastated, but she was still charged with negligence.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: when I was 6 and 7 my dad used to tell my mom he was taking me to the park, and we would go to the bar instead.

It's funny, because my mom used to leave all of us kids while she'd go into the convenience store, and when we got older, she would go shopping for antiques and leave us in the car if we refused to come.  I think things have changed a lot, because I couldn't do that.  Even though the area I live is very safe, people are likely to call the cops unless you are literally within direct line of sight of your child.<br>  <br>  The most I have been able to do is leave her asleep in her crib while I am downstairs out front of my building with the monitor for like three minutes...and even that makes me feel anxious.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	I take her in or out where ever I go.

E6T9DPT9aa	It's probably because of the fact that they are somewhat more 'old-fashioned' than other parents (if you get me.) Why not go out for a walk? Or sit in the garden? <br>  <br>  I personally would let my daughter in her room with her boyfriend, but I'd tell her to leave the door open and check on them like hourly - bringing drinks etc (secretly making sure they're not doing any thing naughty.)<br>  <br>  Tell your parents that you wouldn't do anything and ask for their trust to be placed in you.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you don't abuse their trust!<br>  <br>  Other than that, I think it's due to how they were brought up, and how modernisation has taken place really. They may have different views on life as they are older, and they are probably wiser. Also, it could be from their own experience of being alone in room with a lover and their goings on.<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|qR3MYSOIaa	No, I got pregnant in my boyfriend's (now husband) basement with his whole family sitting upstairs, when I was 16.

As far as I'm concerned, anything you want to do with your boyfriend at that age, you can do in the common areas of the house, or out in public. <br>  <br>  If you really want to keep it at "just kissing" for the next three years, believe me, the only way to accomplish that is to not spend much time alone together behind closed doors.<br>  <br>  So far they have not told you that you can't have your boyfriend in your room with the door open, even though your dad doesn't like it. So don't push it. This privilege will probably end in an instant if your dad see you guys making out, or if he likes your next boyfriend less than this one.|`|PqcEjB0Oaa	Well my parent let my friend and her boyfriend be alone in MY room.

They never did anything, and didnt appear to have a problem with it. ALthough, when my dad went to bed(my friend was spending the night and her boyfriend was there until 1 am) he said he had to go.

I don't think any teenagers would even try having sex in a house full of people with the door open.<br>  <br>  I would be concerned about having the door closed and being left alone at home.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	No I wouldn't let my sis to stay in her room alone with her boyfriend it is just not correct, you start kissing but one thing lead to another and before you know you may be in a situation you may feel uncomfortable about.|`|cljrVTpiaa	I dont see the problem I hate it when every adult on this site paints every bloody teenager with the same brush. I'm 15 years of age and i have a 16 year old boyfriend and yes we do mess aout but i aint ready for sex and not every teenager in society is thinking of sex every 3 seconds you no there is some of us who are responsile who mess about but we dont have intercourse so whats the big deal!!<br>  Right now my rants over i think that i would let my child bring boys into our house and let them have the door shut at 13 however id warn her and i would definately not be happy if she got pregnant but come on if you tell teenagers not to do anything they aill want to do it even more so i dont think restrictions is what teenagers need its freedom to make their own mistakes and deal with the consequences and then adults may realise that not all teenagers want sex!|`|eWjxwNucaa	I think that some people would have a bit more faith in teenagers these days.<br>  <br>  I think it would be best if you introduced your boyfriend to your dad and your mum. Because it may be they trust you but are not sure of the boy.<br>  <br>  In all honesty i think it depends on the two teenagers themselves. If they are responsible and mature i would think it fine to go to the bedroom as thats where usually the computer and video games are ;]!<br>  <br>  However i do think there is a point where some parents should say no as the two teens may not be all that mature.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell it depends on the teens themselves.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	No I wouldn't allow it. There are way to many teens out there having sex WAY before they should! Pregnancy rates are already outrageous.|`|4iXL4C6paa	sorry honey but that is a big NO for me.....I wasn't even allowed to have a boyfriend at 13 lol<br>  <br>  I am 25 so Im not old either|`|AA10910187	It depends on how the guy is.  If all he wants to do is 'it' than no, but if its innocent LOVE than ya its fine!|`|7mKNHl2zaa	it should be a matter of trust for them. do they trust you wont go doing things with him?|`|wqRwSaGSaa	its the fact that you shouldnt be alowed because you are so young.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	no, i wouldn't.  go outside for a walk.|`|KHI7MB4iaa	Someone answered this question by saying go outside for a walk<br>  If they're out with no parental supervision whatsoever what do you think they'll get up to them?<br>  <br>  It's a lot safer for them to just go up to the bedrom with the door open.<br>  Seriously would you have sex in a small house with a lot of people in it with the door of a room open with your parents downstairs?<br>  I think not.|`|9793bbf489686bd41fae121ef8e2405faa	No!!!|`|hEL8M0rnaa	When i was 13, (5 yrs ago, my parents were 43 and 49) i was only allowed in my room with a boy if i was supervised and had the door opened. Then i thought it was totally horrible, but now looking back im perfectly okay with my parents being that strict. I'm sure they are only looking out for your best interest, they want you to be safe and healthy.|`|jBZJkSjWaa	big fat no... and u too young to be thinking about boys..|`|CrmCHVI0aa	umm NO. your only 13. your parents are right not to let two young teenagers be alone.look at little alfie and his gf, parents at 13 and 15. prob wouldn't of happened if if they had parents like yours. theyre just trying to protect their little girl.|`|a8tCObqraa	hi my name is stacey and i'm 14 (15 in march) the thing is there is so many teen pregnancies now and ur parents don't want that to happen to u and i know what ur thinking oh they should trust me because i'm not like other teenagers but ur parents can't take that risk. my friends mom and dad trusted her and when she was 13 she got pregnant and so many months but when she told her boyfriend who was the same age as her he didn't want to know :( she is now 17 and she has a 3 year old son and a new boyfriend who is 18 she's happy and she wouldn't change her life for the world but she wished she had waited because she didn't do very well on her GCSE's plus she had to have quite a lot of time off school for when her son was ill and when he had to have his needles. she got treated quite badly to when people found out she was pregnant because she was called names, attacked, spat at and other stuff that was quite bad :( today she has to juggle collage, looking after her son and having a part time job at a chippy and if it wasn't for supportive parents she would have to find some where to live and struggle with bills. i really hope this makes u understand why ur parents are being the way they are.<br>  <br>  hope this helps good luck x|`|c2rTAk71aa	girls are more guarded than guys I think for obvious reasons. Women suffer more emotionally if they do end up pregnant. It's hard to be a single mom and do everything on your own. I think your parents are just trying to protect you.<br>  <br>  His mom probably doesn't care b/c maybe she's naive and doesn't think her son would do that. But you never know, accidents happen. <br>  <br>  I think you know who you are and if you say you won't do it and you know your not thats great but parents always rather be safe than sorry so don't be upset with them. <br>  <br>  Someday you will have kids who start dating and you will raise and eyebrown and want to protect them.|`|mNAOyLyraa	I'm 14 (but only just, my B day was a week ago) and if i was a parent, i WOULD let a child my (or our) age go to their room with a boyfriend. If you only kiss that's fine - that's what i do with my boyfriend when we go upstairs. It's just nice being there together and cuddling etc. without feeling self-concious and with family memberes eyes on you both. It's more relaxed in your room. As long as you don't go too far together there n stuff, there's no harm in just being in your room together. <br>  <br>  Parents that have answered this - well, you just don't understand. Just 'cause your daughter is in their room with a boyfriend doesn't mean they're doing anything serious. Give them some slack and trust them, JEEZ!<br>  <br>  End of, haha.|`|sbeoF50gaa	My daughter is only 5, and I"m dreading her teen years. As for your question, no I wouldn't I'm 24 and I remember being a teen very clearly. It's inappropriate for you two to be alone in a bedroom. Do your parents know his mom leaves you two alone?  Your parents care about you and don't want you to make a mistake... If you do decide to have sex sooner than expected just be sure to wear a condom. "Pulling out" doesn't work. guys produce this "lubricant" and it contains sperm. So be careful and understand your parents care about you and what they are saying is for  your own good.|`|wWUV6WERaa	Well, if your door is open I don't see anything wrong with it.|`|HQ5R1p9qaa	well i got pregnant at 14 so i probably shouldnt have been aloud with my bf in his room|`|y1lmY4mXaa	My parents let me and nothing happened.<br>  <br>  <br>  its really just a case of trust.|`|zlCOWbLVaa	I would say 16. The legal age x|`|aOCfLAJJaa	I've been allowed to sleep in the same room with a girl, and we didn't have sex.|`|H2IqzG12aa	Mixed feelings.  My gut reaction is, no.  But my parents and hers let us spend time in each other's bedroom at that age (we also didn't do anything more than kiss).  Not a big deal under your circumstances.  I guess the college rule of keeping "both feet on the floor" would keep everything on the up and up.|`|QGP930C6aa	well i dont have kids (i'm 16) but you sound pretty sensible so i'd probably let you. But your parents are just worrying about you. Just tell them you just want a bit of privacy but not cos your havin sex and that. But if they reall have a problem just go for a walk or somthin|`|2LpWgU20aa	i would let my kid as long as i really trusted the kid and the boyfriend. keep the door wide open and let ur parents know ur exact reasons for going in your bedroom, (just say you want to gossip or something... lol) let ur dad know ur not going to do anything with him.|`|oOMzcKITaa	i wouldnt let my daughter in her boifriends room with the<br>  door closed, but if you say that <br>  theres always someone arooundd and the door is opened<br>  then i dont see the problem :)|`|Jucak0HLaa	Um no,I wouldn't let mine.Have you seen all the pregnant teens lately?|`|C0GeEv7kaa	no, the temptation is always there.|`|6gthdHpnaa	I'm 13 too, and I don't think you should be alone in your room with your boyfriend if your parents don't allow it. They have good reasons. You're lucky you're even allowed to have a boyfriend. I don't even want a boyfriend, but if I did, my parents won't let me have one until I'm 18.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	No.  You can sit downstairs or in the garden if you need privacy.<br>  <br>  If your bedroom was downstairs and in clear view of the house, then yes, but otherwise no.|`|dgRTkccBaa	I think your parents are correct.  It's not appropriate to be alone in your bedroom at your age.  BTW, I'm not old either, I'm 32.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Nope, I wouldn't allow it. There are many other places for 13/14 year olds to hangout, there is no need to be in the bedroom.|`|30ba6b2b18a194d0cef3eda2f3b0e6d6aa	They are obviously more concerned about you than your boyfriend's parents are.  He's not the one who would get pregnant is he?|`|I3CNklLKaa	Why do you need privacy with this boy at only 13 years old?|`|z03coR1Oaa	one word NO! its ok saying we don't do anything except kiss but we all know what kissing can lead to.
71426c90338c6daa00b5005f598c343aaa	I've answered a few of your questions, but yeah, try again, first urine in the morning, I'm looking forward to knowing the result, I'm pretty sure you are after seeing the photos of the tests... And yes, a positive is usually a positive, no doubt!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!  <br>  <br>  K x|`|sAbah6dTaa	a line is a line!!! i found out immediately when i got pregnant before, we took EIGHT tests and there was always a faint line... if it's there within the three minutes (or the time allowed) you're pregnant!!<br>  <br>  congratulations mommy!!|`|ZKm894kfaa	a line is a line.  With both of my pregnancy tests the line was very faint.  Congrats and Best of luck to you!!!|`|4iXL4C6paa	Any time I have ever had a faint line I was pregnant|`|EHQCkDaqaa	Don't drink any soda if you think you are pregnant. you are only allowed to have like 1 can of soda per day, and the first 15-60 days of the pregnancy are the most crucial in terms of formation of body parts & brain functions.. So don't risk it. I would take another test.. Usually if you have a faint line, you have the hormone, but not enough to really make it a positive, either you didn't have the urine in your bladder long enough, or you are very early on, etc.|`|uC4Ofrr0aa	A false positive pregnancy test is when the test says that you are pregnant but actually you are not. This is a one off case and a positive pregnancy test is a pretty good indication that you are pregnant. False positive pregnancy tests are rare - though there are instances and conditions where they can occur.<br>  <br>  HCG pregnancy tests or home pregnancy tests determine pregnancy through the detection of the hormone Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) in a woman’s urine. Doctors recommend that you wait until you have missed a period to take a home pregnancy test. You can take a test 14 days from possible conception. Home tests are usually 97% accurate when all instructions are followed correctly and the results are read on time. Some kits come with two tests so that in case you have made a mistake, you may take the home pregnancy tests gain.|`|89f464125f23406f1f454478beb3ffd9aa	For my first test, it first appeared as a negative. About a minute later, I saw a VERY faint positive line. I was too impatient to wait a couple days to test again, so I took another one that afternoon, and it was a very clear positive.|`|vygYFdsSaa	A faint line is still a positive result. It sounds like its gonna be positive especially because of how diluted the urine was. A line really is a line, lol :) Congratulations!! Let us know how the test goes tomorrow :)|`|i8Y3p9CAaa	i could hardly see my positive line, im now 29 weeks....you should drink low amount of water(a lot of water will make ur pee less potent) and take the test with ur first morning pee, which is the strongest, good luck|`|on3CVSgWaa	"a line is a line" <br>  <br>  If it was that fast, then I say Congrats!!!!|`|AA11114072	A line is line. CONGRATS!!|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	even if there's a faint line, it is still a line. those tests are made to pick up the hcg hormone. they get darker the more hcg there is in the urine. chances are the fmu test will show a darker line. but yes, a line is really a line. retest in the morning and u will know for sure.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	The first test I took this time around was taken pretty early. The test line was so faint it was almost not even a line. I'm now nearly 20 weeks. It's true, if you see a line, no matter how light, it's a positive test. Congrats!!
y6g0RnuAaa	I wouldn't do it- you never know what chemicals will be absorbed in the skin. People just don't think sometimes.|`|n3IoftMFaa	I would only put temporary tattoos on my kids if I had like, quints and had to keep them straight. Right on the forehead.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	That's kind of dumb given that baby's skin is sensitive. Maybe when they are a little older like 2.|`|ArYvBhkpaa	I would never do that to my child.That's so stupid!!|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Wow, I think you and a lot of others are way overreacting.  A temporary tattoo is not gong to hurt the child in any way.  Its something my husband would do if he happened to get one in the cereal box to suprise me when I bathed the kids.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	*lol* At least they can't eat the temporary tattoo unlike the nail polish.<br>  <br>  Not unless its a phone number or medical information I don't see a good reason.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	It's not like it would hurt the baby..... why is this such a big deal to you?<br>  (Not that I ever have, or ever will, put one on my own child)|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I have a friend who has put them on her little girl since she was about 14 months old.  But, it's because her older brother, who is 5 gets them so she throws a fit to get one too.|`|EeGgovyCaa	3 weeks maybe too young, but my babies are 15 months and I put a little sticker tatoo on my son's arm. It was cute!|`|rdFxFeU7aa	i'ev too have seen this and been surprised.<br>  <br>  <br>  But i think its alot better then nail polish and ear piercings. Especially if the tatoo is like a little teddy bear or something.<br>  <br>  1) ear piercings hurt. especially if your a baby<br>  2) nail polish can be toxic, so what if the baby is sucking there fingers and has a little nibble?<br>  <br>  soo as you can see tatoos arnt really that bad. Yes who would want one on there baby anyway? idk|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	the tattoos that stick to your skin with water??? lol good idea im about to get my son one on his arms...lol just kidding|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I can see my husband doing that to be funny.....|`|bf03f3398ae59403fb987824b585b742aa	I think it's a little weird putting a temp tattoo on a baby but I think it's kinda cruel to stick holes in their ears. A choice they should make when they are ready. At least a temp tattoo doesn't hurt.<br>  <br>  Mom to a beautiful tattoo, earing and varnish free baby girl.|`|PuQyYMM8aa	Young, Dumb, and Stupid|`|mVD3TQkFaa	My nephew is a year old and my mom ( his grandmother ) put a little heart on his upper arm that said something like stud or something. It was cute and funny:-) Of course she washed it off ect.. at the end of the day. I would not put a temporary tattoo on a 3 week old though. That is stupid.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	how old was the baby, and what do you mean a temp tat? Like you one you wet and it stick to the skin? That's not so bad its just a sticker without the back part. Maybe somebody gave it ot the kid as a gift or at a restaurant and they just wanted them to have it. Its gonna rub off anyway so its no biggie. i know a guy who got a real tat in middle school. Now that's crazy .|`|nhgQKvwEaa	I wouldn't do that to my baby, but it's not that bad in my opinion. It's just a temporary tattoo, it's going to come off. I think piercing a baby's ears is a lot worse than a stupid little fake tattoo. I've heard far worse.|`|Xc02z608aa	It's a temporary tattoo.  I'd rather see a baby with a temporary tattoo then holes in her ears.  Babies should NOT have earrings, or nail polish.  What's the big deal about a temporary tattoo?|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	My kids always wear those fake tattoos.  They wet their skin stick em on.  I take them off later or they come off in the bath .  Whats the big deal?  Am I missing something?<br>  <br>  Second Opinion:  OHHHH, 3 week old kid.   Yes that's a bit weird. Sorry I misunderstood.|`|4iXL4C6paa	that is so stupid to me...I let me son (6) and my daughter (3) wear the ones the pick out of the treat box at school but I would never go home and slap a spider man tatoo on my 5 month old son lol.|`|8t8NjjnVaa	The only logical explanation is that they are too immature.  They are treating the child like a doll or a toy, not a little human.|`|pCZPtegeaa	Lol... people having babies way too young.<br>  <br>  I take that back. I'm 20 with a 4 month old, and I've never thought of doing that.<br>  <br>  It's people having babies with the maturity level of a 12 year old.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Well thank God it's only temporary. I remember getting those when we were around 7 or 8 at the store. But who'd put it on a baby? Weird.|`|eytlIKITaa	Because the parents are complete idiots!  : ) That's the only logical reason!|`|hKAq9nGBaa	Hmm...<br>  Let's talk about how immature other people are for putting a temporary tatoo on their baby when we put painful holes in baby girls' ears all the time to give the poor little thing pain and the chance of infection.<br>  Baby-dolling our children up are we?<br>  <br>  As for the tatoo.<br>  Logical reason?<br>  I see none.<br>  Maybe it was cute.<br>  If it's not in a place where the baby would have contact too,(wrist, arm, hand, foot, etc.) so that it could ingest the tatoo, why are we worrying about this?<br>  I wouldn't do it to my child but it's the other mothers choice.<br>  It's not like we should nominate her worst mother of the year.<br>  Jeeze.<br>  Mind your own business.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Hmm, I'm missing the big deal of this... When my oldest two were 1 and a half, and 6 weeks, I did it... A fake tattoo on each of them, that my then-7-year-old nephew had brought over for them. :) Why not? Painless, and cute pics of it! Then, I washed it off, very easily.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I don't see what's to be up in arms about.<br>  <br>  (I was 21 at the time, though, and I'm 31, now!)<br>  <br>  *edited* I see babies with their ears pierced, which does cause pain, and is meant to be permanent... I see babies dressed like little gangstas or divas... I see babies with nail polish, their hair all done up (barely any hair, at that), and babies in t-shirts or whatever, with all kinds of sayings on it (some of them not so cool sayings), and parents obviously think that's cute... A temporary tattoo is nothing! If one thing is bashed, I would think it all would be... Just my opinion.|`|kgCHQQshaa	It's temporary.<br>  It's coming off. <br>  <br>  Big deal is... ?|`|OThwE3Whaa	What does it matter?<br>  <br>  It's not hurting the child or anybody else.  I don't mean to sound rude, but why are you concerned so much?  My child keeps me so busy I don't have time to police other parents. <br>  <br>  It's a shame that people have so much time to make judgment calls on temporary tattoos, ear piercing, etc., yet there is serious child abuse going on all the time that never gets reported.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	How old was the baby? I put fake tattoos on my kids (3 1/2 and 2) and I don't see any harm in it. I also don't see any harm in putting one on a baby. I don't see much point to it, but It doesn't have harmful chemicals like nail polish, or involve pain like piercing. <br>  Now a real tattoo....|`|cHROCt3Aaa	When my daughter was about 8 months old my husband put a temporary tattoo of flaming cherries on her back. She laughed and kept wanting to see it and touch it. We laughed too...a lot. <br>  That was one time, though. I wouldn't buy a pack of them, lol. If I find the picture I will post it.|`|7N4AtRogaa	I personally wouldn't becuase I can just picture my girls screaming bloody murder when I have to wash it off.  The only 'logical' explanation I can think of is because they see the word "temporary".|`|1pK1Sd0Gaa	May be they thought its cute... I think painting baby's nails is much worse than temp tattoo.|`|BJERgbM5aa	The parents did it to enhance the baby's looks.  Their sense of beauty is their own.  People use nail polish and ear piercings for the same reason.  No big deal.  No judgment call.  It's their baby and they think the tattoo is just as beautiful as their baby.  Who are we to judge?|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Some people are freaks.  It takes all kinds to make the world spin daily... as long as it's not harming the child then so be it.  Not that I would ever do that to my baby...but to each their own.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I wouldn't do it to a 3 week old, mostly because their skin is so sensitive.  Why screw around with it?<br>  <br>  But in general, I don't think it's that awful.  I'm not rushing to put a temporary tattoo on my 8 month old, but I actually think he would like it.  I'd just be afraid he'd spend 3 days trying to suck it off, no matter where it was placed.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Hmm.. I really cant think of one good reason why someone would do that. Maybe they were bored?|`|rFtKFp03aa	My in-laws did that to one of my babies while I was showering... they did it on her back.. so I didn't see it that night till they left... <br>  <br>  He was 5 months old.. <br>  <br>  After I saw it I was angry my husband laughed and he is like, it is funny. It was hilarious, but I didn't want it on my baby lol. I would have never done it.. and I wouldn't want them to do it every time.. <br>  <br>  I don't know what is in those tattoos leaking into my babies skin.. but I am sure he will be fine from that one time.. <br>  <br>  If people are doing it in obvious spots for people to notice to look cute.. that is weird ... no point|`|vOomJtbsaa	Unless it's Halloween there is no logical reason for this!

It must be the age..

c73QkZ2haa	At 3 months my son was taking the same amount and weighed pretty much the same too. My health visitor and doctor said it was perfectly fine. Hes almost 4 months now and eating the same amount and now hes 16lbs. He was having 6oz/feed by the time he was a month. Some babies eat more than others and im of the opinion that if they are hungry feed them and my doctor agrees. <br>  And his chubby little legs are so super cute :D.|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	my 11 week old son eats anywhere from 2 to 5 oz every 2 to 4 hours he weighs 12lbs 10 oz but my feeling is this if they want to eat let them they know better then anyone how much the need and they know when they are full. I was told at his last appointment he wasn't eating enough because up until 2 days ago he was only eating 2 to 3 oz every 2 to 3 hours but he was gaining weight fine but I am not going to change the way he eats to please the doctor or anyone else he knows when he's hungry and he knows how much to eat and when he is full so don't worry about it your son is fine let him eat what he wants as long as he is gaining weight and is happy what else matters !|`|c4bUIENuaa	my 11 wk old is drinkin 2-3 oz at each feed. anywhere from 2-4 hours. i think its too little but i dont know. he weighs 12 lbs.<br>  <br>  how very often does he eat?|`|4ztXoIDKaa	my daughter is 12 wks and eats about 6oz every 2-3 hours expect for at night and she'll wake up around 4am to eat about 4oz.|`|Qa17EcZpaa	Okay he is a baby and they are intune to how much he or she wants to eat. your health visitor is just an advicer meaning they have bad advice at times, so i''ll give you the best advice, let the man eat until he is full that is fine, babies dont over eat kids do, they know how much they need to eat to be full. Really its parents stuffing food down kids because THEY FEEL the baby hasnet had enought but its not about WHAT PARENTS FEEL its about WHAT THE BABY FEELS. :)|`|avyv2i4baa	hi, my baby is 11 weeks as well and he is taking 6 to 8 oz every 2 and a half to 4 hrs during the day, he is 14lb 4oz, he sleeps 11 hrs on a night as well.health visitor has never said anything to me about his weight.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	My 11 week old takes in anywhere from 3 to 6 ounces during a feeding.

ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	we had cats before having the babies so there was n o way i was getting rid of them!  and we have NEVER had problems<br>  we heard all the scare stories baby will be smothered etc but the cats stayed away from baby<br>  <br>  they use to go over to baby but as soon as baby moves or makes a noise the cats ran off<br>  i had to watch the crib and pram coz as soon as baby was out of it they got in! so we use to put the rain cover over <br>  you will be fine  x x x|`|TBNaPkl6aa	The people who tell you that you "must" get rid of your cats once the baby comes are either totally inexperienced around cats and like repeating old wives' tales, or they are totally heartless individuals.  There is no reason to get rid of a pet unless they pose some sort of danger to the child.<br>  <br>  I have two cats and a daughter whose almost 9 months old.  The cats like my daughter, and she likes them.  I haven't had any problems.  In fact, they're really cute together.  She likes to pet the cats, and the cats purr and rub up against my daughter's feet.  It's adorable.  It will take some time for your cats to adjust to the new addition, but try to be as consistent with their schedule as you can, and give them as much reassurance as you can.  It will be hard to give them the attention they're accustomed to at first; it took me a good month or two to learn how to effectively spend time with both cats and baby.  Other good ways to get the cats used to the idea of baby are to allow them to explore the nursery before the baby arrives, but do not let them in the crib or stroller or anything like that.  Also, it's been suggested that you can play sounds of a baby crying so they can get used to that, and I also read that you can, once the baby's born, bring home a blanket that smells like the baby so they get used to that too.  We did all that stuff, and our cats and daughter all adjusted very well to each other.  Cats are more resilient than we often give them credit for, so they should be just fine.<br>  <br>  They will not suffocate your baby or anything like that; that's a load of crap.  Yes, you should always be present when pets are with children, and if you do this and have a shred of common sense, nothing should go wrong.  My cats rarely go in my daughter's crib, and if they do, it's never when she's in it.  They have never come anywhere close to her when she's sleeping.  When she's awake, they want to play with her.<br>  <br>  So don't listen to the naysayers.  I don't see how little furry creatures who are only about 10 pounds are much of a threat.  I'd be more nervous having a big dog around!  Good luck and congratulations!|`|sAbah6dTaa	well they say that cats will smother babies because they smell the milk on the babies breath and lick it or whatever. that's the only thing i knew of besides the allergy thing.|`|sqdsIHwAaa	i had 2 cats when i had new babies. I used a cat net over the moses basket and pram. Kept the bedroom door closed to keep the cot safe at night. I found that worked for me|`|BTuFtui3aa	You do NOT have to give away your cats.<br>  <br>  They should not be left unsupervised with the baby, of course. If the baby is down for a nap or something, be sure to keep a closed door between them.<br>  <br>  Cats and infants can definitely share a house, though, and can even enjoy time together as long as you're there to watch. This will prevent injury to either the baby or the cats. <br>  <br>  Studies have shown that babies who have pets in the house actually grow up to have significantly fewer allergies than babies from homes without pets.<br>  <br>  My parents had two cats when I was born, and they kept them. I loved them as a baby, and still love cats today. It was really a positive thing for me.<br>  <br>  There's no reason for you not to keep your cats. Just be smart about it, and supervise when they're around the baby.|`|bf03f3398ae59403fb987824b585b742aa	I have only 1 cat but was told the same thing.<br>  <br>  I was not getting rid of my cat. I was told that cats will lick the babies mouth coz of the smell of milk and take their breath away(somehow...think that's crap) I was also told that a cat will lie next to or on a baby for warmth and could suffocate them.Sounds a little more realistic! I just made sure that my cat was never in the room when she slept or I wasn't with her. My daughter is now 5 months old and adores the cat. She pulls her tail and tries to pat(hit) her head. My cat thinks she is playing so I just have to be careful that the claws dont come out. But I've personally never had any problems.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your little one.|`|tVQbd5MGaa	I had a cat and then a baby and it was fine, only my poor cat was ignored totally from the moment the baby came home and I felt really guilty about that. <br>  I never left them alone in the same room, not even for a minute. Cats, as you know, like their comfort and there is nothing more comfortable than a wrapped up warm baby sleeping in a carry cot.<br>  Good luck|`|inA6ZLeAaa	My cat would just sleep next to the baby and if he started crying really bad she would come running. Today he is 4 and she will still come running to him if he starts crying. Cats cannot suffer babies only a rumor!! I had two and they were fine.
pCZPtegeaa	Even at 9 days old, he will know to pull away when he's full. My daughter took 2 oz every 2-3 hours for the first 2 weeks. If he seems to just be sucking without really taking anything in, and is not pulling away, try gently stroking his cheek. That usually gets babies to start "eating" again.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats =)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I'm glad you're getting a new ped.  I remember your story, that was harsh.<br>  <br>  A hungry baby won't be satisfied by a paci for more than a minute or two.  He'll suck and suck and then spit it out and cry.  2oz. every 3 hours doesn't sound that bad to me.  You can try to get him to take more, but this young, you probably just want to roll with it.  He'll probably start taking a little more, less frequently, on his own accord.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Daily consumption is more important than "per bottle" but remember a babies stomach should only be the size of their closed fist (an adult or older child is more like a semi open fist)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_857.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_857.html</a><br>  Another way to express this rule of thumb is that the average baby takes 2 or 3 ounces of formula each day for every pound of body weight, up to a maximum of 32 ounces. A newborn weighing 7 lbs. will take an average of 14-21 ounces of formula in a day. A 4-month-old weighing 14 pounds needs 28-32 ounces.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, these are general guidelines. In real life, this may vary quite a bit from day to day and from baby to baby. It’s best to remain flexible and to let your baby’s appetite guide the amount. You don’t need to coax him to finish a bottle, or stop him if he still acts hungry. If your baby consistently chooses to take more or less than the expected amount, discuss this with your pediatrician. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g..." rel="nofollow">http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g...</a><br>  For many babies the urge to suck is strong during these early months and your baby's need to suck may extend beyond his need for nourishment. For a bottle fed baby there is an increased risk of overfeeding if his sucking urge is misinterpreted as a sign of hunger<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g..." rel="nofollow">http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g...</a><br>  Overfeeding is a common problem for bottle fed babies because many young babies cannot control the flow of milk though an artificial nipple and/or cannot indicate when they have had enough. A baby's digestive system can become overloaded when it receives excessive amounts of milk from large volume feeds or frequent feeding patterns. The larger the volume of milk, the quicker it passes through the digestive tract. Large volumes of milk may pass through a baby's small intestine too quickly for all of the lactose to be digested.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ncane.com/vo5" rel="nofollow">http://ncane.com/vo5</a><br>  It is easy for a new parent to say that they won’t break these feeding rules; however, the reality is that the temptation to quickly quiet a crying baby in the middle of the night so that the parents can garner more sleep can overcome even the most diligent of parents. Even with the determination to never do it again, parents may turn to that late night bottle more and more simply because it works and allows the parent to go back to bed quicker. During the day when the parent may be too busy to take time out to calm the infant, the parent may give the infant a bottle, figuring that the child is hungry. To some, food is the quickest and easiest solution to quiet tears and screams.<br>  <br>  While the effects may not show right away, they can have an effect on the infant later on in life. Children who are overfed as infants have a greater chance of becoming obese as teenagers and adults. With the rising rate of obesity in children on the rise, it is best to try and curb this possibility when the child is very young. By prolonging the introduction of solids or any foods beyond formula until about six months, the parents have the best chance at keeping their child off the obese path at a young age. After the child is eating solids, it is best to keep away sugary foods. Young children do not need these empty calories as a part of their daily nutritional intake. Obesity, however, is the main concern for the future of the infant. Overfeeding can cause the infant to rely on food more constantly than the average child, thus increasing his or her food intake. If unnecessary, sugary foods are added to an infant’s diet, this too can add to the obesity factor.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,3764,0..." rel="nofollow">http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,3764,0...</a><br>  ANSWER<br>  August 3, 2001<br>  Dear Dad,<br>  Yes, it is possible to overfeed a four-week-old infant since it's easy to misinterpret a baby's hunger and satiety (fullness) signals. When full, babies will stop sucking, turn their heads or push the nipple out of their mouths as a signal. Babies who are overfed often are uncomfortable and irritable. More importantly, they sometimes loose the ability to recognize when they are hungry. Parents will want to start out from the beginning to allow their baby to signal hunger and have it responded to appropriately.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lpch.org/HealthLibrary/Parent..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lpch.org/HealthLibrary/Parent...</a><br>  # The maximal amount of formula recommended per day is 32 ounces (1 liter).<br>  # Overfeeding can cause vomiting, diarrhea or excessive weight gain.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  # The average amount of formula (in ounces) that babies take per feeding usually equals the baby's weight (in pounds) divided in half (or equal to the weight in kg).<br>  # The average ounces of formula the baby takes in 24 hours is the baby's weight in pounds multiplied by 2 (or kg multiplied by 4).<br>  # A baby's appetite varies throughout the day. If the infant stops feeding or loses interest, the feeding should be stopped.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/he..." rel="nofollow">http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/he...</a><br>  Both Drs. Rome and Rogers say nature and nurture are driving the childhood obesity epidemic. If parents are obese, the chances of their children becoming obese are about 90 percent, says Dr. Rogers. Not only is the genetic potential greater, children are more likely to be raised in an environment that contributes to obesity. For instance, overfeeding is a problem. The practice often begins in infancy when parents (and grandparents), out of love or ignorance, overfeed with formula, fruit juice and baby food.<br>  <br>  Dr. Rome believes that even if parents are obese, they can help prevent their kids from becoming similarly endowed if intervention begins early. For instance with newborns and babies, parents should learn through trial and error to discern between cries that signal hunger versus those that signal discomfort (e.g., from wet diapers).<br>  <br>  Parents should consult with a pediatrician to make sure infants receive proper portions of formula and at appropriate intervals, because unlike with breastfeeding, babies do not self regulate intake of formula. Once they are off breast milk or formula, children should drink whole milk until age 2; after that, they can switch to 2 percent milk. Fruit juice, which is notorious for high caloric counts, should be restricted to four ounces a day in a baby and less than 12 ounces from toddlerhood through age 5.

My son came a month early and I spent two VERY LONG, very stressful, weeks in the NICU.  I was 2 hours away from everyone and felt very, very alone.  <br>  <br>  The feeding tubes don't hurt them.  Your daughter may find it annoying, but they are not painful.  My son had one in.  <br>  Just remember to keep your spirits up the best you can.  Babies are good at sensing stress and emotional upset.  When you feel a breakdown coming on (I had many) it is best to leave your daughters room and cry elsewhere.  <br>  <br>  Just have faith.

It is tough on the parents, but the little babies are so strong. Unbelievably strong. <br>  <br>  Many babies I've seen were under 4 lbs and being fed with a feeding tube. Their vitals are watched over as well as how well they're eating (tolerating formula), their weight, and pooping and peeing. Usually babies like this need time to develop (or kick in). I've seen most of these babies slowly take one feeding per shift then two and gradually increase to the point where the feeding tube can be safely taken out. <br>  <br>  Understand that your baby will continue to grow and as she learns how to eat more efficiently on her own, she'll show them! Babies have the will to live. So rest assured that the doctors, nurses, and staff are doing everything focusing on your baby being able to grow and develop.

Check your local library for a money management class if you're interested in learning how to do this effectively. They're usually free classes and right now that's a good thing.|`|OThwE3Whaa	Well I'm a single mom who is being laid off a week from today.  I have applied for probably 15 jobs, and so far I've been turned down for every one.  I don't get child support (my son is almost 6 months old) because my ex is dragging out our court case.

We are getting by. After the bills are paid there isn't much leftover though.  I wrote a budget and we're sticking to it.  All you have to do is cut back a bit. No more picking up dinner on the way home, brown bagging it for lunch, and I've got to watch picking up a toy for my son while i'm at the store.|`|TQW5E6olaa	We're doing great.

40527ad60966d944ca757e8d6d1c6c28aa	As long as your child is challenged but can succeed.  I always buy the books up a level or two.  If your child is already succeeding at his level in school there's every reason to challenge him a bit more and of course this can only help.  Problem is, at school the grade level work is going to be consistent unless you have a gift program where students who are high achievers can get work that challenges them in the subjects where they excel.  Ask your child's teacher to support you in giving your child challenging work.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Oh yeah. I always get my kindergartener 2nd grade books to read and he does addition, subtraction, and some easy multiplication because we make a game out of it. He's the smartest in his class and really I haven't tried that hard with him. I just read to him and played school with him every now and then. He has the workbook from walmart for kindergarten & 1st but it was easy and he lost interest.|`|FCQn5abyaa	You should ask your child's teacher what level your child is working at.  As an elementary school teacher, I have students in my classroom whose abilities span many grade levels.  Also, just because a child is ahead in one subject doesn't necessarily mean he is ahead in another subject.<br>  <br>  Giving a child something that is too advanced will not help them if they cannot understand it, it will only confuse and/or frustrate them.<br>  <br>  Workbooks are okay, but, to really help your child, find out what he is learning in class and do activities at home to go more in depth in the subject.  For example, if they are studying fractions, find ways at home to use fractions (cutting food, etc.).  If they are studying animals, go to the zoo or find books at the library about a certain animal they're interested in.  And of course; read with your child!  Reading is a wonderful way to increase vocabulary, background knowledge, and thinking skills!|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	I don't think it does. If the child is performing above grade level than yes maybe those books can improve his educational skills.. But if the child is on grade level and gets a book higher than his or her grade... I believe that the child would not understand because maybe those topics were not covered. Although there are many smart and intelligent children that can do well beyond their grade level.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	When my oldest started school, my younger son wanted to be doing what big brother was doing.  I got him worksheets off of the internet for the level I thought he would enjoy and could handle doing.  Now of course I have to tie him down to get homework done! :)|`|hZf8aJkYaa	I always had to have stuff one or two grade levels ahead.

I have a friend, that doesn't eat until like 5pm everday and now her body doesnt get hungry during the day so I would ssay JUST EAT!!!|`|8umXlm1Jaa	If you aint hungry, Don't eat anything.<br>  Do NOT follow americhans advice on consumption.|`|cljrVTpiaa	i can go without food for three days  and no i dont have anorexia or bulimia and im a healthy 140lbs and im 5ft 10" tall soo|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Does it sounds like Anorexia? I think it does please eat something and eat at your eating hours, if you wanna lose some weight that you healtily need to lose then there are other ways.|`|v0MGb17Saa	its one thing to be small and not have a large appetite. but if you don't obtain enough nutrition you will experience lots of health problems|`|HFWzvRHlaa	Yah thats bad... eat something... when we don't eat we starve our organs of the nutrients they need.... NOT GOOD... now go and eat!|`|DJpS9GDxaa	yikes, you should definitely eat something....|`|BOiV5hjKaa	no<br>  your stomach has probably shrinking<br>  nothing to worry about|`|D8SaeKQCaa	Go eat NOW!!!!

I felt better and had more energy so I am doing it again today. I will drink plenty of water though, don't want to get dehydrated.  Sometimes it is good to fast and give your digestive organs a rest.|`|HJbZHS2uaa	It happened to me and i didnt eat for 2 days.<br>  But my bf had just broken up with me after 7 months.<br>  <br>  If you really arent that hungry i suggest at least drinking a slim fast<br>  <br>  thats what i do|`|6gthdHpnaa	No. People can survive for quite some time without eating, and since you're not hungry, don't eat. But drink some water or something so you don't dehydrate.|`|hstwNjNaaa	Yeah that is bad. Go and eat something, and slowly start eating more at regular times. You need to get your body used to eating again!|`|oKoABzNtaa	It depends.  How old are you?  Are you in relatively good shape?  Are there any stressors in your life?  Do you have any body image problems?|`|7SCjPftKaa	Stop attention seeking and go and make a sandwich.|`|cLGVSuFqaa	just eat something even if your not hungry<br>  there may be something wrong with you
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's an interesting theory that I'd like to see more research on, especially with regards to a possible link to autism. Since we're seeing an increase in the rate of autism even with the mercury-free injections, I doubt it's that. What's one other thing that 99 percent of women have been subjected to, sometimes repeatedly, in pregnancy? Ultrasounds. I'm not saying it's definite, but it's something to think about. <br>  <br>  We were discussing on here a few months ago how lots of our babies had their hands up by their heads during the ultrasound. Both of my kids did, and I mentioned this to a friend of mine too and she said both her kids did, too. It makes you wonder if the sound waves from the machine bothers them, because it definitely generates sound, as well as heat. <br>  <br>  So while I think it's okay once in a while, I hate hearing about doctors who do them regularly without a real reason to, especially just to detect gender and nothing else.|`|OU9xnW86aa	Are you carrying mice? No, you are carrying a human. The only thing ultrasounds do is create sound waves. Excessively long ultrasounds can cause some additional heat but that's it. It is not harmful to a growing baby.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	UItrasounds are harmless. They wouldn't perform them like they do if they were known to cause problems. As far as getting a 3D 4D, I had them with both pregnancies. As long as you find a place that is certified in sonograms then you are fine. But you don't want to go to a place that just has anybody doing it. Make sure they are certified technicians. It can be harmful if done incorrectly.|`|yv6OLTfraa	I would think if there were any harm in getting one done, than they wouldn't be allowed. I had a 20 minute one done at 26 weeks. I haven't had my baby yet, but I am not at all worried about any side effects. <br>  <br>  Medical experts generally agree that, if used for the same time period at the recommended intensity, 3D ultrasound uses the same degree of sound waves and exposes the baby to everything a traditional, 2D, black-and-white ultrasound does.... and I'm guessing you have already had a 2D done atleast once or twice so it seems there would be no increased risk of harm getting a 3D one done. I highly recommend it!! I got to see my lil boy sleeping and moving all over the place. It was a great experience and well worth the money. Hope this helps.|`|BUggf6otaa	i totally support that.im 9 going onto 10 weeeks pregnant & i dont want to get the ultrasound like evry1 is telling me.ill just wait till im 16 or 24 weeks then id get a scan.ultra sound sounds scary.but yeah.all the best.i think im having twins & i dont wanna brag bout it till my scan but ultra sound is totally not a choice for me.cheers.x|`|VHHis05Naa	Humans are not baby mice, so I'm not sure you can infer anything from that.  <br>  <br>  I had one with my daughter and she's perfectly healthy.  I will be having one with this baby as well.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Well my comment is why would any one have an 3D or 4D ultrasound for longer than a few minutes.  I go in and get 2D ultrasound done all the time at my high risk doctor (every 2 to 3 weeks after my 18 week).  And at the end of the appointment after he has checked everything necessary he does a few minutes, just a few minutes of 3D and a little of 4D.  So grand total I have will probably have no more than 30 minutes  (likely less) of 3D and for 4D done.  And my baby is not as small as mouse anyway and does not have the exact brain composition as a mouse.  So don't know how this study is really relevant. <br>  <br>  So I don't know why anyone especially those that are low risk would ever have more than a few minutes with those machines.  It is not like you are watching a full length movie of your baby.  A mean after a couple of minutes there really isn't any thing else to see.
Oq2B7I4faa	Use breathing Technic, it really helps.   don't scream during contraction and save all the energy for pushing.  Believe me you will need it.  Also have someone strong like your husband by your side when it's time to push,  During the time of my pushing I was holding my husband's hand so tight that at the end his hands were hurting him.  And in the room, have people only whom you are comfortable with.|`|qoxAmc9Xaa	congratulations. dont be scared for one thing it is not as bad as you think. if you are doing all natural no meds then the pain you feel when you go into active labor- dialated 10 crowning- is about as bad as it is going to get. if you are doing all natural then just listen to your body it does most of the work. you will know when to push and everything!!! enjoy yuor wonderful bundle of joy they are fun!!!!|`|ewOD5x0taa	Breaatheeee. That's the most important thing. I think if you don't scream it is actually easier, just take breaths and try to stay as calm as possible. And if someone is doing something(like your husband is being annoying or holding your hand) and you don't want him to, don't be afraid to tell him to back off.|`|qusZuvqoaa	It is difficult, i will not say my true opinions on labor and delivery b/c i dont want to scare you.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that an epidural is an option that is there to help you, not harm you.|`|Xc02z608aa	Labour hurts.  Don't feel bad if you need something for the pain.  <br>  <br>  It's also not as bad as a lot of women make it out to be.  Just take it one contraction at a time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats!  =)|`|ihL0FkJYaa	Congrats and Good luck I wish I was close to delivering I've got a ways to go. Hope you have a great experience and a beautiful baby.|`|1YHih8wyaa	Relax as much as you can right now!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	The biggest piece of advice: don't expect your baby to come by then! Very few actually come on their due date and many first time moms are late (although I wasn't one of them, so you never know!)<br>  <br>  Good luck with a natural birth - I didn't have an epidural and I had a great experience. And once the baby is out, the pain is gone!<br>  <br>  Just relax, stay calm and focused, and you should do just fine!|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Don't be upset if your due date passes and you're still pregnant.  I just KNEW my baby would be early, then my due date came and went... lol<br>  <br>  Get lots and lots of sleep now before the baby gets here.  When the baby gets home you won't sleep very much.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	Congrats and Good luck I wish I was close to delivering I've got a ways to go.  Hope you have a great experience and a beautiful baby.|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	i'm due in 3 weeks.my mom told me when i'm ready to start pushing only push when the doctor tells you.if you don't,you are likely to rip you're self.<br>  hope this helps.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	As soon as you feel a contraction coming, start gasping on that gas and air! It won't be much help if you wait until the height of your pain.
e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	It really depends.  Every woman is different.  Having said that, I can only tell you how mine changes through a cycle.  Right after AF, I have a couple dry/sticky days, nothing much to speak of.  Then it starts getting to a white, creamy consistency like lotion.  Then just before/during ovulation it's clear and stretchy like egg-whites.  After ovulation it dries up again.  A couple days before AF I get creamy CM again.  I haven't been pregnant (my husband and I just started TTC) so I have not basis there.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps a little.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	go to this site and watch the video, it will tell you all of this and you will learn so much I promise <a href="http://essentialconceptionguide.com" rel="nofollow">http://essentialconceptionguide.com</a> <br>  <br>  Good luck
kIblsxJQaa	wear fitted shirts more or a t-shirt with a printed logo saying "Pregnant - not fat"  just wait in a couple of weeks (days even) you will look pregnant. its the last couple of weeks when it shows.|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	i'm 37 weeks & remember when i started mt 3rd trimester my stomach pocked out(i'm having a boy).<br>  i had a lot of people staring at my stomach.i got use to it after a while.don't let it bother you.as long as you & you're man know you're pregnant that's enough.<br>  good luck.|`|71426c90338c6daa00b5005f598c343aaa	Yup, I feel like that, but I'm only 13 weeks!!  I'm pregnant with my 3rd, so I already have a noticeable bump, but I'm getting those "is she/isn't she" looks too, they amuse me, but I wish people would ask so I can share the joy - lol!!!<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll show soon, bump will get much bigger over the next couple of months...  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  *Mummy to Alex, 6, Encarni, 1 and due 29 Aug*|`|fHgbL046aa	I am 19weeks and 6 days pregnant and I feel the same way. I lost 6 pound but my stomach is bigger. I look fat not pregnant. With my first child I started showing about 6 months and you could tell I was pregnant not fat.|`|i8Y3p9CAaa	o yea, i went from 120 pounds to weighing 180, im only 29 weeks! so you can only imagine, every one gives me the same stairs, i wear maternity shirts, it makes round look more round rather than wide|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Okay then....if you worry about it that much then just wear more fitted shirts....it's that simple|`|AA11059034	Trust me I'm right there with you!! I'm a couple weeks into my 3rd trimester (35 wks) and I am carrying low and wide! With my first I had a girl and I carried her more like a basketball but with my boy I'm carrying more like a watermelon! And I work at a hotel and have interaction with people and I too to tell they wanna ask but are scared like you said better safe then sorry...lol....|`|euN3ct9oaa	Lol I was chubby to begin with during my pregnancy. Then suddenly, I got huge. My first pregnancy...I looked fat and overweight till I was 6 months along. Talk about embarrassing. Maternity pants (with that bella band if you can afford), do wonders, they show your true shape. Hang in there, not too much longer, you will be sorry lol. Your stomach will get big and in the way. Good luck and congrats!|`|i6mydMOyaa	I am 19 weeks...and well, I just look fat! I am also carrying wide (just like my last pregnancy) and it sucks!<br>  <br>  I notice the looks, but you are right, no one ever asks, for fear of me just being fat!!! Ha!<br>  <br>  So I went a bought a lot of fitted shirts...it kinda helped:-)
E6T9DPT9aa	Kinda crazy, but stop pushing her boundaries. Just don't show her. She may not know what they are. She might think it's gambling or something.<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|bS7DN85Qaa	She's nuts.|`|6L9jJnchaa	So your mom lets you act like a ****, but you can't have tarot cards because she thinks they are evil...I would just be grateful she doesn't care what you do with your life and forget the cards.|`|6gthdHpnaa	She might think you're gambling or into witchcraft or something. Explain to her that you're not, and what you want to use the Tarot cards for. Why don't you use a standard deck of cards instead?|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Tarot Cards really aren't bad. She's completely overreacting.|`|ZAnTlEzNaa	o wow sounds kinda crazy to me, don't worry, that's just moms, mine's the same lol|`|PqcEjB0Oaa	Tarot cards aren't used for those games and maybe your mom is freaked because she thinks you are using that for-what she may think- "weird" uses, i think Tarot cards are used for Witch-craft (witches are real not the hollwood type but the Wiccan type) and doesn't want you to do that. If you want to play bridge use some regular cards.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Yes, your mother is insane.<br>  <br>  Probably for religious or superstitious reasons.<br>  <br>  <br>  However, going out until 11PM wearing mini-skirts and not informing your friends where you are going is probably a risky thing to do.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Watch out !!! Tarot Cards are Divination Cards and if your mom has any religiousity in her she's right to be concern about those, the Bible forbids any sort of divination metods.|`|whBQ9Q7saa	to some tarot cards are not a game like bridge especially any religious beliefs  so your mom probably feels that way about them <br>  many things are diffrent to some people|`|NZyFz90Jaa	that is crazy. lol there just cards!|`|AA12221820	SHES A WEIRD ONE|`|49LiABmvaa	a little bit|`|FAGI8owFaa	for sure
NeTNnvSZaa	I don't have a lock on the door and have never been caught.  I also have an old house with wooden floors so it's easy to hear someone approaching OR if I'm loud enough the kid is afraid to find out what's going on. lol|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Not now honey, the kids are in the same state.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Yes, my oldest once got up because she had a bad dream, we didn't' have the door locked because we didn't have a lock for the door. We heard the door opening and stopped so I am not too shure what she actually saw other than us scrambling for the covers! We didn't say anything to her about it, but went and got a lock for the door recently because of it, we don't want to be interrupted again! I'm seriously thinking about getting a lock for the bathroom door as well, if I don't have kids coming in there to bug me, the cats find a way to open the door and come in to see what i'm doing lol!|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Not a parent. I'm a teenager.<br>  But. I hear my parents ALL the time. I think if I could hear them, I'm 100%  I do NOT want to go in there. <br>  <br>  I remember when "they were making my brother though" They went in the basement to have sex and I was six or seven and they told me to not go down there and I went down there so many times that they basically kicked me out of the house for the night to a friends now, nine months later my brother happened >_>|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I have only been walked in on once and that was about 6 years ago. They say that you should act natural and not freak out and scare the child. We do not close our door but we live in an old house with wood floors so if anyone is walking around we can hear them.  <br>  <br>  ETA to the girl that says she hears her parents all the time...ew|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Yes!!!  I thought he locked the door, he thought I locked the door and in walks my, then 7 yr. old!  Thankfully it was a lights-off night! LOL  Although my son asked the next moring what we were doing, I told him we were wrestling and mommy was winning! LOL|`|UCq7SjsRaa	Yes, our four year old daughter caught us recently. We were honest about it and told our daughter that it is a 'special cuddle' and that it's something that grown ups when they're in love. She was fine with that I think, not much mental scarring (I hope, I think) Good luck.|`|KWaTVVpGaa	Lock the door and teach your kids early on to knock if the door is shut. If you go into their room and the door is shut, knock first that way they learn from you.|`|ysUg2Rgraa	No, thank goodness! I would be embarrased,lol.<br>  <br>  When we do, we always lock the door..
wWyChyYiaa	First....YEAH on the positive OPK!!!!!  That is an awesome first step.  It took me forever to get to that step.  If you had sex that day...it is your best shot.  It is also good that you skipped a day because that gave his sperm some time to rejuvinate.  I was always told (by my fertility doctor and my Ob/GYN) that when the second line starts to come in faintly (usually around day 10) to start having sex every other day for like 10 days (so having sex 5 times).  It gives the best chance for conception.  For me...I usually ovulated on day 14....so I would BD on day 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.  I am not sure if this falls in line with what you have been told, but it was very helpful for me.<br>  <br>  So...to answer your question....yes...there is a chance you could be pregnant.  However, if you are not....don't get discouraged.  It may take a while.<br>  <br>  There is a great book on the market now that has really helped quite a few of my friends.  it is entitled "Stirrups Aren't Just For Horses" by Janean Buyny.  It explains everything about trying to conceive, and everything you may have to go through.  It talks about pills, and what days are the best to conceive.  It talks about tips for what increases sperm count (cinnamon and oysters and vanilla).  It talks about everything that a real woman would want to know.  You may want to check it out if you want a good and easy read.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you....and Keep us Posted!!!|`|8N4aPcpaaa	i didnt do the ovulation kit but i remember when i was trying to concieve it was a hard time 4 me so i wish yuo lots of baby dust and i hope you did get pregnant
i6mydMOyaa	Count me in!!!!<br>  <br>  My MIL was VERY nasty to my husband as they grew up. She took their divorse out on the kids and constantly complained about having them. She said horrible thing to them, which my husband says affected his self esteem for a long time!  He has never said she was really physically abusive, but I know she threw things at them and once pushed my husband down some stairs when he was 10. <br>  <br>  But worst of all, she complains that she doesn't see our son enough, and wonders why she isn't allowed to be alone with him!!!! HAAAA!  My husband fully supports this, but when she does visit, he goes off and leaves me to entertain her!!<br>  <br>  Plus she is VERY uneducated (which isn't always a bad thing) and parrots what her friends say or do...even if it doesn't fit the situation!!  Seriously, sometimes I can't believe the things that come out of her mouth!!<br>  <br>  So yah, you could say I can't stand her...but that might be an under estimate!!<br>  <br>  Wow, that was a can of worms, eh?  Thanks for the vent!|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	actually my mother in law and i get along quite well... my husbands family is from russia and his parents don't speak english very well. i find the lack of communication to be a plus, because if were able to communicate with them better, i probably wouldn't like them lol.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	Me, me, me!  LOL  Mine is sickening sweet to my face and then bad mouths both me and my husband to her other son and daughter, who then call my husband and tell him. When you confront the old bat, she just sits there smilin' and lyin" and I swear......sometimes I just want to smack her one!  I try so hard to be civil to her because she is elderly and she is my husbands mother, but man.....it's a real challenge sometimes! When we got married, she actually filled her plate with food at the reception AHEAD of the announcement that the buffet was open and waltzed herself over and plunked down next to my husband at the bridal table in the bride's chair. Unreal. We moved her to a rental house close to us after we'd been married for a few years because she'd been living in another state away from all of her family. Due to her age, we felt it was safer for her to be near family. We paid all of her moving expenses, AND rented her a house which we also paid to paint inside and out because she's so picky. She lived there for two months before she started complaining about how awful it was and how isolated she was. She called my husbands sister and told her we'd put her in a house that had no heat (a LIE! It didn't have electric heat, which is what she had previously. It had propane heat, plus two wood burning stoves) She was just trying to elicit sympathy from the daughter so she'd pay for mom to move closer to her because she decided after she got here that she didn't like country living.  Ugggh.  She is the most manipulative, lying person I have ever met! Thank God my hubby finally got tired of it and paid for her to move closer to his sister. Now she's gibing THEM all the problems she gave us and calling us to complain about how awfully they treat her.  LOL  What a witch!|`|MFsuN8Doaa	I can't, mine is an interfering old bag who has reduced me to tears plenty of times since I got pregnant - it got to the point where even my hubby told her she was out of order!|`|irP2yTMWaa	no i love them all i hate no one.If i don't like anyone i understand why and try to solve it|`|D5cOFZdwaa	ME ME ME ME!

Bw1h5xAcaa	Strengthening and stretching exercises, such as with yoga, couldn't hurt, but I don't know if close vertebrae can necessarily be corrected through exercise. I would consult with an anesthesiologist at your delivering hospital about it, they will have the best answers for you.<br>  <br>  If you need another section, yes, they will allow the person of your choosing to be with you, it doesn't have to be the father.|`|qusZuvqoaa	If you go you go under they usually do not allow anyone in the room.<br>  <br>  If you have a a regular delivery you get a few people, like 1-3 maybe, depending on hospital. If you have a c section you usually get 1 person at least maybe more depending on hospital. <br>  <br>  <br>  There is really nothing that will make your vertabre further apart.<br>  <br>  You know what, honestly, consider yourself lucky. I would give up hearing my daughter cry in a heartbeat if i didnt have to suffer through that horrible horrible delivery I went through. It is Not always worth it to hear your child cry. You are lucky to just wake up and have a baby handed to you.|`|4szKHHtJaa	Also, you may want to discuss your situation with a chiropractor; being an expert in the verterbrae they may have some good exercises or techniques for you. Also, contact www.ican-online.org/ ; they are an international group to help women with cesarean issues and to encourage VBACs; they may have support groups in your area. Also, consider hiring a birth doula for the birth itself; their support has been found to reduce the rates of both epidurals and the need for cesarean. Find a good childbirth class in your area (bradley, lamaze, icea, etc.) that will help you gather information to have a natural childbirth/vbac and avoid the need for c-section and spinals. Good luck!

miFe45quaa	Alice by far! It's classy and sophisticated. I love it.<br>  And I adore the nickname Allie =)<br>  <br>  Madison is too trendy. And the nickname Maddie & Addie are getting quite annoying (no offense).<br>  <br>  I don't like Alice Grace.

Madison is a masculine boy's name meaning Son of Maude; Matthew's Son. It is not feminine.<br>  <br>  [Edit] Funny how the person below does not thinks the feminine Alice is pretty, yet thinks the ugly horribly masculine Madison is.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Alice Grace is waaay better! Madison is so common, overused, and masculine. Alice Grace is pretty, but Alice Grace doesn't really flow well. They both end in the same sound.<br>  <br>  Alice Magnolia & Alice Marigold are my personal favorite combos :)|`|BRT2teSqaa	Madison is overused and just ugly.  Not feminine at all- has SON in it.<br>  <br>   Alice is beautiful, more uncommon and SO feminine.|`|hR1LlS2Haa	Alice Grace. Honestly, Madison is so overdone, Alice is old fashioned but you never hear it any more. You can call her Allie, or Lissy as nicknames|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Alice is actually rare. Very simple, but it is a name that "ages" well. I love it. I also love Madison. They're both really great names.|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Honestly Madison has been so overdone I prefer Alice out of the two choices.  Alice Grace doesn't sound great together IMO.  Say it out loud, it just doesn't sound very nice.  Allison Grace sounds better to me.|`|8JzimdBDaa	I do love Madison, but lately I've been very fond of Alice and Allie as a nickname. So, I would say Alice Grace.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Madison is my favorite girl name.|`|AA12221820	ALICE GRACE|`|ValLVBcYaa	Madison. I LOVE that name. (=|`|Q6usQV1zaa	JUST ALICE DON'T PUT GRACE|`|OqryfKJhaa	I love Madison Grace, but I think maybe the -ce at the ends of Alice and Grace are too much. I really like the name Alice, though so maybe Alice Amelia or Alice Olivia! I think a middle name ending in -a would sound good with Alice.<br>  <br>  Edit: People are seriously going through this and thumbs-downing people who like Madison Grace? I picked Olivia out of the two! If that wasn't apparent.|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I much prefer Madison Grace. I also like Madison Jane. I do not like the name Alice at all. It is less common than Madison, but for a reason. Alice just does not strike me as a pretty name.

It's classic, elegant and has substance.  Besides it's a lot less common and just prettier.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I like Madison better but it is popular. Alice grace sounds better if is is Allison.
CIBtfxEqaa	There are pros and cons to every situation, but I can tell you that I had a C-section, and I am so happy I did. I tried to have my daughter vaginally, but (doctor's words, not mine) my "outlet" was too small. I never would have survived back in the old days! The C-section was not bad at ALL. They give you medicine, and you don't bleed nearly as much as you would have if you have a vaginal birth. Insurance does cover C-sections, have you checked to see if yours covers ELECTIVE C-sections? They might only cover medically necessary ones. The scar is about 3-4 inches long, and it fades over time. It's really low, right over the bikini line, so no one will see it, even if you wear a bathing suit. If you're going to have help for the first 2 weeks, sounds great and I would go for it. I was back in commission after being home for 3 days, doing laundry, dishes, whatnot. Is the scar on your back vertical? If it is, make sure it will not hinder you getting an epidural. Those are a godsend. There are people out there who think having a baby vaginally makes them some kind of hero. Being a good mommy will make you the hero, not HOW you bring the child into the world! Do whatever makes you feel good. Vaginally is good, but if you want a C-section, don't let anyone make you feel like any less of a woman or mommy for doing so! Good luck, and congratulations!|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I'm not sure that you can have a c-section just because you want to, unless you've had prior c-sections. As you've said it's a major surgery, and I don't think any reputable doctor would give someone a c-section for a first birth by choice. I had a c-section with my son, and it was definitely painful.There is a much longer recovery time than with a natural birth. If you are dead set on having one, you need to talk to your doctor about it.|`|iwCYJ18faa	I would say that  some of your cons are debatable, many women have vaginal births safely after a C-Section, but it is a risk. Unless you have a health issue that is preventing you from having a safe vaginal birth, I wouldn't choose to have a C-Section. The healing process, as you stated is much longer and painful, which could prevent you from spending crucial time with your newborn.|`|GxMSrrFLaa	I had a c-section 9 weeks ago. I thought I was gonna die from pain. Now I dont even think about it. Just wanted to let you know they dont sever the muscles anymore so the healing of those is really just time for them to come back together. Not unlike many women go though from pregnancy alone. So thats one con you dont really need to be concerned about. As for the scar its really minimal. I mind my stretchmarks way more than the scar. If you can get the doctor to do it, go for it. But be prepared for a couple of weeks of needing help just to lean forward or back. And look out for that first poop! Good luck and congrats! You and baby will be fine whatever choice you make.|`|bbKcF8G9aa	I have not had a child yet but I'm thinking about having one. At my last gyno appointment I told my doctor I wanted to have a C-section and he said that wouldn't be a problem. I'm not sure if this is the norm for doctor's as I have been seeing him for 14 years. But he seemed like it woulnd't be a problem to schedule one even though there was no reason to have one. However, I am very petite and he told me I probabaly wouldn't be able to handle a 7 pound baby. So I might have to have one anyways.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Having a C-Section is a Major Surgery (as you mentioned)...<br>  <br>  Its really not necessary unless the DR advises to do so. You should have your Child Vaginally if all is possible. You recover a lot quicker and its doesn't take so much of a toll on your body. <br>  <br>  I myself had a C-Section and It was the worst pain I think I have ever been in. You cant lift or let alone do a whole lot of nothing for 6 weeks sometimes longer. <br>  <br>  Plus, I really dont think your DR will allow you to have a C-section unless he sees Medical Reasoning to do so. <br>  <br>  You should really think about this.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I had a c-section, and believe me, it isn't something you want to choose to do if not medically needed. <br>  <br>  I had a dream I gave birth to kittens, and belive me, that didn't happen.  <br>  <br>  Its no fun being drugged up during the first few days of your babies life.  I couldn't even stand up with my son in my arms, and it was very upsetting.  IT is a majoy surgery, and much more painful and longer recovery then a vaginal birth.  Besides, not all doctors will do a c-section for no reason.  I would question a doctors judgement that allows a c-section for no medical reason.  <br>  And as far as tigthening those muscles.  I had a c-section 13 months ago and this past month I have been toning my stomach, and my scar acutally hurts and has this dull pain as my muscles and stomach get back in shape.  <br>  Don't elect a c-section if you don't need one, they aren't fun and they are much more risky then vaginal births.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Well, you can try for a VBAC after having a first c-section. So having multiple c-sections is not always required.<br>  <br>  The recovery time is much longer for a c-section, you're looking at 6 weeks of recovery versus just a day or two for vaginal birth.<br>  <br>  C-sections are definitely more dangerous for the baby (and the mother) than making a trip down the birth canal.<br>  <br>  C-sections can be extremely painful. When I had mine, I was pretty positive I was going to die. The stitching-up process was horrendous. I'd give anything to go back in time and have my baby the natural way.<br>  <br>  It might be difficult to elect for a c-section. Some doctors won't allow it unless there is a health problem, and many insurance companies will not cover an elective c-section. Make sure you look into that, there's a huge difference between being saddled with a $20,000 bill for an elective c-section versus $1,000 for a natural birth.<br>  <br>  Good luck whatever you choose!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I would check with your doctor and insurance company first...most doctors will not just do a c-section unless you have had one before or its an emergency. I dont think you really get a choice.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Has your doctor said this is an option?  Typically doctors (and insurance company's too) will only allow (or pay for) a c-section if it is medically necessary.<br>  <br>  I had a c-section for my first child, my OBGYN warnd that recovery runs the gamete just like delivering vaginally.  My recovery went great and I'm perfectly happy to have another one when I decide to have my second child.  My took my pain meds as recommended while in the hospital, and once out only took two doses of oxycodone at home and nothing for pain after that.  I did make sure to take it easy and avoid any heavy lifting or walking up stairs excessively for two weeks, but after that was back 100% and no problems.  My scar healed fine.  I guess for me the scar isn't an issue, I'm not a bikini kind of girl anyway, so no one but my husband and doctor saw that low on my stomach so it doesn't bother me!  LOL<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I was up on my feet four hours after delivering my son, and walked around the maternity ward three times a day for the three days I was there.  You know those little carts they put the baby in that's on wheels in the hospital?  I'd push that and walk around the circle like it was a stroller.  I held and breast fed my son under an hour after he was born and was able to enjoy the visitors as well.  I had no pain during my c-section either, the worst was a little feeling like floating in water when i was moved, that was it.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I strongly recommend against scheduling a c-section just for convenience.  I personally had a c-section with my first and vaginal deliveries with my next two, and I would never recommend a c-section to someone who didn't need one.<br>  <br>  Other cons for the c-section...<br>  Longer, much more painful recovery period (up to 6 weeks) -- it hurts just to laugh, cough, or roll over in bed<br>  Possible complications with the incision<br>  More post-partum restricions (no lifting of anything heavier than the baby, no stairs, etc.)<br>  Possible that baby will be delivered too soon, and lungs won't be fully developed, etc.<br>  <br>  Pros for the vaginal delivery...<br>  Much quicker recovery in most cases<br>  Can hold baby and nurse baby sooner<br>  Allows the baby to choose his/her own birthday<br>  Fluid is naturally expelled from baby's lungs during delivery so less chance of breathing problems<br>  You get to experience labor (women have been doing it since the beginning of time, and there's something to be said for getting to experience that yourself -- it doesn't have to be something to fear)<br>  <br>  The uncertainty of a vaginal delivery is just the first step in a lifetime of uncertainties as a parent.  Even if you do schedule the c-section, so many other things are going to happen that you can't plan for perfectly or schedule, and life will go on.<br>  <br>  I get, too, that the dream terrified you because I've had dreams like that, too, but the reality is that very, very few babies actually die in childbirth.  And most of the time, if a c-section is required, the doctors can determine that quickly enough so that no harm comes to mom or baby.  Honestly, it's irresponsible for doctors to perform a c-section with absolutely no medical reason to do so, and it's possible that your doctor wouldn't even do one (even though some do).<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision, and I wish you the best with the remainder of your pregnancy.|`|FLpMShKNaa	being scared is so normal, but I think the mortality rate is actually a bit higher for c section babies vs. vaginal birth. Also, scheduling it can be risky if the due date is off. And they monitored my son constantly thru labor.<br>  My labor sucked about as bad as possible, I had back labor, it was inefficient and went on a log time. But, even though I was sore I recovered fairly quick, was able to get around and I am sure nursing is easier if you don't have a c-section, and i don;t have a scar. So, unless there was a need for a c section, I wouldn't want one. I am not judging, just wouldn;t go for an elective one.<br>  Also-most OBS won't let you go more than a day or two past your due date as far as planning goes-and daycare will let you secure a spot with a deposit, they won't turn you away cause your leave was a little later than planned.
gaiCNtEFaa	I hated it.  I am having #2 also.  I am not a touchy feely person anyway.  So I did not like having my belly rubbed.  It's not like the baby moves constantly, so the chances of them feeling it move are slim.  I think I snapped when this complete stranger walked up to me in the store and just started rubbing.  I started to rub her back.  She was offended, but  hey, so was I.   My sister also likes to touch and bounce my stomach right now.  I have horrible morning sickness all day so it just adds to my discomfort.  I tell her to leave me alone.  I do however let my 2 1/2 year old touch anytime he wants.  It helps him understand better.|`|03f100b7d34df8ee17796e093fefa637aa	I am pregnant 35 wks with our first and I hate people touching my belly and still don't like people doing it.  I feel like that is something personal and I don't think they should just assume it is ok to do.  I have never just went up to someone and touched their belly or asked to touch it.  I always waited for them to offer to let me touch it.  I LOVE when my husband touches it but anyone other than that I don't like.  It pisses me off too.|`|B7iSU8UYaa	Early in my pregnancy, I hated when people tried to touch my belly. But later (when I was really showing or the baby was moving) I did not mind, since people really are just so curious and in awe of carrying new life. <br>  <br>  But I really think people need to ask before they touch! It's no different than any other stranger. Feel free to say no to touchy people. "I'm not comfortable" is usually enough.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	I hate when people touch my belly, especially when they don't ask!!! I'm very protective of my bump!! When I walk by someone in a tight isle I notice my hand covering my bump getting ready to protect it, cuz usually they stop and want to touch me..yuck!!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I agree with you! I hate the hands on my belly. I'm like the baby can't feel that and you can't feel her so why are you touching me!<br>  <br>  lol I have though about (never did though) touching their bellies back. lol It's awkward so they'd know how I feel then!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	It doesn't really bother me. Maybe b/c people have just started doing it. I'm sure it will get annoying as my belly grows and people touch it more.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	I didnt have other people touching my belly in either of my pregnancy's, apart from family!!|`|ihL0FkJYaa	no ur not alone with this|`|InVApnDAaa	its the hormones in your body i have 2 kids two i was the same way just let people know you don't like being touched if they do u might have to slap them lol  take some tums and  tynol and rest try not to be around to much stuff thats going on that dont help the stressing out just take it easy!|`|SihmWU0Baa	i get tired of people touching mine to so whenever people touch it i either move it for them and say no or i say if you dont move your hand your gunna lose it...<br>  <br>  just if you see a hand coming towards you just avoid it and say no|`|imIiuaAAaa	I haven't really had anyone but family or friends touch my belly, but then again I'm just starting to show lol.

KRo3Ik3Baa	Oooh, I get this. very embarassing when coughing hard or laughing.   Another majorly embarassing TMI story - my husband and I were "getting busy" in the bedroom and as I was about to "o" I actually squirted!!  I was so embarassed!!  I keep hearing do the kegels so I'm working on it.  Good luck!|`|8WRnqs08aa	I experienced leaking urine whenever I'd laugh, cough, sneeze and sometimes just bend down to pick something up. After my third child, I saw a urologist because with each baby it got worse and did not resolve after delivery.<br>  <br>  I had a TVT (Transvers Vaginal Taping). This is wear the bladder is held up so it does not droop and cause the symptoms I once had. I was diagnosed with a small bladder, meaning that my bladder can only hold 2.5cc vs the norm which is 5cc.<br>  <br>  That surgery was a life saver! I gave birth last June and I am currently pregnant with twins. I have not had any leakage or issues other than frequent urination, which is normal for pregnancy.<br>  <br>  During your pregnancy continue to wear a panty liner and if it doesn't resolve after pregnancy, then go see a urologist.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mother of 4 beautiful children with Twins due 09/10/09|`|xnhwmontaa	lol it happens to the best of us! Also it can happen if you have a weak bladder. I had two girls via c section and when i get to laughing, coughing, or sneezing real hard i leak too..|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	It will go away. Wear a liner and try kegel exercise yahoo search will bring a lot up|`|XDp8q0uLaa	I think pretty much every expectant mother has been there!!  I wore liners and it does go away after birth.  I know Kegel<sp> exercise is a good way to lessen the leakage, I have to admit I was to lazy to really keep up with it.  Good luck and stay positive and know that this is only temporary!  Best wishes to you, your family and the new little one!|`|wHOQXToHaa	Yes usually it goes away right after birth (thank god!). LOL, I remember when I had the stomach flu at the end with my first pregnancy, and I would throw up so hard I kept peeing everywhere- as if throwing up wasn't bad enough!! Not much you can do to prevent it except make a trip to pee EVERY time you pass the bathroom. It helps a little, best wishes to you! It will be over soon!|`|I6qfoJaiaa	sometimes this goes away after birth and there is no longer a baby on the bladder. Try to make sure you empty your bladder completely, don't hold it, and try doing kegals.|`|OU9xnW86aa	Practice your kegels to strengthen the muscles. That should really help.<br>  <br>  You can find more info if you do a search online.|`|Khs7HBYmaa	THIS IS FROM THE BABY PRESSING DOWN ON YOUR BLADDER. PADS ARE THE BEST SOLUTION. IT USUALLY DOES STOP AFTER BIRTH.|`|ouh5eXcmaa	yes every woman has it when your pregnant|`|cn91FeWcaa	kegels exercise|`|BUggf6otaa	yeah.i get that 2.& its very annoying.|`|i8Y3p9CAaa	ever heard of kegals? tighting of your vagina muscles, just do that like 10 times a day, it should help you hold urine and its good when your in labor because it helps build muscle to help push the baby out...good luck|`|NPmRmnG6aa	Have you been doing kegile (sp)? If not start doing them, they are good for leaking batters and helps you from having an epesomity (sp).|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Besides wearing a pad there isnt anything you can do right now. It will take some time after the birth as well to go back to yourself again. Try doing keegal's as much as possible after birth to tighten everything back up and help with that. Goodluck =)
aYCjy8Neaa	We purchase the first one (plastic one) for my son when he was younger. He would never stay in it without screaming. So we kinda wasted our money on it. It is however very nice for around the christmas tree lol. They sell that gate at walmart too, it may be cheaper there.|`|EMKuBql8aa	We owned the first one and ended up giving it away.<br>  <br>  We tried it with both of my kids and they hated it with a passion. Plus, once they get a bit older, they can crawl out of it easily. But my friends kid has it and she loves it. I really think it depends on the kid, save your receipt so you can return it if necessary.|`|GeHrKxThaa	I have the first one as well. It's easy to add new sections and is very stable when assembled. I used it for a few months until my daughter started trying to climb out of it.|`|geuF7GsHaa	We have the plastic one actually. They work well.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.
93Pmc3N1aa	Well, I started the dating convo. with my mom by asking...<br>  "Mom how old were you when you had your first boyfriend?"<br>  and then your mom will probably catch on, and it should all go from there. Its nice that you have enough respect for your mom and yourself to ask permission to date. Most girls (including me) just go ahead and date. I asked her that question after I got the guy, and she said it was my life, and prefrably to her I was to young but I can make my own decisions. Good luck hun ^^|`|JRXpYW3Naa	You really need to use your own words.<br>  But tell her there is a boy you really like, explain a little about him, tell her she can meet him if she wants, and reassure her you know all about sex and how dangerous it can be. If you are honest with her she, she might let you. Be prepared for a long intimate talk.|`|JWLyNrLHaa	I started dating at 15 and I didn't ask my mom's permission. I say go out and do what you want.|`|AA12145826	How about: "Mom, am I old enough to start dating?"|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I like the first answer.  You could start it off by saying, "Mom, could we talk for a minute. I was wondering what your rules on dating were.'  If she asks why then tell her there is a boy at school, church, whatever that you're interested in and would like to go on a date with.  She will probably want to meet him first or want you to do a double date with a friend.|`|VyU2d8Ohaa	ask her "how old do i have to be to have a boyfriend" and that should tell you

1VOsRV8Maa	Most likely he is making the connection. People may think I'm too harsh on my baby, but sometimes if I'm changing him (he's 8 months lod) and he's kicking and whining, I'll gently flick his leg with my finger and tell him "that's NOT ok!" or "Don't kick mommy." Eventually, I only have to say it, because he associates those words with the "flick," and will stop. I did it to him when he was about 3 or 4 weeks old and breastfeeding. He'd pull on my nipple to "look around." I would gently tap his lip and say, "Don't pull!" I only had to do it a couple times before all I had to do was SAY "Don't pull" and he would let go... Babies understand more than we give them credit for. And also, studies have shown that if you DON'T gain your child's respect before they are TWO years old, you will spend the rest of your life "negotiating" with them. Earn it now. He understands! :) Good luck!|`|Xc02z608aa	When you son starts throwing a fit, that is your cue to ignore him.  THe more you respond to it, the more he'll throw fits.  Try taking him right away from the "no" and distracting him with a toy or sing him a song or show him a book.  He throws fits because they make you pay attention to him.  If you don't stop them now, they only get worse.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	My son didn't get it at that age- he would still do it anyway. He is 10 months now and I know he understands because he will look at me and laugh while doing it. He tests me if I am not near him but if I am up close he will move on. <br>  <br>  At 7 months my son understood bath time. I would say "are you ready for your bath?" and he would get real excited and even started crawling to the bathroom.|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	i think he does understand..when he does something bad you should tap his hands, as if you were hitting him, and he'll start understanding what he can or cant do..my nephew is 7 months and a half and he understands when my sister is correcting him, even though he dont always follow through...and he cries when his parents are arguing or play fighting..|`|h2i92yA7aa	Probably :]<br>  <br>  If my little brother acts up while he's with mom, she'll just call out"Nina, come get Justice" and he starts acting like a good little quiet boy for three or four minutes|`|f2ca550ba141680eff4abf0b4511313caa	Of course he Doesn't understand dicipline hes 7 months old! He is just a baby, if he is upset its probably because he is teething,  what on earth could he be doing thats so bad already, if he is touching things then you need to child proof your house, Dont throw him in his room by himself, hes just a little guy, relax and give him a hug instead of a threat, positive is always better than negative.|`|J4YNRrsuaa	NO of corse they cant understand.. usually if a 7 motnh old is throwing a fit that means hes hungry or needs a diaper|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	He may be. Im sure he knows what bed is. I would just walk off when he throws his fits though. If he sees he is not getting the attention it will quit|`|J9Tbun7naa	He doesn't understand the concept behind discipline.... (i.e. that he is doing something "wrong")<br>  <br>  BUT he will understand cause and effect (that actions will have an effect)....and if you've said "do you want to go to bed" and then followed up with it often enough...he will link the two.... it may also just be the intonation that you use when you say it.<br>  <br>  Just a suggestion.... I use "stop" instead of "no" for my daughter. As they get older it is more practical to have a direction instead of just a word they hate to hear (no). Especially if she is about to do something dangerous ...a sharp "stop" usually stops her in her tracks. Similarly as they get older, it is better to tell them what to do (e.g. please be quite) instead of what NOT to do (e.g. Please stop making so much noise) because they tend to listen to the main part of the sentence (so please stop making so much noise....is interpreted as make noise)|`|XYzWRPoLaa	I think at 7mos they are a bit young to grasp the concept of dicipline,  You have to ignore the tatraums and distract them or remove them from situations of trouble while telling them, "You can't throw toys..." or whatever.  But every child is different.  However, you should not ask him "Do you want to go in your bed" as if he had a say in the matter but more, "Pick up your toys or you have to go sit in your bed.".|`|AA11138222	Be careful about using his bed as punishment. He will look at his bedroom as a bad place, and you will have problems for years to come getting him to sleep in his room alone. Chance are when a 7 month old is "super grumpy" or "throwing a fit" it's because he needs something. Either he is tired, hungry, needs his diaper changed he might even be getting sick. The most discipline you should use at his age is to redirect him away from things he shouldn't be doing. Get him interested in something he is allowed to do.
f2ca550ba141680eff4abf0b4511313caa	this happened to my baby girl, i just keep rotating her and now its not as evident because their heads are so soft you have to switch them from side to side, just switch sides each night, i freaked as well and its my 3rd baby it never happened before so...i guess everything we do is trial and error, we don't know everything but we do our best.|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	lay him down facing the ceiling....also you can put a baby hat on him durng the day, that would help|`|c73QkZ2haa	The flat spot wont go away. You want to prevent it from getting worse so just make sure he doesnt spend alot of time on that side. My son has one on the left side cause he always sleeps on the left my doctor told me to get one of the roll thingies that hold them in place so he can sleep on his side. Just keep your eye on it. When his hair grows in it will disguise the flat spot but it wont go away.|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	Your baby is still young, which mean you can still shape his head. When my baby was that young, I would rotate after she went to sleep after her late night feedings. So I was rotating her every 3 hrs. Putting a rolled up blanket behind baby will help. Also, when I was her hair I rub my hands in a circular motion. I never did apply pressure; just gently rubbed.|`|SihmWU0Baa	cuz they been laying on one side to much thier head is still soft you have to make sure they are equl spent time on all sides|`|bf03f3398ae59403fb987824b585b742aa	My daughter always slept in the same position and got a flat spot on the right side at the back of her head. She was a little older though(4 months). I was so worried I took her the paed...he told me that when she was sitting on her own then it would correct itself. He told me to try rotate her every few nigh.My daughter sits now and enjoys tummy time alot more. I have also moved her crib which made her sleep the other side more often. Her head is alot better now. I think if you change the position every few nights to get him used to different sleeping positions then he should be Fine. if you are really worried though...take him to his doc and get a prof opinion.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|VGueFw4gaa	Alternate sides, this article suggests moving crib for baby's interest.  My opinion is 3 days on left side, then 1 on right until better.  A 3-week old baby's head is still so soft, it shouldn't take long.  And do tummy-time when he can hold his head up.

Counties were selected by Generation Rescue. Interviews were successfully completed in 11,817 households with one or more children age 4 to 17. From those 11,817 households, data on 17,674 children was gathered. Of the 17,674 children inventoried, 991 were described as being completely unvaccinated. For each unvaccinated child, a health battery was administered.<br>  <br>  Generation Rescue chose to use telephone interviews with parents to gather data on children, so as to closely mirror the methodology the CDC uses to establish national prevalence for NDs such as ADHD and autism through their national phone survey of parent responses. Generation Rescue chose to focus on children ages 4-17 to match the age range used by CDC.<br>  <br>  Are parent responses a reliable indicator of a child's diagnostic status? According to Dr. Laura Schieve, co-author of the CDC's national phone survey study, in discussing the CDC's two phone surveys on autism prevalence, "the consistency of prevalence estimates across the two surveys supports high reliability or reproducibility of parental report of autism and reliability is one important component of validity."<br>  <br>  SurveyUSA is a well-known national opinion research firm with unique expertise in canvassing local communities. SurveyUSA has no vested interest in any outcome this or any survey might produce. You can see a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey here. The data the survey intended to capture included:<br>  -  Households with a child or children aged 4-17<br>  -  Whether or not that child had been vaccinated<br>  -  Whether or not that child had any one (or more) of the following diagnosis: ADD, ADHD, Asperger's, PDD-NOS, Autism, Asthma, or Juvenile Diabetes (the final two of which were added to consider other health outcomes).<br>  <br>  The results of the survey allowed us to compare the prevalence (what percentage of children have a particular diagnosis) to see if there was any meaningful difference between unvaccinated and vaccinated children.<br>  <br>  The most common way to measure prevalence differences is through a calculation known as relative risk or the Risk Ratio, where we compared prevalence amongst unvaccinated children to prevalence amongst vaccinated children. So, if 5% of unvaccinated children have asthma, and 10% of vaccinated children have asthma, that represents an "RR" of 2.0 (10%/5%), or a difference of 100%. We were also able to look at the data by gender, age, and county.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Recently it has been said that autism is not caused by the mmr. here is a really good web site for you.<br>  <br>  www.thinktwice.com.<br>  <br>  It has information and other peoples personal experience.

It was a vicious rumour that papers like the Sun managed to spread. It should be in your best interests to protect your children from these terrible diseases. There's "herd immunity" but that doesn't mean your child won't come in to contact with the disease. You can't just rely on other mothers to get their children vaccinated so you don't have to.|`|qayCggxMaa	Conspiracy theorists may disagree, but I think the best information is on the Center for Disease Control (CDC)'s web page.  See <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/</a><br>  <br>  Another website which may be of interest is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System at <a href="http://vaers.hhs.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://vaers.hhs.gov/</a>  That system has online databases that you can access of all adverse reactions to vaccines reported to the government.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	The problem is the isn't much reliable information on the subject.  There is as much info out there saying it is dangerous as there is saying it is safe.  You'll see articles in the news saying that they've determined that the MMR vaccine is not linked to autism but if you look you can find a lot that says it is.  I have been told that Dr Sears Vaccine book can be very helpful, but I have yet to read it myself.<br>  The most popular website I see being referred to on the subject is this one <a href="http://www.vaccinetruth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vaccinetruth.org/</a>|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Hold on a second, I have a link to the CDC about it somewhere...<br>  There it is. And please, get your child vaccinated, it does not cause autism or anything like that. Did you know not getting them vaccinated will cause the illnesses to become more common? Just because people don't get a disease anymore doesn't mean the disease is gone, it just means we are protected. If you child isn't protected, they will almost certainly get something that could have been avoided, like whooping cough. Be a responsible parent and get the vaccines.<br>  <br>  With the second link, you can order (for free)  a pamphlet explaining vaccines.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	There is no reliable information to show that vaccinations are linked to autism. There is some information out there showing that multiple vaccinations at the same time may lead to autism - there was a little girl who was given multiple shots to catch up on the vaccination schedule and she developed autism, so doctors are cautioning against doing that until there are further studies.<br>  <br>  I searched high and low for information about vaccinations leading to autism, and wasn't able to find any reliable ones. So you'll need to go with your gut. I ended up getting my baby vaccinated but on a drawn-out schedule. He only gets one at a time. There is information out there about delayed vaccinations, you can look that up.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	There was recently news about this . . . all that scare talk about shots causing Autism and seizures was nonsense.  I remember when my kids were babies . . . I had also heard these things.  I asked my doctor.  He explained to me that the risk of those things happening was far less than the risk of what could happen if my baby was NOT immunized.  Furthermore, all of his children were immunized.  I figured he knew more than I did, and if he got his kids immunized, that was the way for me to go.  All of mine were immunized and they're all doing great!
PqcEjB0Oaa	you should be happy that they are getting along better,and it will take a while to get over the jealousy, but it sounds like you need to go out and do something with your sister.

wWyChyYiaa	If you don't want to spend the money on the ovulation test kits, the best thing to do would be to count the possible days of ovulation.  If you have a "normal" 28 day cycle, you will most likely ovulate on or around the 14th day of your cycle.  My best advice would be to start having sex on day 10 of your cycle and then every other day for approximately 10 days (so you would be having sex 5 times).  You would have sex on day 10, day 12, day 14, day 16, and day 18.  This would cover 99% of the days that most women would ovulate.  By having sex every other day you also let the man's sperm have enough of a chance to really recooperate.  It will let the sperm build up again.  So in your instance you would have sex today, on the 22nd, on the 24th, on the 26th, and on the 28th.  This will give you ample chance to conceive.  All this baring in mind that you are ovulating and that his sperm count is adequate.<br>  <br>  Some tips:  Cinnamon has been known to increase sperm count, as well as oysters.  Afternoon sex has the most potency.  keep a pillow under your butt during/after you are done (it raises your pelvis)  stay lying on your back for approximately 20 minutes after he finishes.<br>  <br>  If you do this for 3-6 months and have still not conceived you may want to talk to your doctor.  There is also a really great book out on the market now called "Stirrups Aren't Just For Horses" by Janean Buyny.  It is fantastic.  It talks you through each step of the process.  It answers every question imaginable, and she talks in real terms.  It is very easy to understand and to read.  It in not a medical book...it can actually be quite funny in some parts.<br>  <br>  So I wish you luck....if you have questions don't be afraid to ask....and GOOD LUCK!!<br>  <br>  Keep us posted!!|`|fYMWDQLGaa	don skip ur food. take healthy foods. try taking prenatal vitamins wit DHA n Folic acid.  buy OPKs(strips) from ebay. it really works and affordable too|`|bKK2fPiVaa	Try www.mymonthlycycles.com to help you claculate when you ovulate and all that jazz.<br>  I am also planning on ordering ovulation test strips on eBay to help me determine when I ovulate because lately my cycle has been out of whack!<br>  If you hear of any other "secrets" let me know... I want a baby :)<br>  Good luck and baby dust!!|`|cyrfDuo5aa	this is to THEBIGTED.... obviously you know nothing.. You don't think women have tried "not using a condom" for some it is easy to get pregnant while for others like myself it seems to be a hopeless battle. People like you make me want to cry because you have no compassion. This is the "trying to conceive" section, so if you have nothing insightful to say then leave. And to the asker, I would invest in an ovulation kit, they work! If you dont want to do that then google "ovulation calender" and you can get a good idea of fo when you ovulate! Good luck and baby dust!!!!!!|`|Dh19fHj4aa	dont use a condom you council estate man. did you go to school ............ obviously no
HQ5R1p9qaa	if he's asking to see her and she's in a stable environment i think you should let him|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I think they should but I can't say anything and be firm on it cause I don't know what it is like to give a child up nor have a child through that type of situation...I would say it is up to you when you think that he is ready...I agree with one of the other posts how about web cams...|`|X6as2nOAaa	Personally I think you should take a visit he is not too young he knows what is going on and he just wants a visit so why not let him? I think if he knows that he wants to see her then he wants to so let him.|`|6L9jJnchaa	It all readlly depends on if you feel like driving/flying out there.  You can always explain to him that the trip is expensive and you can take it as a family vacation some other time.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I suggest you set up cameras on everybody's computer.  That way, she's just someone on the screen, but his curiosity is assauged.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|A9etUnnfaa	yes|`|BTuFtui3aa	I think it would be a good thing for your son. It's normal for him to be curious about the woman who gave birth to him, and seeing her and getting to know her would probably benefit him a lot. This is clearly important to him if he keeps bringing it up.<br>  <br>  You can't be 100% sure she's alright with the visit since you can't read her mind, but I'm would bet she cares very much about your/her son. It's very likely she wants to see him. By all means encourage her to be honest with you about her feelings, but she's an adult who can speak her own mind-- so take her answer at face value.<br>  <br>  If there's any way you can manage it, I think a visit would be positive and helpful for your son.

dFHsAXDMaa	As a nurse and a mother of 4 I can honestly say No it is not normal for her to still be wearing a nappie/ diaper to bed. Girls are not normal bed wetters while boys can wet the bed for years due to slow kidney maturity. I would try explaining to your daughter that she is a big girl and does not need the nappie for bed and that if she has to pee at night she needs to be a big girl and get up and use the potty. if she is wetting the bed at night you might want to stop drinks an hour or so before bed and make sure she goes potty before going to sleep.<br>  <br>  No offense but most kids wwho are wearing nappies at that age is bue to parents being too lazy to deal with the issues and training involved in teaching them to be nappy free. <br>  <br>  if bed wetting is really a big issue consult pediatrician, there are many underlying issues that can cause bed wetting one of tthe most common is trama and fear, sexual abuse.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I don't think so....i no a 8 year old who still wears a nappie! Her mother is very lazy!! I think they get to old by the time they are 4-41/2|`|1ezYfkX7aa	At 6years old it is not normal. I would make her a doc appt and find out whats going on thats causing her to be wetting the bed still.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	The fact that you are asking the question suggests that you already know the answer.<br>  <br>  No, it is not normal. You aught to talk to your GP and train her to go to the loo in the night.|`|I2iNfYCyaa	That's completely strange..|`|OI3bf4yjaa	No, it is not normal.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	No, it is not.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Occasionally some children have a problem with waking to a bladder call, but they are usually well able to take themselves to the loo in the middle of the night by the time they are six.<br>  We moved house just after my daughter's 3rd birthday and by that time she was getting out of bed and taking herself to the loo if she needed to go.|`|hWe8vhKKaa	Dont listen to them some children be slow at learning , thas because when your child sleeps she cant realy sence when she needs the loo .but not giving her drinks a hour before bed and make her go to the loo before going to bed.slowly she will learn.<br>  go to the docs he will give vitimens wish it works out.|`|1EHX6fQ7aa	I was in nappies to bed when I was 6 and I'm fine. By the time I was seven I didn't need to wear them anymore. Go to the doctor if you think it's weird but I assure you, it's probably not. ;-(|`|geuF7GsHaa	no, she is in kindergarden or first grade!<br>  Tell her that she is a big girl.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I think you already know the answer to this question. No, it's not normal.|`|wkuCydzRaa	No. Potty train her. Poor kid.|`|4yGGjs7zaa	no this isnt normal! try talking to your doctor he may have some suggestions!|`|5lt9NV2yaa	Its normal for your child, every child is different, some can still wet the bed well into their teens, at which point the doctors help is required! Being 6yrs she might even feel embarrassed about it herself, but she's still only 6. You can buy pull up pants that still do the same job as nappies, but she can feel a bit more grown up about wearing them as she will be able to pull them on and off herself, and this may also give her some encouragement. Also don't give her any drinks about an hour- hour and half before she goes to bed, and take her to the toilet before she goes to bed. What you can also do is wake her during the night, such as when you go to bed and take her to the toilet again then put her straight back to bed. Not all children at this age can wake themselves during the night if they need the loo! Hopefully in the morning you will find she is dry. You will have to stick to the routine until her bladder has retrained itself and she can go the whole night!<br>  Hope this helps, although it can be a hard time for parents and kids, don't worry you don't have an abnormal child!|`|B7iSU8UYaa	A 6 year old should be able to sleep dry through the night. Try to limit drinks before bedtime and talk to her about using the potty at night if she feels the need. Also don't use nappies, since she won't feel wet and uncomfortable, which will encourage her to use the bathroom at night. Just use a waterproof sheet on her bed to protect the mattress. <br>  <br>  It can be a difficult issue and hard to tell without more information whether it is a physical or emotional problem. Definitely ask your pediatrician for help with this, since she may not have a developed bladder etc. It will be peace of mind for you both to have it checked.<br>  Good luck!|`|F4XaPnXHaa	Hi, its not normal but i found that when i was potty training my daughter to stay dry at night i would wake her after about 4 hours of sleep take her to the toilet in silence then once she had been i would take her back to bed.  She never remembered it the next morning and it did not take long till she would wake herself up and go to the bathroom on her own.  There may be a few accidents but if you dont make a big deal out of accidents but reward the dry nights with praise and stickers or something then it may be really quick.  good luck with it all|`|yxfxzIrFaa	Look, its not normal, but don't worry, you can buy material to go under the sheets of her bed, as you are training her, but if i was you i would get her out of the nappies as soon as possible, it can't be healthy in the long run...|`|AHSjo9omaa	Not at all honey, but to be honest, if as a mum you havent potty trained her, it's kinda your own fault!<br>  <br>  Why havent you trained her and stuck at it?<br>  <br>  It's you that puts her nappy on everynight!|`|l7U9dGrWaa	no it not normal but is because you haven't trained her or medical reason|`|WQ8P57o3aa	No that is not at all good. <br>  She needs to grow up into a big girl, she's not a baby.|`|FqtxAyLsaa	hell no, she is way to old and needs to see a doctor.
hNr3GFvlaa	It is definitely normal for your daughter.<br>  <br>  If she's insistent on you doing it for her and you want her to do it herself, you can communicate just that. Observe her reaction and try to detect if she has feelings around it (maybe she doesn't like it or she has a ritual she doesn't want to break etc.) Then see if you can help her meet the genuine need driving the behavior in another way.<br>  <br>  If it is a ritual, you can approach it in parts. Maybe you can still come in the bathroom when she's doing it herself.<br>  <br>  I would definitely stay away from rewards and punishment, and try to stay emotionally connected to her and understand what she really feels and needs.<br>  <br>  It is possible that she's just not ready yet. Still, if you are tired of doing it, I would recommend of having an honest conversation with an honest request for her to try it. Of course, making a request and not demand means that you are open to hearing a "no"  and continuing helping her for a little while.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Have fun outside of the bathroom without her and let her know that after she wipes herself she can come and join in on the fun.  Has she started school yet?  Ask her who is going to wipe her when she is at school?  Gently remind her that the other kids in her class will be wiping themselves and that she should be a big girl like them too.  You definitely want to break her out of this habit just for that reason.  You don't want her screaming on the toilet while at school!|`|5r7RAgXuaa	My brother got my mom to wipe his bum until he was 8.|`|veO1RXrCaa	My son is 6 and will on occasion ask me to do it.  I tell him no and that he is too big a boy for that.  I think he does it to see what I will say.  :) As for your daughter refuse to do it.  That's what I had to do when he was younger too.  After he got trapped on the can a few times he got the point.  You can try rewards.  But I didn't feel that should be on his reward chart.  It was a basic human function that he needed to do on his own.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Let her scream and sit on the toilet if she won't do it herself.  The more you come rushing in to wipe it, the longer she won't do it.  Just ignore her and tell her she's old enough to wipe herself.  She'll get tired of sitting there eventually.|`|Xc02z608aa	Sticker charts or another reward system for doing it all herself.  Maybe after she gets so many stickers she gets a special treat or prize.  Kids love temporary tattoos.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Buy a bag of tootsie rolls or suckers. And every time she goes to the bathroom (number 2) ALL BY HERSELF then she gets a treat.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	She will keep asking as long as you keep doing it.  Try to make it fun for her, make a song and a dance and tell her how big she is when she does it herself.  Try to get those Can-do (or whatever they are called with the frog on them) wipes, and tell her they are big kid wipes.  At 5 she should be able to do it herself, she just doesn't want to and most kids are that way.  I bought those wipes for my son when he was that age, and he was so excited to have them, and he did it himself every time after that!|`|AA12110742	hi, my daughter has just gotten out of this stage.<br>  <br>  What i found helped was going to the toilet with her as usual then gettng her to wipe her bum and then check she's ok. <br>  I think this reasured her that she was doing a good job and that she could actually do it herself. <br>  HTH|`|g5pKK4Zraa	Sorry to say, but you have to be more strict with her.  Even if that means she sits on the toilet all day screaming!  She will soon learn that you wont and she will clean herself.

You have to be tough to be kind.|`|27eb1d482ab9a7d18f38ee9e8c1837a0aa	don't tell her off for this as it could make it worse, maybe there is a fear she has, try talking to her to find out why she cant do it herself, hopefully she will open up and tell you.<br>  it is normal for children up to the age of 6 or 7 to still have some toilet issues etc so don't worry to much just yet.<br>  good luck x|`|8580a00b8928b21b7e2a1300aeb99f4faa	Stop doing it.

9dDKr0Abaa	Our first son was born at 28wks and passed away 3 hours after birth. I always look at pictures of my son and tell them that's there big brother. My son and daughter are 2 and 1. My son understands that he has a big brother and that we visit him at the cemetery but he doesn't understand the concept of death. I would wait till your kids start asking you about it, that is what I plan on doing. Also there are a lot of books out there that you can read to your kids. There is one called We Were Gonna Have a Baby but we had an Angel instead By: Pat Schweibert<br>  <br>  (((BIG HUGS)))|`|eQFUFAZaaa	I think you should wait until they are mature enough to handle the news and grasp the full idea of death.  Right now you may scare them.  Talking to their pediatrician is a good idea as well.  He/she should be able to give you some great advice on broacing this subject with the kiddos.<br>  <br>  Death is a very hard topic with kids.  One that is usually left untouched until older years.|`|JDJjGdEuaa	DON'T TELL THEM! WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU DO THAT?|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I would wait till they ask why you put flowers on this persons grave...then by that time they should be old enough to comprehend if they are asking about it...good luck|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Only when they are much older.  They won't understand right now and time isn't of the essence.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I think it's better when they're older and can understand the concept of death. The two year olds might be a bit young. You could tell the four year old and then later talk to the others about it. <br>  <br>  My mom divulged to me when I was 18 that my dad had another child before I was born. While the child didn't die, I know nothing about this person or his 'former life,' and was quite upset. I'm not sure I've even come to terms with it yet, but rather sort of suppressed it, in a way. It doesn't bother me as much now, but at the time I was crushed. <br>  <br>  I would tell them when you think they're ready to understand it. But don't try to hide it from them.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I would wait till they are older....I had a baby that was born prematurely and didn't make it before I had my other two kids.  We have a stone with his foot prints and a dedication on it and one day one of my kids noticed it (after five or six years...LOL) and I explained it to them.  Stay matter of fact and try to find something positive, or it will scare them silly worrying that something will happen to them too.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! and sorry for your loss.|`|a5dPOyNbaa	Tell them when they're older. Take them to the cemetary and someday they'll ask who she is.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I would tell them when they are older. I don't think they would actually understand fully Maybe wait till they know the meaning of death.|`|Yl3C9svGaa	That is an extremely hard question. At this age, I would wait unless they are asking questions. If you go to the cemetery and they ask why, tell them the truth. I wouldn't volunteer the information yet - they may be too young to properly grasp death and it could start new fears - what if I/sister/brother/mommy/daddy etc. die? I would wait until they have the ability to process what it means.  <br>  <br>  When you decide the time is right as far as their ages, then talk to them before you go to take flowers to the grave. Tell them her name, explain (within their understanding) what happened to her, and then go on to your personal beliefs about death (if you believe she is watching over them, tell them).|`|1G3XPiq3aa	I would just be very straight forward about it. Kids are amazingly accepting at that age. I talk about my dead relatives with my 4 year old daughter, and while she sort of knows it's appropriate to frown and look sad about it, it doesn't really get to her, and it's something she'll bring up and ask stories about that person.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	When they start asking who you are visiting at the cemetery.  You just tell them that when mommy was younger, she had had another baby but that baby had to go to heaven or whatever it is you want them to believe in.<br>  <br>  Simple is always better with young children.  As they age they'll get more inquisitive.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I would tell them when they can start to understand what the cemetery is exactly. This will probably be in the next few years for the 4 year old, maybe even sooner than that. Explain to them when they ask.. Sorry for your loss.|`|BlKSDPToaa	Start now. Little kids just accept stuff. It won't be a big deal to them. It's better for them to know than to spring it on them later.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry about Jamie.|`|TuRO6QHlaa	The next time you go just explain that this was there older sister from along time ago and that God wanted her with him and the Angels.|`|j65rSZ26aa	I would agree with the first poster. They honestly don't know what's going on. they are way too young to know the meaning of death. Wait until they start asking you questions|`|KWaTVVpGaa	When you go to the cemetary let them know that that is where their big sister is buried.
wWyChyYiaa	I know that this time period can be very stressful, but please don't waste your money on taking a test yet.  With all the stress of trying to conceive many women start having a little bit of irregularity in their periods.  What you need to do is wait until approximately 2 weeks after you were supposed to have your period...and then test.<br>  Alot of times if you don't give your body enough time, the test may even come out as a false negative (even with all the claims that some of the pregnancy tests make).  So...give your body time and relax.  The last thing you need is stress on your body.<br>  <br>  If you want a really great book to read or get information about trying to conceive...check out "Stirrups Aren't Just For Horses" by Janean Buyny.  It is a phenomenal book that is really easy to read.  It tells you step by step what you need to do to make the process of conceiving easier.  Plus she talks in "real-women's" terms.  It is not medicinal...just makes how to plan having a baby a whole lot easier.  It will answer every question that you have.|`|AA11764194	Go ahead take the test.. you are already late will get the accurate result<br>  <br>  Good luck and loads of baby dust|`|vigFmfLmaa	Sure, if you're already late you can take a test.  It's perfectly normal to test after missing your expected period.  It sounds as if you're experiencing PMS with the cramps.  I would do that and then just as soon as I tested AF would start!|`|bT5dhhQXaa	Hiya,<br>  <br>  You should do a test anyway just so you know.<br>  <br>  I had the same sort of scenario as you a couple of months back, I had my last period starting on 30th November, then no period until 12th of Jan, I was so sure that I was pregnant but had negative HPTs, so then I got my period and thought well I'm not pregnant then.<br>  <br>  The disappointment each month was driving me crazy literally, so I thought I need to chill out and not think about it so much (believe me I know this is so hard to do, and the worse thing is people telling you not to try so hard!!!) but then this month my period was a little late again, I didn't think anything of it as my periods lately seem to be VERY irregular, so we popped to the chemist on the way home one night, used to HPT, got ready for the BFN, and guess what, a little positive sign popped up, i didn't believe it myself for a few hours.<br>  <br>  So I'd say, keep trying and go for it!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ce8COixxaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's wonderful news and so exciting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How are you going to tell him???
Fsr2Rofzaa	well if this man was so bad and GASP!! he's black, why the heck did you lie with him in the first place.  In my opinion I think you should have the baby, you wouldn't be the first woman to have a baby under these circumstaces.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I find it pretty hard to believe that you didnt know any of that about your childs father until after you got pregnant. I guess you have alot to sit down and  think about. You can either continue with the pregnancy and keep it, or give it up for adoption...or have the abortion. By the looks....the father isnt go to help out at all.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	It's simple; you become a single mother.  Thousands of women are single moms and do just fine.  Just because the dad is a dead beat doesn't mean you can't have your baby.|`|8WRnqs08aa	My oldest son will be 18 in Sept. He has never known his biological dad, but he knows about him, has the option to call him if he wants to and is in contact with the two sisters that live with his biological father.<br>  <br>  My son carries no scars from not knowing his biological father. I have never said anything bad to him about his biological father either. Is he curious? I'm sure he is, but it seems to me that he still has no interest in knowing this man as his father, but he does want to know his sisters. To him I think it's like his biological father is just the father of two of his friends (which happen to be his 1/2 sisters).<br>  <br>  You need to look out for the best interest of your child. If it means that he will not play an active part in your baby's life, then you need to do what you need to do. Just handle it in a civilized manner in the courts and abide by whatever decision the court makes, whether or not you are in total agreement.<br>  <br>  Push for supervised visits if the father even desires a relationship with the baby. I was fortunate to have my sons biological father give me full custody and he agreed to visitations & child support. He's $25,000 in arrears and has never executed his right to arrange visitations.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mother of 4 beautiful children with Twins due 09/10/09|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	it's not up to YOU whether his visits are supervised sorry. Now you know to get to know someone before having unprotected sex. What if he had an STD. Use you're head and you won't have to ask for advise like this. good luck.|`|pcdEb8kMaa	I don't believe in abortions personally,but I don't judge people B/C I don't know what they deal with or are going through to have these thoughts.However this guy sounds bad and if it were me I wouldn't see him anymore.No job,license,car and lives at home in and out of jail, drug dealer etc......sounds like hes not father or family material to me.Best of luck on your choice.you sound as though you know what you want already.Do what you think is best.|`|gb4VzNXQaa	Since you are religious just pray about it.  See if you can find some counseling that will help you to make the best decision.  Good luck.|`|3tuwWidiaa	Stop.<br>  <br>  You should NOT expect to limit the father's access to the child and ask for child support.<br>  <br>  What you should do is petition the court, once the child is born (since you cannot do before) that this man would be a danger to the child and you should get full custody.  You should make it clear, however, that you do not want child support.  A judge will then decide.<br>  <br>  After that, you should kiss your mother's feet for the support she's given you and ask her to help you.<br>  <br>  You should get a job.  Or another job.  At the very least until the baby comes.  Put all the extra money you earn into a bank account and spend NONE of it before then.<br>  <br>  If you don't want an abortion, don't get one.  But you need to take full responsibility for this child, particularly if you don't want to be with the father.<br>  <br>  I only hope that "school" means college and not high school.  If it's college, then you should drop out and get a full time job.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	As hard as it may be, you can make it as a single mother. You can sue the father for child support, sometimes this means the father has to right to visitation, but in this case with him being a drug dealer I'm sure the courts wouldn't allow him visitation. Especially if he is a convict. Adoption is your second option. It is a very hard thing to do, but in many cases you can do an open adoption. That's where you can still visit and see your child after it is adopted. Third, abortion is murder, and I strongly oppose it. I also feel like you would really regret it later in life if you chose that route. Babies are  a blessing from GOD, not always a planned blessing, and you may not see it now. But give it time, and things will work out for the best. There are many state funded programs that can help you as a single mother, especially one in school. You can get a medical card to pay for your pregnancy expenses, and one for your child when it is born. You can get WIC assistance to help with food while you're pregnant and milk afterwards when the baby is born. You can get child care assistance to help you with daycare while you go to school. There are so many programs aimed at helping single young mothers care for their children. Consult with a counselor at your local social services office, and they will be able to help you. DO NOT CONSIDER ABORTION!|`|LWvh2g2maa	Well why did you sleep with this person?  Anyways, damage done.  I highly doubt he has 8 different personalities.  If he did, he's be in a mental hospital so that's just bull.  You can get supervised visitation if you feel he is a possible danger to your child.  Then you won't be taking away his rights as a father and your child's rights to know his father.  And don't worry about being able to support your baby because that's what welfare is for.  You can just ride on our tax paying coat tails.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	There's a lot of single mothers in this world and the kids are just fine. Eventually he'll ask for his father and your going to have to tell him, but if the court decides that he could see him then why not let him! I would do all the supervising too, since he is a drug dealer.|`|h9AaGIYEaa	I think you should keep the baby.<br>  You helped create it too.<br>  Keep faith and everything will work out ok.<br>  I also say move on from the father. You dont need to be together to raise a child. The courts will see that he helps you out. If not, hopefully one day you will meet a man who will be more than willing to accept you with your child.|`|lR40HgdEaa	yes you are being irrational you are a perfect example for the reason abortion should be legal in every state you know the father is a horrible person you seem like a very rational person why bring a baby into the world that can not be loved and will endure hardship for many years because of the type of guy he is  ........................................... then again your the type of person that would sleep with a guy like this so the kid is doomed either way|`|oaJcgz3uaa	Your child won't be scarred from not knowing his or her father.  While it may affect him/her in ways that a child with two parents may not experience, it's not like the baby will be destined to be miserable, or homeless, what have you.  We all encounter and overcome different hardships.  Personally, and from what I've studied in school, your child will be better off with a stable life style than an erratic interation with an unreliable father.  Do what you feel is right, whatever that may be.<br>  <br>  On a side note - I'm sure this is not what you actually meant, but just in case - you shouldn't look at your baby as someone that will love you unconditionally, or at all.  That's a lot of unnecessary expectation to put on a baby or young child, and a lot of children don't express love or affection for their parents (especially in the teen years).  Countless young girls look forward to having babies because they want someone to love them, but it just doesn't really work that way.  <br>  <br>  Just in case you're still a little unsure about adoption, you might want to consider a private adoption with a family you know.  It's rare, but sometimes people adopt to neighbors, or friends of the family, and are still able to have a relationship with the baby, meanwhile knowing that the baby is going to a good family.  Just something to think about.|`|0a931d251e569a4d6a05c6a5cf00742aaa	There is one thing i really have to set you straight on. It will NOT scar your baby to not know its father. I am 26 and have never met my father. I have an 8 year old son and I was 17 when i had him. My son's biological father sounds a lot like this baby's father.<br>  <br>  I have not even heard from his "sperm donor" since I told him I was pregnant and I thank my lucky starts for that everyday. I am married now and have been with my husband since my son was 1.<br>  <br>  Trust me, if you don't think you can give the baby up DON'T! You may regret it. You sound like a very responsible woman and you have a great plan for you and the baby. I think you will manage just fine when you have the baby!<br>  <br>  It isn't easy but it's worth it to keep your baby, once you see him/her you will do anything you can to keep and protect it. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I think it is wonderful that you are against abortion! I wish everyone looked at it as a little life. Good for you!<br>  If you don't think you could go through with a regular adoption, maybe you could look into an open adoption? where you could see the baby or pictures of the baby on a regular basis.<br>  If you don't think you can do that, then Keep the baby! No judge is going to grant parental rights to a drug dealer. Use whatever info you have to keep the baby away from him! H doesn't sound like he is any good.<br>  There are rescourses for low income parents. there is WIC which you can get even while you are pregnant. There are other government programs designed to help you! Try to find a crisis pregnancy center (NOT planned parenthood) in your area, and see if they can give you more specific information. Good Luck!|`|YcwMK5Pbaa	First of all I have to tell you that I am biased....<br>  <br>  My mom was 15 when she got pregnant, 16 when she married the father, my dad.<br>  <br>  Later in life I learned that he constantly abused her, and I did witness it a few times myself.  The reason my mom told me this is because his "bad habits" were now against me.... <br>  They divorced about 11 years ago.<br>  <br>  The moral of the story....<br>  Just because the dad is an ***, and doesn't know how to take care of his family, doesn't mean you should give up on this child.  I am that child. I have thanked my mom SO many times for not giving up on me, even tho I got the **** end of the deal for a few years.<br>  <br>  So no, I don't think you should have an abortion.  My kids wouldn't be here if my mom had....
E7ViD8EWaa	Apologize profusely, and come up with a way to make up for it. <br>  (extra chores, doing all the cooking, etc.)|`|BJERgbM5aa	Once your grounded, parents tend to be pretty stubborn about it.  Sometime, when things are calmer, try a sane negotiation.  Not only apologize profusely, tell why you raised your voice and that you don't know how you could have done such a thing, and then offer to do double chores for the next or remainder of the week.  And tell them that their love and their respect is very important to you.  And the love and respect of your friend is also important.  Dropping a tear wouldn't hurt.  Not gushing a tear.  Just a drop or two.  Good Luck.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Make it up to your mom. Ask to be let off tonight, and make her breakfast in bed tomorrow. Or have a girly night in with her tomorrow. just make it up to her in some way.<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|DJpS9GDxaa	shoulda thought about that before you showed an attitude...sorry!<br>  <br>  "It's not what you say, it's how you say it."<br>  In the same way, showing an attitude while doing chores is just as bad as not doing chores at all|`|6gthdHpnaa	Well, you should have thought about that before you were disrespectful. Sorry, that's life.|`|MXnSWKCkaa	i guess ur just gonna have to take the punishment :( but next time dont be disrespectful good luck|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	I would need to know your mom personaly to find a weak point in her character, all I can tell you is that if you can't do the time don't do the crime, yes you did your chores but you did them in a moody way and you disrespected your mom and actually yelled at her, how do you expect that forgets all that so easily? just as in every other aspect of life there's no easy ways out of responsibilities.|`|cd3d6652026769d6c622057ae1142194aa	I don't really know you or your moms relationship, but if you go downstairs and apologize and MEAN it when you say it, and then tell her you're sorry again and won't do it again, I'm sure she'll let you out of being grounded.  Sometimes all it takes is an apology =)|`|O5KOwhovaa	You must never disrespect your mother. You should have done your chores and you deserve to be grounded. Hopefully, the punishment will teach you a valuable lesson. You've got to have rules and regulations, to keep you on the right path. If your mother is reading this I say well done and stick to your guns mom!|`|49LiABmvaa	apologize<br>  just be like mom i was disrespectful and i'm sorry. i know that there's no good reason for me to go to the game but i would really appreciate it if you let me go. i need to be there for *insert friend's name here* i can't let her down.|`|PqcEjB0Oaa	there is no way of geting out of it unless you ask your parents to do another punishement(something harsher) for tommorow or something. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, your screwed!|`|5c29536e08a5b98c6451c88a20d06461aa	Sit down and talk to her.  The answer is most likely no but it could not hurt.  <br>  <br>  PS:  you did this to yourself by yelling at her...|`|8umXlm1Jaa	Go and undo the freakin chores, and then complain when you get attitude about it. you'll feel better.|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	Apologize depending on her personality and her strict she is... if she is? Maybe she will unground you.|`|Ga5Wcaj5aa	Ask her to sit down and talk with you privately.Tell her that you want her to listen to everything you say before she interrupts or the like.Then tell how important the game is to you and how you made a promise to a friend.Then say something along the lines of,"I know i messed up and it just kind of slipped and I am very sorry for what i said earlier it was completely uncalled for"Then tell after she tells you no or yes that you would like for both of you to talk more and talk things through so you can better understand eachother's sides of the story.I ran away from home last year and one day at my dad's(i ran away from my mom's)i realized that i needed her and she probably needed me and that if we hadn't been yelling at each other all the time we probably would of understood each other better and wouldn't be in this mess.Oh and one more thing.DONT YELL.EVER.stay calm,dont whine.Take it like a man...or woman and act like an adult.I'm also fifteen,but how can you exact respect from each other if you don't take time to understand each other.|`|gA22md42aa	You are 15 you had an attitude and was yelling and being disrespectful towards your mom.  Grounded that's all you got? You still have access to computer while grounded? <br>  <br>  I totally understand how some eat their young.<br>  <br>  Man oh man if you were my daughter you would be homeless by the first time you rolled your eyes at me ever!<br>  <br>  Ok how to solve this problem....to never get Grounded ever again. Sorry you just dig yourself a really deep hole.. I don't see any way you could get out of it. You are even justifying what you said to your mom as not being bad! For now you have to reconcile with your mom ask her what it was you told her and genuinely apologize for misbehaving and being a shame to the person who gave birth to you, fed and raised you. Think about it, your mom might have been a happier person without a burden like you around.  I say burden coz she has to provide and care for you.  If you were matured and would lift your own weight... then she wouldn't have to discipline you on top of all the other things she has to do for you--coz you are an adult!   When an adult makes a mistake, all you have to do is talk about it and figure ways to do better next time.<br>   <br>  You got to fix your attitude in general.  Don't get all pout-y if things don't go your way coz... things won't always go your way.  Acne on your first real date.  your mascara runs. your heal breaks. spill coffee on your shirt.  More likely your friends had something to do with influencing you with your outlook in life,so you might want to have friends who influence you for the better. Maybe this is also why your mom chooses tat you don't go to this girls event. Make sure your mom knows all of your friends... have them hang out at your house from time to time to meet your mom. This would help you in your later years.<br>  <br>  You need to show your mom that you are an adult. Domineering your mom by intimidating her with your sassy attitude isn't being grown up... it is childish. And children need guidance therefore they get GROUNDED.  To show your mom that you are a responsible adult, you will do things without being asked, you will be responsible for your living space (bedroom, bathroom, living room, etc.)  Clean up after yourself. Don't leave your things laying around.  Don't expect your mom to wake you up for school.  Come home way before curfew - if you have any and if you don't have a curfew- tell your mom where you are going, who you will be with, and what time you expect to be home .... give yourself an extra 20-30 mins. just in case you hit a snag. For example.... you are going to the mall at 1pm then to the movies at 3pm.  movies end at 5pm tell her you'll be home at 7pm  just incase you go for ice cream after movies-but get home at 6:30pm just to show her that you are true to your word.just because you are expected at 7pm doesn't mean you have to be out till 7pm.  Coming home early -relaxed and not huffing- shows responsibility and maturity. keeping promises:)  <br>  <br>  Being out of the house means that you are not going to be home to take care of your responsibilities and see it as a privilege. It s not your right to be out.. it is a privilege that comes with your parents trusting you to behave yourself and not get in trouble and make the right decisions for your safety and well-being. Often tell your parents about your day and activities.  This way they know that you are having fun and enjoying your activities- they won't worry when you are out.  Also tell them of things that bothered you and ask guidance about it.  This way you bond more and they know they count in your life.<br>  <br>   So , to show maturity and being responsible around the house, ask if there is anything your mom would want you to do before you go.  For example, you come home from school at 4pm and you want to leave for some event at 6pm.  You know about this the day before.So, the moment you get up from bed in the morning, see if you could do a couple of things /chores before heading to school or the night before.  garbage, straighten your room, fix your bed for sure, feed the dog.  When you get home from school, do the rest of your chores(without waiting to be told) ask your mom if there is anything else she needs you to do or errands while you are out ... mail, pick something up at the grocery, drop off movies at Blockbuster, or library books. This shows that you care about things that go on at home even while you are out.  Very responsible!<br>  <br>  Show your mom that you are responsible and serious with your education . You get your homework done, you review for tests, you get really good grades. This shows that you don't need much guidance or help with school and you will succeed.<br>  <br>  If you get upset about something try to be calm.  Use your words wisely.  If your mom says that you are not allowed to do something.  Pause... Ask her why. Understand her point of view. Accept it without a fuss.  Control the tone in your voice.  You still live under her roof and you are her offspring.<br>  <br>  If you have siblings, be diplomatic and don't ever start a fight or be in one.  Just because they hit you doesn't mean you have to hit them back.  Hand them over to your parents coz they are children and children need to be disciplined for bad behavior.  It isn't your duty to discipline your siblings. if your parents are not around ignore them. <br>  <br>  Now here is the test.  How do you feel about what I posted here?   If you are kicking and screaming right now ... you do deserve to be GROUNDED a few more times coz you are still a child, hopefully at 18 you'll grow out of this childishness. If you get off the computer and start helping out around the house and treat your family nicer you might have really grown up!<br>  <br>  Good luck with growing up.
Sn2LhGBaaa	I like Malakai.  Kai is a great nickname too.  Malakai Antwon sounds awesome.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I think Kai has a good meaning in Hawaiian.<br>  <br>  Malakai is okay, a little different, okay different.  I don't like Malakai Antwon--their vowels run together.<br>  How about Marcello Antoine? (Mar CHEL lo).  I like that a lot.<br>  <br>  Marquel is not too bad.  Marquel Antoine is great.<br>  <br>  Why not Marquis (mar KEE)?<br>  <br>  Take care,<br>  TX Mom|`|6CjDTJskaa	malakai, definitely|`|Li9kuojFaa	Malakai i like that name it has like a nice ring to it hehe|`|hHDVBzG0aa	Dude Malakai is a totally righteous name :)|`|X6as2nOAaa	I like malakai|`|tmckNa4baa	In my opinion, I really like the name Marquel Antwon.

BUggf6otaa	i was scared ah hell.i couldnt tell my mom.& i still havent im about 9 weeks & with twins i think.ill wait till my scan.but my stomach is bloating out  like im 6 months pregnant.im still scared & yes expectin the worst.but the good thing is my boyfriends family are very supportive & im only 18.the best thing to do is think of the good things when you become a mom & imagine your baby.thats what i did & dats what kept me going but evryday im living in fear but yeah sooner my mom is going to know.just be positive & the important thing make the right decisions now.k.cheers.|`|oqJYAVzeaa	Well just put it this way all of us women most likely will go through it some day. If it wasnt planned yes it is scary at first but that will go away once you start thinking about the baby, you get excited and want to know what she or he will look like, You will worry about your baby being healthy. When you go shopping you will already want to shop for it without even knowing what its going to be. If you are alone in this and dont have the baby's father by your side talk to your loved ones they might be upset at first but they be with you through it.|`|0OB7yhCKaa	i was HELLA scared! i was only 20 and kinda a partier! so i was pretty scared and upset! but now he's here and he is the most amazing thing in the world! you fall in love so fast and it's the best feeling ever! like falling in love with a bf for the first time only BETTER haha! its scary now but you'll get used to it as you feel baby move and when it comes u'll be so happy! good luck|`|Khs7HBYmaa	FIRST YOU GOTTA FACE YOUR FEARS AND GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE TEST. I KNOW YOU MAY BE SCARED, BUT THE SOONER YOU FIND OUT THE MORE PREPARED YOU CAN BE.  AND IF THE TEST IS NEGATIVE JUST BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME. BUT IF IT IS POSITIVE, START PLANNING YOUR LIFE FROM THE TIME YOU FIND OUT. I HOPE YOU GET THE OUTCOME THAT YOU WANT.|`|AuVtUjVAaa	I was very happy to find out that I was pregnant, but also wondered if I was ready to have a baby.. do you have anyone you can talk to(siblings, friends, support group, parents)|`|sTAA8lthaa	Calm yourself down. Do you have any support? If you do have them with you when you find out. Good Luck!|`|SCY0bOr5aa	With my first born I was scared. I was not married, had a stable relationship though and we live in a tiny apartment. Everyone has there own fears about becoming pregnant, others have been waiting for a baby. Its all natural and motherhood will come natural too.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	No, I was ecstatic! Wait and see if you miss your period, if you do.. try taking a home pregnancy test.|`|fHgbL046aa	Take the test to be sure. Then decided what to do. I was scared and really shock when I found out that  I was pregnant. The economy is in the toilet and my boyfriend will be let go from work around December /09. The only jobs around here are about $8.00-$9.00 an hour. I'm also 35 which is consider kind of old and have already had some health concerns. My first child is 16 years old and won't be very close with this child. With all that I am excited about this baby and everything looks good. I have about 20 weeks to go. I can't wait to do it all over again. It will be strange at first, but a lot of fun.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Oh honey I was TERRIFIED! The economy is terrible, there are hiring freezes on everything, my work was slowing down, and I knew I wasn't spending my life with the father.<br>  <br>  I cried, and went to my mom. (Yes at 21 years old I still go to my mom. We have a GREAT relationship) anyway I'm now 37 weeks pregnant and put it God's hands. I know everything will be fine. l love my baby girl.<br>  <br>  You just take that test and tell someone you trust to help you threw it. The minute you see a positive your motherhood begins. Find insurance, a doctor, pre-natals, and start preparing. It will be okay.|`|QrZcKRsDaa	Yes I was scared. It's very normal. <br>  You just do whatever you have to do to make sure that baby has a good life. It's time to woman-up & make some decisions. Good luck to you!|`|UHTcpdkVaa	I'm still scared.  I'm also pretty sure now that's the normal mental state for any parent.
wiAVa1H5aa	Sounds like you were ovulating again or you didn't ovulate when you thought you did or you are just finishing ovulating.   Did you use your middle finger or index finger?   Your middle finger is (usually) longer and sometimes works better, and you don't need to really grasp the cervix the tip of a finger is enough to give you the information you need, like you observed your cervical os was slightly open, a sign of ovulation and/or your period coming.
kTu7UtS1aa	I also use the monitor and my peak days have varied.  I, too, have gotten a peak on day 10, day 14, and this past month is was day 16.  And I guess those days vary because my cycle varies as well.  My cycles have been 21 days - 23 days, but for the past couple of months my cycles have stayed close to 27 days. <br>  <br>  I really like the monitor; it helped me get pregnant after my first use.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|yp9rEMSraa	Im using the monitor this month also...It will show you your peak days...maybe you guys have been trying to conceive when you thought you were ovulating and actually were not TTC on your peak days....my cycle varies from month to month also so i never know exactly when i am ovulating...it helps to know when your peak days are....do the BD on the high and peak days but keep using the monitor when you return to the low days in case it goes back to high again (maybe a miss reading)...i have never heard of it going back high but just in case....if it is your first few months using it remember the monitor is still trying to figure out your body and what is normal for you....Good luck and baby dust your way|`|5axGfFofaa	Dec. High on day 12 peak day 14...POSITIVE pregnancy test on day 27....unfortunately had m/c on Jan 5th (we BD'd every high and peak day)<br>  I hit the button again on Jan 5th just to assess next cycle (not trying to get pregnant)<br>  Jan. high day 13 peak day 15 period day 30<br>  Feb high day 12...(just got peak today!!) day 16 on monitor...hopefully it will work it's magic again.  <br>  If you are "peak" on day 10 and not getting a period for 25-35 days later, you may have some sort of luteal phase defect.<br>  You should give it 3 months and if you find that continues to be the case, go see your doc so he can give you a med to regulate that.  You should get your period 14-18 days after ovulation (there is some variance on those #'s but 25 is excessive)<br>  The monitor is the greatest thing...all TTC's should have one!<br>  Best wishes and I hope the monitor "works" again for both of us!|`|oHNrktxTaa	I have on a 24-25 day menstrual cycle & my positive LH surge from using the OPK sticks was on day 11.<br>  <br>  I am now using the Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor & I am on day 9 & no 2nd or 3rd bars for peak days. So, I shall see if anything on day 10 or 11. <br>  <br>  But, it could very well be that ovulation may come earlier for you than you thought & mine could be later than I thought.<br>  <br>  BABY DUST to US!!!!!!!!!!!!
tQPvv0Glaa	Even if you conceived when you had sex 6 days ago, it is too early to have any real symptoms.  Most women don't feel any symptoms until around the time they would miss their period, which is also the same time that you would experience implantation bleeding.  You'll just have to wait another week or so (assuming you had sex around your ovulation time) and take a test.|`|bnQ7im8Caa	omg that's exactly how i feel!! and i haven't had implantation bleeding.. i think we might be pregnant!|`|0udjgaoBaa	you wouldn't feel results so soon....Wait until next month!|`|vigFmfLmaa	Most women don't feel or see any signs of implantation.  We need to know how many days past ovulation, not last sex, you are.  There are plenty of days you can have sex with pretty much no hope of conceiving.  Some women get symptoms, others don't, but most don't get them until further along, around 6-8 weeks.|`|imIiuaAAaa	Fatigue is an early sign of pregnancy, but it'd be a stretch if it was only six days ago. Wait until your period is supposed to come and test if it's a no-show. Good luck!|`|ouh5eXcmaa	YOUR PREGNANT!!!|`|WSXDQ4bpaa	I did not have any symptoms until I was 6 weeks pregnant and most other women generally start having morning sickness on the 6th week as well. I had sore breasts at 4 weeks pregnant, they were so sore and tingly and heavy feeling. I think it is far too early for you to be having any symptoms quite yet. I did not have any implantation bleeding until 4-5 weeks and it was only light brown colored. I did not experience fatigue until around 11 weeks or so. <br>  <br>  Even if you are pregnant, it is like I said still far too early to be having any symptoms yet.|`|d6r5hRjYaa	i never had implatation bleeding but my early symptoms were pms like symptoms but worse|`|8W8ORcp5aa	perhaps prego.. or just about to start your period GO GET a TEST

wWyChyYiaa	Ok...first...did you take ovulation tests so that you are sure that you ovulated?  If you did in fact ovulate, that does not necessarily mean that you conceived.  On the flip side, I have know women to be pregnant and not have it show up on anything but a blood test.<br>  <br>  You said that you are not stressed...but in all actuality you are a bit stressed.  If you are counting days and hoping that you are pregnant and taking tests....it is very stressful...more than you may realize.  The waiting and anticipation can play much more stress on your mind that you may realize.  <br>  <br>  When you go to your doctor next wednesday ask them to run a blood test...if they don't suggest it already and talk with them about different things you can do to make the process easier (because believe me it IS a process)<br>  <br>  It took me years to finally conceive...so don't be discouraged.  If you want a really good book to read, and get some answers, check out "Stirrups Aren't Just For Horses" by Janean Buyny.  This is a great, and easy read.  It talks about the easiest ways to conceive and talks about each process individually.  She talks like a real person and not a doctor.  It is very motivational and will make you understand alot of the things that go into having a child....without all the medical mess.  It has been very helpful to quite a few women that I know are trying to conceive.
WPI0Z47saa	I am pregnant with number 2 also. My son is 3. We were trying to have a baby so I was excited when I found out. Sometimes I find myself worrying though and I think it is natural. Alot of thngs race through your mind. Will I be able to handle this? Will my son be happy once the baby is here? Is this going to be too hard? Things like that. My parents swore that I would have a girl this time. They had their grandson and wanted a grandaughter. My husbands side has mostly boys too so everyone, including me, thought this would be a girl. I am 22 weeks pregnant with another boy and that is fine so you get what you get. And no matter how confused you feel, it will work out in the end because it has to. Good luck to you.

dFHsAXDMaa	Okay first of all as a nurse and a mother of 4 I want to say are you retarded to ask this question on line when you should be in car on way to pediatrician or calling 911. foaming mouth is usually cause by drug over dose or inhalants that are poisioning system. OMG Go to doctors already|`|T1f2UZHMaa	Yes, i think i know what you mean.  My toddler is doing the same, i think its just the saliva from the mouth, as they breath, the saliva forms bubbles and comes out from the mouth.  Just like when some people sleep, they may have some saliva come out from the mouth but instead for our toddlers, they are blowing it out hence making bubbles that look like foam.  Nothing to worry about perfectly normal.

There is an awareness of what people like and do not like. The typical three-year old wants to please and is highly susceptible to praise. Motor behavior is now sure. They enjoy gross motor activities with large objects. Block play usually includes much carrying and lifting, which is as important as the finished product they are building. Fine motor development has progressed to enable this age child to pick up small objects more easily. In writing with a crayon, the adult grasp is simulated. Movements are still awkward. Sometimes they will pick up the crayon with the nondominant hand and then transfer it to the dominant hand. <br>  Play now goes on with other children. Whereas at two they were involved in parallel play, they now begin to play cooperatively. Play is often structured by the children's imagination. <br>  Language has expanded and the three-year old now has the ability to have fun with language. They like to make up new words and enjoy silly rhyming. They like guessing games. The concept of space and the understanding of place words have developed so that the three-year old can respond to directions which include prepositions, such as "put the ball under the table." <br>  Three-year olds can be induced to respond by using words such as: help, needs, guess what and how about. They like the idea of a surprise and a secret.

8t8NjjnVaa	No, don't add cereal, he's far too young for that.  Cereal shouldn't be given until 6 months, 4 months at the absolute earliest.  And you never give it in a bottle, only by spoon.  But again, he's far too young for any cereal.<br>  <br>  The fact that when you pumped you didn't have much milk coming out doesn't mean anything.  The baby is much more efficient at getting milk out than any pump.  <br>  <br>  If you're having so many issues with the formula, that should be a cue to you to stop switching them and relactate.  It's healthier for him and you to breastfeed anyway.<br>  <br>  I know you're saying you're pretty dried up now, but your child is only three weeks old.  Relactating at this point shouldn't be too difficult or take very long.<br>  <br>  Just let the baby nurse on you as much as he will.  Then offer some formula if he wants it.  While he's eating the formula, pump.  You may not get much out and that's okay...it's not really about getting milk out, it's about stimulating your milk supply.  <br>  <br>  Whatever milk you do get out, even if it's just an ounce, store that in the fridge (it keeps for several days in the fridge).  At the next feeding, offer him the breast again, then whatever breastmilk you have in the refrigerator, and if he's still hungry, after that, give him some formula.  Meanwhile, pump again.  <br>  <br>  Pump with every feeding and you will begin to see him take less expressed breastmilk/formula.  When he begins to be content after just having the breast, you can stop the formula altogether.<br>  <br>  But like I said, what you get out when you pump does not tell you how much you are producing.  If your baby is wetting 5-6 or more diapers in a 24-period, then you're making enough breastmilk and he's getting enough.  And by wetting, I don't mean soaking them, I just mean that he's urinating at least 5-6 times in a 24-hour period.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Do not put cereal in his bottles ... if he's vomiting now, picture that coupled with cereal in his bottles. Plus it's a choking hazard. <br>  <br>  What were his previous problems? All vomiting? Perhaps he's allergic to milk proteins or soy. There are still milk proteins in formula that babies can be sensitive to. Or he could have reflux. Otherwise if he's just constipated or straining that might be somewhat normal - they often go several days without a poop and are just fine. You'll have to elaborate on what his other symptoms were with the other formulas. <br>  <br>  You could still try nursing him ... but pumping is not going to give you a good representation of how much milk you produce. It's not the same thing as a baby nursing. I bet you still have some milk if you tried - there are things you can do to boost your supply. If you keep nursing, you'll produce more breastmilk. <br>  <br>  But that's up to you. Just a suggestion.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You definitely don't want to be putting cereal in his bottle.  If he has a sensitive tummy or is prone to allergy, that's about the worst thing you can do. (Besides all the other risks associated with putting cereal in the bottle, like choking and malnutrition.) <br>  <br>  You need to speak with your doctor.  If baby has significant allergies (both cows milk and soy are common allergins) he may need a hypoallergenic formula (if he really needs it, your doc can write a prescription and WIC should provide it), or, if it's possible for you, you can consider relactating and breastfeeding. Babies are never allergic to breastmilk though, if he has significant allergies, you might have to limit your own diet to avoid exposure to the allergins.|`|4yGGjs7zaa	if he is only 3 weeks old and is having trouble with formula is your not giving his body a chance to get used to one type! you've changed it 4 times in 3 weeks! your probably causing this as his boody is not getting used to digesting one type of milk instead your changing it! if he isnt allergic to the others then soy isnt nesecary! choose one and stick it out for a while otherwise you are going to cause some damage to him digestive system!|`|7ff66488372ffac33ad0d62a762a8c6eaa	First off, please stop switching formulas so much.

It is because the "spinkter" doesn't always dump the stomach content into the small intestine and some baby do need medicine to Relax the muscle and you have to remember that it is only a max of 2 inches to throw it up. I did switch to simulac sensitive, the orange one. You have to have them on the new formula for a bit to even know if it works. Please don't switch so much, that can cause throwing up as well. You baby will out grow this stage once that muscle starts to work right. My doctor said to cut down feeding and feed more often so that she is only taking a max of an ounce but feed her often. OR it COULD be acid reflux, newborns can't speak up so just hang in there. They are learning how to use their new body. Hard work!|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	NO, don't give him cereal, that will only upset his stomach more. You should try a hypoallergenic formula like Nutramagin almost all babies will tolerate that. In the meantime, if you aren't taking any medications, see if you can express some breastmilk and give him that in a bottle. You will need a doctor's note for WIC to provide the Hypoallergenic formula, but you should go buy a can for yourself right now and then call the doctor once you've figured out that it works. Good luck and I hope your baby feels better|`|7N4AtRogaa	If you put cereal in his bottles, it will make him full faster, but not in a good way.  Being so young, he needs all the nutrition he can get, and if you fill him up on cereal, he will be lacking nutritionally and may become malnourished.  Keep working with the doctors to find out what works, and always remember that the option to breast feed is there and 3 weeks is not to late to reestablish a good supply.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	what other formulas have u tried? try the concentrated formula. my son didnt do so well on the powder and no problems on the concentrated. <br>  btw: how can she try breastmilk at 3 weeks. get a clue|`|pCZPtegeaa	My daughter did the same thing at 6 weeks when we started her on formula.

Male circumcision is genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  Genital mutilation is genital mutilation, regardless of the victim's sex.<br>  <br>  Doing this to helpless infants who can't defend themselves against having the most sensitive part of the male anatomy is just wrong, cruel, barbaric and an atrocity.<br>  <br>  As a helpless infant, I was tied down, assaulted, sexually molested and mutilated by the process called circumcision.       This destroyed more than the usual 50-75% of sexual sensitivity in my case, making it impossible for me to achieve orgasm in normal sex.<br>  <br>  I finally found out about foreskin restoration after years of failed attempts.      Circumcision ruined my sex life.<br>  <br>  Don't let it ruin your sons.<br>  <br>  It isn't cleaner, it doesn't prevent disease, and in fact increases the susceptibility of males to HIV and other diseases.      The foreskin contains Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.<br>  <br>  The statistics show that the US, with its high rate of circumcision, has the highest rate of HIV transmission, much higher than the countries in Europe, South America, Scandinavia and Asia that don't mutilate male infants.<br>  <br>  Doctors do not disclose, and in fact suppress the adverse effects and complications resulting from male genital mutilation, as they make money from it, and are very frequently members of the religions that try to mutilate all males.     They are biased.<br>  <br>  Obviously, anyone with intelligence can understand that a natural and normal penis, with a foreskin, the way that nature intended, feels and functions better than one that's been made partial, mutilated and scarred by circumcision.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|7kosr9mcaa	If I could give Nurse Autumn a million thumbs up I so would!<br>  <br>  I completely agree with every single word she just wrote!|`|q1YDp1y3aa	He may or may not get a shot. You need to insist on this if you go through with a circumcision. Many doctors will not offer any pain relief. Some will offer sugar water or a numbing cream- neither of these works! Insist on a "penile ring block". If they refuse, walk out. <br>  <br>  He will be in pain. Imagine someone cutting off a piece of your labia- of course it will hurt! He will probably hurt more after urinating, but there will be some pain present all the time for at least the first few days. <br>  <br>  Its hard to say if he will cry or not. Many babies do, because of the pain. Some go into a type of shock instead, and then they appear to be sleeping. <br>  <br>  Clean it with water only. Wipes and soap will sting. They actually have to rip the foreskin away from the head, as its attached at this age. this means the whole head will be raw, not just the incision line. You may also need some vaseline, depending on the method your doctor uses. Be sure to ask about this before going home.<br>  <br>  Here is some more info on circ that you may not be aware of-<br>  <br>  The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with.

It is a shot that numbs the penis and has been shown to be the most effective pain management for circumcision.  Its *not* routine for many doctors to numb the penis so be sure to ask.

Make sure you understand when you should start retracting the remaining foreskin, as well as how to do it.  If you do not properly retract the remaining skin it can form scarring and penile adhesions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complication..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/complication...</a><br>  A penile or prepuce adhesion can occur after a circumcision if the remaining skin is not retracted after the circumcision has healed. When a circumcision is done, tissue which would normally be intact is split. Unless proper care is taken, the epithelium of the inner prepuce at the point where the foreskin was removed can reattach to the epithelium of the glans. The result of this is a penile adhesion. Usually the adhesions can be released by simple retraction. Sometimes, however, the fusion is so complete that simple retraction will not work, and the child must be referred to a urologist. Another problem is that smegma or bacteria can collect under the adhesion if it covers the preputial cavity and cause infection. Professionals must look for this problem, and parents must be taught how to care for the normal circumcised penis so that penile adhesions do not develop. This article discusses the formation and identification of penile adhesions, the process by which adhesions can be released, when a referral to a urologist is necessary and the proper care for the circumcised penis.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  To prevent the occurrence of penile adhesions, nurses and parents must be shown the proper technique of caring for the penis following a circumcision. Most nursing textbooks discuss the procedure and the initial care following a circumcision, which involves observation for bleeding and the application of Vaseline gauze or a lubricant and sterile gauze for 24 to 48 hours but do not discuss later retraction of the shaft skin.9-13 but usually this is all that they are taught. The penis looks different immediately following a circumcision than it does a few days later (at which time most babies are home from the hospital). With the swelling that occurs after a circumcision, the natural appearance of the shaft skin cannot be appreciated. The skin must heal after the circumcision and should not be retracted for approximately 10 to 14 days. However, the mother and the father must learn to pull back the shaft skin every day after the circumcision is healed so that the corona is free from any adherent skin. Another reason to retract the skin is to clean around the base of the glans, being certain to remove smegma and any other debris. Then the shaft skin should be returned to its original position, or a paraphimosis (constriction of the penis by the shaft skin) could occur.<br>  <br>  The technique of retraction can be taught to the parents while they are in the hospital. When the shaft skin is fully retracted, the glans should look like the top of a mushroom, with the corona and preputial cavity plainly visible. Oftentimes the edge of the corona has a purplish hue, and the parents can be told to look for this. Even though they cannot practice on their own child immediately following a circumcision, parents can practice the technique by any means the nurse finds helpful. One way might be to use two finger cots, one with the bottom removed and placed low on the finger, and the other rolled up and placed on the tip of that same finger. The lower cot can represent the shaft skin and the top can represent the glans and the corona. (To the authors knowledge, a practical model is not available.)<br>  <br>  The author conducted an informal survey in her clinical practice to discover the incidence of penile adhesions. Of the 150 males seen over the past year at their first visit (to the author), 23 or 15 percent, of the circumcised males had penile adhesions and 5, or three percent, had to have surgical correction. Since on statistics could be found in the literature on the occurrence of penile adhesions in the United States, there is no way to tell how this compares to national norm<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pediatrics.about.com/od/weeklyque..." rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.about.com/od/weeklyque...</a><br>  Treatment for Penile Adhesions<br>  If a child's penile adhesions don't go away on their own or if a parent wants to treat a child with extensive adhesions, one study recently has shown that applying a prescription steroid cream to the area three times a day for three weeks resulted in clearing the adhesions in almost 80 percent of infants. This makes sense when you consider that uncircumcised children that have a phimosis, in which their foreskin doesn't retract, are often successfully treated with topical steroid creams.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/newborn/nc..." rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/newborn/nc...</a><br>  I have a ten month old son who was ci|`|dOpKsNYcaa	You know you don't have to do that right.

Circumcision does hurt infants (a lot) whether they have anesthesia or not (and usually they don't even get it) and it's completely unnecessary. Contrary to popular belief, it's actually a lot easier to take care of them when they are not circumcised.

If it is a gomco circ, then you will have to put vassaline gauze on the wound, push back remaining skin to prevent adheasions, wash with water, put vassaline in the diaper to keep it form sticking, and if it is a plastibell circ, you need to wipe any feces fro the wound, and apply vassaline to keep it from sticking. <br>  <br>  (if you keep your son intact, you simply wash it like a finger until the foreskin retracts by itself, sometime before puberty)<br>  <br>  Have you considered leaving him intact?<br>  <br>  I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the enis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America (I don't know where you are?) So the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis....<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Your son can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...|`|xCoUvU8Laa	I am totally feeling Granola's answer...My son is not circumsized. There is no medical reason why or why not to get it done. Everyone just automatically gets it done because everyone else does! They started circumsizing during the vietnam war b/c soliders were getting infections from being "permiscuous" with the vietnamenese women. My husband is not circumsized either. I vote for no!!
B7iSU8UYaa	Breast size and fullness can vary all during pregnancy. Your breasts are preparing to make milk and adjusting to the new fluid levels in your system. It does not relate to miscarriage. Good luck!|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Symptoms vary all the time.

I also had other signs of miscarriage. For me it was also total loss of pregnancy symptoms, lower bak and shoulder pain, spotting with passing of small clots. <br>  <br>  good luck!!!!!

Take a moment to ask questions of someone who has been there.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have the baby and give him/her up for adoption. A baby has a heart beat after 22 days can fee, suck its thumb, has nail, hair, organs are functing, so is the brain.<br>  <br>  <br>  they will either insert a suction tube into the womb and suck the baby's body apart into a jar and then the skull will be left, they then crush the skull so it will fit through the suction tube or they will use a knife and cut the babys limbs and then suck them out through the suction tube and agan they crush the remaining skull so it will fit, the nurse will then reasemble the body parts to make sure they did not miss anything<br>  <br>  <br>  your 13 and if your not ready for a baby then keep your knees shut, honestly that is a bit slutty to be spreding um for a guy when your bearly a teenager, your still a little kid|`|bnQ7im8Caa	either way ur parents are going to find out, because if you get an abortion you need ur parents there...|`|WpH9zProaa	The best thing you can do is to tell your Mom. Even though she may be mad at first she is the best person to help you through this. Don't listen to what others are saying everyone makes mistakes and this will just be a mistake you had to make and you will figure out what is best for you. Half of the others on here are hypocrites. How old were they when they lost there virginity? Even though you are very young and should wait to have sex until you are mature enough to handle it and any of the consequences that can happen. The past is the past and now you have to deal with the present, you can't reverse time. <br>  <br>  Just make sure what ever you do you do it safely. You may even want to consider adoption (if you decide to have the baby). There are a lot of people out there who could provide a baby with a loving home that can't have there own.<br>  <br>  You should tell your Mom.<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|RV3oeESvaa	im sorry hun<br>  but either way u need to let your mom know because u r underage.<br>  your parents or someoone older needs to sign for u to get an abortion! maybe think about adoption!<br>  <br>  <br>  i know you are young but abortion isnt the way out...you'll might regret it later on!<br>  <br>  wish you luck on anything u do:)|`|RzYePezkaa	Don't do anything you do not want to do talk it over with your mother she may be mad at first but she will come around.But you must tell her before you get too far along and she notices.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I'm sorry if I sound rude but, if you would have kept your legs closed.. you wouldn't of had this problem.

Your her little girl and you're pregnant. That's hard to have to hear. But you need some reasonable adult support right now. Abortion isn't your only option. You can give it up for adoption or even keep it. You really need to talk to your mother and come up with a plan.

It makes me ashamed to be a human being. Right now you need your mother like never before. If you can't tell her, get a teacher or a friend to do it. She will be mad as hell, and she has every right to be, but then she will be the biggest tower of strength and support that you can imagine. That's what us mothers do. I was 15 when i got pregnant, and my mum went crazy at first. But, then she was there by my side every step of the way. My daughter is almost 12 now, and i don't regret any of my decisions. I have 3 beautiful children and an amazingly close relationship with my mum. I'm not going to sugar coat it for you, being a teen mum is hard work. You will miss out on some crucial adolescent experiences with your friends, you'll feel isolated from your peers, and you will be judged (pretty much like you have been here), but you know what, there are positives too. I am young enough to relate to my daughter in a way that gives us a very special relationship, and when all my children have grown up and have their own lives, i'll still only be in my 30s. So, i just get to do my growing up the other way around. It's hard sweetie, but it isn't impossible. And, if you opt for a termination, that is your choice also, but you will still need your mum for support as it isn't an easy decision to make or live with. Please don't feel like this is the end of the world, worse things happen, and people make mistakes. We've all done silly things, don't punish yourself now, just confide in someone and start trying to make sense of the situation you are in. My thoughts are with you sweetie, and i wish you lots of luck. Have the courage to face this decision now, with the help of your mum.|`|hikDP6E7aa	u ***** u said u wuz 10 on the other one u is a ****** liar dumb *** stop wastin ppls time jus cuz u dont have a life u makin me pissed hoe so stop lying *****!!!!!!|`|euN3ct9oaa	I can understand your fears. 13 is very young to raise a child. I actually know a couple that had sex at 13 and got pregnant, they are now in their 30's and did fine, with their parent's help of course. Just keep in mind that this is your body, and you can do whatever it is that you want to do with it. If you don't want to have an abortion- then don't. Don't do it just because your boyfriend wants you to. There is always the option of adoption. That way, you know that your baby will have a great life because they won't give a child to someone who can't care for it. If you do want full responsibility of raising your baby, you need to talk to your mom. I know it's scary and she'll be mad for a long time, but once your baby is born, she will be in heaven. Lol all parents are. She will realize that there's nothing you can do to take it back. Also, learn from your mistakes. I wish you luck and hope that your decisions will be for the best.|`|fLU63N4kaa	Tell your mom.|`|7minC5Evaa	How long did u plan this lie?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If this is true WTF ARE YOU THINKING!!!!!!!!!!! a 13 YEAR OLD!!!!! if i was you're dad...|`|Di7KqbVQaa	Well we cant make the decision for you. Should have kept your legs closed.|`|YcuZRv6Faa	Honestly, I'm not saying you shouldn't have sex because of your age, and I know you didn't ask for criticism, but I am trying to give you some helpful advice. I believe that sex is only around for the human race to replenish itself, and so that married couples can be closer with each other. So you really shouldn't be having sex if you didn't want a baby, and since you're not married. The reason I say you should be married before you have sex is because then you will be in a stable relationship where you will be better able to care for a child and less likely to catch diseases and what not. <br>  I know it's too late for all of that, but it is not too late for you to choose not to become a murderer. It doesn't matter what anybody says, abortion is murder, you are ending the developing LIFE of a fetus. Consider adoption, like everyone has been telling you, there are so many people out there with good homes, who would love to take care of your baby. Yes, you will have to deal with being pregnant, and everything else but those are the consequences of having sex. Don't punish the little baby because of your own carelessness. This is one of your life lessons, deal with it and move on. <br>  And yes, do tell your mom as soon as possible. If she won't help you, there are other services that will. It is not the end of the world though it may seem like it to you at the moment.<br>  God bless you. and I hope you make the right decision. I understand how scared and confused you are, and I'm sorry you weren't better educated by your parents and teachers on the issue... If you were and just didn't listen, I'm sorry you chose to be ignorant.<br>  Your boyfriend should have thought of the possible consequences before he had sex with you... It's too bad what he wants you to do because it is not his choice. By the way.. if you decide to have sex anyway after this.. and you still don't want children, there are condoms, and birth control. Lots of preventative actions.|`|f1SWISQYaa	your screwed|`|SihmWU0Baa	personally i think abortion is murder but the best thing you can do is talk to your mom and its your choice not your boyfriends... you can always adopt it and that would be better<br>  <br>  that way your giving it a chance to live and strive but an abortion you are cutting its life short <br>  <br>  i am 16 and pregnant and im keeping my baby but a few of my friends have had kids and they have found great couples to adopt them and they are now striving and starting to grow up and hvae a chance at living a good life|`|MFI0V2GBaa	You're 13 years old, no place is going to let you get an abortion by yourself. Tell your mom, talk to her about it. Don't let you're 'boyfriend' tell you what to do, because of course he's not going to want the kid at this age.<br>  <br>  This should keep you thinking twice about doing something like that at your age. It's discusting.<br>  <br>  Just do the right thing, and go to your mom.

And secondly, you DO need to tell your mom so she can help you because obviously you're too immature to make wise decisions for yourself.

2d8879147618190440919438922e8a7eaa	i thought the same about my son.  he displayed several symptoms of being autistic.  not until he was 2 did he try to talk.  one thing i have learned is that every state has an early childhood intervention program named differently for each state.  you can ask your doctor for the number.  it is a free program for children under 5.  someone will come to your home, and ask you a bunch of questions relating to development.  emotional, communication, i think there are 5 categories.  each answer you give about your child ranges on a points system.  if your child has so many points, they will offer you therapy in any and all needed areas.  my son had emotional and speech therapy as well as occupational.  they will come to your home once a week or bi monthly, maybe even twice a week if you and the therapists feel it is needed.  My son made a drastic improvement.  it is hard to think of how he was and now is.  sometimes, kids just need a little extra help and others there is a medical reason for their actions.  i advise you to speak with your doctor about this program.  you don't need a doctor's request to use this program, so you can try and find the number yourself too, but the doctor will know what you are talking about.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	As a nurse and a mother of 4 kids myself I would say there is need for concern. Contact pediatrician make an apointment and talk to them about same things you said here there is testing they can do to determine if she has autism and and the earlier it is diagnosed and treated the more successful the child is in school and later in life. Autism varies in degree and she could be helped very easily|`|ZDqG0CzWaa	i dont think she has autism because autism is a  social problem. If she was autistic she wouldnt be affectionate as autistic children dont like giving hugs. Also autistic children dont pretend play. My daughter doesnt always respond to her name but i dont think she is autistic she is just ignoring me as she is more interested in something else; I think its just a case of her being 2. Just because she is late in doing things doesnt make her autistic babies develop at different stages. my daughter walked at 16.5 months and is 2 in april and can probably say about 30 words but she doesnt use these words all the time she probably uses about 10 of them and the rest she just repeats when we say them. I dont think there is anything wrong with her and i dont think there is anything wrong with your daughter either.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	That doesn't sound like autism to me. It sounds like she may just be a little behind in her speech & social development. From what I've read, autistic children don't make eye to eye contact with people, they don't smile or laugh or give other kids hugs & kisses or pretend play with toys. Your daughter is fine. Do you read to her much? That helps with language development. Try and have her around other kids so she can interact more.

I do however want to correct anothers persons comment on our headaches aren't normal unless there is something wrong.  That is completely NOT true.  I went to the Dr for my headaches and they said it WAS completely normal.  Because of all the hormone changes while your pregnant women who usually don't have headaches get them all the time.  So don't worry you are FINE.  And drinking water really helped me.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	first off it is uncommon to get headaches during pregnancy unless there is something wrong so i think u should see your doctor (don't worry, i could be wrong). but in the meantime you can only take one paracetamol every 4-6 hours...but don't take them frequently.

93Pmc3N1aa	Oh my hun.. I'm sorry. It does sound like your daughter was melested.. Because 4 year olds don't know what sex is. I was still asking how babies were made until I was 8. And by saying her and her uncle played that game... Most predators... call it a "game" so it doesnt intimidate the child. Your daughter is definetly showing the signs of a sexually abused child. I was abused by my stepfather, and i acted the same way. Ask your daughter about it more... How did they play the game.. Get it on tape.. (audio or video) as evidence, please take this into court. That sick ******* needs to be locked up. Who knows? He may be doing this to other children too, and you might be the only one who can stop this (as classical as that sounds) You need to call the police, and say you have a suspision that your daughter was melested, and that you'd like a restraining order in the meen time. I'm really sorry to hear, but its good your not trying to cover it up.. Just remember through this whole process, your daughter did nothing wrong, she thought it was a game.|`|VHHis05Naa	Get a child psychologist to evaluate her right away and take her to the doctor to get checked out.

Get that bastard thrown in jail.|`|Ga5Wcaj5aa	My niece is five and she was molested by her cousin.She was sleeping over at my house(She calls me sister) we were laying in my bed talking about life and i was telling what i wanted to do when i got older.She told she wanted to live me and then she said the strangest thing,"Sissy,I want to have sex with you when i got older and with meme and paw paw and tate "She even told she wanted to have sex with her mommy and daddy.I told her that that's not right and she got into details about what she wanted us to do.Heaven knows a girl that young shouldn't be able to explain in detail how a girl has oral sex with a man.So I talked to my brother about it and he said we should tell mom so he told mom and i told my sister about what her daughter said.She wouldn't tell her mom what she told me,but finally her mom told her it's ok to tell someone and she finally told her it was her cousin.It was really hard for me to see my niece go through that.The way she was talking its hard for not to imagine her being a bisexual slut when she gets older.I know how you feel,but at least she's getting help.My sister doesnt want to turn my niece's nephew in,so she could be mentally disturbed for the rest of her life,but if you stop it in time everything will turn out ...ok.Maybe not as good as before and maybe she'll have an attitude problem,but know this.It was never your fault.You didn't know it would happen and you couldn't stop it,but i know fom experience that when it comes down to it.A mother is all you have and maybe someday she'll realize that.^^|`|Yl3C9svGaa	I am so sorry you have to go through this. You are doing great by going to a counselor. The only advice I have to give comes from a mother who was in a similar situation. Her daughter, now a teenager, was molested from ages 4-8 by a family member. She says she takes things one day at a time, and truely believes that she and her daughter can overcome anything. She handles things one situation at a time, seeking outside help when needed.  Just be there for your daughter, be open and honest, and most of all supportive in any way necessary.

Ka52nbhNaa	From my personal experience, going through infertility treatments made me feel like a failure . . . like my body could not do something so natural, so beautiful as conceive a child.  It can be awkward to talk about . . . people also give you the "pitying" looks sometimes when you explain that you have struggled to conceive.<br>  <br>  I have twins from IVF - I have encountered many people who ask if twins run in our families not people who ask if we had fertility treatments . . . if it is someone that I am really not friends with, I will usually just say "sort of, there are twins in the family (both of our sides have twins) but not that close" or if it is someone that I know better . . . . I will usually just smile and say that we "had a bit of help from science".  Sometimes I feel like it is not their business and would rather not have a long conversation about it.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Maybe she just doesn't like the personal questions about her medical information.  The treatments might have been painful or just emotionally difficult for her.  But saying that twins run in her family then she doesn't have to talk about it.<br>  <br>  My sister in law had many fertility treatments (what exactly I don't know)  before she got pregnant.  I never spoke about it to her personally, but I don't think she was ashamed about it, but I do think it was very emotionally and physically trying on her.  So I just respected her privacy|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Some people are very private about such things. It's their prerogative to keep their treatment to themselves if they wish. I personally was very open about undergoing treatment, but I am generally an open person. And there is a chance that she became pregnant with twins naturally- whether it's in her family or not, it is possible. Don't worry about it, be happy for her.|`|ZckxI1M5aa	Women tend to be ashamed that they are unable to conceive naturally. I myself refused to tell people, only my very close friends a few of my family members knew.<br>  <br>  I guess I felt ashamed that I was infertile. I felt like I was less than a woman. I mean this is a major part of the womans function and I felt dysfunctional.  I felt like I was broken. <br>  <br>  But after prayer and counseling and understanding that I am really not alone in this, I am able to talk about it more openly. <br>  <br>  I'm sure alot of women feel this way.|`|Wzws8v8daa	becaues some people make negative comments about women and men who cannot get pregnant, they act like something is wrong with them.  so many women decide to keep it private so that nobody will talk about them behind their back like that.|`|ITfBQzg6aa	I really don think its any of your Business if she did or dint.. <br>  Who are you to care..|`|c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	Well, I guess for some it is like asking if they had a nose job. Not really a polite question right? It's kind of funny though that your friend would admit to you that she is having difficulty conceiving and then not want to admit using assisted reproductive technology (ART). I have gone through fertility treatments and not at all shy about it. But if I were to have multiples and someone unfamiliar to me asked if they were natural I may feel a little uncomfortable. And, I did for awhile feel less of a women because of my infertility. It hurts. <br>  <br>  Lots of celebrities have gone through ART and don't claim to. For me I think it would be great to get the world to see that infertility is an issue by having some of them "come out". It is unfortunate but cases like Optimoms has given ART a bad rap, especially IVF. She made a bad choice and had a horrible doctor who needs to have his license revoked. But, with Octomom and all of the media hype, those who are going through or have gone through ART are being looked down upon. I know someone who has triplets. She used to get people smiling and talking to her and her children but now she just gets dirty looks. The goal of ART is to have one baby, NOT multiples but it rare cases it happens. Unfortunately with the media the world is not seeing that. Infertile women are sometimes seen as selfish. It is a sensitive subject to us, especially now.<br>  <br>  Just accept your friend, try and understand that it can be a sensitive subject, and adore her children.|`|SHBpzAIZaa	"I actually feel bad for people who do have twins naturally because everyone will assume it is fertility treatments and that the person won't talk about it."<br>  <br>  WTF? What in the world is wrong with fertility treatments if you are unable to become pregnant on your own?<br>  <br>  Not all women are able to concieve naturally, and alot more women than you probably think, need help when ttc.<br>  <br>  For you to say that you feel bad for people who have twins, because everyone will assume whatever, is a really harsh statement. As a woman that has been ttc for over 3 years now, I wouldnt care what ANYBODY assumed... if I could have twins. I am not selfish though and I would be happy with just one baby. <br>  <br>  Maybe your friend thinks that her medical issues are none of your business. Maybe she thinks that when it comes to things like this you are shallow and would judge her or "feel bad" for her. <br>  <br>  Bottom line... Mind your business!|`|wWyChyYiaa	Some women feel  that they are "less of a woman" if they can't conceive.  I would guess that there are many people that want support from others so they will talk about it.  When I was going through my years of fertility treatments, it wasn't that I was ashamed, it was the fact that I would get extremely emotional when someone would ask.  It is such a draining process, and it can literally beat you down each month.  I think that it is easier to talk about once the process is over and you may have had your child.<br>  <br>  It is becoming more open on television and radio now.  People are looking to them for support and there are some really great books on the market channeling alot of what these women are feeling.  One really great book is entitled "Stirrups Aren't Just For Horses" by Janean Buyny.  It is excellent.  It talks about a woman who went through 12 years of issues with fertility and she tells women about each step of the process.  She talks about how they may feel, if they may gain weight on certain drugs, and the overall experience.  It is very real, and it is so easy to understand.  It also has put the topic out there for women and men to understand.  I applaud women who talk about their issues to help others gain control of their lives and give them empowerment.<br>  <br>  As for what people say and why they hide it....look that all the backlash of the "octo-mom".  She has created more than a stir in the world of fertility.  That...and all the criticism would be enough for anyone to want to keep their business to themselves.
tQPvv0Glaa	It's normal to have irregular periods for a while after giving birth.  Your hormones are out of whack and it takes a while for your system to re-regulate.  What you had on February 7 may have been your first real period after having the baby.  And the bleeding you had today could be the start of another period, or it could just be some break-through bleeding.  I doubt you got pregnant if you used protection.  As long as you are not having very severe heavy bleeding, or bleeding accompanied by pain, I'm sure you are fine and there is no reason to call the doctor.  Like I said, irregular bleeding is very normal after having a baby.  <br>  <br>  P.S. - Congrats on the new baby!|`|sAbah6dTaa	when i had my c-section i bleed for 6 weeks straight, i would say from it but you probably better call the doctor just in case.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	You might have an infection seeing as you weren't very smart and had sex before your cervix was closed. Make an appointment with a doctor to be sure.|`|TJezsCkHaa	Call the doctor and see him better and safer for you.Especially you had c-section.|`|oojO4WAraa	It's probably okay.  As long as you don't start seeing large amounts of bright red blood you are okay.  Sex just kind of made that blood work it's way out of you.  I wouldn't worry.  Call the doctor if this persists or you start bleeding bright red.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	it's just your body recovering... no need to be alarmed. if there is pain, burning, itchiness or a weird smell you might want to contact the doctor. otherwise, just drink lots of water or 100% cranberry juice to flush yourself out. you will probably bleed for several weeks on and off as you have had major surgery and delivered a baby. if the bleeding is painful, bright red, contains large clots or is accompanied by a fever, see the doc immediately. take care of yourself and your bub--good luck!!!
NbJbZXtGaa	I think $5 is good. I know most babysitters in my area charge $10, but I would NEVER pay that much...that is highway robbery! Although, I am spoiled and my SIL does it for free.|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	10 dollars an hour in LA is probably pretty good, especially since it's a wealthier neighborhood.  I wouldn't go too much higher than that though, since there are only two kids.  Here in Illinois, I got that much when I babysat for one family who had four kids, but I got that no matter how many of them I watched.  They were nice, but are grown up now.|`|nKEKG0Cqaa	i always tell parents i start at $10 an hour for one child and that they can pay me whatever.  then i usually get at least $10 an hour.  most babysitters charge $10.  especially in LA you should probably consider bumping your prices up.|`|XDajZzBoaa	It seems to me like it is too little, but I am no expert, so the best thing to do would be to go on the internet and look up how much other babysitters your age are charging. It also depends on your experience.
sxecXFgraa	I'm Catholic and I teach my kids (10 and 7) what I believe.  I also tell them that the bible was spoken for a long time before it was actually wrote so some of the things may not be completely accurate.  (They've played the telephone game in school so they know how things change over time).  If my kids grow up to believe something different, I'm OK with that.  I was raised Baptist and converted to Catholic when I got married.  I don't really think I would ever stop having religious conversations with my kids, I still have them with my mom.|`|im3vWyv6aa	I'm going to start out by saying we are Baptist. We go to church regularly and we are raising our children to be Baptist... we are a family... we attend together. I guess I don't expect one of my children  to say they want to be anything different... this is all they know and understand. They know there are other religions... but this Baptist Church down the road is "our Church".<br>  <br>  Now, I can see after a child (not really a child anymore)... leaves home and starts hanging with other friends, or marries someone with a different religious background and visits various Churches wherever he/she may live... making a different choice. I will accept whatever choice they make.<br>  <br>  I was raised Catholic... now I'm Baptist. My Mom & Dad accept my choice.<br>  <br>  NOTE: This is my opinion and this is how I see my children dealing with Religious choice. <br>  <br>  :0)|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I think a child can make an intelligent decision about religion between 9 and 13 years old. I was about 9 when I started questioning my parent's religion and 13 when I started on the path that lead me to being a witch. I plan to tell my son about what I believe and let him know that it's very personal and what's right for me is not right for everyone. I will teach him that my spiritual beliefs affect how I look at and treat the whole world. I would hope that whatever path he chooses he will retain the compassion and appreciation for beauty that I show him. I will stop talking about religion whenever he asks me to or tells me he isn't interested anymore. Ideally we will always be able to have an open dialogue about anything and religion is just one more thing to help him discover himself and his "place in the world." I hope for him to have a deep sense of spirituality and appreciation for this world and everything that lives in it, however he gets there is alright by me as long as gets there.|`|AA11210211	I think it depends on the child,when my children are old enough to ask me what's this about,what's that about is when I think they are old enough which would probably be somewhere around 6-10 yrs I am guessing.I think I convey my lack of believe in more of a matter of opinion because it is my opinion and even though my opinion can be proven I still convey it as an opinion.I will not tell them I am wrong because this is what I believe and what I believe I believe so why would I tell them I am wrong,that would be contradicting myself.When my children are no longer interested in religion then I will let it be no matter what their age is.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Okay.  My answer is long and since you have touched on many areas, I will try to get my thoughts all together and make some sense.<br>  We are very serious about our relgious beliefs.  We attend our church several times a week, we are involved in many extra activites pertaining to our beliefs and we are affiliated with many things that also believe what we do.  One example of this is that our chidlren go to a Christian school (the younger ones) that teach what we believe. We surround our children with what we believe to be true.....from a VERY young age...birth.  <br>  Our children have grown up(and are still growing up) hearing the thruths we believe.  Do we tell them in such a way that would convey it to simply be our opinion?  Not at all because we don't feel like it is our opinion.  It is what we absolutly believe to be true.  We tell our children what we believe as if we were telling them that the earth is round.  But the same way we tell them the earth is round and people used to believe that the erath was flat, we also tell them that not everyone believes what we believe.  According to their age (and my children are pretty well all over the age spectrum), we tell them what the other beliefs are.  <br>  Our youngest children know that some people believe that we evolved from monkeys.  They also know that WE believe what the Bilbe teaches about creation.  Our oldest children know that there are MANY different beliefs in this world, and they are encouraged to make their own choice.  In fact, we don't want our children to follow blindly in our "practices".  We want them to accept he Bible truth on their own. <br>  We believe that the Bible teaches that if one does not accept Jesus Christ as his/her personal savior and admit that without him, he/she willl go to hell after death.  Since our very soul's eternity is resting on whether or not we believe, we want our children to accept it for themselves FOR REAL.  Blindly obeying and following isn't enough.  It has to be their belief too or it isn't true slavation. <br>  So no, we dont tell them as a matter of opinion, but we do want them to come to it on thier own.  For this to happen, it has to be REAL to them.  We dont just say one thing and live another way.  Our children do not see us act one way at church and in front of people, but a different way at home.  They see that it is real to us.  We aren't just pretendng or "playing church".  We are real and they see it.  They know that this thing called religion can be real to some and an act to others, and they have to decide fo themselves whether or not it is real to them.<br>  You are right that at first children are just doing what thier parents do.  They don't know any different at first.  But as they grow and get older they are able to see for themselves if they want what we have or not.  My three oldest children have claimed Jesus on their own without persuasion from us.  In fact, whe our nine year old recently asked about it, I did all I could NOT to influence him because, again, we want it to be real...not mama induced.<br>  Our two youngest children are also becoming interested, but it's our experience that at 4 and 5, it is normal to be curious about something they hear about all the time. but it dosn't necessarily mean they are mentaly able and ready to and capable of understanding.  Some are, but not usually so young.<br>  If my chidlren were not interested in having conversations pertaining to our beliefs, I would probably never stop trying to get them to see the 'truth'.  According to what we believe, the price is just to high.  I would, however, be respectful and considerate about it.  I know some adults who have turned their children away forever because of thier judgmental, condecending aditudes.  Who would want that?  If someone who was very hateful, mean, holier -than- thou and self righteous kept badgering me about 'getting' right with God', I wouldn't wnat it.   I,  myself would be more inclined ot listen to somene who could present their views intellegently, kindly and without judgment.  I woudl be that way with my own children, too.<br>  As you can see, our religious beliefs are not just a passing 'opinion'.  they are truly who we are.  They define us.  It is so much a fact in our lives that to play it down to the people we love the most on this earth (our children) would be tantamount to losing one of them to death.|`|s6emVQleaa	I think kids are pretty aware of their religion at a young age.  I honestly feel that my husband and I have a responsibility to raise our daughter in the beliefs that we have.  For us that means we go to church, we pray with her, we do devotions as a family, and we talk about God.  I can't ultimately make her believe it, and she will have to decide what to do with it at some point.  I would say until she moves out of my house, she will be expected to go to church and participate.  I'm sure we will talk about other beliefs, but I wouldn't believe it myself if I thought I was wrong.  If she chooses not to believe, I won't ever stop praying for her and I won't stop talking to her about it.  I know people don't like talking or thinking about heaven and hell (or believe in it for that matter), but think of it this way Des.  If you truly believed that by not believing in God that your children would go to hell (and I do), how could I ever rest in making sure it didn't happen.  I have no problem with what other people believe, but I will do whatever I can for my own daughter to raise her to believe in God.  One last thought and I'll quit.   It doesn't mean she has to stay in the same denomination we are now.  There are a lot of good churches out there, so long as the core beliefs are the same.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Intelligent decision-10 and up. Same for encouragement.<br>  <br>  I convey my beliefs to them as a matter of opinion, and that I may be wrong.<br>  I have told them repeatedly that I drew my conclusions because I have studied, and indeed, am thoroughly interested in, other cultures and religions. It works for me, may not work for them, and if they want to study or get a glimpse of other beliefs, I will go with them to meetings/services. Point illustrated, I am a vegetarian but I cook meat for my husband and kids.<br>  I would quit talking about it when they showed no interest.<br>  And because you were bold enough to state that you are agnostic up there (opening up yourself for criticism),(admirable), I will mention that I am Pagan. I don't force it on my kids, but they do happen to gravitate towards it themselves.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My parents shoved their religion down my throat growing up and I hated it. My husbands parents were the same way, so we decided that they can go to church with us (were christian) until they choose not to. Whatever age that is. Neither one of us are the religion that we grew up with. My parents are mormons and so are his. It's not a bad religion, but I just don't believe in it. I will always have conversations about religion with my children no matter what religion they choose to be. They are my children and my love for them is unconditional. They have every right to choose what religion is right for them, even if that choice is no religion.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i think when they start to ask about it, i dont mean like a 5 year old in general asking about certain religions probably more teen years. i would supprt anything my daughter wanted to do in that terms but i probably wouldnt encourge it until she was more adult. teens and chilren can chop and change there minds so easily as can adults, but adults have a more realistic approach to things. i would never force a religion on my child. i wouldnt force nothing ie if i was vegan i would encourage them to eat different to me intil they made up there own minds.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	i wouldnt talk to my child about religion<br>  im firmly atheist and in england RE is taught at least once a week from year 1 to year 11 in schools so that is where my children will learn about religion<br>  <br>  sure if they ask me about it il talk to them but i wont sit down and tell them theres a man in the sky who made us <br>  its insane|`|rAkWoweOaa	As soon as they can understand you. I will make sure that my son knows that the Lord is our savior and died for our sins. I knew that at a very young age and I want him to know that as well. Especially in these times.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	When the child starts asking questions about it.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I wouldn't think a child really "gets it" until 16ish...at least not fully.  They can understand religion earlier than that, but I don't think they can really appreciate it fully until later.  I agree that they will just gravitate to whatever they are taught until then.  I very clearly remember my best friend and her family were devout 7th Day Adventists until one day she realized that even though she read the bible every day and followed all of these beliefs her parents did, she had no idea why she was doing it so she stopped.  We were both almost 16 and it had just never occurred to her before.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I feel that religion is a deeply personal thing and I will tell my daughter that.  I will explain to her what I believe, and we will discuss what others believe, and I will let her know that it's up to everyone to decide what makes sense to them.  As long as she's a good person, I don't really care what she believes in.|`|prqrQcd1aa	This topic came into discussion between my oldest daughter and I yesterday. She was telling me how someone was going to go to "hell" for doing something... That really discouraged me, I explained to her that according to the bible you are not suppose to judge others, and it's not her say on who goes to hell or not, I also told her that I didn't think hell was a real place like is taught in church and so on. I told her it's not fire and brimstone... she looked at me and told me that it was and that was what she had learned in church...<br>  She wanted to go to sunday school to learn about God and Jesus, so I allowed her to. I grew up not having to go to church, but being able to make my own decisions as to what churches i'd like to go to with friends and so on. <br>  I don't believe that at her age she is old enough or mature enough to understand the ways I feel about religion. In fact I told her yesterday that we would have the discussion about "hell" when she was a lot older! I'm thinking between the ages of 13-15 we will have that discussion. I will tell her everything that I know and she can make her own decisions based on the "full" knowledge of things that are put in front of her. If she isn't interested in it, then I will not force it down her throat!|`|G9wEDvedaa	well im catholic and how my religion goes is when your a baby your parents baptise you, then when your in grade 2 you have your first holly communion, then in grade 8 when your 14 you decided on your own if you want to have a confirmation which basically means you belive in god and want to continue with your catholic religion. You get a sponsor from your family and a priest puts holly water on your forehead. The next step is getting married and if you never went through all of those things as a child your not suppose to be allowed to.<br>  <br>  i like the system, 14 seems old enough to make a decision.|`|uBAP6sqzaa	I'm Catholic and brought have brought my kids up that way. However I think it's up to them what they want to believe in. My oldest two are 15 and 14 and no longer believe in God, but my other two who are 12 and 5 do, so I ask my oldest two to respect that and to not say anything about God not being real to them. My youngest is only 2 so obviously she doesn't know anything about religion.<br>  <br>  I have said to my kids that no one knows for sure whether or not there is a God and rightfully they have a choice whether they believe, it doesn't make them any worse of a person.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	i will teach my children what i belive, i will not say its the absolute one and only truth, but it is what i believe,<br>  i will also take them to church with me, until they are 15, at around then, they should be able to make their own choice,<br>  i won't disown, or shun them because of religion, thats stupid,<br>  ii would be a bit disapointed if they went down a different path, but its their choice.<br>  i will also give them some knowledge about other religions, <br>  i hope my children turn out to be kind, respectful, moral people|`|A9etUnnfaa	age 10<br>  between 7 - 9 their going to be Curious|`|CKW4PPJLaa	13|`|1KIwM1uOaa	My husband and I are Catholic nd had our kids baptized in the church as well as doing the first communion thing.  Before it was time for our oldest to have her confirmation she went to the Baptist church with a friend of hers and really liked it and wanted to go again.  now two years later she goes to the baptist church and only goes to mass with us on special occasions.  Our 11 year old has also started showing more interest in the baptist church than the Catholic and as with er sister the decision will be hers.  I do not feel it is right fr a parent to make a child be a certain religion we are all individuals and all have our own beliefs.  I listen to my kids tell me about what they believe or what they got from church service and they respect their father ad I in our beliefs as well.  Personally I do not care where they go to church as long as they go and believe in what they learn.  If they want to go they will continue if you make them go to yours it is apunishment to them and they resent it.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	I don't enforce religion on my son. <br>  <br>  I was raised by my grandmother for a while growing up, and whenever I miss behaved, she would make me say a decade of rosary three times, with her watching me, as a punishment. This was in the late 80s when I would have only been six years old (old irish catholic family !!) & from that age on, I have had no interest in religion at all. She made me see it as a negative aspect in my eyes, and I don't like to think about. <br>  <br>  My son goes to a catholic school, because in Ireland, there are only 1 or 2 international schools in the entire country. They teach religion but not in detail, only about respect & Jesus etc ... we don't enforce religion on him. He is catholic, was baptized and in three years will make his communion, simply because it would upset our families if he didn't  !! If he deiced to have no interest in religion, fine, neither do me of my husband. If he decides he's religious, fine .... I won't love him any less for using his mind & making choice's in his life !! He hasn't expressed any interest so far, but he's only 5 ....
B7iSU8UYaa	No. You're a great mom to be so concerned for your children! As moms, we have to remember the airline safety tip, put your own oxygen mask on before assisting others. Sometimes you need to take care of yourself to be effective caring for others. <br>  <br>  It's best to have naptime for everyone. If your 3 year old won't nap, put on a movie in the same or nearby room, give him a snack and tell him to wake you up when it's done (and set the alarm for yourself anyway). Make sure the 3 month old is safe in the bed and have a great nap!|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	no not at all! Sometimes i do that with my 4 and 2 year old.

My 6th and 7th pregnancies were a breeze while my 5th was full of so much pain (back pain) that my husband had to do all the shopping. I could not walk for 5 minutes. The pain does not mean labor is coming.|`|MqFeJiukaa	Besides every pregnancy being different the more times you are pregnant the more relaxed your body is.  The way my midwife described this is your body already knows what to do so there is no resistance.  With back pain I know that with this pregnancy I have had the worst sciatica I have ever had and my midwife said because the uterus and hips are relaxed and stretching it is putting pressure on my back.  Unfortunately it don't mean you will go into labor any sooner.  I am 39 weeks with my 5th and my 4th was born at 41 weeks and 6 days and my 1st was 41 weeks and 4 days.  I wish it did lol.  Good Luck.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Every pregnancy is different.  If you are concerned you should contact your Dr. <br>  I'm not sure what type of pain you are having.  Sore joints, sore back etc, thats all normal.  If the pain in your back is extreme, it could be back labor.
vTra7n5baa	Unless you're dying and don't care about living anymore, I mostly agree with this outlook.  If you have sex, you have to be responsible to be better off.  This includes:<br>  <br>  1) AIDS and STD screening.<br>  2) Pregnancy suspicions.<br>  3) Spending money on protection, which can add up.<br>  4) Knowing that sex is not 100% safe.   This includes oral and anal, as well as other things.<br>  5) Knowing that sex will not always be satisfying.  Sometimes it is; sometimes it isn't.<br>  6) Knowing that your partner has a sexual and emotional history too.  The may treat you insignificantly afterwards.<br>  <br>  These are all very adult things and add stress to your life.  The only way not to have these stresses (and possibly include the quality of your life) is not to have sex.|`|jxdMIAoBaa	Most definitely|`|FZZFJ6awaa	Dont forget to read the fine print!|`|9CC4k8Bcaa	I kind of wish it was like that but in today's society it isn;t|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No. But I think it should be.

EYU5ZZkgaa	Because the school is not paying for it, nothing at all will happen. I would urge the school to pay for it - if it is necessary, this is their job. Schools often take advantage of parents who don't know any better, but by law, it is their job to provide FAPE - a Free and Appropriate Public Education for all students. If this evaluation is necessary for your children s success, the  school must provide this for free. They also must, by law evaluate your children for free if you give them written notice, with in 90 days. This is the law, visit http://www.wrightslaw.com/ for more information regarding special education and the law.    The situation is different if your children are in a private system. because of 504, the school must accommodate them for any disabilities they may have, but are not required to identify or evaluate them, in which case - you pay.    Like I said, not a lot will happen if you don't have a subsequent evaluation, but some things may NOT happen. Your children s progress may slow, because their needs change, especially if it has been more than three years. A child's brain is constantly growing and changing, and it is very easy to see how one learns from these evaluations. With out them, the school may no longer be providing the right type of education.    If you are outside the states, let me know where you are, I might still be able to help, as I am not from the states either.    I hope your five year old is in speech therapy for his speech delay. And where as your seven year old may not need another psycho-educational assessment, I would have s/he see a psychologist to work on self esteem and confidence building activities, as well as talking about emotions and how to handle them. The reason I say this, is because children with learning disabilities tend to have issues in these areas, and as the school material gets harder, the issues may become more intense. Also emotional and self esteem disorders can also impact learning, and will make it even harder for your child to reach his or her full potential.     If you are dissatisfied with your previous psychologist, definitely find another.    Good luck. If you have any more questions fell free to email me.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I would.

I would certainly want to know if my children needed extra help and if that extra help was doing them any good. I would take them in just to see if what progress has been made. I do agree on not putting them on medications. I really don't understand how its hurting your children by trying to help them?? The schools aren't out to cause harm, so I wouldn't treat them as such.

My son has ADHD and our primary care doctor sees him every 3 months and gives us prescription for meds. if your child does not need the meds then that's fine. I wouldn't worry about it. Lots of teachers try to push for the meds as in some kids they are better behaved while on them (our son needs them) don't let them bully you on this.

TE7foNwMaa	Girls:<br>  Maura Grace -- I love Maura, it's absolutely gorgeous. Just as a warning...Grace is considered "filler". It's definitely beautiful, and has a great meaning, but I'm not sure how concerned you are with "filler" middle names. I do think the "r" in Grace makes it only slightly hard to say with Maura. Only when repeated several times out loud though... It's still fine. And I still love Maura. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Eva Scarlett -- I think this one's great. Eva's wonderful, since Ava's rather popular... Eva's still fresh and not overused, though. Scarlett is a great middle name. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Audrina Michelle -- I like Michelle, possibly because it's the name of one of my best friends... Audrina seems a bit annoyingly "fairy" to me. Just my opinion, it seems slightly overly cutesy, and almost worse than just Audrey itself. It's not really my favorite... 5 / 10<br>  <br>  Angela Renee -- Angela is okay. I know a girl with this name, but she generally goes by Angelie... She's a bit of a snot of a girl, kind of annoying if you're around her too much, but I don't think her name's absolutely horrible. I would just never be able to use it because of her. Renee is a great middle name, though. It flows well. 6 / 10<br>  <br>  Leah Suzanne -- Leah's extremely popular... I think it's a gorgeous name, but would never personally use it because of the popularity. Only number 43, but still rather popular... Suzanne is a great middle name though, and flows especially well with Leah. I love the middle name. 6 / 10<br>  <br>  Clara Marie -- Marie's another middle name that's considered "filler", if that's a problem. Clara's absolutely gorgeous. I love it, it's a great name. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Kylie Brooke -- It's okay, it is cute, but not my favorite. It flows really well, and that's always nice. I definitely do like the name, just not quite as much as some of the others. 7 / 10<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  Joshua Taylor -- I love Joshua. A friend of mine recently named her son Joshua, but he didn't end up living for very long...it was extremely sad, and I quite possibly love the name because of her. Taylor does make it sound rather like a last name. It gives it an Andy Griffith flair in my opinion... Andy Taylor... But I think it's fine... I do like it better than Joshua Brooks. I think both Taylor and Brooks make it sound rather "country" though. Either one is fine, but I like Taylor a bit more with it. Though Joshua is number 29 in popularity. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Joel Wesley -- I love this one. I like Joel Wesley much more than Joel Ronald (Joel Ronald would probably get a 7 / 10 from me). I think Joel sounds great with Wesley, and they're both great names. It's number 95 in popularity, which isn't bad. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Isaac Lee -- I think this one's fine. I love Isaac... a friend of mine has a one year old with this name. He's absolutely adorable, and I think of him when I hear the name. I really like it. Lee is great, too. Though Isaac is number 42 on the popularity deal...but I still love it. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Noah Douglas -- Noah's extremely popular, also... Number 3, actually... I think it's a great name, but it's another that I would never personally use until the popularity died down a bit. I love Douglas with it though, it flows wonderfully. 6 / 10<br>  <br>  (I skipped Joel Ronald because I partially rated it in my opinion of Joel Wesley)<br>  <br>  Elijah Robert -- This one's nice. It's also pretty popular though... number 17... But it's a good name. Robert sounds great with it, I love it with Elijah. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  (skipped Joshua Brooks because I partially rated it in my opinion of Joshua Taylor)<br>  <br>  <br>  I really liked most of the names. My absolute favorites are...<br>  Maura Grace and Isaac Lee. But I really like the others, also. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|VHHis05Naa	Maura Grace--very nice<br>  Eva Scarlett--love<br>  Audrina Michelle--not a fan<br>  Angela Renee--very bland <br>  Leah Suzanne--love<br>  Clara Marie--spice it up with something other than the boring Marie<br>  Kylie Brooke--boring<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  Joshua Taylor--boring<br>  Joel Wesley--nice<br>  Isaac Lee--blah<br>  Noah Douglas--ok<br>  Joel Ronald--ick hate Ronald<br>  Elijah Robert--nice<br>  Joshua Brooks--blah|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Kylie Brook and Clara Marie<br>  <br>  Joshua Taylor and Noah Douglas|`|AA11138222	Maura Grace--6 I like Mara better though.<br>  Eva Scarlett--7 I think I would like this one flipped the other way.<br>  Audrina Michelle--2 Yuck<br>  Angela Renee--2 Yuck<br>  Leah Suzanne--6 Like Leah, Suzanne sounds like an older lady to me.<br>  Clara Marie--5 Clara is pretty, Marie is a filler name.<br>  Kylie Brooke--5 Not crazy about these two together.<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  <br>  Joshua Taylor--6 I dislike the name Tayor but Joshua is cute.<br>  Joel Wesley--5 I think Wesley Joel flows better, and I like the nickname Wes.<br>  Isaac Lee--3 Not crazy about either of these names.<br>  Noah Douglas--5 I don't like Douglas, but Noah is okay.<br>  Joel Ronald--2 Yuck<br>  Elijah Robert--8 This is the best of the choices.<br>  Joshua Brooks--3 Brooks sounds like a last name.|`|T1qzML1Zaa	Girls:<br>  1.

uj1A73ZGaa	I also have two Graco infant seats for my twin girls both of our car seats were getting stuck as well and I called the company and they are sending me new ones. So I would call the company.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	There is a latch on the back of the base (just under the latch that releases the seat from the base).  If the Base isn't at the correct angle...this latch can catch, so the seat doesn't release.<br>  <br>  I noticed it b/c I switched the base from one car to another, but didn't adjust the part that levels the base.  I didn't wanna mess with it & then put it back in my car & have to adjust AGAIN.  But then I realized that if the base is tilted...that latch falls into place & keeps the seat from coming out!  I hope that made sense...lol!|`|bc9inzicaa	I have a Chicco Keyfit 30 and it never gets stuck.

They have certified car seat specialists there.<br>  <br>  Also is there any way you can see if there is something wedged in there?
24oK8bmSaa	i had a huge birthday planned for my 2 year old and only 1 child RSVP so instead i had a small gathering of all the people who loves my son at my place with cake, ice cream and a few little things to eat. we just all had a really good time talking and enjoying each others time. <br>  its really hard at that age, when you don't have too many children to invite and the weather isn't too nice.<br>  also you can try to take your son and his friend to the movies and have a fun movie day outing|`|H6vGFMeIaa	Take them out to an arcade. The kids will love it, because it is a small group you don't have to worry about a kid getting lost, and because many parents are there it will be easier to let kids to what they want.

They use to let the kid build their own pizza|`|KHdoz1f9aa	Take him to disney world or for an adventure...........|`|QUFAKk1paa	byob|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	Stay at your place and have your food. What I believe would be very fun, is if you plan on making home-made pizzas. They are easy and simple, and you can have the two boys help out. Kids love spreading cheese and toppings onto a pizza! If you're going to have a cake, maybe you can also do a small batch of cupcakes on the side. Let the kids help ice the cupcakes and give them sprinkles and candles to put on as well. Get another parent or two to help out.<br>  <br>  You can decorate the place so that it's fun for the children. Balloons, ribbons, streamers, party hats and such. You can pick out your son's favorite movie (such as Marry Poppins) and have that going, and you can also set out some coloring books with crayons.<br>  <br>  Since it's only two children (not including your baby), having games will be a bit difficult. You can do Simon Says, Red Light Green Light, maybe even charades. Be sure to play a few rounds of each game so that both boys have an opportunity to win.<br>  <br>  One more idea I can think of, is to buy two disposable cameras. Give one to each of the boys, and ask them to take pictures of the party throughout the day. Of course, you can also take pictures yourself so that they will be clear and straight. But the point is that the children will love having their own cameras to take pictures with!<br>  <br>  Go ahead and do party bags for the boys, they will both really like that. Have fun!|`|unlpwEDMaa	Invite guest his age so he can actually have fun...<br>  you can't go wrong with chuck.e.cheese!|`|AA12221392	just have some ice cream, and cake. Hand out some little goodie bags to the other child. give them some noise makers and so forth. If you are only going to have one other child there except the birthday boy, maybe just have some fun activities that the two of them like to do. <br>  <br>  If you are not wanting to have this at home, just go to a child friendly place and have a dinner and birthday wishes with cake and ice cream (mcDonalds, some pizza places,) the adults can sit around and gab, and share stories, and the kids can have a good time playing...|`|JsqMSU9Haa	oh it will be a nice party dont you worry!  little kids need 1 or 2 kids to play with and they are happy.  do a brunch at the house since its mostly adults - fruits, bagels, quiche - and have some kid friendly mac n cheese or something like that.  big cake.  snacks.  go to the craft store and get a bunch of crafts for the 2 kids to do - coloring, painting, glueing, stickers - they will have a ball!!|`|H6I0vEoWaa	Have it at home  , have like a backyard Bar-B Q party, and you could have a few games set out for the kids or something .<br>  <br>  <br>  Mine Please ?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsRky7rWewGDQg2V6hBPrULAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220115454AAEcK18">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|MMCaaZFyaa	Invite the fathers over and strip for them.|`|6CU00J1Yaa	Take him and his friend to see Friday the 13th.

vygYFdsSaa	That actually used to happen to me if I was late taking a pill.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	No I don't think you are pregnant. Missing your pill can cause you to spot. Brown spotting a week and a half before your period is not a sign of pregnancy.  For future reference, when you say things like Preggie test, it makes you sound like a 13 yr old. No offense, just being honest.<br>  <br>  It wasn't an insult..just a heads up. Usually ladies that use those terms on here..Preggie, Preggo, Preggers..get a lot of nasty comments bc it usually means it is coming from a teenager. I answer a lot of questions on here and see it all the time. People can be mean. Just letting you know..you can speak however you want, doesn't mean anything to me.

I always put it back in though and I would never dream of emptying out their savings account, especially of money they earned at a job.  So while I would borrow money from my kids, I would never steal their money and that is exactly what they did to you.  I'm not sure if there is anything you can do about it except move on.  Make sure your bank account is in your name only and start saving again.  Maybe your grandmother will give you a little money to start out on your own with.

From the time I was 12 when I started babysitting I always had to buy my own clothes, pay for my own lunch at school, buy my own school supplies, pay my own way to the movies, pay for my own haircuts...I even had to buy my own shampoo and hairspray!   So that is likely where all you money went too, except they did it for you.<br>  <br>  I didn't get a car either. AND, I had to pay for my own college. But you know what? Now I am a happy, successful, hard working person, and I'm none the worse for wear.<br>  <br>  There is nothing you can do to change it, so now is the time to start over...open your own bank account, get a job and start saving/paying for what you need.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	NO, but my mom did that to me, so that is probably why I would never do that.<br>  And not buying you a car isnt a big deal, not alot of parents buy their kids a first car.<br>  My parents never bought me anything bigger than a 200 dollar gift card.

It sounds like your family may need counseling. Talk to a 24 hour counseling center over the phone and see if the communnity offers free or cheap services.
WPI0Z47saa	Your chances of losing it are probably quite low if you are getting proper prenatal care. I am sure your doctor would have mentiond to you if you were high risk. Babies have a fighting chance at 25 weeks where more than half live. Good luck.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	they say 24 weeks is the mark for that... at 22 weeks I have heard that they wont even try which I think is ridiculous...  But try not to worry!  Keep that baby in there as long as you can|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Generally the baby is considered to have some reasonable chance of living after 24 weeks. Sometimes the baby can live before that but their chances are much much lower (at 22 weeks its under 10% chance of surviving I think). Every baby is going to be different in terms of their chances of survival and their health though and every single day the baby stays in the uterus their chances of survival increase by a few percent. <br>  <br>  Usually after the first trimester women have a pretty low risk of miscarriage. But women with bicornuate uterus usually have a higher risk of late miscarriage and also a higher risk of preterm labor than other women. <br>  You should ask your doctor about all of this though, not everyone is going to have the same problems and lots of women with bicornuate uterus do carry their baby to full term without any health issues.|`|IlSALGKMaa	A baby CAN live outside the womb at 22 weeks, but it would have a lot of problems and have to stay in the hospital for a long time and would most likely have medical problems it's whole life. Every one says the chances are slim at losing a baby after 12 weeks... Which is true. I wouldn't worry about it if your doctor isn't worried.<br>  <br>  Though my friend's sister carried her baby to term and it died the day before her due date and she had to give a regular birth. They didn't find a reason for it, but she was a huge pot head, so I think that's why, personally.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	to ease your mind ask your doctor this question at your next appt.<br>  <br>  i have heard of premie babies making it after 28 weeks...<br>  <br>  i think it's very rare they can survive at 22 weeks.<br>  <br>  when you do have a baby as early as 28 weeks they usually have to stay at the niuc...i believe that's the name of the hospital.<br>  <br>  go to google and type in "fetus surviving at 22 weeks"<br>  <br>  that should pull up some info for ya.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|IA5zVfk0aa	its quite low but there are those times, my friend lost her baby at 5 months :( but now shes pregnant again 6 months :) , I will pray for a healthy you and baby :)|`|LFXTpqfdaa	I have a bicornuate uterus too. I am 25 weeks into my first pregnancy. There are varying degrees of this abnormality, but since you're already pregnant they won't be able to tell the degree too well because the fetus changes the shape of the uterus. <br>  <br>  With specialized prenatal care, you will most likely have a successful pregnancy, don't worry. But this means you must consult with a perinatalogist. If you haven't yet, go NOW. As the baby gets bigger, he/she will need to be monitored carefully for problems. My OB's plan for my pregnancy was not adequate.<br>  <br>  There is a 30% chance of early labor, so my high-risk specialist recommended that I have a cervical scan every 2 weeks to make sure that the baby isn't planning on making an early arrival. They started doing these scans at 16 weeks, and they really help to set my mind at ease.<br>  <br>  There is also a 50% chance that the baby will be breech (butt or foot first). This is because the misshapen uterus makes it difficult for the baby to turn head down during the last month of pregnancy. Usually this means a C-section, so be prepared.<br>  <br>  The doctors should also watch the baby's growth very carefully to make sure he/she is growing normally, starting now for you. Sometimes a bicornate uterus does not stretch as much as it should and can stunt the baby's growth. <br>  <br>  Here is my pregnancy plan, formed by me and my perinatalogist:<br>  <br>  ? Cervical scans every 2 weeks starting at 16 weeks to check for early dialation. Cerclage, bed rest, or drugs can stop early labor in most cases, esp if caught early.<br>  ? Check for kidney abnormalities. You have a 30% chance of having missing, extra, or misplaced kidneys with a bicornate uterus. This should be done as soon as possible because differences in kidney function may affect drug dosages and such during delivery.<br>  ? High-level ultrasounds with Doppler scans at 20 wks, 24 wks, 28 wks, and 32 wks.<br>  ? Ultrasounds every month after 32 weeks until delivery to monitor growth of baby and uterus.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and again, see that perinatalogist ASAP. It might make the difference between a healthy baby and a failed pregnancy.|`|mlFCag9Raa	I also have a bicornuate uterus and am due 6/26/09 with a girl.

VHHis05Naa	I'm so sorry for what happened to you and I applaud your courage for speaking out.  I was also sexually abused as a child and know very well that lingering pain.  :(  <br>  <br>  Write it down and give it to her if that's what you can do.  Let that digest and when you are ready, go ahead and talk.   Or, if you're ready to talk now, take your time.  This is incredibly painful stuff and it needs to come out only when you are ready to tell and feel you can handle the aftermath of reliving it.  You definitely need some support.  <br>  <br>  My experience was that telling really helped me to start healing from that miserable pain and freeing myself from all nonsensical guilty feelings I felt.  I was only six, so I knew it wasn't my fault, but it was empowering to know that other people knew that as well.  <br>  <br>  If you start to tell and can't finish, that's perfectly ok.  Take a day, a week, a month, whatever...to pull it together and try again.  <br>  <br>  My heart aches for the little girls you and I once were.  Today, I am not the same as I might have been had it not happened, but I am a survivor.  I am strong and determined that my daughter have the childhood I was denied.  Good luck to you.  You have survived, so keep fighting.|`|MIUzgwsTaa	ohh not you and these sexual abuse questions again!|`|OpVysSzQaa	is it still going on or is this a childhood issue? to me, it would be easier to talk about it if its in the past.<br>  <br>  for me, (someone who went through intense sexual abuse entire childhood) its easiest to just come straight out with it.

rxjdovzyaa	Yea, it does sound like your parents are overbearing, and very anxious that you succeed. I suggest you and your parents meet with the school guidance counselor about exactly what is required to get into an Ivy league school.  You will find that not only does it require excellent academics (which you seem to have) but a lot of extracurricular activities as well.  When your parents hear this from the counselor, they should ease up on you an allow you to start participating in some extras like sports and clubs. It is also important that you display leadership skills, which requires an appropriate amount of socialization.  This may not get you into PG13 movies, but it may get you out of the house and on to some dates.  Good luck!|`|fe401dd46986e89544dfbc5536d4d364aa	Now that I'm 24 and waaaaayyy out of junior high and high school I can honestly tell you that how well you do in junior high means absolutely nothing. And if you're already getting all A's there you should have no problem at all doing the same in high school. After that, you're free to do whatever you want. Your parents just want you to succeed but don't worry too much about making them happy. You're doing great.|`|OuA2cQ8haa	is it fair? no<br>  <br>  should they trust you more ? yes<br>  <br>  does this make them bad parents who will give you psy problems? not at all , if more parents cared about education there would be less losers in the world , yes its difficult  and boring and until your 18 you wont be able to have alot of teen fun but the rewards for the rest of your life that your parents cared enough to push you when you were young are priceless , they are over protective because they love you so much and you are very very lucky|`|ASXeYOjAaa	- Overbearing is in the eye of the beholder.<br>  - It is empirically proved that "Ivy League" schools make you stupider than people who skip college completely.

I would also suggest you get a webcam, and ask her father to get one as well. She can use it to say good night, and have the added security of "seeing" her father.

qayCggxMaa	You might try using a supplemental breastfeeding system - basically a tube that holds formula and attaches to your breast so that if she does suck on the breast she will get something (formula) which will encourage her to keep sucking.  I used one briefly when I was having nursing problems with my daughter.  They can be awkward to use, but it might be worth a try.

Some of the babies who might benefit include:<br>  <br>      * a newborn (or older adopted baby) trying to figure out how to breastfeed<br>      * a previously-weaned baby whom you wish to breastfeed again<br>      * a baby who seriously resists nursing (or even being placed in a nursing position)<br>      * a baby with nipple confusion<br>      * a baby who is a fussy nurser (but does not completely refuse the breast)<br>      * a baby on a nursing strike<br>  <br>  Even if you have a baby who adamantly resists nursing, getting your baby to breast is very possible but it will probably require time, patience, and kangaroo-style frequency. Expect "two steps forward and one step backward."<br>  <br>  If you're getting discouraged working with your non-nursing baby, read this: My Baby Just Doesn't Get It. If you have a newborn who is not latching on, do keep in mind that almost all reluctant nursers will start latching by four to eight weeks of life.|`|93Pq7zVtaa	Same here. it all depends on how old the baby is. If she is younger than 12 weeks she'll get the hang of it. If she's older than that it will be difficult. keep trying, babies almost always start latching-it took me 3 months.|`|FXINmF6saa	I had the same exact problem with my son. He absolutely hated my breast and would only drink it out of the bottle. I didn't know what to do so I called these nurses that were recommended by the hospital. They tried to help by giving me tips on how to help him take the breast but he never did. Kids get lazy and when you introduce them to the bottle they get use to the fact that they don't have to do anything but let the bottle squirt itself. And the reason why you're not pumping enough milk for your baby to eat, is because you're getting so stressed out that your baby is not eating that your body doesn't produce enough milk. When you pump try to relax and not think about your stress. Try to do it when your baby is sleeping and not crying that will just frustrate you more. Try to pump out allot of bottles and put them in the freezer and when your baby is ready to eat feed her. Also when you feed her try and relax and nurture her that way she doesn't feel the heavy vibes. Good Luck|`|yB5go5wbaa	When I came home from the hospital, I couldn't get my baby to latch on either, and I pumped and bottle fed.  He latches on now, and he's only 2 weeks old, but for a week he wouldn't do it.  I know that that's no where near your 3 week gap, but the lactation consultant at my hospital said that he wasn't latching on because of my letdown.  If she's not getting any milk, she's not going to want to latch on.  Until you have a good letdown of your milk, don't be worried if she's fussy at the breast.  My son would get, and still does get, very very angry if he can't get milk right when he wants, haha.  I keep pushing my nipple in his mouth though, and sometimes it takes 5 minutes (at which point, I'm practically exploding) for him to really latch ...and my milk is in!  Keep trying and try getting ahold of another lactation consultant (never hurts to have 2 people to go to for resources).<br>  <br>  Don't give up on feeding at the breast, you can do it!  And it's so awesome that you've managed to regain your supply!
vigFmfLmaa	You sound a lot like me.  I was 19 when I went to the dr b/c we couldn't get pregnant.  I had no idea even what PCOS was but I did have lots of ovarian cysts in high school.  I wasn't skinny by any means but I didn't really consider myself fat and I didn't have any other symptoms.  But I went in and they ran some blood tests and found that I was insulin resistant which is a condition that occurs often in women with PCOS.  Over the years I've developed almost every symptoms associated with PCOS.  If you think you have it you should see a dr right away so he can start to help you.  <br>  <br>  They didn't put me on bcps again, but did prescribe metformin.  That made me horribly sick and finally 2 doctors later I got the extended realease version which is considerably better.  We've been TTC for almost 7 years now, even with fertility treatments, with no luck.|`|AVzQs5Uhaa	though I have not had  it i almost had the same thing as you, they though I had PCOS but it turned out that I was low in the hormones that made your body bring on your period. Your best bet if you are worried about it  is to go to your gyno they will have to do an pelvic exam and draw some blood to see if you are low in any hormones. usually you have acne, weight gain, extra hair on the face and neck IE chin hair, best bet is to contact your gyno since every ones symptoms are different and some experience next to none.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://women.webmd.com/tc/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos-topic-overview" rel="nofollow">http://women.webmd.com/tc/polycystic-ova...</a>

Usually they have a hood, are typically white, and embellished.  The most common material is a basket weave, but some newer ones are plastic lined with crepe/organza.  Usually a baby will only fit in one of these for a few weeks.  My son never fit in his.<br>  <br>  A cradle rocks or glides back and forth, presumably to rock baby to sleep.  Most of these have short bars that do not lower, and some have the option to be held still.  These are for babies up to 3 months old (cannot roll over, sit, or pull up).

wZAeBisbaa	There's two questions here, I think. <br>  <br>  1. Is it OK to let her think her saved pennies are enough to buy all of you dinner?  I'd be truthful and say "I'm sorry but that isn't enough."  It might demonstrate that eating out is really expensive - so expensive that all her money isn't enough.  It's not too early to understand that some things cost more than we have.<br>  <br>  2. Should she be allowed to spend her money any way she wants?  I'd say yes, but only some of it.  It's also not too early to learn about saving and money management.  Why not designate one piggy bank to use for whatever she wants - even McDonald's.  Designate the others for savings.  When she gets some money, no matter how small the amount is, she splits it between the spending and savings banks.  The "savings" bank doesn't get touched unless you and she agree that there is a need.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I would have done the same thing.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you start turning in the full piggy banks and start a savings account for her?  It's free and it's easy.<br>  <br>  If you REALLY feel bad you could make a deal with her that if she's a good girl and a good helper throughout the week she can have 4$ from her bank (or from your pocket- whichever you prefer)  to buy a happy meal for herself only.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	I think you did right.  You should talk with her and come up with something that she is saving for and then let her buy that item when she has enough money.  That way, when she says "Well, I have money in my piggy bank" you can respond with "you are saving that money for a Kit American Girl doll".|`|OuA2cQ8haa	what you did was totally morally right even if your step daughter doesnt understand , dont worry about it|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	two words DOLLAR MENU= my best friend|`|UYnAASPJaa	could have let her bought her own dinner. and you still eat at home. or compromise and let her buy herself a snack. it don't hurt to let them pay for things once in awhile. just make sure she understands that once she spends the money it is gone, help her make wise spending choice,buy us dinner tonight no toy later or eat at home and save money for that cool toy. maybe Mcd is what she really wants. sometimes i just don't want to eat at home too.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I don't see the harm in letting her spend her piggy bank money on some mcd's, especially if it'll make her happy.  I see that she's your step-daughter though, so you might want to ask your husband first.  My son has bought all kinds of things with his piggy money.  We have a seperate account for college that doesn't get spent.  I figure the piggy money is just for fun and for learning how to save.  He's 4 too.
5vtVsqx6aa	I can relate. I have a short last name as well.<br>  <br>  I would think a first name that has 2, 3, or 4 syllables would work the best.  Also, avoid rhyming. <br>  <br>  Something else to keep in mind is the nicknames of longer names can be shorter. Ex: Nicholas Bean turns into Nick Bean.  (If you like that, that's fine!) I just found that I would like longer first names with a shorter last name.<br>  <br>  So maybe names that cannot be shortened are the key! <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|XDgZUkrWaa	I think any name that's not too cutesy will be fine.  But 'cute, little' names like Lucy, Lilly, Ruby, etc. wouldn't work.  <br>  <br>  As for names that would, it depends on your taste, but I think longer, more serious names like Elizabeth, Katherine, Charlotte, Harper, Alexandra, Juliet, Eleanor, Ingrid, Gretchen, Amelia, etc. would work well.|`|dAniZ4ouaa	Girls:<br>  <br>  Veronica Bean<br>  Charlotte Jaime(Jay-mie) Bean<br>  Danielle Riley Bean<br>  Sarah Janet Bean<br>  Carline Jaen Bean<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  Shane Tyler Bean<br>  Daniel Tyler Bean<br>  Joshua Marc Bean<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|8OoqHpbIaa	SEAN <br>  <br>  LIKE THE ACTOR :)|`|MXzIIgQhaa	ooohh... um lets see...<br>  <br>  alexandra bean<br>  <br>  makayla/michaela/etc. bean<br>  <br>  cassandra bean<br>  <br>  jennifer bean<br>  <br>  arianna bean<br>  <br>  olivia bean<br>  <br>  katherine bean<br>  <br>  usually names with 3 or 4 syllables work with one syllable last names, but of course there are exceptions.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!!!

145RUNQHaa	The problem with snatching something away from a toddler that is obviously precious to him is that you create a possible insecurity problem.if he's screaming for three hours then he is not ready to give it up and by the way there is no harm in sucking on the end of a bottle if it comforts him and helps him sleep it can only be beneficial.a teat end of a bottle is soft and flexible same as a pacifier it's not like thumb sucking there's little or no risk to his teeth he's a little young to be worrying about that.don't be tempted to snip off the end to me that is tampering and weakening the teat therefore creating a possibly dangerous choking hazard it's probably best not to try that one.there will come a time when he will be more willing to let it go with less fuss and upset.wait for that time.you could leave it out for father christmas in exchange for presents when he's old enough to understand it will go more smoothly.or you could let him give it up in his own time it's only a little comfort in the privacy of his own room after all.x|`|Po2UqfvWaa	you just keep it away. yes, he will scream and yell and throw a fit. after awhile, he'll stop. the longer you wait, the worse it gets. let him see that they will all be thrown away. that way he'll know you can not get them anymore. get him a special cup and that's that|`|4WyUrWaIaa	From this day on, snip away a little bit off the nipple, and in a few days it will be gone, and he won't care.|`|sAbah6dTaa	He won't have any problems with his teeth unless he does it over age four. my daughter has her paci until she was two, then on her birthday we bought some balloons and then tied the paci to the balloons and let her watch them float way, saying that they had to go to the new babies that needed it. she cried for a couple of hours because she hadn't went a day in two years with out it, but the next day she was fine, but she did talk about it a lot, saying that it went to the sky to the new babies. she was such a sport, id do it again in a heartbeat =)|`|waVPtmAEaa	I wouldn't be too concerned about his teeth, he will eventually grow out of the pacifier sucking,as my son did around age 4. Believe it or not, sucking on a bottle/binky really done not have an effect on teeth, except mabe a slight over bite which can be corrected.  Especially sense he has trouble sleeping, I would recommend letting his keep the pacifier or bottle for now|`|X0ul35wQaa	I think that you should try giving him a new source of comfort, such as a stuffed animal or a soft blanket. Even though you said you tried all the binky's, there is one called "soothie" and its JUST like a bottle nipple. Also, my little one is still using a binky and he's almost three. We talked to our pediatrician, and she told us that as long as he isn't going to kindergarden with it, he's fine, and its not going to harm his teeth.|`|0EL8ojumaa	if you are talking about him trying to stop his habit of wanting the need to always have a pacifier, the one way that i've heard and experienced with other people is if you keep cutting down the nipple bit by bit each day slowly there will be nothing to nibble on and therefore that might break his habit! Hope this will work!|`|ey4kL9xaaa	We started with hiding the pacifiers so that they weren't visible.  First we only let him have it at night/nap time.  Then we tried with just night time, then taking it out of his bed after he fell asleep.  Keep telling him he doesn't need it.  It might take a little time and crying, but it should work.|`|nkaJ0t5Vaa	in my opinion i say you should probably get the child started on a more healthy habit such as playing with toys or running around outside|`|5433c9903fcc324cd325c611d35beda1aa	Don't be fooled into thinking that he will grow out of it. The longer you wait to take it away permanently the harder it will be. I know 9 year olds that still take a blankie with them and sneak into their parents room at night. Yes screaming for 3 hours is normal, but it will get easier every night. Just stick to your guns, don't give in. It may be easier to not even have any pacifiers or bottles in the house at all. Because as strong as we all may think we are its a different story when our child is screaming and you know all you have to do is give in and it will stop. Good luck whatever you decide.|`|F4XaPnXHaa	Hi, my daughter had a pacifer until she was 2 and a half, but was i really worried when i wanted to take it away from her.  I made her believe she was helping poorly babies in hospital that do not have pacifiers and that the fairies would take them away and leave her a gift.(she left them in the garden, once asleep i put in the bottom of my bin) She gave them away without any problem, first night was a bit difficult but we have not looked back since.  Hope this helps|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	just throw the bottles, nipples, pacifiers all away.  He may be a pain in the butt for a couple days, but he will get over it....|`|QzWHMGHJaa	Just throw them all out and he'll deal with it.  Anything else will just prolong the inevitable!  He'll be over it in a few days!
ZbnxGIsnaa	What it is: Vaginal spotting and vaginal bleeding are two different things. Heres how to tell them apart: If what you see is bright red, consider it bleeding; if its brown or pink, thats spotting. The amount of blood you see is another red flag: Spotting doesnt soak a sanitary napkin; bleeding may.     What causes it: In the earliest part of pregnancy, light spotting right around the time youd expect your period (or a little beforehand) is usually a sign that an embryo has implanted itself into the uterine wall. (Thats good!) Spotting after intercourse is often the result of the increased sensitivity of your cervix to any kind of minor bumping or irritation. (Some 20 percent of all pregnant women will have some spotting during their first trimester; after that, spotting is less likely to occur, and even if it does, its still not necessarily an ominous sign.) Later in pregnancy, blood-streaked mucus may indicate the loss of your mucous plug or the beginnings of labor.     Definitely sounds like implantation spotting.  I had spotting with my son and it definitely sounds like you may be pregnant.  Normally, with my periods they are excruciating with bleeding and when I was spotting it was light to moderate and no cramps.  Hope this helps!  =)|`|sxImRCT5aa	well i havent|`|9gHVoof2aa	i havnt had this myself but implantation bleeding should be nomore than a teaspoon of blood a day|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	wow that sounds very liely to me :D exactly textbook implantation...    good luck|`|BaXruEcqaa	could be, only a small percentage of women experience implantation bleeding.  I though I had it last month but it turned out to be my period coming very early.|`|rmse6Mj8aa	if you have implantation spotting (which is rare - it happens to 20% of pregnant women) it should last one day and be extremely light. on fertilityfriend and twoweekwait.com women describe it as brownish or pinkish and 'only when i wipe'.    implantation spotting is also due to occur 6-12 dpo so this might be a little late?    if this isnt implantation spotting it might just be the start of your period - i had 2 days of very light caramel brownish spotting in in my cm last month 2 days before my period came, as it was late.    i really hope you are going to get a bfp though as it is possible to have spotting and go on to get a bfp. good luck|`|VEEbzc4jaa	I cant really remember, then again i wasnt looking for any sign or symptom.     Just wait till ya periods due and see if it comes or not..........if it doesnt take a test!|`|0bWABcxeaa	I had this too this month.  I spotted, very light for three days, then didn't spot at all the next day, then came on the day after that.  I have only been on a day and then stopped.      I had started taking B6 tablets earlier this month to prolong my luteal phase as it was very short and am attributing the spotting to that.    I would just advise you not to get your hopes up because it is devastating when AF comes!    Good luck tho x|`|AgmychHqaa	I have had this from wk 4 to wk 8.|`|XwjjKkPCaa	I had implantation bleeding from week 5 to week 7 the midwife confirmed it was implantation bleeding but i found this very confusing as i thought implantation was sooner than that, well there ya go i suppose everyones different, mine was brown/black and didnt have a lot just spots!    Good luck i hope you are pregnant :)|`|6riOjtxYaa	So far no, got my bfp a week ago.  I suppose it would have happened by now.  So no did not get any bleeding but loads of white/ very very pale brown discharges. Hope this helps.
C55pji5Qaa	Well. I think I am in the minority. After ttc for two years my husband I sought a RE. He was perfectly healthy. I had Endo and Mild ovulatory dysfunction. After my lap, we tried Clomid 50mg from days 3-7. I started my period 2 1/2 weeks later. I went in for an ultrasound and I had developed 8 very large cysts on both of my ovaries. It had made the follicles grow but I still did not ovulate. At that point we decided to do IVF because with IUI we could not be sure that I would ovulate. It was very uncomfortable and that is one of the possible side effects but it is not a common one. I would have been scared to go up more for the risk of cysts, but that is normal protocol. That is usually what doctors will do. I will listen to your doctor but I agree that upping the dose may be a bad idea in your situation but I am not an expert. Are you seeing a RE or OB-GYN?Good luck|`|3aV4lcCqaa	hi hon, AF came today for me! i am snowed in at home so cant go to work hence being online now at home...    anyway you already know that i am being referred for IVF, the referral letter was sent out to roehampton hospital last week and the waiting list is 5-6 months (all on NHS).    i dont think they would put it up to 100mg.    i have some spare pills left so i might take another cycle of clomid although i shouldnt really    xxxx|`|KlJHZRSiaa	I got pregnant on the first month of Clomid 100mg. So perhaps a raise in dose would be good for you. But watch out -- you'll sleep for the whole 5 days!
xpstigPTaa	I was in the same exact situation as you and this month is my first cycle of Clomid. AF is not due until the 15th so I have a while to wait but I have heard mixed stories. I have heard some people fall pregnant the first time, 2nd time and 3rd time and then there are some that it just doesn't work for them. I guess it is case by case but I hope it works for the both of us! I think you should talk to your doctor about the next steps in conceiving and let him/her know that you would like to try Clomid. If it is a good doctor, they will respect your wishes and support you. My doctor suggested Clomid to me...I wish you the best of luck and truck loads of baby dust to you!!!!!!!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	talk to ur doctor

Jo2DfRzaaa	yup.  even when daddy is home its still mommy!  heck even he does it - mom they aren't listening to me!<br>  i used to wonder why my mom used to say Ive changed my name and i'm not telling anyone what it is.  she also used to say she was going crazy and never coming back.  i get those things now.<br>  you could also be nunya - nunya business.<br>  :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  edit - you could totally tunnel those hearts if you would get your butt moving on inventing it.|`|T8CR3u02aa	Eeeekkkk.I will be at that stage soon.

yp9rEMSraa	Yes there is....every other day is what most people say to do when TTC.....The sperm will live in the body for a few days....it is likely that you could have conceived but you are going to have to wait and see!! Best of luck|`|vigFmfLmaa	Yes, there's a chance.  You should know in 2 weeks.  Good luck.
qYZ2QFlbaa	I wouldn't be mad, I'd be concerned. It's not just about the grade, perhaps the work is just too advanced for you? Perhaps ask for a tutor, or maybe you can stay after school, getting extra help from the teacher?|`|1KIwM1uOaa	All I expect out of my kids is that they do their best.  If they have done all they can do and still have a low grade then I don't like it but I accept it, however if they could have done more and didn't then yes I am upset.<br>  <br>  Do your parents know you are struggling with math?  Have you asked them and the teacher for help?  Have you practiced and studied?  If the answer is yes then you did all you could if it is no then it isn't to late to start asking.|`|9CK62mixaa	I wouldn't be mad at them. I would be mad at myself for being an irresponsible parent. However, low grades can be a sign something is up.|`|chfILbonaa	I think if you tried and they knew how hard you tried they wouldnt punish you I have never gotten grounded or anything for grades|`|AA11537580	if they studied and tried their very best and still got a low mark then no i wouldn't be angry<br>  if they didn't study and didn't even really try then I would be angry|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	No, not at all. Having a below average grade in math when I was in school, I am highly understanding of that. It wouldn't bother me in the slightest.|`|rdUKSiIxaa	If you really try and study...and then you had bad grade...I wouldn't be mad.|`|3w7VztEWaa	no|`|bdWO9wSAaa	I'm currently a straight A student, but I used to never even bother with the work and settle for Cs and Ds, every once in a while an F.<br>  <br>  My mom said as long as I'm trying, she doesn't care. She always used to tell me, "Grades don't count til high school."<br>  <br>  And it's true =P|`|jdRKZe18aa	I have always expected my 4 kids to do THEIR BEST and at times their best has been LESS than A's or B's.  I only got mad when I KNEW they were failing due to their irresponsibility or failure to do, try and be their best and give it their BEST effort with assignments, homework etc.<br>  <br>  As they grew older I let it be more and more their problem if they weren't doing well in school.  As kids grow up they want less & less opinions & help from parents.  SO, if they don't want to do their best and feel GOOD about themselves and their achievements and academic standing in school - then THEY ultimately have to live with it.  I can only nag, complain and get upset SO long and SO much and then it isn't worth it to my mental health either! : )   PLUS I know that we all have subjects that we do WELL IN and easily achieve in those areas and we have other classes that are just tough and not our BEST AREA.  Getting D & F's though were NEVER ACCEPTABLE in our household.   D's & F's mean NOT TRYING or even attempting to pass a class.  SO as long as they gave it their BEST EFFORT and got C's and above - I was ok with that.  BUT I always wanted them to keep me INFORMED if I was to expect a progress report or report card that was something I should be forewarned about!!!|`|X6as2nOAaa	If my daughter tried her best and studied and did what she could I would not be mad at all.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	if you really did study but just maybe didnt understand the matter then no I wouldnt be mad. I would try to get you into tutoring or something though to help you with the subject. <br>  I had d's in math several times and sometimes I tried and others I didnt. <br>  I wouldnt be mad as in ' i'm going to ground you  and take away your computer etc'  but I would like you to try to do better in the future|`|a8IRxC4raa	I would not be angry in the slightest.  Grades are essentially meaningless.  It's the learning that counts.  If my child did her best and still received a poor grade, I would find out what was making learning difficult and correct the situation.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|AA12221392	Not if I knew that they gave it there all. That is all i can ask of them.<br>  <br>  If they dont try then that is a different story. <br>  <br>  I teach my kids to be the best they can be.|`|sxecXFgraa	If they actually tried their best and still failed, no I wouldn't be mad.  They would be getting a tutor for the subject.

q4ppgGe1aa	I think they're all great names so it's hard to decide.<br>  <br>  I think Alexa Jane flows better than Ava Rae (which could be misheard as "Avery").

Hope this helped and best wishes =)|`|zSABr7praa	I worked at a daycare before my husband and I moved, Ava and Isabelle/a are very popular right now...might not be the best choice if you want something "unique".  I like Alexa Rae, actually.  I also LOVE the name Owen Cole.  Owen was in the running for us if we had a boy!  Buuut we're expecting a girl, Aubrielle :)|`|IlSALGKMaa	Ava Rae and Luke Cole. xD Sorry, mixed them up a bit. If I must choose one, though, I would say Luke Ryan.|`|cErLq7f3aa	Alexa Jane<br>  Owen Cole|`|xLabGD6Maa	Alexa Jane<br>  Owen Cole|`|e4M4uQXNaa	This is kind of a hard choice for me lol.<br>  <br>  Ava and Alexa are both really pretty, strong names.  I think I'm going to go for Alexa Jane though.  It has a cute balance of modern, fun Alexa and more classic Jane. <br>  <br>  Same goes for Luke and Owen!  I absolutely love both names, and either would be a great choice.  Both sound like sweet, kind but still very masculine and strong boys.  Even though I prefer the middle name Cole, Luke is still my favorite, so I'm voting Luke Ryan lol.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Alexa Rae<br>  Owen Ryan|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Alexa Jane<br>  Luke Ryan.|`|pHIUUnOiaa	Alexa Jane<br>  Luke Ryan|`|BL4qe0aCaa	Ava Rae<br>  Luke Ryan|`|T7uFoSUQaa	Alexa Jane and Luke Ryan|`|y1BNwoJyaa	Ava Rae and Owen Cole|`|GRY78ihRaa	Personally I like  Alexa Rae and Ryan Cole.

prqrQcd1aa	I'm not going to say my own opinion as you are probably looking towards more legal answers.. The answer is NO, at least in PA the answer is NO... some other states it may be different. Now.. Say the mother is 16 and the father has just turned 18, she can not apply for child support because she is still a minor, in my state.. the parents would have to apply for child support in behalf of the daughter/grandchild.|`|YAwvszITaa	depending on what state you are i the childs parents could become responsible for paying child support if the child is not working. Regardless if he has gotten a girl pregnant under 18 is still a kid. Not to say that he does not need to man up and take care of his responsibilities himself.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Even if he is under the age of 18 and has got a girl pregnant, he is not a kid, he is a MAN and needs to support his child.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't have a job, he needs to get one, and he also needs to be more careful in the future and protect himself and his partner from unwanted babies.|`|NUS7MIVRaa	In my opinion, yes, the child is responsible for child support.  If they don't have a job, they need to get one.  It would be nice if the parents would help their child and future grand-child in any way that they could.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	You might want to check with the state regulations.  It's possible ANY person who is the biological father regard less of age would be responsible.|`|AA10529334	No the parent is not responsible for the child support the boy is.|`|56MmKc5caa	What age are you talking about? If both guy and gal are under 18? Or if One is 18 and the other is younger? This question is a little vaugue. Personally I would think that they are not responsible if under 18 but if they were a good person they would want to help out and get a job. The parent of the guy kid who got girl pregnant would not be responsible for anything.|`|TLjNUJHLaa	No matter how old the "kid" is he is responsible as long as he is the father. If he doesn't have a job to pay child support then the courts will throw the "kid" in jail.

WPI0Z47saa	Could be a smaller baby or you could be in better shape especially if you are running around after two other ones lol. Maybe your abs were tighter this time and it would take you longer to show in that case.

By the time i'm 18 weeks i'll probablly look like im atleast 6 months haha. <br>  <br>  Well this baby could be smaller and might explain why you're smaller. <br>  Maybe since its the third pregnancy you've watched what to eat during pregnancy and have kept your weight gain at minimum and don't look as big as the previous two?<br>  Have you tried asking your ob or midwife?<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll get that cute tummy, good luck!|`|ckgiPMm4aa	Your uterus shrinks after you have the baby, but not all the way, so after each baby, it stays a little bit bigger, and of course every pregnancy if different.|`|78FXygtoaa	every pregnancty is different.<br>  i didnt show until 6 months.|`|OFSeDjbnaa	Its all very different.<br>   I am on my first pregnancy and I was really surprised how long it took for me to show. I am in week 22 now, and I really only started to get sort of a belly in week 20. I was scaring myself looking at pregnancy galleries where some women looked like they were about to give birth and they were only in week 14! The baby was normal and expected size at the 20 week UL too.|`|b07c5ab23b5694bf2e87027fecc000efaa	All pregnancies are different and you carry every baby different.  Maybe the baby is smaller too?? About a year after I had twins, I was about 6 months pregnant with my youngest daughter, and nobody at work could even tell I was pregnant.  I think  I just looked, idk, puffy or something.  If it really worries you, talk to your doc.

26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	Honestly I do not think it is going to hurt your wife's health.  I do think it is going to hurt your son's mental health and at the very least his own sense of "self".  I have 4 children and two step sons.  One of my boys is 9.  I breastfed all my kids but stopped when they started to get teeth.  It also made my husband uncomfortable and I respected and agreed with him that around 6-9 months is it.  But, this was our personal decision.  My question to you is, "How do you feel about it?"  Does she do it around any of his friends or is there any way that his friends at school know?  Kids can be cruel at that age even when a boy is athletic and popular.  I can't imagine how my boys school (the 4th graders) about a classmate still breastfeeding.  You do realize that the girls are already having the "birds and the bees" video and boys do in 5th grade.  I am not judging, even though I can't imagine!, but it needs to be discussed between you and your wife and perhaps even your son in family therapy.  I really worry about your relationship with your wife and your poor son if any classmates or peers find out.  Good luck.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	at 9 id be more worried about the affect on my son!!  u cant be serious|`|1r05fktRaa	9 old to breastfeeds|`|fPJTZwoUaa	r u sure u havent been watching too much - Little Britain  - and i want bitty - if u havent then  maybe u need to see if u can find it  especially the serieds when they went to america  -        sorry if u feel that ppl are giving u a hard time about it  - its just that in westren culture it seems a bit extreme but there are ppl who think this is quite ok  - but   by most standards extended  breasfeeding is seen as something outside the norms -    ok   have u tried to talk to ur wife  about it does she want to give up bf and does she see it as something to feel uncomfortable about   Does ur son have some sort of  seperation anxiety ?  If she doesnt want to bf him anymore she has to say no -   and she has to be firm about it  How do u feel about it ? Have u told her how u feel about it   Some research into extended breastfeeding may help u too   - goodluck  i cant see why it would be unhealthy for her body in non western cultures mothers and grandmothers sometines share the responsibility of feeding the babies - but thatbecause they are malnourished and the baby wont survive otherwise|`|veO1RXrCaa	You are obviously a troll.  Look dude turn off the computer and go find something else to do with your creative writing class diploma.  This is boring.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	um, that's not good for your son. 3 years is the oldest you should breast feed. When is she planning to stop? when he's 19? You should seriously talk to both her and your doctor about this. He can tell you the real facts. I'm completely against breast feeding after the age of 2.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	I don't know the medical repercussions and such, but your son will need psychotherapy in his adult years.    Health-wise, I don't think your wife is at risk anymore than if she was cranking out babies 3 times every 2 years.    I'd be concerned about your son's teeth too.  Yes, it is his first set, but buck teeth seem to be in his future.|`|AA11503426	Bitty mummy!|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Disturbing....................    On a serious note all your wife has to do is simply refuse to breast feed pretty simple i guess...............|`|jC1Mdsefaa	I would say that I can understand the bond him and his mother have.  But she should have cut him off no later than 2 years old.  I can also understand if he likes the milk and cant do with out, to pump it out.  Have you suggested this to her?  She should not have him on her breast anymore.  Does he have any mental situation?  That maybe why he wants to stay with mom.  But he is in 4th grade at least by now.  I bet it would be awkward for you huh!|`|9oTQpf3daa	if you are being serious, this is some thing that has to be stopped as soon as possible, i would suggest your wife expresses her milk into a cup and gives it to him, chances are he will not like this as it is a comfort thing, and also your wife will probably find it hard to stop as well,but by giving it in a cup it will make both parties aware that its not actually the milk he likes but the actually act of being close to his mother, and once they both realise this, it should make them both want to stop, if it doesn't then they both need counselling or something, also to be very honest with you i can see how a few people may see that as inappropriate and in some ways child abuse. so please try to stop it now. get a breast pump and ONLY give him milk from a cup.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Thanks troll|`|aSKsDtwLaa	The physical health of either does not concern me at all.    The mental health of BOTH of them does.    Your wife has an over-attachment to the child - which at 9 years old may be considered child abuse/molestation.  This boy is closer to puberty than to birth at this age.  The idea that she is indulging a child in anything just because he wants it is also very wrong.      We must all grow, change, adapt in order to become normal adults.  There must be boundaries and limits, everyone needs to hear the word no - and get used to it.    The idea that he "can't" be weened is nonsense.  As the adult, your wife is responsible for ending this.  If she can't or won't, then you need to insist.      You may have to get a mental health professional involved.  I hope it does not also require legal action.  Your first priority must be the child's future, your wife made the choice for him, and must be stopped.|`|6DWJAaSeaa	i would say your wife seriously needs help and i feel sorry for your son, if i knew her personally, i would prolly report her|`|hQHWVRyTaa	OMG...your wife needs a SERIOUS intervention. There must be something wrong with her to continue to do this. Any normal parent would have stopped this at or before the age of 2.    Your son will obviously need some sort of psychiatric counseling as well.|`|JxVx0GXiaa	i suspect this question is a joke.    however, if it's not, have the future mental effects on the child been thought out??|`|dU4IPBO0aa	Your wife has definately crossed the line from breastfeeding over into dating!  That is sick and wrong!|`|J1stiMioaa	if you really want it to stop, ring the police. at 9 years old im sure this would actually be classed as sexual abuse|`|99ML0m2yaa	That's kind of strange...I would never breastfeed for that long...the kid can deal with not getting my milk and drink cow milk.  Anyway...as long as she is using the like her body will keep producing it.  I'm sure this will take a toll on her body eventually though!  Especially if she is not eating right and getting all the vitamins and minerals her body needs.|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	Even though I don't know if I believe your question 100%, I'm going to answer you as if I did.     It is natural for your wife to still be producing milk. If she's still having a child suckling from her, she will continue to produce. This is what wet nurses do. They make sure they continue to produce milk.     I mean this in no disrespect, but you really need to have your son and your wife in therapy. Breast feeding a child of nine years old is not healthy and he will develop a very unhealthy attachment to his mother. Sadly, he probably already has.     It's a very weird and honestly, gross situation. I would hope that she doesn't feed him in public.     He is 9 years old. Do you realize that he is only four years away from being a teen? You need to put your foot down and stop this immediately. It's not unhealthy in the physical sense - but it's extremely unhealthy as far as his mental health goes.     Once you do get him off the breast, her milk will eventually dry up. If not, have her see a doctor. There are always programs for mothers who continue to produce breast milk where they are able to donate it to starving children. And I'm serious about that.
h57t7FAjaa	I like Ainsley... it's very pretty!<br>  <br>  They are both nice names, but I think Ainsley will age very well.  It's cute for a little girl but can also sound very grown up and professional.  I think Mackenzie is adorable for a little girl, but doesn't sound as nice for an older woman.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and good luck with your decision!!|`|pVdV4gwgaa	Ainsley sounds somewhat  exotic.

sxecXFgraa	Some of the shows are OK and some get on my nerves.  Suite Life is OK until London is in the scene and I can take Hanna Montana is small doses.

I allow my kids to watch Disney Channel when they watch t.v. Which isn't very often. They like movies better. Although the movies that they watch are made by Disney. My daughter loves all the Princess movies and my son LOVES Cars. My 3 month old will calm down and pay attention when we put on Finding Nemo. I think it has to do with all the bright colors. Although I agree with Joseph the Second. I would rather have my children playing outside then sitting in front of the T.V. I only allow them one movie a day and maybe an hour of t.v if that.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Well, it's better than them watching Jerry Springer (although PERSONALLY, I prefer my Kids to be playing Outside as much as possible. The fresh air & exercise keeps them in "shape", & helps them sleep better at night!) !   :)|`|yacLHWqEaa	Well i know this is for parents but I think its a great channel. I used to watch it all the time|`|H6cvTuBCaa	My son watches the Disney Channel everyday. Little Einsteins, Tigger and Pooh, Handy Manny, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Imagination Movers, etc... I love it. It teaches them all kinds of things...numbers, letters, behavioral characteristics, sounds, colors, shapes, etc. <br>  Actually, if you go to their website, Disney has an at home preschool program that you can install onto your computer. It has a 7 day free trial and after that you can get a year for $49.95. I just signed my son up for it and he loves it and it really teaches him the things to get him ready for Kindegarten. Good Luck and by the way, I don't know how old your child is but mine is 3 and going to be 4 in September. I've listed the website to the Playhouse Disney Preschool in sources. Once again, Good Luck!|`|8SjoUQmEaa	I think it's fine in moderation. I don't like the fact that it's targeted for 6-11 year olds and every show pretty much tells kids that they have to be pretty and popular and have boyfriends. No wonder 4th graders have cliques and are "dating" each other.|`|1acc6a03dc8acb93ccd9b56b409139d2aa	I think disney channel is a good channel but some of the shows on later deal with children in highschool or middle school.. so if i have a young child i would definitly make them watch treehouse more then family channel.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	I'm with Irene on this.  It's okay in moderation...but some of the shows feature very shallow outlooks on life & that makes me worry about how my daughter is looking at things.|`|eNulfbs7aa	My children watch disney all the time. I enjoy it to. It is an amazing channel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xMy0QEvFaa	I'm not really a fan of Disney channel myself, but I wouldn't mind my son watching it.|`|uBAP6sqzaa	I think it's fine, my kids watch it all the time.|`|BYw0LXguaa	i often watch with them|`|lN0GkKgaaa	My daughter is only a toddler . . but she likes some of the Playhouse Disney shows on that channel. She learns a lot from them.<br>  <br>  Some of the disney shows that is geared to the older kids, are kinda cute but some of them I really do not like. <br>  <br>  I think the only major problem I have with disney and nick type shows is that there is always a ridiculously dumb person in each show. That is the only one that really stands out to me and bugs me. But regardless if my daughter enjoys the shows when she is older she is welcome to watch them. . (but we usually watch tv in the early mornings while first waking up, and just before bed)|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	I'm fine with them watching it, but we don't really watch too much t.v. We're freaks that actually do stuff. I don't like disney channel I think all the mini super stars on there were sold by their parents to the disney channel who in turn exposes their talents for lots and lots of money.|`|Ev9UpLNvaa	I like some of the stuff on there and my 2 yr old enjoys it. I only really let him watch stuff that he learns well from like Micky mouse club house and Little Einstiens. He has learned alot of vocabulary and manners from those two shows, also counting (letters and numbers!)|`|UxhzluZnaa	i love the disney channel half the time id be sitting there watching it without my kids but it was a channel they were always welcome to|`|uKJUKs8Naa	Disney channel is fine.

vygYFdsSaa	Aww I'm sorry to hear about your previous miscarriages. Hopefully the fourth time will be the charm. I don't think you should be worried about the darkness of the line. Good luck I hope you have a safe and healthy pregnancy.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	A line is a line, no matter how faint. Don't overanalyze the irregular cycle. Just let your doctor know you're pregnant ASAP so they can get you early care due to your previous miscarriages.<br>  <br>  Congrats and best of luck to you.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Congratulations mama!  It doesn't matter how faint it is...a positive is a positive!!!  I took at least 3 tests because they were "faint" and at the end of the day I'm preggers.  Don't stress, be happy!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It just means that you aren't that far along. Take another one in about a week and it will be a lot darker. I took a test when i was 3 weeks pregnant and it was so faint that you could barely see it. Just be stay positive and just call your doctor and set up a prenatal appointment. Just tell them that you don't know when your last period was so you can try to get in there a little earlier because they usually won't see you until you're around 8 weeks or so. Plus, if you tell them that then you can usually get an ultrasound done to check to see how far along you are. Good luck and congrats! Don't worry everything will be fine!|`|tu7aqUoxaa	pray to God and have faith, everything will be alright|`|wKuQC4yTaa	Even if it's faint it's still a positive. Congrats! I hope this one goes better for you|`|e4apiusoaa	You are pregnant and you should call your OB to make an appointment. The line is light because You re very early in the pregnancy. If you wait a few more days it will be darker, it has to do with at amount of hormone in your body, forgot the name, I think HGC?<br>  Anyway, seek medical attention now. Take care of yourself, rest, and think positive..|`|rSCeB6T6aa	I had a similar experience with the lines on the tests.  I ended up getting a read out test that says pregnant/not pregnant.  It confirmed that i was pregnant.  Made me feel a whole lot better, and i got to the dr asap :-)  Good luck!|`|euN3ct9oaa	Mine was the same way- the line was really light. I haven't had any miscarriages. Just get to the OB/GYN as soon as you can and maybe you'll have better luck this time around. I wish you luck!|`|A4ETov2Qaa	do what i did and get the digital kind of pregnancy test, either yes or no, no confusing lines to figure out.  A blood test is a sure thing too|`|ce8COixxaa	If you take a digital test it will show you for sure, then call your doctor!

She will always be associated with Spiderman's Mary Jane and the shoes Mary-Janes. The hypen is unnecessary, pointless, and stupid.|`|TrBoPj92aa	mary is very engish and jane is very english but put together it reminds me of mary-kate olsen and for that reason i think its sounds very americam and i agree with the hillbilly-ish! ( about the name not the country)x|`|WIEPISyeaa	I'm not british, but I think quite the contrary.  Mary-Jane is not a "hillbilly" name at all....I would actually have said it seemed kind of uppedy.....|`|AXEp1Bu6aa	No, because Mary and Jane are both traditional, old fashioned english names so they would be perfect for a little english girl.|`|QQhe3NmHaa	I don't know if it's hillbilly, but don't call your baby it , if you are having one, it's horrible.|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	Well, i associate it with Texas, white picket fence etc. But my names no better (Hannah Jane)|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Well, in the USA MARY JANE is another word for pot or marijuana.|`|PDffAFf3aa	No it sounds pretty, and of course she could always shorten it to Mary which is a nice name  x|`|1iOsKZvIaa	Hillbilly?!?! LMAO!<br>  It is a bit American.|`|ZkNZuGN8aa	ALLL TEH YANKEE'S R HILLYBILLYS, TEH GET TEH SHOTGUNZ AND PWNS YOW! DONT NAME IT MARY JANE! NAME IT PWNAGE ENGLISH NAMNE!

But it's American slang for weed. I should know, because I'm American.|`|697EHXNeaa	I think Mary-Jane is British|`|DacTCJVKaa	I live in England and my friend's name is Mary-Jane, so no|`|SkWQk8s5aa	i hope you know that "Mary-Jane" is slang for weed ..|`|hOEIFpl5aa	this is an offensive message about american's, which i happen to be. and Mary Jane is slang for pot or marijuana. so us hillbilly's would not name our kids that!|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I think Mary-Jane is a really cute name but I wouldnt choose it personally as I dont like either of the names on their own, and you never know how people will shorten names given to your child.
Zq7f1wyYaa	love both of them equal.<br>  <br>  never pick a favorite.<br>  <br>  Your older child wont feel that way, unless you start to not pay any attention to her.  She won't feel as if she isn't loved enough, compared to her other (maybe) sibling, unless you give her a reason to.<br>  <br>  It is quite normal for the older child to be the 'favorite' in most families.|`|inA6ZLeAaa	First of all you should wait, you are too young. I know that you don't feel this way now but most people who get married so young end up divorced. Do you want two kids to raise by yourself and to fight for child support. Right now, you think that will never happen. I was with a guy for 9 years, one weekend, i met another guy, packed up moved out,  and today,  I have been married for 9 years to that wonderful man that I met that weekend. No one would have ever thought I would have left that man I grew with for so long, but one look, one wonderful night is all it took, and we were married 9 months later. Do you have a college degree, a good permanent job, does he? How is he going to support 4 of you? Think long and hard- you are so young and do not hae to get married.

Take out Addison (its a disease that i actually have), McKelle (its weird), Zoey (thats a dogs name), Stella (thats an old chain smoker ladys name), Mckenzie (is a last name) Lynlee (its gay), Oaklynn (sounds like Oakland which is a ghetto city  here in Cali).  Blaire, Calleigh, Kendall, Lucy, are sweet names for girls.

They are pretty gay...no offense.

KNxs4PrZaa	he is really too young for chucke cheese, there are alot of video games and token games that he wont understand and the climbing area will be full of bigger kids who will knock him over,  plus those places are crowded and dirty, there is no reason to take a 20 month old.|`|nT6dNIfBaa	The only bad thing about it.. is that there are kids running around all over the place.. there is a large jungle gym type thing throughout so the kids just run wild. Which causes them to run into each other.. and a 20month old.. may get pushed down or bumped by accident.  he should be okay if you stay with him... The slides and jungle gym are tubes which are very hard for parents to fit in,but there are a lot of games for kids a little older.. like age 5 or 6. So, Im not sure how much he would be able to enjoy.. other than the show Chuck E. and his friends put on. The show is very cute.. but not sure it is worth paying to get in if that's all you will be able to enjoy. Also, if you are someone who likes to have a beer with your pizza... they do not serve beer. Hope all this helps.|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	I highly agree with MNH. I had my son's four year birthday party there. It was a madhouse, and I spent the whole time making sure that he and his friends didn't get bullied by the other kids. I had to actually block some kids from my son and his friends. They were careless and were pushing them out of the way. Oh I have no qualms about moving a child to protect my own.|`|zATQaiwIaa	its to soon|`|QktshEUYaa	No I do not think Chuck E cheeses would be a good place to take your toddler any place that I have been is filthy and nasty, Chuck E' Cheeses is good for toddler entertainment but it is extremely unsanitary, especially the play area with the slides. Some kids don't know any better and might pee or poop in the Jungle Jim. That's my only real concern.|`|2d8879147618190440919438922e8a7eaa	my son first went to chuck e cheese when he was 18 months old.  we enjoyed it, they do have things for the younger kids and my son got a kick out of the stage performances that went on.  i think if it is just him going, you may get bored or he may lose interest easily, but why not try it out and see?  my friend used to yell at me, she think there are hypodermic needles in the ball pit, but my kid shave yet to get stuck, so i have no problem with my kids going.|`|UxhzluZnaa	the shows would be good for him and some of the games would be fun. if you have a larger one they have a ball pit and things he would like. just make sure you hold onto your purse i had my wallet stolen from ours right our of my purse that was in my stroller that was with me! and they dont have security cameras, they do have stamps that match kids to parents so no one but you can leave with your kid but nothing to protect your belongings|`|AA11553579	Most of the games, etc. are geared toward school age kids.  I recently took my 4 year old daughter there for a friend's birthday and she was a bit overwhelmed by all the noise and flashing lights.  She got tired of it pretty quickly and just wanted to go home.|`|X0ul35wQaa	I don't think it's too early, but you might want to wait because its the peak of flu season. He would probably have a blast, but we are also waiting to take our little one because we don't want him sick.|`|vpRERM9jaa	he's too young. take him when he's in the age range of 5-9|`|VwaFM0L8aa	My daughter is 4 I have been taking her there since she was 2 she loves it. Try it out.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Hed love it. they have stuff for him too|`|5bc904f09d573b29371603dab0caa809aa	Funny... I just came from Chuck E Cheese's.. my son had a blast!  He'll turn 3 next month but I have been taking him ever since he was about 20 months.  Your son will like it.. it will give both you & him something to do.  Give it a try.. it won't hurt.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Go late morning/ early afternoon when it's empty.. that's what I do. The school kids that everyone is warning you about won't be there.. they'll be at school.|`|r11JvkUOaa	No, that place is so full of nasty germs! I wasn't allowed to go as a child, and I will not allow my children to go there either. Its disgusting, and parents in general do not watch their children. Yuck.|`|AA12080472	my guess is that he would enjoy it.  but then again i think at that age any event would be fun and exciting as long as he is not sleepy, hungry or just cranky.|`|9o05qM2Saa	he to young if he toddleer

qisy7yuSaa	hi there, im also 15wks 4 days, and i am experiencing the same things as you lol! im not really showing although some evenings i look in the mirror and gosh i see a big difference, this is also my first baby and i hear that for us 1st timers it takes longer for our bumps to show, because our muscles are tight (no offense to any 2nd, 3rd etc mummys lol) a lot of my friends who have recently had babies also say they didnt show until after 20wks (not long for us lol) <br>  <br>  im also feeling, what i hope and think is the baby moving, although its not the kind of feeling i was expecting! hope it is baby though, because its nice to think he/she is dancin around in there lol! xxxx p.s CONGRATS!!! xxx|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	7 months|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I don't remember with my first 2, but this one I woke up one day around 14 weeks and I could tell.|`|AA10458750	I'm 5 months and my belly still looks like I overate at the buffet....lol...not an exact "bump" yet! But, you ask any woman in their third trimester and they will tell you how much they miss the days when they could look down and see their feet =) ! And you will start feeling it more in a couple weeks.|`|IlSALGKMaa	I'm 17 weeks, 4 days. BARELY showing. Really can't tell if it's bloating or if I'm really showing... and sometimes I think I can feel the baby, but it's nothing noticeably for sure.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	congrats! I'm 19 weeks and still don't feel my baby move. He/she is very lazy.I started showing at aout 14-15 weeks|`|Yo2Wn8wUaa	First off, congrats!!<br>  <br>  I first felt him around 16/17 weeks.  I didn't really start showing until 6 months - until then though I just felt fat.  lol|`|A4ETov2Qaa	i am almost 20 weeks and the past two weeks have been such a huge change.  I was carrying a little extra weight around pre-pregnancy so i started to really show around 16 weeks and i have been getting bigger ever since but every woman is different.  I started to feel the baby around 18 weeks, it feels like a weird little flutter down by the pubic bone, kind of like a muscle spasm but once you feel it a couple of times you will be able to recognize it more often.|`|SihmWU0Baa	i am 6 months pregnant and i just started showing <br>  <br>  i didnt feel flutters i started getting kicks round 4.5 months<br>  <br>  so dont worry as long as the doc says everything is ok and fine then i wouldnt worry it just means your keeping your body in shape and your not like the people that sit on the couch and eat and eat|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I didn't start showing til more like 5 months with my first. I'm hoping to show a lot sooner this time around!!<br>  ..you might be feeling your baby! I didn't til 22 weeks, and I tried hard to pay constant attention, but once I did start feeling movement he had moved past flutters and was full on kicking :-) Again, I'm hoping to feel movement earlier this time!! Congrats :-)|`|imIiuaAAaa	Congrats! =]<br>  <br>  I started getting a baby belly at 14 weeks, and am pretty sure I've been feeling bean move since about 15 weeks. It varies from woman to woman, so if you're not showing yet, hang in there! It'll come ;]|`|Khs7HBYmaa	I STARTED FEELING MY BABY ABOUT THE FOURTH MONTH.  AND I SHOWED AT ABOUT SIX MONTHS.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	6.5 months. or 26 weeks. <br>  <br>  This is me at 8 months or around 32 to 35 weeks. (can't remember for sure what week)|`|HQ5R1p9qaa	started feeling her at i think 4 months and started really showing around almost the sixth month|`|WaoGiPHIaa	it starting becoming obvious to others that i was pregnant when i was about 6.5 months pregnant. <br>  before then my father thought i was getting fat.<br>  my husband noticed around month 3.
RqY7HA9eaa	All of the names are beautiful, <br>  and middle names aren't commonly used so it shouldn't make that big of a difference.. I agree that the name Mona is cute :)|`|y1BNwoJyaa	1. don't like<br>  2. I like Victoria but not Jean<br>  3. really don't like<br>  4. cute<br>  5. I think it's pretty, although I think it's a good idea to make Mona the middle name - you're right, it could be a source of teasing.|`|Ga5Wcaj5aa	Jocelyn Melrose.I love that name.It's unique and olden at the same time.Very good choices though.Any would do.|`|BjDJfagmaa	MY FAVS ARE JOCELYN AND VICTORIA|`|r8ST3cFIaa	1) I like Vera a lot. Unique. I also love the name Rae for a girl, or Ray for a boy. <br>  2) I like the name Victoria a lot, not sure about Jean though. <br>  3) I like Melrose as a middle name. <br>  4) I like Kennedy. <br>  5) I like Jacqueline. I also like Jackie a little too. Mona is a nice name, don't be worried about kids making fun of it because if you like that's all that matters. =)|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I only like Vera.<br>  <br>  the rest are horrible I am sorry.|`|w5y4BTjkaa	All those names are beautiful and I think I like Mona the best!<br>  How about just naming her Monalisa Hawthorne or Mona Lisa Hawthowrne! You're right, it is beautiful and artistic! My second fave is Jocelyn Melrose Hawthrone! It flows so beautifully and I love the name Melrose. It sounds so perfect! The name sounds like it would belong to someone who is sweet and kind. The name sounds like the person would accomplish great things in her life and become successful. It sounds like she will be mannerable and well-loved by those around her! Over all, great choices! Hope I helped!|`|VcFAjLCNaa	I imagine you are American.<br>  <br>  Americans always make a big fuss about middle names, which of course are never used.<br>  <br>  So you have to think of someone called Vera Hawthorne, or Jocelyn Hawthorne.<br>  <br>  And apart from Victoria, all the names are a bit rubbish.|`|HUQQzph2aa	Victoria Jean is beatiful. I also like Jacqueline, but not Mona.<br>  Vera and Kennedy are nice, but not something I would choose.|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I like Jaqueline Mona Hawthorne
wWyChyYiaa	if she only had her period for one day...it could have been her tubes closing off.  I would not take (waste) another test just yet.  I would tell her to take another test in 2 weeks.  That will give her body enough time to register the test positive if she is pregnant (even with all the claims of pregnancy tests being able to tell you earlier...your body needs to adjust to the hormone levels).  If it comes out negative again she is most likely not pregnant.  If she is late for her period (after another 2 weeks) then I would test again and see if there are different results.<br>  <br>  If she wants to immediately, she can go to her doctor or local clinic and they can do a blood test and she will know instantly.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|9osFXKPyaa	i think she should definately test agin in a week

4szKHHtJaa	semi-sitting it very common (45-60 degree angle); ask that they not place place you on your back because it inhibits gravity/baby's descent as well as decreasing oxygen to the baby. A very common position is that you may have your legs pulled up towards your body to allow more room, but be careful with this because not having sensation it would be easy for a gung-ho support person to pull too far and pull something. Another option, if your provider will allow it is to semi-sit and have a support person hold the end of a bed sheet while you pull on the other end during a contraction. (Have them wrap around their waist so that they will have support). A lot of women have reported that this is very helpful and helps them to bear down properly instead of expending energy pushing in an incorrect manner. Some providers are more comfortable with this approach than others, so disucss in advance with your provider if there are reasons he or she would not want to use a certain position.|`|TLjNUJHLaa	When I had my baby I was on my back, With the epidural I till felt pressure whenever I was having a contraction and I defiantly felt it when I pushed him out. I had him at 3:27 am and the nurse wanted me to get up and walk by 6 am, but i didn't because my left leg was numb.|`|MqFeJiukaa	When you have an epidural you are bed ridden so you can be on your side but most likely on your back.  I have had 2 epidurals and both times I was on my back while my mom and husband held up my legs, I had to be left on monitors and Ivs and bed ridden.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	With my first child, the epidural didn't work and I felt everything.  With my second child, it worked, but only on the right side of my body.  The left side of my body felt everything.  A very weird experience.  I was not on my side though, I was on my back for delivery both times.  And yes, I was bedridden, but it was so close to the actual birth anyway, that it didn't matter, I would've been bedridden for the remainder regardless.  And since they didn't work completely anyway, I was not bedridden for long after the delivery.
gkdZTuJ6aa	it depends on how far along you are in your pregnancy if you are only a few weeks pregnant it will all come out naturally but after you have been pregnant for a while you do need to go get the baby removed. in some cases the baby is so big they will induce labor and u have to give birth to the miscarried baby. and no it shouldnt get bigger if it was miscarried|`|plI0WOrUaa	It depends on how far along you are whether or not you have to "have it removed"  Women that are farther along have to have a D&C to remove the fetus and placenta from the uterus.  If it is not removed, it cannot grow and get bigger because it is not alive.  Earlier on in pregnancy, like the first 4-8 weeks, sometimes the fetus will discharge from the body completely.|`|lSiv5PDlaa	if theres something in you or whoevers uterus YOU NEED TO GET CHECKED WHETHER YOU THINK IT COMPLETELY EXPELLED ITSELF OR NOT , IT COULD DECAY AND CAUSE THE NEED FOR A HYSTERECTOMY,meaning your "lady parts" are then removed and no kids ever, not as fun as it sounds...IT COULD ALSO CAUSE SEVERE SICKNESS or DEATH<br>  GO TO A GYNO ASAP OR ANY DOC FOR THAT MATTER AND DONT BE ASHAMED TO ASK QUESTIONS THEN IF ITS FOR YOUR WELL BEING, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EMBARASSMENT,THERES NO STUPID QUESTIONS...<br>  <br>  I HOPE I SOMEWHAT HELPED AND PLEASE YOU OR WHOEVER THATS NOTHING TO WAIT AND PLAY WITH THERES A CHANCE IT WONT EXPELL ITSELF AS WITH A PERSON WHOSE PREGNANCY WENT FULL-TERM AND DOESNT/DIDNT EXPELL THE PLACENTA OR CONTRACT AND NEEDS PITOCIN...|`|MFI0V2GBaa	Its most likely to leave the body itself, if it's far enough along. It happened to a friend of mine.<br>  <br>  If it's not very far along, it can kinda just go away itself. <br>  <br>  If it didnt, it's not going to grow any more obviously, because it's not living anymore.<br>  <br>  But if it didn't come out for some reason, it'd be very smart to go to you're doctors and have them take a look.|`|vTra7n5baa	A miscarriage is simply when a woman cannot carry the baby to term because of various physical or biological issues.  As a result, the baby dies and is expunged from the body.  It is completely dead and cannot regenerate certain parts to survive.  This often happens in the mid-early stages of pregnancy.  Any miscarriage requires medical attention immediately to stop any bleeding or residual problems from the experience.|`|SihmWU0Baa	i had a mis carrige in may and it flushed out naturlay <br>  <br>  it wont grow or anything it would give you a very nasty infection and then you would have to have it surgicly removed and its yucky and i heard its painfull<br>  <br>  i misscarried in may 08 got pregnant in august 08 they were scared something would go wrong with my uterus lining being weak this close after a miscarriage but my baby boy is due in may09 the same day i miss carried a year ago on.....<br>  <br>  very ironic|`|JRXpYW3Naa	All the situations are possible. I had to have something called a D&C because my body didn't expel the placenta and it just kept growing. Though usually your body will get rid of it naturally.<br>  (Baby died at seven weeks, and the placenta and everything measured 15 weeks when I had it removed at 15 weeks)|`|Di7KqbVQaa	It doesnt always leave the body straightaway. Sometimes you need to have a D & C/ evacuation to remove the fetus. <br>  <br>  A sac can grow to a point when the fetus has died, but not much.<br>  <br>  If its not removed, you can contract infetions and may be life threatning.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	You need to get it removed to make sure everything came out...  And no it will not still grow.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	yes, you need to be checked to make sure everything has come out. it could lead to a serious infection if you don't. see the doc asap|`|MqFeJiukaa	If you are lucky everything will come out on its own but it really depends.  When I had a miscarriage I was lucky enough to have the Dr be able to "scrape" everything out with out performing a d&c.  Its important to have a Dr do an exam and check because you can get an infection if something does not get expelled.|`|xPR7g0wFaa	When you miscarry it doesn't always come out.I lost two babies and each time I had to have a D&C to prevent infection or other complications.I lost my babies at 8 & 12 weeks.<br>  <br>  NOTICE: I WOULD LOVE FOR THE PERSON THAT GAVE ME A THUMBS DOWN TO CONTACT ME AND EXPLAIN WHY.WHAT I SHARED HERE WAS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. DO SHARE .|`|WPI0Z47saa	In most cases it will come out naturally. If it does not then you need to get a D&C done by the doctor. If you leave it eventually you could get an infection and get really sick. Get it taken care of so not to ruin your chances of having children in the future. Good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It won't get bigger but you would need to go make sure that it all came out or it can cause damage.

It was totally my fault - we had just recently taken away her pacifier and she was having a fit in the store, saying she "needed to suck something" and I was fed up with her crying and so I told her to suck her thumb.  So she did, and she hasn't taken it out since.  Never in a million years did I think that she would pick up a thumb-sucking habit after the age of 2.<br>  <br>  Anyway, we've been trying to get her to stop sucking her thumb ever since.  We've tried putting hot sauce and other bad tasting things on her thumb and that doesn't work - it makes her upset but she sucks her thumb until the taste is gone.  I did some research and found that a lot of kids are not even aware that they are sucking their thumb once it becomes a habit, and the trick is to make them aware of it.  What I just started with my daughter that seems to be working really well so far is putting band-aids on her thumbs.  It doesn't hurt her, and it doesn't taste bad, but it just reminds her not to put her thumb in her mouth.  If she does put her thumb in her mouth, she notices the band-aid before she even gets her thumb all the way in and takes it right back out, and then goes about whatever she is doing.  I'm really hoping that this will be the solution for us.  Good luck!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	none they don't work, my mom tried all that stuff on me. all it did was stop me for a few days. I would forget and continuously put my thumb in my mouth over and over until i got use to it. then i would ask her to put it on sometimes, guess i started to like it. Just let em grow out of it on their own. i did lol.|`|pzlxRbIOaa	Get a little dab of hot sauce and rub it on his thumb. I learned right away.|`|WgyGipBMaa	I sucked my thumb when i was little my dad soaked them in vineger I dont suck my thumb anymore... lol|`|ob3WOb5saa	There is a liquid you can buy (walmart sells it at the pharmacy, just ask for it) and it's about $4.00.  It's kinda like nail polish remover but is safe if it's put in your mouth.  It tastes TERRIBLE (my husband tasted it!)  Anyway, you put it on his thumb and when he puts it in his mouth he will take it out immediately because of the taste.  We used it on our son and he stopped after he put his thumb in his mouth the very first time.  It was amazing!|`|eD51aBzlaa	all these products people are telling you to buy, dont work i'm 17 almost 18 and still suck my thumb. it is a comforting feeling. and you feel very safe. i can not sleep nor do homework without sucking my thumb and having my baby blankie with me. i have had braces and got them off wen i was 16 and they did not stop my thumb sucking. but my teeth are still perfectly straight you cant tell i suck my thumb. he will probably grow out of it. but i know some one who is in his 30s and still sucks his thumb it is verry verry comforting and gives you the feeling as if you are safe. my mother tried everrything in the books to try and get me to stop and nothing worked i found a way to get around everything. <br>  <br>  hope i was some help. <br>  just let him stop on his own. the more you try and get  him to stop  the more he will do it.|`|mbfXOPRXaa	my little sister had that problem.  so, the dentist sent her to the orthodontist and she got a retainer.  just a normal, wire retainer.  but it had a little *cage* type thing that her thumb would hit when she put it in her mouth.  it didnt hurt, it was just a reminder to not suck her thumb.  after that she never sucked her thumb again.  she was eight when she got this though, so if your son isnt older it might not be a good choice.  hope i helped!<br>  <br>  EDIT: try the nail polish type product first, but that didnt work on my sister.|`|ZKm894kfaa	I don't know personally, but when my cousin (who was 13) wouldn't stop sucking her thumb my dad put tabasco sauce on there and guess what she never did it again.  I really hope that my son never starts because he LOVES tabasco and Horse radish (he's 18 months old) a little crazy I know.  He won't eat eggs or hash-browns w/o tabasco and won't eat steak w/o horse radish.|`|yWU57CLYaa	There is a product called something like Thumbs?  I bought it for my girl when she was younger.  It's like fingernail polish that you put on her thumb to keep them from sucking on it.  It didn't work the best for her, since she outsmarted the product by washing her thumb real good.|`|C6pTfVQkaa	My son has been sucking his first and middle fingers since he was born (he's a little over 2 1/2).  He only sucks them when he's sleeping or upset.  I have recently put gloves on him and he has had a little trouble sleeping, but it's getting better.  You may want to try gloves.|`|IZCOuZ7uaa	There's a product called THUM that you paint on your kid's thumb. It tastes terrible and may help break the habit. Your pharmacist will know where it is or they can special order it for you.
MqFeJiukaa	With my 2nd I had developed preeclampsia.  I was put on bed rest and given meds but at 34 weeks I had to be induced because my blood pressure was so high and my weight was dropping and her water was very low.  She was born weighing 5lbs 1oz.  <br>  She had to be taken to Children's hospital in Seattle which was about 3 hrs from where we lived at the time.  She spend the first 3 weeks of her life there.  The first week was in the NICU where she had to get her blood sugar levels up (it was only a 12 at birth), she had jaundice so she needed to be treated with light therapy.  She also could not feed from a nipple.  She was actually pretty lucky compared to most of the babies there.  After a week she was able to be in a normal newborn nursery and we just needed her to learn to feed, keep her sugars level and gain some weight.  <br>  When I brought her home she still needed a tube in her nose (a gavage) to feed which I had to learn to change.  I also had to make sure to set an alarm every 2hrs day and night to feed so her sugars wouldn't drop because she would just sleep through feeding time.<br>  She is now 9 yrs old, very active into soccer and acting classes and perfectly healthy.  She loves high school musical lol You would never known she had a struggle.|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	My baby was born 4 weeks early because they determined my amniotic fluid was low. He was put in the NICU only because he was small (5 lbs) and ended up spending a week only because he came down with jaundice. But I didnt actually have any complications with my labor and delivery. He is now 6.5 months old and does not have any delays he is doing great and seems to be doing everything he is supposed to for his age.
XgxW3as5aa	dont worry, she cant although i like attitude lol. im actually changing mine and i had to go to the court and get a petiton and have it in the newspaper and everything. thank goodness im 18 because otherwise i would need my dad's consent and if she has it filed, she would need a reason into why and of course your consent.|`|WGUfF7reaa	haha I like her she's FUNNE!|`|UXoTCL98aa	I'm pretty sure that she can if your name is not on the birth certificate. If it is she might have a problem them.|`|5LzZYrQnaa	no she has to go to court to change it and you can fight it.
ce8COixxaa	Doesn't sound like it's baby time based on what you've told us. If there were other encounters since then that would change the chances, but I'd say its a very slim to no chance at this point. Losing weight can cause you to miss any time, so that is likely the cause.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I doubt she's pregnant. Theoretically it could be possible but its more likely her period's now irregular due to the exercise, hydroxycut, plan b, etc....If she's really worried she can take a pregnancy test -- 2 weeks late on her period and the test would definitely be positive if she is preg|`|09EWvJs0aa	No she's not pregnant. Sperm dies as soon as it hits air.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't think she's pregnant. It's probably just changes in her body.|`|v3LnJycKaa	yes this is most likely the reason why, also the Plan b can cause her period to become irregular for up to 3 months after use.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	not after the plan b pill
wZAeBisbaa	I did see my son and his friend playing Barbies with his younger sisters once.  But I had to laugh, because the boys were making the dolls "fight," while the girls were the ones who wanted to dress them up.  Does your son by any chance have a sister?  My friend's little boy started doing "girl" things when it seemed to him that his little sister was getting all the attention.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Nothing.  The only reason he'd be playing with barbies is because he is at someone else's house and I wouldn't care.  When I would drop him off at the gym babysitting area I'd always come back to find him dressed up as a princess or fairy.  Turned out the only dress up clothes they have are for girls and my son likes to dress up.  We have tons of dress up outfits at home, darth vader, cop, doctor, ect, and so he wanted to dress up there.  Again, no big deal.  It's something different.  He knows he's a boy.  I think it's when you make a big deal about it that it turns into an issue.  Find something that he likes to do.  Get male action figures or barn sets, something like that if that's what he likes to play with.  We have the bat cave with Batman, Joker, and all the rest.  It looks just like a dollhouse, except it's the Batcave.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	Nothing.  Making a big deal about it will just confuse and frustrate him.  I have a cousin who used to love to play Barbies with my little sisters.  He's 17 now and a real "guy's guy," so it doesn't mean anything, necessarily.  The less gender stereotypes we press on our kids, the better.  I was a tomboy growing up when I was little and it sucked having people judge me for being better at sports than all the boys I played with.  If my boy is into barbie dolls, so what?  I do feel bad for guys, though.  Girls can get away with wearing boy clothes, being into guy activities, etc. a lot more easily than guys can get away with the opposite.  Even if it's just a phase, people judge them for it.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Depends on how old they are if they are really young then I wouldn't care they are just curious.|`|GU3RauKOaa	Let him. If I was concerned about other kids making fun of him I would get Ken dolls and more masculine action figures. There's nothing wrong with a little boy playing with dolls (that is all GI Joes and action figures are anyway! Dolls for boys!). Its important for young kids to be able to roleplay and imagine. And I would be happy to see him playing with regular people dolls instead of soldiers and crap.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	I would tell him she has all those nice things because Ken got to take her clothes off too.|`|ixR3qfYdaa	Let him, he'll grow out of it eventually|`|OuA2cQ8haa	let him get on with it , i used to play with boy toys all the time and im a girly girl.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Buy him some GI Joes, maybe, but I wouldn't freak out or anything.|`|HUQQzph2aa	I'd let him play with what he wants. I don't see anything wrong with it...just a toy.|`|ui7waO1haa	Buy him GI Joes and he'll grow out of it.|`|fRYQfvNaaa	I do not understand this question.<br>  You sound sexist.|`|XrEn3qOIaa	My step-brother used to play with my sister's dolls, and wanted to be Wonder-Woman when he was 5-8 yo. Eventually he grew out of it, (like most kids do). If you make a big deal out of it he will keep doing it, just to get your attention. <br>  <br>  Buy him a GI Joe and "Boys Toys" with lots of pieces that he can take apart (since he seems to like undressing and dressing the dolls).<br>   <br>  He might like to see how things are put together (like LEGOs)...by the way, my step-brother is now a very normal, and well adjusted married man with 2 wonderful little boys of his own.<br>  :)|`|UYnAASPJaa	benn there done that. its just a phase just like my girls took an interest in cars and stuff for awhile. treat it like he is just learning how  to be a dad life skills. talk about what he is doing and go on. if you think it is no big deal so will he. if he thinks he is getting a reaction out of you look out he will play with them until he is 15 lol!!|`|HFRP1Qzgaa	wen i was a kid i played with cars n dat n im female n i came out just fine but it realy doesnt mean anything barbies just intrest him more then playing with cars well there aint much u can do wit a toy car|`|NeTNnvSZaa	What's the big deal?  My son played with Barbie's.  In fact he had his very own at one time, it was the baking Barbie with the little mixer and table etc.  He wanted to cook with me.  So I would cook and he would cook beside me with his Barbie.  No indication of the future.<br>  <br>  He's now 13 and is a very good deer hunter.  Having a Barbie did not effeminate him.|`|AA11210211	Nothing,I would let him play with it,It doesn't mean he is going to grow up to be gay and so what if he does,he is still my child.
WPI0Z47saa	The reason he kicks when you lay down is because when you are active and moving around, you are creating a rocking motion which lulls them to sleep.  If you want him to settle then all you can do is walk around. Also avoid caffeine or other stimulates. But don't try to do anything that can be harmful. It is a GOOD thing that the baby is active. Why would you want to change this? Sometime discomfort comes with pregnancy, that is life.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Be thankful he is active, that means he's healthy! Some babies aren't very active at all and cause all kinds of concerns and worries to mom's. <br>  There isn't much you can do. Just avoid eating too many sweet foods or drinking sweet drinks and see if that helps.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	lol, ignore the dumb blond who replyed first. try talking to him, rubbing your belly, try soothing him. When my aunt was pregnant she had the same problem|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You can adjust your caffeine intake but it sounds like that baby of yours is just an active baby!  Look at the bright side, he wants to play with mama!!!|`|cr2KKT6Naa	play some baby music. next to your tummy. and is there a chance. there could be twins in there. ones sleeping and ones kicking|`|ZNbauLJzaa	People suggest a warm bath??  I was told showers only no baths when I was preg.|`|euN3ct9oaa	I know what you mean. My little guy always kicked so hard too. The bigger he gets the less active he will be- the less room he'll have to kick. When he starts kicking a lot, try to move or change your laying position. Sometimes they don't like the way you're laying down, so it helps at times, even if it is an inch in one direction. Ignore the other people on here, they obviously want something to pick at. Good luck and congrats!<br>  Edit: you can take baths until you get to the last week or two of your pregnancy for bacterial purposes. Ask your doctor about that one to be sure.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	if you want a little break (like and hour or w/e) i think its reasonable.. just try and walk around to lull him to sleep. its hard i know. and when he gets bigger it'll be harder for him to move.  just make sure after his "nap" he's moving normally. oh and stay away form to much sugar!<br>  <br>  WOW some people are over reacting its not like shes asking 'how can i make my baby stop moving permanently" and wth are you talking about give it up for abortion because its kicking the heck out of her. honestly people over reacting much?|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	I totally understand how hard it is to sleep when baby is kicking!!  Unfortunaltely, there'e no way to stop the kicking, at least that i knew of!  My daughter used to get me right up under my ribs....i'd push on my belly to try to move her, but she'd just push back!  I used to think her constant kicking/moving was a way to prepare me for the sleepless nights that were to come.  Good luck!|`|SihmWU0Baa	when you walk or talk to him play music thru head ohones around your stomach it always seems to calm my lil guy down and he sleeps when i walk best thing to do is drink hot tea or milk before bed cuz the warmth might put him to sleep when you sleep place your breast to your knees on a pillow to elevate him and that helped me feel it less but also helped realive my back pressure|`|AA10458750	Haha???That is a DISTURBING question!!! Most normal women are so grateful & happy when they feel their baby move! If you didn't want a baby, you should have thought about that a lonnnngggg time ago. Maybe you should consider adoption, you seem like the type that would harm your baby if it didn't stop crying!!|`|AA11059034	Try a soothing bath something to make you both relax. But other then that be thankful that he is alive and kicking.|`|HQ5R1p9qaa	try talking a warm bath see if it relaxes him a little. that sometimes worked when i was pregnant

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  My daughter acts/models, and we got two books of children's monologues from Amazon.  I do not have them in front of me at the moment, but you can just search for "children's monologues".  Our favorite has a purple cover with theater masks on the front.  THe other one, I believe, is pink and/or orange (the cover).|`|wtLwnszzaa	google it or i have a great book ( i am a proffesional model/actress not kidding!!!) and its called 'great monologues for young actors.' it really helped me!! I used the ugly stepsister one. it was hillarious!! you can pick it up at borders or your local bookstore :D tell your daughter i said best of luck!!!!!
on3CVSgWaa	you need to drink more water...sounds like charlie horses..I got them if I didn't drink enough water|`|gbLht7oFaa	drink water<br>  and strech|`|dPULl5hjaa	talk with your ob/gyn - it sounds like you need to take your prenatal vitamins with along with calcium.  Calcium is for leg cramps.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I was told to stretch your leg out strait and lift your toes towards your head. That helps me
4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	If you have to ask if you're in labor, then you're NOT in labor...lol.  Trust me, you'll know!|`|MqFeJiukaa	Its most likely pre labor.  <br>  I am 39 weeks and have been dilated 2cm since 32 weeks.  I am now 4cm 75% effaced.  I have been having cramping for weeks and lost my mucus plug weeks ago.  I am still working and I am due next Fri.  I even had my membranes stripped and it didn't cause a single contraction.  You need to stop working when you feel to uncomfortable to work.  Its different for everyone.  I sometimes feel pain when I walk because my baby is very low (a -1 station).  Good Luck it won't be long.|`|on3CVSgWaa	You have a ways to go...especially if this is your first baby...work until you are no longer comfortable.
33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	We haven't find out the gender and our 'motive' is we just prefer to be surprised.<br>  <br>  We also aren't telling the names we have picked out because we love them, and there is always someone out there who hates the name for whatever reason and will not hesitate to tell you why your soon to be born baby's name is terrible.  I also feel that when you let people know the names ahead of time, some people interpret it as asking for input, so then they give their opinions.  we aren't interested in opinions...they are the names we have chosen and we love them.  I don't want a seed of doubt planted by someone who has something negative to say about the name.  So there are my motives.  :)|`|bIaywrBCaa	I( am from the old school, had my kids before there was an ultrasound. I used to say I would not like to know the sex of a child. But to be practical, I now think it is the best thing. You can buy the right clothes, decorate the room for a boy or girl. Pick the right names, etc. If I were of the right age and would have another child, I would choose to know. Not sure why they would not want to tell which names they picked unless it is like some questions I have seen on here. people choose a name after much deliberation, then tell a friend or relative the name they have chosen only to learn the other person uses it for their child first.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	I'll be too excited|`|9EdUCTwjaa	i personally would want to be surprised, just because i always like a good surprise. But then again, talk to me after 5months of pregnancy, and by then i may be so hormonal that i'll want to know (nothing wrong with being hormonal...i call it legally expressing my emotions) but i would tell pple my name choices, so they know that i got them first. Either that or, i would tell anyone and wait untill the baby is born and see what name suits them best.<br>  <br>  Girl:<br>  Charlotte Michelle<br>  Amy Bronwyn<br>  <br>  Boy:<br>  Nathan Tyler <br>  Ryan Bronson|`|0BC2WTyoaa	We weren't going to find out for the simple reason that I wanted the big surprise in the hospital.  However, I couldn't wait and even paid for an early gender scan.  :)<br>  As far as the names go, 2 reasons could be they didn't want anyone else to use it or they don't want to hear criticism.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I would not find out the gender.<br>  But I would tell people the name.<br>  <br>  Actually No, I would find out the gender. That way I can pick the best name ever :P and I can get the room done The way a girls or boys room would be.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	I found out, because I wanted to plan and figured a surprise is a surprise no matter when you find out.  It's still surprising in the middle of the pregnancy just like it would be at birth.  And, I shared the names we were thinking of, but wish I hadn't.  We didn't pin down the final one until about 12 hours after she was born--we were just calling her baby girl.  And the reason it took so long was that people would make fun of or judge then names we came up with.  The one we went with was one of the first we had agreed we both liked, but I had coworkers make fun of it and it turned me off of it almost to the point of picking something more common...we named her Aya Brynne, but she was one last minute change of mind away from being Isabel Reina (which wouldn't fit her at all, LOL).<br>  <br>  The people who decide not to find out usually think it's the more natural way, or makes labor more rewarding to be working toward that surprise.  I don't agree, but I can see where they're coming from.  And as for keeping the names secret, the main reasons are probably to not have the name stolen, to not worry if they change their minds about it and to keep people from giving unwanted input.|`|0Of1i0Ruaa	My friend's mother always warned me to keep my picks a secret.  She was pregnant with a girl the same time that her sister-in-law was, and she shared the name she had decided on, which was Kiana.  Lo and behold, her sister-in-law delivered a month earlier than she did and named HER little girl Kiana.  So of course she couldn't use the same name and had to find another.<br>  <br>  I would like to keep the sex a mystery until birth, how many wonderful little mysteries like that are you going to get in life?  And as long as the baby is healthy, I don't care.|`|iup3ZrS7aa	well i could go either way. i have two children a boy who is 3 and a girl who is 5 months. i wanted to know the sex of both of them from the start, just because i couldnt wait and so i could plan, but i think with my third it wouldnt matter since i have one of each and plus it would be a huge surprise at the end for me and my husband and my family. and i told everyone the names the moment when we decided, but some people just want to wait to tell the names to make it more of a surprise at the end. and with the sex of the baby! everyones different right?|`|tw1uePBbaa	for me, it is all about superstition and surprise.  i always heard it was bad luck to know the baby's sex beforehand and besides, i want to be surprised.  as far as the names go, i don't want to know for sure what i am going to name by child until i see them for the first time.  i will have ideas obviously, but i want to base the name off of our first face to face.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	I told everyone, I couldn't keep it a secret. I was too excited.<br>  The name, I told them the names I had chosen, but I didn't decide what to name my child until she came out. Well maybe a little bit before that...but I was still open to changing my mind if she just came out looking like someone different.<br>  My mom really disliked the name I chose, but didn't voice it too much. But now she agrees, the other name choices would never fit my child. Her name suits her perfectly.|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I wanted to know what I was having as soon as I found out I was pregnant! I couldn't wait to tell everyone else. And as for the name I'm always asking opinions from my family and friends. They always have an update on my latest name phases. That's just me.<br>  <br>  I understand some people wanting to be surprised about what they're having. That's cool, I just don't have the patience! As for keeping the name a secret, I would like to see what answers you get back on that myself.|`|UYnDxJWDaa	We are going to find out the sex of our baby, but we aren't telling anyone our name choices.  Partially because we aren't 100% committed to one name yet, we just have a short-list, but mostly because you will NEVER find a name that everyone likes.  We don't want to have to listen to friends, family members, coworkers, etc etc etc telling us that they don't like the name or we should be picking something else.  We aren't telling people the name until it is on the birth certificate so it's pointless for them to whine to us.  And even then I won't share the rest of the names on our list because I know we are having more kids down the road.|`|WIEPISyeaa	I want to know the sex of my child, but I don't want to tell people my name choices either.  It's only because if you wait until you have the baby and it's already named that, people are a lot less likely to voice their (sometimes insensitive) opinions about the name than if you choose it early on and people feel like their opinions won't offend because it's more just a name you are "thinking" about than a name you are actually naming your child.<br>  <br>  Like, I know that if I tell my mom what I will name my baby she will most likely be pretty straightforward about whether or not she likes it....and even though I am not going to let my mom choose what I name my baby, I don't want to feel insecure about it and have 9 months (or 6 months, or whatever....) to stew about whether or not it really is the one I want, etc.<br>  <br>  That's all! :)
SsCMH480aa	yes you can....i had unprotected sex the day before my period and i found out 2 mnths later that i was pregnant....so if u done it i suggest going to buy a pregnancy test|`|SihmWU0Baa	yes you can get pregnant on your period|`|wKuQC4yTaa	If you had your period your not pregnant|`|X0ooc06vaa	doubt it but possible.|`|71666e2ead7e63aae9cf35bc3d3a361daa	i don't see how.  the period happens when you body expells the last egg it deposited and before it deposits the next one. there is nothing for the sperm to fertilize.|`|Gkf2nS51aa	yes you can get "prego" and him taking it out doesnt stop that! you are probably pregnent, take a test and see  good luck|`|96HWpdkFaa	It can happen..it's not very likely..but it has happend.|`|eya1WDS4aa	You can get pregnant at any time of the month when having sex. yes you can get pregnant if you had sex right before your period. yes it would be too soon to tell if you just had your period. Pulling out is not a form of birth control. you can get pregnant from pre c*m.
25aCEsHtaa	sounds like it could be pregnancy... but just in case its not you want to always prepare yourself just in case. its always hard waitng so you might have to do somethings to get your mind off of it. my nipples were sore off and on so i thought it was AF then one day they just stayed sore. GOOD LUCK AND LOTS OF BABY DUST TO  U  just remember it will happen when you least expect it cause i was tryin then gave up and it happened just like that.|`|tvQlx8Skaa	I think that you need to take the test.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I have a disease called 'endometriosis', and your 'symptoms' sound very much like this disease. I don't want to scare you or upset you. But if you are serious about wanting a family, then please google search the symptoms of endometriosis, and see if you feel like that sounds like what you are going through. If left untreated it can and will stop you from ever having a family. I'm 32 and just found out that I had it a year ago, we are now going through tons of fertility treatments to try to make our family. But there's no promise that it will work. Please look into it, I don't want anyone else going through what I'm going through, it is truly extremely emotional. I wish you the best of luck
NCZK0QyGaa	Because the baby is drooling and swallowing more drool than you ever thought possible, you may notice loose stools in the diaper. Loose bowel movements may be a part of teething, but if there's anything more than an extra-poopy diaper, if there is fever, mucous or blood in the stools, or if the diarrhea is violent, you should take your baby to the doctor for help because the diarrhea probably isn't related to teething. And if your child is experiencing even the mild diarrhea associated with teething, there may be diaper rash, too. And you thought this couldn't be more fun!|`|DKqsFGymaa	I would say coincidence.<br>  <br>  I'm a daycare provider and have had many, many teething children in my care, but have never had vomiting associated with the teething.<br>  <br>  It's that time of year for stomach viruses, so my guess is she also has some sort of virus.<br>  <br>  Have a good weekend!  Hope she gets better.|`|nYioXmnGaa	My son  did not throw up during  teething . So I think you should ask a doctor about this one!!!!|`|l7U9dGrWaa	no i have 3 children and none of them where sick because of teething but they have made themselves sick when they have cried for while it all the mucus from the mouth and the nose running back down there throat.|`|7f0mKbzCaa	No, that's probrably something more seriousy than just teething. Your baby shouldn't be having a fever just from that.|`|h93SVSxLaa	Check with the dr on the vomitting. Not usually a "typical" symptom. Keep the fluids up and check her temp just be sure nothing else is going on. Good Luck
MqFeJiukaa	You are having round ligament pain.  Its from your uterus stretching and its really common mid pregnancy.  I had it all 5 times.  Don't worry just try to take it slow with no sudden movements or you will get a zap.<br>  <br>  As always call your dr if you have ANY concerns...|`|fHgbL046aa	I am 19 weeks and 6 days pregnant and I have been getting sharp pains and a lot of cramps too. The pains I get are below my belly button and on the left and right side. I'm gonna talk to my midwife about this. I've had cramps and a lot of pain since the beginning of the pregnancy. Some days are good and other days I wanna lay in a fetal position in bed. LOL|`|dCLnLlsCaa	I had the exact same thing, I'm not 25 weeks and don't feel them anymore.  They are caused by the muscles stretching, they could also be gas, but I understand your worry because they do hurt.  Just to be safe though you should ask your dr. or midwife.|`|h85kkDsbaa	Some pain during pregnancy is normal as your baby is growing and your body is making room for your little one, but if this is really bad pain such as cramps then you should go to hospital. The pain you should be feeling is like muscle pain. Good luck X
W1p6LetFaa	Sounds like implantation bleeding to me, since it usually occurs about 5-10 days after conception (if you conceived).  It usually is either pink or brown in color and lasts anywhere from a few hours to two days.  It sounds like you had sex about the time of ovulation, so it sounds like implantation bleeding to me, but like the other answerer said, it could be something else.  If your period is late, definitely take a test, because you could be pregnant.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Yes it could be.  Sounds like what implantation is...however my last cycle I had spotting around the same time as you, I thought I was pregnant.  I wasn't.  Your cervix could have been irritated from sex, or a cyst burst.....I would take a pregnancy test when your period is due, but your chances are good.|`|vTra7n5baa	Absolutely!  It doesn't matter what time of the month, if you have unprotected sex multiple times the way you did, then your chances of being pregnant are much higher.  See a doctor to be totally sure, but what you're describing sounds like an early pregnancy to me.|`|QW5MhnB8aa	If you had sex during your period, chances are, you're not pregnant. Pink dots are signs of pregnancy though, wait a couple of days or so and if you notice your nipples getting darker than usual then take a pregnancy test.
B7iSU8UYaa	Symptoms can vary so much between individuals and even pregnancies. Since your period is due, go out and buy a pregnancy test to confirm it. Good luck!|`|dPULl5hjaa	That wasn't my case - my period stopped, tired, stomach was queasy.<br>  <br>  Maybe your period is a little late.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Very tired and dizzy.  Bloated uncomfortably!|`|nluNSDI4aa	Well everyone is different because the fact that your boobs don't hurt is nothing. Not everyone experience the same symptoms and some even no symptoms at all! My first symptom as fatigue tired and sleepy all the time. I would go to bed early(still do) and feel exhausted. Then I had frequent head aches, sore boobs, back ache, waking up at 4:30am every morning, and nausea with some vomiting. The only thing I have now is moody, morning sickness can barley keep anything down!, head aches, bloated, and fatigue. Also my boobs have gotten bigger and it looks like my nipples are darkening.I do have a lot of white discharge now 2. Im 6wks. Take a test tho or go to your doctor, thats better.Pray all is well tho:)|`|DutTBV3caa	i didnt have any discharge before i found out and my boobs still haven't really hurt. maybe you're experiencing leukorrhea. i guess its a milky color. <br>  here's some information on it. <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_vaginal-discharge-during-pregnancy_270.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_vaginal-disc...</a><br>  oh and cramping can be a sign on pregnancy and with some women they're more gasy then normal. <br>  hopefully its your month!<br>  tons of luck and baby dust to you! :)|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My boobs never hurt..<br>  <br>  My earliest symptoms were my missed period, light cramping, fatigue, and a little extra discharge...Not alot though..<br>  <br>  Don't get discouraged if you don't get a BFP right away.  I didn't get a positive test result until I was 7 days late!|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	my boobs were hurting and i started eating a lot..  when i hit the 6 week mark i started gettin morning sickness|`|IOp3knBjaa	Well first I will wish you the best of luck. With my first 2 sons I really did not have any symptoms before I missed my period other than my tummy was kind of bloated, jeans were tight and I was eating a little more, but nothing very noticeable. However with my 3rd son due in June of this year, my boobs were sore, I did have the bloated tummy again, lots of white discharge and my most noticeable symptom was that I was severely constipated (gross I know), but that also helped me to know something was up because that was a problem I've never really had! Anyways, best of luck!|`|hO3qUfOQaa	Take a test. Good luck :]<br>  <br>  Clear discharge - Period coming<br>  Yellow Discharge - Yeast In.<br>  White Discharge - Pregnant/ Ovulation time :]|`|dR2bqUixaa	Before I found out that I was pregnant I had white discharge, I was gassy, and I started feeling dizzy EVERY day til I found out. I also started gaining a little weight in my stomach area, but not too much.|`|h85kkDsbaa	I didn't have any symtoms before i found out, you should take a test if you are trying then there is a good chance. Keeping my fingers crossed for you hun XXX|`|8vV145Peaa	white to clear discharge<br>  yeast infection<br>  feeling really sick in the mornings<br>  like puky and tired|`|KdqaGnlwaa	Before I got my BFP, I had a lot of white discharge, so much it had me running to the restroom every 5 minutes thinking my period had started.  After I got a positive pregnancy test, I started getting really tired, my nipples were really really sore, and I had some nausea. But think about it, when you miss your period, you are probably about 2 to 3 weeks pregnant.  When I had my first ultrasound, my baby measured at 6 wks 2d and according to my LMP, I should've been almost 8 weeks. If you are pregnant, you probably wont start getting symptoms till next week. Or you might be one of the lucky ones and not feel none at all. Good Luck!
4NcshCDvaa	I babysit a 6 year old little boy who is so hyper and when he is hyper he is SO MEAN!! <br>  You really have to find something that engages her mind and gets her focused on something. What works for me is looking up some sort of craft online that you can do with household items. I would look on up for you..but I don't know what you have lying around your house or the parents house. But that seems to get him involved and calm him down. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hopefully that works for you too!!|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Have a dance party.<br>  Put on a workout video (my 7 year old loves them)<br>  Play simon says<br>  Play hide and seek<br>  Color<br>  Make something to eat<br>  Put her in the bathtub with tons of bubbles and toys<br>  Pop popcorn and watch a movie|`|JwDWwgIcaa	ask what she wants to do<br>  <br>  ;D|`|Hj5sXNI7aa	have a schedule for her. Have something planned for the first hour, like have her look at a map and have her tell you what the states are. I know this sounds strange, but there are 50 of them, plus, she is learning. Tell her its a game. You might find an interactive game that someone has like leapfrog. It to will keep her busy for a while and learn. Then, She is someone that has to  be doing, so, making things would be fun for her. Get some kit at walmart to make necklaces, ect... These kids, love to do that. also, try drawing with her. Tell her to wrtie a story about her day. Girls like to write these things. Teach her how to cook, they love to stir, make cookies with her. Have her decorate each one with something. Have a reading time as a treat for doing so well, and then bed. Be creative, you can do this. Look at it as a challenge, not a problem, You will be ok. <br>  good luck.|`|40527ad60966d944ca757e8d6d1c6c28aa	Board games- they are usually inexpensive cuz there's loads of these in every family's closet.

In theory the name sounds pretty...but in reality your daughter may get sick of 'dealing with it' all the time.  Perhaps Kiersten is a better spelling?  I still pronounce it as k-ear-stin.|`|cErLq7f3aa	maybe kierstyn. but it goes good with natalie|`|19JRf8Cxaa	I love the name, it is beautiful! Good think ing spelling it Kearstin because if you spell it Kirstin people will think it is (kur-sten)|`|IlSALGKMaa	Isn't it Kyrstin? I think that looks better. It's pretty, though. :)|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I have a little cousin names Kiersten and it took me a little while to pronounce it correctly :) but I think it's really cute. Natalie sounds good with it.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Kirsten Natalie is ok.  I don't like Kearstyn or Kearstin.|`|dDDCoIjkaa	I have a friend with this name and it is spelled Kiersten.

B7iSU8UYaa	To avoid wasting money and stress on multiple tests, wait 14 days after intercourse and take a pregnancy test. I prefer the digital kind, since I think they are more accurate and easier to read. Good luck!|`|hswTS1jVaa	First day of missed period. Usually 2 weeks after sex.|`|G1j3Ja5Iaa	about 2 weeks after ovulation...this is when your period is due. if you miss it, take a test. good luck|`|OpVysSzQaa	any pregnancy test is best taken a day or two into your missed period. some say they can test the day before, or the first day. but if you wait a couple days, there's no harm.|`|gDvqoxZVaa	U can start having symptoms up to 2 weeks after conceiving. wait at least 5 days after a missed period.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Wait until your period is normally due, then test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RakOH0Ptaa	you can know after two weeks the deed was done!!! Hopefully you find out as early as possible..unlike like me!! I found out when i was two months!!|`|AA11832068	The best day to test is a day or two after you miss a period, but I was eager also.  I tested two days before mine was due and got my positive!  Good luck.
4sjW4Ig5aa	You think she's unfit because she dares call you, the father, when your child is ill?<br>  <br>  Small children are notoriously picky eaters, that doesn't make her unfit either.<br>  <br>  Her house may be a mess, in fact, I'm sure it is. It's hard enough to work, raise a kid, keep house, and keep your sanity with a husband, it's that much harder on your own. Having said all that, being a poor housekeeper doesn't make her unfit either.<br>  <br>  All this list demonstrates to me, is that you are clueless as to what it takes to raise a child on your own and as a result have unreal expectations. <br>  <br>  Try being alittle more supportive.<br>  <br>  Edit: And how often for how long do you have her? Weekends? Every other weekend? Once a month? It's different when it's full time. Do you have all her toys and clothes at your house to keep up with, on top of your own belongings? It's not the same part time, can't compare the two. My best friend has joint custody with her ex. 2 wks at her house, 2 wks at his. Her house is a wreck, his is nice and tidy. Know why? She has all their laundry and all their toys, plus a full time job, and still gets the thrill of hauling them to what ever sports practice they are involved in depending on the time of year. They pack up all their clothes and toys to take with them, and then bring them home dirty to their mom to clean up. God forbid that her ex pay child support, or even supply them with clothing and belongings to keep at his house. This way, his ex is stuck with the bill, the responsibility, and the work, full time, while he gets to play dad at his convenience. Please... be a better man than he is.<br>  <br>  So she calls you when your daughter is sick? What's wrong with knowing that you are overwhelmed and need help? She's your daughter too. <br>  <br>  You get her to try new foods? Bully for you! Just because you can and she can't doesn't make you better or her unfit. Just means that your daughter responds differently to you in some situations. <br>  <br>  Instead of focusing on punishing your ex, try to focus on making a positive impact on your daughter's life. Do what you can to help your ex help her grow into the woman you'd like her to become some day.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	How does that make her unfit?  If you've spent any time with children at all you would know they go through food phases, especially when they're young.  You ex sounds overworked and stressed out.  Maybe instead of kicking her when she's down you could act like a human being in the best interest of your child?|`|MMCaaZFyaa	Her not knowing how to cook doesn't make her "unfit", though she is being irresponsible for allowing her 3 year old to eat so much junk food. There are plenty of healthier options for kids and you don't need to know how to "cook", but obviously she's not motivated enough to do anything about it...<br>  <br>  She calls you for help because she doesn't know what to do when she's sick? She freaks out or something?<br>  <br>  It just sounds like mom is a bit on the immature side. She doesn't sound "unfit". I say it'd be wise to just help out your daughter and do for HER sake, and forget about the grudge against mom. No use to try to take her to court over something like this.....they would laugh at you.|`|mrphEDWcaa	I bet if you had custody of her that your house would be a mess too. It's hard taking care of a small child and getting everything else done too and she is probably working outside of the house as well so she can support your daughter and herself. If you don't want to help physically then you have no room to talk.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	that doesn't nessecarily make her unfit. it makes her lazy, but not unfit. there isn't much legally you could do. she sounds lazy. i would ask her if she would consider switching the visitation times. ask her if you could keep your daughter during the week, and she take her on the weekends. act like you are doing it for "her" to help her with the "stress" that she goes through. if not, it doesn't cost that much, to file a civil suit, and ask to speak with a judge. that is all you would need to do. you don't need a lawyer to help you tell the judge that you think your daughter would be better off with you. there are tons of women that are like this with their kids. it is a shame. not nessecarily their kids being picky eaters, but being too lazy to do anything about it. good luck, and ihope it works out for you.|`|UYnAASPJaa	maybe she trust your advice on both of your guy's child or wants you to know when the baby is sick maybe she thinks you care. one of my kids would only eat chicken nuggets for a while she went hungry a few days over it. and hey my house is a mess. John is that you? lol just kidding. just be there if she calls be ready to go get your kid, it just gives you more time with her. most moms are not unfit just unprepared.|`|2exwzXiBaa	I am sorry to say that there is probably not much you can do.  If there is electric, running water and food in the house no matter what it is that is all they care about.  She is eating.  I am in the same situation and that is what was told to me, the house can be trashed but as long as it has what I mentioned it does not matter.  Still, try and call friend of the court or CPS and talk to someone there and see what advice they can give you.  I wish you all the luck.|`|AA11523772	She's not unfit. She's a single mother, an inexperienced one. That's where you come in. Instead of criticizing her, help her.  Don't worry about who is the better parent, because both of you need to be the better parent and that means helping each other out since you can't be together. Your a good father and that's why she turns to you for help. So be a good person, and help her.
5DJcir9saa	Like a baby|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Like an angel wrapped in a blanket with a tiny little blue and white and pink beenie on!! :)|`|p2Njf5gBaa	2 eyes, 1 nose,  about 6-9 lbs,  19-21 inches long,  10 toes, and 10 fingers.|`|ORpbq3bAaa	it all depends on genes. i had a baby girl and everybody said she was gonna look like her father. but when she was born she looked like me. but now she is starting to look like her dad.|`|dShnJ20raa	Depends on genetics. On who's the father and the mom etc. No way to know until the baby comes out.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Like a small human.|`|POGZZmoUaa	Look at your family and you will find some clues.  If everyone has blue eyes then chances are your baby will too.  Both my husband and I have thick, curly hair and extra wide feet.  We knew that would be two characteristics of our babies...and we were right.  As their personality develops it will enhance their looks.  When they are a few hours old, they all look like little prizefighters.|`|gdlc9Jg4aa	He will look like an umpa lumpa.<br>  Good Luck with that!
7Zw1cEmPaa	Yes you can|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yes. Sometimes women ovulate during their period. You just need to ovulate and have unprotected sex to get pregnant. If you don't want to get pregnant ALWAYS use protection.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	While unusual it is POSSIBLE as you may ovulate early in your cycle and sperm can live for up to 5 days.|`|bXYoVhDEaa	Yes you can. There could still be an egg hanging around that could be fertilised|`|v9cORzzfaa	That's disgusting|`|c2YcBbXyaa	you can get a STD..........|`|AA11763588	You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you start your period and sperm can hang out for 72 hours waiting on an egg.    If you don't want kids right now it would just be safer to always use protection.|`|LDfXMfyYaa	thats jus nastyyyyyy|`|x0J8S5sWaa	Of course you can. There is no "safe time." If you don't know things like this you shouldn't even be having sex.|`|AA12117293	If you have sex, no matter under what circumstance, you CAN, and people HAVE, gotten pregnant.    If you use a condom, you CAN STILL get pregnant.    If you use birth control, you CAN STILL get pregnant.    If you use the withdraw method... guess what.... you CAN STILL GET PREGNANT.    and....      IF YOU HAVE SEX WHILE MENSTRUATING........ you CAN STILL get PREGNANT.            There you go.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	yes may be|`|IALsvRn8aa	yup|`|I9LTTno2aa	OF COURSE U CAN AND IF YOU HAD TO ASK THAT QUESTION YOU SHOULDN'T BE HAVING SEX. NOW LETS GO OVER THIS AGAIN FOR EVERYONE WHO ASK THIS QUESTION. YES YOU CAN GET PREGNANT IF YOU HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX NO MATTER WHAT. SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET PREGNANT USE A CONDOM IT IS THAT SIMPLE|`|YzpVg0zAaa	Technicaly, yes.Hope this answer does not add to your worries.Use protection ALWAYS if you do not want/plan a pegnancy.|`|cie3oBcXaa	Yes it is still possible|`|4Dn7JRFWaa	100% yes|`|12wihgzHaa	i dont understand why people ask such stupid questions???!!!!!!|`|7GHkeHZpaa	hough possible, it is highly unlikely that you will get pregnant during your monthly menstrual cycle. During your period, your body works to shed the uterine lining that it has been building up over the last month, in preparation for pregnancy. When you don't become pregnant, small uterine contractions begin, encouraging the unfertilized egg and unused endometrium to be shed from the uterus and through the vagina. This means that there is no egg in the fallopian tubes to become fertilized and no lining to help a developing embryo to implant properly.    This being said, there is a small possibility of pregnancy during your period. Women often mistake slight bleeding that can occur with ovulation as their period. Unprotected sex at this time can greatly increase your chances of becoming pregnant. Additionally, sperm can live in the female reproductive system for up to three days. Because some women ovulate at the very end of their menstrual periods, sperm may still be alive at this point, and able to fertilize an egg.|`|SlhEgGl2aa	THATS JUST NASTY JESUS.............|`|f9722814adc28042e2facb09ed607946aa	yes|`|deknpCEBaa	you have more chance of getting pregnant wen on the period, your ovaries are more open, and your own bodily fluid will carry the sperm longer, so more sperm cells will reach your ovaries so a better chance of conceiving. also the chance of contracting STI's is marginally higher.|`|hi9SYnrraa	i did. i wanted to wait a few days though.never understand guys
0FXVTZf7aa	The site below makes counter arguments from the Bible for the religious issues around premarital sex, but it also covers some other things as well.

Doubled? How could that be when sex ed is offered in schools today and the topic is more openly discussed? The number of unmarried teen parents was around 10% in the 1950's and 80% unmarried in 2002. The numbers don't seem to be going down with more education. We have condom commercials, shows like Talk Sex and Dr. Drew, sex ed in schools with and without teaching abstinence and nothing is changing. I think we better come up with some new ideas instead of trying the same old thing hoping that THIS time it will work.|`|XkbHGqExaa	I guess I can't help bc I think it should.|`|WEeB4h5baa	abstinence education doesn't work and leaves kids unprepared for sex, and 'safer sex'  google the statistics on 'abstinence only" programs, and find what dismal failures they are.   teen pregnancy is MORE prominent among teens who have been in abstinence only programs, as opposed to 'safer sex' programs.|`|MrGaUKIVaa	in my opinion your best bet to winning the debate would be to attack the issue of the cost of the programs that teach sex education. in the idea that the cost of teaching sex education could go towards the failing issues of our high schools today. it is my understanding that majority of todays high schools are not meeting the requirements of government standards, therefore should be cut down on exterior teachings such as sex education.|`|6wh7lHpyaa	because abstinence is saying you shouldn't have sex until your married where as life is that its your choice and should be an act of love! no one can tell you when your ready or if u love someone only you can make that decision and it shouldn't be frowned upon to show your feelings in a way that compromises religion or how ppl see you.... its unfair to tell someone when they can have sex|`|WNsjy5oFaa	what is your arguement against sex education in schools?   children need to be taught how to mature into young responsible adults, which means giving them all them information that they need to make informed decisions about their own lives, this includes abstinence, contraception and emotional issues.  not all parents are able to teach their children the facts whether it be due to ignorance or embarassment. therefore there will always be a place for sex education in school|`|551d897f0abf6a9c090f9e8bea28b76daa	Because it should be up to the parents to teach their children about abstinence and/or safe sex when they feel it is right to talk to their kids about it. Too many issues like this are left to the schools to teach the kids about and not much is left to the parents. I was talked to by my mother before our school talked to us about sex education. I think peer pressure would cause the kids to not pay attention or take it seriously if they see their friends are just finding it a big joke.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	I would go for the "sex education fixes the wrong problem" argument: that fundamentally, it's natural to learn these things from parents, from relationships around us, etc.  Yet, our society is so broken, that most people are growing up without a lot of social examples around them, without a safe, secure person to ask for advice from.  Trying to educate children in a formal setting regarding something that happens and should be picked up in an informal, social setting, is inappropriate, or even dangerous, and belies a much larger, underlying problem with our culture.
Zkfj2f9Oaa	If you are pregnant it would be highly likely that it would be showing positive by now so give another test a try.  Keep in mind there are some people who just don't show up on pregnancy tests for quite awhile.  Unusual but certainly does happen.  A positive test means you are pregnant, a negative test does not guarantee you are not.  Home tests rely on detective of HCG hormone in your urine.  This is strongest in your first wee in the morning.  I will give it a try first thing tomorrow.  Good luck for whatever result you are wanting.
HVXtd2Ryaa	"I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend last night and now my period is five days late, could I be pregnant?"    Did you never take sex ed?    Yes, yes, yes.

So you could be feeling your baby move and not even realize it. I guess the best way to describe the 1st movement is you think you might have to fart, but not really. haha. I know it's crazy but, it just feels like a little gas pocket, or butterflies too. Also if you're thin you would be able to feel it sooner, but if you're over weight, ( or just a little bit), it might be a little while. If you're worried about it, ask your doc, but you should be feeling it pretty darn soon.
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	You sound like you are stressing over it.  If you had all these tests I think you would be not pregnant.

ATyHswTTaa	ever think that the father is the better parent?? kids need rules to follow and routine or get out hand in later life.. they like living with their dad as seem he is the stable person in their life and looks after them alot better then the mother it seems esp if saying the kids were takin by social services from the mother, must mean she wasnt doing good job at been a mother!!!|`|X6as2nOAaa	There could be many reasons he could give them more attention or they are more spoiled there.

That's why drs should monitor you closely while on clomid.  Some women can be overstimulated and their ovaries could even rupture.<br>  <br>  Clomid also lengthens most women's cycles.  You might ovulate a few days later than normal.  Keep using the lh strips until you get the positive.|`|1dOFZC82aa	Hi - I'm also on my second cycle of clomid (day 9 today for me).  It sounds like you're about to ovulate.  I often will have some small cramps when I ovulate.  I believe the technical term is mittleshmerz (meaning middle pain, but don't quote me on the spelling of that).  It's totally normal.  And Clomid can definitely change your CM - so I totally understand your confusion.  The only thing I could rely on last month on clomid was my cervix position - it stayed reliable:) <br>  Just keep having sex, and hopefully in another two weeks you'll get a BFP!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!

9IFF0vIoaa	If your wife was on birth control...that could time some time to fully leave her system.  Also...if you're not having sex when she's ovulating that could be an issue.<br>  <br>  Six months isn't that long...most docs wouldn't even do any tests at that point.  They would wait 1-2 years to see if you still can't conceive.  Then...depending on your ages they may suggest some different things.|`|H74F8jxuaa	My husband and I have been trying for 6 months also.  I know how you feel.  It would be a good idea to buy a fertility monitor or opk's to know for sure when she is ovulating.  It is better to know when you are ovulating so that you can have sex leading up to and including ovulation day and it will increase your chances.  Sometimes, it takes a normal healthy couple up to a year sometimes to get pregnant, so don't give up!  Good luck.|`|jNPCT96Xaa	First, 4-6 months is not that long for trying to conceive, even though it may feel like it. If you are young and are not pregnant within 12 months, see a doctor, both of you. She should start charting her basal body temperature (google it if you must) so you have an accurate window of when ovulation occurs. With a lot of young people, it is a timing issue. But if nothing happens in a couple of months, go get checked out. It could be one or both of you. <br>  <br>  Goos Luck!|`|DRiSewgTaa	you need to go to the doctor and plus 4-6 months is not that long. Me and my husband have been trying for over 2 years.

Its tough when your baby isnt themselves. I remember sitting in a steamy bathroom when I was a child. It cleared it up well. Now my aunt said they suggest cold air? She said she would bundle her baby up in a blanket sit on a rocking chair on her back porch and sing the baby to sleep. She said it worked.

Running a hot shower and steaming up the bathroom is good. Or take him out in the cool night air.<br>  Trust your doctor.  Most doctors have advice lines you can call after hours and on weekends too.  Call that if you get worried.

As do 90 percent of young mothers.<br>  Don't judge someone until you have walked a mile in their shoes|`|a3ZZkY08aa	I think teens should wait until theyre ready to have children...if they wanna have sex--USE protection!|`|AA11004428	my opinion is that they are wasting the best years of their lives with a huge responsibility. i think they should wait until they are settled down in a house or apartment and are self-sufficient...not living off their parents or the government. but if they choose to be young parents it's definitely not for me to judge them.|`|AA11850523	not a good idea<br>  <br>  I was 21 when my son was born<br>  I had been married for 2 years<br>  owned my own home<br>  I had a career established<br>  We divorced when son was 2 1/2 <br>  <br>  Looking back .. I was way too young to be responsible for another human being <br>  <br>  babies are cute, fun BUT they grow up<br>  they need 24/7 care <br>  they need a stable parent who can provide for the child's physical , Emotional, and financial needs and care|`|2pq3y2ghaa	I had my daughter at 16 & i've managed really well. I look after her just as well as any mum. She's now 4 and is a really loving child. She's never gone without. <br>  I hate the stereotypical idea that all teenage mums are bad mums.<br>  I'm now at university and have a part-time job, her dad is still in her life.. I think that as long as the teenager realises what looking after a baby entails, and they can support the child, they can become a good a parent as anyone else.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	It normally either puts a burden on the teens parents or on the tax payers.Everyone makes mistakes,but it should not be our obligation to pay for it.I was a teenager once too,but morals and responsibility was introduced to me as an adolescent.More parents should try that..|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	I had my first child at 17 - and it wasn't easy.  I wouldn't change anything because she is a blessing. <br>  <br>  I would not recommend this for any teenager.  There is so much to do before having to settle down.  Live your life so when you are ready to have kids you have a lot to share with them. <br>  <br>  No one has the right to judge anyone  -|`|AjBpAPpdaa	It's Irresponsible...I mean, they are just kids themselves they shouldn't be having sex at such a young age anyway.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	it's sad how parents dont take care of their teenagers.|`|DIA8RRe2aa	I was a teen parent and I was lucky to be blessed with alot of help but thats not the case for most and to be honest, even with all the help that i got I was nowhere near ready to be a parent. There's so much that I didn't get to do. Now Im almost 30 and I want to go to college in the worst way but I have to work 2 jobs... If you can wait and if you can't, don't have baby after baby, give yourself the opportunity to care for your child and better your life - for the both of you =)|`|6ErVPePEaa	A bad idea. How can a child themselves raise another child? A teenager has no business having a baby. Just my opinion. kids are a lot of work, and I think teenagers need to be just that, teenagers. Wait until they have a career, and enough stability in their lives before even thinking of bringing another life into this world|`|PJBjllsVaa	it's a bad idea. kids shouldn't be having kids. they have no way to take care of them without the help of others. there is no way for them to go to school, have a 'fun' social life or to even get a job and be apart of the world. i think teenagers need to seriously think about their future... being a teenager you get to be 'selfish' (what i mean is they don't always have to worry about someone else they have to take care of). when your a mom there is no more selfish or doing things just because you want to.|`|GuzZdOEWaa	I don't recommend it. I had my daughter at 16 and although I don't regret it I missed out on a lot. Is it possible to finish high school and achieve all your goals? Absolutely, it just might be more difficult.

I know I did.|`|g0Jd46Xxaa	its ridiculous. not mature enough, they're GROWING up WITH the baby basically. there's just life experiences you need before you jepordize a kids life and the way he'll turn out because you want a cute baby to play with with no consequences.|`|rHKqEQGTaa	personally i think it's wrong if it wasn't planned, the child will go unloved and forced love will have to take place between the parents, nothing really is good about it|`|0HYxVe56aa	teenagers haveing kids is stupid but having sex is ok always wear a condom. :P|`|zd8WW4PFaa	I think its overall a bad idea. <br>  It can ruin the teens life, and the babys.|`|uBAP6sqzaa	It's not the smartest thing.<br>  But I wont judge|`|e7fc19f18cbd035167d14c7438969a09aa	kids cant raise kids...
TQW5E6olaa	Toys--single---c'mon :) Of course they're in the gutter!!<br>  <br>  I do, I'm on something like 4 email lists for recalls specifically for children's products, I get them almost daily.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Nope. I actually don't. The only things I keep track of are items such as car seats.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	They've tried to put some of my questions in weird categories too. Any ways to answer your questions. I am on emailing lists for recalled toys as well so that I can keep up to date on them. I also used to work for a retail company so I call them and find out what is on the recall list. I want my children to be as safe as I can possibly make them.|`|Kf9SoNmoaa	Ugh, I wish I could. I've never been entirely on top of things. *winks* I mean, Anna's young enough that she won't have anything like Polly Pockets or Barbies that are being recalled more and more frequently, but that doesn't stop me from going through a long "is this safe or not" process whenever Anna gets a new toy. <br>  <br>  And Yahoo! thinks I'm crazy. They keep saying that all of my questions go in Mental Health. *rolls eyes*|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I try to keep up to date on recalled toys and foods<br>  <br>  I think the fact that you used "date" in your question is why they want to put your question in the dating category.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Honestly i'm horrible with this, If it doesn't make the news...I don't know about it. Guess I should look into it more often.|`|eya1WDS4aa	nope i dont. sounds bad i know but, their have been lead in toys for a long time, and my son has a lead test every 6 months because of where my husband works sooo i dont really worry to much. Truth is if we take away everything that could harm our children they would be living in plastic bubbles with no outside contact...lol. And i know what you mean about the category's i asked a pregnancy question and it said it should be in the politics.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Does binning & cussing the toys that, when you step on them by mis-take, and kill your feet with pain, count as keeping up to date? lol|`|AA12145826	Yep..."date" and "toy" sets if off.<br>  <br>  I'm probably not as up-to-date on the recalled toys as I should be, but then again I buy her more books and clothes than anything else it seems.|`|ysUg2Rgraa	I'm on about 8 e-mail lists on all toy stores,lol, singles & dating? They're not in the gutter, they're STUCK in there!|`|CyeYMaUuaa	Absolutely! Recalled food is another big thing to keep an eye out for.<br>  <br>  I think they tried to put this in S&D because of "date" or "toys" =]
XKYP0sGQaa	Whichever one you enjoy the most.|`|IxGa7mnGaa	Violin|`|AA11280073	They are very different instruments. Listen to violin and clarinet music and decide which one you prefer.|`|I64JOuMKaa	which do you like playing more?<br>  or if you already learned one you might wanna try the other one to see which one you like better?<br>  do any of your friends play the violin or clarinet? Ask them if its hard or not, and its really hard and you still like it you might consider taking it.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would rather take the violin, because well it's easier in my opinion and I hear the saxaphone is hard so the clarinet might be to.<br>  <br>  But its all up to you ! Good luck!|`|3765e3159658220a8cc965318bdc4e05aa	Toughie! I learned Clarinet in Junior High, I had fun... But I have always wanted to play Violin....<br>  <br>  I would choose Clarinet if I were you. :))) It's pretty fun, it has a nice sound and is pretty easy to play until you get to the high notes.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Clairenet. Violin's make me cringe :\|`|Uo0b2aShaa	Clarinet much more fun|`|5jQVj4Pfaa	In my school you can take both, but if you can't do that, it's really your choice. Clarinet takes wind-work and correct positioning, otherwise it squeaks. You also have the reed that you have to salivate on to make it wet and work properly. When I took orchestra, I played the violin, while a lot of my friends played the clarinet in band, so I'm trying not to sound too biased when I say I really liked playing the violin. All you had to do was take it out of the case, keep it tuned, and play the correct strings with correct fingers, as you have to do with the clarinet to play the right notes, only those are valves or... buttons. I'm not sure which, exactly. Either way, it's whatever you think would be easier on yourself and what you would enjoy more.|`|MgDWlJJcaa	both are great instruments. you move your fingers for both of them, but for violin you also move your arm. violin is a stringed instrument, it might hurt your fingers a bit. you may find it hard to get used to the clairnet positions to. there are a lot of holes with both of your hands covering them and you need to blow air. which one do you like better? i like them the same. its really your choice, no one can really tell you what you want...|`|tlEMsiHwaa	well which one do you know the most about, and id go with violin you can have the mot fun with that instument as i do with a guitar because all stringed instruments just own.|`|EdRzMi0Taa	violin|`|kk3kv0ePaa	clairenet|`|zX3Zv0Tgaa	take clarinet i really like it i have been playing it since 6th grade and i am in 9th!|`|nYioXmnGaa	DO not do clarinet I did it in middle school and hated it !!!!!!|`|siz5uRL3aa	Um I say violin it's fun!!
WCXCYNgRaa	Congratulations on your baby girl! My personal experience is very similar to yours. My first child is a boy, I was out working construction with my husband up until the 7th month, had tons of energy.  When I got pregnant with my daughter I was sick, nausea's and felt like crap. I gained a ton of weight and my diet changed drastically.  Honestly every pregnancy is different, but they do say girls are Trouble with a capital T.|`|mKUMsE5jaa	Im 26 weeks pregnant with my first child and i thought i was having a girl for similar reasons.  I found out at 20 weeks i was having a boy.  I used to love eating meat before i was pregnant, now i can't stand the taste or the smell of it and i eat tonnes of candy and chocolate.  I'm also very tired all the time. So i wouldn't get too excited about it because you may not be having a girl.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	Symptoms have nothing to do with   gender.<br>  <br>  I had a lot of energy in my entire pregnancy I couldn't eat much because I felt full quick.<br>  <br>  I had nausea from week 7 to week 14 just as my friend who had a boy and I had a girl.<br>  <br>  You're just wishing for a girl. All pregnancies are different.<br>  <br>  Congrats  :)|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Its impossible to tell. Just because your symptoms are different doesn't mean you're having a baby of the opposite sex then your first two. My sis in law had entirely different symptoms with her second and was convinced it was a girl, it ended up being another boy.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I am 50% sure it is a girl|`|8WbfmK5daa	This could just be a coincidence but Im 39 weeks pregnant with my little girl and I ve not been able to eat meat throughout my whole pregnancy! Its just not appealed to me in the slightest.<br>  <br>  I ve also been really tired as well right from the beginning but this my first pregnancy I ve had got nothing to compare it too so that might just be typical for me :)|`|jgtfWjE4aa	old wives tales are fun but there is NO truth to them.<br>  with every pregnancy you can feel totally different and have the same sex each time.<br>  you can go online and get a gender test...although i don't know how reliable they really are...<br>  <br>  or you can wait 10 more weeks.<br>  <br>  p.s you always have a 50/50 chance...|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	From what I've been told you'll crave meat if it's a boy and sugar if it's a girl. I wouln't go by this 100% but it was true for me.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	50% chance<br>  u would have more energy with ur frist coz ur not running around with a baby already, and since u have two boys to chase and u r pregnant ofcourse u r going to have less energy

Great names! I have a friend who named her daughter Adelynn but refuses to let anyone call her "Addie", which I think is so cute! I think Aubrielle will age much better so I pick this as my fav! It is so pretty. I have never heard it before so it's unique and I like unique names. Don't get scared, "unique" is not bad, it good. Aubrielle is not "weird" it's beautiful!

Even if she doesn't like it when she gets older she can always go with Monique. I know only 1 person with this name, and she's really nice. Not too popular.<br>  <br>  Margaret, is like jane. very plain, and the nickname is mags/maggie.<br>  <br>  don't worry about the kid gettingteased because of a name.

Other places have them for alot of money<br>  I'm not sure where you live, but im sure theres a Wal-mart<br>  near by somewhere, if not go to www.walmart.com<br>  and you can get it online<br>  my son loves it, and the toys are a great way to destract<br>  the baby from grabbing everything else in his reach.
8t8NjjnVaa	It really doesn't matter how you put him to bed as long as it's working out okay.  You don't necessarily have to be consistent unless getting him to sleep is a battle.  <br>  <br>  I never put my kids on a schedule, I figure they'd cry and then nurse when they were hungry and sleep when they're tired, which of course they did.  Sometimes they'd fall asleep in the swing, sometimes it was in the bouncer, sometimes it was while nursing, and sometimes it was just holding them.  <br>  <br>  Unless he's just a bear to get to sleep, there's no need to stick to one specific way.<br>  <br>  In fact, having several different ways of getting to sleep is probably best.  I mean, if he MUST have certain things to fall asleep, that sure would make going out or going on vacation really difficult!|`|0dwVWzLJaa	i think its good that you have different ways to get him to sleep because he will learn the difference to having a nap and going to bed, otherwise he might not know when hes meant to be napping and when its time for a long sleep, and i wouldn't advise giving a dummy at night my son used to have one and i had to get up about 5 times a night to give it him back i ended up having to take it off him altogether. but yeah i think you should have separate routines for day and night xx|`|njAD3U5Aaa	You need to whats best for your child. Everyone is different. I personally dont recommend having my child on a schedule where he is dependent on one thing or another to fall asleep. Possibly having him fall asleep differently for naps and bedtime might help him keep the two apart. Has its pros's & con's. But ultimately do what is best for your child and you.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I think if it works for you and him, then go with it! I wouldn't change the routine unless he is having problems with it. <br>  On the other hand it would be a lot easier to take a passy away from a nine month old then a two year old! I just took my daughters away 2 days ago, and she almost hit a girl in target yesterday trying to get the other girls passy! ( I caught her in time...)|`|UYnAASPJaa	if it works for you and your child then it is the perfect routine. lucky about the no paci at night i hated getting up digging for the lost thing in the middle of the night.. lol!!!

You have to make your mind up, would you want a child at your age?|`|NEkssyeAaa	I think you should take the pill|`|pU1fAci6aa	first of all if your 15 you shouldn't be having sex using a condom or not!<br>  <br>  take a pregnancy test and find out.|`|orcLWRp7aa	Your Screwd !|`|FuvMTGXzaa	I would take it just to be sure!! Better being safe than sorry.
Xrwvu5Uraa	At my first doctors appointment, I got weighed, urine sample, checked all my vitals, estimate of a due date from my last missed period, a PAP test, a blood sample, checked my tummy and breasts actually, they explain everything to you basically, so my first appointment was rather long. <br>  <br>  at the upcoming appointments you can expect to be having your belly be measured from the top of your pubic bone to your belly button, measuring your uterus. I give a urine sample everytime, get my blood pressure checked, and get weighed and my belly gets measured. oh and my doctor listens for the heartbeat every appointment I have too!<br>  <br>  around weeks 10-12 you will have an ultrasound and then again which is for the anatomy scan, shows how big the baby is and how much he/she approx. weighs and it's an anatomy scan, around weeks 18-22. (that is when you can find out the sex)<br>  <br>  at week 26-28 you will be giving blood again to test for gestational diabetes.<br>  <br>  once you hit around 30 weeks you will be going to the doctor every 2 weeks instead of once a month, and then it will increase to once a week when you are about 8 months.<br>  <br>  they may only do another ultrasound if something medically needs to be taken care of, it's rare to get more than two of them done.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	A PAP exam and checking for STDs. Also they will take a few blood samples. It won't be like a PAP every time.|`|AA11916244	First one you probably will get an exam so they can run the preliminary pap tests. You will be weighed and most drs will give you an ultrasound to date the pregnancy. And heads up it will be a vaginal ultrasound where they stick a wand up there. But dont worry it feels no different than putting in a tampon. You will get to see a little peanut with a heartbeat. Its so cute!! Regular check-ups you will get weighed and blood pressure taken. And then starting at around 12 weeks they will check the babys heartbeat. Then around 20 weeks you will get weight, blood pressure, heartbeat check, measure your stomach and then send you on your way.Trust me you'll get used to the routine pretty quick. Congrats|`|SVuYaK8maa	My sweet get the book what to expect.  It's a god sent.  Even if it's used still work's.  <br>  <br>  But mostly they will test your pee, blood, and belly.  They might do an ultra sound and might not.  They might try and hear the baby's hart beat and might not.  It also depends on the doc.  I was high risk for both my kid's and had to pee every time and give blood once a month.   As well as took ultra sound's all the time.  At least one a month.  Was great.<br>  Every one it different.  Mean's yours will be too. Oh yeah they do the normal stuff.  Ask them to tell you if your gaining weight to slow or fast.  That could be due to the sex.  Wife's tail.  Gain more weight fast it's a boy.|`|mKUMsE5jaa	Lots of books, and your asked lots of questions about your last period.  You also will get booked for a Pap Smear and will have to get a blood test done every month now, well, for some people anyways...|`|8WbfmK5daa	All that happened at my first doctor's appointment was he confirmed that infact I was pregnant, estimated my due date, and arranged my first scan.|`|28ux28S0aa	I don't think my first visit was even a gyno visit. They usually don't do that until later. Each of my first visits was actually a downer because it was so simple. They have you pee in a cup and then they confirm that you are pregnant and then do some measurements, tell you the due date etc. It is pretty hands off.|`|4CzhJUkOaa	Congratulations!!!! I had my first visit too, this week. My doc just did a pelvic exam and blood tests for HCG and progestrone levels... If you are not on prenatals already, ask for a prescription! Good luck!!! :)
TQW5E6olaa	You're not going to get the crack head down the street to di it with a dirty needle found in the gutter, you're going to a reputable <clean> shop. The only way I can see it affecting your breastmilk is through contamination with a needle, which shouldn't happen at a good shop.<br>  <br>  <br>  Remind me again, what it is?|`|01vMpHkWaa	i heard its fine<br>  its just on the first layer of your skin so dont worry<br>  <br>  i have one on my left breast and i asked my doctor if it would effect anything and she said nope|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Tattooing won't interfere with breast feeding and nothing will go thru the milk to the baby if that's what you're concerned about.  For the most part, the majority of the experts believe that there is no possible way that this can happen and that the idea is just ridiculous.  Of course, this is assuming you are NOT having your breast tattooed, but rather another body part. <br>  <br>  If you're having your breast tattooed, you should wait.  Because while the ink won't go thru to the child in the breast milk, the baby may have an allergic reaction to the ink (if his mouth or hands are touching new ink).  And you'd also be leaving yourself more open to infection at the tattoo site because of the activity your breast will be going thru while breast feeding.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind too, that while you're menstruating OR breast feeding, the pain in getting a tattoo can be a bit worse.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle/mom-activities.html#Tattoos" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle...</a><br>  Tattoos<br>  <br>  There is no evidence that getting a tattoo will affect breastfeeding. There should be no harm to mom or baby from the dyes injected. If you get a tattoo, the biggest concern for anyone (not just nursing moms) is infection (hepatitis or HIV)-- so make sure the place you go has good references and is clean. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org//FAQ/tattoos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org//FAQ/tattoos.html</a><br>  Is it safe to get a tattoo while breastfeeding?<br>  <br>  Tattoos are created by injecting ink into the dermal (second and third) layer of the skin. Tattooists use a hand-held electric machine that is fitted with solid needles coated in the ink. The needles enter the skin hundreds of times a minute to a depth of up to a few millimeters. The ink that is used in tattoos in the United States is subject to FDA regulation as cosmetics, but none are approved for injection under the skin. However, the ink molecules are too large to pass into breastmilk.<br>  <br>  General information about tattooing also applies to breastfeeding women. Local and systemic infections are the most prevalent risks of tattooing. Local infections can occur when the recommended aftercare regimen is not followed. Aftercare includes keeping the tattoo clean with mild soap and water, not picking at the scabs and keeping the tattoo out of the sun. Tylenol is often prescribed for the pain, if needed. Systemic infections occur when universal precautions are not followed by the tattoo artist and can include such diseases as hepatitis, tetanus and HIV.<br>  <br>  It is very important to screen the tattooist and the shop carefully, checking with the local health department for local laws and regulations. Professional tattooists will follow universal precautions such as sterilization of the tattoo machine using an autoclave, single-use inks, ink cups, gloves and needles, bagging of equipment to avoid cross contamination, and thorough hand washing with disinfectant soap. Most tattooists will not knowingly tattoo a pregnant or breastfeeding mother. It is suggested that mothers wait at least until the child's first birthday to give their bodies a chance to recover completely from childbirth before getting a tattoo.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	getting a tattoo while breastfeeding isnt going to hurt anything as long as you go to a clean reputable shop that uses clean needles. there is no way any ink will get into your blood stream or into your milk and get to the baby. it only goes into your skin!|`|MeYILJeSaa	<a href="http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVFebMar05p3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVFeb...</a><br>  <br>  :)|`|VGueFw4gaa	Did you know that if you get a tatoo you can't donate blood for a certain amount of time after?  I think it's 6 months or a year, don't remember.  Keep that mind.  If the red cross won't take your blood for a stranger, why consider possibly endangering your baby?<br>  <br>  For clarification, here's the entry from the Red Cross site.<br>  <br>  Tattoo<br>  Wait 12 months after a tattoo if the tattoo was applied in a state that does not regulate tattoo facilities. This requirement is related to concerns about hepatitis. Learn more about hepatitis and blood donation.<br>  <br>  Acceptable if the tattoo was applied by a state-regulated entity using sterile needles and ink that is not reused. There are 32 states that currently regulate tattoo facilities. You should discuss your particular situation with the health historian at the time of donation.

deIzFnV8aa	Your baby's favorite toy at this age is probably you!  In a month or so he will be able to grab and handle toys better, and be more independent about playtime.<br>  <br>  I have a 3 1/2 month daughter, and we spend a lot of time making faces at each other, watching the 'baby in the mirror" (a crib mirror can be good for this, or just the one in your bathroom), reading stories (board books and soft books that crinkle) and singing songs, or taking a bath  together in the "big girl bathtub". She loves to be held sitting while she tries to grab her blocks or rattles (and try and eat them, of course). She also enjoys batting at toys in her bouncer or that I hold.<br>  <br>  Some of her favorite toys are big soft blocks that rattle or chime, and the plastic links that you use to hang toys from carseats. The links are bright, rattle when shaken, and are perfect for little baby hand to grab. I link 3-4 together and we can play with them for hours (grab, drop, grab again, such on shake around, repeat).  Things that are easy to pick up and that make noise will be appreciated by this age.<br>  <br>  Another great toy for this age is the activity gyms with dangling toys. THey are kind of pricey, though - you can also dangle toys from under a chair or some such place.<br>  <br>  We also do a "mommy and baby fitness" DVD together, which my daughter enjoys a lot. You don't have to buy the DVD - just sit him on your tummy and blow on his face while you do situps, or do leg lifts where he can watch your feet go up and down. My DD loves watching wiggling fingers and toes.  Make funny noises while you stretch, or use baby (carefully!) as a barbell. Fun for baby and good for mommy's postpartum toning!<br>  <br>  Also, here is a great website for game ideas:<br>  <a href="http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/develop..." rel="nofollow">http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/develop...</a><br>  <br>  Babies don't seem to mind repeating activities fairly often, so don't worry if you don't have something new every day; he will just enjoy being with you some of the time, and playing in his chair when you need a break.|`|8dNCofeVaa	You never know if you are bored until you've tried these websites:<br>  <br>  1. <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.addictinggames.com</a> - one of the best free gaming websites that I have seen to date on the internet.

OuA2cQ8haa	wow some people really shouldn't be allowed to have kids|`|rAkWoweOaa	Sounds like my cousin's on agian off again girlfriend. She has 3 kids, then she got her tubes tied, but she got 900 a month food stamps and said she lived by herself to get assitance, but my cousin, her boyfriend makes $5500 a month. she claims them and they get a fortune back on income tax refund. So they get help on living, food, and everything else, and guess where they have lived for the past 5 yrs? With our grandfather, and they get money off of him because they spend it all up. Then they tell him they need help for the baby's medicine when everyone knows they are on medicaid and it is free. Ugh. I feel ya, but there is nothing you can do.|`|19JRf8Cxaa	Well, first off, I have a couple questions about this:<br>  Is she unemployed?<br>  Is she a single parent?<br>  I am going to answer the question thinking that she is for both of them, so sorry in advance is she is married and employed!<br>  <br>  Sit her down and have a talk with her. Tell her that having five young kids is a huge responsibility. Moving in with her grandfather is not an option. She has to make smart financial decisions in order to be able to pay for an apartment and eventually she will need a house. Tell her to get a job so she can pay for the little ones. Tell her that making stupid decisions about her money is going to literally be a tragedy when the kids get older. They are not going to be able to live in an apartment forever and definitely not at her grandfathers! If you know anything about money, offer to help her out. Help her look for a job, and once she gets her first pay check, help her spend the money wisely. And lastly, about once a month, offer to babysit her kids so she can go out and have some fun. Everyone deserves to have one night off every now and then, right?|`|CCqqTw6paa	sit her down<br>  and slap her as hard as you can<br>  <br>  try to knock some sense into her|`|eya1WDS4aa	I wouldnt say anything at all. her fault if she cant grow up and do what she needs to do for her kids then she doesnt deserve to have her kids. end of story.<br>  <br>  Okay let me clarify: i have already went threw this and i shouldnt have said a darn thing. keep your mouth shut and if you notice anything going horriably wrong with the kids contact cps.  If you talk to her about it its just gonna start a whole bunch of drama. been there done that and i dont want to go back. Your just gonna fight with her and she is just gonna tell you to mind your own bussiness and that how she raises her kids is up to her. So really skip the drama and just report her if things get out of hand.|`|yKLBdoigaa	TALK to her about it. Everything you just posted above is a great start, you have to be honest. Out of all the people to hear it from, your the best, as much as she may say different, you can be gentle and persuading. If she doesn't listen than I'm really sorry to say, you should report her. That is wrong of her, and especially the going out drinking part makes me sick.|`|EayT8T5Gaa	omg IM SORRY TO HEAR THIS BUT THIS IS A REALLY SAD STORY THERE'S A LOT OF SINGLE MOM'S OUT THERE NOT LEAVING OFF FOOD STAMP, WELFARE, SECTION 8 AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF FROM THE STATE AND GOVERNOR, C'MON SHE NEEDS TO GET HER ACT TOGETHER AND TAKE CARE OF HER KIDS AND STEP UP HER GAME. SHE'S 23 AND SHE HAS 5 KIDS SHE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HER KIDS AND NOT PARTYING AND DRINKING, YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN WITH  HER AND TALK TO HER! AND JUST EXPLAIN TO HER THAT IS SHE DOESN'T GET HER ACT TOGETHER THE STATE WILL TAKE HER KIDS AWAY.

Sometimes I add a jar of pureed cauliflower or squash to my son's mac n cheese.  You can hide pureed food in most anything...even desserts like brownies!  Find something in a similar color scheme that won't change the taste too much and sneak it in.  But even when you do that I would put veggies on the tray for him.  He may not eat them but keep offering and one day he will pick one up and eat it.  Just don't make a big issue out of it.  Good luck!|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Steamed, chopped broccoli can be added to grilled cheese or mac n cheese. You could try a chicken, broccoli and cheese casserole. Campbell broccoli/cheese soup has a great recipe on the label.<br>  Minced carrots in your meatloaf or meatballs, will make it super moist...its really good. my 2 yo loves it. She also loves anything with ranch dressing. Especially home grown tomatoes chopped w/ ranch dressing. She'll also eat more of her veggies when I use them in fried rice. She doesn't care for snow peas, but if I throw some in stir fry them and add to fried rice...she'll eat them.<br>  I did the same as Lola, from the beginning I never offered the sweet stuff. I wanted my girl to get a taste for the veggies 1st and enjoy them. I didn't add the fruits in until way later. And when I did, I always cut the sweetness with cereal.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Be the parent, sit him down and tell him he cant get up until he eats them.<br>  <br>  okay so he is only one my son is 22 months old and was eatting veggies since before he was one.

Before he can have seconds of a favorite item, he must eat the vegetable that is served.  If he tries it and spits it out, then I still serve it, but do not make him eat it.  Sometimes he eats his veggies better if I feed him, he is almost 2 1/2.  My older son loved broccoli with ketchup and would ask for that as a snack.  My little one won't eat beets and clearly says he doesn't like them, so I do not force it.  The rule for both boys is, eat what you have before seconds.

Some of the babies who might benefit include:<br>  <br>      * a newborn (or older adopted baby) trying to figure out how to breastfeed<br>      * a previously-weaned baby whom you wish to breastfeed again<br>      * a baby who seriously resists nursing (or even being placed in a nursing position)<br>      * a baby with nipple confusion<br>      * a baby who is a fussy nurser (but does not completely refuse the breast)<br>      * a baby on a nursing strike<br>  <br>  Even if you have a baby who adamantly resists nursing, getting your baby to breast is very possible but it will probably require time, patience, and kangaroo-style frequency. Expect "two steps forward and one step backward."<br>  <br>  If you're getting discouraged working with your non-nursing baby, read this: My Baby Just Doesn't Get It. If you have a newborn who is not latching on, do keep in mind that almost all reluctant nursers will start latching by four to eight weeks of life. <br>  <br>  ------------<br>  Nursing Through Confusion<br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/bf/confusion.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/b...</a><br>  <br>  "My Baby Just Doesn't Get It"  <br>  <a href="http://www.normalfed.com/Help/babyget.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.normalfed.com/Help/babyget.ht...</a><br>  There are lots of reasons why a baby can't seem to get the hang of latching on and nursing well at first. While your baby learns how, you need to: 1) keep him fed, 2) keep your milk supply going, 3) keep in touch with breastfeeding specialists... and 4) keep the faith! Your baby will learn how. These babies did.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVFebMar01p3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVFe...</a><br>  I remarked that she shouldn't give up on baby Brian, but try putting him to the breast once each day. Perhaps baby Brian would grow strong enough or perhaps his mouth would grow big enough so that he would be able to handle actually taking the breast. I remarked that she'd have nothing to lose and who knows, some day he just might decide that he was ready.<br>  <br>  Imagine my surprise when about five months later, I received a call from the triplet mother saying that she had been continuing to pump and breastfeed and spending a few minutes each day allowing Brian to fool around at one breast while she was pumping on the other. Excitedly she told me, "Today he just took the breast and nursed as if he'd known how to all along." His gestational age was just over three months and he finally figured it out. This was such a wonderful story and I was so happy to get that call - it made my week.

A simple way to do this is to use fresh milk from fridge through most of work week, and then once or twice a week thaw a bag or two of frozen milk. You can freeze a bag or two of freshly pumped milk to replace what frozen you've used.  This keeps your stock "rotated" and still allows baby to have bulk of milk be fresh milk.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Pump as often as the baby eats on the opposite breast he's nursing on if you can. <br>  <br>  Deep Freezer- 6 months<br>  freezer with separate door as fridge for 3 months<br>  Once thawed in the fridge for 24 hours<br>  Never refreeze frozen and thawed milk.|`|w3ob12X6aa	you can keep milk frozen for up to 3 months in the freezer i read it in a book and to thaw it out just get a cup and fill it with hot water and let it sit in there until warm DO NOT microwave it can also sit for about 6-7 hrs|`|eEhTBxT7aa	This is a wonderfull website for breast feeding moms.

teDI6RQ8aa	My second dog hasn't been around kids since we got him, but my first one is scared of kids until she learns to trust them.  Gender doesn't matter to her.<br>  <br>  I haven't noticed any difference as far as the behavior.  If anything, girls are usually more reserved, and boys more rough in general, not just with dogs.  Girls have a maternal nature.|`|Nsh3lVDPaa	You are very sexist. Imagine me saying my dog hates a certain race. I would get a violation. Sexism is just as bad as racism.|`|AA12145826	Ok, you have to keep in mind that you're talking about children who haven't been raised around your dogs or possibly ANY dogs, so I think that might be the biggest thing you need to factor in here. Chances are any child you have, regardless of sex, will learn proper respect for all animals by the examples you provide.<br>  <br>  As far as other people's children, its okay for you to say "oh, I'm sorry, but the doggy doesn't like to be touched by strangers" or even "you can pet the doggy, but you have to be very quiet and really nice when you touch him/her."|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	i guess it just depends<br>  <br>  my dog hates men. any man or boy that comes to our house that he does not know, she will try to bite. it's really weird. if you think the dog will be aggresive toward your baby, you might want to consider getting rid of it. however, the baby will grow up around the dog so they might be ok around each other... just  give it a try i guess|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I dont know many little girls who really have a lingering intrest in my dog, but little boys never want to stop and are so rough wanting to pull on the dog. and roll all on the floor.

I think it depends if they are around animals alot.|`|FsoqGsjbaa	As far as it goes with having your own kids, it probably won't matter because by the kid is old enough to terrorize your dog they will probably have accepted them into the family.<br>  <br>  My parent's dog (a chihuahua) is pretty aggressive.  She doesn't like little kids at all and she growls at people all the time.  I stayed with my parents for my daughter's first three months and I was worried about this.  When I brought her home, my parent's dog showed no aggression.  The only change I noticed was that she avoided my baby.  If we brought Lizzie to close to the dog, the dog would run away like she was afraid.|`|ss3ZU4KCaa	A lot of it is the child's individual personality. My sister and i have been around animals our whole life and therefore were taught how to act around animals. Even ones that are aggressive to start with, such as owls and raptors. My two dogs are actually more stressed around little boys. Part of that might be that my i sometimes baby-sit my friend's daughter and my God-daughter and they are used to seeing girls. It may be that your dogs are just not used to seeing little girls. Another thought is that they sense you're worried (that the little girls will upset them), and that will upset them by itself. Dogs' personalities are as different as people, so i'd say just keep your eyes open for any warning signs if you're around a lot of children.
OgzHcNMsaa	I REALLY wanted a boy too. When I got pregnant I was convinced it was a boy. I would call it him and was just so excited. When I had my 18 week ultrasound and they said it was a girl, I was sooooooooo disappointed. My husband even said he's never seen me so sad. HOWEVER, now that I have a girl, I LOVE her so much. She's my world and I can't see myself with a son. She's so beautiful and shopping for girls is so much more fun. Regardless of what you have though, you will  love it amazingly.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I couldn't see myself with a girl either I have always wanted boys and thankfully God gave me what I wanted! :)  Not that I wouldn't have been completely satisfied with a girl and I would have loved her and dressed her like a princess!  But I am so thrilled to be having boys! :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  But I wouldn't consider myself a tomboy or anything like that I love getting my hair done and dressing up I have just always had a desire for boys :)|`|VHHis05Naa	I can't imagine myself with a son, but if this one is a boy, I know I will adjust.  And so will you!  My daughter likes to play outside with our dog and her BFF is a little boy.  My friend's son likes to play with dolls.  So you really don't know what kind of kid you'll get!<br>  <br>  That being said, I do hope you get your boy.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If you're a woman, you were once a little girl - who didn't care for any of that stuff.  Your daughter will more then likely be more like you then other little girls, it's unlikely she will be total girl.   Heck, even if you end up with a boy, who says he won't like Barbies, the color pink, and dressing up?|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	I always felt like you.  I was a tom-boy growing up.  Never played with dolls, always liked cars, riding bikes, and playing with the boys in the neighborhood when i was growing up.  Naturally, I wanted a "healthy baby", isn't that what everyone says?  But secretely, i dreaded having a girl.  I didn't know how to relate to them.  Professionally, i'm a speech therapist and i tend to work mostly with preschool boys.  I know what little boys like and how to play with them.  Little girls make me nervous...playing dress-up, house, dolls....yuck!  So fast forward, i'm pregnant....my husband and i are thrilled.  At about 20 weeks, we find out the sex....it's a girl.  The first words i said was, "you're lying!".  But it was a girl.  Once i got used to the idea, we were able to choose a name, decorate the nursery (oh yeah, all pink...a color i always hated!), bought clothes.  Funny, the more i thought of the baby (and my belly) as "she" instead of "it", the more ok i was with having a girl.  By the time she was born, i had forgotten that i was "upset" with having a girl.  When the doctor placed her on my belly just seconds after she was born, she opened her eyes and looked at me.  It was amazing.  So, here we are now.....2 years later.  I have (gulp) a girly-girl.  She loves her dolls.  carries them everywhere.  we have toy strollers and high chairs so she can take care of them.  I can't imagine having any child other than the beautiful one i have.  <br>  <br>  As for you.....all will be forgotten when you hold your daughter (if you have a daughter)....if you find out the sex ahead of time, all will be forgotten even sooner.  You can still play cowboys and indians, cops and robbers, go outside, etc with a girl.  That's what i do with my daughter.  It's just that when we play, her dolls have to come along.  and that's ok.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Once you find out the gender of your baby, it won't matter. <br>  <br>  I kinda had my heart set on having a girl, but I found out I had a boy and I was equally excited.  Now I couldn't imagine having any other baby then my son.  <br>  <br>  No need to stress, you will love your child with all your heart and be super excited no matter what gender it maybe.|`|POGZZmoUaa	I too, wanted only boys and that's what I got.  My son wanted a boy and we both were surprised with a precious little girl.  He can't imagine life without her and neither can I.  She is the most fun to play with and do dress-up, make-up and pretend princesses.  I didn't even know raising my boys, that girls could be so fun. Sawyer Lee could be a cute girls name, too.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	i have to say i never thought i enjoy  having a step daughter and i'm a goth  not girl at all i hate pink yet my really enjoy taking my step daughter to her battle as when i see her smile it makes me happy <br>  u be the same so don't stress you will find she would be u world girly girl or tom boy lol|`|bNeL6Lftaa	yes you may want a boy not a girl you like to do all these thing out side. if your girl grows up doing these things you wont get a girlie girl. or if you do so what. when you hold that baby and look into its eyes you heart will melt either way. and i am sure you heard this one, just pray for a health baby.|`|1S7uXsInaa	I could never imagine myself with a son, but once it happens you can not imagine it any other way!|`|5DJcir9saa	Honestly, once you find out that its healthy, you won't care what gender it is.  I was hoping for a girl, but the minute I found out I was having a boy, I didn't care.  I was just glad that everything looked okay and he was healthy.  And just remember...you're a girl and you enjoy doing "typical guy things" so don't you think your daughter would be the same way?  And don't feel bad.  My friend feels the same way you do.  She is definitely not a girly girl and she fears that she will have a girly girl that she cannot relate to.  But if your daugther isn't exposed to really girly things, then she most likely wouldn't turn out that way (at an early age at least!)|`|ZZhEmJNmaa	I was the son my dad always wanted...lol...and I'm not a boy! :)<br>  <br>  I always went hunting, fishing, etc with him. <br>  <br>  I now have a daughter and it's the best! There are so many cute things for girls and not as much for boys...lol. She's the best thing that could have happened to me! I don't know what I'd do with a boy! My husband still wants a boy..but I'm not even sure if I want another child. I'm getting the Merena on Wed and we'll see from there!<br>  <br>  Good luck in whatever you get!|`|dpPqH7BAaa	I thought the SAME EXACT thing. I thought I was having a boy, I only wanted a boy, never a girl. I thought I wouldn't be able to feel the same way about a daughter. At my ultrasound they said it was a girl and all of the sudden my heart instantly changed. I suddenly had this new love I never thought I could feel. When you look and see your baby girl for the first time and realize she is yours, and a part of you, you will fall absoloutly in love and wonder how you could ever have felt differently.|`|wUfZJvbUaa	OMG, i know exactly what you're talking about.. i'd always like more Masculine activities too.. even when i was younger, i used to play with balls, cars and planes, i only had one doll and it was  a boy! i had two younger brothers and got along with them just fine.. i thought i could never handle girls, i wouldn't really know how to dress them and what plays to play with them.. now i've got two children, both girls :) :) they are the cutest ever and i actually love dressing them in girly little outfits... my second is only 8mo so it's hard to say, but my older one (29 mo) is actually really girly! it's really cute to watch her pick her clothes (skirts and dresses mostly) and want to do her hair! <br>  trust me, once you have a  girl, you learn to play along and you'll have fun doing it.. i'm sure you'll enjoy it just as much if it were a boy.. really, there is  no difference, you'll love him/her and try to do your best either way.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	My family is full of girls, i thought i would end up with a daughter the first time i was pregnant and was i guess disappointed whan the ultrasound said boy. I was feeling pretty bad about it, i worried i wouldn't have anything in common with a boy, but God knows what he does, i couldn't imagine my life without him now. So don't feel bad, you are still going to be a mom one way or the other and in the end that's what matters. Best of luck!|`|rDPADat1aa	You'll likely still be upset at first when the ultrasound tech says, "well, it's a girl!"  It'll take some time to adjust, but you will.  Whatever God gives you is who is right for your family, whether you think so or not.  I always thought I'd have 2 boys and 2 girls, but I found out on New Year's Eve that I'm having my third boy, not my second girl.  I was shocked but got over it.  Now I can't wait to meet my newest little boy!<br>  <br>  Good luck TTCing.  Baby dust to you!|`|xOhxb6jAaa	I always thought I only wanted boys too.  I didn't want to go through the nasty teenage girl stage - I know I was no fun at that age. I've also always been more of a tomboy - playing sports, getting dirty, etc.  I was never into the girly stuff - makeup, dressing up, cheerleading, etc. I don't know that I felt quite as strong about it as you, but if I could have chosen I always thought I wanted a boy.  My DH and i TTC for 4 years and when it finally happened, lo and behold we had twins!  I found out the gender of the first baby at about 13 weeks - it was a BOY!  I was thrilled!  Everything I had hoped for.  I was hoping #2 was another boy.  At 18 weeks another ultrasound revealed that baby #2 was a  GIRL!   I lucked out and got the best of both worlds.  My twins are 9 months old now and I can tell you that I wouldn't trade my baby girl for the WORLD!  I absolutely can not believe that there was a time that I didn't want a little girl.  Of course, I love my little boy more than life itself too.  I'm still not quite sure what I'll do if my little girl ends up wanting to be a cheerleader, but I'm sure I'll love every second of whatever she decides to be involved in.  To end my very long story, I think you will be happy whether you end up with a boy OR a girl.  Once you get pregnant you realize the only truly important thing is that you end up with a healthy baby.  Good luck!
eJ539ejpaa	When we moved our son he was 16 months.  We just did the same bedtime routine for him.  We started with naps and then nighttime.  It took a few nights, but once I read a book about sleeping in a big boy bed, he never turned back.  His crib was still up as his baby brother was going to be using it.  <br>  When his brother transitioned last year, it was the same.  We kept the bedtime routine and he had not problems.  They both have a blanket and cuddle toy they use to sleep with and as long as they have it, they will sleep anywhere.  <br>  Neither one ever used a toddler bed.  <br>  One thing I did learn, is do not play in the bed trying to make it fun, because we tried that and our son thought at first the bed was a fun place, not used for sleeping.  <br>  You may want to have her pick out the sheets.  We use only a fitted sheet and save the flat sheet for necessary changes.|`|IpXzFGEAaa	I put the toddler bed into her room for about a month before even trying so she could get used to it being there and such.  Then she would sit on her bed and play or read or put her dolls to bed in it during the day.  Then when moving day came, we went to the store and bought new sheets, blankets, pillow cases and comforter that she liked (seasame street).  She couldnt wait to go to bed!!|`|h93SVSxLaa	Make it exciting, a big deal, she's a big girl in a big girl bed now. Plastic mattress protectors are the best thing in the world!!! put pillows on the floor the first few nights cause she might toss and turn a little other than that just let her know it's exciting and you can use it for learning tools for other "big moves" good luck|`|6RGnG1ukaa	Make the whole process exciting. Repeat your self saying that she is a big girl moving into a big bed. Plastic mattress cover is the best idea for young children. The main idea is that for about a week say "Aren't you excited you moving into a big girl bed?" and " Are you ready to move into a big girl bed?". Make the whole thing exciting and happy!|`|nuBRcuwvaa	My son slept on the mattress on the floor for a couple months first.  He got used to the idea of being out of the crib, but wasn't scared of falling.<br>  Then we moved the mattres up to the bed and he did great.  He has never rolled out of the bed.<br>  We did all of this between 13-18 months, so I'm sure your daughter can handle it.  Make it fun, and a special treat.|`|OpVysSzQaa	my boys (one so far, the other is too young) go into toddler beds shortly after their first birthday. its easy, they get all excited about having a bed boy bed, not realise they can get in and out at their own will, and just buy one with a rail on it, or buy a rail. until they get the hang of it. or you could cover the floor with pillows around the bed until she starts getting the idea that rolling around too much in bed is a bad idea. make sure you get one that is appropriate for her size. my boys are big, and I think I should've just put my oldest in a twin right away.|`|Rhn3Q9Yuaa	Ah....always a toughie.  The best solution, i have found, is to talk to her.  Tell her that now she is a big girl so she gets to sleep in her big girl bed.  Don't say words like have to or need to.  They don't work well with kids.  Make her feel like she earned it.  If they think they're getting a prize they'll do pretty much anything.  Also, try the reward system and stick to your routine.  Don't change her nighttime ritual.  when it's time for her to go to sleep act like its a big deal that she GETS to sleep in this big bed.  <br>  <br>  Don't cave, however, if she starts crying or throwing fits.  This could happen and the best response is, once she's in bed, you kiss her goodnight and leave the room.  If she starts crying try to ignore it.  Let her cry for 10 minutes, go in kiss her, tell her its time for bed and then leave.  Don't stay any longer than 2 minutes.  The next time let her cry for 20 minutes and so on.  You may not get very much sleep but she will get used to it and you will be ok.|`|nYioXmnGaa	Try and put er in the crib for a while and put  something she really likes to play with in it  so  she knows  that it is not that  scary .

8XcRFF6Taa	Definitely a 10!  But the hurting doesn't end there:(  Everyone neglected to tell me about "the poop" apparently after having a baby you intestines get all messed and the first time you go #2 will hurt sooo bad(i cried), make sure you take all the stool softeners they will give you in the hospital.  I think my milk coming in was almost as bad as labor, I'm an A  cup and with in a few hours I grew to a D!  They looked so good but OMG don't touch them:(  I put cabbage leaves and hot compresses on them, it didn't work, I couldn't even sit up straight they hurt so bad!  Oh and if you get stitches it will burn when you pee for the first few days and UTI's are common after childbirth.  All and all I would do it again in a heart beat!  I love my babies:)<br>  <br>  **Not trying to scare you just inform you!  Wish someone would have warned me:) lol|`|j3vOWiPUaa	11. most painful thing EVER! but after you are holding your child in your arms, you totaly forget about the pain. It is well worth it|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	10 but worth the end result and if u cant cope take pain relief <br>  if it was that bad we wouldnt have more than 1 baby x x|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Well, it hurts, a lot.  But the pain increases gradually, so you sorta adjust to the increase during early labor.  Also, you get a break between contractions, so early on, when the contractions are farther apart, you just have to last through that one contraction and then you're fine again.  <br>  <br>  The real challenge starts once the contractions are coming harder and faster.  I got epidurals with my first two, but went completely unmedicated with my third.  (All my labors were induced as well, so that makes contractions more difficult.  Labor is also harder once your water is broken.  Until my water was broken, I only had pain at a level of maybe 2-3, if that.)<br>  <br>  With my third, I almost got the epidural because I was in so much pain, and I was so tired.  When I sat down, I felt like my hips were going to just break open because of the pain/pressure.  My midwife asked me to try waiting another 30 minutes and to get in the shower.  I stood hunched over in the shower, with my arms holding my upper body up on the shower seat.  My midwife ran the shower spray back and forth against my lower back.  Yes, it still hurt, but the pain was much more manageable.  I didn't say a word the entire 45 minutes I was in the shower (until right before I got out).  Instead I just stood there, breathing deeply and softly moaning during each ctx.  When I got too tired to stand any longer, I told my midwife I was getting out after 3 more ctx.  When I got out and finally got in bed, I was 8-9cm dilated and almost ready to push.  The pushing was actually a relief b/c it gave me something to do, and I could work with the pain.  The hardest part when it came to pushing was that I had to go slow so that I wouldn't tear.  When the baby was crowning, I did scream, and I yelled at everyone to "Please shut up!" because I couldn't concentrate with them all talking.  The pain of crowning, though, was so short-lived in the grand scheme of things ,and once the baby was out, all the pain was gone.  It was amazing.  <br>  <br>  I completely recommend a natural birth (even though it's painful) and hiring a doula to help you manage the pains of labor.  It's an amazing experience, and my recovery was so much better than my c-section and my epidural vaginal delivery.  I would take one day of labor pain over weeks of recovery pain any day.<br>  <br>  Oh, and my first bowel movement didn't hurt after my 3rd either.  I don't know if it's b/c I didn't get the epidural or b/c I didn't have many stitches or simply b/c I made an effort to eat more fruits/veggies toward the end of my pregnancy and after delivery.  Regardless, I had none of the problems that I'd had the first two times.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|c2uywBsIaa	My friend had a baby and we had a conversation yesterday about the pain.<br>  She says "you know how they say you forget the pain as soon as you see the baby"<br>  I say "yeah"<br>  She says" I love baby luke, but they were lying...I'll never forget that pain, it hurt like a son of a *****"<br>  so there is your answer.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	1-2.<br>  <br>  It hurts about 1/8 as much as tearing a ligament in your ankle.<br>  <br>  It hurts about 1/100 as much as getting hit in the face with a baseball bat on a back swing from hitting a ball<br>  <br>  It hurts way less then the period pains I had in highschool<br>  <br>  I've had two with no drugs, at all.  The second at home and the midwife didn't even make it.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	10 <br>  a whole damn lot <br>  the baby comming out of ur vag|`|TEE4sJscaa	It hurts, but true contractions come and go at a constant rate. As your labor progresses the contractions become stronger and occur closer together. At first the pain was about 4 out of 10. But later as my contractions became stronger, the pain progressed until it was about a 10. <br>  <br>  You also may want to think about how quickly you can reach a hospital. Since my labor contractions were close together, there wasn't any time for pain medication such as an epidural. It also depends on how far your pelvis dilationn has come as well. I forget how dilateded you have to be, but at a certain point you have to start pushing the baby out. At that point, any pain medication you are given will be stopped, so that the baby has a chance to recover from it. Because the nurses will test the baby's reactions right after you give birth. <br>  <br>   Also don't forget to make sure you ask the doctors to dim the main lights while giving birth and remember to bring a packed diaper bag with formula and extra blankets. It will be cold in the hospital.|`|4iXL4C6paa	It guess it really depends on the woman, I had four children and the pain was seriously like nothing I have ever felt, during my first labor I was just wishing someone would knock me ( I was to far along for an epidural), the contractions are definitely the worst part, pushing the babies out was a breeze compared to the contractions but after my second one I pretty much got my breathing down, and the last two were not as bad (but still bad lol)....I would have to get labor a big 10|`|Xc02z608aa	It actually isn't as bad as some women make it out to be.  In all honesty, the worst part is when all you want to do is push and the doctor says no.  The panting and blowing really sucks.  On a scale of 1-10, I give it an 8.  Mine really wansn't that bad.  I didn't even take anything except for the gas.  Just take things one contraction at a time and you'll do great.|`|1S7uXsInaa	17.

I had a 25 hr labor and it was so bad I was crying and pulling my hair out because I had to get my contractions harder since I wasn't dialating wide enough to give birth. Provoked contractions are a million times worse then natural ones. That had to be the worse part of the labor but once I finally excepted the epideral I felt much better. I finally was able to relax and dialate. Then at 10:25 on Feb. 9, 2008 I had my beautiful gorgeous baby boy Anthony. Who was born with blue eyes, light brown hair with highlights, and red hot lips. He was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. It was totally worth the pain.|`|1i2HuDqmaa	Did it hurt? Hell yes!<br>  The contractions weren't too bad till right near the end, but the pushing was terrible. I felt like i couldn't even do it and wanted to give up. But as soon as the baby is out the pain all disappears. I only had the gas, but next time i think i'll have an epidural. I said no to it this time because i wasn't in that much pain, but by the time the pain was excruciating it was too late to have it and i wanted it.|`|UiBslwUPaa	it's different with every birth. my first was fine i did it without pain meds and the only bad part was the feeling that i was going to throw up every time i moved. but with my son 3 years later i thought i was going to die. and the epidural didn't work all the way. as soon as the baby was out the pain was gone though. it all depends on the size of the baby too my first was 7 10 and me second was 9 6. <br>  <br>  this is going to soung gross as hell but it kinda feels like you have to take a giant dump when you are pushing the baby out|`|RyWeizIlaa	I used Hypnobabies (hypnosis for childbirth program) with my last birth and it felt like menstrual cramps at first and then when my water broke it felt like really intense pressure, like when you get your blood pressure taken and it squeezes really tight.  <br>  <br>  With the birth before this one, I didn't use Hypnobabies and it was painful.  But it is hard to really judge it.  <br>  <br>  If I have another baby I will use Hypnobabies again!  <br>  <br>  I have gathered over 200 birth stories of moms who used hypnosis for their births at www.pregnancybirthandbabies.com|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	I was 18 yrs old at the time I had my son. He weighed 9lbs and 6oz. i was in labor for 36 hours!  They wanted to see if he turned around first before doing a c-section. I screamed so bad that the sides of my mouth ripped. They gave me something to help me sleep during contractions but when it came time to birth him, Oh God!!! I ripped all the way down to my rectum. I was ripping faster than the doctor could cut. I was swollen all over and could not move after I had him. But once I seen his face, the pain was all worth it. I was never able to have any more children. But, yes, it is very painful.|`|5bc904f09d573b29371603dab0caa809aa	The contractions that I experienced at home & on the way to the hospital was the worst part.  Those contractions were very painful.   I asked for the epidural as soon as I got to the hospital.  Once I had the epidural, I was more exhausted than I was in pain.|`|bc9inzicaa	You know that cliche about forgetting the pain once you hold your baby...so very true.  <br>  <br>  My water broke at 430 am and i had my son at 1014 pm the same day.  He weighed 10 lbs 7 oz and once he came out, you do forget about the pain and labor.  Do not get me wrong, while i was in labor the pain was excruciating; but, honestly everything seemed like a blur to me until about 10 minutes after his birth--had him without any pain meds.|`|I4a8zI1gaa	a scale of 1 - 10 is not even applicable to giving birth.  that scale has to extend to at least 100... and on that scale, it would probably be 101. <br>   lol... but i want another one and had epidural complications so i felt EVERYTHING... so you forget easily :) it's all worth it|`|TLjNUJHLaa	I had a epidural and still felt the pressure of the contractions.

CKnHMYHnaa	Multiple eggs are removed from a womans ovaries and combined with males sperm in a petri dish/test tube.   Once fertilization is achieved, the eggs are put inside of the womans uterus.  Not all the eggs 'stick' so mulitple fertilized eggs are implanted.  Sometimes none work and somtimes more than one works.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	The invitro procedure involves a lot of steps.  The first is blood work for hormone levels, blood chemistry's to be sure that all is well.  Semen analysis for the guys.  <br>  If all of that is good they begin treating the woman with hormones in the form of pills, patches and shots.  These are taken on a daily basis and it requires a lot of discipline.  the hormone is given stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs.  Some women produce many and others few.  They like to get at least 10 but more than 20 can cause over stimulation health issues.  They insert a needle into the ovaries to retrieve the eggs when they are mature.  Once retrieved they are fertilized with the sperm and allowed to grow to between 3-5 days. (some may be froze right after fertilization for future use).  They then determine how many will be transferred back to the woman.  over 35 they recommend up to 5 usually.  Younger women around 3.  Some Doctors may do more.  It is also possible for the eggs to divided into identical twins. ex: 2 eggs transferred and 3 babies delivered. <br>  <br>   Hope this answers your question.

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	I think the more diversity you have in you friends as you are growing up, the bigger your perspective is an adult.  You learn early that no matter what race, color, religion or other thing a person is, we all have common factors to us (like we all bleed the same color blood, we all get our feelings hurt and so learn to be gentle with each other, we all love and learn and make mistakes and live).  And that a person's religion or ethnicity or income level or shoe size doesn't determine whether you like them or not.  You also get to learn a lot about the things that are different from you--might get to experience what going to someone else's religious ceremonies are like, like eating the foods from their culture, like how their family gatherings may differ from your own.  It expands your mind (as the hippies used to say) and expands your world.  I think it's a good thing to expose kids to other kids that are "different" from them so they can learn they aren't so very different and you can love someone even with, or even because of, all the differences.  Makes you a bigger, fuller person.|`|a8IRxC4raa	I don't care what race my child's friend are.<br>  <br>  As to religion, it depends.  Fundamentalists teach their kids all kinds of things that are simply not going to make a friendship with my child work.  So while the religion itself would not matter, I don't want my child trying to be friends with someone who thinks they have a right to try and convert my child, or someone who thinks he/she is superior to my child, or someone who has parents who believe my child should be dead.<br>  <br>  Al the best.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I think that man had his head up his you know what. Friends are friends i dont care if they are purple. I would never tell my child that he/she couldnt be friends with someone because of what color their skin is or what religion they believed. Unless the friend was a bad influence on my child i would welcome anyone to be my childs friend.|`|s6emVQleaa	Considering my daughter is a little bit of everything- no.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	Absolutely not. My parents adopted nearly all of their children, and their children are hispanic, white, black, and asian. I could care less about what color my children are (I plan on adopting as well) and I could certainly couldn't not care any less about what race or religion their friends are. In fact, I want them to meet as many different kinds of children as possible. I think it's fantastic to see different people and different ways or life. There is absolutely no point, except for plain sillyness to not want your children to meet other children of different races or religions.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	That's just awful. No, it doesn't matter one hoot what race or religion kids are. And no, it doesn't matter that my son has friends of different races. Race is nothing but a skin color and religion is only what church you go to. And you know what? God doesn't care what church you go to or even IF you go. And I"m a Catholic saying that. People like that make me sad. And angry. They don't get it. That's where all the hatred and fighting come from in this world. poor kid. Judged by something she didn't even do. She's better off without people like that.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Thats pretty extreme. <br>  I do not care what race or religion my kids friends are really. There have been issues though when my son had friends whose parents were really religious and that religion was 'opposed' to our religion. In a few instances they made rude/offensive comments to my son about his beliefs. In that case it would be a huge problem but until something like that occurs I don't care.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	No I dont care. <br>  My son (his 6 and hes white and hispanic) is friends with a black boy next door( well actually with several black kids and also white kids) and at martin luther king day they had to write up stuff about him and we researched it and I dont think he ever really understood why he made the ' I have a dream' speech etc. He just cant even imagine not being friends with someone because of their skin color.<br>  As for religion, as long as they are not fundamentalist- anything or try to push their religion to my kids, I dont care|`|PRzmwFfgaa	My son at 7 is pretty unaware of race.  He goes to a Christian school but I don't care about his friends being outside of his race or religion.  That guy is an idiot for thinking that he can keep his daughter in a hole all of her life and never let her experience that there are other races and cultures in the world.|`|rAkWoweOaa	I don't care about race, but I don't want my kids socializing with atheists. Sorry if that makes someone mad, but that is just my truthful opinion.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	As long as my kids aren't hanging out with Satanist or gangsters, I'm fine. Race means nothing and religion means nothing when it comes to who my kids can be friends with.|`|prqrQcd1aa	No, it doesn't to me... but it may to some other people, sad really.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	I don't care about race or religion just so long as the other child respects boundaries in regards to the latter. If my kids come to me and say someone has been pushy to them about religion or trying to get them to go to a church, I would not let my kids have them over or go to their houses. Not much I can do about in-school, but some kids are parrots for their parent's religion, and I don't want my girls hearing and believing some of the verbal diarrhea that comes from these baby bible basher children of neo-cons.|`|lnnwXsdsaa	It does not matter to me. The thought doesn't even cross my mind when I see my kids playing with others. I think the father you are speaking of should put his kids in private school if he is that picky about who they associate with! It's really sad for the kids because they do not understand!|`|sVdCGwIUaa	Not at all!! that's just horrible to do something like that! what does it matter what race you are? i think its great that everyone is mixing and is normal! its who we are!|`|hNr3GFvlaa	It would matter to people who believe that race (ethnicity) and religion are the defining factor of who a person is.<br>  <br>  I am not one of these people.|`|swL7bQfAaa	Unfortunately there are still those out there who think these values are important and that they should be strictly imparted. It will backfire on them!|`|VuUz8NgKaa	That man is a (insert whatever name here). It doesn't matter to me what race or religion they are.|`|tBx1M0g9aa	No it shouldn't because people fought hard so it wouldn't be this way|`|aAPkpuhqaa	I find it insulting. It shouldn't matter what race/religion someone is. We're all people and should be treated as such.|`|tm0rUy8raa	Of course not. We are all equal.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	It wouldnt bother me as long as their not trying to shove their beliefs down my childs throat.|`|4iXL4C6paa	my children are biracial and they have all different races of friends and I am very happy with that.|`|DNygQdmVaa	No it doesn matter to me what race or religion my childrens friends are.|`|X0ubZnPjaa	no of course not ..thats just silly.|`|ZTRakv6maa	we're all in the human race. other than that...it doesnt much matter to me or my children.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	they sound like a bunch of bigots...don't think i would want my kid to play with theirs.  i sure wouldn't let my kid go to their house..for sure|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	yes, it does to certain groups: jewish, amish, catholic, muslim, ... there are reasons for not marring someone out side your religion and because kids are impressionable you may not want your kids picking up bad habits from other groups. i'm not jewish but i recognize the differences of their up bringing / culture and wouldn't fight it or impose my life style on them. america was founded on being able to live and worship how each of us chooses. i'm not sure when we put everything thing up for a vote and decided a group rule for everyone but that idea goes against the individual freedoms the country was founded on. if you want socialism or Communism where everyone must act alike and prey alike or put in jail go to cuba, russia, the arab countries or china.|`|jxizzHL1aa	man... talk about tolerance.|`|4eTyCuRSaa	I know what race my kids are.  I don't care (as far as race or religion is concerned) who they associate with.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I love it when people tell me to go back to my own country like Im an immigrant
X6as2nOAaa	I just got done going through that my baby is almost 7 months old and I just got her in her crib although she will still wake up a couple of times a night every now and again. I put my small tv with a vcr/dvd player and I play a movie at night I know that might not be the greatest thing to do but it has worked for me so far and then I fill like I can hear the noise on the monitor so I don't wake up over every little thing.
VeuJB4lEaa	hey hun i got my pos OPK on the 7th feb, but we bd'd on the 6th, i think i am the same DPO than you, i did a test on 18th, was a faint faint line, barley noticable, then iv done one friday and today and its a defo pos, faint but pos, so there is still hope though hun good luck, get testing!!! x|`|sxx6u7sXaa	It's possible. Honestly, implantation spotting is really rare, so it may be that AF is just late. You should go ahead and test!|`|ViR6BXiyaa	Maybe you should get a good test, such as a clearblue or first response and test again.  Good Luck xx|`|YaITofFfaa	a|`|I0waERKqaa	maybe. <br>  Feeling sick and bloated is a definite sign.
WPI0Z47saa	I can't take the pill. I get very bad migraines and I had blood clot in my legs from them. My coworker actually got 3 blood clots in her lungs and almost died. But she was also over 35 and your chances of that go up with age.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	The patch is terrible it gives tons of woman blood clots. I was hospitalized because of it!|`|vwoqIUR6aa	yes, I got eye pain and anxiety from birth control. some people can get fat. really depends on the person and birth control you are taking.|`|na2axA4taa	yes i have the living proof of the coil, condom and pill failing. <br>  i had the marina coil fitted but it must have come out as the next thing i knew i was pregnant. the doc never told me you had to go for a 6 week check up to check it was still in place.<br>  condoms split so you should always double them up.<br>  and i missed one pill and got pregnant<br>  i know it  sounds crazy (extreme bad luck) but its true so birth control has not worked for me. <br>  but i am going to have the implant next and knowing my track record and luck i will have the only dodgy one in the box<br>  hope my answer helped and have a nice day x|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	Well right now im on a new birth control, because the one i used to take [yazmin] wasn't strong enough and i would bleed so much.<br>  and i've been taking this new one for over a week, and i've been having terrible cramps and back pain and bleeding EVERYDAY.<br>  <br>  it's still going on....ughh..|`|YaITofFfaa	a|`|yp9rEMSraa	Yes! I was always bloated and my periods were really heavy, bad cramps and backaches(was told that by being on BC that my cramping and backaches would go away,,,wrong!!)...i only stayed on it for maybe a year and got off..i also gained 30 pounds on it....i was just taking the pills...did not like the way it made me feel either  cant explain it but just did not feel right on it|`|9HPAzlYBaa	OH GOD YES..I HAD THEE WORST CRAMPS IN THE WORLD..IT WAS WORSE THEN THE CRAMPS THAT I HAD BEFORE I STARTED BIRTH CONTROL..IT FELT LIKE SOMEONE WAS SQEEZING THE LIFE OUT OF MY UTERUS..NEED TO STAY I STOPPED USING IT..|`|zOU5fNHWaa	I dated a girl with Asama, she always said the pill made her breathing difficult.

VGij9p0Taa	Congrats on your little girl! <br>  Paige - meaning page is adorable very common yet sweet and effective teamed with either a family name or a traditional name like Catherine it will be adorable. <br>  Summer - of course meaning and associated with that lovely season. I would only use the name if it the child is born in this season otherwise I think it is slightly naff. <br>  Lilly - meaning a lily which is a symbol of purity, which is very pure and cute. Lilly is very sweet and traditional my favourite name. Prefer the spelling Lily however I have you thought of Lillian. <br>  Hope this helps and good luck with everything.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Lovely names.<br>  <br>  For first and middle<br>  <br>  Paige Lorene<br>  Summner Leigh<br>  Lilly Jane|`|llgBLR6daa	beautiful. congrats!|`|cErLq7f3aa	i love Paige. i don't really like any of the others...|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	i really like paige and lily|`|mvKbfkhGaa	Lilly is the cutest! I know too many gothic people named paige so i think that's why i really hate the name...and I like Summer but my name is Autumn and i always get someone saying something about people calling me fall or winter and it get's annoying so i wouldn't name my baby a season. Congrats on having a baby girl though! They are so wonderful!|`|8OoqHpbIaa	Lilly Summer<br>  <br>  <br>  Lovely name<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your little Girl <br>  xxxxxxxx|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I like Lilly the best.

Congratulations, by the way!|`|AA12021966	I like Paige and Lilly best (not together though).<br>  <br>  Not too keen on Summer.|`|ksoMldqYaa	I like them--Summer is my favorite and what I will be naming my child if it's a girl (once I get pregnant!)|`|e4M4uQXNaa	Lilly is my favorite!  I like it better as just Lily though, or if it's kept Lilly, then short for Liliane, Lilian, Liliana, Lillian, Lilith, Lilia, etc lol.  It's gorgeous and classic.<br>  <br>  Summer is really cute and fun too, and reminds me more of a beach type of girl.  <br>  <br>  Paige is nice as well, and gives me the picture of a sweet, hard-working girl. <br>  <br>  Lily is still my favorite lol.  It's the kind of name that will last her through her whole life and still sound great.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the girl!|`|LmaGaIosaa	I think they are all beautiful what do you think of Topaz|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I like all three of your name choices. My name is Summer and I've always liked my name. I was always the only Summer around and it was a fun name. I never got teased (in a mean way). I saw some opinions on my name saying it was trashy, but I totally disagree with that! But yeah, I like all your names! Good Luck.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	they are all okay.I work w/ the public.SO,please don't do something like choose Summer Dawn.Kids can't live those names down-ever.I knew a girl named Rebekah Paige as a girl.They just called her Paige.I just loved that name!|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	I LOVE the name Lilly, but i would use just one L, still.. its not me and its a beautiful name so if you like it then go for it.<br>  <br>  I like Paige, and i see Summer as middle name, sorry :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|cXdoFRVsaa	Summer.

nggeyCseaa	Not together hun,<br>  also, robyn should be a middle name in my opinion<br>  naomi is a nice name, <br>  gd luck|`|ua38QDIfaa	I really like the name Naomi but, I don't really care for Robyn. What about Naomi Dea or something.|`|l7U9dGrWaa	robyn nice but dosen t go with naomi sorry|`|X8Q1zXaMaa	I like Robyn, but I dont think that Naomi sounds that great with it.|`|4ew4ogH8aa	I don't like the name Robyn.

Naomi is alright I suppose, but Robyn I don't like at all.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Horrible.<br>  Sorry do not like it at all!|`|bS6RPi9saa	both are nice names they just don't go together sorry|`|n9p5cycsaa	Depends on where you're from. Around here in Northern America it's a little odd. Robin is more normal. Though if it's pronounced the same it doesn't make much difference. And Naomi is a bit different. But they do sound ok with each other.|`|W0kEGRhraa	i really like both names together. <br>  very cute. <br>  i loved the way you spelt Robyn. I have seen it spelt like Robin and I really like how you spelt it.|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I hate the name Robyn. I love the name Naomi. I don't like the way they sound together at all.|`|y1BNwoJyaa	I like Naomi but not Robyn.  And those 2 names really don't go together anyway.|`|dDDCoIjkaa	I don't really like the name Robyn. Naomi doesn't go with the first name. So sorry!|`|ZYONnSk9aa	ummm no. I would go with somthing that does not take 2 first names and puts them together. Try Robyn linn, or Naomi rose|`|n6IBfiDPaa	hmmm <br>  I really like both of those names, but maybe not so much together|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Maybe Naomi Robyn?<br>  I've never been a fan of Robin or Robyn.
U5xo9wIfaa	Since it is cold you can try something really different.  Buy a couple boxes of hot chocolate and marshmallows and go door to door selling a packet for about 25 cents each.. give 5 or so marshmallows with each packet. Its kind of a stupid idea but its all i can think of :)! She can also try walking dogs because its cold and not many people want to go out and do that.... Well good luck!|`|72c3b924e93e85f5493bc3f07051afb4aa	The first thing I'd do, because of the weather is go through some of the things she no longer uses and try and sell them off of Ebay or if you have a heated garage - garage sale.<br>  <br>  She could always check around the neighborhood to see if she could help out with cleaning chores or if you're willing to give an allowance for things that she does around the house too.<br>  <br>  Also, people are always looking for help with elderly people, even if it's simply reading a book to them or just keeping them company.  Check around town for possibilities like that.  Best of luck!|`|AA11935865	First of all she can't earn 200$ in one day, but here are a few tips to gain money:<br>  - Baby sitting<br>  - Mowing the lawn<br>  - Sell lemonade<br>  - Ebay<br>  - Chores in the house<br>  - Walk dogs<br>  - Ask neighbors if they need help with anything<br>   There are lots of other stuff but she should start with these basics... she'll get the money she wants in no time|`|LAsYy7C8aa	i think if there is a gfs in your area they have boxes of candy bars for fundraising.  Maybe she can do some chores for the neighbors or something.  Or wait till warmer weather and wash cars...its not that far off.  My 10 year old will be walking dogs this summer.|`|0kIwehVbaa	Chores say maybe she gets a dollar a chore or something:)|`|uTGK7bMBaa	hmm thats a touch one...i was gonna say sell chocolate boxes (old way) :)|`|d7kGopYxaa	sell chili.LOL|`|tDKQ8lwsaa	make money online, it's the easiest way. i'm 12 and i made $130 in 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  tip: blogger.com and google adsense|`|ZPoOSUnNaa	Maybe you can help her out by selling stuff online such as on craigslist or on ebay. Ask her what she doesn't want anymore. You won't have to go outside for this.|`|TuLZwRObaa	she could shovel light snow on drive ways and walk ways.cut her some some slack and give her money for little things, washing dishes DUSTING thats a good one.|`|C2F0CxpSaa	Long term, I suggest that you encourage her to save all her Christmas/Birthday money in a bank account<br>  Worked for me|`|rBn4NP5Caa	Sell some stuff on ebay|`|AA11486869	have her make cookies and sell them at a local grocery store or something like that|`|QIDhVAjjaa	she can shovel walks for neighbors|`|QfYGhtVwaa	Do jobs for family and friends, cleaning, tidying etc. So she is safe, inside and knows the people. It will take time.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	do house chores...sweeping, washing dishes, vacuuming, dusting,ect|`|om4uztzxaa	you can give her the money if u care so much<br>  <br>  bake some cookies<br>  <br>  look in the couches<br>  <br>  ask her aunt, dad, gradma<br>  <br>  sell some stuff<br>  <br>  volunteer|`|LSxBwiFSaa	She can "sit" for somebodys Pet. Do little chores around peoples houses (walk the dog; take out the garbage; play with the Baby, etc.), shovel off sidewalks, -lots of stuff !  Hope She makes it!  :)|`|EZyHOht7aa	Sell chocolate bars SISTA.|`|283JrACKaa	make her do some chores around the house
dnG7fhnbaa	Yeah, there was one girl on here who'd answered several questions and claimed to be a midwife in the "what's your source" box...but her answers made no sense so I checked out her profile...and sure enough, there she was asking for tips on what to do for her 13th birthday party! lol.|`|z93tSvKxaa	They are learning how to be trash from all the older single baby mothers out there.  The biggest question should be WHERE THE HELL ARE THEIR PARENTS?<br>  <br>  **By the way this country will continue it's degenerate path as long as this continues.  Why is it today that it is okay for unwed teens to get pregnant and have babies?  It is a DISGRACE and NOTHING to be proud of.  The best thing the govt. can do is STOP GIVING THEM WELFARE!<br>  Make their baby daddies and parents pay for their illegitimate children or else sterilize them.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yes i have seen a lot of that, i mean its one thing if they are pregnant (not that its good) but they have no experience on the topic what-so-ever. But you know that a 13 year old knows so much more about pregnancy then a 24 year old pregnant woman <sarcasm>|`|i8Ch743Laa	I've not noticed,some actually,from knowing what others have went through,give sound advice though.|`|glDiHaDeaa	Yes there are extremely too many teens on this site that are pregnant or have curiosity about it or who are answering questions. <br>  <br>  Not that theres anything wrong with them answering or even having babies. I mean, people get on these girls cases about 1.) being pregnant and then 2.) getting an abortion. I think it's sad to see so many young mothers but at the same time, they are being attacked from both sides. <br>  <br>  The ones that bother me are the ones who are obviously too young minded to even be having sex, such as the "what if" questions<br>  <br>  ex...<br>   "Can i get pregnant if im on my period." -thats asked at least `100 times a day.<br>  "AM i pregnant...please answer"- Seriously, they should have a section strictly on am i, could i, will i be pregnant.<br>  <br>  "If i get pre-*** on my underwear can i be pregnant."- just WOW<br>  <br>  "If im off my BC pill for 2 hours, can i be pregnant"- Seriously...<br>  <br>  Anyway, you guys see what im saying. Some of these girls are on the right track... and some are just lost...<br>  <br>  Sorry so long haha.|`|ckgiPMm4aa	Well I happen to be seventeen years old. I got pregnant with my daughter when I was only fifteen and kept her. Me and her father have been married for over a year now, and live in Germany (where he is stationed as a soldier in the United States Army) and am currently pregnant with our second child.<br>  <br>  I know more about being pregnant then a lot of the other wives in my husbands unit, and/or on here. It really doesn't matter the age if you know what your talking about.|`|SihmWU0Baa	well some of us have gone thru some things that some people have<br>  <br>  im 16 me and my boyfriend  talked bout having kids a ways down the road and i had a misscarriadge in may of 08 and i started new birth control the nuva ring...<br>  <br>  we were using condoms and in august 08 we found out i was pregnant agian  we first though adoption because we dissagree with abortion<br>  <br>  but we foud out it was a boy in january and our minds got changed when we found tht out we have the support of our parents for being adults and doing what was the best for the baby<br>  <br>  but then we started thinking since im out of school and we both have good jobs and he works first shift and i work second he gets off as im going on <br>  <br>  and then we started thinking how cool it would be to have the sound of little feet around and we named him then we couldnt stop thinkin bout him everywhere we went we seen baby clothes and we made the decision to keep him<br>  <br>  and we have full support from our familes <br>  <br>  so i know what alot of people are going thru and i help as much as i can and help people that may be going thru the same things as we did <br>  <br>  so i think it is great that peple that are younger then the average pregnancy rate would get the help and get answers to thier questions|`|fHgbL046aa	There are a lot of teens on here that are pregnant and don't know what to do. The one I read was a teen who was pregnant and had other teens telling her right on. Some of the teens could be TROLLS and making the whole thing up. You just never know. When you hear about a teen who is raped and being beaten by her boyfriend or a father. Its really out there. I'm not saying it doesn't happen,but what kind of advice are you asking for when coming to Yahoo. The girl KATE it sounds like your keeping your baby because you found out it was a boy. What would have happened if you were carrying a girl?|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	I'm not a "pre-teen", i'm 20, and I've never been pregnant. i answer in this category all the time, especially the "could I be pregnant" questions. I haven't been through it, but I do a lot of random research on things that interest me, and this is one of them since it could be me some day.<br>  And i seem to get a lot of best answers. Actually, i think I was a top contributor in this category last month. I guess it's because I give the text book answers, but always honest, and thorough. If some kid comes on freaking out that they're 14 and pregnant, I don't give them a lecture because they know they made a mistake, I tell them the actual information they are looking for, like to go to the doctor and blah blah blah like that. They're not looking for every answer to be "omg where are your parents". That doesn't help them. They want ACTUAL advice and they don't know where else to go. <br>  So I help them. Maybe thats why i get so many  BAs because no one else will give them honest answers. Everyone else just wants to tell them how stupid they were. <br>  I guess a thorough, truthful, helpful textbook answer from someone inexperienced is better than an unhelpful, hard to read answer from someone who IS experienced.<br>  <br>  And I'm not saying it happens every time, but sometimes even mothers are totally wrong.. Example I see all the time.. "OMG I pumped my breast milk and it's GREEN?!"...  you scan down and most the answers, even from moms are saying OMG DONT USE IT, THROW IT OUT!! NOT SAFE, INFECTION, DOCTOR! They don't know that it's completely normal and due to the nutrients in the body, something that many women wouldn't know because they don't pump so they never see their own milk. But yet they're giving other moms uninformed advice. <br>  <br>  I think ANYONE should answer ANY question they know about, and just avoid the ones they don't know rather than give bad advice.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	maybe they have lived pregnancies from they're sisters.mothers or friends.If someone can give decent advice why would we bother about their age?I'm sure that there are a lot of teens out there that know more than older women.It's not age that matters but experience.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I never noticed. But most kids think they know everything|`|VHHis05Naa	I have, and it's super scary to know kids so young are so engrossed with the idea of pregnancy and babies.  :(  Makes me worry more about my now 3 yo little girl.|`|AA11210211	lol I have wondered the same thing,I don't know???
1S7uXsInaa	For the fever, I use this gel thing (I think that it is called Kool something, sorry I can not remember the name) that you can put on their head for up to 8 hours.  It works like a champ, I use it on my 10 month old and my 5 year old.  As for the blisters, and oatmeal bath may give some relief, you can plop yourself in the tub with him.  Does he seem uncomfortable or do you assume with the way he looks that he must be uncomfortable?  I have found that with my kids, I often assume when they are sick/hurt that they are feeling much worse than they really are.|`|AA11808995	Your Doctor has a duty toward the child and he must see him.You are not qualified to make a decision on the childs health.Regarding ointments and lotions much better is got on prescription.Meanwhile put some kind of gloves on him and that will prevent the situation worsening by scratching.Stop floundering and take him to the Doctors Surgery tomorrow insist he looks at the child.Should that fail then of course you must take him to A&E at your local hospital pronto and I mean quick.The poor kid will be in such distress.|`|irP2yTMWaa	Well my boy got them off my daughter at 2 week old and had calpol and a cool bath can they have a anti inflammatory go  to a pharmacy and check that reduce the itching|`|qusZuvqoaa	oatmeal bath supposed to help. Thats what my mom did to my brother but he was also older.|`|16641bd7e1d219d87426f344e7659b26aa	Putting sodium bicarbonate in the bath helps take the itch out of chicken pox. Also, ibuprofen (infant neurofen) is an anti-inflammatory as well as lowerng the temperature and relieving pain- this will help with the spots too, maybe slightly better than calpol. Finally you can give an anti-histamine such as piriton (just check you can give it to under 1's- not sure without looking it up) that also takes the anger out of the spots. The thing about chicken pox it's internal as well as external hence they will have spots in the mouth and throat- right the way through!!!<br>  <br>  Lots of cuddles of course. Poor all of you- it's tough!|`|yB5go5wbaa	Poor little guy!  Try an oatmeal bath or mixing baking soda with water until it makes a paste - apply that to the pox and it'll help dry them up.<br>  <br>  EDIT: There's really nothing the doctor can do.  You could take him in, but I wouldn't waste a trip down there when you know it's chicken pox and your doctor told you over the phone he can't do anything.  It should get better in a few days!|`|FmhUZLgoaa	I would definitely take him to the hospital. ASAP Good Luck

RKbxxjJuaa	Other than bringing home something the baby has worn, and having her around other babies from time to time, there isn't much else you can do.  Sounds to me that you're doing/have done a good job!  Other than that, have faith in your "first baby".  I had a miniature pinscher when my daughter was born, and she was VERY attached to me....the vet even diagnosed her with severe separation anxiety and prescribed her doggie prozac, for times that I had to leave the house....I was really worried, however, my daughter's grandfather brought home a little t shirt for my dog to check out, BEFORE baby and I came home and hoped for the best....our first day home, my daughter's grandfather was holding her and she began to cry....and my dog (who was very fond of "pop-pop") barked at him, as if to say, "what are you doing to my baby" until my daughter was comforted...there was not a single sign of aggression, and my daughter, now 7, called my mini pin her "sister dog" until she became sick and we had to put her down....everyone will mesh together given time!|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	My dog was 9 years old and HATED all babies and children when I had my baby.  I had people bring things home from the hospital that had his scent on them.  When we got home from the hospital, I came in first without the baby and gave her a lot of attention.  My husband brought baby in and sat his carseat down on the floor so our dog could give him the sniff down...we also put a dog treat on our baby's lap.  We just made sure to always give our dog her share of attention and we haven't had any issues.  The dog still isn't crazy about baby (he's 16 months), but she tolerates him and has been a million times better than we anticipated.|`|AA12315431	I am in the same boat. I am 8 weeks pregnant and have an almost 2 year old 85 pound American Bulldog. When we babysit our nephew she gets so jealous but she is also really good with him. I am not sure if there is a way to make a dog not jealous at all. The dog has been your one and only baby until now so it is going to be an adjustment. Just don't forget all about her. You will be caught up with your baby for sure but don't forget to give your dog some attention and time as well. When my brother and sister-in-law started having kids, their poor cat didn't get any attention at all. Now it is starving for it. When other people come over it constantly rubs up against their legs and meows just to get any attention or petting at all. Poor thing.|`|iM2BaJbeaa	My sister went and bought a baby doll that cried and one of those play car seats and put in on the floor made it cry and what ever else she even had a baby blanket with stuff like pacifers and bottles with real mil in it so the dogs would get use to this stuff being around the floor area. Also you can buy a baby cd with baby noises and play it so the dog can get use to the sounds of a newborn baby i hope this helps :)|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I downloaded baby noises and played them loudly every now and then so our dog would get use to crying/cooing/ect. We also exposed him to children as often as possible, with our friend's permission of course! We brought home her blanket from the hospital so he could sniff it before we brought her home. But really, I just made sure he knew right from the start that SHE was in charge. He wasn't allowed to approach her unless we said it was OK, he definitely respects her and doesn't get in her space. They love each other though, it's absolutely adorable.|`|ZKm894kfaa	I don't think there is any way to completely avoid the jealously issue, but with time your dog will get over it and love the baby like they have always been there.  Our dog got so protective that he wouldn't let my bf parents near our son. We had to put the dog outside.  The blanket idea is a great one, I would try that.  Also remember that you need to always keep an eye on your dog when it is around your baby.|`|vigFmfLmaa	First, there's no reason to assume that you have to give your pet away.  She's a family member too.  With a little acclimation to your newborn she will most likely learn to get along.  Some people begin confining the pet to certain areas where the baby will be most.  That way she can adjust to and learn your baby's scents and sounds when they come home.  A blanket from the hospital is good, but has lots of other non-baby smells on it as well.  If you have a stained beyond help onesie or blanket at home throw it in the dog's bed so she's constantly around the baby's smell.  Gradually and only with supervision begin to introduce them to one another.  Hopefully they will mesh well.  Most times dogs do well with infants and newborns, it's the mobile and interactive toddlers that are more of a worry.  I think it's very responsible for you to be concerned with this so early on.|`|2uOhDMKjaa	When my mom was pregnant with me, she let the dog into my room and smell my baby clothes before i was born. Spend time with it in the babies room while you are pregnant, and let her smell the new clothes. My dog went straight to the protective stage once i was born because she was so prepared for me.|`|rRUMA2YVaa	I know this sounds weird, but the day before I came home from the hospital with my first son, my husband brought home the hat that my son had wore while in the hospital and let the dog have it to get familiar with the smell of it.  When we brought my son home, my dog knew the smell and knew it was okay for him to be there.  It sounded weird to me at first, but it worked really well.  Good luck and congrats!|`|2n0B4cY6aa	well she should be fine. Blanket idea is good, maybe buy one of those annoying dolls that crys etc to get her used to it<br>  not sure really.<br>  I would ask this question in dog section, your get better answers

AA11283706	It's not really a good idea to order Clomid off the internet. It stimulates your ovaries to produce eggs, and regulate your cycle. Now, if you already have healthy cycles you will in all liklihood produce multiple eggs, which could result in 2, 3, 4 or even 5 babies. You also run the risk of hyperstimulation that will affect your ability to breathe and cysts in your ovaries. I really wouldn't take hormones without the supervision of your Doctor. It carries too many risks.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	Are you talking about Clomid?  If they spell it clymoid then you should stay away.  In fact, don't take anything like that without a doctors prescription. This pill is for people who have trouble conceiving not for someone who wants multiples.  Clomid doesn't work like that anyway. Seriously, don't take this pill...You have no idea what damage you may be causing yourself.|`|BMVNuhXiaa	i advise u not to take any thing if the doctor does not give it to u because u might not even need it so go see your doctor he knows whats best for u u might harm yourself then to have a baby so dont order them a doctor need to order them for u if they think u need it|`|5Ppmmy4qaa	what is the reason behind twins?? <br>  best thing to do is go to this website and ask this dr what he/she thinks. if i was u i wouldn't do anything until i talked to a dr. this isn't a pill to just get pregnant its to ovulate. and if your already ovulating then u might stop u or do something that it shouldn't. gl and baby dust<br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=53693" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/a...</a>

No signs AF is coming is good but can also be not so good, cause remember that a lot of PG symptoms are related to symptoms we get when expecting our AF... which sucks!

IGYa2yF6aa	I have a friend who is a nanny. She also took the safety course and got certified as a babysitter. Anyway, she swears she can get babysitting gigs any night (or day) of the week just by going on Craigslist. She rarely has to list her services. She just answers the ads and gets same-day jobs. Have your parents help you check them out so you don't get into any unsafe situations. Another good way to get jobs with people you can trust is to get referrals. Ask your parents to tell their friends and coworkers that you're available. You'll be surprised how fast the word spreads. Good babysitters are always in demand!|`|rMgnmMN9aa	I put up an ad on Craigslist.com under childcare for my area with all my info and got a ton of responses! also kijiji.com but it's no where near as good as craigslist.com sometimes people are looking for part time babysitters and post in the same categlory!

AA11987492	I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the enis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis....<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Your son can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I wouldn't do that to a baby, however from other local moms(Ontario, Canada)  I hear its very hard to find a doctor that will do a circumcision.<br>  <br>  That really doesn't upset me in the slightest.

Most of the ones who do don't seem to have done any real research.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|6b151cbf6d75d6f7c539a19dfdf3b436aa	Yes, I did have my son circumcized. I was told there are no actual health benefits to it but most people have it done based on religious beliefs, concerns about hygiene, or for social reasons I knew it was unnecessary but I didn't want my son to feel "different" amongst his peers|`|o5piRiBsaa	I had my son circumcised.  After our gender scan showed he was a boy, I was asked if we wanted him circumcised; we had already decided, so they didn't discuss it with us beyond that.  But I did my own research.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	You asked this yesterday and I'll tell you the same thing:<br>  <br>  Stop pushing your biased agenda on others and accept that not everyone believes as you do about circumcision.  And the side effects you list are so rare.  There are complications with any surgical procedure.  So if you have to have your appendix removed, will you refuse the surgery because of the risk of something going wrong?<br>  <br>  Get over it.  Move on.  My son and husband are both circumcised and have no problems (physically or mentally) with it.  I have nothing against parents who don't circumcise their sons either.  It's a personal matter that is up to the parents.  We did what we felt was in the best interest of our son.<br>  <br>  We got unbiased information on both the risks and benefits of circumcision.  My husband made the decision to have our son circumcised.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	No I don't believe that I was given a run down of complications or benefits but then again it was all kinda hazy after the birth! :) they asked if we wanted it done and we just said yes... and we do plan to have our second son done as well...|`|K4zsztkRaa	I would never mutliate my kids.<br>  <br>  If I did then I would think I needed to be put away for it.<br>  <br>  People say all the side effects are rare but the more and more people do it, the more likley those "rare" occurences are likley to happen.<br>  <br>  I mean people say it's like one in a million, well what if you son just happens to be the million?<br>  I mean the more and more boys that are circumcised the closer and closer people get to that one out of a million.<br>  <br>  It's like a ticking time bomb.<br>  <br>  oh also it's a proven fact that 10% of circumcisons have some sort of long term side effect. Most like 90% of those 10% go unnoticed or people don't realize their is a problem, they think it's "normal" when really it can cause a very serious issue.<br>  <br>  People need to wake up and realize they are doing horrible things to their kids.<br>  It needs to stop.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|7kosr9mcaa	I am from London, Ontario, Canada. When I had my son the hospital didn't even ask us any questions about circumcision. I never once got asked if I wanted him done. I did NOT have him circumcised. I would never do that to an infant. Also, here not many doctors will do it. My friend had to take her son to a private clinic to get it done. It also costs $375.00!!! In no way was i going to fork out that money only to put my son through immense pain.|`|AA11210211	Yes my son is circumcised,his ped. told me all the facts about it,good and bad,I don't remember exactly what all he said I have slept since then and that was 3 1/2 yrs ago but I had decided before I had children that if I have a son he will be circumcised.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i had my son done and i regret it- the doc gave me good info but i was young and dumb. i won't do it to an future sons if we should have any.

wZAeBisbaa	Well, I certainly know a lot of guys who would agree that the woman  gets her way in relationships!  <br>  <br>  But yes, I think birth order affects personality development.  Later borns essentially experience a different family than their first born siblings.  Who is around the household, how much attention they get, and whose needs take priority are always different from the first to the last.  And parents learn from experience, so later borns are even getting somewhat different parents than the older ones had.  <br>  <br>  But think about this. If a trait is affected by birth order, that means it is not inborn or genetic. It can be changed.  Sharing and giving to others are learned behaviors.  If you want to be better at them, it's possible to get that way by practicing and by imitating people who do them well.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	They did an actual study on this actually and found that many first, middle and last born shared same personality traits. <br>  I think all my kids fit into a stereotypical birth order personality for their place in our family. <br>  I was an only kid and although I dont think I was that spoiled, in the other areas I'm pretty stereotypical only kid I guess.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Yes!! I'm a oldest/middle..... Between the two in responsibility, but more to the older/more responsible side. I ususally take the least/try to make others happy first (middle).<br>  <br>  I do well with other olders/middles. Babies seem too carefree for me lol.|`|WgyGipBMaa	Hmm makes since I never really thought about it till now.. But i'm not a very good sharer sometimes and I am very used to getting my way lol and im the youngest  but my husbands the oppisite and hes the oldest|`|zb8VWAcXaa	I agree!  I have actually read about it too.  Often, the oldest child is a peacemaker, and likes rule and order.  The youngest is often creative and more scatterbrained.  My husband and I are both the youngest (yikes!) - me of 6 children, him of 2.  Often we can both be HUGE babies about things, especially regarding our families.  It's funny, because we just encourage each other sometimes, and have a hard time seeing that we're being silly or selfish because we both feel the same.  But we work it out and try to overcome these things together.  We have a great marriage and we work really well together.  <br>  <br>  (P.S. - Being a girl doesn't give you an excuse to be a baby either!)|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Yes I think it affects personality to an extent.  I have 4 siblings and I was one of the middle children.  I take care of people, share great, quiet, shy.  It was just the 3 oldest for 8 years, so I concider my family to have two babies.  There's my brother, me, and my younger sister who was definately spoiled by all involved.  ;-)  Then came my younger brother and another younger sister, who is also spoiled by all.  It was very interesting seeing the two younger sisters grow up and fight for attention.|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	I think it does. I've noticed this with many families. I think it all boils down to the way the parents treat the children. Of course all parents want to treat each of their children equally, but the experience of the parent differs with each child. The way that a parent "parents" their first child will differ with the way they parent their last. Most of the time they're a lot more cautious, methodical, and naive about their firstborn. By the time they're on their last child, they might employ a more relaxed parenting strategy. Perhaps they took their firstborn to the ER every time he looked or sounded funny. Then with their last child, they didn't make a single trip because they realized most things were not a big deal. I believe the parenting style of each child based on the parents' experience has a huge effect on their personalities.
sAbah6dTaa	my daughter loves my facial lotion and i was at work and my husband keeps her home on fridays. well he works thursday night on 3rd shift and must of been really tired, he fell asleep and woke up to a winter wonderland she had wiped lotion all over every window and mirror she could reach!! needless to say it smelled really good when i came home for lunch =)|`|PFO1jxZGaa	well they havent ried to drive yet but they have smeared poop on them selves etc. <br>  My daughter has a thing for vaseline ( shes 18 mos) and I use it after bath on her because her skin is really dry. She can open the bathroom door now and keeps going in and grabbing the vaseline and she opens it and statrs lathering it all over herself. So unless I catch her early she'll be covered with it in a minute. <br>  But I guess nothing too crazy..
8t8NjjnVaa	If I ever saw a baby alone in a car and it was apparent that it was hot in the car, I would break a window, get the baby out, and then call the police.

I, personally have a glass break on my key-chain and a seat-belt cutter (all in one) so I wouldn't even need to break a sweat to get that little one out.  Then I would set off the alarm on it so they could find me as quickly as possible in the parking lot.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Betty C.  I agree.  That is why I would call 911 and ask them what I should do.  I think that if it was a very hot day and a child was strapped in and locked up, the authorities would tell you to break the window.  And, yes it is very sad about the state of the world.  but, don't Good Samaritan laws protect someone just trying to help the child??|`|J9Tbun7naa	If it was that hot I'd break a window and call the police. If the baby looked ok, not sweating and it was a colder day I'd take maybe 2 minutes to have a look around to see if I could find the parents.... it's be safer to have the door opened with a key than shattering glass everywhere...BUT I'd still report the parents. Leaving a baby in a car is NOT ok regardless of the temperature.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I would call the police and wait there for them to arrive. Im 5 foot 1 and barely weight 100lbs not pregnant so I wouldn't be tough enough to even know how to break the window.<br>  <br>  I think a passing tough looking person I would stop if the police are taking to long.

I wouldn't break the window of the car myself because I would be afraid of not doing it right and injuring myself, the child, or both.|`|7IHMjy2caa	As someone else said.

While I was out with my children one day we walked through a parking lot where we saw a young child (maybe 3, not an infant) in a car by himself screaming his head off. There were two stores near by. I went in one searching for the parent and alerted the employees there, but no parent was available. The second store I repeated this and came upon the parent chit chatting w/someone as if she had all the time in the world. She went to her child reluctantly then chastised me for bothering her. She stated, "My child was not screaming and was just fine. You pulled me away from my conversation for nothing." Then she drove off. I was livid and felt helpless at the same time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: The only problem w/just taking the child from the car and then alerting the authorities or contacting the parent, as good-willed as your intentions may be you can actually be charged w/child abduction. Even in an extreme case, if everything turns out fine for the child or not, the parent(s) in return could file charges on you. For those who have nothing to lose (no kids) it's all fine and dandy, but something like child abduction on your record no matter the reason, does not look good and you may very well jeopardize keeping your children.<br>  <br>  This is a sad, sad world we live in when being a good Samaritan can have charges brought against them for doing what is right. (It does happen too)|`|VGueFw4gaa	In CPR class they teach to call 911 or assign someone to call 911 before starting CPR.  The same situation applies.  Call 911, then break a window far away from the baby.  I would try to attract as much attention as possible to what I was doing so no one would think I'm going to try to kidnap the child.  And hopefully get somebody's attention who has medical training.  Minutes count in this situation and saving life is more important than property damage.|`|7d3adc8b8ddb50801b26f5c95af67ee8aa	Screw finding the parent...I'd break that window!

I know how tiring it is to be a parent.|`|ec9b0745349f4057fabba5ee0e67e965aa	considering there is no way of knowing how long that childs been in there, id break the windsheild, get the baby.........then send the police after the parent who left that child in there.
aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Yes.  It's an 'open' adoption I don't see the problem<br>  <br>  I would've been over the moon to have my Mom contact me this way, how wonderful|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I have 2 adopted children.  When our oldest turned 18 we heard from the attorney that was used in our adoption that our son's sister was looking for him. We had to chose to tell our son or not, we did, and he has a pretty good relationship through email, myspace and telephone, and an occasion visit to their home town.  It was very positive.  If you truly want to meet your birth son, do all you can to find him.  You know when he actually is 18 so then he would be legal to make up his own mind.  Good luck.|`|JPBh5WT3aa	Yes.   I would contact him.  He has a right to know you.  Do not come on too strong, just let him know that you are interested in opening that door.  Whatever you do, let him take the lead and let him do things in his own time.  He did not have any choice in adoption, so let him make the choices now.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	Speaking as an adopted child I can speak on this pretty well.<br>  <br>  I do believe you should contact them but you should not do it directly.  If I were you I would get an intermediary to make first contact or alternatively a letter - not an email addressed to him to ask if he is even open to knowing you. <br>  <br>  When I was 17 that answer would have been NO!.  Now that I am older I am curious as to who they really were other than the bit of info I have.  If my birth mom had contacted me I would not have seen her but I would have kept her name and contact info.<br>  <br>  Your child may be different than me but if you just show up out of left field you give him no room to react and get used to the idea.<br>  <br>  It would have felt like an ambush to me.<br>  <br>  So yes contact him just don't do it directly.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Since you gave birth to him, you should know if he is 17 or 18. If he is 18 he is an adult in the eyes of the law. If your adoption is open, go for it. Don't wait around for anymore "what ifs".|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Harsh as this may sound, he has a Mum and Dad. He may not want to have contact with you. Yes you 'gave' birth but they raised him. He is not your son, he is their son.|`|GBKaftrJaa	It's considered very poor form in contact ettiquette to contact the parents instead of the adoptee.  Even if the adoptee were 12, it would be better to call and ask to speak directly to him/her and then tell him/her to let the parents know who is on the phone.<br>  <br>  Many adoptees are so angered when their parents go through the adoptive parents to talk to them that they cut off all contact permanently.  The reason being is, they feel they had no say in their adoption, and here they are able to speak for themselves and they are still being negotiated like a contract. One other mom I know who made that mistake got lots of contact from the parents but her son would never speak to her. They even invited the mom I know to their house and the fully grown adoptee locked himself in his room until she was gone, all becuse she contacted his parents instead of him.  That never ended.  It was a completely failed reunion.<br>  <br>  I contacted my son by phone being careful to follow all the rules of contact ettiquette, making him write down my phone number before telling him who he was speaking to, and breaking it to him very gently and slowly. And I told him to tell his mom, that this was not a secret and that went very well. She was a little miffed that I hadn't ASKER HER if I could talk to him and I explained it all and pointed out that she was an adult and could handle hurt feelings where as we couldn't expect that from him.<br>  <br>  It's also bad form to make contact by letter because letters can go astray and you can't see how the reaction is going on the other side.  Phone contact is considered best.  You can easily give them the option of hanging up and put the ball in their hands at that point.<br>  <br>  So now that the letter option has backfired, you need to call on a non school day and ask to speak to him.  First have him write down your number in case he hangs up out of shock. And if he says he doesn't want contact, that's it. You don't make contact again.  You've put the ball in his court.<br>  <br>  And do not show up at their door. That's the worst contact method.  It scares them.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	I'm an AP in an open adoption.  Just yesterday my daughter forwarded me an e-mail joke and I noticed she copied her natural mother on it.  I sort of twisted my head and thought, "Wow, she's communicating with K directly."  I had to stop and think for a moment to figure out how I felt about it.  It's hard to let them grow up.<br>  <br>  My daughter is 10 and I'm the one who put her natural mother in her parental controlled e-mail address book.  I'm the one usually nudging everyone to stay in contact and here she did it all by herself without me.  After I recognized I was having control freak thoughts I relaxed and realized she has every right to communicate with her other mother without my approval.<br>  <br>  So if I were in your shoes, I would send him an e-mail to the 18 year old MySpace page.  I don't see anything wrong with it.  Since you have an open adoption, it seems well within your rights.  Who knows, maybe he put the account there hoping you would find him?  <br>  <br>  PS  His parents may be ignoring the letter or maybe they never received it.  It's a possibility.|`|jHZqOuVEaa	I suggest that you contact Claudia Corrigan D'Arcy at her blogspot (link below).  She was in a similar situation with her son.  She did contact him and they are in reunion.  He was a few months away from his 18th b-day and his adoptive parents had a $hit fit about the contact.  They got pretty ugly about it so be careful there.<br>  <br>  Even though it is supposed to be an open adoption they might get nasty with you and try to poison your son against you.  Understand that it sounds like you did not hold up your end of the openness so they are probably going to resent your interest now and see it as an intrusion.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://musingsofthelame.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://musingsofthelame.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  Does your son know that this was supposed to be an open adoption?<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|jrCZ6fadaa	WOW, seems he made the page for you... give it a go. <br>  <br>  ETA-ignore the person below me...... you ARE his mom as well as the person who raised him, one does not cancel out the other!! If he made that page after you send the letter he is probably hoping you will contact him.....just send a simiple note letting him know you are there for him when he is ready.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	If it was me, I would contact him. I would keep it low key without any pressure but just letting him know I am available to talk if and when he is ready. I wouldn't be too gushy, but see nothing wrong with letting him know I have always loved him and want what's best for him.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Maybe he got the letter but is to scared to meet you face-to-face or write you a letter.  I'd say send him an email or comment on his myspace account and see if he responds.  If so, good.  If not, well...he was adopted so he might not want contact.|`|1lE3FLqOaa	i would def contact him|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	You have every right to contact him via his myspace page, but I do wonder why you weren't interested before now?  You have had 18 years to express interest and get to know him.<br>  <br>  My son was stolen via a coerced surrender that actually violated criminal code laws regarding abduction of a minor. I searched for him for 19 years, putting my name onto numerous registries in case his adoptive parents wanted to open the adoption, and even hired at PI when he was about 8 to try to find him. If I were you, I would have been trying to trying to find and contact my son.  Why didn't you bother until now? <br>  <br>  One obstacle you have already put in your way is that if you did voluntarily surrender him without having been coerced, then he has every right to feel angry and rejected about having been given away.  His reasoning (and the reasoning of 90% of society) is that, after all, if you had really loved him you would have kept him, right? People do NOT give away those they love.  Mothers in the animal world fight tooth-and-nail for their offspring unless they have rejected and abandoned them at birth.   Did someone convince you that giving him up was 'the loving option'? Sorry, sister, but they lied to you and you had better "follow the money" to find out who made a profit off of the adoption (agencies can make up to $25,000 or more off a healthy white infant).   <br>  <br>  Good luck in contacting him.  I think you were sold a bill of goods though regarding adoption. It *is* legalized abandonment and most mothers realize that we don't give away children we love -- we fight to keep them.  You may want to explore if someone convinced you otherwise or used a tactic such as open adoption to convince you to surrender your child.  I know many natural mothers whose children refuse to have anything to do with them as they feel their first experience in life was to be rejected by their mothers and adopted by people "who actually loved them."  We KNOW we loved and wanted our babies (most of us did anyway -- can't speak for "Dreamweaver" here who knew she did not want her baby), but our children may not know or believe this.|`|8LrnysX8aa	He may have reasons for lying about his age on myspace that have nothing to do with you. I would wait until he is actually 18 to contact him directly.<br>  <br>  When you do so, make sure that you make it clear that this is the only contact you will be making with him unless he writes back and expresses an interest in further contact.  Leave the ball in his court.  It's very scary being contacted by a birth parent.  You want to make it perfectly clear that you will not be stalking him or pestering him.  But, also make it clear that the lines are open whenever (and if ever) he wishes to communicate with you.  Also, don't mention the letter you already sent to his parents. Maybe they shared it with him, and maybe they hid it from him, but either way, it's best just not to mention it.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't respond after that, then I'm sorry, but he doesn't want contact with you right now, and you must respect his wishes.  If he does respond (whenever that might be -- it could be years later), then you two can proceed from there.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Whatever way you choose to make contact it is worth dong so no matter what the outcome.<br>  <br>  When I was coerced into surrendering I was told to forget him, get on with my life, I would never be allowed to contact him only he could do that but he would be 'too happy' with his adoptive parents to want to contact me.<br>  <br>  The law changed over the years but I didn't know that as I convinced myself he wouldn't want to kmow me.  I came across his details on Genes Reunited as he registered with his original name and I contacted him without thinking it through.  Fortunately he did want to know and had been searching for years.|`|XrEn3qOIaa	If you gave him up for adoption, I believe the key words are "gave him up". Ask yourself how would he react. Why did you put him up for adoption? He will ask that and many other questions..are you ready for that? Will the answers hurt him? <br>  <br>  Are you willing to deal with the consequences of contacting him? Have you thought about how will this affect him, and his relationship with his adoptive parents and family? and his life? his future relationships?<br>  <br>  What are your true reasons for contacting him..after all this years? Most times selfish life-wrecking actions can be made under emotional circumstances (stress, loneliness, guilt, neediness ,etc.)<br>  <br>  Nobody can tell you what to do, but perhaps you can seek Professional Counseling to help you make the right choice.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of websites on the internet where you can seek counseling and remain anonymous.|`|FXINmF6saa	If you are his birth mother yu should contact him and let him decide whether he wants you in his life or not. He is 17 and old enough to make his own decisions. And if his parents now don't want you to contact him it's probably because they've never told him where he truly came from. Try to contact him just be careful don't come in too drastically remember this is your first attempt in 17 years he might not take that very well. Talk to him more as a friend more then a parent remember he already has parents.|`|nIFV6kSOaa	I say, it won't be long until he is 18 and wouldn't be surprise that any teen would fudge their age up a few months and try out the freedome before they are entitled. Thank goodness he isn't 13 and saying he is 18 if I found that I would find his parents to let them know. It just seems it can't be that long until he is an adult and his aps can't control his world.|`|Afoabqblaa	It's an open adoption, but you haven't asked for a pic or info on him in almost 18 years?  Wow, your concern for your offspring is inspiring!  Yeah, he needs you like a hole in the head.  If you make contact, you need to be damned sure you plan on sticking around in his life, not just feeding your own curiosity.|`|SWLLxANWaa	Do seek the advice of an attorney and a Professional counsel er, 17 years seems like a lot of time to waste if you really did want a relationship with your "son". Pardon me, but parents are the ones that take the time, effort and sacrifice to raise their children. Not the ones than comfortably watch them from the distance...and then conveniently come to "reapa' the fruits of the adoptive parents labour. Where were you when he took his first steps? came back from his first day at school? or first date? How many bills did you pay to fix his teeth? or to pay for anything, for that matter?|`|xwZKouCIaa	Definitely NOT he is 17 years old not legally an adult yet so if his PARENTS dpont feel that its appropriate for you to contact him and they havent reliped to you as of yet, take that as "No" they are his parents and if they wanted you involved then they would have let you kno so by now... im sorry but i dont think its right for you to reach out to him without HIS  PARENTS  consent|`|sbHJCxWCaa	yeah, i'd contact him. it's myspace, people get contacted by totally random strangers. if he doesn't want to talk to you, he's old enough to decide.|`|HaNOmXaEaa	Oh God, I hated that. My birth dad sprung a myspace attack on me, and after that I chose to cut contact completely.<br>  <br>  Be careful with this.|`|Of7KEsnXaa	I say contact him on the public site and sese what happens.<br>  <br>   I recently found my brother on myspace.|`|YZcYAJJdaa	i think it's best to contact him<br>  I wouldn't wanna live not knowing and questioning who my mother is

Everyone has a birthday.<br>  <br>  First, there's always a birthday boy/girl. thats who the party is centered around. <br>  Second, when you see him/her, wish them happy birthday, what your really saying is i hope this birthday is a happy one. <br>  Next, you always get a present. Now kids love presents, its the best part of having a birthday. You can get them anything, but the trick is to get them something they like.<br>  Lastly, cake. every birthday boy/girl gets a cake decorated with their name and flowers maybe and definitely candles! balloons are important for decoration and so are party hats. when everyone is gathered around to watch, the birthday boy/girl blows out the candle! Hooray!<br>  <br>  <br>  Does that help at all?!|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	my son will be 2 in may<br>  <br>  these are some things i have considered for him:<br>  having his party at the park<br>  going to one of those play places with the moon bounces and stuff<br>  petting zoo / pony rides<br>  <br>  if you have any friends or family members with children around you child's age, invite them!|`|l7U9dGrWaa	you could have a party though not at your house if you ever want it to be the same again you could take him swimming or to the zoo.|`|tAb06i8yaa	rent a jumpie. get goodie bags. a cake. keep it simple. play a few ''little kid'' games... just whatev

4ThvQYi9aa	It's really up to you. Most women who go into labour not wanting an epidural...change their minds halfway through:) But If you decide that its really what you want then I would say go for it!! Women were doing it for thousands of years and we're all here! so that says something. I haven't had a baby yet but when I do I think its the way I want to go. I think you should make a clear decision before hand because most doctors at the hospital try and push you to do an epidural. I think its totally creepy. I think I would be really uncomfortable with not being able to feel half by body plus I've heard that the freezing effect can also effect your baby. Good luck with whatever you decide and congrats!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	It was such an amazing feeling. Read "Ina May's Guide to Natural Childbirth" by Ina May Gaskin. At first I wanted a natural childbirth but was open to an epidural if I could not take it. After I read this book, I knew a natural birth was the only way wanted to go. Focus on your breathing and on something small (and not the clock!), welcome the contractions, completely relax your body and just let your body do what it was made to do! It is an amazing thing out bodies do.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	It all depends on how you handle pain. For me my first sons birth was completely natural and not all that bad. My water broke when I was turning over in bed. Then the contractions started we drove to the hospital. The contractions weren't bad at all just like bad cramps then I felt like I had to push. After 3 hours of labour and 20 minutes of pushing I had him. The worst part was getting stitches because I tore.<br>  <br>  I had my second son at home in my bath tub (planned home water birth). The contractions this time around were A LOT more painful, but only lasted for an hour and I didn't tare.<br>  <br>  So over all natural childbirth for me is not that big of deal. I would rather give birth than deal with any sort of bad injury (broken bone for example)|`|JZnRxPUCaa	Very painful... I have had 3 babies, the first 2 natural and the 3rd with an epidural. <br>  Just to give you a comparison on the difference, with my 3rd birth (w/ epidural) I was actually able to concentrate on the birthing process and actually enjoy my experience.  I saw the babies whole birth, from his head coming out and then the rest of his body.  It was so much nicer to relax and enjoy birth!<br>  As for my natural births, my first one was at 18, I was  very nervous and scared! But, I just had to breathe through my contractions, and honestly after my little boy was here I forgot all about the pain.<br>  And then with my 2nd child, I had her naturally, and again the same pain, if you have a really high pain tolerance it can be easy to get through it. You just have to breathe, and I highly recommend taking Lamaze classes.<br>  And truthfully, having an epidural was not really giving birth the "easy way"  I was so honored that I was actually able to experience the whole birth and not be in pain.  If I could have my first 2 over again, I would opt for the epidural. It made things so much easier and so much more amazing to experience.<br>  Either way you choose, congratulations and best wishes!!!|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Both my son and daughter were born natural.  It is painful, but the great thing is up until you hit transition you have breaks between contractions to rest and recoup.  For me contractions didn't really hurt until I was 6-7 cm dilated.  After 7-8 I hit transition where they came one on top of another which was incredibly hard to deal with.  I went from 7-10 in an hour and you'll know when you are ready to push.  It will be an unbearable urge to bear down and the pain will go from your uterus down to your vaginal area where it burns.  They call this the "ring of fire" and let me tell you, that is a very appropriate name!  Delivering the baby is the most INTENSE pain but is the shortest.  Its all worth it in the end!<br>  I went so fast both times I didn't have time to get the epidural.  As soon as I asked for pain meds the nurses told me I was ready to push and they don't give pain meds when you are already 10 cm dilated.|`|nah8tOF6aa	Ok listen to me and listen good. I thought I was going to be like you and have my baby naturally, but I was wrong. It hurt SO much I thought I was going to die from the pain so I had the epideral. Having the epideral was the best thing in the world. I dialated much faster and had my baby within an hour. Using the epideral is great. There is nothing wrong with using help to have a child.<br>  <br>  congrats|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I was screaming for a section right before his head popped out. I was stuck at 8 cm for a few hours....<br>  <br>  He had a big head. My mom helped me do modified Lamaze (I could NOT do anythinhg other than the deep ones).<br>  <br>  Honestly, the contractions were the worse. Once I could push, I felt no pain. Plus once he got settled I could take a shower!!|`|J4YNRrsuaa	I just had my first baby 6 months ago. Yes i also avoided an epidural, my reason was because it was more riskier for infection and didnt want a catheter. So i had him naturally no meds at all. IT was not as bad as i expected and i think you should definetly do it also. Its better because without the epidural your body naturally pushes the baby out, it was an amazing feeling. Instead of pushing... the doctors kept telling me to stop pushing but my body was automatically doing it, they said that happens when you dont use an epidural. It was a great experience the delivery was so simple even though i was in labor for 50 hours, but stay home as long as you can before you go to the hosp its much better like that. I recovered in 2 days i was able to move around and clean and do usual stuff. I had to get 12 stitches also. That part hurt alot worse then giving birth!!! Just think your body is meant to do this. It was so much simpleler and less painful then i expected, once you start pushing you really dont feel pain anymore, the contractions like go away.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	Hi, I had a drug free child birth with my first daughter.  It is not that bad as everyone think it is.  I started to have contractions around 5 o'clock in the morning and went to the hospital about 8 o'clock.  In the hospital I walk around in the maternity area till nurse wanted me to sleep so she can give me IV and Monitor mine and baby's heartbeat.  In the afternoon around 2 o'clock I was only dilated 2 cm, so doctor told nurse to give me pitocin to induce the labor faster.  Afterward my contraction got faster and closer and it started to hurt and nurse offered my epidural few times but because I took Lamaze classes I used the breathing technic which help me a lot and deliver my daughter at 8:55pm that night without any drug.  <br>  So if you really want to deliver baby without any drug I would suggest you to take Lamaze class.  It really helps.  Currently I am 36 week pregnant with my second one and this time also I am doing drug free labor.|`|Sz8KiJuvaa	i went in knowing i was going to get the epideral. i was induced so my water had to be broken. i tried to put off getting the epideral as long as possible so i turned it down when they offered it to be before my water was broken. within 5 min of my water breaking the contractions came hard and fast. but after the epideral i was able to enjoy the rest of the labor process without screaming and being in constant pain. im sure it was more enjoyable that way for my husband and the nurses as well haha. only thing i didnt like was not being able to move my own legs to turn over because of the numbness but it wasnt really that bad. i knew i was going to get it but i was still scared before hand...but it was a piece of cake to be honest. everyone is differnt though its really up to you how you want the birthing experience to be.|`|AA10615926	I have done it both ways... my first was with no pain meds at all.  My water broke at home and my labor was 5 hours start to finish.<br>  <br>  My 2nd was induced (we needed to plan for someone to watch our oldest and we live 3 hours from our closest family) I got an epidural and hated it!  I couldn't move the right side of my lower body for 4 hours after the delivery!   my labor was 7 hours start to finish.<br>  <br>  If I had to do it all over again I would not have gotten the epidural, I loved that I could get up and walk around right after my first son was bored.  I hated being stuck in the bed unable to move after my 2nd son was born|`|t44168wJaa	getting an epidural is not the easy way there is no easy way i got and epidural with both of mine the first one was a very long labor so i was really exhausted, getting the epidural at that point was so i could have the energy to push, my second one i had an epidural but it didn't work i was pretty upset at that point but luckily my labor was only 12 hours instead of 24|`|KYkoPHpsaa	I was able to enjoy the delivery with the epidural instead of screaming throughout labor, really i would recommend it to everyone as bad as that sounds. . .|`|7N4AtRogaa	I don't think the method is as important as the end result.  If I can get the same results without all the pain, i'm all for that.
NUmeIxyfaa	had the same problem. Mine stopped the nagging after about 2 years. <br>  <br>  Which means that we have been 2 years and counting with them minding their own business!<br>  <br>  Good luck and stand strong!|`|JivuAmfiaa	I too found I had this problem with my in-laws. They are very religious and criticize me for not taking my kids (who don't believe in God anyway) to church. I just found it best to calmly explain to them that I wasn't going to force things on my kids that they don't believe in. I don't think a 6mth old would get anything out of it anyway, he'd probably get bored and restless just sat there. Hope I helped!|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	i would tell her to shut up. it's not like he is gonna learn anything anyway. when i have kids i won't be taking them either.|`|VHHis05Naa	Ignore her.  This is your choice to make, she made hers.  Raise your child how you want to.  You absolutely cannot give in to this.  She likely just wants to show off her grandson, but pictures can do that just fine, too.  Don't let her bully you!|`|AA11210211	Tell her no thank you and ignore the nagging,My hubby's aunt(big holy roller) has invited us to church on numerous occasions and I simply say no thank you.|`|qayCggxMaa	Ok, I'm not an atheist or agnostic (I'm Catholic actually), but I've seen most of my sibling drop by the wayside, so I have a little insight.  Does your mom think YOU still go to church?  If this is the case, then you at some point have to face being an adult who makes her own choices and tell your mom you no longer go.  Because I'm not sure why she would think you would take your 6 month old if you don't regularly go to church yourself - Unless this is a prelude to the "get your baby baptized" nagging, since in a lot of churches you have to regularly attend in order for them to baptize your baby.  Those are the only things I can think of, because in my church we don't really expect kids under 4 or so to sit through church - that's why there is a nursery there where you can drop your kids off during mass.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	we are just like you.  we have a 3yr old that my mil takes to church with her but we only let her do it because our daughter likes to go, she just recently started taking her about 2-3mths ago.  just tell her that you don't think it is the right time & that maybe when he is 2 or 3 she, your mom, could take him but you are unwilling to go if you let him go with her.  <br>  i totally feel the same way about going to church, most christians are the biggest hypocrites i know.  i have lots of family that is like that.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I'm neither atheist nor agnostic - spiritual is what i call it.  don't take my kids to church but i teach them what i believe.  well my MIL doesn't like it nor understands it.  she gave my kids bibles for christmas.  yup that was what she choose to let her only grandkids open on christmas morning, a bible.  i guess since i am "heathen" she doesn't want her grandchildren to be one too?<br>  idiot, opps i mean lovely woman|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I would tell her to back off this is your child. <br>  <br>  lol My mom freaked out when I was pregnant with my first because I wasn't going to get him baptised! This was the conversation.<br>  <br>  Me: No I'm not baptizing him.<br>  Mother: What? So I'm going to have a heathen for a grandson?<br>  Me: Haha. I'm going to let him grow up and let him decide for himself.<br>  Mother: but your catholic you should get him baptized!<br>  Me: I'm not catholic<br>  Mother: yes you are! you were baptized!<br>  <br>  lol she doesn't even go to church and I haven't went since she forced my siblings and I to go, which was when we were like 10.
SRsFkNBBaa	i think she would be fine. my 13 year old has cancer right now. he has burkitts lymphoma, and he is in stage 5. ( or was when they found it) part of it was found in both kidneys. he hasn't had anything removed though. but the first thing all of the oncologists have said, over and over, is to treat them and encourage normal child behavoir. if your doctors have never said anything about not letting her do it, i don't see the problem. there are tons of athletes that have things like that. in fact, that pro swimmer, only has one kidney. i don't think it would be a problem. if it makes you feel better, get a different doctor (good idea, if he isn't listening to you) and see what they say. where did she get her treatment, if you don't mind me asking?<br>  our son has been treated in peoria at the childrens hospital and st. jude clinic (we also live in peoria luckily). my husband and him leave for memphis sunday for the st. jude clinic down there,. because they found another tumor. anyway- my point is , the oncologists we have here are awesome. very thourough and they encourage questions. they are really exact with things. in fact, all through this process they wouldn't tell one of us something, unless the other was there too. only becuase they said they have problems sometimes with family memebers relaying the wrong message. they are great. good luck, whatever you decide.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Well, that is a tough one. Even children with two kidneys get seriously injured in sports. However, she has to be able to live life.... hmmm. I'd find a new doctor and ask him/her.|`|Maepb9yraa	I would say go ahead. We can live just fine with one kidney and that is in all aspects. Call her doctor if you have any question.

kUjUNSUSaa	All four of my children spent time in ICU / Special Care Baby Unit.<br>  <br>  My eldest daughter died in ICU following complications after a premature birth.<br>  <br>  My eldest son is absolutely fine despite also being a premature baby and spending two months in ICU. Average height, average weight, no developmental issues, does fine at school is a typical teenager.<br>  <br>  My youngest son has physical developmental delay. He is mentally as sharp as a knife but struggles with fine and gross motor movements. He was the only one of my four children not born early and went into ICU because of a chest infection when he was a couple of weeks old.<br>  <br>  My youngest daughter was also premature - she is small for her age but has no health or development issues. My husband's side of the family are slightly built so this is probably her genes anyway.<br>  <br>  My view is that it depends on the circumstances of the need for special care. There was a 10 year gap though between my first and fourth children and technology and treatment techniques had come on a long way in that time. Probably my son was always destined to have developmental problems and it is unlikely that ICU had any bearing on the outcome.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	My oldest daughter was in NICU (neonatal ICU) after she was born.

Perps often suggest to children shame and blame to keep them from talking, and right now you took the first step by writing about it.   Stop being a victim, tell your mom and dad and get that perp arrested!|`|X1NVjZEKaa	Maybe you should try councelling or something. It could really help.

It is important to you.|`|dB6MR0wYaa	in no way was it your fault. its normal  to be scared but you just have to push through and tell someone you trust|`|72BNu70Faa	It's not your fault what so ever. That never happened to me but it happened to my mother when she was young. You should really tell someone so that who ever did that horrible thing can be put in jail and they wont do it to you or someone else ever again.|`|pnppmAF8aa	u need to tell someone its not ur fault..if ur in school tell a counselor maybe they can help..get these sickos put in jail so it wont happen to u or no one else again...how old r u..tell ur parents..so sorry don't ever think its ur fault cause its not|`|tnQGOsaeaa	Please go talk to soemone, your parents or your school guidance counsler.

c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	Yeah I know what you mean my SIL and I have a 5 1/2 month baby and they are only a week apart and there always comparing them both my son and hers Like who does what first and so on. especially my MIL she just doesn't seem to understand that all babies are different and she always says stuff like "well my daughter's baby sleeps through the night" and since my does not she is always like get him really full or do this and that...like what does she care.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I dont think it's that they want them to grow up faster, they are just proud of their baby's accomplishments. I think youre right also that they are trying to find something to relate to you with. I get it, I hate when people just talk and talk and go on and on about "my baby this and my baby that" but I dont think you should be rude. Just politely excuse yourself, "oh sorry to cut you off but I gotta run!" and they will probably get the hint that you are not interested. Good luck!|`|sMukgX7Xaa	I am like you...don't want my kids to grow up at all. I say it sometimes, but I don't mean it. The only thing I wish for is that my 19 month old start talking soon...just b/c I feel like I have failed at teaching him this task. He is so super smart...just can't grasp talking yet...still working on it.|`|SjX72fPyaa	I think the reason why the majority of people want their kids to grow up so fast is because their so excited to see their child reach all of the milestones such as walking, talking, able to hold their own spoon while eating, etc. <br>  I can relate to that thinking in a way. My daughter will be 5 months old in 5 days and I can't wait for her to start crawling. Mostly because I want to see the look of achievement on her face. And I'll admit, because I won't have to carry her everywhere she decides she wants to go lol. But at the same time I don't want her to. Because it means that shes that much older and that much closer to not being a baby anymore. <br>  So I've come to the conclusion that it would be great if she learned to crawl and walk and everything but stayed 5 months old lol. This is my favourite age!!|`|lZiwWAjkaa	I'm in no rush to make my 6 month old grow up fast either but I am getting him to learn to read.  This isn't for me or anyone else, it's so he can be smarter than other kids and potentially advance in his grades.  There is nothing wrong with me wanting him to be smart...|`|EUTRJqCsaa	same here. it's exciting when he does something new, but I'm not rushing it. I want him to stay little =).|`|14GS7T7jaa	I hear you... Im soo happy when my lil one learns something new but at the same time im so sad because she is getting so much older and i dont want her to grow up.. i wish she was a newborn again so she snuggles nice... now i got a crazy 9 month old that wont stay still lol...<br>  <br>  It it a HUGE competition... i have 3 friends that have babies.. a 9 month old..7 month old and 6 month old... the one thats 9 months was born 4 days before mine.. and we had the EXACT duedate.. its been a huge competition between who does what first.. or who gets the most gifts or better gifts... its stupid... let babies b babies...they grow wayy to fast|`|3K7ffKn2aa	they will be children no matter what they can do a 1 year old is still a 1 year old reading or not, potty trained or not. Some just want their child to be independent and learn how to do things for themselves. Children who read at an earlier age usually have better scores and actually like it more. Its not about making them grow up its about giving them an advantage. Some one could ask you "why are you holding your child back that way?" Its just a matter of how each person looks at it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	While I don't agree with the comment you made "oh wow thats why hes so fat." I do agree that people are in a rush to make their little ones grow up sooner than later.<br>  <br>  I follow my son's cues. Always. If he's ready for something, great. If not, oh well.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Because they didn't realise when they bore them- that they'd be SO hard to raise!    :)
dB6MR0wYaa	you should go see a doctor because you couldve hyper-extended it or even torn something. it will only get worse if you dont get it treated|`|MNws22r5aa	Try RICE.<br>   Rest<br>   Ice<br>   C( I don't know lol)<br>   Elevation|`|oGHtaaCkaa	Keep it still and don't bend it!<br>  Wrap it. <br>  Maybe go to the doctor over the weekend or asap.|`|7wwLbWN1aa	Knees are a very, very tricky joint and should be looked at immediately. I highly suggest you go to the doctor this afternoon, if you can. If not, wait until tomorrow afternoon for any improvement and go to the ER if it's still bothering you.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, keep hydrated, take a few Tylenol, and place a heating pad on it. :)|`|gPg7qYGIaa	get something cold out the freezer and put it on there keep off it as much as possibly trust me i have a bad knee if cold dont help try a hot water bottle|`|BZqjBPBvaa	don't do anything that will worsen your knee..|`|ou0sh511aa	Here are your possible choices and you pick which one most likely fits you. PERSONALLY I THINK YOU HAVE A TORN ACL. see a doctor<br>  <br>  Hyperextension- Hyperextension is a straightening movement that goes beyond the normal, healthy boundaries of the joint. example: Bending the knee back the wrong way. <br>  <br>  Torn ACL: A critical ligament in your leg torn either by bending the knee backwards or having it twisted side to side: Most likely happens when you plant your foot on the ground and a sudden force hits your knee causing it to be torn this may require surgery. Hard to bear weight.<br>  <br>  what may help is the RICE treatmeant<br>  <br>  Rest-rest your knee don't walk around much <br>  Ice- Ice may help if its just a severe sprain but it can also help your ligaments if torn<br>  Compression- keep it compressed this may help your knee to not further injure itself<br>  Elevation-keep it elevated like if laying on a couch raise it up on a couple of pillows
cYHgnqQ9aa	So I'm guessing your a newbie TTC right?<br>  <br>  Ok, first of all chart your menstrual cycle and every morning chart your body temperature with a basal thermometer, when your temp. rises you are ovulating. To conceive ideally you have your fertile days to baby dance and the day of ovulation.  It is better to baby dance every other day around your fertile days as it is said that sperm need 24 hours to regenerate and your partner will have a higher sperm count.  He should not masturbate the days you two aren't baby dancing.  He should wear loose cotton boxer shorts and avoid hot baths and saunas.<br>  You both should refrain from alcohol, smoking or caffeine...both around your fertile days and you for the time you are trying.<br>  Anyway... good luck and lots of baby dust to you!|`|LBg4DNpCaa	It might take a while it took us 5 months to get preggo. Good luck!|`|5Ppmmy4qaa	best thing to do is count 10 days from your first day of your last period and and have sex from day 10 to day 19th. that will get all the days in. sperm last up to 5 to 7 days and it takes the egg 48 hours to drop. it can take up to 3 to over a year to get pregnant. don't get disappointed everyone is different. gl and baby dust<br>  if u need more help e-mail me your first day of your last period and i'll count for u to start u out. i have helped two other people get pregnant on here. gl|`|0jpep8S9aa	Just keep doing what you're doing and don't give up... Healthy couples only have a 20% chance of conceiving per month when doing everything correctly.
a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	Whoa.  You need to relax.<br>  <br>  If your husband doesn't have sperm count issues, why not have sex more often?  Geez, have fun with it.  Fun?  Remember that?  Had any lately?<br>  <br>  You haven't really been trying long enough to justify hardcore fertility treatments.  Give it, say, six to eight months.  Try to really enjoy it.  The first orgasm you have (if you have multiple ones in a session of intimacy) pulls sperm deeper inside you and makes it easier to conceive.  But if you have a second one, it can sweep sperm out.  (Weird polygamous biology at work.)<br>  <br>  Focus on being happy and in love and being prepared for whatever happens.  Stress is not going to help anything here.  Even if you need some fertility treatments, this is still a natural thing you're doing here, not some trend to chart and graph and measure out.  It's not statistics class.  You're not getting a grade on this.<br>  <br>  Work on being secure in whatever fate brings to you.  Whether it's a baby or just great sex and a strong relationship, it's good!  Find what's good about your situation and try not to focus on what's lacking.  <br>  <br>  And remember--hormones can make you kinda crazy.  Try to work out what's really your thoughts on the situation and what's your hormones.  They whisper in your ear, make your uterus go all flippy-floppy.  Hormones can drive you freakin' crazy.  Make sure you listen to YOURSELF, not just the chorus of biochemicals that are urging you to procreate at any cost.  <br>  <br>  You are more than your body, your biochemistry, your relationships, your children.  Settle down a little and celebrate yourself and the journey a little.|`|oHNrktxTaa	O honey, I really do feel your frustration. I am also TTC my first & know how stressful this can all be.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, I do like the Clear Blue Easy digital OPK sticks. I find it useful & easier to read than the ones with the lines & comparing pink in color. I know they can't get you pregnant, however, it does pin point  & determine your LH (lutenizing hormone) surge prior to ovulation. I have used them 2wice, so far & no such luck. <br>  <br>  However, I also turned to the Clear Blue Easy Fertility Monitor. This is my first month using:) It should be interesting to compare & see if the OPK sticks & the monitor both track my high peak days to be the same. I have a 24-25 day cycle & the OPK sticks read that day 11 I have a LH surge. So far I am on day 9 with the monitor & still don't have any high/peak days. I shall see....<br>  <br>  I have friends that have used both the sticks & the monitor & have gotten pregnant! So, it is just a suggestion. It helps to increase your chances on becoming pregnant. I would ttc every other day during the fertile period/week.<br>  Since the monitor is a little pricey, why don't you try the OPK sticks first? <br>  Other advice I have is to try to relax, stay calm, & be positive. It will happen! I truly believe that it has to do with timing.<br>  <br>  Sending you TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Keep me posted:)<br>  Good Luck!|`|5Ppmmy4qaa	first off i'm sorry to hear its taking so long. god plans all for us. and in good time things will happen. after my M/C i read up on what and when to do it. since then i have had two great pregnancy. the book said to have sex on day 10 after your first day of your last period and have sex from day 10 to day 19th. everyother day or everyday. my husband and i did it everyday its only 9 days. the sperm last up to 5 to 7days inside of u and it takes the egg 48 hours to drop. this gets all the days in. my hsuband and i did this two times i now have a 3yr old boy and 6 1/2 month old twins. it does work just takes time. if u like u can e-mail me the first day of your last period and i'll count for u and get u started. i have helped two other people on here. gl and baby dust|`|dNlCfhD2aa	I know this isn't what you want to hear, but I think you just need to give it more time.  <br>  Have you been observing your cervical mucus?  Clear and stretchy mucus means ovulation is or is abt to occur.<br>  Stress can also delay ovulation so try to relax.  I wish you the best of luck.|`|ffnne6O1aa	The problem is you are checking calendars when your period is irregular.<br>  Trust only your cervical fluid, the temp just gives you an idea of when you are ovulating every month. by the time it rise it is too late to conceive.
454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	Eeew, it would totally weird me out if my dad talked about my period.|`|JVPt99Hxaa	my dad has never said anything to me about my period|`|QGP930C6aa	that would really f*** me off cos i dnt think its that big of a deal either. i'm lucky though as neither of my parents are like that but i can see how it can really annoy you. if soemone kept doin that to me i'd just be really snappy and sarcastic with them.|`|7wwLbWN1aa	It's part of nature. Your dad help conceive you... he knows how that stuff works! I just don't see how it's weird.<br>  <br>  I mean, I'm not going to make a point to go talk to my dad about my birth control or tampons, but I don't hide anything from him.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	That would totally weird me out!  It would really annoy me, too, if he blamed every little thing on my period.  I guess I'm lucky my dad doesn't talk to me about stuff like that, haha.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	He doesn't make it seem like a bid deal , you do. He's trying to be closer to you but he's a guy and doesn't know what to do or say.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	Lol i think he's just trying to be nice/understanding, just tell him my gosh stop being weird!|`|iwUInpC1aa	I have talked to a lot of children, Boys & Girls, about all aspects of human reproduction.

But im lucky b/c i know i can always go to my mum or step-mum and my sister knows she can come to me :)|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	Does he think periods are some sort of disease or something?|`|Uo0b2aShaa	your step dad has problems what does it matter to him if your on your period anyway|`|6iRWWHRUaa	Ask him if he's impotent.|`|AA11346983	yes, a lot. i don't talk about it but my parents seem to bring it up at every possible occasion..|`|p25p9jTYaa	my dad never does that, but he DOES talk about boys and bras, it sucks!|`|Ph1NzLTqaa	is 'weirded out' really a phrase???  Why shouldn't he mention it, would you be offended if he asked if you had a headache or indigestion or asked if you feeling okay becuase you were a bit quiet, or asked you if you were feeling okay as you were looking pale?  Periods are just another part of the body and menstruation is quite natural, and adult men don't have a problem with this and talking about it, it's no big deal, you are just feeling awkward as you are young and it's all new to you, but really you stepdad is just being open - why should he ignore it and act as if it's something to be ashamed of when it's the most natural thing in the world?|`|qEPr0FOCaa	I actually never told my dad that I have it, and im pretty sure my mom hasn't said anything to him either (and im 15)<br>  <br>  Except, I think he knows because this summer, I had to get major surgery so I had to take 'a test', and my mom said 'well she can't be pregnet, she has her period!' and my dad was like 'uhhhhhhh.....woah' hahah|`|vQuoI4VJaa	it is kinda weird. whenever my dad tries to bring it up (im 27) when he comes to visit I tell him to shut up because my son is ten and doesn't need to know about that yet. but ya I would tell him not to bring it up because its embarrassing|`|ifHTyEI9aa	My step dad does than same thing to me . I learn to deal with it or nicely ask him to stop ... you know when your off . Or just scream at him when you are ... and blame it on your moodiness . I do it all the time to my step dad ... lol|`|72BNu70Faa	My dad refused to even listen to me and my mom talking about periods lol|`|a8tCObqraa	no in my family were very open and make a joke out of embarrassing situation so we don't get embarrassed :)<br>  <br>  hope this helps good luck x|`|ggBxkukFaa	You sound REALLY young!! sorry... but most men are quite understanding of these things! How old is your stepdad? 10?? Sorry to tell you this but adults ALL know about periods.. :-)|`|cTM07yNwaa	lmfao yes,<br>  id rather talk to my mom :P <br>  and deff not a step dad.|`|oQL9eDNAaa	My dad doesn't talk to me about periods :P|`|7MveAFYxaa	why so what he is ur dad its no diff to mom
os36Q3P2aa	congrats ...<br>  it sounds like an infection maybe..i had similar after my 1st baby  (i also had a laceration).if it was just fluid it may be different but because theres an odour i would suggest you call your gp and get it checked <br>  <br>  good luck <br>  xx|`|1S7uXsInaa	Sound like an infection of some kind.  You want to have this looked at because infections, especially in the bladder region can lead to a lot of other complication in women.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If it smells bad you need to go to the doctor and check for uterine infection, it is not uncommon after delivery and could risk your life if not merely your fertility.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Leaking fluid? Doesnt sound good, id go to the doctors
hmOidFp3aa	If there is ANY sort of line it means that you are. The tesats are only 99.9 percent accurate because of the chance that it missed something. But nothing else can make it turn positive, even the faintest line means yes (unless you are reading it after the indicated time for the test) <br>  Good luck :)|`|VS8mactUaa	Sorry all indications are you are pregnant, no matter how faint the lines, a positive is still a positive. Congrats I guess|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	Go to the doctor and get a blood test.  If you can't afford a regular doctor, go to a community health clinic or family planning center.<br>  <br>  Whether you're pregnant or having some kind of hormonal issues, you need to know.  Don't leave your answers up to drugstore tests.
cnK4X2sZaa	i dont think i have to tell you how important it is for you to be together..... and you have to check with the airline... some wont allow women who are close to term, in case they go in to labor. but if she has a low risk pregnancy, and the doc approves you should be fine. im pretty sure you can travel at 35 weeks.|`|J3JClsuQaa	Well, I am sure that she would rather have you there during the pregnancy... I know she can't fly in the later months, but you can.  Maybe you could visit periodically, so the two of you can experience a little time together while she's pregnant|`|jgtfWjE4aa	you already posted this question a few days ago...under a different name and possibly profile...|`|wkd5CMNaaa	If you two are really commited to it, and both okay with the situation, then I think you guys can work it out. <br>  You should take classes together still, you could fly out for a weekend to see her, and do the weekend lamaze classes.
jG8b3Mz0aa	Well with a babby- use a frying pan over the head; works for me!<br>  <br>  With a BABY- maybe if you try loving the little guy or gal they'd hush, or try feeding the kid or changing the diaper, or maybe the tyke wants to be held.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Wow, it must be real boring under the troll's bridge tonight, they're all out!|`|7IHMjy2caa	Try feeding the baby, changing the baby, rocking the baby, in general taking care of the baby.<br>  <br>  If you can't handle that, give the baby to someone who can.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	ir really depends why your baby crying but giving your baby any drugs is not a good idea if it because of teething try bonjela|`|toqMrT25aa	Everything about this question screams TROLL .|`|zPYyGw8oaa	you can make babby shut up by feeding her, loving on her and not being an idiot :)|`|1i2HuDqmaa	What is wrong with you???!!! It's a baby, they cry. If it's crying it's telling u it wants something. it's hungry, or needs to be changed or just needs a cuddle. Don't drug your baby just to keep it quiet. That is sooo wrong.|`|4iXL4C6paa	why cant trolls ever spell baby right?|`|5bc904f09d573b29371603dab0caa809aa	Yes, definitely a troll... someone who's obviously craving attention..
CIZjK2rAaa	My aunt had a baby at 43.  It was considered a high risk pregnancy because of her age but she loved all the attention and getting ultrasounds every two weeks.  She gave birth to an 8 pound, healthy baby boy who will be one year old on Feb. 27.<br>  <br>  Your fiancee needs to discuss this with her doctor and begin taking prenatal vitamins before she conceives.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|d8fSVX23aa	I was diagnosed with early menopause at 39, with signs for about 3 years previously. Lucky I had already had the children that I wanted or otherwise I would of likely have had birth defects with any child conceived as my eggs are now out of date. To become pregnant is one thing but to deliver a healthy baby is totally another. Get her hormone levels tested now and if still good, get to it or start saving the eggs and freezing them. <br>  <br>  There is no history of this problem in my family, and to top it off scans show cysts on the ovary which until then i didn't even know I had which lower fertility.|`|a3da1bda5a289229e8f75cf00c867112aa	Chances are pretty good only if she has no hormonal imbalance, she ovulates on a monthly basis and her tubes are open. Her obgyn can check everything necessary. I am 37 and just got pregnant after a year of trying. I was also healthy and there was nothing wrong with me reproductively, so I started acupuncture in the month of January and here I am - pregnant. Good luck!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	I had my first baby at 36 and my second at 46.  Both planned, both routine pregnancies.  My doctor kindly didn't call me crazy.|`|Smy7Mwjsaa	this is common many women have babies during these ages my aunt just had quadruplets and she's 40 so trust me it can happen|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	nearly 100%|`|kaqPSgTVaa	They are ok...a little less than a decade ago but pretty decent. If you two are worried she can always go and get fertility tested.|`|qitXGd0qaa	Once a woman is 35, fertility starts to decline.<br>  <br>  She needs to visit her OB/Gyn before trying to get pregnant. They'll probably do some blood work to determine hormone levels and such.
9IFF0vIoaa	My baby is the same age & weight...and we just had a doc visit.  Doc said her weight is FINE.<br>  <br>  Sounds like her diet is healthy & varied.  I wouldn't change a thing.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	yes, this is perfectly normal! When she sees everyone else eating with utensils she might want to also... you can try just giving her a spoon (plastic) and let her experiment with it (with her food) she will grow to like it

I don't like Tatum for a girl. It sounds really masculine. Also probably because I think of Channing Tatum. I really like Lailah and the spelling too! It's lovely and makes it all the more unique. I don't like Cortlan though sorry :] but Annasophia is a nice name but I think it should have a short middle name or none at all because of it's length and syllables already.

aYCjy8Neaa	Make sure you think beyond just what the baby will need when you get home too. I made this mistake when i had my first son. You are doing to need things for yourself after you return home from the hospital also. Make sure you buy pads for when you run out of the ones they send home with you, tucks, dermoplast (numbing spray for if you get an episiotomy), breast pads, stool softener, rubbing alcohol for babies belly button. Those are some of the things you will need to make sureself comfortable after returning home. Also don't forget all the essential clothing and things like that that other moms posted already. hope this helps!|`|In2hruCdaa	I really wish more people would have answered this because I am quite curious myself.  I will give you my opinion even though I hav not had my baby yet.  I am due any day now.  But, I have lots of onesies...different sizes cause I have no idea what size she will be, as well as clothes.  I have various diaper sizes, all the bath stuff, towels, a few bottles, though I plan to breast feed, the carseat, a swing (they have to be in something when they are home,) a bassinett, millions of wipes.  Hmmm, thats all that I can think of now.  A charged camera...LOL!  I am due anyday now, so if something comes up and your question is still posted, I will get back with you.  Oh, I have a boppy also...I think that will come in handy....don't know for sure though.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	Yes, most new parents feel exciting when having a new baby and would like to prepare everything perfectly for their baby.  You will find my suggestion about the lists of necessary items in my blog here below.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://phawin.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://phawin.wordpress.com</a><br>  <br>  Besides, you can also shop all those items at the store here below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/necessary.items.for.a.new.baby-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/necessary.items...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yB5go5wbaa	lots of blankets. a swing. side snap shirts (like this [<a href="http://www.albeebaby.com/gerber-white-3-pack-side-snap-shirt-0-3-months.html]" rel="nofollow">http://www.albeebaby.com/gerber-white-3-...</a> instead of onesies (they're scary to put over their heads at first). I like my arm's reach co-sleeper too.<br>  <br>  that's about it, I needed stuff for myself more than for my baby (pads, hemorrhoid cream, nursing pads, UNDERWEAR).|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Lots of wipes!! I went through them like water....lots of undershirts cause in the begining you would be suprised how many blow outs we had lol, um other then the basics thats all that i can think of.|`|5ZvALiclaa	make sure you have a thermometer, spend the extra money and get a digital ear themometer that takes a reading in seconds as babies never hold still long enough to get a proper reading off the other ones. Having a thermometer always gives you piece of mind. As does having baby paracetamol in the house as they can start taking it from one month if its necessary.|`|acj9mB9Paa	A good baby sling.  I like a ring sling and a sleepy wrap.  I didn't NEED both, but I am sure glad I had both!!  I made all of mine though!  The sleepy wrap style cost me $6 for two (gave one to a friend) and the ring sling cost me about $20 ($7 for the rings and $12 for the fabric).  If you want info on where to find patterns, e-mail me!|`|AA11156135	Don't worry about it. 80% of what you bought at retail prices, - you won't even use.<br>  <br>  I had the twins (4 years ago) being bottled on the kitchen table with pot holders as pillows. The next day I bought carriers to feed them. We had them sleep on the couch for months after that.|`|1S7uXsInaa	Even if you are planning on breastfeeding, formula-even a small container-is a good idea just in case.  Easy to prepare meals for you and dad.  A pacifier, again just in case-you can always return if you do not use it.
4eTyCuRSaa	I got half way through this question... The man is an idiot.  He should have had a divorce by decree and sought to have the mothers rights rescinded.  He allowed it to go on for way too long.<br>  <br>  I really have no pity for anyone who refuses to take control of their live and then complains about it.|`|AA11828439	I lived this scenario. There is little the father can do. Heartbroken doesn't cover it. Mom's immaturity has permanently scarred the children and the father. I wish the father the best.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	First thing if I was the dad I would get a lawyer.  I would not sit back and let her take my kids away with out a fight unless she could proof it would better their life and I do mean theirs not hers.  If she wants to move fine but leave the kids.<br>  <br>  Now as a mom I can not imagine taking my kids away from their dad.  What this woman is doing is mentally abusing her children.  Parent alienation is real and wrong and that is what she is doing.  Doesn't sound like she grew up much to me she still wants things her way an not what is best for the kids.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I'm a mom of two boys, raised by my mother. My parents split up when I was around 6  b/c my father cheated and then married the women he cheated with. Dad was never around much, he spent more time with his new family. I saw him weekends and summers but he felt like a stranger to me. So did his new family. <br>  <br>  So... my mom ended up moving in with this boyfriend and we ended up moving out of state. 20 years went by before I saw my father again. He blamed it on my mom, for not telling him we were moving, but all my mom did to find him was hire a private investigator, who found him in less than a month's time. I mean, it was really easy. Which tells me that my dad could have easily found me if he'd wanted to. After all, I kept his last name. When I finally did find him, he died within 10 years times time. I missed him. I truly feel as if I didn't have enough time with him. <br>  <br>  Sooo... after all that... no, I wouldn't take my children away from a father who obviously was a good father and try to replace him. Kids deserve to see both parents, so long as those parents are healthy and have a healthy relationship with them (ie: not abusive or neglectful). Also, good parents have a legal RIGHT to see their children. All dad needs to do is get a lawyer. Sounds like mom is still holding a grudge. But people sadly are like that and even sadder is that it's the children who suffer.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no i wouldnt, i gave up a relationship for the sake of my daughter. her dad wouldve had to travel 6 hours there and back every second weekend which was unfair so no i wouldnt do it. if a fathers love is there it houldnt be trampled on. at the end of teh day once upon a time they loved each other and decided to have kids. alls fair in love and war|`|UYfqzCoMaa	First off I would NEVER be that mother because my children are more important to me than partying and living with all kinds of different guys. I would NOT take them away from their father because after all he is their father whether I would like it or not and no one can take that place. If they agreed on them not moving out of state then she needs to stick by it.|`|tBx1M0g9aa	Hell no If the dad wants them to he can still have custody i wouldn't move or get married id just be single for a while nd i would nto spoil my kids|`|6ErVPePEaa	I would never take my children from their father. Kids need both of their parents. I think that whole situation is a mess and I think the dad needs to go to court and fight it, if she is trying to take the kids away. It seems like the mom doesn't care about the kids, she is only doing that to piss off the father... It is never a good idea to separate kids from their parents, unless of course the parents are drug addicts or something|`|6VbNJOtfaa	That mother does not care about the kids; she is using them to hurt the dad.  He is the real parent in this situation and one day his kids will see this and he will get recognition he deserves.  The mother did something which I preach about on here all the time when people ask about when they should have kids- Do Not Have Kids Until You Have Had A Chance to be Young Yourself!  The mother in this scenario freaked out and became a hussy because she never had the opportunity to be young and have fun- she ruined her life with children instead.<br>  <br>  The dad is the good one in this instance.  He should never leave his kids.   There is no letting go, their life would not be normal without their father.  He has proven his love, and the mother is a real piece of trash.|`|vFZq7522aa	Okay my family was almost in this exact situation!! My cousins dad and mother got divorced! then they mom went and took them away from their dad and he fought for years to get them back in his custody!! He remaried, and she remarried. But the thig is that the moms new husband was severely abusive. My cousin was abused all the time and I think that she was sexualy abused but she has never told me that!! Then the mom kept making up lies about the father such as that the father had come to the house and tried to brek the door down when she wouldn't let him in!! <br>  <br>  So if I was the mom I would try to be better an take my children away from a father that cared for them and was supportive. I hope that this mom will do the same! Because most of the time the parents don't think what it does to the kids that have gone through a divorce!! My cousin that had to go through that being abused and away from her da is now totaly EMO!! that just breaks my heart because she wasa good little Mormon girl!

Sometimes when we feel like we weren't careful enough at some point, we can trick ourselves into having the symptoms. Though you have a regular period, three days is not that late. Even women with regular periods have an off month once in a while!|`|vygYFdsSaa	You could very well be pregnant, especially if your periods are like clockwork. Take a test!! Good luck.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	TEST|`|6wkcp8Xcaa	Look, you're only 3 days late. If you are really worried, take a home test. If you are pregnant, i don't think you would be getting any cramps or backache just yet... (i know i didn't), it might be just period pains coming on. I tend to get those symptoms all the time when i'm due for my period and i know i'm not preggers, as i've had the ole tubes done. Whatever way it goes, good luck...|`|4kG7MqqHaa	if your period is regular you should do the test, you can be pregnant.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	You should definitely take a test.|`|dAjLAB6saa	i would take a test|`|3tXvT13caa	yes you should your most likey prego
NS5fnxpNaa	My daughter was the sae way, it was so bad the Dr. put her on the formula and rice cereal and that didn't work then we went to soy and we tried goats milk, and then the Dr. told me about Nutramigan and that was the changing point she did great and she gained weight and so much happier. She weighed 5lb 3oz and by the time she was 3 mos she only weighed 6 lb something but after a mont of her new formulas she weighed 8lb. Good luck let us know how she is.|`|4kG7MqqHaa	i have a 5 month old baby boy, i had the same problem with him, he doesn't drink to much milk, like 3 or 4 oz every 5 hours.  i was worry about him and so i give him rice cereal in  the morning. on tablespoon with his formula so he eats like 2 oz . try that. do not give her the cereal on the bottle that can be wors. and if she doesnt feel like eat dont force her just wait until she show you that she is hungry,(they know when to eat)|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i was going to say it was a virus but if the dr already said its milk allergy. i would offer her milk like every 15 min just so she wont get dehydrated. offer more milk frequently. i think im saying it right. it may take a little bit for her body to adjust to the new formula. you may want to get a 2nd opinion.|`|qayCggxMaa	There's a good chance it is rotavirus.  Did she have a fever at any point?My daughter had rotavirus when she was 2 and she threw up constantly for 3 days, off and on every day for the rest of the week, and then occasionally for a week after that.  After the first couple days she would be hungry and eat in between throwing up.  My husband has a lovely story about how during this illness he gave her blueberries because she wanted them - then... imagine the picture you describe above but with blueberries instead of formula.  Anyway, thank goodness there is a vaccine for rotavirus now, but unfortunately your daughter is too young to have had all the doses to be effective yet (if she is getting it at all since it's still elective).

ALL contraception is free from your own doctor, who is also free to go and see (because of the NHS) and there are several different sexual health clinics dotted around every town, is there any reason so many should get pregnant then? NO, they do it on purpose for a reason (im not saying all, but with the amount there are with such readily available contraception, they must not be using it because it doesn't fail that often)|`|UgX3gUSJaa	Sometimes it lack of parenting, boys/girls dont have a mom or a dad to teach them about sex and the seriousness of it.

I know that sounds boring and I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but just take a moment and think about your baby before you give her a name.|`|8eZ4NkZmaa	I like Skylar for a girl, but I think it is more femenine spelled Skyler. I think it is too girly to be a boys name. I also think Skye can make a really pretty middle name but doesn't sound good as a first name to me.|`|p106IBuNaa	i like the other ideas that you can name her skylar and call her skye for short, but i also think its an adorable middle name. i know its weird, but i always loved "stormy skye" for a girl !|`|h4KogYO8aa	i like that name it sounds really pretty.<br>  and i have a best friend named skylar to.<br>  haha. :)<br>  glad i could help.|`|g3IXprk9aa	I think that Skylar sounds more masculine, and Skye sounds more feminine.

X9JSlC6Iaa	Answer above me, he has a whiner. He wants a sex change to a girl. Duh. Just tell them.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	If you want to then say so.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	LMAO! AWW no you don't i dont think you want a whiner|`|ki5hZbcTaa	that is a HUGE decision. Changing your sex isn't about hating your life, it's that you feel that you are the sex you are not meant to be. Like you were born a man but know that you are supposed to be a woman. If my child came to me with this, I would be kind of shocked. But I would want to support them and go to counseling with them to make sure that this is the right decision for them. There's no turning back once it's done. You also have to live as the opposite sex for so many years before a surgeon will even consider doing this.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	Just tell them. But let me tell you, it isn't easy being a girl, and once you're a girl, it will be a hassle to turn back into a boy.|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	You have to go through years of prep to do that.|`|cTM07yNwaa	tell them why you want it,<br>  be straight up and serious<br>  if they love you they will respect your wishes and help you out..<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|6AVRcwmzaa	think this through longer, your just a kid|`|tnQGOsaeaa	um. I think that you should tell them and hope they understand.
WoxMH0wZaa	I think you're doing fine! All As except for 1 B is great. Don't get hung up on the + or - thing because when you apply to college they don't see that, all they see is A, B, etc. and an A and an A- don't factor into your GPA any differently. So don't sweat. I know how you feel though....I went to a really prestigious high school and there was SO much of a focus on competition, it got pretty stressful.|`|ozATw7s0aa	Your doing really awesome! Keep it up :)<br>  <br>  You should be proud!!!|`|c2a0BgWraa	You're grades are wonderful! I love them. Keep it up. I went to public school and your grades are GREAT!!!|`|mfBkH3qtaa	You got REALLY good grades. I get C's and B's and A's on my electives. Don't let anyone bring you down. Theres always going to be someone in your life that is going to do that. Just learn to ignore them.|`|chfILbonaa	Your very smart and i think you are doing great but their is always room for improvement try getting your B+ in history to a A|`|I64JOuMKaa	Wow , congradulations on getting should good grades man !|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Oh no not another grade question !<br>  <br>  No, you should not think you are doing bad - because you aren't. Those are grades you should be proud of - and deep down I think you already know that.|`|Uo0b2aShaa	wow i wish i could get those grades!!!!|`|HFA05vDuaa	great!
iZk9jEBpaa	I've never seen that happen to a child and i hope i never do, you shouldn't have had to see that if it upsets you.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	As a little kid, probably I'd dry when I saw another kid getting spanked and knew I might or would be next.<br>  <br>  But at your age, I'd think you might feel sorry for the little girl who got spanked for not doing as she was told.<br>  <br>  Just hearing he word "spanking" as a soon to be reality for someone other than yourself, and since you don't actually know how to handle a real spanking ... I suppose you might feel like crying, thinking it is bad to be spanked for not going to bed when told to.<br>  .|`|SpYS7VYoaa	I just get really angry I was never hit as a child, or ever by my parents. My step mom hits my siblings, who are only little kids, all the time and she does it so hard it leaves marks(she started hitting them by the time they can walk, it disgusts me) So I guess crying could be considered normal. I get mad, you get sad, it just means that this sparks emotions in us becuase we strongly dislike it. I get angry even when she threatens to hit them.  So I'd say its normal.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	No, it doesn't make me cry but it is uncomfortable.|`|I64JOuMKaa	it wouldn't make me cry, but it does make me sort of uncomfortable to watch a kid getting spanked. Well if it's over and over again and im the only one in the room, yeah id feel uncomfortable. But if it was just one slap on the butt i'd probably chuckle cause they didn't listen .|`|XKYP0sGQaa	I don't cry, but it often saddens me. Especially when the child that is getting spanked is obviously upset. I think it's because as a child I was never spanked by either of my parents. Growing up, the only physical abuse I got was off my little sister.|`|cTM07yNwaa	that might be normal, maybe you just believe stongly that it is wrong to hurt them?<br>  even though spanking isnt that bad. i would never do it to my kids though aha|`|QmF1eNQiaa	I don't cry but I get sort of upset. It just makes you wonder if that's the least amount of abuse those kids get. You never know when some child is being abused at home where no one can see..|`|aiDV9FgGaa	When I was a kid, I would always smile if another kid got a spanking. I am an adult and to this day, it still makes me smile. I don't know why.|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	I am completely comfortable with spanking. I was spanked when i was younger, so it really doesn't bother me.|`|AA10375034	its normal. its ok. dont worry|`|2BhDBYDPaa	No i only cry when i get a spanking hehe;)|`|yFYFSjwcaa	i like the others it makes me smile i know im mean.

The girl was so sweet...I just couldn't stand her mom. and Kayla just kinda seems plain to me.|`|isZ8eb98aa	Ummm... none, really. But if I had to choose, Lauren. It's feminine, ages well.

Everyone says 'Just talk to him.' So cliche right? Yet, communication is something people can't seem to grasp right. So yeah, just be humble and understanding. Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot. Imagine all of the fearful thoughts running through his mind.

b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Unfortunately their are no guarantees.  It depends upon how much scar tissue there is from the ligation, what tube lengths you will have once it is done and how much scar tissue you will develop after the surgery.  I have known many women who have been successful even with very small tube lengths (like 3cm). The ideal lengths would be at least 7cm.  It sounds like you have a very good chance for a good reversal.  <br>  <br>  I was not lucky enough to be successful after my reversal and had to move on to IVF, but do not give up hope.

Yes, they might be trustworthy, but American highways are dangerous, and some drivers are crazy.|`|wENdWT5kaa	I wouldn't. She may be responsible, but are others? And especially for a city that is 4 hours away. She may be a good driver, but like i said above, are others? <br>  <br>  Honestly, she is to young. Maybe if it was about an hour away, but not 4.|`|I64JOuMKaa	how old are they?<br>  If they're like 19 or 17 then I think it's pretty reasonable.<br>  They're coming back in the same day, just spending some time in Chicago<br>  as long as you trust them and you're sure they're not gunna party and drink and actually not come back.<br>  <br>  And make sure the drivers a safe driver, if your daughter isn't driving.<br>  <br>  And make sure she calls in every couple of hours to check in with you.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  16 seems a little young .. still in highschool .. no adults .. lots of kids like to party nowadays.<br>  <br>  edit edit<br>  <br>  if she's really responible and you're sure then yes I would let her go.|`|AA10475412	Only time I will allow this is if there is plenty of adult supervision.|`|BySnX7Gvaa	Of course I would trust them and it sounds like you do you just needed us to give you a nudge let them go|`|ozATw7s0aa	How old is she?|`|5jQVj4Pfaa	I live an hour away from Chicago. Although my friends and I don't go to Chicago often, we really enjoy it and there are lots of people who go on the weekends at our school. They really enjoy it, too. I'm only 16, but I've gone there alone with two friends, ages 15 and 16. If they are responsible and you trust them, just makes sure they stick together and don't stay out too late. Otherwise, I'd say it would be pretty okay.|`|0c30f5fdc0cc17a33e0ba8fe4201b997aa	Is there anyway an adult can go with them? It'd be much safer for them that way. I don't think I would let my daughter go somewhere so far as a minor. I would at least go with her, or have an older sibling go with her.

xWg1krzBaa	Well, I am 6 weeks pregnant with my second child now. I surely want a baby shower, I had one with my first why not the second?  It's not like you got pregnant so you could have a baby shower, ya know? lol.   Not rude at all, it's to celebrate the baby and get help from your family and friends, people who want to support you and be there to help.  My family and friends would think it rude if I didn't want one, but that's just me.  Everyone is fighting over who gets to throw it so there will be more than one.  Sorry back to you. rambling. As for your little boy let him open your gifts, he'll love ripping the paper to bits.  Have a special cake just for him that features his favorite cartoon character. An easy way to make him feel special is to go to Walmart, go to the party section and get him (once again his fav character)   a party hat, noise maker, things to that affect, he will look festive, be entertained and feel special.  Every child is different just because it's second born doesn't make this child any less important than the first born, do not feel guilty for having a baby shower for your second born.  No one said anything about expecting/wanting gifts, it's more about being surrounded with people who love you and the baby, not to mention the other child and if they come with gifts than accept them :)  Good luck, best wishes!<br>  <br>  Themes maybe use your sons character|`|xVTIjYreaa	I do not feel that there is anything wrong with a party for the second child.  When I had my second child my sister had a "Diaper Party" for me where in the invitations it was suggested for everyone either bring a pack of diapers or a box of wipes...I ended up not having to buy diapers until the baby was about 4 months old, and that was just inviting the closest family and friends, unlike my first baby shower.  Then with my third child I did end up having another baby shower mostly due to the fact that the first two where boys and the last was a girl, and because we had not planned on having another and had already gotten rid of everything.<br>  I am not exactly sure of a them, maybe a rubber ducky theme, that could be very cute, or even booties, or possibly even the same as the baby's room/nursery...but if you are sending out invitations make sure to write on there that everyone should speak to your 2 1/2yr old BEFORE seeing the baby, if you are not doing invitations, write a note and tape it to the door in a place  where everyone would see it before entering, that way he or she will feel special and not that the new baby comes first.  My first one was 4 when my second was born and I did the taping a note to the door and matter of fact left it there for a while so that for the first month or so when visitors came they would recognize my oldest and he wouldn't feel like people were only coming over to see the baby and not him.<br>  You could include your 2 1/2 yr old by letting him/her help decorate, and if he/she talks well enough as people greet him/her first, then have him/her introduce the new baby to the person/people.  just an idea.<br>  Hope this helps, and wish you all the best of luck!!!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I agree with you, i dont see anything wrong with having baby showers after your first baby. People dont need to go out and spend tons of money but a simple outfit or pack of diapers helps out the new mom a ton. Every baby is a special blessing and it should be celebrated...why should the first baby only get a special welcome? I would just have a welcome the baby party and basically have it just like a baby shower but the baby is already here. I would do a registry for the things needed such as diapers, wipes, summer clothes etc. Goodluck =)
0qP8gLpyaa	Sounds normal to me. My son wanted about 5 ounces at every feeding at that age and cooked whole grain cereal twice a day in addition around 4 months.  You'll find as they grow that their routines will shift around a little bit. It's OK.|`|w3ob12X6aa	no its fine my daughter is the same age and its probably because know she is completely full so she can rest now that she has a full stomach same thing happened with my daughter, perfectly normal|`|6x901MTeaa	24 ounces is the daily intake. My daughter kept acting hungry and used to drink up to 30 oz, but her pediatrician told me to bring it back down to 24 ounces.<br>  <br>  So if you're calculating a bottle every 3-4 hours, which should average out to 4-6 bottles a day, just make sure they are between 4-6 ounces. You are doing great since your numbers seem to be right there.<br>  <br>  With my daughter who is now 11 months, she still drinks the same amount, except in addition she has table food...<br>  <br>  Good luck! and Bless your little one =]|`|SrRafsqraa	Typically around this age it is about 4 oz every 3 hours (what my pediatrician told me)  My daughter would fuss a little after she was done with her bottle but I think she just wanted to keep drinking.  I was told to give her a few minutes to see if she would stop fussing by either distracting her or getting up with her and doing something else--and sure enough she stopped fussing really quick and wasn't hungry for another 3 hours.  She was just crying because she could keep drinking not because she was hungry.  Sometimes she will fuss when her bottle is empty but by the time I am done burping her she is perfectly fine.  Might want to try giving her a little bit to see if she continues to fuss.  Otherwise, like most moms say feed them and they will stop when they are full! :)|`|EZQIOIxxaa	newborns typically sleep 14 - 16 hours a day. seems like she's sleeping more because her hunger is being satisfied now.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	Definitely give her what she will take. If she's still hungry, she needs more. Seems like you are at the right amt to me.
Ot8lxaMEaa	I don't think so. If you feel it is necessary, you may have to pump and dump out your milk in order to keep up your supply. Your doctor can tell you how long the hormone would remain in your milk and how long would need to pump and throw away your milk before you can get back to nursing...So ask the doctor as he/she would be the expert on this.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I wouldn't think so.. A little advise, if you aren't ready for a second child get on the mini pill, aka P.O.Ps (progesterone only pill)|`|zPYyGw8oaa	I would think not...it is basically VERY strong birth control...I would ask your doc first.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It's progesterone, so it won't affect your milk supply. Progesterone-only birth control is generally considered safe, so PlanB shouldnt' be a problem.<br>  <br>  Kellymom says it's safe.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/birthcontrol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/birt...</a>|`|kbGOMwi7aa	Are you ready to be a mom?
aCUHzMrmaa	Very very little and do it towards the back. ALso put your hand up as a visor to shiled her eyes.  If you just use one or two spritz's it wont harm her hair.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Hmmm.  I don't think it will hurt her.  However, hairspray on a baby?  That's a little weird.  Can you use some gel so that at least you won't risk the spray in her eyes?  Or could you trim her bangs so they don't fall to eye level?|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I don't think it would hurt her hair, maybe just dry it out a bit. I would be more concerned about her scalp and the fumes she's breathing in.|`|BJ7WUkhVaa	my opinion i dont think it could hurt her my mom did it to me when i was a baby and nothing happend to me|`|dj00wdjKaa	I think you should just cut her bangs short so it doesn't fall over here eyes. Hairspray isn't a good idea. I would keep my baby away as much as possible from chemicals to prevent allergies and other types of irritation to its fragile skin. Unless, of course, you find hairspray or other products suitable or made for babies.|`|Yl3C9svGaa	I don't know if it is safe or not, but I wouldn't chance it with my daughter. She has curly hair, and we use a detangler for kids to help brush her hair. It is only a detangler, but it still does a good job to keep her hair where it needs to be.|`|cqVU2IjWaa	hairspray is safe unless shes putting her hair in her mouth all the time, or if you spray a large amount in her eyes, nose, or mouth.  its not going to hurt her hair now or in the future so i wouldnt worry about that.  good luck and godspeed|`|i1b4tgepaa	id say no because little kids seem to squirm (not sit still) so I would think its a bad idea.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Hair pomade will wash out and is not aerosol. I wouldn't reccommend for all the time. Maybe trim (not cut) bangs?|`|ROLakt2Maa	i would say she is a lil too young for hairspray. Wait till she is older.<br>  I suggest water instead|`|8t8NjjnVaa	I wouldn't subject a toddler to the chemicals in hairspray.  Even if you're careful to not get it in her eyes or on her skin, it still gets in the air around her and she's breathing that in.  <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is wet her hair, then put it in the position you want it.  If it falls back in her eyes when it dries, wet it again and put it back.  Do this several times a day, and at night before bed.  Eventually the hair will just naturally go that way because you've trained it to.  <br>  <br>  The other option is to cut it so it's not in her face.  <br>  <br>  Hairspray may not hurt her, but I wouldn't expose my child to unnecessary chemicals for an aesthetic purpose.  If you feel you must use some kind of product, use gel so you don't have the mist in the air from the spray.|`|1YHih8wyaa	I have been using hairspray on my daughter since she was around 8 months. She was born with a full head of hair. By the time she was 6 months old I could do ponty tails on her. I am now able to french braid her hair and she is only 1. I dont use a lot but because her hair is so straight sometimes i need some extra help. I hate using baby gel (the johnson type, you know the green bottle) because all it does it makes my daughters hair super greasy :o(|`|ArYvBhkpaa	My mom used to put a little bit on me,and I'm fine.
nU7qyXkVaa	Not a cure all, but reading a book with her about manners or sharing is one idea. Perhaps she doesn't understand the concept of sharing as she is an only child with no previous school experiences and may not have had to share before.<br>  <br>  An experience that seemed to click in a 4 year-old's head... He was being rude to me and I stopped him, held his hands, made him look at me and asked him (in a calm voice) "Would you talk to your grandmother or mother like that?" He thought about it and replied, "No." I asked, "Why not?" And he replied, "'Cause she'd put me in the corner and give me a whoopin'.(spanking)" I explained to him that he should talk to his teacher like he talks to his grandmother and mother.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps some. Good luck!|`|EGD10gkzaa	Being extremely tearful can be a sign of seperation anxiety. You need to set some rules with the parents, and have them evaluate her for this. Its not fair to the other kids for her to act this way, or to you or even herself.
8t8NjjnVaa	Regular soap is pretty drying to the skin.  You might want to try a body wash or baby shampoo that is a little gentler and may not dry the skin out so much.<br>  <br>  Or you could just use warm water and a sponge.  That would probably be best if you can clean her up with just water.|`|ArYvBhkpaa	i dont know|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	yes IVORY soap  99 44/100% PURE|`|lBbj5qOfaa	I would not get the baby wet, that can cause them to get sick. Use an old, wet wash rag that you can throw away after using. The doe should be able to keep up after you clean it. You need to keep an eye out for coccidiosis also.<br>  <br>     Definitely separate the doe and kids from the other goats. Make sure the doe's pen is clean and that she has plenty of fresh clean water. Keep the kids warm with a heat lamp if the weather is cold.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

q1YDp1y3aa	This is completely normal. Doctors give looser cuts now because they found that boys who were tightly cut (so that they looked circumcised as babies) grew up to have painful erections, bleeding erections, hairy scrotal skin pulled onto the shaft, even bent penises. Doing a second circumcision would greatly increase your sons risks of these problems after puberty. Having a little excess skin won't hurt him, but removing too much is very serious, and practically irreversible.<br>  <br>  Your son could also have a condition called "buried penis" (sometimes called hidden penis). This is extremely common in circumcised infants. It occurs when the penis retracts back into the fat pad, pushing the skin back over the glans. Boys normally grow out of this within a few years.<br>  <br>  In either case, pulling back the skin is important- if you don't, the raw edge can heal to the head of the penis, causing unsightly adhesions, skin bridges and scaring. you will need to continue doing this until he either grows so that the skin does not bunch near the head, or until he is old enough to push it back himself.<br>  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that almost all boys outgrow this condition. Your son will look circumcised by puberty, its really irrelevant what his penis looks like right now. -Neb|`|rFtKFp03aa	Since you had him circumcised I would say you need to get a 2nd opinion because of the current result.. <br>  <br>  It couldn't hurt, right?

There is nothing that can be done to resolve it at this point, he will either out grow it or if not it will require surgery.  If you can retract the remaining foreskin you should to prevent adhesions<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_1125.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_1125.html</a><br>  Who gets it?<br>  Boys can be born with a webbed penis, or the condition can result from an over-exuberant circumcision where adhesions form between the scrotal skin and the penile skin. Webbed penis usually causes no problems (unless a routine circumcision is later performed).<br>  <br>  Some children are born with a concealed penis (also known as buried penis or hidden penis), and for some it happens after circumcision. It is common in infants and toddlers, and occasionally seen in older children and obese adolescents.<br>  <br>  Children are not born with trapped penis; circumcision causes it. Routine circumcision of a webbed penis or circumcision when there is significant scrotal swelling (from a hydrocele or hernia) can lead to trapped penis.<br>  <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  A concealed penis is a normal-sized penis that lays hidden in the pubic fat pad. This condition is also called buried penis or hidden penis. Often the penis can be easily exposed by gently pulling on it or by pressing down on the surrounding fat pad.<br>  <br>  A trapped penis is a normal-sized penis that is partially stuck in the pubic fat pad. Scarring or adhesions trap the recessed penis in the fat pad. This condition can predispose children to urinary tract infections or urinary retention. Surgery is usually wise.<br>  <br>  All of the above conditions have a penis of normal size. In determining size, the "stretched penile length" is far more important than the "relaxed length." To evaluate penis size, stretch the penis gently and measure from the bone at the base all the way to the tip. Be sure to depress the surrounding fat pad to get all the way to the base.

There were eight patients (42%) with trapped penis, and all were complications of circumcision. (age 1 week to 7 months.) Of nine (47%) patients with buried penis, two had been circumcised prior to diagnosis.  One (5%) had webbed penis and one (5%) had combined buried and webbed penis.<br>  <br>  Intervention. Six trapped penises were surgically repaired, and two resolved spontaneously. Five patients with buried penis had surgical repair, and two are being followed up for probable repair at age 9 to 12 months. Two were not repaired because of medical conditions or parental concerns. The webbed penis was surgically repaired as was the combined buried and webbed penis. The repairs were all successful and had no complications.<br>  <br>  Conclusions. Inconspicuous penis encompasses a group of conditions in which the penis appears small but the shaft can be normal or abnormal in size. Circumcision is contraindicated in these patients until they have been evaluated by a urologist. Further study is needed to determine the natural history of these disorders and to better define which patients will benefit from surgical intervention and at what age.

The shaft of the penis is buried below the surface of the pubic skin. A true congential buried penis is rare. It is caused by an abnormally large pad of fat over the pubic bones and dense tissue that holds and pulls the penis inward. The skin of the shaft is pushed forward over the glans, giving the appearance of an unusually long foreskin. Circumcising an unrecognized buried penis can remove shaft skin as well as the foreskin, making the case even worse. If the penis was not buried already, removing too much shaft skin when circumcising can bury it by pulling it down into the pubic fat. A second circumcision may be incorrectly performed on patients with various causes of concealment, preventing repairs made by using the remaining shaft skin or foreskin. Instead the boy will need a skin graft.<br>  <br>  By: thirdkane, posted on SueEasy<br>  2008-04-26<br>  I'm a 35 y/o male with a lifetime disfiguration as a result of circumcision as a child.

It has effected my life negativly in so many ways, love life, school to where I missed years worth of school because i was ashamed of my disfigurment to avoid manditory showering with my peers.<br>  <br>  Boys with a buried penis are often told that they will grow out of it, and many cases will improve, but some will never have a penis that looks as long or works as well as it might. A boy with a deeply buried penis may be ridiculed by other boys.

His doctor also said that the fat pocket will push the foreskin over the head of the penis.  Just make sure thar you push back the foreskin.  He will grow out of it when he loses his baby fat.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	He's fine, he'll grow out of it.  It is especially important with a circumcised boy with an "innie" that you pull the skin back at each diaper change to keep the skin from reattaching.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Did you ask this question before.. like a few days ago? I remember reading one similar to it and everyone said it was normal that penis was inverted. I was shocked because it never happened to my son and it just doesn't sound like something it should do. My son (also circumcised) has always been lean and not chubby so maybe that is why it has never happened. Some of his foreskin does cover part of the head but it doesn't "disappear". I asked my pediatrician about it and she said a lot of Doctors are now not cutting so much skin off because they are afraid they will cut off too much. I would definitely get a second opinion about it. Even if the second Doctor tells you the same thing, at least you can stop worrying about it.

Children need to be loved unconditionally. Nurtured - fed and protected. Disciplined also, which is not easy sometimes. Be sensible please, after all it's a child's life we are talking about. Remember, not all women want children and there is nothing wrong with that, really. Women who don't have children because they are unsure are the brave ones. So think about this one long and hard.

Do you have any pain in the lower left and right side of your back??|`|iup3ZrS7aa	i had that too! it usually means u have preeclampsia, thats what i had. or it could just be that u need to drink more water, just wait for the test and talk to your doctor|`|yDNv30Okaa	pre eclampsemia<br>  i had it, and had to do the 24 hr wee thing, then i was induced a wk l8r.|`|9QUeZ0nbaa	the protein in your urine could indicate an infection, i have no idea bout the lucocytes tho.<br>  i hope the 24hr collection brings news.<br>  <br>  good luck on the impending birth

Q05rrSX4aa	Spotting on birth control is normal.  If you are not taking it correctly, or have just started it can happen.  <br>  <br>  Sex should be fine, I can't see why it wouldn't but ask your doc to be sure.|`|z93tSvKxaa	Ask your Ob-Gyn.
B7iSU8UYaa	It really depends on the build of the person and the way that they carry the baby. On average, you may be able to conceal the pregnancy until month five. The second baby shows sooner. <br>  <br>  As for clothes, you may need to experiment with what looks best on you. You can try flattering bootcut jeans or black pants worn with a loose dress shirt. Flowing blouses are good, and jackets are great. Avoid tight or tailored clothes.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It depends on the person.  I'm barely showing (18 weeks, 3 days preggers)...people who don't know me well wouldn't know I'm pregnant at all.  I think the only way that you could prolong it at 1st is to wear clothes that are intentionally flowing around the tummy area.  Tunic tops, sun dresses...stuff like that.  I think tops that gather laterally would work pretty good.  I don't think baby doll tops and skinny jeans are a good idea :-P|`|qayCggxMaa	Part of it depends on how big you are to begin with.  If you are petite and skinny, you'll probably show a lot earlier.  I, on the other hand, am the opposite of petite and skinny.  I was pregnant with my 2nd child and mentioned to someone at church that my daughter would have a sibling in a month - they hadn't realized I was pregnant.  Granted, I always wear fairly loose or baggy clothing too.  On average I think most people really start showing around 6 months or so.  Baggy clothes can help hide it for awhile.  By the very end though I don't think there is much you can do to hide it - the last few weeks of both my pregnancies my stomach just ballooned outward and became very obvious.|`|W1p6LetFaa	I was obviously showing by 16 weeks, but I was showing pretty early (plus I was trying to dress to show off my bump).  Most women do not start showing that early.  If you want to hide it, wear a lot of sweatshirts or baggy tshirts.  Or since it will be warm soon, it will be harder to hide.  Buy some of those shirts with the empire waistline, which means that it's tight by your boobs but then just hangs loosely over your belly.|`|MqFeJiukaa	A few months.  Your belly is not the only thing you need to worry about hiding.  When a women is pregnant her boobs get bigger, when she bends down to lift something she struggles to get back up (for me before I even looked pregnant) her face gets rounder, ect.  Hiding it will only make matter worse so to me that is really silly.|`|nluNSDI4aa	Well normally a women doesn't start showing until around the 5th month of pregnancy. But i have heard maternity clothes work wonders. Pray all is well tho::)|`|z93tSvKxaa	Why are you trying to hide it?  Are you underage or sleeping with someone else's husband?  What gives?|`|ZUepTX57aa	It depends on your body and the season you're pregnant in.  I knew a girl that hid the entire pregnancy and her family only knew when she told them a week before she had the baby.  It was winter time and she was able to wear sweatpants and sweatshirts every day to cover it up.  If you're smaller to begin with, you may not even start showing until month 6, which is a little late to start showing, and if the bump doesn't grow all that much, you could probably easily hide it.  But again, it depends on body type and seasonal timing.|`|71666e2ead7e63aae9cf35bc3d3a361daa	there is no right answer to that questions. some people don't show for five months, some show at three. if you are a plus sized woman i's easier to hide. you can, with the right clothes, make it look like you've just put on weight. for a slender woman it's much more difficult to disguise.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	I was able to wear my regular clothes until i was 5 months pregnant.  If you want to hide the pregnancy, just wear baggy clothes.  Make sure you get regular pre-natal checkups from a doctor....don't avoid the doctor in an effort to hide the pregnancy.  Good luck.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Unless I told you no one knew I was pregnant until 6 1/2 months pregnant. My picture is at 8 months. I never got really big.<br>  <br>  When I wear pullover sweat shirts I look about 5 months pregnant.<br>  <br>  You can't hide it forever, but for a while.|`|on3CVSgWaa	depends on your pre-preg size and weight...<br>  <br>  My first preg I was thin and had no way to hide after 15-16 weeks...by my 4th daughter I was pretty overweight, and was still wearing my regular jeans at 26-27 weeks...|`|2oHcYHFyaa	it depends on the person. i have had friends who hid their whole pregnancy. there are also girls that get really big and cant really hide it. so goodluck and see what kind of belly your going to have.|`|RFKuxqPbaa	you will probably be hidden until the beginning of the third trimester or the end of the second (5-6 months)|`|YttvaSQWaa	THE TIME IT TAKES TO SHOW IS NOT THE SAME FOR EVERY WOMAN. THE MORE PETITE YOU ARE THE MORE IT WOULD BE HARDER TO HIDE. THE BIGGER THE PERSON THE EASIER TO HIDE THE BELLY.IN GENERAL I WOULD SAY BETWEEN 3-5 MONTHS. HOWEVER HIDING A PREGNANCY IS NOT RECOMMENDED, PRENATAL CARE IS VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE GIVING UP THE CHILD PRENTAL CARE IS IMPORTANT. IF YOU DONT WANT THE CHILD YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ABORTION. THEY HAVE ABORTIONS THAT YOU CAN DO BY PILL IF YOU ARE NOT THAT FAR ALONG|`|fS9lryRkaa	Well me and my girlfriend are currently 5 months pregnant, still havent told her parents... It would be best to to just tell them sooner, it'll make things easier, we are planning on telling them this weekend. and were scared as hell. Just tell them, please, it'll make things easier and go see a doctor.|`|8vV145Peaa	It depends on your body. I'm 20 weeks and I can hid my belly with no problem. I only look like im 4 months along. but its not that im fat. i was 115 before i got pregnant. <br>  My cousin girlfriend couldn't hid hers at all well she could but only till about 4 months|`|HxWh88soaa	well i made it to three months before i was noticablly showing
vygYFdsSaa	Honestly you need to stop trying to make the perfect scenario and just spit it out. She's 5 months pregnant and she has not seen a doctor, this is very dangerous. She needs medical care ASAP. She should tell her parents herself -- maybe tell her mom first, if they are close. She could also write them a letter if she's scared of their reaction. She just needs to get it over with, obviously its going to be hard, but its urgent now that she tells them as quickly as she can.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Go to her parent's house and tell him!  Be a man!<br>  <br>  2 kids with different mom's....pathetic.  Get ready to pay double child support.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Well for starters you want them to take you out?  Hmm...you're starting out all wrong.  I think you need to take THEM out to soften the blow.  And you can tell them you want to take them out for a "post-Valentines" dinner.  Their parents...and I'm sure they're just happy that their daughter is doing something nice that they won't question much.  And just the thought...is there a way you could pull off some type of a "commitment" gift to present their daughter...kind of as a reassurance?  Good luck to you two.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Wow.<br>  <br>  5 months pregnant and she has not been to a doctor yet? Thats completely irresponsible, prenatal care is extremely important.<br>  <br>  You guys have to tell them, just come out with it. I agree that it should be in public, that can lessen the chance of overreaction and will give them a bit of time to calm down before going home.<br>  <br>  You really need to tell them because they are going notice her belly soon.|`|MqFeJiukaa	Well since you are an adult so to speak now why don't you take her parents out for dinner?  That is the least you could do is come up with 50 bucks for a decent meal.  <br>  You need to call her and make a plan to go over tonight and sit down and tell them.  Esp since its a weekend and it will have time to settle before work on Mon.|`|hswTS1jVaa	You have no choice but to just come out and say it.<br>  <br>  Tell them you want to go out to dinner if that's what you want to do. Tell them to get to know the boyfriend/girlfriend better.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	It would be very unfair to tell them in a public place. And it will only delay the inevitable -- you can't keep them in public forever. They are going to react sooner or later.<br>  <br>  The thing to do is to sit them down TONIGHT and tell them, "We're facing a challenge, and we need your guidance and support. We know we have to face this responsibility, and we know we're too young, so we really need your help."<br>  <br>  They'll figure it out by the time you get to the word "responsibility."<br>  <br>  Also, you need to learn to keep your pants zipped. Two children just four months apart from two different girls at your age...time to grow up.|`|KdqaGnlwaa	Wait wait wait.. you want HER parents to take ya'll out to dinner so you can break the news??? Why don't YOU grow some b@lls, go to her parents house and break the news to them together. Be a grown man! You are about to be a father, its about time you start taking responsibility and act like an adult. You don't need to be taken out to dinner, if you are scared of her parents, you should have been more careful. Sorry bud, if the truth hurts you, that means its TRUE.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I think telling them in a public place shows a deep lack of maturity on your part. You need to just tell them, do it tonight. I am a Catholic parent, and if my 16 year old daughter came to me pregnant, my first concern would be for her health, and that of her unborn child. End of story. You really do not know how they will react until you give them the chance. The longer you put this off, the worse it becomes. DO IT NOW....and make certain that she is getting her prenatal vitamins.|`|vdCHmoXkaa	wait two kids on the way lost...<br>  <br>  try telling them at church :]<br>  <br>  and get that girl to the doctors!<br>  <br>  trust me i didnt have my first appointment til i was almost 5 months<br>  they still hate me!<br>  be as responsible as you can as well!|`|nluNSDI4aa	The same way you would tell ANY parent. Pray all is well tho:)|`|3lcEdc6xaa	Well i commend you for accepting your responsabilty and heres the best advice i can give with alternatives aswell. 1. alternative is write a letter.. to one parent.. the one youre closest to... start the letter with reminding ur parent how much you love them and never want to dissapoint them and how their opinion matters. and how you hope they can always remain proud of you because youre human and youre gonna make mistakes along the way. also if their religious grab a quote from the bible that states that all sins are forgiven.. for we are all sinners.. (seems like whatever we do is a sin)..btw..im catholic raised traditionally so im putting myself inur shoes.. be sure in the end to say how afraid you are in ur situation and grafually confess the message across the end of the letter..its like youre preparing the persons mind for news that may seem bad at first but face it in the end its a blessing..not many people can concieve and you guys can so youre dealing with this gift...you can give the letter to one parent especially the one ur closests to bc their gonna tell the other parent.. have both couples do this intheir own homes.. u can either tell ur parent to read it infront of you and then theyll discuss it with you then and there..or if their temper is bad you shld jus stay away for the day let them cool off.. but jus stay calm and firm with who you are because when you believe in your self and your decision its hard to break that mold.. i had two abortions before and im not ashamed to admit it as i said before im traditionally rasied in a single parent home i cnt do that to my mom..even though shed kill me either way but still have to deal w it..be prepared to b told ud have to get married..possibly 2. another alternative... for the women who is pregnant play the victm card..it sounds very ignorant but when vulnerable parents cave in.. so as i said play victm go to the parent ur closests too and appear crying.. crying because ur not feeling well and ur afraid of the possibilities..ull eventually end up being escorted to the doc or something and the doc will deliver the news.. u can be jus as surprised as they shld be and cry even more and apologize and say ur keeping it.. uve been blessed.. and it can be overwhelming these scenarios but play them out the way ur most comfotable theyre just ideas.. Jus know that youre human and yes ur yng but i find that when things are kept taboo in a home children and people are more likely to become curious and figure it out on their own rather than have their knowledge given at home.. you guys will be okay bc i believe in life god doesnt put things in our path we cant handle.. luckily we sometimes have options.. may all be well good luck..feel free to email me if you want any advice or anything else :).. "only god can judge me..so dnt think im judging you".."we are all only human"|`|3w7VztEWaa	I'm 16 and I waited four months until I told my parents..I regret it so much. I wrote mine an email and saved it an im drafts than I went to my friends house for the week who lives in a different town and I sent it while I was there..they didn't see me for three extra days and they were totally cooled off by then.<br>  <br>  I say if you go out to dinner you guys should pay for them..just tell them you want all four of you to go out and just have some quality time together. there doesn't have to be a reason. but like i said be sure you pay..

3F8f1SoQaa	he will be fine. give him pain relief as needed. keep the cast elevated. when my (then) 19 month old broke his thigh we were advised to give him a bean bag chair to sit in  and be comfy. within about a week he was ready to play on the floor with matchbox cars and stuff like that. we made sure to put a towel over his leg while he ate to keep the cast clean. for bathing I went to wal-mart and got no-rinse body wash towellettes to use instead of sponge bathing him..<br>  <br>  e-mail me if you have any specific questions.|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	Did the doctor prescribe or give any recommendations for pain medicine?

This will help blood flow and help youir furniture from getting too damaged from the roughness of the cast. Another thing that works is an ace bandage to wrap and that'll help minimize damage as well. As far as activities go he needs the seditary ones. So reading coloring playing games. (I'm going to get a few thumbs down for this) But for a week maybe let him watch a few more tv programs than normal. He might even sleep a little more than usual just because he's trying to heal. That would be something to encourage as it does help healing. Maybe even find something special for him to try to do everyday that maybe is something rare. Good Luck Hope he heals fast.
E6T9DPT9aa	It can take years for the pill to get out of your system fully.<br>  If you had unprotected sex, then there is a chance you could be pregnant.<br>  It could be that your period is coming!<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	uhh.. duh? seriously jus take a test and get ur man to strap it up next time... dumb|`|cljrVTpiaa	There is a chance however  i believe that your body is just regulating itself again
IOp3knBjaa	Yes, your gf can and might be pregnant. Obviously she is late for her period right? Even though she may be irregular I would get an at home test or go to a doctor and have a test done. Also, if her doctor thinks she has something that requires medicine its very important that she find out for sure weither or not she is pregnant because there are tons of medicines you cannot take while pregnant!! Just a little more info. Sperm can live inside the body for up to 7 days and a womans most fertile time tends to be 14 days after the first day of her last period. Not the same for every woman, but on average. I would not wait on testing, do it asap!

If it comes out positive, you can go schedule an appt. with a doctor or even planned parenthood based on your guys age and ask for a pregnancy test done by a physician. From then on you will know for sure!<br>  <br>  So best thing to do ... is wait and see! It's nerve racking to wait, but at least you and your girlfriend know for sure! Good Luck!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	She needs to take a test with her first morning urine (so if you don't get the test until tomorrow, she can take it the day after).  If it's positive, she's pregnant.  If it's negative, she'll need to test again in a few days.  <br>  <br>  She needs to see the doctor SOON for either prenatal care or birth control.  In the meantime, both of you need to keep your pants zipped.  If she isn't pregnant now, you don't want her to be.
XgxW3as5aa	of course its possible!! better to finish now then to stop and continue later on. some schools, not sure about yours will give you free dorm the only issue is babysitter. which depending on your schedule and a friends maybe you dont have to pay for a babysitter. luckily im a cummuter so i stay at home. me and my mom made arrangements that she would babysit when i have classes. im 27weeks and in my first year of college. so i haven't exactly experienced the whole 9 yards but its one of those things that you have to do. think about it the best thing for your baby is to finish school. you have plenty of time to get things straighten together. plus im a single soon to be mommy too so right now you just have to make sure that the lonely feeling dont effect your school work. it will all work out =) best wishes and congrats!!|`|QQhe3NmHaa	Go to your Citizens advice bureau  to see what help is available.<br>  <br>  You can get help towards childcare, and also maybe ask to do your work from home whe the baby is young ?<br>  <br>  Look on the internet for advice,don't go back to your partner because you are desperate, and don't rush in to another relationship !<br>  <br>  I think you can get benefits, or tax credits if you work part time.|`|F4XaPnXHaa	Hi, im a single mum and a first year undergraduate student studying a BSc honours degree in Psychology.

8sJQP3Y4aa	Your chances are still good for ivf/icsi with a low sperm count.  The icsi pretty much does the work for the sperm.  It's leading the horse to the water, so to speak.  As long as he has some sperm for the doctors to work with then you'll be good to go.  My fiance and I will be doing the same thing next month.  Good luck to you and stay confident!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	My husband and I have been trying for a long time. Due to my endometriosis, it's making it so hard to get pregnant. I was on clomid for 5 months, didn't work. I just called my Fertility Doctor back today and told him the clomid isn't working for me so I want to try something else, and not use the last prescription that I have for clomid. My Doc agreed. He put in an order for my husband to get a sperm check done, he told me that even if my husbands count is low, or doesn't have good mobility, that artificial insemination would still work, because it puts the sperm right through the cervix. <br>  <br>  I was also told that there is a drug called "proxeed, and proxeed plus. It's not to pricy, but it helps increase mens sperm count and helps the little guys travel better. I'm looking into getting that for my husband when we go to do the AFI.|`|hqogf9oGaa	Hey - yes you still have a good chance.  <br>  <br>  With IVF the sperm is prepared and then introduced to the same environment as the eggs and fertilisation is allowed to happen itself.  The preparation of the sperm means that the "best" sperm are put in with the eggs.<br>  <br>  With ICSI, the sperm is injected into the individal egg (this is the image that most people associate with IVF but it's just a media myth that they do this with IVF) so the job is basically done for the sperm and it's just a case of waiting to see if the embryos develop.<br>  <br>  I am guessing that since you say it's your first cycle of IVF/ICSI that the clinic have decided to wait until egg collection day when they receive the sperm sample to decide which procedure will suit best so try not to worry too much and rest assured that they will choose the one that will give you the best chance of success.<br>  <br>  Not sure if you will already of heard of this site:-<br>  <br>  www.fertilityfriends.co.uk<br>  <br>  but it is really good and the ladies are all very friendly, supportive, understanding and all too happy to answer questions you may have so it may be worth checking it out.  You would probably no doubt meet someone in a similar situation to you.<br>  <br>  Wishing you all the luck in the world with your treatment and sending heaps of babydust your way.<br>  <br>  Indigo<br>  <br>  xxx|`|fCSx1T6Aaa	Hi,<br>  Ive been were you are now. My partner had a extremely low sperm count banked after he was diagnosed with cancer. The cancer had already began to attack prior to being collected. BUT it had some motile sperm. We've had two rounds of ICSI the later being successful. As long as there is one motile sperm your chances are just as good as with 50 as with icsi they take one sperm and one egg, that's all it takes. The chances of success do increase if you are fit and healthy yourself. I took pregnacare and had reflexology on the 2nd course which i attributed to helping me, but everyone is different. I would like to point out im a size 16, and not particually healthy, but have no fertility problems myself. Wishing you all the luck in the world.....|`|m001xWWKaa	My husband and I have been trying to conceive via IVF/ICSI as well. My husband also has a VERY low sperm count with abnormal looking sperm. The only difference between me and you is that I don't ovulate on my own, but have great success with clomid. <br>  We worked with one doctor for the first one and I had 21 eggs retrieved with 13 being fertilized.  I ended up with hyperstim so the live transfer had to be canceled, but we ended up being able to freeze 4 blasts.  When we went through FET (on two separate cycles) all of them made it through the thawing process. Unfortunately they liked it better in the dish and not so much in my uterus:(  <br>  We moved on to another doctor and I again had 20 eggs retrieved and this time 16 fertilized. We just had our transfer of 2 blasts yesterday and are in our 2ww.  As of yesterday they were able to freeze 2 blasts and hopefully would be able to freeze more today!  Hopefully we won't need them until our next child!!<br>  <br>  So long story short....we had great success with the sperm they were able to get from my husband..we are just hoping my body will do what it needs to do! <br>  <br>  I wish you good luck with everything!|`|wniWxNlEaa	icsi is for men wiv a low sperm count as they are putting the sperm directly into the egg unlike ivf where the sperm are put around the egg so they hav to make there own way into the egg so i'd say you have a better chance with icsi good luck|`|sxx6u7sXaa	They should wash the sperm, and that will raise the count. They fertilize outside the body, so they can choose the best. You still have a good chance.
u94HOVz7aa	you could boil the water then let cool to room temp.  it will still be sterile boiled water. then you have it made ahead of time to use for the bottles without waiting for it to cool for each bottle. if you want to mix with formula you can refridgerate for up to 24hrs (powder) or 48hrs (liquid concentrate) as long as they haven't drank out of the bottle.  one think i do is i use the liquid concentrate so in the morning i boil water then let it cool down for 5-10 min then put it in a thermos to stay warm and its ready to mix with the cold refridgerated concentrate and makes the perfect temp bottles.  that way i am not having to boil water everytime or heat a bottle everytime.  just mix and go with a nice warm bottle no waiting.   good luck and congratulations!|`|iRXraQWyaa	For our three children, and we have never had any problems, we have sterilised the bottle and boiled the water, and after that have kept it like that for up to 24 hours at normal temperature, adding milk powder as and when feeds are needed.  Once the milk as been added I understand it should be used with three hours.|`|HaITV5Chaa	the reason the water is boiled is because the powder isn't sterile so adding the powder to cooled boiled water isn't killing the bacteria in the formula. my midwife told me to use the ready to use cartons for the night feed and make them up as and when during the day. Having said this i know of people that use cooled boiled water and it hasn't done there bubbas any harm i guess its down to the individuals.<br>  <br>  I also want to add if you want to cool a bottle just put it in a jug under a cold running tap.|`|TLjNUJHLaa	What I do is pour room temperature nursery water in the bottles and when my baby is hungry I just have to mix in the formula. I tried the warming up bottles but I forgot the bottle was warming and it was to hot.|`|TZ4mbFh3aa	I use nursery water, and have a bottle warmer ($15 @ Target) and it heats it to a perfect temp every time!|`|J4YNRrsuaa	of corse you do that. That wont hurt anything
xPTUzTBcaa	No, no, don't listen to them! ^^^<br>  <br>  Your supposed to sterlize bottles/teats until you baby is about 12 mnths, when their immune system is strong enough to fight any harmfull bacteria. reason for doing the bottles/teats/dummies and not the bowls/spoons is because there's more nooks&crannies (sp?) for bacteria to grow in. It could make your baby ill if you don't clean stuff properly.|`|1S7uXsInaa	I was told by my ped. that you only need to sterilize when you purchase new bottles/nipple before their 1st use.  The rest of the time is not necessary.  After you sterilize you just put the bottles in the cabinet or where ever where they are exposed to the elements around them, not in a seal tight germ free container.  Kind of unnecessary if you ask me.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I only sterilized bottles after they came out of the package.  After that I just washed with hot water and dish soap. <br>  <br>  Did it that way since my son was a newborn.|`|iBWcAw4Oaa	You sterilise bottles up untill they are 1, as the stomach is small and has too be protected up untill then.|`|Dx2ayijwaa	I use the dishwasher and wash my son's bowls ect. the same as I would wash my dishes.

Advice in other countries differs.<br>  <br>  According to the NHS website I've linked it's because bottles and teats have lots of hard to reach areas where milk can get trapped.<br>  <br>  *** I love that I got thumbs down even with a link to the UK national health service website.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	i am on my 3rd baby & she too is 4mths.  i have not sterlized a thing for her.  she is happy & healthy, she is already 15lbs!  i think it is a personal preference.  if you would like to stop just make sure you wash them good & then also make sure all the soap is rinsed off.
UYnAASPJaa	you never mentioned his age not that it matters a lot but my son was the same way and after some medical advise we put him on a low dose of mood stabilizer and it worked. we have a strict behavior chart in place with money ( allowance) as the reward when very young we use chuck e cheese tokens. our day is very planed too. <br>  certain time for cleaning homework and play all 3 everyday but sundays which is his free day if he has done his work all week. we limit his screen time and that made the biggest difference. trust your gut if you think he needs meds then talk to his doc. and if someone dosent support you don't tell them. this is your son's life and you are in charge of it. do it it is hard but put it in writing this is how things are going to be and most importantly stick to it.!!!! Good luck|`|chfILbonaa	Well maybe he wants attention or something I used to be like that nothing worked it ot to the point where i lost every privelege i had and got spaked and really i didnt care anymore maybe he wants a better relationship with his parents or something<br>  <br>      also if you ignore him he will know that being angry wont get our attention for a few days dont say anythign and wehn he does get mad ignore him and dont do anything he might just stop|`|euN3ct9oaa	Bribe him with money! Keep it strict and don't be pushed around. If that doesn't help, you need to get some professional help as soon as possible.

oHNrktxTaa	It sounds like you have a great chance that you very well might be!<br>  Just keep in mind to prepare yourself, just in case, that pregnancy & premenstrual symptoms are very similar to eachother. <br>  <br>  I had many of the same symptoms as well, took a HPT, & got a BFN:( But, everyone is different. <br>  That is good that you had a blood test done:) The HPT may not have picked up on your HCG levels yet, if you are pregnant.

1VOsRV8Maa	I have an 8 month old who JUST got over a cough. He had VERY bad phlegm and I used his humidifier. I have a couple of good friends (One is a l&d nurse, and one is an anesthetist, but BOTH used to be ER nurses.) Anyhow, they told me to rub a little bit of vick's vaporub on the bottom of his feet and put socks on him. Not too much, though, cause it can be ingested through the skin. But on the feet will do the same as on his chest without the worry of him rubbing it by or in his eyes. Also, if he seems cranky or develops a fever, give him a little bit of infant tylenol. Most likely he'll just have to wait it out, as is the case with most colds. Good luck! hope this helped a little!|`|gPg7qYGIaa	it normal baby's get coughs my 6 month old has one it will go away in a few days stop panicking if there was something wronge he have a temperture or rash if he still has it in a few days go to dr|`|ZZhEmJNmaa	Just keep a close eye on him.

Some children are easier than others, this I know.  You only have one shot at raising your child from infancy, if I had it to do over, I think I would have worked just part-time and learned how to get by on less.  <br>  <br>  If you working puts enough stress on you, think of how it effects both your family and your job.  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you and the hubby need to have a sit down talk about your stress and broken heart.  Good luck|`|SRsFkNBBaa	well the first questions is how flexibile is your job? would they be willing to negotiate a new schedule for you? more and more nowadays, companies are getting better about the value of family. see if there is a way that you can squeez your hours, and mabey work 4 10 hour days, instead of 5 8 hour days. that gives you 3 days off to regroup and speand quality time with your baby. it is completely up to you whether you want to stay home or not. i do understand what you mean, when you get an offer like the one it sounds like you have, be grateful and keep it!! but i know like you do it has its costs! that is why i suggest to try and have your cake, and eat it too! you would have 4 longer days-but more full days off, and 1 extra full day off,. and you can work it howver you want, or however they are willing to let you. see if they can offer you different scheduled times. find out what you rights are at your comp[any, and paid leave time. good luck and i hope you figure it out. it is hard, i do it everyday. my  hubby is laid off so i really don't have a choice. i have the luxury of taking my son to work everyday with me.|`|7oPZbdnEaa	Do what you feel it right.  Your hours for working sound great no many people get off before 5. If can stay at home i would, at least just for the 1 st year.  But, it the economy the way it is who know how long you and your husband well have your job.  The had floppily thing is normal, they just don't have the strength to hold their own head up yet, but he will in time.

I went back to work when he was 12 weeks old.  I leave for work at 6, drop him off at 630, and I don't pick him up until 5-5:30 (I have about an hour and half commute from home to work).  I hardly ever get to see him, but as a single parent I have to work.  I have no choice. <br>  <br>  You are very lucky that you have the option to stay home.  Most single moms don't have that luxury.|`|Tv7O1I0Taa	I think you need to sit down with your husband and go over the finances.  If you can live on his salary then I think you should explore staying home with your son or maybe go part-time.  I am sure that your employer has been in this situation before with other moms.  I gave up my career to become a stay at home mom 18 yrs ago.  It hasn't always been easy, the money was tight in the beginning and no social interaction for me.  But as I sit here today, I truly feel it was the best thing that I have ever done.  We have two wonderful children and we are a very close family.  I have a great relationship with my kids and I could not be prouder of them.  I understand what you are going through.  I did the exact same thing with our oldest until I just could not take it any more.  I wish you the very best.|`|UYnAASPJaa	i had to make this choice to and let me tell you it does get easier but then when there is another one thats more daycare expeensnce and let me tell you the one thing that really changed my mind and brought me back home was the fact that i felt someone else was raising my baby ( not necessarliy the way i would). this is a personal choice only you and your hubby can make. but it was easy for me to give up the income and become a full time mom my job now is (besides mommy) is to make the money stretch cut coupons, find sells, work out deals clean office for karate classes. he makes the money but i make it go further. there are lots of groups to help you learn to do that.|`|b7k0Ahwyaa	My little one is 3 months old.  I had the same dilemma less than a week ago.  I was on leave and had to make the decision to return to work or stay at home with my little one.  I stressed about it every night even shed many of tears leading up to my return from work.  With the economy the way it is I hated to leave a GREAT job.  And there is no such thing as job security anymore so I worried about my husbands job too.  My husband also works and we are comfortable with one income (just more comfortable with two).  <br>  <br>  We finally made the decision for me to stay at home.  I put my career on hold (I think employers can respect that) and am now staying at home with my little one.  As for job security, i can't worry about what i don't know will happen.  The future is never guaranteed but i know I want to spend the time i have with my little girl.  I can't have someone else raise her.  <br>  <br>  Look into your heart and make the decision that is right for you and your husband.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!
B7iSU8UYaa	Any time you have unprotected sex, there is a chance of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  You can take a pregnancy test 14 days after intercourse for an accurate result. I prefer the digital kind, since I think they are more accurate and easier to read. If you don't have your period a week after that, take another test. Good luck!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	It's possible to get pregnant anytime during your cycle.  Test tomorrow.|`|gDvqoxZVaa	I waited until my period was five days late, and it came out positiive. so I'm sure u will b ready for one now, but for best results wait a couple of days.<br>  <br>  EDD 10/8/09|`|plI0WOrUaa	Having unprotected sex a week before your period is prime ovulation time.  Its very possible.  You can test today if you want, but probably more accurate in the morning with your first urine of the day.  You can get a pregnancy test that will allow you to test 5 days before your period.  Its not always 100% effective, but you can try.  It worked for me.  Good luck|`|dR2bqUixaa	The best time to try to get pregnant is 1 or 2 weeks before your period. So you could, possibly, be pregnant.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	It's possible.  Take a test tomorrow with your first morning urine.|`|y38cvIn9aa	You can take a test any day now. Tomorrow would be better, but today should be fine. Tomorrow morning would be the best because you have higher HcG levels in the morning. It is possible to get pregnant, just not always likely. It's usually right in between periods when you ovulate.

Some employers are looking to hire work from home employees to keep overhead jobs down, so keep an eye in your local classifieds. <br>  <br>  Also, look into becoming a virtual assistant.  It's pretty much being an administrative assistant, but you work from home.

imIiuaAAaa	I had something similar that spanned over two days and wasn't heavy at all...and I'm 16 weeks pregnant lol. It very well could be implantation bleeding. Test in a few weeks to be be sure =]|`|5DfSfyWfaa	Implantation bleeding was very light, like a couple dots. No where near enough to require pads. That's what prompted a pregnancy test for me.|`|uxmqgmCCaa	do a test thats the only way youll know.|`|vygYFdsSaa	It's really hard to say. You should just take a pregnancy test to be sure. Good luck, I hope you're successful :)|`|y38cvIn9aa	When was your last period? Were you "late" for this month? Implantation bleeds can cause slight cramps, and minimal bleeding. If you're still unsure, take a pregnancy test. It's really the only way to know for sure.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That sounds like your period - or break through bleeding, implantation bleeding is really some color and you wouldn't need to use any pads.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	It could be your period, but it wasn't implantation bleeding.  Implantation bleeding is very light and doesn't last longer than 24 hours.

Put simple things in it that will be 'new' to her.  Such as a couple of children's books, large stickers and blank paper (to make a 'card' for mommy and daddy), brightly colored scarves and hats for dress up.  Tell her you brought some of 'your' toys to share with her.  After awhile ask her to show you her toys.  She will love showing off her things.  Just focus on her and be happy and upbeat.|`|R64YLe72aa	Let her wach tv and draw aand teachher how to play pat a cake then take some stuffed animals and put on a "play"|`|dShnJ20raa	Make play doh, watch a kiddie movie, color, bubbles, take her outside if it is early enough.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Do you know how to bake? You could bake something simple like muffins or cookies and have her mix or decorate the cookies/muffins/cupcakes. To make things easier you could pick up some mix at the grocery store.<br>  <br>  Arts and Crats: You can buy some neat things at the dollar store.  Play Doh<br>  <br>  Coloring: Print out some coloring sheets (superheros, barbie, disney ect..)<br>  <br>  Watch Movies: Bring/rent a mmovie that they havent seen or that they love and eat popcorn!<br>  <br>  Play outside/Go for a walk/Go to the Park<br>  <br>  BARBIES|`|pzlxRbIOaa	Coloring books.

What do you think?<br>  <br>  Also for your character have you tried sticking with the simple names and combining them to make whole new ones? Try that. For example - Layla and Rose, Layla-Rose. I know it's a double name but you try mixing and matching some and you might find that works with some of the cool names you get on the link above.

Oyktk3rHaa	no that does not make since your friend or that someone should go to a diffrent doctor|`|ckgiPMm4aa	Your both miss calculating your due dates or how far you are then.<br>  If someone is due on May 30th, then today they are 25+6.<br>  <br>  Go to baby-gaga.com<br>  go to tickers,<br>  type in your due date and it'll tell you how far you really are.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	it looks like they are only two weeks off- they may be counting their weeks by the date of conception instead of the first day of the last period- or 38 weeks is considered full term so she may just be anxious to see the little one and that helps to make it seem like the time has gone  by quicker|`|e4ec8a26064d1b408b4d493f2b6d5d8baa	She would be 38 weeks then not the 40.  Your counting 40 weeks and she is counting 38 weeks which is considered full term.|`|bx6OKLIbaa	it could be true b/c if ultrasound shows the exact size of baby not fronm the periods date.|`|on3CVSgWaa	with that due date...she would be 25w6d right now...I think she forgot how to add, or is making something up|`|PvnnWE1Baa	My sis n law is 25 wks. & she's due on May 25th. So maybe you should check with your Dr.|`|zwctZ812aa	one of you may be counting from when you actually got pregnant rather than your LMP.  Or her doctor could have changed her due date based on the ultrasound and she didn't realize that changed the amount of weeks she was.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	maybe they are going by an original due date given or the last day of their period instead of the due date. Doc's will switch stuff up on you. Or maybe they are just mistaken, just ask them about it.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i am 29 weeks and due may 9th so it does sound a bit early, are they planning a c section? if so they would be delivering at 39 weeks, which may be more correct, but still that doesnt make a lot of sense, she probably just wanted the baby to come before june because it feels too far away, i wouldnt worry about it the baby isnt going to come until its ready anyway.  did you mention it to her that your due later but are farther along? see what she says.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	This site says that she is actually 26 weeks pregnant tomarrow.|`|55IMnlcwaa	I am 24 weeks today and am due June 12th.

zSABr7praa	I love it.  I fell in love with is after watching "Tristan and Isolde".  Go figure, I love Isolde, too.  My husband said "absolutely not".. he's a marine and tends to be a little closed minded!  He thinks it sounds feminine.  I would pair it with a really strong middle name.  Tristan Michael.  Tristan Thomas.  Tristan Joseph (oooh you could call him TJ!).<br>  <br>  <br>  Everyone seems to be forgetting!  Giving a boy a "SISSY" name, will only make him tougher than the other little boys because he will be so used to defending himself!|`|ZX2so3twaa	i think it sounds a little feminine.|`|dPULl5hjaa	No - it's a sissy boy name|`|cErLq7f3aa	yes. it reminds me of chad michael murray in gilmore girls honestly.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	I like it.  It's a romantic name, from Tristan and Isolda, very British.  I knew a guy once named Tristram who said he was supposed to be Tristan and his mother couldn't quite remember the name from the story and that's what she gave the hospital.  It had already stuck by the time she figured it out and it occurred to her to amend the birth certificate.|`|isZ8eb98aa	I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the name Tristan! lol. I have since, like forver, and it's just very strong and gorgeous to me. It reminds of Tristan and Iseult.....and for some reason a little baby boy with blonde curly hair :)<br>  <br>  -Tila|`|qXq0nmBzaa	I've adored that name ever since I read James Herriot's books (collectively known as "All Creatures Great and Small").|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Honestly I hate it!  A family member of mine who is in his early 20's and named Tristan.  He hates it!  He has always been called Kristen and teased for having a girl name.  I agree with the others.  It is a sissy name|`|Qp79sBF7aa	I love it because of the story of Tristan and Isolde, but also I just like the name!  It comes from "triste" which means sad, but I still like the name.  Name of my future son!|`|6yD5k9Azaa	one of my favorite boy names is Tristan James :D<br>  <br>  i think it sounds like a very smart artistic kid|`|PuQyYMM8aa	Sorry i don't. I think it sounds like a girls name.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Yes. My friend's 2 year old son is named Tristen.|`|nggeyCseaa	omg yes,<br>  i love that name coz i no this little boy bout 10 years old and he is adorable!!!<br>  Tristan is one of the cutest boys ever and so sweet and you just don't expect that coz his family is sooo...<br>  well the rest of the family are either bullies or just not that nice.<br>  therefore in my opinion i LOVE this name|`|x84MEAv5aa	Yes! I love that name!!! <br>  I knew a guy in high school with that name. <br>  He was on the football team. Smart, cute... Always nice to everyone! <br>  <br>  I think that name carries this type of personality... EVERY guy my friends know, are in football, and the same! lol|`|zhq5sW4laa	thats one of my favorite names in the entire workd. Its not too very common and its cool.

I'd be lucky if I were your son!<br>  I've always love Tristan... and Molly sounds kind of cute next (for a girl) to it though I don't really like it.|`|YG7Prmoyaa	Love the name Tristan.<br>  I think its really pretty and no its not a sissy name.<br>  You can't really make fun of the name,<br>  I really like it!<br>  Good choice!(:|`|tw1uePBbaa	i agree, i think it is a little too feminine|`|MUp3wMThaa	Love that name!!|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	not really, it sounds kind of sissy to me.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I do But I like the spelling Tristen better... :)|`|bIaywrBCaa	I do! I have a grandson named Tristan and I fell in love with the name. Had never heard of it prior, but I think it is a great name.
1S7uXsInaa	My son just got over the flu.  He too is usually very talkative and a busy body, but it wore him out!!!  All he wanted to do was snuggle on the couch with me.  If you are concerned, call the Dr. and speak with a nurse about it and follow their suggestions.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	She probably doesn't feel well.  <br>  <br>  Just keep her comfortable,  take her in a steamy bathroom, perhaps set up a humidfier in her room, giving a bath can help clear the nose and be soothing. <br>  Snuggle and give lots of hugs.  Be sure to offer plenty of fluids.  If she begins to run a fever reduce with tylenol if needed.  If she begins to run a high grade fever then bring her in. <br>  Otherwise just let the bug run its course.  Hope she feels better soon.<br>  <br>  Ethels right though, if she seems very lethargic and limp or doesn't do anything, then take her in.  <br>  If she is just a little lazy and not feeling well and just wants to chill, then I wouldn't worry.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That is a worrisome symptom, it's one thing when they are sick - but something else entirely when they are lethargic when they previously were busy babies.   Call the doc and take her in.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	I have brought my baby (9mo) in for 3 colds and they always tell me the same thing:  if he is lethargic, or doesnt act like himself, bring him in or call us back!  Call them!  Talk to the nurses!!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Put some Vaporub on her feet.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If she's lethargic or your gut tells you something is wrong go to a doctor.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/t081000.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/t081000...</a><br>  WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR GENERAL SIGNS THAT A COLD SHOULD BE EVALUATED BY A DOCTOR<br>  <br>  If your child doesn't really fit into any of the four above complications and you still aren't sure if he should see the doctor, here are 6 signs to watch for:<br>  <br>  1. Temperature and length of fever. Fever greater than 103 for more than 3 days, or fever greater than 101 for more than 5 days. Remember, it is normal for a cold virus to cause fever through 5 days. However, if your child keeps getting fevers more than 103 for more than 3 days, it would be prudent to take him to the doctor to be sure there are no bacterial complications yet. It could still just be the cold virus, but it is better not to go more than 3 days with such a high fever without seeing a doctor. See fevers for a detailed discussion on evaluation and treatment.<br>  <br>  2. Unusual lethargy and irritability. Especially in infants. Lethargy means more than just not wanting to run around and play. It means your child can't make eye contact or is unable to focus on you or doesn't respond to your voice. She simply lies on your lap limp and lifeless with her eyes barely open.<br>  <br>  3. Ear infections. Your child has a history of frequent ear infections.<br>  <br>  4. Moderate to severe ear pain. Remember, infants and young children may tug at their ears simply due to ear congestion, not infection. See ear pain for info on how to treat ear pain overnight.<br>  <br>  5. Overall acting sick. If you have a gut feeling that you child is unusually sick, take him to the doctor.<br>  <br>  6. Wheezing. This does not mean the junky, rattling sound of chest or nasal congestion. Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound, when your child takes a breath. If your child is a "happy wheezer" then do not worry. If your child is struggling to breathe, then seek medical attention.<br>  URGENT SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EVALUATION<br>  <br>  You should seek medical attention if:<br>  <br>      * After hours, your child has one of the four complications of a cold (ear infection, sinus infection, pneumonia, bacterial bronchitis) with a fever for more than 5 days over 101 degrees. Your doctor may call in an antibiotic and check your child during regular office hours, or he/she may want your child evaluated in a clinic or ER first.<br>      * Your child has moderate wheezing that is causing some tugging in the front of the neck and ribs, but it doesn't seem to be slowing him down or causing much distress. Your doctor can probably prescribe some medication over the phone to help with the wheezing until the morning. If this happens in the middle of the night, try steaming him before you page the doctor. No need to page the doctor if the wheezing is mild and not troubling your child at all. This can wait to be seen in the office.<br>      * Your child has moderate croup. See Croup for more info on how to treat this and what signs warrant a call to your doctor. <br>  <br>  You should take your child into an ER right away if:<br>  <br>      * Your child has severe wheezing that is causing him significant difficulty breathing.<br>      * Your child has severe croup and is having significant difficulty getting air in.<br>      * Your child's lips or mouth are turning blue due to labored breathing or shortness of breath.<br>      * Your child's breathing is rapid and labored. Count the number of breaths he takes in 30 seconds, multiply it by two, and this gives you his breaths per minute. Go to the ER right away if the breaths are greater than 60 per minute for children under a year, greater than 50 for children 1 through 4, and greater than 40 for children 5 and older. Be aware that fever alone can cause rapid breathing (and a rapid heartbeat). Reduce the fever first and then evaluate your child's breathing.<br>      * Your child seems to have whooping cough and during these severe coughing fits turns blue around the mouth and lips. <br>  <br>  Above all, if you are not certain about the status of your child's breathing, and feel he is in urgent need of an immediate medical decision, then call your doctor.|`|acY817Cwaa	I have a 6month old who has had a few colds so I can share what I know.  Clean out her nose with a nose bulb and you can use saline drops to help loosen the mucus.  A cool mist humidifier also helps.  If she doesn't have a fever and is still eating normally and producing the same amount of wet/dirty diapers, then I wouldn't bother with a doctor's visit.  If she develops a fever or isn't eat and soiling the normal amount of diapers, call your doctor.  They don't give medication for colds or coughs for babies, but can give you something if there is an infection (which would cause a fever).<br>  <br>  My little one always gets a little spacey when she's sick, but usually her nose will clear up in a few days.  I know it's scary, but she should be fine.<br>  <br>  Call the doctor though if you are worried.  They can tell you what to watch for.|`|ZZhEmJNmaa	You're doing all you can for the little thing! Poor babies! My daughter gets a stuff nose a lot with these darn teeth! I use the saline spray, but tip it up so it's drops. Put a couple drops in both nostrils and then use your bulb and suck it out! Sorry if you're already doing this, but that's about it! Tylenol, drops, you're doing good! If you're not doing the drops, make sure if you buy some it doesn't have anything else but the saline in it! Some have other crap in it...<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|J4YNRrsuaa	dont take her to the DR, they cant treat a stuffy nose anyway, its normal for babies to get colds. only if she gets a temp of 102 or higher i would then call them. But there is no reason to right now.|`|fQp92nuoaa	Sorry to hear that. You should call the doctor.|`|6b151cbf6d75d6f7c539a19dfdf3b436aa	go with your gut instincts, humans are the only being on earth that do not trust their instincts the first time
PwhrTNZraa	Normal, it'll just appear from time to time without notice lol.

6yy0jtzDaa	i am still having morning sickness 26 weeks along and i live in the country and always have lol so i think its just your body dealing with hormones|`|xZWP2mqjaa	If you're suggesting environmental pollution is to blame for your morning sickness, I would say you're wrong.<br>  I live within 5 miles of a nuclear reprocessing plant - is anything else blamed as much for pollution? I have not suffered one iota of morning sickness during my 2 pregnancies. My mother didn't suffer any during her 3 pregnancies. Sorry.
EwmHsEoiaa	Most people in the USA have no idea about circumcision.  Including some of the people above.  If you circumcised your boy , would you admit you made a mistake or would you stick your head in the sand?  Circumcised men do not realise that the foreskin is an important part of the penis - neither do a lot of women it seems. <br>  <br>  First I'd recommend you watch this video, called "The circumcison decision":<br>  <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-5395565256830319025&ei=si6cSZCZMYnojgKZmcCUDg&q=nocirc&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?doci...</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a piece of skin.  It has an important function.  It contains many nerves on it's underside. These are stimulated as the foreskin is glided up and down.  Intact men have no need for artificial lube.  They can masturbate freely - and the woman can masturbate him too.  This page shows the function of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  With a circumcised man, the foreskin no longer protects the glans(the head of the penis underneath the foreskin).  This causes the glans to dry out.  The skin of the glans also hardens due to constant brushing against clothes.  A lot of men resent being circumcised for this reason.  You can see the difference here:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  Because the functionality and sensitivity has worsened then sex is a lot worse for both men and women if a man is circumcised(look at the 10 reasons at the top for full explanation):<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  In terms of care - intact boys are easier. There is no care.  The foreskin is attached to the glans underneath at birth.  It separates naturally.  This can happen at anytime - usually from the ages of 0 - 10.  Until then there is no cleaning to do.  You do not pull the foreskin back or try to clean under it.  See here for full details:<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <br>  There is no evidence that circumcision in infancy will give your son an safer life.  <br>  The AAP statement in 1999 recommended against circumcision:<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP-ana.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP-ana.ht...</a><br>  There are claims that circumcision reduces a few things - all are rare - none are serious.  None of it is true.  80% of the world are not circumcised.  This includes places like Britain, France, Germany, Spain all of Europe.  Rates of STI's and Urinary tract infections in these countries are lower than the USA.  All these boys grow up perfectly normal.  there are no men walking around with botched, mutilated penes and they all have better sex lives because they are whole.<br>  <br>  See the myths and the answers to the myths here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelling-myths-about-circumcision/" rel="nofollow">http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelli...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a good blog that lists all the downsides to circumcision:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wreckingboy.livejournal.com/318545.html" rel="nofollow">http://wreckingboy.livejournal.com/31854...</a><br>  <br>  The rate of circumcision has fallen in Australia and Canada to less than 10%.<br>  In 1950 Britain stopped doing it.  less than 1% of British boys are circumcised today. <br>  In the USA, the rates have dropped to 55% - 16 states have stopped medicaid funding.  It is about 25% on the West Coast.  Soon it will be natural to be intact in the USA.  So give your son the choice.  He can get it done later if he wants to(though he won't want to or need to).  He can't put it back on if it is taken off without his consent.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	That's a personal decision. Some people have religious reasons that sway either way. It's very common still where we live (some larger cities are seeing a decrease) and other baby boys born around him were. They also say there may be a decrease in the chance of catching some infections/diseases if they are circumcised. It's all stuff you have to consider.|`|AwoXJAomaa	I did have my son circumcised. He didn't even cry during the procedure. I chose to because he matches his dad and on the advice of my mother. She was a pediatric nurse early in her career and a geriatric nurse at the end and she saw lots of problems with uncircumcised penises in kids and elderly men. <br>  <br>  Boys' penises can get infected and the foreskin can get pulled back and fixing it is very painful. She saw many elderly men with penile cancer because they didn't take good care of the area.<br>  <br>  I just suggest that if you choose not to do it, to educate your son on the correct treatment and hygiene of the penis.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Do most boys have it done where you live?  Then do it.  And if you have a husband or boyfriend who is the father, ask his opinion, he is the father after all.  <br>  <br>  They say it is more hygienic anyway, it's no big deal like some people make it out to be on here, sooo dramatic!  It is very common where I live so I could care less what someone off in some other country thinks of it!|`|8HIVRWQkaa	Hi there, my triplets are being born in one week exactly. <br>  We have 2 girls, one boy, and we ARE planning to have him circumcised. Generations on my side and my husbands side have had it done. <br>  <br>  Not so much for religious reasons, but just to keep the tradition going :)|`|4iXL4C6paa	it's your personal choice I had both of my sons circumcised|`|p2Njf5gBaa	No one can tell what you should do.  <br>  <br>  I recommend doing some research on your own.<br>  Google  Circumcision, pros and cons of circumcision, why to circumcise, why not to circumcise and read read read up on it!  Only at that point should you decide to make a decision.  <br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  TO:  Beautyblitz,  I did not give you a thumbs down for your opinion,  BUT, I was just wondering why you think its okay for people to have it done for religious purposes, but its not okay for personal beliefs and reasoning?    After all, isn't religion a choice, just as circumcise a choice.  Saying you approve of it for religious reasons only is unfair, don't you think?|`|pXSKSS3daa	My son is but that doesn't mean it's best for YOU.<br>  <br>  Research this on your own and decide what's going to work for you and your family. I'm not one to push my beliefs/views on anyone and encourage any person considering this to make a decision based on what they find through research and though of their own.|`|K4zsztkRaa	I would leave my child as he was born. It would be wrong of me to remove a normal, healthy part of his body without his consent. It's my reponsability as a parent to protect him and his body and his choices and I would be abusing my power if I circumcised him.<br>  <br>  I mean what other part of my childs body will I be able to remove without a serious medical reason?<br>  That's right nothing, so why is the foreskin an exception?<br>  It's no cleaner or healthier to be circumcised. It should be illegal for me to touch my child in this way. I see it as sexual abuse.<br>  Circumcision takes away a lot of sensitivity, so it would be wrong of me to take away his sexual pleasure. That's his birth right.<br>  <br>  Infact I can't find one right thing about doing it. I think if I did it then I don't love or respect my child enough to be a good parent. That's just my opinion.<br>  <br>  It's not my body and therefore not my choice.<br>  <br>  I wish I had the choice and I never want my child looking at me like I look at my parents for doing it. I don't want my son to ever feel that betrayed.<br>  <br>  so I'd rather let him keep what rightfully belongs to him.<br>  <br>  a lot of people call it some useless peice of skin, well it might be useless to a few people but to me it's priceless and a wonderful part of my body I wish to have back.<br>  <br>  It's not my place and not my decision to make<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	I'm not a mother, but as a future father, I will never have my son circumcised. More and more people are realizing that it's a pointless procedure. It's purely cosmetic which is why many insurance companies don't cover it.<br>  <br>  And I don't believe any parent has a right to alter the bodies of their children without their permission. If he wants it done later in life, he can get it done himself. Leave the decision to him, it's his body.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I love circumcision debates. I used to spout off all sorts of data and facts that show how pointless it is, but nobody listens anyway. The old traditional myths never die.<br>  <br>  I'm not pro-circ or even anti-circ. I'm PRO-CHOICE. If a man decides he wants to get a circumcision, more power to him! The bottom line is HE decides for HIMSELF. What gives me the right to chop off a piece of my son's body? He has to live his entire life in that body, not me.|`|7kosr9mcaa	No you shouldn't. The dicision is all yours but thats my opinion.<br>  <br>  1. They can screw it up and then your poor baby will either be deformed or have to go through more torture to fix it<br>  2. Babies will disassociate from their body (like a person who is being abused) and can possibly go into shock as a result from the pain. This disassociation can lead to multiple personality disorder or other mental illness.<br>  3.For religious reasons...would you force your religion on another person? NO! So why should being circumsized be your choice? He can decide when he is older.<br>  4."He should look like his dad" BS!!! A young boy is not going to understand. You will just tell him everyone is different thats why he doesn't look like mommy or sissy either. And what teenage boy compares his penis with his fathers?<br>  5."He might be made fun of when he is older" It is your responsibility to teach your child positive body image anyways.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Oh hun. You need to look in to this for yourself. Talk to a pediatrician... urologist... any professional on the matter.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you will NOT get an Un-bias answer to this question on this forum because the opinions are so strong either way.|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	You should do research about this... but in my opinion it's not our decision as their mothers to make - it's our sons'. Since there is no clear medical benefit, it's cosmetic only.<br>  <br>  How would you feel if you were circumcised as a child (female circumcision), and finding out later that they strapped you down, then cut away the most sensitive part of your body without giving you anesthesia and probably killed any chance for you to have a normal, pleasurable sex life. <br>  <br>  Then, you find out your parents did it because they thought it "Looked better," or "were cleaner" or "everyone did it, so we did it too" or, "we wanted you to look like mommy," or "they said we'd prevent you from getting a number of very rare diseases - so rare in fact, that it doesn't even justify circumcision."<br>  <br>  But you're a woman, and you're protected from genital mutilation. But what if you weren't? Would you have been happy with your parents taking away such a big part of yourself from you?<br>  <br>  How are boys' genital integrity and a right to make their own decisions and have control over their own bodies any different than the protection we as women get from the laws? <br>  <br>  Keep your boy the way nature made him. God, or nature, however you want to see it, doesn't make mistakes. If a foreskin was just a useless piece of skin, evolution would've taken care of it by now and all our boys would've been born without it. Still, here we are millions of years later, the human race have changed and evolved since then, but the foreskin is still there. Obviously, there's a reason for it. <br>  <br>  And when your son is old enough to decide for himself, then you can talk about circumcision again.|`|MeYILJeSaa	I didn't have my son circumcised because I felt it was unnecessary.<br>  What you need to do is not ask other people what decision you should make, but do plenty of research and then make a decision based on your own beliefs.<br>  <br>  Just so you know, doing it for hygienic purposes is unnecessary. When left uncircumcised, the penis is a self-cleaning organ with regular bathing. A circumcised penis isn't any cleaner than an uncircumcised penis.|`|Xc02z608aa	I didn't have my son circumcised.  Did you realize that they can screw up such a simple procedure, forever damaging your son?  It does happen.  <br>  <br>  Circumcision started with different religions, then people claimed it was more sanitary.  Now, unless you are religious, there is no reason to do it.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor and make your own decision.  I am personally against it, but don't judge others who decided to have their sons done.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Don't you just love the level of maturity of the people in here.  Thumbs down for expressing my opinion.  Geez Loiuse!<br>  <br>  EDIT: to pumpkins...yeah, I guess it is unfair and so is chopping off your sons foreskin without his consent, don't you think?|`|50iYxQ9Saa	I have no religious reasoning behind my opinion.

OzPehAR7aa	I think you just need a break. Don't be so hard on yourself, you work your you know what off trying to keep him healthy and alive. If he were my son, I would have probably let some anger out a long time ago. He obviously needs some counseling or a visit with the guidance counselor. He can't afford to be skipping school at this age; he must be a freshman or sophomore? Good luck, you sound like a great mom.|`|AA10106002	Try to get him involved with Big Brother, a super organization.|`|FLLVtAdEaa	There is obviously much more to this story. Why is he acting out?<br>  <br>  He's skipping school because he feels he can, he obviously doesn't respect you very much. Maybe you've been to nice and lax, and now your discipline (if you do any) doesn't work or he isn't affected by it.<br>  <br>  Sorry to say, but this was probably a long time coming, and however you raised him had an affect on why he's turning into who he is.|`|qv493CGiaa	Talk to him, tell him how you feel and that his behaviour won't be tolerated any longer. <br>  And hunny, your not a good mum - your a great mum for sticking up with him!

My dad sometimes hits me on the back of the head when he catches me doing something really bad, like when I got caught cheating, which is nowhere near as bad as what he's been doing (not trying to compare...sorry if it sounds that way).<br>  If you haven't already, try talking to him calmly. If he's upset about you hitting him, apologize, because it's harder for teens to talk with their parents when they're mad at them. You need to figure out where this is coming from. Has he done it in the past? If so, and if you know what the cause was in the past, ask him if whatever happened is happening again. Maybe he's having trouble at school, or with friends, and resorts to skipping school and smoking.<br>  You sound like a good mom, and you shouldn't feel bad about what you did. I honestly think that saying you hated him was a bit much, and I think you should have said "I don't like the way you're acting right now." Raising a teenager is not easy, because teens are backtalkers, and feel they can get away with it. So, hang in there. He'll get better over time.<br>  Right now, just try to get to the root of his problem<br>  Good luck<br>  =)|`|AA10267825	*sigh* I'm a single mom too and god knows its rough. Seems to me that he is getting in trouble but not with anything outrageous. I would like to suggest that you set goals for him and strict consequences for acting up. (hard grounding, no computer etc., yard work, and so on or even worse for a 15 yr. old boy, spending his free time glued to your side! lol). It's obvious his father will not help so you have to take it on yourself to help him. He needs you to talk to him, explain stuff to him and so on. Just let him know the behavior is not to be tolerated and there will be sucky consequences EVERY time!|`|zATQaiwIaa	Im not going to tell you that you are not a good mom - EVERY good parent loses their cool at some point.<br>  <br>  Your son is trying to fit and find himself. but his being a serious diabetic complicates the whole thing.  Im sure your son will sit and sulk - but try having an ADULT conversation with him.  Take him to dinner - and tell him you understand that he is trying to grow up into the man he will become someday and you just want to help him make the right decisions.  But you wont be able to step back and give him the space he needs unless he can show you some maturity.  Ask him how he feels, are things ok at school, anything bothering him....dont pound the questions at him - try to get him to talk on his own.<br>  <br>  BUT - if he refuses to act rationally - then be the parent and lay down some laws....for each class he skips he gets a day of grounding (and stick to this!!!!), smoking - take his phone or his xbox or playstation for a period of time, - he may be 15 and trying to grow but he is still a child and you are still the parent.|`|nDHyeDVoaa	I think you need to sit down and have a civil heart to heart with your son. He could be merely acting out irrationally because of something in his life (not enough attention, feeling uncool at school, etc.) Get to the root of his problems and then reason with him. I'm sure he's a smart enough kid to listen, but always remember... you are his mother first and friend second.|`|8uVGPhqYaa	as a teenager, oftentimes you feel like nobody cares about you and anger when it hits can take over anything welse for the moment. so just stick by him , know that youre that to listen, and try    to stay calm tho ur allowed to be angry. maybe he needs attention. but never tell him you hate him that makes him feel terribly alone, i would know,|`|2SzLx5Knaa	i believe that your a great mom.<br>  i am 13...<br>  when you told your son you hated him, it probably took effect.<br>  you have probably sat down and talked to him.<br>  but you need to threaten him with like services, <br>  ones that he doesn't like.<br>  make him do things he doesn't like.<br>  he will learn.<br>  take things away from him.<br>  tell him that he has to earn them back.<br>  good luck.<br>  hope it helps.<br>  (:|`|qjy5OirNaa	thats how all teens are, you are not the only one in that situation, you shouldnt say u hate him, but there is nothing wrong with a little corporal punishment, but not in the head.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	I think you need to explain to him how you feel about him skipping school and how its effecting you, and you should take away his person items such as computer/mobile ECT.|`|XTj0LP6gaa	Set down some rules and consequences for his actions and hold him to it.|`|6660bd3487fdb3fab7958bd2216d1e06aa	My daughter took a trip on the dark side very similar to your story - except she doesn't have diabetes. My mother once said the difference between a "phase" your kid goes through and something becoming a way of life is that someone puts their foot down and stops it in the "phase" stage.<br>  <br>  Glad to say that my daughter is back to her sweetpea self but man what a battle...my suggestion is try talking to the father - I know he doesn't help much now but then that's probably because he is taking it all for granted - also talk to anyone else who can back you up - or will get involved - we had to get to business with grandma, aunts and cousins when she started off! Mostly though, stay the course keep trying things until they work - you aren't a bad mom, these darn kids don't come with manuals!!! Good luck|`|9HPAzlYBaa	WELL I KNOW YOU WERE ANGRY BUT TRY TO REFRAIN FROM SAYING THE WORDS "I HATE YOU" BECAUSE THAT CAN START PROBLEMS WITHIN ITSELF.<br>  <br>  YOU JUST NEED TO REALLY START GETTING INVOLVED WITH YOUR CHILD AND WHO HE`S HANGING OUT WITH..HE`S 15 YRS OLD..TAKE CONTROL AND DON'T BE SCARED, YOUR THE PARENT. YOU KNOW WHATS BEST AND WHAT YOU WANT. START SETTING RULES AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE RULES IF THEY`RE BROKEN.<br>  <br>  MOST IMPORTANTLY HE`S A BOY SO TRY TO GET HIS FATHER INVOLVED. I`M SURE THAT WILL HELP A LOT. IF HE DOESN'T WANNA HELP THEN JUST DO THE BESTYOUY CAN..PRAY HONEY..PRAYER CHANGES THINGS!!
5aJ6E3JFaa	This is so stressful but you have lots going for you.  You may already know that it can take the average couple w/ NO fertility issues a year to conceive.  I always recommend just going straight to your dr - they may likely say to wait the year especially if there is no obvious reason why you would be having a problem.  I know that 5 months seems like FOREVER when you are TTC but you're actually not at the point when you should actually worry - but yeah that doesn't help w/ the impatience!  Keep doing what you're doing and try to "let go of the outcome" as much as you possibly can - and if you can't then don't spend more time worrying about the fact that you're worrying, just hang in there and know that the chances are extremely likely that you will be pregnant very soon!  Are you using the ovulation predictor kits that you can get over-the-counter?  If not they could help pinpoint more exactly when you are ovulating and at least give you something to do to have some sense of control over what is happening.  Good luck to you  :)|`|nVeZzuFvaa	85% of couples conceive within one year of having unprotected sex. So it might take a few more months, just be patient! I know its hard, but it will come! Go see your doctor if you are truly concerned, sometimes they will give you something like clomid to induce ovulation to help with the process, so you aren't missing it. Sometimes they wont until you are TTC for at least a year. But good luck and baby dust! I am TTC as well, and its so frustrating!!!!!|`|ce8COixxaa	Just keep trying! After you have sex, lay there for a while before letting anything drip out. Enjoy making love and be aware of your fertile times and eventually that will lead to a baby :) Lots of baby dust to you!|`|oHNrktxTaa	You are doing all the right things. As frustrating as this may be I would try to stay calm, relax, & be positive. It will happen:))<br>  <br>  A few suggestions that may be helpful:<br>  <br>  Stay in bed after ttc & prop a pillow beneath you & hold your legs up for 20 minutes. It will help the sperm flow to where they need to go. I would also avoid uriniating right after.<br>  <br>  Also, statistics show that it can take a healthy couple in their 20's up to a year to get pregnant. It will happen, all in due time.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck & baby dust!|`|Wzws8v8daa	it's only been 5 months.. on average, a healthy couple will conceive after trying for 6 months.  if you try for a full year and still do not get pregnant then it is time to see a fertility specialist

AA11100890	You mean long term damage to one areola/ nipple, or just soreness?  I think most breastfeeding women have one breast that produces more and therefore looks bigger.  You have exaggerated this by letting the baby nurse from only one side.  Using both would help balance them- I'm thinking in a week or so, but they'll never be completely balanced.  I know from experience.  <br>  Why can't you pump?  Manual breast pumps work pretty well because you can control the suction and rate yourself.  Pumping the smaller breast would also help your unevenness if you can't nurse on that side.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Get a nipple shield, a silicon pad with holes that goes over your nipple when you nurse, made by Medela or Avent - it will help heal your nipple.   And nurse him on the left side first every time, even if he fusses - and try different positions to get him to nurse from that side.<br>  <br>  Nursing should not damage your nipples or areolas, they are actually helped by nursing as it lowers the risk of breast cancer in the future.  Nursing should not hurt, if it does you need some help from a lactation specialist on latch.  I know my youngest REALLY liked my left side, but damned if I was going to be lopsided so we always started on the right, took it too far and my right got a little bigger then the left but my point is he can learn to nurse properly and so can you.

pXSKSS3daa	Not at every one, no. He had them at 2, 4, and 6 months thus far. They didn't do them at his 9 month appointment but will at his year appointment.<br>  <br>  Is your daughter on a delayed schedule? Or are you spacing out the vaccines? It may also be different because of where you live. I'd ask to get a list of each and every vaccine she's getting, though, and double check with another doctor or look it up on the internet to see if it's "normal". You CAN deny the vaccine if you do not feel safe with it, so keep that in mind.|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	yes and they are done this way for a reason...certain shots are given in sets that need to be given during a certain time span...the same will happen later in life when she will have to get more vaccines and you'll have to take her to the doc every so many months to get the series of shots<br>  <br>  Also, some dr's offices run out of certain vaccines and will give them at the next visit...happened twice to me|`|AA11832068	Yes, mine both have and it is perfectly normal.  I will link you to the recommended schedule.  I commend you for paying attention, but also for getting the vaccines.  With all the misinformation out there, it is easy to make the wrong decision.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You are confused by the term "well baby visit", these visits are generally only scheduled to administer vaccines, the schedule would be different if it was to check developmental milestones or something useful.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	no my children had 3 when they were 2-3 mnths and the mmr when they were a year old and booster when they started nursery,im in the uk? are you? because if not maybe it is different here xx|`|Ye88kT6Uaa	Yep!!  Its normal to get shots at every check up..the only one my kids didn't get shots at was the 9 month wellness check cuz the shots could be given at 12 months.  At 2 yrs. she should only need a finger poke to check for lead levels unless she is behind on vaccinations then they will make it up at the 2 year check.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	My son has had shots at all appts. except 9 months.  <br>  <br>  Your clinic may just space out vaccinations differently.
vygYFdsSaa	Of course it's possible!! Everyone's different. I didn't show at all at 11 weeks but at 14 weeks I feel HUGE lol :)|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Im 9w 6 days and have a bump :)|`|7PbJWEo1aa	yep you can.|`|zoyw8CRKaa	Hi there.<br>  <br>  Yes it is certainly possible, i am only 5ft and a size 12 with baby number 1 and i started to show at 9 weeks i am now 20 weeks and huge, i go to a prenatal class and a women there is due in 5 weeks time and i am nearly as big as her lol, i am gonna be mahoosive. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy. xx|`|xq7S9H5Raa	usually those who have had babies before tend to show faster than new pregos.  If you are extremely skinny then it is possible.|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	Could be twins, so yes definately possible!|`|DNygQdmVaa	I guess its possible.<br>  <br>  I had a baby bump at 16 weeks.|`|NfbDQ1tYaa	i am 5ft 10 and was about a siz 8-10, when i got pregnant with my son, i had my 1st  scan at 11 weeks and i had one hell of a bump :P i went on to have my lil boy at 38wks and 9lb 1oz, i hope its smaller this time hehe :P<br>  <br>  i am about 5-6 weeks now and im getting a lil one now !|`|24oK8bmSaa	yes. especially if its your 2nd pregnancy.<br>  my 1st i had a small bump until 6mo then i started to show alot.<br>  2nd pregnancy i had a small bump till about 3 months and every week i seem to get bigger now <br>  <br>  Good luck and have a happy pregnancy|`|9x7yp67Naa	We'll I am 13 weeks and my belly disappears in the morning but it comes out later on the dayband.

weBvwrloaa	no, infact, some doctors  even suggest using an additional spermicide to help guard against an unwanted pregnancy. You can use gels, foams, or different inserts. It will not harm your birth control pills effectiveness or vice versa. It's smart actually. If your having sex without a condom (secure relationship or just risky) and just relay on the pill, this is the "back up".|`|EUTRJqCsaa	No, birth control pills keep you from ovulating.<br>  spermicide kills sperm.<br>  <br>  they do two different things and it's great to use both. =)|`|MZWdvdEwaa	No.<br>  It makes it more effective, Since you are using birth control and spermicide just builds a block to keep sperm out.<br>  <br>  They don't mingle with each other.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	There are studies that have shown spermicide to be dangerous over time, so be careful!|`|zwctZ812aa	No, they have no effect on eachother.  BC pills keep your body from ovulating, and spermicide kills the sperm.  They work together if anything.  If for some reason your body had released an egg even though you were on BC pills, the spermicide should help to keep sperm from fertilizing it.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	No.  It's a great idea to use both!
H0fXySX9aa	the risks go down but can still happen any time <br>  its growing pains its your uterus expanding<br>  try not to worry hun|`|TljXiSNnaa	i am also 15 weeks and my mom just told me that they are growing pains. nothing to worry about hun just think of it as your baby getting cozy!!! goodluck|`|DNygQdmVaa	you can call your doctor or go to the ER just to make sure everythings okay.<br>  <br>  your in your 2nd trimester so the chances of miscarrying drop alot, but its still possible.<br>  i miscarried at 14 weeks.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	You're probably just growing if you don't have any bleeding to go with it. If they are severe though, call the doctor. I think the chance decreases dramatically after about 12 weeks. I remember having little pains, but it was just stretching.|`|sAbah6dTaa	id say uterus growing. it's very low i'd think especially after the first trimester. id only worry if you were bleeding. =)<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats.|`|vEVtXftTaa	It's probably nothing (meaning it's probably Braxton-Hicks or just normal cramping) but call your OBGYN at the very least!!|`|rlMbcfpXaa	Hi there! I have gotten cramps periodically throughout my pregnancy and they are always scary. It is generally your uterus that is growing.  LIke someone else said, if you aren't bleeding, don't worry. If you are bleeding some with it, you may want to call the OB.  Your miscarriage chance dropped significantly after 13 weeks, so I would say that you are fine!  Good luck to you!|`|y38cvIn9aa	Are they fleeting pains or like period cramps? After 13 weeks, your chances of micarriage drop, and you are more unlikely to have one, they don't, however, disappear. If you're concerned, call your doc.

4d30bae197e9f26ea7d5a4f3dbb92048aa	I had this happen.There are a few things you can do to help .Go to a health food store there you will find brewers yeast pills ,and a tea called mothers milk tea.Both work incredible for increased milk production.Brewers yeast is much easier than drinking a beer,it also taste better.I also think it works a ton better.You do not have to do the tea and brewers yeast pills ,but I would definitely do the pills.The biggest thing is to continue pumping as if the baby was eating every couple of hours.Good luck!!!|`|yB5go5wbaa	I'd keep doing what you're doing and see how much you're pumping after 3 days - that's about how long it takes for the body to adjust to an increased or decreased demand for milk.  You could try eating oatmeal or taking an herbal supplement.  Make sure you drink plenty of water too.<br>  <br>  My mom told me a beer would help with my supply, but I'm not sure if that's true or not - she also grew up in the 60's when they said it was okay to smoke and drink during pregnancy, haha.  Good luck regardless!|`|08GDBedGaa	eat enough and drink enough water, try not to be too tired, and try fenugreek,it really works!! :) also remember a pump wont activate your production as much as a baby's suckle, there is that hormone produce, while feeding, looking at your baby which does unexplainable things!!|`|deIzFnV8aa	Your supply will pick up again. In the short term, warm showers/compresses really help the milk get flowing. And I read somewhere teh eating a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast also helps increase supply. I don't know if that is true, but if you happen to like oatmeal anyway, it can't hurt to try.|`|AA11540024	if you don't pump as much for a short period of time the milk will reduce. Just keep pumping and it will probably come back in.|`|mPfknxJSaa	be around your baby when it cries.|`|5DJcir9saa	Just keep on pumping and try to get everything flowing again.  You may also want to talk to your doctor.  I had a hard time getting my milk to even come in in the first place so the doctor gave me a prescription that was supposed to help me produce milk.  Unfortunately I was allergic to it, but you may have better results.  I have also heard that there is an herbal tea called Mother's milk that is supposed to help w/milk production.  I too have heard that idea about a single beer, but haven't seen any proof.
DwFDF0A2aa	I think it sounds like chapped skin.  Try some Calendula cream on her face a few times a day.  It is a really natural cream that smells good as well.|`|qbZKBSFHaa	I personally wouldn't put anything on her face.  It may irritate her skin even more.  Avoid perfumed soap, baby oil, animals, her hands and any contact with anything that may cause it to flare up and get her to the pediatrician asap.  <br>  <br>  When my son was between 1 & 2 he developed this rash on his cheeks that would get really bad when his nose was stuffy/runny. He would break out on his inside arm near his elbow too.  I kept his face clean and tried to keep him from touching his face until we got him to the doctor.  He was diagnosed with eczema brought on by allergies and was prescribed Protopic ointment. My son is 3 now and when he has breakouts, I still use it and it clears it right up.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|F4XaPnXHaa	It could be chapped skin in which case E45 cream would sort it out, or it could well be eczema in which she may need cream prescribed by the doctor.  Ps vaseline works wonder on children's dry skin particularly on the face, as protects it and prevents it gettin any dryer.  Hope that helps
weBvwrloaa	having sex can not outwardly change your physical appearance. Every one is a little nervous or scared their first time. This is normal.  Having sex will not affect your cycle it's self. But having unprotected sex will, it's called pregnancy. Be smart. Use birth control.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	ouch, anal sex? hunny you dont have to worry about regular sex then, except for getting pregnant, Sex= Babies so talk to him about possible pregnancy before you do anything, ABORTION IS NOT BIRTH CONTROL. your friend got chunky because she probably eats to much and dosent exersise enough, sex will not make you fat, or change your body like that, but you might have trouble sitting for a while. you may bleed your first time but thats normal, your period will come when it comes, sometimes if i have sex my period will come early<br>  <br>  I got pregnant when using birth control and condoms so dont think if you use every method possible that you wont get pregnant cause you can<br>  <br>  you can get pregnant, on your period, in the shower, in water, if your on top, if your on bottom, if any of his sperm gets in you, you can get pregnant from pre-***, the pull out method dose not work, it is the least effective way to prevent pregnancy, if you wear two condoms the risk of breaking increases due to friction. Pregnancy can happen before you get your period, its rare but it happens. Remember no glove then no love|`|8V39PymEaa	your not ready if your that worried and you sound under 16 and i'm not trying to be mean so don't get the wrong idea|`|fHgbL046aa	If you are to scared to have sex then obviously your not ready. Tell your boyfriend how you feel. If he leaves you cause you won't have sex then you know he didn't love you. You need to be mature, responsible and want to have sex with your boyfriend. Not scared to death to do it. You will not feel comfortable and you may feel like you made a mistake.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	well i think that the decision of sex should come from you and your man just keep in mind that when you have sex its a constant worry for you about being pregnant every month its ahh thank god i got my period even if you get on birth control which is a very good option when you don't want kids sex can prolong your period at first but just remember sex can bring you guys so much closer and so far apart its complicates things because it can fog your true feelings its all you dear good luck|`|IA5zVfk0aa	what your friend told you isnt true lol.. if you stress your period will be late too, anal would hurt more than intercourse.. if you feel your ready than congrats, but i waited for my wedding night and it was wonderful! good luck :)|`|AA11100890	Whoa, slow down sista!!  You had anal sex, but you've never gotten your period!??  Are you sure you actually had anal sex?  That's way more personal (in my opinion) than real sex. <br>   No, sex will not delay your period.  Unless you get pregnant- which could happen before you get your first period.  <br>  Your body will not really change with sex, but with anal sex it could.  Hemorrhoids, a colon perforation, rectal prolapse...Ok the last two would be more rare, but I'm a nurse and I know they would suck to get.|`|e4ec8a26064d1b408b4d493f2b6d5d8baa	Your friend is silly if she thinks your legs look more opened up, that simply is not the truth. Do all women walk around looking bowlegged? No they don't!<br>  <br>  As for your period it doesn;t have any effect on it unless it makes it come early or your pregnant. <br>  <br>  Just be careful and use protection.|`|x84MEAv5aa	ok, I have to tell you.. If your doing something you don't want your mom to know about, you should not do it!<br>  <br>  Secondly, I got pregnant at 18 and even then my legs didn't look opened up as you put it!!!!<br>  <br>  Your to young.... Wait until your old enough to "know the truth" about what might or might not happen after !!!!|`|ckgiPMm4aa	If your really scared, then your not ready.<br>  Stick with the Anal, everyone is safer that way.|`|uxmqgmCCaa	if you need to ask questions like this then you are so not ready for that kind off relationship.|`|bx6OKLIbaa	yes ur friend is right thats wrong way|`|UzFWLTquaa	O_o  First off, anal sex is I'm sure by far more painful than vaginal sex so don't worry about the pain.  And your friend is a bit odd by the sound of it lol.  Your legs don't "open up".  Nothing physical except from your hymen breaking changes after you have vaginal sex.  Having sex does not make you gain weight at all (in fact its like exercise), and your period does not take longer after you have sex, everything is the same except for your hymen is broken now.  Trust me.  Oh and make sure he wears a condom and that he reads the directions first!  Be safe.^^
H0fXySX9aa	all women put on weight differently hun there is no set weight just a guide line|`|zwctZ812aa	I'm 20 and gained 33 pounds.  My doctor said that was great weight gain.  A gain of 25-35 pounds is considered the safe amount of weight to gain for a woman of average size, regardless of her age.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Age doesn't matter when it comes to pregnancy weight gain.  Your pre pregnancy weight and height is what matters.  Typically 35lbs.|`|mxixfE3Raa	Weight gain during pregnancy (no matter what age) is as follows (oh and by the way, the weight gain stated is what weight you should have gained altogether, (for e.g when I say you should gain 0-4lbs by weeks 13-16, that means that you should have gained a total of 0-4lbs, and not that during weeks 13-16 you will gain an extra 0-4lbs) If you know what I mean lol :<br>  1-8 weeks = No weight gain<br>  9-12 weeks = Up to 2lbs (1kg) but sickness may cause weight loss.<br>  13-16 weeks = 0-4lbs (0-2kg)<br>  17-20 weeks = 4-6lbs (2-3kg)<br>  21-24 weeks = 11lbs (5kg)<br>  25-28 weeks = 18lbs (8kg)<br>  29-32 weeks = 18lbs (8kg)<br>  33-36 weeks = 22lbs (10 kg)<br>  37-40 weeks = 30lbs (13.5kg)<br>  <br>  So 30lbs is the average weight gain by the end of pregnancy.|`|03f100b7d34df8ee17796e093fefa637aa	I know age doesn't matter and every person is different.

jXndHFm3aa	I would either seek a second opinion with another doctor or take her to a gastro specialis to have them run tests to see if it's normal.|`|ybdNwzMBaa	That is not normal,report that Doctor asap.Our son had a problem its a bot thing  but strip your girl when you feed her a bottle and watch her stomach if you see a line down her body the valve on the outlet of his stomach was not working right closing when it should have opened <br>  Pyloric stenosis is the medical term.<br>  Goats milk is also one you could try as some babies prefer it.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	"Her DOCTOR said it's normal."<br>  <br>  I'm not specialist, but get some more opinions from different doctors - I don't like the sound of it at all.|`|TczFL0p0aa	Yea this doesn't sound normal I would take her to the doctor and not leave until they have found out what's wrong with her, explain what's happening and (if it's normal) then why is it normal? don't take no for an answer! in this case don't take "everything is fine, leave!" for an answer. that's what I'd do, your her mom when you know something is wrong, there is something wrong!<br>  You don't mention if her bms are normal, if they are then that's weird if they're not she may have some kinda weird bowel problem.<br>  good luck!|`|WLoQOpPSaa	Ask your doctor for a referral to hospital if you are worried, is there another doctor in the practise you could see?<br>  11 months is a long time to have this happen, babies do often bring back milk but it usually settles down, a change of milk is usually all it takes. Your baby will be on solids and drinking less baby milk so you really need to speak to someone maybe your health visitor can help put you in touch with someone who can help.|`|CIBtfxEqaa	She might have acid reflux. My daughter has acid reflux and throws up some but not every time. You probably just need to talk to the pediatrician, you may need to change kiddo's formula. We also have Hadley on Prevacid and Reglan, and the combo really helps her with the crying, spitting up, and it definitely helps her sleep better. Just ask the pediatrician, that's what they are there for!|`|ps11uX4Naa	hiya,<br>  id talk to your health visitor, it doesnt sound normal, my daughter was sicking up almost all her milk after every feed from the day she was born and at 2 weeks my health visitor said it looks like reflux but to mention it to the dr so i did and his response was well all babies bring up some of their feed, so i left it but when i spoke to my health visitor the next time at 5 weeks she made me an appointment with a different dr and he said to try a thickener for her milk which has worked ever since, my daughter was only on milk where as yours is on solids so im not sure what it could be but i would deffinatly make an appointment with your health visitor as they specialise with children and she maybe able to advice you on what to do, <br>  good luck<br>  xxx|`|MavosJHYaa	If it is just a little bit it is probably ok. But is she is throwing up large amounts at a time it may not be. <br>  <br>  We are having the same  problem right now but my baby is only 4 months. She has been doing it since birth. It was always just a mouthfull at most, but the last week she has been throwing up enough to cover her, me, and a full size bath towel(I stopped even trying to use burp rags). <br>  <br>  If you are concerned talk to your doctor. If you don't feel they are concerned enough then get a second opinion. I feel like my baby's doctor thinks I'm crazy but as far as I'm concerned this is not OK. Mommies usually know best. Go with your gut.|`|FDpalItSaa	Hi, how much is she vomiting?  Just a mouthful or two or lots..?  My daughter is 8.5 months old and is always a bit sicky after her food, normally just a mouthful.  I can't wait for the day when I can take her out without a bib on!!  My health visitor said aslong as it's just a mouthful or two not to worry, she should grow out of it in the next few months.  My friend's daughter was the same until she turned 1.<br>  <br>  If it's more I would definitely get a second opinion.|`|e4ec8a26064d1b408b4d493f2b6d5d8baa	Take her to gastro specialist. They can run tests. My daughter was allergic to milk and it caused her to do this. She just may have bad acid reflux which you can also get medicine for.
vygYFdsSaa	It's very possible, but the cramping could have been due to any number of things. Take a test on the 23rd, and good luck!!!! I hope you get the result you're hoping for.|`|zwctZ812aa	Could be! That's about the same time I got pregnant with my son last year! Your due date should be the first few days in November if you are pregnant! I had a little bit of cramping and thought I was going to start my period but never did...so looks like you're experiencing the same thing! I hope it goes the way you want it to!|`|LBg4DNpCaa	could be.|`|4aguqVyIaa	I say take a test!  It may turn out negative even if you ARE pregnant, but if you get a BFP then you get to celebrate early! :D  Good luck!
