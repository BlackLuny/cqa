20090307182109AAvCs2o	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Hollister jeans....girls, do you like them?	Okay, this is a serious question and I am seventeen, btw. When you girls, especially those who wear a lot of hollister jeans and stuff, do hollister jeans ever get uncomfortable? Like do they ever get uncomfortable to move around in? Cause it seems like I always see girls, again those who wear hollister, having to constantly pull them up by the belt loops and they look really embarrassed doing it. I've even seen some girls do it every five seconds. They look really awkward, like having to shift and pull to only get a couple of centimeters. It must be soooo embarrassing...      Not to be a jerk or anything, but I think its kinda funny when girls have problems with their jeans. I mean, why torture yourselves by wearing tight jeans to show off the body but then be all worried about what's showing?

20090307182133AAP1mxQ	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	What does he mean by this?	In Stephenie Meyer's "Breaking Dawn" it reads:      "It seems that I have more to apologize for." He frowned.   "I didn't dream that you would construe the way I feel about what I did to you to mean that last night wasn't ... well, the best night of my existence. But I don't want to think of it that way, not when you were..."      My lips curved up a little at the edges. "Really? The best ever?" I asked in a small voice.            Exactly what did Edward mean when he said that? It's on page 92, last paragraph.      I know wrong section.

20090227103429AASe5kv	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Any ideas on how to heal the holes from piercings?	Alright, I got snake bites pierced Tuesday. So it's only been 3 days yeah, and I realize that you have to give it time to heal and whatnot due to swelling and whatever. But I can already tell that this guy did not pierce them right. The right side is definitely not lined up with the left. Even if I were to give it a week or two to fully heal, I do not see the piercing somehow moving into place and looking right you know. It's also way too damn close to my lip...so anyways. I emailed him, he said I could drop in and get the right side redone. He really was pretty close, so the new piercing would not be far from the original you know. Oh yeah, now the question...hah. When he takes the piercing out, it will obviously leave a hole there for a while, right? I've had my left side peirced 3 times before, and the times I left it out, even after like 3 or 4 months or longer, the little hole was still visible. But since this other side has only been pierced for a short time, will it leave a hole just like that? If so, what could I do to make it..disappear? When he repierces the right side I don't want there to be a lil hole next to it forever, you know? Hope I somehow made sense in all this..

There is a ringtone called "rock melon" created my a Dr. Tomabechi a Japanese man supposedly to increase breast size. You can see the video about him on youtube, it was on discovery channel. They tried it on a girl and over ten days her breasts size increased 3 cm.      Have any of you tried it? It's supposed to be hard to get in the US. So I put a link to the video about it and the link where you can download it for free.      By the way, I'm not sure if Yahoo will allow me to put links. So go onto Youtube and type " breast enlarging ringtone" and it the first one in with a Japenese title. Don't worry it's in english. For the download website google "mobango rock melon" it will be the first item.        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z30Z4iZSn...        http://www.mobango.com/media_details/roc...

I'm looking for a nail polish that looks like this:       http://farm1.static.flickr.com/81/381420...       or if you have seen the music video to Lady Gaga's song Love Game:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb9Pn1w13...       at 0:07-0:08, the next scene immediately after that when she has her hand on her face, or anywhere else that you can see her nails that look like it's a silver metallic color (usually in the scenes where she's covered in the diamonds.)  Anyway, if  you do know of a nail polish that looks like that, please answer this question.  Please, nothing sheer or see through.  I want it to be a solid color, thick, like the nail was painted in metal. Thanks so much for your help! :-)
20090307202614AAVw9qi	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Stubborn pimple, help anyone?	Pretty gross, yes, but I had a stubborn pimple on my forehead for quite some time. I have bought a high quality acne scrub with exfoliates in it and that's gotten it to go down, but there's some hardened form of it still there under the skin, I refuse to pop it since that leaves scaring, but am not sure how to rid it at this point. I am not prone to acne, I just get the occasional pimple, so one like this irritates me.      Any suggestions?      Thanks! :)

Not feminine heels like stilletos or whatever, but say he put lifts in his sneakers to make himself taller.       I put lifts in my shoes, I'm like 5'6" naturally and am around 5'9" with lifts. I wear a really big shoe so I can put in more (size 13), and there's a bump in my sneaker which is my foot, because it barely fits in. I also do walk a bit slow and awkward with these shoes, but they make me about average height.      How would you feel if your boyfriend did this? Is it a turn-off?

I have a dark blonde, near light brown color of hair, and would really like to lighten my hair by a couple shades. No platinum blonde or anything, just something a little lighter.       Do you think there is a way to do this to make it look like I was in a place with a lot of sun, so that I do not need to go back and re-color it? Or is that impossible?      By the way, I do know about Sun-In and all of those other products, but I do not want to take my chances on them. I actually do love my hair and the way it feels, but I do want it to be a little lighter.

20090227120443AAzS7ZW	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Why do the girls from 'Sex and the City' always get all dressed up to go nowhere?	Have you ever noticed that even when they are just going out together for coffee they seem to be all dressed up?  When they go to bars and nightclubs that probably are meant for anyone dressed in regular street attire to drop in they often are wearing cocktail dresses.  Does dressing in this way uplift them and give them a feeling that they are rising above the mundane?      Furthermore, do you think they dress kind of weird most of the time?  One picture I saw of them showed them standing together around the time of Fleet Week against a backdrop of green leaves.  Carrie was wearing a big knit sweater with a turtleneck and lightweight capri length pants.  Her look was out of balance.  Samantha was wearing leggings and high heels as well as a bulky-looking jacket.  Charlotte looked her usual pinched and constrained self in a trench coat, carrying a black patent leather purse like the Queen frequently carries around on public duties.  The only one who looked normal at all was Miranda, who was standing next to Charlotte in blue jeans and a t-shirt.      Do women really aspire to dress like these four frenzied girls?  Is it only because the media makes it appear that they are fashion role models that people pay attention to how they are dressed?  I could swear that living too close to Yonkers has made them go bonkers!

20070912062741AAxWwRm	Beauty & Style;Hair	African American Hair...How can I strengthen my hair and get it to grow?	Recently, I saw a pic of a girl I used to go to high school with (about 5 yrs ago).  Her hair used to be pretty short, maybe right at the shoulders.  NOW...her hair has grown to the middle of her back and it's quite thick and has so much body.  What on earth am I doing wrong?  My hair is a bit long (about 3 inches past my shoulders), but it's thin at the ends and on the sides of my head.  I'm thinking about chopping off a couple of inches and starting over.  I've heard sooooo many techniques, but I'm confused as to what may really work on my damaged hair.  When I was growing up, my mother said that the reason my scalp would become dry was b/c I didn't use enough grease on it.  But now, I'm reading everywhere that we should use oils instead of heavy hair grease.    Some also suggest deep conditioning, but to be quite honest, I've never done that before.   My hair has never been permed before, only pressed with a hot comb.    Does anyone have any suggestions??

And please no crap about tattoos are uncool and such and such. Thanks in advance.

20090307095925AAmkrXU	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Will u stop wearing UGGS 2 save the poor sheep?	Will U stop buying them and wearing them???       Do u know that so many sheep have been killed that they can't keep up with demand? That’s y there sold out       Will u stop wearing them now?       Do u feel sorry 4 the sheep?       Do you have to really kill the poor sheep just to make a pair of UGG boots?    The answer is YES. The sheep has to be slaughter to obtain their hide and fleece. Now once the sheepskin hides are taken from the sheep then the process of preparing the hide for manufacturers and ensuring the hides are up to export standard begins.       Woolskins are usually preserved with salt prior to being processed by tanneries. At the tannery the skins are processed in large vessels called paddles which vary in capacity from 3000 to 15000 liters. In contrast to hide processing, in woolskin processing mechanical action is kept to a minimum in order to minimize felting of the wool. Rotating blades on the paddles move the skins slowly and gently, and processing is performed at much higher float ratios (typically 20-35 liters of water per skin) than are used in hide processing.       Typically it takes about 10 working days for the skins to be tanned and finished ready to be cut into panels for ugg bootsUGG? Australia uses only the best quality sheepskin exclusively. Twin-faced sheepskin is used in many of our core products. A piece of twin-faced sheepskin has been treated on both the fleece side, and the skin side.       The wool of genuine sheepskin is extremely dense (more-so than any synthetic), which provides for a more comfortable and durable material.       Fleece breathes, wicks moisture away, and allows air to circulate, keeping feet dry.       Sheepskin is naturally water resistant & therefore small amounts of moisture will not seep through or damage it.       UGG? Australia sheepskin is naturally thermostatic & therefore will keep bare feet warm in temperatures as low as -30°F and cool in temperatures as high as 80°F (Sheepskin will naturally insulate by keeping feet warm in the winter & cool in the summer.)       The sheep that we use have finer wool & cleaner skin (skin!)

20090307162420AAUO6k0	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair style for wavy haired male?	ANY STYLE RECOMMENDATIONS?       I have long enough hair to try anything.       Thick, naturally wavy, I'm an asian.
20090307162208AAYFjfM	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair style for wavy haired male?	I am one of the people who takes quite some care about their looks.      I am a male in the age of 17. Currently I have straight hair. My natural hair is a little wavy, not extremely wavy but a touch so that you'll look and know that it's not straight.      When my hair gets long, all my hair curls to some direction which pissed me off, so I got it permanently straightened with chemicals.      As my hair started growing more, my straightened hairs pulled down the wavy hairs and prevented it from 'poofing up, curling' and etc, that I did not enjoy about my natural hair.   But as the ratio of natural hair : straightened hair became almost even and actually the natural hair might be bigger now, the poofing up and curling is starting to happen.      So this time, I want a shorter hair style. I have a long hairstyle considering I'm a boy. It's not just one of the 'just let it grow' kind of style, but I did put some management in it.   To give you a little idea, my side burns go below my ear, a little border (shorter) between my side burns and back hair. Back hair, just touches upon the shoulder if I put it on the front side. Not a long long like a girl style, but... yea.      I am an asian, and I have dark brown hair. If there is some lighting, the brown aspect shows. But if there is not much lighting it seems black.      My hair is thick, and I have many hair.         Any style recommendations? I want a short style. Not like a 'shaved' short, but considerably short. I have no problems with cutting most of them. But the thing is I do not want a typical hair style like almost everybody has. I want it short, but stylish. I guess you could say like the french people ;)         If showing my picture would help you, I am willing to. Please send me an email.      I have long enough hair to consider any style, so any suggestions!? If you want to see my picture, send me an email.
