t39iLe2taa	Front Desk Clerks, Guest Service Agents, and Front Office Associates, are all names for the same position.  I would suggest going to hcareers.com and searching for non-management positions that way you can get an idea of some of the requirements in your area.  In Oklahoma we require a work permit signed by school and parents authorizing work.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately you will be somewhat limited because of your age and school.  Many hotels only have one desk clerk at night so working at night may not be the best option.  But working during the day would conflict with school.  You also have to consider cash handling issues.  Most hotels operate at least two petty cash banks.  This is where having past food service experience comes in handy, even if it is fast food.  Responsibility in that job shows that you can handle money.  Wait until summer comes and your schedule frees up.  Working during the day is much easier because there are people all around who can answer questions and help out if needed.  Day shifts are usually from 7-3 or from 8-4.  <br>  <br>  Keep your head up and expect some age discrimination.  Being a desk clerk is one of the harder jobs at a hotel because you what is termed a "Front Line" employee.  That means you get it all and it is up to you to decide how to deal with it and who to tell about it.  If you can't get in a hotel position this summer try going to conflict resolution classes at your local community college.  This can only serve to boost your resume and will serve you well at a hotel's desk.  Being a former hotel desk clerk I've had keys thrown at me, been spit on, screamed at, and hit on.  I've also been hugged, given tips, and been offered other job opportunities.<br>  <br>  Other things front desk clerks are responsible for...<br>  Securing payment for room(s)<br>  Directing guests around town<br>  Ensuring that guests are properly blocked in rooms per their requests<br>  Signing them up for the hotels' rewards program<br>  Helping guests get on the Internet at the hotel<br>  Dealing with complaints<br>  Ensuring a guests' stay is as productive as it can be ----- most important.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like later in life you may be interested in Guest Relations.  This is the part of the hotel that gets the worst of the worst complaints.  But they are also the part that can make the biggest impact on a guests' stay or opinion of the hotel.  <br>  <br>  One more thing...if you do get an interview at a hotel you applied to...what will knock their socks off is if you bring in reviews of the hotel you're interviewing at from say travel.yahoo.com or www.travelpost.com, or www.tripadvisor.com and you critique them.  That is to say you, in your own words, describe how you could have helped out a situation before it turned into a negative comment on one of these websites.  It shows that you have a real understanding of what a hotel is really about...the guests.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|06PXqMYGaa	From what I understand it is pretty much impossible to get a job as a desk clerk at a hotel unless you have at least a bachelor's degree in hospitality. <br>  Best of luck!|`|MnFj47dxaa	A position at the front desk of a hotel is a great place to get an entry-level position.  It depends a lot on the hotel and their policies.  Some may start hiring at 18, but I knew a few girls in high school who were working at hotels, so they're not all like that.<br>  <br>  This type of position is also a great way to get your foot in the door in the hotel industry if you're at all interested in hotel/hospitality management.  It can be a very interesting career path with lots of options.<br>  <br>  Find a few nice places you'd like to work at, and contact their hiring manager.  Ask what the requirements are.  If a degree is required, ask if there are any other positions in the hotel (ie, hostess for the restaurant, etc) that you could start at and work your way up.  They will value the fact that you really want to work at their establishment and are anxious to work your way up the ladder.

vklFFQSraa	Yea man, too many youngins use the military as a way out, the military may look exciting and as the perfect getaway, but it is hard work.  I was in the Army and I spent every day wishing I was a civillian, I envied civillians.    When I was out, I really wanted to go back because I felt more proud as a soldier.  But,  trust me, get a good job--get with your girlfriend--and live a happy civillian life.  You two could be split apart in the military and if youre only serving to escape civillian life, you will most likely go AWOL because you'll feel like you're in jail.  I was a gung ho soldier and if I felt that way about being a civillian you definately will too...  As far as college goes.......Try to get loans that you can pay back after you graduate.  Try to get a co-signer.....If not, try to get into a union and do some work.  I have successful friends living good lives without the military or college........<br>  <br>  NAVY would be good if you were single, and you loved the military|`|7e7687515b0cfda20d8942e13b46fda9aa	Man, its your dicisson. But if i were you knowing what i know now. I would stop smell the flowers, get off my lazy *** and get a job that i'd stay with.<br>  <br>  I say this because it sounds like you can't handle freedom under your own rule. How are you going to handle that being gone, and you signing your body (your life) over for the next several years in a contract with the government that is going to tell you, "THEY OWN YOU"? Think about it...<br>  <br>  Yea, its tough i know, but you are not stupid, just lazy. So why take the chance and get your lazy *** killed? Go to a Tech school man.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you what, I went to a truck driving school 4 yrs ago, my income was 13,000 before going. My first year i busted 22,000 but now going on my 5th year, I found a local driving job, paid medical, paid vision, paid dental, perks, and work a 48/60  two week period. I get off when i need.. 2-day week one week and 3-day weekend the next... and busting 55,000/63,000 depending on how much extra i want to work.<br>  <br>  What im saying is that there are possibilities out there for you whatever you want. This is America, use its resourses, tap the wealth. You'll never do it in the military, except very select KEY positions, but you're to lazy to go for that though ...LOL just kidding man... <br>  <br>  But you need to do something, like you said, you have a g/f and a car pymnt and want to get yourselves an appartment. It all cost money...<br>  <br>  Its your dime to do time to make it work best for you!<br>  <br>  Good luck what ever you decide. Just don't let your mind go crazy and make a bad decission, ya know.|`|RqcvNYrFaa	you kno what..<br>  <br>  you see military as ur way out but no..<br>  find a nice job, that pays well(not hard if u give it ur best on finding 1) find a nice appt, move out w ur gf and have a nice life.|`|pU7QNuz8aa	Well the service will make or break you. A lot of goof off time but when needed go, go, go....Slack off your screwed. If your going in where's your GF going to live when you serve overseas? Your not going to be able to pay for that car.....Get a job and go to Jr. college, you'll be about 24..... By the time you get out of service and finish school you'll be 30....Just toughen it up dump the car maybe GF and go to school and get a job.....

Pn1YolaGaa	ciao cerchero di dare una risposta alle tue domande.<br>  Allora l' essere nella Unione monetaria è per noi un vantaggio perchè ci consente di bilanciare in misura modesta la crescita del petrolio e quindi dell' inflazione, quest' ultima è stata scatenata dalla crisi dei mutui subprime e dall' ormai certa crisi economica che ne seguira, ma proprio questa riporterà in giu i prezzi del petrolio.<br>  Mi spiego meglio:<br>  la crisi dei mutui ha portato la Fed ad abbassare i tassi di interesse, ma cosi facendo crea inflazione perchè il tasso di interesse influenza il tasso di cambio che in questo caso scende, ma se il dollaro scende il petrolio sale, poichè gran perte dell' energia di cui necessitiamo deriva dal petrolio anche i prezzi di tutti i beni salgono, quindi cresce l' inflazione, anche se lo scopo del taglio dei tassi è quello di rendere più convenienti i finanziamenti, perchè se il denaro mi costa meno di quanto mi rende investirlo in beni strumenteli allora io impresa mi indebito.<br>  Purtroppo la crisi dei muti ha creato una crisi di fiducia( a mio parere dovuta ai principi contabili intenazionali) perchè le banche non si fidano tra di loro, vedi i recenti fallimenti di una banca inglese e di una danese, questa sfiducia fa salire il tasso Euribor e di conseguenza il tasso praticato sui mutui.<br>  Di questa crescita le banche  ne erano consapevoli, per questo negli anni in cui i tassi erano bassi consigliavano mutui a tasso variabile, viceversa ora che sono alti consigliano mutui a tasso fisso, cosi sono premunite dalla discesa dei tassi, che avvera appena gli USA entreranno formalmente in recessione, cosa inevitabile, vedi difficolta di Fannie e freddie e loro salvateggio.<br>  Se non fossimo entrati nell' euro i nostri governi avrebbero accresciuto a dismisura il deficit con la conseguenza che i tassi sarebbero saliti più del resto dell' unione monetaria per compensare il rischio paese, con la caduta degli investimenti e quindi del Pil ovvero disoccupazione.<br>  spero di essere stato esauriente, ciao|`|uJ08lfj3aa	non riesco a spiegarlo in quanto convenienza nn ne ho vista io.. anzi.. °_°|`|28ea2fc06015a7e0096a3636fabb769daa	ma che stai a di'?<br>  guarda che quando c'era la lira l' inflazione era al 15%<br>  poi si è stati obbligati a mettere a posto i conti pubblici...<br>  se l' Italia sta male è perchè è governata da dei ciarlatani eletti da pecoroni<br>  <br>  ma per ora i risaprmi sono stati difesi<br>  <br>  forse non lo sai ma prima dell' euro (un paio di anni prima) il debito pubblico (dovuto alle ruberie ai nepotismi alle tangenti) era arrivato a un livello tale che l ' italia stava fallendo<br>  infatti il governo Amato fece una cosa illegale...una bella note prelevò i soldi degli italiani dai conti correnti.....<br>  poi svalutò la lira<br>  ricordo ad esempio che un franco francese valeva 230 lire il giorno dopo ne valeva 290<br>  quello svizzero 750 lire, il giorno dopo 1000<br>  queste misure erano ovviamente estremissime...evitarono realmente l' italia dal fallire<br>  fallire vuol dire che i tuoi risparmi, se li hai investii in fondi obligazionari o in bot o in buoni postali non ci sono più<br>  moltiplica la cosa per milioni di persone e capisci il problema sociale e econimico che si crea<br>  <br>  quindi in quegli anni stavamo falleno ...siamo arrivati a poche settimane dal falllimento e ripeto la cosa era dovuta alle ruberire di craxi e company (adesso va di moda rivisitare quegli eventi dimenticandosi molti fatti, molte prove, molte sentenze , molti soldi recuperati)<br>  vedi www.beppegrillo.it di oggi<br>  <br>  se non fossimo entrati nell' euro come potevamo tenere controllata l' infalzione? come potevamo competere con l' euro...cioè con il resto dei paesi di allora che avevano una economia forte e sana<br>  e su un debito di 1600 milioni di euro pagare gli interessi del 3% è cosa diversa dal pagare gli interessi al 12%<br>  questi interessi li paga lo stato , cioè noi con le tasse<br>  quelli sono tutti soldi risparmiati<br>  è il resto dell' europa che ha aspettato l'Italia che era il paese messo peggio di tutti (assieme al belgio...ma li il debito pubblico è dato da un welfare molto forte)<br>  il resto d' europa ci ha sostenuto mantenendo l' italia in un sistema in cui non aveva i numeri per starci obbligandoci a mettere a posto i conti pubblici in un modo o nell' altro<br>  inoltre un sitema chiuso come quello italiano si è dovuto aprire all' europa con il libero scambio mettendo così un ppo di concorrenza e abbassando i costi di alcuni servizi (banche ad esempio)<br>  <br>  insomma il grosso problema qui è il debito pubblico e come si è creato<br>  l' euro ci ha permesso di pagare interessi di 1/4 rispetto a quelli che si pagavano prima dell' euro<br>  e se metti che la situazione nel 92 era di uno stato a un passo dal fallimento capirai che ci si è obbligati a fare certe politiche per rimanere in linea con i requisiti richiesti per entrare nell' area euro<br>  infati quel governo prodi fu il migliore degli ultimi 30 anni...in 2 anni obbligò l' italia a rigare dritto e a rimettersi in piedi

I suggest you contact her, she can find you the best deal and figure out which provider would actually be best for you.  If you email her let her know what the zip codes the phone would be in.  She can use this to determine which provider would have the best coverage for you.  For example in my house, there is no Verizon coverage, but with T-Mobile, is the best for my area.  On the other hand my sister who lives in another city far away, I can't get reception in her house or office, but AT&T has perfect coverage there.  So it all depends on what zone your in.<br>  My friend also has access to promotional deals where you will most likely get free phones on two year contracts.

All of these tips and more are in the book by Dave Ramsey The Total Money Makeover.  get it at the library.  <br>  <br>  It helped me I am debt free and in the process of buying a house.|`|AA11845638	If you don't use any of the utilities, you'll be saving money.  If you work during the day, nothing is used, so no expense.  If you need to cook, cook once or twice a week.  If you have cable, go back to basic cable.  |`|4627db3161084bce021d06067966d9f0aa	really watch your thermostat.  If everyone feels "cold" or "hot", either wear more clothes or less clothes.  My biggest electricity savings was to practically turn the heat or air off during the day when we are working and gone for l0 hours or more; then turn it back to normal when we get home.  This made a dramatic drop in my bill.<br>  <br>  Water:  Don't leave the water running while washing dishes, or brushing your teeth.  Turn it on when you need it.  Make sure the dishwasher is full before you run it.  Fix the toilets so that they use less water to flush.<br>  <br>  Wash your clothes in cold water when possible (saves electricity) and line dry as many clothes as you can.  The dryer is a hog.|`|7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	Just be smart about it. For example, for your water bills, cut down on usage. Don't use your sprinklers too much. Use them sparingly, if at all. Don't wash your car during the day. Don't take baths, but also take quick showers. When at the sink, don't leave the water running. <br>  Gas usually doesn't cost too much, but if you're constantly using the heater or the A/C, you need to cut back. With the A/C, raise the thermostat to say, about 75 or so. Or just go without. Same with the heater. <br>  Get rid of your cable. It's not a necessity. I don't have cable, not since I was a kid have I had it, and I don't miss it. <br>  When it's hot, or very cold, head out to the malls or the stores, or, say you're going to a movie, go when the climate/temperatures are too much. <br>  As for your phone bill, just cut back on talking, don't call long distance. And if you have a cell phone plan, maybe consider getting rid of it, or just buy minutes.<br>  Hope that helps. Think conservation. Before you buy anything, ask yourself if you really want/need it. If you have any doubt, just put it off. You can buy it later.

It's a growing field right now and there is a shortage. There are many different fields within accounting, and they are all somewhat related, so it is not too hard to move around once you get your foot in the door.

ylYvDca9aa	For a lot of people, housing authority helps them. My mom and grandmother both live in housing now. Housing pays all the utilities and all you have to pay is a very cheap rent. I worked at a daycare also. It was within those Housing Authorities and most of the children and parents that relied on us to help them out live in that area. It is really a great system. Also my Grandmother works as the director of budgets so I know how it works. They get a grant to support the housing each year and as long as they keep the place looking good and their tenants happy (along with making sure everyone pays rent) they are awarded another grant the next year to keep it going.|`|AA11327039	If you are making minimum wage and you have a child under the age of 5 you can be eligible for WIC (Women Infants Children) you'd probably be available for hud housing or section 8 housing or even the ability to live in the projects. There is money available for child care for children who aren't in school whose parents make under a certain amount of money.  I would assume if you qualify for all of the above you'd also qualify for food stamps and a food stamp allowance is somewhere around $25 a week for just one person.  Probably $10 more for each additional child or something similar.<br>  <br>  For the income deprived it's a good idea to have a social worker handy to assist you with finding all the resources available.|`|AA11966821	Take a different approach.  What does an adult with a small child need to survive?  A place to live, utilities, transportation to work, child care....  Make your list, research the costs in the Denver area.  Then think of ways to cut the costs: child's father takes the child certain days/times, grandma can help, live with parents, make sure your getting the proper amount of child support from the father.  How do you cut utility bills?  How do you cut medical costs (clue: stay healthy... how you do that)?  How can two (or more) single parents team up to work shifts alternating with childcare?  How to cut housing costs -- share, live in a room/smaller apt/cheaper neighborhood...<br>  <br>  Of course, preventing single parenthood is the most effective way to prevent such problems.  Nothing is better for a child than to be wanted and cared for by both parents.<br>  <br>  I note all the other answers emphasize relying on taxpayers to support them instead of relying on themselves and getting the proper child support from the child's father.  Be more self-reliant.  It is possible!

You must improve yourself with education or acquired skills to move up to higher pay.  I just asked my 80 year old mother if enty level manual labor jobs ever afforded people a reasonable lifestyle.  NO.<br>  <br>  Community groups would have you believe that increasing the minimum wage makes a difference.  It doesn't.  All it accomplishes is higher prices for everyone or lost jobs.  <br>  <br>  The only way to help people at the bottom tier of the pay scale is to help them acquire needed skills.

It's not something to strive for though.  <br>  <br>  You would have to live on a budget.  Overtime or a second job would probably have to be done.  You would probably be eligible for WIC or other state or federal assisted services.  You get a paid for car that gets you to and from work-and that's about it.  You use public transportation.  You car pool.  You cook all meals.  Name brands mean nothing.  You look for what's on sale. Sales determine your menu.  You shop for clothes at second hand places.  No cable tv, no cell phone, no credit cards-you can't get into that hell hole at this level.  The public library is your best friend(free books, videos,etc).  No vacations except to visit relatives( free room and board).  <br>  This is not how you want to live life for very long.  But, it can be done.  Our grandparents and great-grandparents lived this way and survived.  <br>  <br>  Minimum wage isn't a career goal.  It's the least someone can pay you to work.  That's fine for teenagers and people just starting out.  Your long range goals need to be learning a skill, education, and/or moving up in a company.  There has to be a minimum rate of pay so that employees don't pay you in chickens.  But, it's not intended for you to live on while raising a family, saving, and living long term.  Just like social security was never intended as the sole income for retired or disabled citizens.|`|AA11943102	It is possible to survive on minimum wage. There's lots of ways to keep your budget down. Think of how many recent immigrants probably live in your area - they're not making mega bucks. <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to talk to your local service organizations - ie YMCAs, Junior Chamber, etc. so that they can hook you up with some people to talk to. <br>  <br>  On the more generic end - there's a few suggestions:<br>  <br>  1. Use public transit. Don't own a car - they cost too much to drive and maintain.<br>  <br>  2. Do a mostly vegeterian meal system. Meat costs much more to feed your kids.<br>  <br>  3. Try to get multiple minimum wage jobs. <br>  <br>  4. Rely on relatives for day care. <br>  <br>  5. Get a cheap apartment and get roommates - lots of multiple family units abound around where I live. <br>  <br>  6. Buy all clothes at thrift stores.<br>  <br>  7. Get food stamps, WIC, or other government aid. <br>  <br>  8. Rely on Medicare or no insurance at all. <br>  <br>  9. Don't own a computer - go to the library for all computer needs.<br>  <br>  10. Use as little utilities as possible. Water, electric, gas - all expensive. <br>  <br>  11. Have someone living in your house do chores - grandparents are great for this if they live with you. <br>  <br>  12. Clean naturally - vinegar and other natural cleaners cost a lot less than artificial ones.<br>  <br>  13. Never eat out. Meals are much cheaper made at home.<br>  <br>  14. Don't buy anything prepackaged - make it from scratch.<br>  <br>  15. Learn to sew and knit (or crochet) so that you can repair your clothes, make your clothes, repair your furniture, and make your own winter garments, blankets and other ways to keep warm. |`|AA11626101	You can sell the child for a pretty penny.|`|3c164991b5dd12efd35c9301be32c340aa	You would most likely have to live with your parents, or someone else. It's not possible to survive on minimum wage alone.|`|2GBhLRxDaa	Umm..... No clue?|`|WKzVfACvaa	Well- I don't live in Denver- I live in Richmond, VA. I'm a single mother of two (my kids are 2 and 3 years old) that goes to college full time and I live off minimum wage. One things is that anyone with that little money needs to go straight to social services. I get food stamps and my children recieve Medicaid. if it weren't for those food stamps i would really be out of luck with food prices the way they are, and you can't have small children without insurance. also, if you want to have a place it really helps to have a roommate, preferrably someone in the same boat as you so they'll undestand what you're going through. also, buy a cheap car with great gas mileage- i drive a '96 camry and survive on $10 in gas a day and the car makes it no doubt, wherever i want to go all day. there's no such thing a creative ideas when you're living paycheck to paycheck. you just have to be frugal, budget like your life depends on it becuse it actually does, don't spend on unnecessary things like eating out, movies, etc. cook at home, watch basic cable, get a house phone and get a basic minimum cell plan because if you're at home you can talk on that phone, take the kids to the park instead of mcdonalds, don't drive anywhere you don't absolutely have to, walk if you are able, and take advantage of government programs. also, to climb out of the hole you're in, go to school. as a single mom, i'm eligible for financial aid and anyone who doesn't take it is wasting a great resource. go to school- i know i can't live like this forever

I hope he has other experience.|`|lf3hHww5aa	To your first question, you do not need to list prison time on a resume. An experienced interviewer will however realize the "gaps" between jobs and will typically ask about them. If asked, you should absolutely answer honestly. Also, if when filling out an application, you find a question regarding "convictions", you must answer correctly. In some states, if you answer this question deceptively, it can be punishable, A.K.A., a crime. I myself am an employer, and have employed people who had done time. My best advice is to perform a confident, sincere interview. If you are put in a position of having to explain the time spent in prison, be direct, show remorse, make a statement to the effect that you have learned from your mistakes, but keep your explanation fairly brief. If you spend too much time explaining, it will appear like you aren't "over it", or ready to move on with your life. You will encounter people who will have a bias, but stay focused on where your going, not where you came from. And read Matthew 6:25-34, especially 33 and 34. May God bless you and show favor on your life.|`|ciflUY2Oaa	I would if I thought they would help me get the job I want.  We can't hide from our past.

It's harder than it sounds to actually sit infront of your computer for up to 6 hours a day and just work. It sounds easy enough until you sit down to do it. The hardest thing I always find is just focusing. So listening to the radio or music helps but then you're being less productive with what you're doing. And when you're not actually in an office room it's even harder. I've never really found the work I do hard just putting in the time.  For me if I can't focus it's the difference between making $50 that day and making a few hundred. So there's usually bad days and really good days.

You could try to convince a court that your version of the contract is correct but, without a written contract, it will be your word against the client.  Fortunately, there’s an easy way to avoid these problems: Always get your agreements in writing. <br>  <br>  Using written contracts will help you prevent misunderstandings, clearly define the expectations you and the client have about the job, and prove your case in court, should it come to that.<br>  
mDnKPmibaa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having. I give you my word that they pay.|`|pJEuPvYIaa	<a href="http://www.teddypgray.com/kagrayson" rel="nofollow">http://www.teddypgray.com/kagrayson</a><br>  <br>  The biggest risk in life is not taking one!

Uqk6zbWPaa	Hi There~<br>  I would say the final out come of your set up depends greatly on the type of meeting being held~ <br>  For example~ <br>  When I have home meetings I do more of a casual setting with the important tools ( dvd, dry erase board, etc.) in the front of the room and ready to go~ I always have some sort of background music that is easy going, something soothing~ I also have light finger foods and drink that I plan ahead to serve at the end~ This way, it gives me a chance to really wrap up the meeting and also have an excuse to get to know my people, answer questions, and "close the deal"~ Rather then ending a meeting and then everyone shuffle out the door~   For a hotel/formal meeting I use the same structure but things change like attire, and set up~  I always do the music, I have a mic, maybe a projector/laptop for a bigger crowd, water to drink in the back right of the room, and tools, info, or anything significant in the back left~ I always put a table outside ot the room to with a few clip boards for the people to sign in their name, email, and phone #'s as a way to keep in touch, to get feed back, to build repport, and network further~ If it is product based I always try to do something special like make a gift basket around the product that is being presented and then when they sign up, they would also get a raffle ticket for the basket at the end of the meeting~ I also bring a cake with something significant to the meeting~ Again to be able to network~ I would recommend being ready to go at least 2 hrs before~ Make sure you have plenty of business cards if appropriate or at least a sure way for people to be able to contact you~ Make sure you have less chairs then you anticipate people, to add the appearance of a full house~ Just make sure you have chairs on the sides of the room ready and available~ If you want, you can make a flyer with all the important info like websites, emails, ect. and place them on the chairs before hand~ Name tags are a must to know who is who~ Keep the room a few degrees cooler  then normal to keep people alert~ Last but not least, try to keep the meeting or presentaion about an hour long~ That is the best amount of time that people stay focused and listen, anything longer and you will lose your crowd~ I hope this helps out a bit, let me know if you need any help, advice, or creative ideas~ <br>  May God Lead You To Your Destiny~<br>  <br>  Warmest Regards~<br>  Issy<br>  PS- I recommend holding all questions until after the meeting has ended~ This is the perfect cake talk~ Reason being is you might have that one person who thinks they "know" more then you or have something negative to say that will ask that one question and that could be the kiss of death in the meeting~|`|449bdf579d607542b6c95e4796c9cc77aa	It depends on the purpose of the meeting and the needs of the participants.  For a larger conference, I would have a registration table outsideof the main room to greet the attendees.  If the speaker needs any a/v equipment, be sure they are available and in working order by testing them prior to the meeting.  Have your hand out materials at each place setting or at the registration table.<br>  <br>  All meetings are different and have different needs.  Will there be food or beverages?  Is it casual or formal?
yV3ff0z2aa	I am going to assume you are not in a position of leadership, where it is expected that you give feedback, but rather in one where you are with equals, and thus in an awkward pickle.<br>  <br>  In that case, I would start engaging your co-workers in lucnhroom conversation, ask them what they like best about the job, what is easiest for them. Begin going to them for advice when you need help in that subject area, and they will begin to see you as non-threatening. Then you can allow yourself to become an expert in your own sub-area, allowing you to more efficiently exchange answers and feedback. If you do not have a good realtionship with your co-workers, just forget it, they are going to take any suggestion as hostile, a threat to their job, which they will protect above all. However, if you have a good realtionship, you can first allow them to focus on their strengths, thus creating the comfort they need to reveal their weaknesses, and to accept and provide feedback.|`|kzh32Sl6aa	As long as it's your job to do that and that there would be no resentment flying around if you  decided to take this role.

7pKtkoMbaa	Be straightforward.  Forget the dramatics.  Turn off your defensiveness.  Develop a HOT (honest, open & trusting) personality.  Be considerate of feelings.  There is no need to be unpleasant.  Maintain the highest possible standards for yourself and see everyone as an equal.  Join Toastmasters International to learn to communicate to groups.  Master that and you will have no problem communicating your thoughts and feelings.  Write your life story.  Reflection will make you wiser.  Just don't become a know-it-all.  There is a fine line.

gAdU4MVOaa	il problema che affligge le borse sono i derivati costruiti sui mutui a rischio. Se uno non paga le rate del mutuo perde la casa. Punto. Quello che invece è successo è che le banche appena stipulato il mutuo lo hanno impacchettato in una obbligazione e poi rivenduto (abbellito da un'agenzia di rating con giudizi favorevoli) a tutto il mondo. Sino a pochi giorni fa si diceva che non vi erano pericoli per l'Europa ma la settimana scorsa è venuto fuori che BNP PARIBAS (francese) ha bloccato i riscatti su 3 suoi fondi per evitare ulteriori perdite. E in seguito in Europa si è scoperto che molti potrebbero avere in portafoglio questi strumenti. Insomma i comportamenti "delinquenziali" delle banche (alcune hanno inserito i derivati sui mutui in fondi monetari!!) stanno creando un grosso problema. Vedremo.. intanto in settimana la BCE e la FED sono dovute intervenire immettendo liquidità nel sistema... il rischio è il cosiddetto "credit crunch" ovvero la crisi del mercato del credito che a questo punto potrebbe contagiare tutto il mondo che significa che nessuno vuole più prestare denaro (intendo tra banche ed istituzioni finanziarie e ad imprese di grossa dimensione) se non a tassi molto elevati.

IyphEvYsaa	Opt for a debt consolidation loan: The easiest method of getting a debt consolidation loan is to utilize the equity of your home. Equity of your home is calculated and determined by the difference in the amount you have paid and the amount you owe. If the amount you have paid is more than the amount due, you can use it as collateral. This allows you to borrow money on lower interest rates. Besides, you also get tax benefit on this type of loan. Consult your tax advisor before opting for this loan.|`|Z5iQJ7iXaa	eloan is good and here are some more...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://loanconsolidationsite.googlepages.com/home" rel="nofollow">http://loanconsolidationsite.googlepages...</a>|`|H94druDZaa	Talk to a bank or other financial institution about taking out a loan.

AA12094998	you should try to get some money down - it is possble to down your down by doing a cash back at purchase - basically you would buy an 82,000 hours for 85000 with 3000 back at signing - which means that the loan is for 85000 but you would never have to come up with the 3000 because the buyer is taking it off at the sale date - this is legal in some states but not all - with no down and bad credit your interest will be unreasonably high - io reccommend you save what you can even if you put $500 into a CD - it will be $800 in like 1 year if you do it right!!!|`|3Ol7aut2aa	You may have a couple options from FHA to My Community Loans.

e8jw0mttaa	If you have money available, you should put the maximum amount into both your 401(k) and your Roth or Traditional IRA. If your employer adds any matching funds to your 401(k), you should contribute fully to your 401(k) before thinking about the IRA. The matching funds are usually a percentage of what you contribute, and it's like getting free money. <br>  <br>  After you max out the 401(k), if you want to set even more money aside for retirement, you should choose either a Roth or Traditional IRA. Presently, you can contribute up to $4000 a year ($5000 if you are 50 or older). If you're in a low tax bracket right now, most likely choosing a Roth IRA is better. You will be taxed on the contribution now, but not when you receive distributions from it after you retire. Depending on your income, you may be able to receive a tax deduction for contributing to a Traditional IRA, but distributions of a Traditional IRA are taxed. Choosing one or the other depends upon your unique finanical situation.|`|5574a09cda70e1c7bbb5303d4899415aaa	A Roth is a good deal.

England however requires that all the lights be switched around and different colored lights replace the existing lights on our cars, not to mention an extra "loading" tax that they pass on to Americans importing their cars into their country, and finally they require "Emissions Standards" testing which most US cars fail -- even though a LOT of crappy old British cars are active on the streets of "Great" Britain belching out smog all over the place -- the whole place is one big giant race track. The taxes they levy are especially designed for their military visitors from America -- CHA-CHING !!! Or how about Japan, where they have not only "special loading" charges on insurance policies through AIG to help foster more money coming from our troops overseas to a special Japanese Compulsory Insurance (JCI) only for certain prefectures -- especially ones our troops live in, which costs about $1000 per year ( or more in most cases ).  Kinda slows our automakers down which in turn affects US jobs...<br>  <br>  NAFTA works great...for other countries...Get the picture ?

I also went to Consumer Credit Counseling and they were able to offer me a plan to to get out of debt in 3 years but with a much larger monthly payment which anyone can do by paying more on the principal. I am about to go through creditsolutions.com but have read a few things on bbb.com( better business bureau) and filing sounds like a better route. So my advise is be very careful and contact the bbb before going with any company and make sure they fully explain their program before you pay. If they dont offer to explain how your bills will be paid, how soon and how they negotiate then they are probably like LONE STAR. The debt industry is full of crooked companies, its like swimming with sharks. Good Luck!|`|3FRhc8fsaa	Debt consolidation IS an option, and you should look into it.

Segundo Maslow, "essas necessidades est?o ligadas entre si numa escala de valores ascendente que, quando satisfeitas, surtem no indivíduo uma grande sensa??o de bem estar".<br>  <br>      Mas por que é necessário estar motivado? Segundo teóricos motivacionais, o homem que vive em sociedade precisa e depende de outras pessoas para sobreviver, o que gera nele um conjunto de necessidades. Ou seja, quanto mais motivado estiver o grupo de convívio, planejando caminhos e tra?ando metas para o desenvolvimento próprio ou da empresa, mais motivadas ficar?o as pessoas que trabalham diretamente com esse grupo. Motiva??o chama motiva??o.<br>  <br>      A realiza??o de uma atividade na qual o Profissional gosta é um dos caminhos para esse sucesso interior. Há muito, acreditava-se que trabalho e felicidade eram coisas incompatíveis. Hoje, especialistas no assunto afirmam que quando as pessoas fazem as atividades que gostam elas s?o mais felizes e trabalham mais motivadas, o que resulta em autoconhecimento, melhoria da qualidade de vida e dos servi?os e aumento da produtividade.<br>  <br>      O ambiente em que vivemos interfere na motiva??o, pois é através dele que se torna possível satisfazer grandes necessidades. Porém é importante compreender que, o desenvolvimento de atitudes positivas, a melhora da auto-estima, autoconhecimento, controle de sentimentos e emo??es, o cuidado com o corpo, o desenvolvimento de relacionamentos motivadores, assumir responsabilidades, procurar solucionar problemas, definir prioridades, planejar, atingir metas e objetivos, aceitar desafios, ter iniciativa, ser otimista e estar aberto a mudan?as, s?o grandes passos para uma vida motivada e valorizada que, segundo especialistas, pode ser a chave do sucesso.|`|dRtNBW87aa	Inteligencia; amor ao proximo; saber lidar com stress; saber gerir equipes; ser pressistente; agressivo(no bom sentido); saber gerir gastos.<br>  <br>  Eu vejo pelo meu marido que ja abriu varias filiais da multinacional onde trabalha e sempre teve sucesso.|`|ef54a3db456fd854f4c553753c679f6daa	Fazer Perguntas e Responder perguntas no Yahoo!

AA12251404	Write "Two weeks notice for current employer."<br>  <br>  By doing this you will show yourself as a responsible individual.  Good employers do not want to hire someone that treats their former employer badly.  If they try to push you to come without the 2 week notice, you can known that they will push you to do things that are not right.<br>  <br>  An employer does not want to hire someone that speaks badly about a former job either.  They know you will not be there forever, so they do not want to hire someone that shows that they will make an old employer look badly.  <br>  <br>  Whether you call it the Golden Rule, or Bad Karma, it is true.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA12169920	Well then just answer honestly. Unless you're willing to walk out on your current employer, you won't be available for two weeks, or what ever. A good way to do it is to write in the actual date that you could be available.<br>  <br>  Often employers will run people off immediately, rather than have them goofing around for two weeks, stealing pencils and whatever else isn't nailed down. Watch out.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	say something like 2 weeks after date of hire........|`|odz6pUcIaa	I was working for a Corporate Taco Bell and decided to switch to a Franchise TB simply because they pay more.

It may also say in your contract. If it says i.e. 1 month put 1 month on the application form
BjPWJ69laa	If you're a college student, you can try looking for job placement programs available on campus. Always inquire in-person if a place is hiring, it's a waste of time to fill in an application if a certain place won't be hiring for another six months to a year. If you live in California, there may be developing areas around your city that are building new businesses, offices, and fast-food places. Go walk around a mall and see if a store is "coming soon", and try applying for that particular store. Just keep a look out for new openings and stuff!|`|6d08a4180b9ee9bdf1db85f96aaeed92aa	Don't wait for them to call you, because they won't! Call them after 3 days and request an interview. That way you can get your foot in, and give a good impression. Even if they aren't hiring at the time, they'll keep your resume and application at the top of their list for when they do hire. <br>  <br>  Also, look online to see if they actually are hiring. Most corporate websites like Target and Walmart have listings for a specific store with descriptions, etc.|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	They are all retail places, how about trying an office job?  I take it you are in the US but I'm sure you have an equivalent to our (UK) job centres and employment agencies so maybe you should try some of these rather than going to the companies directly

If the admin aspects cover all the smooth running of inter-departmental communications (inc. supplies) Liaison Manager might be suitable for both both internal and external purposes.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	no.  if you're in charge of the receptionist and the administrative assistant then yes, that would be Admin manager.  If you are in charge of those 2 people.<br>  <br>  If you are the receptionist with administrative duties - then you are called an administrative assistant.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes- if you're in charge of other people then you'd be the manager.  If you just perform receptionist/admin duties - then you would be considered admin asst/office administrator
1mbO4UYiaa	Admin Manager or Office Manager are both suitable titles for that job.<br>  <br>  You never mentioned if this was your job or if you were looking to hire?  If you are looking for a MANAGER - then of course salary expectations go up (and if you are looking to pay less for a person then don't use the word Manager) LOL<br>  <br>  If...... however, it is for your CV as your JOB TITLE - then I'd go with something along those lines as are comensurate with your responsibilities.  <br>  <br>  It's not the title that's important, it is the tasks / duties and results that matter most.  When I was hiring - Titles were unimportant to me - I always looked at skills and experience.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps?|`|NqeZ0ggHaa	How about office manager or receptionist.|`|46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	If you are in charge of reception you are an front of house manager if you are in charge of admin work in an office you would be an office manager.|`|AA11220909	(Senior) Receptionist or Office Manager|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	I'd go with office manager too.

BSU9pNUWaa	Yes. The buy it now price means you can win/buy the item immediately. Usually there are more than one of the same item available when there is only a buy it now price. In other cases the seller may start the bidding at a low price say, $10.00 but have a But It Now price of $50.00. So you don't want to take your chances bidding or the bidding gets very close to the Buy It Now price, you'll want to take that option to ensure you win.|`|nu65nyxEaa	Yes, exactly. Once you complete the buy it now, the auction ends and the item is yours.|`|AA11747527	yes.  next to it should be the "buy it now" price.  that is the price you can buy the item from them immediately without bidding.  it also means you won't have to wait for the auction to end.

bFeQvooYaa	Go with Chris & find a C.A.B. do not tell them anything.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	Never ever tell these people any personal details about your income or how your money is spent, as soon as you do they will start lecturing you on how you should be spending YOUR money. They want to know this so they can put it into there computer and give you a figure. But these computers don't take into account your personal expenses. So ignore any requests for personal information, it's there job to find it out not your to give it to them. <br>  <br>  Once you know how much you can realistically afford to pay them, make sure you make all offers in writing sent recorded. Don't deal with these people over the phone. They legally have to accept any reasonable offers you make, even if it's ￡1 a month, if that's all you can afford that is all they can ask for. If they won't accept your offer, don't pay them more to shut them up. Ignore them and they will soon come around with an offer to slash the total down.|`|DVGJWZMyaa	Don't tell them<br>  find a citizens advice bureau.

I wouldn't be surprised it they then try to ge an order for that amount to be paid just to them|`|BZumpQkaaa	Dont tell them anything ever!, the one big thing is offering to repay the amount. As long as you make an offer of payment they can't refuse I would offer ￡10 per month.<br>  I had a ￡2500 debt and was not working I agreed ￡20 a month and they accepted and after some wangling I also got all interest stopped, with no penalties on my credit score, but that doesn't mean you can offer them 20p If they start messing you around let them take you to court, more than likely the judge will throw it out and wipe the debt repay your costs and fine the company.|`|vX19PzzYaa	hi, in english law you cant go bankrupt for less than ￡750.If you are offiout of work, and your debts are unsecured, be honest tell them you are skint and offer them ￡1 per month, they will accept it in the end. if you are really worried, go to your local neighbour hood office they have a debt councillor who will advise you, and even contact your debtors for you ...ps....i know this as i have just done the same over thousands of pounds of debt.....good luck|`|HBr2bvXvaa	You may be in the sh*t because these firms are ruthlesss

They should be locked up to protect normal people, but for mental illness, not criminal behavior.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Technically its not illegal to destroy your own house. If you do the damage before the foreclosure is final, then its not illegal. Once the foreclosure is final then the bank owns the house and it would be vandalism just like if you did it to any house that wasn't yours. <br>  <br>  However, I wouldn't be surprised to see the bank file a lawsuit against people who do this on some sort of charges. The bank can always sue the previous owners to recoup the difference between the sale price at auction and the amount owed on the loan. The more the house is devalued the bigger this gap would get. But I don't know how the bank would collect their settlement considering the fact that if the previous owners had any money they never would have been foreclosed in the first place. |`|DSLlioPcaa	It's illegal and punishable by law. The bank has to sue the previous owner but lawsuit is expensive compared to fixing/repairing the damage. So, the bank may forego the lawsuit and simply fix/repair the problems.<br>  Some people are just horrible. These are the people who are responsible for the current subprime mortgage mess. They could not afford to buy the house to begin with and stop making mortgage payments. When foreclosed, trash the house to vent their anger. I wish there was a  forum either on internet or open media to list out the names and faces of these people who commit misdemeaner crimes and get away with it.|`|d07683f385c8c5d34bcf9ca4a532395faa	How could you prove that someone did this intentionally and didn't live that way for years.  That's where the problem is and it's not worth the time and money of dealing with you must banks don't.<br>  <br>  I think it's childish for someone to do that to the home they were buying they act like idiots because THEY weren't able to pay THEIR mortgage.|`|23SkYEw5aa	It is illegal.  It's clearly written in the mortgage that the borrower will maintain the property.<br>  <br>  The mortgage company should go after these people with the full force of the law.  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	Besides it being completely immature and selfish, the mortgage company could, if they choose to, file criminal charges for destruction of property not belonging to them.|`|DD3Cks62aa	That is actually not illegal.<br>  <br>  That is becoming more and more common these days, people are retaliating by damaging the property. It is part of the risk of buying a foreclosed property.<br>  <br>  It even has a name "Foreclosure Parties" .... I've seen properties that the previous owners tear it up down to the studs and take all of the copper and wires that they could.<br>  <br>  |`|oWLe7TNIaa	Unfortunatley no, it is not illegal.  People are cruel and they somehow blame the bank for their stupid decisions or bad luck.  I work in the mortgage industry and have denied several loans for foreclosed properties because they were completely destroyed- carpeting torn up, ceilings ripped off, windows broken, appliances and faucets taken out... so much so that we couldn't even lend on them.<br>  <br>  It's amazing how so many people lack a conscience.  If, God forbid, I was ever foreclosed on, I would leave peacefully.  In no way is it the bank's fault that you couldn't pay... and you're only costing the bank more money.<br>  <br>  I really wish that the lenders who foreclose had more legal ability to go after these types of people.|`|EHWsPsmxaa	If you do not have the title/deed to a home it is not your home.

mDnKPmibaa	<a href="http://cashcratereview.com" rel="nofollow">http://cashcratereview.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address.

Even if a high street printer can't do it, s/he will probably know who can.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the link below and don't be put off by the term "vanity publishing". It means the same as self-publishing.<br>  <br>  I do know it's going to cost you, because the vast majority of the cost of any publishing project is setting it up. The copies themselves don't cost much to produce. You must be a really great friend!

I would recommend you find people who have left each company and ask them what their experiences are. Folks who are still with an organization tend to have a biased opinion, generally, and "drink the kool-aid", so to speak. You might also try doing a search on the company plus terms like "sucks" or "scam" to get the bad with the good.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|5BdpRfCJaa	get your doubt about Insurance program procedure solved here <a href="http://theinsurancegroup.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://theinsurancegroup.blogspot.com</a>

7rKUmK0qaa	First you have to take associate degree in nursing or bachelors to become an RN. Once you pass your nclex and get your license, you usually become an L&D nurse through experience. Some hospitals may offer special classes or certification for L&D but mostly its through experience. Get hired by the hospital first. New grad usually start off on med surg floors. But after working there for awhile you can ask to be transferred to L&D. They usually give you orientation before you work on L&D. Like i said some hospitals have special classes for L&D and some dont. You become an L&D nurse if you work on L&D for a quite sometime but you are required to be educated in neonatal resuscitation and fetal monitoring.<br>  You usually obtain this through the hospital where you work.<br>  Goodluck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You have to take the prerequisites first such as general anatomy and human physiology.

AA11284831	The cheapest way by far from a tax perspective would be for him to leave it to you in his will.  The Gift Tax is higher than the Estate Tax because of different exclusion amounts.  <br>  <br>  If he gives it to you before he dies, your basis is whatever he originally paid for it.  That could lead to HUGE capital gains taxes for you when you sell.  If he wills it to you, your basis is the stepped up basis on the date of his death.  If you then immediately sold it for that value you'd pay no capital gains tax at all.<br>  <br>  To simplify probate he may wish to consider putting it in trust for you.  That won't avoid Estate Tax but it will expedite the transfer of the property to you upon his death.<br>  <br>  When considering a transfer of property of significant value you should ALWAYS consult with both an attorney and a tax pro for guidance up front.<br>  <br>  Probably the WORST thing that he could do would be to just quitclaim it to anyone without getting professional advice first.  That could be a VERY expensive mistake.<br>  <br>  I've been working on one where an elderly woman gave her dope-fiend son her multi-million dollar home.  He sold it and snorted most of the proceeds up his nose.  She owed the IRS a small fortune in Gift Taxes and he owed a small fortune in capital gains taxes.  They USED to live in a big fancy house.

It sounds like one of those credit protection companies where they guarantee that no one can steal your credit / id theft.  That is the lock they put on.

bf420b0aeac394f3c7221fd12f9c7ebbaa	If the card was issued by the bank where your account is, you probably agreed to "cross-colateralization" which means than any assets you have in the bank can be taken to satisfy any obligation to the bank.  No judgment required.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, once a creditor has a judgment and you have been given a reasonable amount of time to pay, and haven't paid, then they can go back to the judge for help collecting.  This means that they can get an order garnishing your wages and putting a lien on your house.  They can also attach you bank accounts.  This doesn't mean putting a lien on it.  This means that the judge orders the bank to make payment on your behalf and the creditor walks in with the court order and withdraws the money.  (OK, maybe not walks in, it's probably done by mail and the bank sends them a check and clears out your account but it adds up to the same thing.)  Disobeying a court order is a serious thing.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Creditors will not "lien" bank accounts;  they will garnish them.  All it takes is a court judgment.|`|sUSfQ9AZaa	Yes they can!

xoqQbHi1aa	Please do not consolidate. It is not free, they will lower your payments by increasing the length of time until you are debt free, and you will take a hit on your credit score. There is a better way.<br>  <br>  A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want.<br>  <br>  B.Get a temporary part time job, if you have one, get another. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you:<br>  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.<br>  <br>  2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.<br>  <br>  3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt #1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt #2. That will pay debt #2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card #3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:<br>  <br>  To start :<br>  Debt #1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment<br>  Debt #2 (middle interest): minimum payment<br>  Debt #3(lowest interest): minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: minimum payment from Debt #1+ Minimum payment from Debt #2 +extra payment<br>  Debt #3: minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: paid off<br>  Debt #3:Mimimum payment from card #1+ minimum payment from Debt #2+ minimum payment from Debt #3+ extra payment.<br>  <br>  That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.<br>  <br>  4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.<br>  <br>  5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.<br>  <br>  5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.<br>  <br>  5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.<br>  <br>  You can do it and it isn't as hard as you think. Just follow the plan

Small business owners like to use other small business owners.<br>  <br>  Make sure you let everyone you know that you are in business and looking for clients. Ask them if they know of any place they could put a flier like their break room at work or their church. Don't be shy people love to help.<br>  <br>  Post your information on craigslist.org and repost it regularly to move it back to the top of the list. <br>  <br>  I suggest starting a free myspace page for your business (since you don't really want a page yet) you can then get everyone you know to friend the business and you never know which of their friends will see it and use you.

Get stickers made with your company name, we fix computers, and a phone number (as large as possible for ease of reading). The average wrapped vehicle gets 300 brand impressions per mile!<br>  <br>  Go to as many of the free events in your area as possible. Shows, reading, seminars, movies in the park, what ever... and talk to people! <br>  For example I went to a free small business seminar hosted by the small business association on Saturday. Not only did I learn a lot but when the other people in attendance got to talking they realized they could hire each other and every one ended up passing around a paper to list their contact info and business description.

If there is nothing written in the agreement authorizing them to withdraw that amount, call them and then follow up with a registered letter. If you don't get a favorable response and your money back, take your documentation to an attorney. If you have reason to sue an attorney will take the case and not charge you, he/she will take their fee out of the 30% they get if you win the case.

What her duties are concerning keeping the area clean and tidy, whether you set times she's not allowed to be there, early early mornings or late evenings for example. If your gonna charge her rent, set out how much, and what date it should be paid on. If your not going to charge rent, charge her a small fee for the upkeep of the area, horses can cause a lot of damage so make sure you take pictures of the area before she puts them on in case of serious damage to the property.<br>  <br>  Simple things like this should be set out beforehand and make sure you get a signature from both sides.

3HAqPHZTaa	The fact that you're submitting a resume instead of just an application is beyond what's usually required to work in a shop like those you've described.  Adding a cover letter seems to me like an excellent way to personalize you resume and gear it toward the business to which you're applying.  I'm sure the employers will be impressed with the effort you put into this endeavor, especially with the cover letters.  The references may be unnecessary at this point.  Usually, one writes "references available upon request" at the bottom of their resume.  Also, make sure your cover letters highlight some of the things that you like about the company.   <br>  <br>  Oh, and don't get discouraged if they don't hire you.  Remember that right now people can't afford to hire new people (for the most part), and some have had to let go of the employees they already had.

nmozvlGPaa	Impossible to say from the information you've provided.<br>  <br>  A mortgage payment is made up of up to 5 items: (1) principal, (2) interest, (3) taxes, and (4) homeowners insurance and (5) private mortgage insurance.  As another answer mentioned, the first two are easy to calculate if you know the loan amount, term and interest rate.  Then the others are added to give a final total payment.  Real estate taxes, and both insurances are very variable.  I have seen real estate taxes vary from 0.5% to 4.5% of the value depending on location.<br>  <br>  When you talk to the broker the papers will quote an interest rate and an APR.  The APR will be slightly higher because it'll include some up-front costs. Your credit is suspect and you will not qualify for the best rates (near 5%).  Expect yours to be closer to 6%<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Impossible to say from the information you've provided.<br>  <br>  A mortgage usually is made up of 4 items: (1) principle, (2) interest, (3) taxes, and (4). It's easy enough to calculate the payments on the first two. You can go any lots of online sites, plug in the amount borrowed and length of the mortgage and see what the interest rate is.<br>  <br>  But in this case, you haven't told us what the length of the loan is. 15 years? 30 years? You haven't told us how much the taxes are. $800? $1,600? You haven't told us how much the insurance is. And you haven't told us whether there are any "points" with the loan. A point is an upfront cash payment of 1% of the loan amount. You also haven't told us how much you're putting down. All of that affects the interest rate.<br>  <br>  When you go in, they'll hand you some papers. One will quote an interest rate. The other will have an APR figure. (The APR figure will be slightly higher because it'll include some up-front costs.) The numbers should be around 4.75%-5.0%. That's what a good interest rate for a well-qualified buyer is today. Use that as your guide, rather than trying to work backward.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	What's the interest rate?

AA12279950	Totally true.  Holiday is allocated pro rata (usually but this would depend on your contract of course).  So - assuming you get 25 days holiday per year, that would be 2.08 days per month.  So if your holiday entitlement starts in January (again, check your contract) you're only entitled to 10 days by the end of May.  If you take more than this they can deduct the money from your final pay cheque.|`|1mbO4UYiaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Yes it is true that you allowed so many days holiday from the beginning of your companies year.

The rate of return from investing in your own knowledge and skills will be much higher than anything you’ll see from stocks, real estate, or other investments.<br>   <br>  In some cases you can even measure the rate of return. Say you buy a book. Even add in the cost of your average hourly rate multiplied by the time it took you to read it. Many books will be lousy. But every once in a while, you’ll get one good idea that gives you a huge rate of return. Like 10x the cost in a matter of months. This is especially true with business and personal productivity books. <br>   <br>  But often it isn’t a breakthrough idea but rather the continuous exposure to the same ideas presented in different ways that produces a steady return over time. And the results go way beyond monetary. If investing in your own knowledge finally gives you the idea you need to quit smoking, you can measure the lifetime financial savings in the cost of cigarettes, but what is the increased level of health worth to you? What is the idea that allows you to meet and connect with your future spouse worth? What is shedding 50 pounds of fat and knowing you can keep it off the rest of your life worth? What is building a career that totally fulfills you worth?<br>   <br>  A trick I learned from Brian Tracy is to invest 3% of your income on your own personal development. I don’t know why he specifically uses 3%, but that seems about right to me. So if you earn $5000 per month, you’d invest just $150 per month on your own personal development. You could buy about 10 paperback business or self-help books; those are typically $12-16 each (but that’s a lot to read in a month). Or you could order about 3 six-cassette or six-CD audio programs; those are usually around $50-60 each, often $20-30 if you buy them used. Or that $150 could go toward the cost of a seminar or conference.
yQv8W0gDaa	Good question.  The banks were bailed out because technically quite a few are insolvent right now, due to something called "mark to market" accounting.  Basically real estate needs to be written down to it's current market value, which throws many banks out of compliance with capital requirements to operate as a bank.  The only way they can bring their capital back up to compliance levels is to infuse new money, which was supposed to be the basis of the bailout.  It's a mess no matter how you look at it.<br>  <br>  Personally I think in most cases we should just let the bank fail - that's what America is all about.  Are we captialists or are we turning communist?  <br>  <br>  John<br>  <a href="http://www.invest.us" rel="nofollow">http://www.invest.us</a>|`|CLHhhU5waa	it's all so funny. as if the banks need bailing out. the banks are getting bailed out because the banks run the government, and they want their piece of the pie, as always.

If he want provide them, give the council a ring, state that you have asked the agent for the landlords details but they won't get back to you. The council should be able to get the information from the agent themselves if you give them the agents details. If that gets you no where, you might want to seek professional advice from the CAB, who will write to the agent themselves. But be quick, if you don't give the council all the details they need by the date set, they will cancel your claim and you will ahev to start again!|`|ARAYm7BLaa	you'll just have to keep asking for the address - you wont be the only one...the benefits office is trying to check whether the landlord lives with you or not...keep trying|`|d89416ed0e27a36978e0ba1cb1b5608eaa	If you are in an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, your agent is legally required to provide your landlord's details - do you still have a copy of your agreement, as the name and address should be on there - it's not legal if it isn't. Just beware, the agent and landlord don't have to accept the housing benefit and can issue you with a Section 21, as the benefit can be cut off at anytime, so it is not a guaranteed form of income. <br>  <br>  Riley.|`|cdaedf9f007c1ba212c680132983233caa	By law you are entitled to know the full name and address of the person that you rent from regardless of whether they use an agent or not to manage the property. As this will impact on your financial circumstances I would recommend that you visit Citizen's Advise immediately for assistance. If the agent is withholding the information from you then they are breaking the law and your statuary rights. If they don't have the details then they are negligent.|`|ebae2bb97120c05a8385c8a1fc06cefbaa	Birdie is correct, you are entitled by law to have the landlords address with-in 21 days of a written request, under the requirements of section 48 of the Landlord & Tenant Act 1987.|`|Hae8acnpaa	Your tenancy agreement should include full details for y our landlord even if the property is managed by an agent.

L4rlu2BDaa	Why did you choose symantec to sort your computer problem rather then your computer manufacter? If you have a dell PC, you should have contacted dell about the problem rather then a virus/security company. They would have no idea how to get you online, they just provide anti-virus programs and have nothing to do with computers themselves. Dell, HP, or who ever made your PC would be your first choice when having a problem. Most will provide technical support over the phone, where you only pay for the call and not the actual information.<br>  <br>  I have found the contact details on the symantec company, write to the office nearest to you and complain direct to your countries head office.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.symantec.com/about/profile/contact.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.symantec.com/about/profile/co...</a>|`|uTA2TLC6aa	If you paid by plastic, have words with the card company; you may well be able to have the transaction charged back as in effect, faulty goods.|`|AA11908567	Try trading standards.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Find the address on your pay slip. Write a letter explaining what has happened. Keep a copy of the letter for a file you just started. Keep sending letters where they have to sign for them, return receipt requested, or registered letters. That way they can not say they didn't get them. Don't take no for an answer. Say you will run an add in the paper about what they did to you. Then do it. Keep after them. This is not fair.

QIwhMrBraa	as someone who has had to go through piles of CV's myself, and its a pain in the a*se and u run out of patience quickly and after the tenth sloppy one you start to just bin them, i would paper clip them, because if they  have a messy desk, and they will, full of CV's, then they arent gonna want to have to look for page 2 if it drops out, are they. paper clip or staple. keep it all together, make your contact details crystal clear as well. put a footer on each page with your name and which page it is as well. make it EASY for them, this will convey that if you are hired you will make their life easy, not a mess.|`|CEoCe9ENaa	Having dealt with more CVs than I can count during my working days my suggestion is to staple the two sheets together, and then add your letter with a paperclip.  If you put it into a folder, the prospective employer will probably take it apart anyway!   Good luck|`|sAwmwynnaa	Ensure you write on only one side of the paper, don't reduce the font size to make it hard to read. Try bullet pointing and add a brief description of each main topic - once you're done, staple the pages together.<br>  <br>  The CV should at least be tailored to the job you're applying for, so while you may have a 'catch all' cv, ensure you edit out things that aren't appliciable.|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	My CV has 3 pages and I just staple them together
PDotv2Hsaa	You need to continue to pay the minimum sum each month. In fact try to pay a little more than this each month if you can. Also remember to pay on time so that no late charges are levied. <br>  <br>  If things are really dire and you cannot make these payments, speak with the bank personally to discuss a debt management plan. Don't default on your payments. <br>  <br>  Of course all this goes into your credit history. It will affect your future credit card applications, bank loans etc. Incidentally, if you want to find out what your credit history looks like, you can request it at Singapore's Credit Bureau: <a href="http://www.creditbureau.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.creditbureau.com.sg/</a>|`|CLHhhU5waa	they'll get to you, don't worry. you will never be safe, so just get rid of that notion right now.
AA12251404	I appreciate your interest in getting a job while you are still in school.  With the economy in a downturn right now, your selection may be limited.  Many employers will choose to hire an adult that has a family to take care of, so do not get discouraged if it takes a while to find a position.<br>  <br>  At age fifteen you can offer enthusiasm and energy, politeness and a willingness to work.  Most jobs you will qualify for now are in customer service, such as a restaurant or store (including movie theaters).  <br>  <br>  The key now is to make yourself appear to be the best candidate for any job.  Your first impression is very important.  When you go get an application, make sure you are dressed nicely, this is the time to leave stylish jeans full of holes at home.  Make sure your face and hands are clean and your hair is combed.  Because most customers are older than you, your future boss will want to hire someone that dresses well and is clean.  I am always surprised when someone comes to get an application and is a mess.  They do not get hired.<br>  <br>  Consider getting a letter of recomendation from a teacher or someone that has known you for a while.  Getting something like this will show that a person of responsibility thinks well of you.<br>  <br>  As I said before, your choice of jobs may be limited, but I can assure you that if you work hard and are pleasant and friendly at work, people will treat you well, making it a friendly envioronment.  Good Luck!|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	How about working at the cinema?

The key to finding employment at your age is to work at the local level. Talk to friends and family members if they need an extra pair of hands to work. Perhaps you are good with cars and can help change an oil filter. <br>  <br>  The more skills you have, the better your chances of finding something more lucrative.|`|QWqpcGYiaa	business-<br>  <a href="http://hyparoffice.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hyparoffice.com/</a>
