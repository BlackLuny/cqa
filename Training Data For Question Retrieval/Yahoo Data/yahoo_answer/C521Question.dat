20090222163701AAeNJyO	Health;Women's Health	Question to all girls who think they've got a Big Butt in comparison to the rest of your body?	Hey, I know this question sounds a bit silly but hear me out..!   This is something that i've heard quite a few times from other girls whose booty is quite big in comparison to the size of the rest of their bodies.   A lot of them say that having a bubble butt shape makes it feel more comfy and soft when they sit becuase they have more cushion to sit on!   I didn't think this was true before, but now I've been working out more and eating more than I used to, so my butt is a lot more bubbly, sexy and curvy shaped . And now I notice when I sit, it does feel quite cushy and soft. Sort of like better cushioning lol!!   So my question is to anyone who also has a big butt, does your butt also feel quite cushioned and comfortable to sit on? Do you also think there's some truth to this?!!!   Serious answers only lol

For example: say if a girl gets a kiss from her partner who has oral herpes. Then her partner performs oral sex on her. Later, that same girl has problems with her genital area but no outbreaks on her mouth area at all. Does that mean she has both genital and oral herpes but just no symptoms for one? or does that mean she has only one of the viruses?

20090222175729AAT83Uw	Health;Women's Health	Bleeding during sex normal?	So last night I had sex for the first time in about eight months.

I'm due to get my period in a few days so I just thought I had gotten it early and didn't think more of it. But today I haven't bled at all and I'm starting to think it was from the sex.      I'm 19 and lost my virginity when I was 16 and have never bled during sex, other than my first. But I've also always had steady boyfriends and regular sex (a couple times a week) before my eight month dry spell so I'm wondering, is it possible for a hymen to grow back?   Or is there another reason I would have bled?

20090222180233AABuc3l	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do i tell if my girlfriend is still bulimic?	My girlfriend has had bulimia for a couple of years now, and i assured her that i would get her through this. She is not a typical bulimic, she doesn't binge and purge, she is a vegetarian, and has a very strict diet, but whenever she breaks that diet, she feels the need to throw up. I am going to marry this girl, and i love her more than anything in the world. My number one policy is always be honest, and i got her down to throwing up 3 times a week as apposed to 2-4 times a day. When she was no longer progressing, and she was stuck at the 3 times a week i started crying, and my tears would never stop flowing. when she saw this, she swore to never throw up again. Now i am a very paranoid person, and i used to have an addiction myself, and i always thought that she was throwing up behind my back, but she said she wasn't, so life went on. A week later she told she had never stopped, and that she was sorry. So i was sad for a while, and i helped her out, and she swore to always be honest with me, and that she would never lie to me ever again. so we worked on her problem for about 4 months now, and i told her to tell me every single time she throws up, so shes been good about this, and she tells me when she throws up, and i mark it on a calender. She has swollen salivary glands, and swollen cheeks. So my question is......how do i tell if shes still bulimic???

I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

Someone told me that marijuana comes in a bottle with your name on it.  I know for pills they do but for weed I never heard of it coming into a bottle.  Marijuana is green plants or whatever.  When a doctor prescribes weed to someone, I’m curious to know how they use the weed. Do they smoke it? What are the symptoms of weed in general? What are the negative affects of it? What are the positive affects? The only positive affects I know is that it relaxes a person.      I also have a question about the drug, PCP.  As I understand, PCP is a drug makes the user feel absolutely no pain because there is no pain threshold whatsoever.  Here are my questions about PCP:      1.) If a person who’s on PCP gets run over by a car, he won’t feel the pain.  Is that correct? Will he feel the pain after he’s off PCP?      2.) If someone gets shot with a gun while on PCP, will he feel that? If he gets shot, will there still be a gunshot wound on him even though he’s n PCP?      Other questions:      3.) I know “weed” is just a street name for marijuana.       4.) What are some other street names for marijuana?       5.) How many different ways is marijuana used? Is it only used by smoking it?      6.) What are street names for heroin?       7.) Does heroin work similar to PCP? A user who uses heroin isn’t supposed to feel any pain or much pain. Is that correct? Does heroin have any pain threshold?      8.) What are the street names for crack cocaine? Can crack only be used by shooting it or snorting it? Are there any other ways to use it?      9.) Is crystal meth different from crack cocaine?      10.) What are street names for speed? Is speed better than meth? Does meth just eat out your brain and speed is only temporary?       11.) How many kinds of meth are there? can u list them?      If anyone wants, can u provide ur yahoo ID or email address because incase I have other questions, I’d like to ask them.  I’m not a drug expert lol…….i’m just trying to get a little bit better understanding of them, that’s why I ask these questions.

She brought up the fact that she thinks I shouldn't even work because I have a heart arrhythmia and should draw disability instead. Is it even possible for a 19 year old to do this? I thought it was for people in an older age group? Yes, I do have a heart arrhythmia and it has prevented me from doing a lot of things. I couldn't participate in gym if it required a lot of running, I get stressed easily and it makes my heart beats skip. I would much rather have a job, but if I can't because of this then how would I go about getting disability? Would a heart arrhythmia even be sever enough to get disability?

20090222230031AAdphPm	Health;Mental Health	How can i get over the temptation to starve myself again?	i am a 15 year old female. i'm almost 5'6, and i weigh 137 pounds. i exercise most days, and i eat pretty well. i typically avoid junk food, and i never drink soda or eat meat. i'm healthy, and i know i should be happy, but it's really hard.      ive been called fat by a lot of guys. and when i'm browsing questions on here, the majority of guys seem to think anything over 120 is fat. i've wanted to lose weight when i was as young as 6, mainly because of my mom and dad. when i was 12, i weighed 120 pounds. my mom tried putting me on a diet because she thought i was overweight.       when i was in 8th and 9th grade, i abused adderall because it took away my appetite. i had under 500 calories every day, and sometimes didn't eat for a few days. it got really bad, and i had to stop taking it because i was passing out all the time.      since then, i've gained it all back and more. i know i'm healthy, but i still hate my body, and i can't stop wanting to starve myself. i don't do it for attention. i've hid it well, so only my best friend knows. what can i do to get over it?       i DON'T want to lose weight, i want to learn to accept my body as it is.   so please don't tell me to take pills.

First, how long does it take lung cancer to.... kill someone? My mother died of lung cancer when I was in the fourth grade I lived with my grandparents(still do)and they chose not to tell me. I had weekend visitation with my father and three weeks before she died he decided that he couldn't do what my grandparents wanted him to do any longer and told me the truth she had been sick a while you could tell by looking at her and i never got to know her and that hurt the most about the last week she was alive she was either sleeping or repeating "Sydney(my name) my sydney i love my sydney" and if they would have told me i could have known her but they didn't how could i find out what year she was diagnosed without my grandparents finding out? i can't talk to them about it i know they didn't kill her but to me they made her die faster and a piece of advice to everyone if anyone is diagnosed with anything serious tell the child

20090222234648AAbpG89	Health;Diet & Fitness	How to lose weight in less than a month?	I'm getting married on March 18 of this year. We kinda just picked the date basically. I got my wedding dress last week and realized I should lose some weight. Especially in the thigh area.   I'm 20 years old, 5'5 and 130-145 pounds. I lose weight quickly, but keep the fat on if that makes sense. Like, one week I could be 130, the next 140 and you would never know it if you saw me. It sucks.    I do walk, but because its in the winter and frickin cold, I lose motivation quickly. (Open the door, feel the cold breeze, slam the door shut and hop into my jammies again and watch Ellen Degeneres...lol)    I would like to lose some weight and NOTICE IT! before march 18. Whats the best way? Other than Crystal Meth and any other form of drugs and starving myself? (Im sorry, its just not my cup of tea.)

I was having great sex with my husband, whips and all, when he did something incredibly strange to me. He was bumping around nice as ever, but suddenly he began to tug at my pubic hairs.      I did not object at first as it was not painful in the beginning, but soon he got more violent and rigorous with it and I could not escape because I was tied down (we get kinky). Anyway, he ended up pulling out almost all of my pubic hair. When he was finished, he plucked what was left over one by one.      He left me there in very much pain for a few hours before coming back and letting me go. I am honestly afraid, but my crotch is in severe agony. I am afraid to talk to my husband. Please help and give me advice on not only how to save my mutilated vag, but also how to approach my husband on the horrible thing he has done.      Cheryl

About 2 weeks ago my little sister had a seizure.( she is 14)  It didnt last long, but we were all scared to death. We went to the ER and they said it was nothing and just to keep an eye on her. Last Thursday she had another seizure. This one was a little worse than the 1st. We took her to the same ER and they basically said the same thing. No tests were done or anything. This is the only ER nearby that insurance will cover.       Well tonight. We were all sitting in the living room talking and my sister stood up to go get her something to drink out of the kitchen. She walked about 2 steps and fell backwards. She wasnt shaking or anything like before but we could not get her to wake up. We thought she was dead. I called her an ambulance while my mom tried to wake her up. The EMTs got there and still couldnt get her awake. Her BP was 129/97, I dont remember the pulse. They put oxygen on her too. This time at the ER they did a CT scan but it was normal, they sent her home. We still do not have answers.      She told me that while she was on the floor, she could hear everything people were saying and she could see everyone but it was like she was looking from above, not on the floor.     Does anyone know what might be going on? We are all so scared for her

20090222233155AAKIkgQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Acne, medication, accutane, etc. Need help!?	Alright guys! I've had it with my blemishes and acne. Sometimes it's okay, and sometimes it's just bad. Especially after shaving. The worst places are on my neck and my forehead and upper-back/shoulders and chest usually. My forehead looks like it's almost scarring and is always drier than any other part of my body, along with my shoulders and upper-back. I wonder how so many young adults my age have a perfectly acne-free, non-drying, scar-free face. It bothers me quite a bit. haha. Anyways, I have a pretty great diet, I drink a lot of water, I take a shower usually every morning, I exercise at least 2 days a week. What's going on here?? I mean, of course it's got a lot to do with genetics and what not, but my life style is pretty healthy. I use acne medications, but I usually test one for about a month or two, and then do nothing and nothing at all has changed, and I sometimes try another after awhile, and still nothing changes. Those chemicals don't work on my skin, so those kinds of treatments are out of the question.... So... what about accutane? my friend was on it, and he is one of the happiest guys, but he was really depressed, but after he was done, he had pretty much no acne. I'm naturally mildly depressed, nothing being active and being around people can't solve. It might worsen that depression and could have long term side affects... I've heard that it comes back wayyy worse after you stop using it, and harms your body, etc, etc. ANYWAYS, after all of that, what would you reccomend? Should I go on accutane? should I try some other type of medication? I'm 19 now, and it's just pathetic that it's never really cleared up. Anyone have a little insight on this? Thanks =)

I am a habitual marijuana smoker (please don't preach to me, I'm looking for honest answers to my question, not a lesson in what I should or shouldn't be doing). I had a drug test for a job, where I wasn't prepared, and didn't know I'd be taking one-       so I had like an hour to get over to the testing lab and pee in a cup, I had smoked about 10 hours before this happened, so I knew I was screwed, drove up to a head shop and grabbed some readi clean. The girl gave me the extra strength stuff for people 250 lbs +. i weigh about 140, so its a bit stronger than needed, drank a gallon and a half of water, and took my drug test an hour later. What do you think my odds are?

This past weekend a bunch of my girlfriends and I had people over before we headed out for the evening.  A friend brought a handle of rum and a few of us tried it. One girl had a few drinks and she couldn't even stand up on her own.  Two others that had just one drink with the rum also "blacked out" and just had one sip of one of their drinks and cannot remember large portions of the night.  Granted everyone was drinking, so it's possible that we just drank too much, but the guy that brought the handle didn't drink any of it which seemed suspicious. Also none of us thought we drank more than our normal limit. So basically what I want to know is if one sip of a spiked drink could have that kind of effect?

The dire news is that I have a problem and I need advice. know this girl who cuts and I am worried about her. She is one of my friends and has been doing so for about 3 years from what shes told me. (I did not know her until about a year ago) Her history is not of the shiniest star either in the sense of what shes been through. I really do not want to tell her parents and would like to pursue that as a last option, its not that her parents are abusive or have problems, its more i feel they will not understand. I have been trying to support her in getting her to stop and I managed to have her clean for a month or so and then a slip up but in any case it was better than before. She was happy for a while and I was showing her there was light at the end of the tunnel. I felt I was making progress with her until just recently she told me that she goes through phases where she cuts multiple times a day, and presently is in one of them. Also recently we got into a big argument over this and she now doesn't want to speak with me at all. I feel as though I have let her down and now cannot help her cope through this. I do not know what to do because I do care and I do not want anything to happen to her. What do you think?

In the winter my hands turn a deep reddish purple.  I dont have to be outside for it to happen, it occurs when im inside too.  My feet do the same thing.  When I was in about 7th grade, I was watching tv one day and noticed that my foot felt funny.  I rubbed it, but that didnt help.  It was a numbing sensation and when I took my sock off my toes were pale white.  Its happened a few other times but only when the weather is cold.  I thought I might have raynaud's  syndrome because all of my symptoms are exactly the same ( cold limbs, purple limbs, sesitive.. etc.) but my fingers didn't turn white so that cant be it.  I also notice that not only do they turn pruple in the cold, but bright red in the heat.  In the shower i have bright red feet and hands and my knees as well.  Also, on my legs appear bright red lines.  They look like maybe they are veins.  When i am cold it is the same but purple lines. Please help

I was given a barium enema (OUCH!). When it came back it said I didn't have that, but I had a complex ovarian cyst on my right ovary measuring 3.5cm. Last week, I went to my doctor who said they would do a sonogram in a month to see if it has grown. I got a copy of the films, and it shows what I think seems like alot of free fluid (ascites?) is there supposed to be any?) I have used this information and done some research on ovarian cysts and the symptoms, but it always seems to go back to ovarian cancer. I am 32 yo. I have no risk factors for ovarian cancer, but I am scared to death. As I sit here now, I just want to cry. Should I get a second opinion on waiting a month, or should I just wait the month and see what happens? I have read so much about OC being misdiagnosed or overlooked until it was too late. I really am at a loss, and would feel better if I could just get some opinions.

My blood test came back negative for herpes so she asked me if i shaved them and I said yeah. She  poked at them and asked if they hurt (they did). She told me to put neosporin on them. How long does it take for herpes to show up in blood tests? How do you stop the pain of infected ingrown hairs? It hurts so bad. They are swollen and they feel hard and are lumped.

I didn't think I had dry sockets, because I followed all directions, but now after some internet searching, I think I may. It said you will usually have a horrid taste in your mouth and horrendous breath-which I've had. I thought all of this was a cold (drainage and not eating real foods) Has anyone else had an experience like this? Also, do I have to go back to my surgeon if it is dry sockets? Can they heal on their own? They're feeling better everyday.

Can I just say that I understand how hard going through not being able to conceive is, but once I did conceive it wasnt a walk in the park. I m sorry for every women out there that wants a baby and has trouble getting pregnant, but in due time you too will experience the pain of pregnancy, the miracle of birth and the rewards of being a mother. So instead of writing nasty remarks back to people that are just asking a question (after all this is what this web site is for Right?) just dont answer and keep it to yourself. Good luck in trying to concieve and even if you never do there are lots of babies out there that don't have a mother and would love to be a part of your family. Again good luck and no harm intended if you took this message offensively.

I am pretty strict about the way I eat, but on Saturday's I eat whatever I want... usually I wind up eating WAY to much. 2 weeks ago knowing I would be doing a lot of eating I did several sets of deadlifts, which I strained a bit while doing. Around 7:30 I ate 2 large cheeseburgers, then an hour later I ate another one. I had also eaten a lot of pizza around 1 or 2 PM. Around 10 or so PM I started feeling guilty and decided i'd hit the punching bag for 10 or so minutes just to burn a few calories but wound up doing 30 minutes. That night I woke up a few times with my heart feeling like it was skipping and such. Since then I feel this feeling more often, but there feels like a big gas bubble in my throat that I can't quite belch out. There's only small belches, but it feels like this huge bubble inside. I take Previcid and Gas X which does seem to help, but if I do exercise much, afterward it feels like the heart is still skipping, but with my hand on my chest it is beating normally.

20080205152324AAQdM7H	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	I don't know what's wrong with my foot? Please help?	Okay so about 3 months ago i skateboarded down some stairs and landed awkwardly on my left foot putting pressure on my ligament i think? or the area on the side of my foot just under my heel bone.  Anyway, it gave me a bad cramp and i couldn't skate for the rest of the day, however i skated the next day.      The problem now is that everytime i go out and jump down gaps and stairs with my skateboard, it seems like i have to land a certain way which doesnt put impact pressure on the area under my heel bone, and if i do put pressure on it, i cant skate for 5 minutes, then i can skate after i give it 5 minutes. It happens everytime, its very stressful because ive lost a bit of skill due to this. Today it happened then i couldnt skate for the rest of the day. Its a cramp feeling everytime.      Anybody know whats wrong? You may say its bad to go down stairs but i go down 6 stairs as a pose to 20 stairs which professionals do.
