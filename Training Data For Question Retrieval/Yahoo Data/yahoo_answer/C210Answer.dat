Doctors will sometimes refer to a miscarriage as 'spontaneous abortion', but I am assuming you are talking about when a woman decides she doesn't want her baby and has it aborted.<br>  <br>  There are a few different types of abortions.  In early pregnancy, a tube is inserted into the woman's vagina, through her cervix into her uterus.  The tube is about as big around as a straw, I think (never had one).  They use strong suction, and the baby is removed, in pieces, along with whatever placenta is in there.<br>  <br>  There is also a D&C abortion, which involves a doctor reaching up inside with a scalpel, and scraping the baby and placenta out - I think these types of abortions are done a bit later in pregnancy, like after 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  There is also the morning after pill, which is taken with 72 hours of sex, and basically causes a period, so the fertilized egg does not implant.  There is also another type of chemical abortion which does the same thing, but is used after the egg has implanted.  <br>  <br>  There are other methods of abortion for later in pregnancy, but they are too gruesome for me to want to write them down.<br>  <br>  I am sorry, but there is no way I can divorce myself from my feelings and opinons on abortion.  When the 'facts' are so intimately involved in human life, how could anyone? A lot of people think even referring to a fetus as a baby is an expression of opinion.  Other people think referring to a fetus as a fetus, or a 'cluster of cells' is an opinion.<br>  <br>  I have been to one website, which I will not name here, that showed photographs of aborted fetuses from very early on, little, tiny disembodied, perfectly proportioned hands and legs and feet displayed on quarters.  I won't name the website because it was one of the more horrible experiences of my life (and I've had some bad experiences), itmakes me cry just to think about it. If you really want to see it, you'll have to find it on your own.<br>  <br>  The decisions we make, the opinions we embrace, are not separate from our morality, in fact they define it.  That is why this issue is so fraught with passion.  Because you can not separate fact from decisions and opinions and character - these are built on facts.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I have to agree - an organization that makes money by providing abortions could hardly be counted on to be neutral on the subject.|`|g4iElgObaa	Well there are two different abortion procedures. One is the aspiration method. Your health care provider will examine your uterus and you'll get medicine for pain, maybe a sedation. A speculum will be inserted into your vagina and the HCP usually injects medicine into or near your cevix to numb it... I believe then they stretch your cervix with dialators until it slowly opens. they might give you antibiotics to prevent infection.  Then they insert a tube through the cervix into the uterus. Either a hand-held suction device or a suction machine gently empties your uterus. It takes like 5-10 minutes to do the actual procedure, but it takes awhile to prepare the cervix. And it would take about an hour to recover.<br>  <br>  The other is called dilation and evacuation, which is pretty much the same steps all the way to the part where they open your cervix with dialators. In later second-trimester procedures, you may also need a shot through your abdomen to make sure there is fetal demise before the procedure begins. Your health care provider will inject a numbing medication into or near your cervix, and then a machine empties your uterus. This takes like 10-20 minutes and also a recovery time of one hour.|`|332c7905518ef071c394f0eaff959fb3aa	LOL @ plannedparenthood.org being unbiased. The abortion mill most definately is biased and makes you think having a abortion is great and easy. There are many different abortions, all oif which end in the murder of a baby. D&C= Dialate & Curette. They ake you dialate then cut the baby in pieces, and then suck it out with a vaccuum. This is the most common kind. |`|12ALQ3Qhaa	abortion is when you are pregnant and you dont want to be pregnant anymore. you have a procedure done so that youre no longer pregnant.|`|EHBm70R7aa	I agree that you should really look it up through plannedparenthood.org or something. At least then you would know the information is informative and unbiased.|`|XqfH76PMaa	This should answer your questions<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion</a>|`|Mof0hX5paa	they suck an unwanted baby out of your vagina
RpwYzQvEaa	Putting things in their mouth is a way of exploring the object.  My 15 month old still does it.  I think it tapers off at age 2 or slightly after.  Drives me crazy sometimes because I will see her moving her mouth around and it ends up being some mystery spec she found on the floor. =)|`|LKHnjAcaaa	never! i have a 3 year and she is still putting stuff in her mouth and up her nose<br>  it is nuts|`|XqfH76PMaa	Good question!  My boy is 2 1/2 and is worse than ever.  I can tell you that my 14 year old daughter finally stopped..lol|`|AA10624857	Every child is different so it is nearly impossible to say when you can expect this to stop. It will likely continue most of the time she is 1. When she gets closer to 2, you may notice a decrease, but it isn't a given. I am mom to 4 plus I have provided child care in my home for 21 years. I currently have a 2 1/2 year old in my care and just an hour ago I had to remind him not to put things in his mouth. It's a pretty daily occurrence for him. Generally speaking the oral stage subsides considerably around 3-4 years old, but it is not uncommon for you to still be reminding your little one not to put that in her mouth when she's 4-5 years old. It is a natural part of learning and exploration since kids use all their senses to find out about the world around them.  It will probably get better sometime between 2-3, but not go away completely until after age 3.|`|qayCggxMaa	Wish I knew.  My 3.5 year old still puts random things in her mouth sometimes.  She does it kind of absentmindedly.  Actually, she does it more than my 18 month old (but he still has a pacifier and I think since that's in his mouth it usually stops him - hate to see what happens when we take it away soon...).|`|AA10083573	My daughter is 25 and still does it! I guess it's all about stages. They go through different stages of life, exploring their world through taste. It's how they learn that things are either yucky or good. Unfortunately, some of these things can be very dangerous, especially when they get older and consciously put stuff into their mouths that they know is bad. At least you've got some control now. All you can do is to make sure that everything she can put in her mouth is put out of her reach. A really difficult thing in an active household, for sure. It's a wonder our kids survive childhood! Hopefully, you'll always be there to fish it out before she swallows it. My nephew swallowed a nickle once, and it passed through with no problem. Kids are pretty durable, for the most part. It's a good thing too. <*)))><|`|UgX5WeGPaa	Yup, my 15th month old still does too... just last night we had an issue with a rock he put in his mouth.. then i got bit from sticking my hand in his mouth!! hahaha... my nephew is 3 and i dont think he does it that much?|`|AA10091004	Around age 35. lol.  It lessens around 6 or 7. |`|2RE4Vi4aaa	She's gonna keep doing it for another 3-4 months or so...it's a really weird stage but just have patience with it. 
TadXgAZ9aa	I bought a vaporizer for my 3 month old daughter & it really helped moisten the air in our home. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should try that instead of the hot bath.|`|YBrbMPTmaa	have you tried rubbing a little vicks vapo rub onto his chest at night time,my eldest daughter always got croup in the colder weather and like you i couldn't get her onto a steamy bathroon i found that after a bath at night rubbing in the vick before or when she was in bed helped a lot,do this for 2/3 days and keep giving paracetamlo and neurofen as and when ,if he is still not right then i would be thinking about taking him to the doctors,and just because he is your 3rd doesn't mean we have to have all the answers every child is different being unsure doesn't make us bad parents |`|Tm1Rpfq4aa	raspy when laying down is not croup.  croup is when the airway in the throat starts to close up and makes your child's cough sound like a barking seal and voice/cry sound like a cat.  If you still feel he has croup all you can do is put him in the steamy bathroom or if it is cold where you are , dress him up and take him outside to breathe the cold air, it helps A LOT.  This is why when we rush our kids to the doc or hospital with croup because they are having trouble breathing, by the time we get there, their fine (croup most often occurs in the fall/winter and attacks most often occur at night).  Also, if you truly suspect croup, do not give him meds without talking to your doc as many meds make croup worse.<br>  Best of luck.<br>  <br>  Cool mist vaporizor can help, but cool mist not a humidifier|`|V0r6VUwzaa	Honestly, depending on your location, the air is becoming more crisp outside. You can take your baby outside with a light shirt on and let him breathe in the colder air. That helps their lungs quite bit with croup. My MD suggested that and it works wonders! Every once in awhile my 6 yr old will wake up with a croup cough (He has no tonsils/adenoids) and I do it everytime! Its a miracle more people dont try this before medicine~|`|pYzOZP3Xaa	My son had this and i bought a steam inhaler from boots and a vapouriser for his room and stuck pillows under the top of his matress to raise his head and help him breathe!|`|JltE5LIHaa	The fact that you are asking for help means you are not a bad mother, don't put yourself down. Try and prop him up when he goes to bed (pillows under the mattress help). try Olbas oil or similar on his bed clothes to ease congestion. the steamy bathroom is a good idea and I would consider trying this again. Maybe the tumble drier would work provided it doesn't have a vent (and I don't mean put the child in it before someone comes back with a smarmy comment!).  Even though you have had 3 children doesn't make you an expert. I have had 4. If things don't get any better after 48 hours he should see a GP, he may have a chest infection.|`|S2pA90gDaa	wait for him to fall asleep then take the lid off an electric kettle and place it in his room and let it steam the room whilst he sleeps,  keep a check that the kettle does not boil dry though, it will just keep boiling with the lid off and steam the room nicely for you.<br>  The other thing that I always found helped with croup was some karvol capsules that you can break open and put on his clothes,<br>  hope hes better soon
xae5cgXRaa	Stay away from drinking in the morning as it leads to forming the habit of starting your day with a drink.  Bad idea.  Don't use it to fall asleep either.  If you have a sleep disorder then this will only make it worse, in turn making the drinking habit worse.  Finally, yes alcohol can be detected in the blood test.  Though the span of the test is unknown to me.  I would think your breath may smell of it, having had a drink that morning.  |`|8W3JAEazaa	I wouldn't call you an alcoholic necessarily, though you have an alcohol problem. There are many ways to relax, clear your head, go to sleep etc. without alcohol!<br>  <br>  Drink milk and honey, Horlicks, have a hot bath, put lavender on your pillow.<br>  <br>  There's a product called Rescue Remedy which is basically a sleep/relaxation aid. You put a few drops on your tongue and it calms you down. It has alcohol in it, maybe brandy or something, but it's safe - so use of this might be a suggestion rather than a shot of whiskey!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rescueremedy.co.uk/RESCUE-Products_Rescue-Remedy---dropper-and-spray_pg43.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.rescueremedy.co.uk/RESCUE-Pro...</a><br>  <br>  Also, so you wake up in the morning properly, how about using some kind of really zingy shower gel.<br>  <br>  I love Original Source Lime shower gel (you can get it from like... Tesco lol)<br>  <a href="http://www.originalsource.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.originalsource.co.uk/</a><br>  Sorry to recommend products, they help me though.<br>  <br>  You should of course also speak to an adult, school nurse, teacher, friend etcetera etcetera...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|ablhNL0Maa	If the blood test is detailed enough, anything can show, substances/alcohol, etc. <br>  <br>  I would recommend finding another sleep aid, as the alcohol isn't really a good idea. |`|HhpRxYSLaa	you should sincerely stop this before you get into the habit of it when you're older.<br>  I won't say you're an alcoholic, but with what you're doing you're on the track of becoming one.<br>  <br>  Quit it, you're too young and shame on your grandmother for not doing anything about this.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	they only test your blood for certain things.  if they are testing for anemia they are testing for that.  if they are checking for alcohol they are testing for that.  get it?<br>  also, you are developing a drinking problem|`|FsYUBf6faa	yes i agree, please get some help love.|`|8znMgOCKaa	yes they can see you drink.<br>  please seek help, tell your mom. and your grandmother that she affects you. <br>  your only 14 and your killing your brain cells. fill your acholol bottles with water instead and drink that and pretend it's alcholol.<br>  please don't be an alcholoic.<br>  i lost my best friend because she had a drinking problem.<br>  she had just turned 15 two days before, she started out like you. a little here, a little there.<br>  now she is not here with us. i think "what if i helped her, what if i told someone, what if she seeked help on her own" i regret that i never helped her. she never thought any harm would come either...<br>  <br>  <br>  PLEASE BABY GET HELP...<br>  |`|h7qkIGsKaa	You could become a little dependant on this habit.<br>  <br>  Go and get help regarding the things you are concerned about and stop worrying about the alcoholic bit.  You're not, but you need some help.|`|q0zuRMA6aa	Get some help!|`|k8Jn3fwUaa	wth thats crazy you rele need help!|`|3UA2vu80aa	First of all, everyone gets stressed. Try to find something else to help you deal with your stress. You don't want to become dependent on alcohol at such a young age! They may have been able to detect it, but only if they were running a test specifically for drug/alcohol (it sounds like they were just doing a blood count). Seriously tho, I took care of patients who drank every day (and tipsy would be considered drunk) and you don't want to end up like them. It's not going to help you do any better on your courses, trust me. Meditate, do yoga, talk to friends/family, go take a walk, find some other way to cope, or you'll regret it in the future.
9wLraK7Caa	I think if you tell her you want to spend time with her and have fun with her that would do the trick.  She probably doesn't realize she is missing out on spending time with because she doesn't want to ruin your fun with your friends.

AA12020043	I didn't see you mention what your husband thinks of the middle name. I would listen to him if you are torn on what to do. The two of you may be able to come up with an acceptable alternative if you decide not to go with your father's name. You have some time to think about it. |`|dRIvxbpOaa	I think you should do it, he may be disappointed if not. but it's your opinion what counts so don't let anything else put you off.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You are the only person who can make that decision.

I'm sure your Dad would appreciate it.|`|4qLhWtAjaa	I think if you would like your dads name in your sons then go ahead and if you love you dad then how he is to other people dose not matter and i think it wold be nice <br>  Good Luck X|`|48RXUHh8aa	This I can not answer, but the answer is in your womb.|`|hCgTGDR8aa	i'm having a baby girl sometime next month, and throughout my pregnancy i thought i would name her after my great-grandmothers, Clara Ines (dad's grandma & mom's grandma). <br>  <br>  Last month my father and  i were talking about how a name can sometimes shape a person (well, that's what some of us believe), and also the Stereotypes that come with a name. He says he heard a speaker talk about how when you give your kid your own name, you are passing down a lot more about yourself (qualities as well as flaws). Idk, my dad really believes that stuff, and he convinced me to chose other names too, to give this child a fresh start. you know, so she wouldn't be following after someone's footsteps, good or bad. It's easier for others to relate the child to that person you named them after, they are being associated to them in some ways.<br>  <br>  I understand his point of view. Both of my great-grandmothers endured a lot of pain and suffering, but they were really strong women. I have to admit though, one of them had a personality i don't always think was very favorable. <br>  <br>  My father named my brother after him, with the Jr. at the end. and now he has a 2 year old with my step mom and he used his first name and gave him his grandfather's name as a middle name (so my bro's are named Jose Manuel and Jose Antonio). He says he regrets it now, and wants to tell my older bro to consider changing his name (he followed in many of my dad's old bad habits, drinking, womanizer, etc.), and is also thinking about changing my little brother's name to something more unique.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry i went on and on, but like i said, i'm having similar debate :-)<br>  <br>  anywho, i think if you have doubts, don't do it. You will regret it especially when people start pointing out FLAWS that your dad has, if your son (God-forbid), has any of them. <br>  <br>  btw my husband wants to name her Minerva: Roman goddess of intellect. I have a few others, but decided i'm going to make a definite decision once i see her for the first time :-)|`|5Wnv44iuaa	If you want to name your son after your father then you don't need to give an explaination to anyone.  Do what you feel is right in your heart.  <br>  <br>  Can I just suggest that if you do decide to name your son after your father, go with the full name Connor instead of Kon, which sounds like con-artist.  Caleb Connor sounds very nice together.  |`|J9JnKAlWaa	The simple jesture of honoring both fathers, would mean so much, regardless of some of his character traits.|`|EaezAUrUaa	It's just my opinion, but I think it would be lovely to honor both dad's! It's great that they stuck around and raised you guys (even if you think your dad can be kind of hard, you know he loves you!). Your dad would probably be tickled pink (in a manly Greek way!).<br>  <br>  I actually think Caleb Connor is a fantastic name (I like Connor more than Kon)!

If the answer is yes to either or both, then Social Services have a legal obligation to intervene.<br>  <br>  None of us are entitled to judge a parent on his or her lifestyle, nor the decisions made on the upbringing of their children, but you can ring up Social Services enquiry desk saying that you have seen a 2-year-old on a windowledge and you think this child may be at risk, and ask their advice.<br>  <br>  It may be negligence, but it could equally be just a few moments of inattention caused by a telephone going off, a pan on the boil, or even a call of nature.

Do the test as you say, then the doctor, then everyone else.<br>  <br>  When I was in  my teens I thought I was pregnant and I did tell my mother. She did go beserk and the reaction was bad, but I realise that not all mothers would react the same way.  Afterwards I discovered I was not pregnant after all, so I went through it all for nothing. <br>  <br>  It is perfectly understandable that you are scared.  Just take each day at a time.  If that feels too much, then split each day into two parts, morning and afternoon.  Just take it slowly as it comes and work through what you have to do in stages.  First things first, get that test done.  Take it from there.  Best of luck whatever happens. |`|E3glIl8Qaa	theres not really an easy way to tell your mum. 1st you got to decide what you want then tell people your pregnant.|`|FsYUBf6faa	you should have thought of that before...|`|FZpYkVNiaa	Listen it was best to not think of sex anyways.Its bad for your health this young.I am 18 and still a Virgin,For a reason.Well find the most accurate pregnacy test,Probally Digital Pregnacy tests from Walgreens,And Such or first response.If it comes out positive,Then go to the doctors to confirm it.Then tell your guardian,That your pregnant.It might not be  pretty reaction,But think about it,Theres no turning back,You have life inside of you that is devoloping,And theres no turning back<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck with everything sweetie!|`|NpS9rWoVaa	Save yourself and your unwanted child, get an abortion and if necessary ask your boyfriend for help paying for it.  The morning after pill RU486 is a must.  If he can't afford the money ask your parents for money for an abortion.<br>  <br>  Additionally, I recommend counselling. I am concerned with your health and happiness, why did you get pregnant so young?  A psychological counsellor can help you overcome these issues.|`|2ojRCxxHaa	Tell your parents. They will be shocked but they will help you make the right decision. This isnt the sort of thing you can hide from your family, it is not fair, and I dont think its legal either as a minor. If you do something without her knowing you could set her or others up for legal troubles. I know its terrifying but you gotta tell your family. They are the ones who will see you through this.|`|ixus1AWaaa	you people on here act like you never made mistakes. Anyway.... If you are pregnant keep your blessing. Your parents will be disappointed and upset but they will get over it later. Don't let people try to tell you to have a abortion cause God has blessed you with a child that you need to take care of. You will grow up really fast but that's apart of being a parent. I hope everything turns out okay.

What will your boyfriend think?<br>  <br>  I'm 30 and just had a little boy, and it's hard going.  After the birth you're in pain, trying to care for a baby and getting little sleep with 2-3 hour feeds.  If you have family support it will be helpful, but at  the end of the day that life is your responsibility.  <br>  <br>  If you were my daughter I'd explain the pros and cons,  babies are precious but you are still one yourself in a way.

Im 17 & 5 months pregnant & i was scared of telling my dad coz ii really didnt no how he would take it.. But he was over the moon lol.. Obviously he didnt say.

If ii had a 15 year old daughter i wud b happy & let down if u no wat i mean.. But i wud let her make up her mind about keeping baby or aborting.. & then tell her 2 keep safe from then on... But ii would b there by herside 100%.. Gud luk luv x|`|HPc7hpG7aa	Honestly it won't be easy confronting your mom. Although you may be surprised by her reaction. Her motherly instincts may very well kick in and she will be just as scared for you as you are for yourself. I didn't leave the house when I told my mother, but I left a very straight forward and honest note about what had happened and that I needed her help. She took to it very calmly. I don't suggest rejecting every suggestion she may bring up though as abortion, adoption as it can only reveal you haven't really thought about it and aren't ready. I am fairly certain your mother can't kick you out of the house as you are only of age 15.<br>  <br>  I can not completely relate to you as your situation is most likely different in some way. However I did get pregnant at 14 and am currently 32 weeks pregnant. You have all the right to be concerned, it is a major decision you have to make. But make the one you can live with and the one which is best for you and your baby.<br>  <br>  I agree with your decision to take another test, then to confirm it at the doctors, but I would advise you to take precaution and see the doctor to confirm your pregnancy anyways. Just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I wish the best for you!<br>  |`|T3neqEXqaa	First of all do you want to keep the baby? You have to ask urself that.<br>  I mean if your BF is going to stand next to you than good for him.<br>  See im turning 18 and i have never been pregnant.<br>  And when things all work out...i think that maybe you should think about getting on birth control if you can't stay away from sex. But you have to be 16. Other than that i would stay away from it until then. I know it might be hard and all.<br>  Ummm as how to tell ur mom..i have no idea..i'm 18 and my mom would be pissed...and ur alot younger than me. I would think about trying to talk to a counselor at ur school or something...and try to tell someone...a close friend to be there with you. Cause doing it alone is worse than not having anyone at all. So try...doing that and...well that is all i have right now. And if you don't want to keep it...then try to get a close friend and try to get an abortion.|`|Wqv3u0bVaa	i would of course be shocked and let my daughter know that it was a very stupid decision but that whats done is done and i would help her so she could stay in school and support her 100%....but i do not have a daughter yet but that is how i would like to handle it....i know alot of people who got pregnant between 14 and 17 and its not easy and im sure you mom will be upset but she will get over it eventually and love this new grandbaby...goodluck and congratulations. stay strong you can do this.|`|AaGa9Cdraa	15 with a baby is too much responsibility, you haven't lived your best years yet, i suggest you get rid off it because its too soon and will ruin your life, and yes its best to tell your parents im sure they'll understand, but if there not that kinda people then good luck|`|ZOTkj3H9aa	i would steel let her live her live with me i would be happy for her becouse i would have grandchildren but you r still to young but why did you have sex in the first place i had sex when i was 17 i think you are rushing your life you have all of your life to e grown you are taking it to far |`|C8vtxQkuaa	Sounds like a good plan!!<br>  <br>  I doubt your mum will kick you out, she'll probably be really shocked, maybe a bit angry, but she'll get over it coz she loves you and she'll love this kid!<br>  <br>  Do whatever feels right, babe. You'll know. Follow your heart. I rushed into an abortion, went to the first consaltation, booked the abortion, changed the date to later, went to the clinic on the second date. Sat in the waiting room full of chirpy people all waiting to abort their children and I knew then it werent right for me coz i was the only person in the room crying, so I told them to cancel my appointment so now I'm having a little kid! I'm only 17 and really scared too, so sorta know how your feeling!! :-) We'll both be fine I'm sure. Do what feels right. If you don't think you can look after it and don't wanna carry it either go for the abortion. If you wanna love it, keep it. If you wanna give it a chance but can't yourself, adopt it. It's your choice. And don't let anyone on here give you any crap for your decision, or for having sex at 15. It's normal :-) xxxxxxxxxxx

oIyXMnmcaa	Actually yes...I went to Future Shop to get a new washer and dryer and had to bring the kids with me. I normally would not worry seeing that they act well behaved in most public places however this time they went buzurk!<br>  <br>  I put Mya down to stand while I spoke to the sales guy and she took of running in one direction while Jasper tried climbing the appliances...I grabbed Jasper who started kicking and screaming and then took off after Mya and she was gone...(the place is huge with rows upon rows of electronics and appliances and games and vidoes....)OMG, I thought I was going to die when I could not see her. I paced up and down the isles calling her name and she had run right off. Finally after going into panic mode, I could hear her calling my name from the other side of the store. Needless to say...I could have beaten her there in the middle of futureshop. Jasper was pulling and struggling to get out of my grip the whole time so I am now carrying Mya and trying to hold Jasper's squiggling hand as he grabs at everything possible while I try to drag them out of the store. Jasper knocked over movies and a chip stand on the way out and Mya screamed in my ear cause she knew she was in crap when we got to the van. It was insane...everyone was starring at me and the kids were like someone else's children...I swear they were not mine! lol<br>  <br>  That is the first time I have had to deal with them acting like that...I was in shock that they had behaved that way and they will never do that again. I got both to the van and gave each a good swat on the bum and then buckled them up and it was silence all the way home.|`|VPB5Z8oTaa	My kids tried those tantrums in markets and you have to get a little cold hearted. Whenever they did it in an isle, I would step over, one foot on each side of them, and say, 'When youre done, I'll be in the next isle!' and walk away, strolling down the isle with the cart, take the corner, look back and wave 'bye bye'--to hear them run down the isle and catch up and walk behind me. I'd bend down and tell them quietly that tantrums dont make me happy and they embarrass the both of us and if you do it again, I WILL leave you here!' Smiled, and continue shopping and get them involved in it (which cereal do you like, find this item on the coupon...). At the check-out, my youngest, Sabrina, threw such a fit because I wouldnt buy her candy, falling to the floor, screaming, arms and legs everywhere--while everyone was watching, I bent down and said 'I hope youre new mommy will put up with your crap because I wont--bye bye' , stepped over her and headed for the door.  She was at my heels before the first doorway. A lady met me in the lot and said she was so impressed--she would have given in. I didnt even have a 'talk' with her, just an icy stare. Sabrina never did it again! Dont forget youre in charge!|`|oRylYD7haa	For the sake of your sanity and the other shoppers pick the child up. kicking and all with her back to you and your arms firmly under her shoulders walk out. Put her sassy butt in the car. Tell her that is not acceptable and leave. When she calms down have a nice little talk with her. She will figure out what is proper behavior real quick. Whatever you do, do not go back for the item she threw a fit for.  |`|J1stiMioaa	my son has some corking tantrums, due to him being autistic and a bit unable to grasp the concept of right and wrong, as i cant pick him up anymore (he is a big 7 year old and im all of 5' tall), i tend to find ignorance is bliss! and my reply to 'i want this' tantrums is 'i want a son that is going to behave so it looks like we are both gonna b disappointed doesnt it'|`|JltE5LIHaa	No but I do recall when my youngest son threw a wobbly outside a shop because I put one of those wrist lead things on him. He screamed and yelled and threw himself on the floor. I just ignored him and let him get it out of his system then he just stopped because he did not get a reaction from me. One woman who was sat on a bench said that i should have "belted the living daylights out of him cos if he was hers she would have done".

That was horrible. mine is 16 months|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	Mine have each tried it a few times, but the youngest is 4 and it hasn't happened in a long time.  I try not to leave the store because mine used to do it at the checkout line after things were starting to ring up and I didn't want to have to go through the whole thing again (plus I needed the stuff since I only shop every other week).  I would let them know (very softly in their ear) that it was unacceptable behavior and that if I had to leave the store without what we came for, they would lose their favorite toys when we got home.  They'd stare and me and think about it, if they did it more when we got home I actually took their favorite toys away for the entire day (I shopped in the morning) and they couldn't have it back until the next day.  I would also talk to them and say things like, "I know your angry, but we need the food at home for others."  "I don't understand why you are so upset and need to act this way."  Or my favorite response when they said I'm mean, "Yes, I am.  You'll have something to tell your therapist when you're older since they always blame the mom anyway!"  The cashiers loved this one.|`|bCcQBG23aa	Not yet but I am prepared for that day to come soon.|`|Qks0PQhAaa	yeah last saturday lol and my daughter is 6 years old and still doing it,she seems to think she can get whatever she wants,and its embarrassing when you tell them no and they don't listen,leave them to have their temper tantrum it is embarrassing when every ones looking at you but they do learn when you leave them to it and walk off they soon come running up to u knowing they are not going to get it,the worst thing i hate is when the supermarket is packed and ur trying to concentrate on remembering what u got to get,you have trolleys going into you and a screaming kid on the other not a great expierence |`|b3701715d7f2027b9badd9cfdd2154fcaa	I'm very lucky that my daughter has never done that however one of her friends did while I was at the supermarket with her.

s8VgyzE2aa	absolutely. ADD and ADHD are real however they are highly over diagnosed. I have known doctors who threw a kid on medication and labeled him ADHD based solely on the parents description of wild behavior. No thorough evaluation or anything was conducted. <br>  <br>  Kids aren't allowed to be active and spirited anymore, if they are they are labeled ADHD. I think it's ridiculous. My husband's aunt has two kids both labeled ADHD andon medication but this is clearly a case of bad parenting. They have never been consistent or very attentive to the kids. I think many cases of "ADHD" are cases where it is just bad parenting or just a normal spirited child. <br>  <br>  It seems lately that whenever a child doesn't act like a little adult and obey like a robot then parents and teachers want to find something to blame and want to try and change them with medication or use alabel as an excuse. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I DO believe these conditions exist, just not to the extent that they are diagnosed. |`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I thinnk that ADD and ADHD are diseases created by doctors so that they can get kick backs from the pharmacuetical companies that make the meds.  I think it's an excuse for parents to use for a reason why their child doesn't behave.  I also know that if someone's child has been diagnosed with it, the parents can get a monthly stipend from the government for them, which is probably another reason so many parents are ok with their kid being diagnosed with it.  I am very involved in all my children's activities, and even a leader for some of them, and it has been my experience that the parents of the kids who have "add/adhd" are the parents who just drop off their kids and go, or yell at the kid to stop doing something, but then never lift their *** off the chair they are sitting on to actually go do anything about it.  I am not saying all parents of kids who have been diagnosed with it are like that, but the ones I personally have been in contact with have been.<br>  <br>  I have 3 kids, two of which are boys.  The boys are SOO rowdy.  They wrestle with each other from the minute they wake up until it's time to go to bed.  I am sure that if I took them to the dr. they would get diagnosed with add/adhd.  But they don't have it.  They are just rowdy little boys who like to play.  I'm sure I will get some thumbs down, but that's how I feel about it.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	It is possible that SOME are.  Some are also the result of diet (i.e. certain additives and preservatives in food can cause problems), too much TV, and also video games.  However, some are also genuine cases.  I do believe, however, that all avenues should be pursued before kids are put on medication (change diets, remove video games, etc).  I think sometimes it is easier just to get medication, and teachers seem to find that the easiest route, with the quickest results for them.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Possibly, but not in the sense that I think you mean.  There are studies out there that link TV watching for very young children (under 2) to ADD and ADHD.  Children that young are still developing in many ways, but particularly neural pathways in the brain.  The brain waves of someone watching TV are eerily similar to the brain waves of a child with ADHD.  It is theorized that too much TV while a young child's neural pathways are still being formed will "hardwire" a child into the ADHD brainwave pattern.  Can't remember where I read that study; it was in a psychiatric nursing journal probably 5-6 years ago.  Interesting theory.<br>  <br>  I also believe that ADHD can be misdiagnosed.  One thing that I've witnessed in my career is that children who suffer from long term abuse tend to get "hardwired" into that "fight or flight" response.  They have been in danger for so long that their bodies are just constantly in that hyper-alert state: adrenaline flowing, all of the reflexes that we have when we are in danger are running full time.  So, since they have to re-learn what it is to relax and NOT be in danger, they exhibit a lot of hyperactive traits.  <br>  <br>  Just a couple thoughts.  Psychiatry (especially child psychiatry) is so far behind other fields of medicine that it's appalling.  We aren't so far removed from the "asylum" settings in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest".  |`|3F8f1SoQaa	no. for sure!<br>  <br>  My oldest son was home with me for 2.5 years. He had my undivided attention for all that time. We knew at 2 years old that he was different. At 6 years old he was diagnosed with ADHD, and at 11 years old with PDD-NOS.<br>  <br>  My daughter was sent to a baby sitter starting at 9 weeks old. she went there at least part time until she was 6 years old. she is almost 9 and does not have ADHD.<br>  <br>  ETA: we honestly had no clue what my son had. we did our research though. we bought a book written by a doctor who has ADD himself and highlighted important parts. we got notes from the kindergarden teacher about his behavior at school. We got notes from his TWO babysitters, one of whom has a daughter with ADHD. I took ALL of this to his family doctor and said "I think he has ADHD...what do YOU think?". His PDD and his ADHD have been confirmed by 3 different psychologists : 1 at mental health, 1 at school, and 1 who specializes in autism spectrum  disorders. Are you trying to tell me that 3 independent doctors are just pulling a diagnosis out of thier butts to make me happy?|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I think most cases are. I don't believe in medicating a child because they are being a child......... some kids are just hyper and active|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	i wouldn't say lack of attention from parents but i think that not all children that have energy are add or adhd. i think that some parents just like lazy kids so go to the doctor and complains then are diagnosed with it. kids today are not allowed to have energy and play like we were when we were young. people automatically think add or adhd. (not every single person but a lot)|`|Ezkn5azdaa	No I don't agree with you. Because I have a six year old that has ADHD. I try to give him attention or try to play with him and all he doesn't want attention from me at all. He wouldn't sit still for me to read him a book when I try everything. ADHD is something that in the child brain I forget I would explain. My son caseworker told me all about ADHD and want causes it. I try my best to give him attention and he never wanted. He hyper all the time and he would be jumping off the walls like crazy. He wouldn't be able to focus at all. When he was preschool and have ADHD.

I may even have a little of it because of my daydreaming and such. |`|AA10063059	i know from experience some times it is caused through  additives and food colourings in squash and sweets etc|`|e9kvxIc3aa	More than some!!|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	no|`|zypBiK8Daa	yes|`|B7RXT0i7aa	no. and a lot of teachers will pressure you to put your child on meds, but beware! a lot of kids with add are super smart and all that extra energy will make them seem like they aren't paying attention when they actually already understand the material very quickly and are bored and fidgety. |`|qbOc2dBQaa	I think it's more likely a result of too much TV or spending too much time online to be honest which would explain why there has been an explosion of these cases.  I also don't think every diagnosis of it is correct.
geHVaxaOaa	with my first i was in labour for 3 days in and out for the first day and half then all on i got to 8cm then nothing and went back down before the midwife picked up on it i was induced after that and then it was another day and half before he was born not breathing and i loss alot of blood he is all good now but i tell you having my second i was scared but thankfully i had her safely she was 3hours induced after being overdue by 14days this time i hope that it is even better and i dont have to be induced. just goes to show that every labour is different |`|YUtLMLoyaa	my first was very easy i say maybe 1 hour by the time i got to the hospital within maybe 30 min my baby boy was out he was to term health but i think what helped me was that i was very active while preg. my hubby and his bro decided to go out that night and they had me dancing away so the next day he wa ready. no i didnt drink or smoke never have and never will. my second son as not that quick with him it was maybe close to 3 hours, thats proof that not all pregnancy are alike.|`|l9J6k9Ifaa	I wish.  I was in labour for 9 hours (which yeah is less than some but was still long) and my son didn't want to come out.  Almost got stuck in the birthing canal...  Almost had to use forcepts to get him out but luckily he came.  2 hours of hard labour pushing before he came out.<br>  Hope this time is much easier for me... but then again I won't be delivering naturally this time.  I get to be induced now...|`|AA10516678	Well not really I went a day overdue and was in labor for 12 hours. But soon as the epidural kicked in everything was fine but they induce my labor also.|`|zknBAdilaa	Mine was horrible i erupted if by chance i would of been home me and my baby would of died i was 36 weeks but i wouldn't change athing|`|RntKwODQaa	my first child was so easy no pain meds she wes born at 36 weeks it was quick and painful,  my next three were all about 3 months early and it was the worst labor ever and they were all under 3 lbs.|`|QAZDPuO9aa	congrats on your baby. when i had my first daughter my labor was 12hours and with my second daughter my labor was 44 mins. |`|dnRte8U7aa	Congrats on the baby.

I WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISED HOW EASY IT WAS|`|rlLf5m0xaa	All of my deliveries was easy except my 1st son's delivery, but he was 8 lbs. 14 1/2 ozs.when he came out he tore the main artery in me, and I alsmost bled to death, until they took me for emergency surgery to stop the bleeding; my daughter was 7 lbs.13ozs. very easy,(1hour labor that felt like menastration cramps, my 2nd son was 7 lbs. 15 ozs. very easy, 1 hour delivery cramps, my 3rd son was 7 lbs. 11 ozs.I started dialating and before my doctor could put on his gown, Johnnny was out.My special gifts from God!|`|Ulkdaardaa	Lucky You!  with my son I was in labor 12 hours but when it was time to push he came almost too quick they told me to stop pushing till the doctor got there but it was like I had no control my body was pushing him out on it's own.  and this time around I will be very grateful if she comes out easy but will love her no matter what.|`|A2XYCdOYaa	Well I haven't got a very good pain threshold but if I did then yeah, you could say my labor was relatively easy without any complications.  My labor lasted 7hours from the first contraction... I did end up with a second degree tear though :(|`|1jwEqxFlaa	My first was 1 hour and second was 2 hours so mine were pretty easy.

H0fXySX9aa	with my first daughter who is now 5 i was at the supermarket paying for my shopping i had my cash and my daughters play money in my bag i just picked hers up with out looking and handed it to the cashier ,<br>  i then walked off thinking i had paid for it.<br>  i got called back and realized what i had done but how embarrassing lol|`|EvXqkrvAaa	Hahaha that is hilarious, I myself have a bad case of baby brain lol, I put sugar in the fridge and milk in the pantry and things like that, only public thing has been asking for a hot dog at the chemist lols<br>  <br>  I don't think this is classed as baby brain but when I was pregnant with my daughter every time I opened the fridge door she would cop it :S I think that was just ignorance of how big my belly was |`|63bxt86taa	mines really similar to yours! poor receptionists must have to put up with alot. lol<br>  mine was at my 13 week scan i was talking to the receptionist and she said "address- has it changed?" and i said "no" then she said "date of birth?" and i said "no, thats not changed either". she looked at me like i'd just fallen out the crazy tree. lol|`|G3bETlH7aa	I was ordering supplies for my work and a week in a half later they were at my homes door step, and my co-workers were getting frustrated because they didn't know what was taking the shipment so long|`|ojTPV57aaa	LOL what a funny story! Mine was when i started putting strange things in the fridge!! And when everyone would ask questions and id forget or say silly things :) I tell you one thing once that little one arrives you still have baby brain! Good luck with your pregnancy!|`|JjhChU2Waa	when i tryed to use my credit card to open the front door..!!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Aww bless you! It only gets worse haha. I think my worst baby brain case was when I made my mum a cup of tea cos she'd been out shopping.. I made it but she wasn't back. I put away the milk (or what I thought was the milk) and went to watch TV. She came back, put the shopping away and came to ask me why i'd put a cup of tea in the fridge.. :) she couldn't stop laughing!|`|5IlaGPxUaa	I think it was the time i was looking for my car keys and frustrated i sat on my couch put my car keys on the coffee table and cryed about it without realising the car keys were now DIRECTLY infront of me where i had just sat them on the coffee table<br>  I felt like an idiot and my partner was right there to see it happen and reminds me about it and tells everyone about it to this day lol<br>  <br>  Arggghhh|`|WrGq35zSaa	lol, poor you.<br>  <br>  When I was pregnant with William & Tobias, I went to the doctors surgery to have my blood pressure checked.<br>  I went in, and the doctor asked for my hand, and I was somewhere with the Faeries. I said as straight as straight can be, *I can't marry you, I am with Andrew*.<br>  <br>  Seriously it gets worse and worse, every child you have.|`|rgFbgliYaa	That is one of the funnier stories I've heard lately.<br>  I'm not laughing at you BTW, I'm laughing with you!|`|GZdvHbT5aa	The other day, I walked into work with my son's sippy cup full of juice, and left my coffee in the car.<br>  <br>  And then a few weeks before that, I walked around the house looking for my cell phone for 20 mintues, and was running late for work.  I was getting so peeved off, and said, "DANG-IT" and my husband said, "Whats wrong" and I said "I can't find my damn cell phone" to which he responded, "honey, aren't you talking to me on it?" I had been talking to my husband on my CELL PHONE, the whole time I was looking for it. I felt like an idiot.|`|J1stiMioaa	when pregnant with my 3rd son isaac i was on the phone to the electric company, they asked me to confirm my address and i couldnt for the life of me remember! i said 'im sorry, i cant remember where i live i'll have to ring you back later'! i still cringe.  and it gets worse with each pregnancy and lasts longer after the birth!
J1stiMioaa	i have 3 children, and that is ALWAYS my answer even though one is in heaven. if your mother died you wouldnt say you didnt have a mum would you? you would say your mum passed away. i feel this is the same for miscarriage/stillbirth, just because the baby isnt here it doesnt mean he/she never existed|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	First of all, I am VERY sorry for your loss, and I personally feel you certainly do have the right to call yourself a mother.<br>  <br>  You carried your child ...something every mother does. It just so happens mother nature had other plans.<br>  <br>  You are a mother from the moment you become pregnant.<br>  <br>  Once, again, I'm very sorry for loss.<br>  Fellow mother :-)|`|4bjbbUmaaa	As soon as you became pregnant you become a mother no matter what anyone else says or thinks, i understand totally how you feel and the loss you are feeling at this moment,but if anyone asks you tell them straight and i am sure you would of been a perfect was a perfect mum... take care x|`|7kHTQJmHaa	Yes you have every right to say that. And to feel a mothers love. You have been a mother. While others are able to hold their baby's in there arms, moms like us, who have lost our babies to miscarriage, have still got to hold our babies under our heart. You are a mother. And always will be a mother. I hope that one day you will get to enjoy holding your baby in your arms. It is so hard to have a miscarriage. And only women who have had them understand that. I'm lucky, i have two now, but still have a problem carrying a baby after i get pregnant to 11 weeks. Bless you for asking this wonderful question and let the rest of us know that we aren't alone in how we feel either.|`|jlIR21Hqaa	i totally understand what your talking about, i've had 3 miscarriages and im only 18... and i too love all 3 of my angel babies!!  <br>  <br>  you have every right to consider yourself a mother, you most certainly are a mother!!<br>  <br>  what other people think and say don't let it get to you they've obviously never been through the heart ache and pain that you've gone through.<br>  <br>  im so sorry about your loss!! good luck in future pregnancies!!|`|48FhNjz4aa	Yes you are a mother, i am sorry for your loss~  don't let anybody tell you your not a mother they are so rude ~ what gives them any right?  I would love to even have the feeling of knowing i am pregnent, have a wonderfull night : ) |`|oybsfVqPaa	You are a mother.<br>  You mothered a child, it's just the the baby didn't get to see the second stage of life.<br>  <br>  Don't ever let anybody tell you you're not a mother. You love your baby, just as anybody else would.|`|SoRLHQeRaa	You are definitely a mother, in your head and in your heart. Sorry for your loss x|`|b10aMPdOaa	Yes, you were a mother to your unborn child for 17 weeks.  You had all the mother instincts.  If you loved your baby then your'e a mother.|`|sYsfI856aa	I say that you can consider yourself a mother, who has lost her child. I've miscarried twice, but very early on. At 17weeks, wow... I'm sorry you went through that. You definately could have loved that baby as much as you would had you made it all the way. It was inside of you and you were nurturing it already.<br>  <br>  The only thing I could see is the experience of raising a child of your own, it's not something you have yet. You still have the love for a child of your own. I hope you make it through the tough times and someday do get to experience the full motherhood. 
fsNU3T6Laa	You won't get any milk until after the baby is born.  The loss of the placenta is the signal for your body to prepare for milk.  In fact, if not all of the placenta is delivered (if a piece is left inside) then the woman will not lactate well.  You may get some colostrum if you pump early, but it also may cause you to go into labor.  I remember I pumped because I was a few days overdue, and it was extremely uncomfortable.  I couldn't stand it, and I had to stop after five minutes.  I regularly pump now, and it's not uncomfortable, it's a far cry from that now.  But anyhow, I wouldn't even advise pumping as a method to induce labor.  Well, I hope I helped, take care.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	No! You don't even have milk until 2 days after delivery and your boobs will be sore if you try to force out colostrum. It's okay if you're tandem nursing and you still have milk in though. |`|FSPAKELyaa	if you mean pumping your breasts, then no. the milk doesnt come in until the baby is born.  |`|9cu82009aa	No you shouldn't try to pump, it's only colostrum, if your boobs are itchy (like mine) just hand express the colostrum out before or whilst you are in the shower... I do. It doesn't send you in to labour early, I've done it for the last two pregnancies and this one (from 20wks, once it starts coming in for me, didn't get it with the first one, she was born 3 days before she was due), and my second daughter was 6 days overdue, the last one was 2 days overdue, and this one we're yet to see.|`|cnMXJMFUaa	No no no no!!!<br>  <br>  First off you have no milk to pump until after the baby is born..<br>  <br>  Second, it can cause you to go into labor too soon!|`|XNJBHikHaa	As in your breasts? then No!!!  You shouldn't at all..|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	NO DONT!!! IT WILL PUT U INTO EARLY LABOUR!!!!!|`|AA10516678	No I don't think u can because when the baby is born only the colstrum (if that's how u spell it) comes out then like 3 days later ur milk start coming in|`|q3bCwBCXaa	No. i heard you can go into labour early.
F1cMkH2Caa	live on girl live on |`|hswTS1jVaa	Tell him. Then take care of yourself to have a healthy baby. |`|5LrqxCd6aa	You should tell your ex that you are pregnant because he has a right to know.  How old are you? Maybe you should think about adoption. Why did your boyfriend break up with you? Is he a good guy? If not, then do you really want him to be a part of your child's life? Just a few things to think about...Good luck.|`|9bUN1AHFaa	First you need to talk to him.  Find out where he is at and go from there.  He may take a few days to soak it all in and figure it out and let him have that time. And maybe he will be interested in being a part of this child's life.  If not then you need to think about what would be the right choice for you.  If you are young and you are not ready to be a single parent then you could place the baby up for adoption.<br>  No matter what you are pregnant and there is going to be a baby in your life.  Hopefully your ex boyfriend will be a man and step up to the plate.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Go ahead and tell him because he has the right to know.  Just tell him without any expectations of how he'll act.  He will most likely be scared and overwhelmed and perhaps a little angry.  Its best to tell him in a common place with lots of people to discourage him from yelling and screaming.  After you tell him, just go on leading your life.  Let HIM decide how involved he wants to be.  Don't push him and don't guilt him.  Just let him figure things out for himself just like you are having to do.  Good luck.|`|l5O6CTzJaa	Get an abortion and forget about your ex-bf...get on with your life.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Being scared isn't going to change reality.<br>  <br>  If he is not willing, able, or prepared to be a part of the baby's life, there is nothing you can do to change that.  You need to tell him that the baby is his, and that he has a choice to make...one that is likely to change his life.  He needs to decide if he wants to be a part the baby's life or not.  If he decides that he doesn't care enough to do it, your fears aren't going to help.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you need to start preparing to become a single parent.  Hard as it is, you need to get used to that idea.  Even if the ex boyfriend wants to be a part of the baby's life doesn't mean you guys are necessarily going to get back together.  It doesn't necessarily mean he will be there to support the two of you when you need him emotionally, financially, and physically.|`|I6d0I6kmaa	all you can do is tell him and hope that he will want to be in the babies life.<br>  Just remember to explain to him that you are not trying to get him back and you don't want him to think that is what you are doing because  as soon as he thinks that he will get defensive and play it off as you need him back and are faking the whole thing . take the positive test results with you when you tell him. |`|1557866d22112c5c71c048ca6dd77616aa	If you want this baby you should keep it no matter what.  You should also maybe wait til after your 1st trimester (12 weeks) to tell him that way you know that you are past the point most miscarriages happen.  He deserves to know but don't expect anything from him except for financial support.  You shouldn't get back together just for the baby, that will just make you guys both unhappy and cause a stressed environment for the child.  You are old enough and so is he to take responsibility and care for a child.  |`|gFiRi5xnaa	If my boyfriend had left right before I found out I was pregnant, I would of waited until I was really showing and then show up at his job(of course he works at Palais Royal/Bealls) and see his expression, walk past and say, "yeah, its yours" and walk off and see what happens after that.|`|aEpN5FuJaa	the best thing to do is talk to him. write him a letter, an email anything he needs to know. <br>  you may also collect child support if you can prove he's the father. <br>  if he doesn't believe you are pregnant tell him you'll bring him to a doctors appointment or bring a paper baack from your doctor. good luck!|`|JeGFjGWqaa	Well he needs to know. Its his baby just as much as it is yours.<br>  Whether he decides to be apart of your babys life is up to him.<br>  <br>  I know you are afraid of being a single mother<br>  but as long as you can love and support the baby you'll be fine!|`|k0FZTrGXaa	Tell him and see what happens. Just don't think that because you are pregnant it will mean you'll get back together. Good luck.|`|TaHcrGmKaa	Make sure you get child support on his ***.|`|YrOO55Quaa	I'm 23 and just had my baby, I found out that my bf was cheating on me when I was 9 months pregnant and now he's not a part of the baby's life - by his decision, not mine.<br>  <br>  I'd say tell him, if he chooses not to be a part of the baby's life, then go for child support. Your child at least deserves that. He doesn't have to be together with you in order to be a good dad, he just has to be willing to be there for his child. <br>  <br>  Being a single parent  isn't easy, but it's so rewarding. Just surround yourself with a strong support group and people who are willing to help with the baby! <br>  <br>  Stay strong, you'll be more than fine, you can definitely do this!|`|BYBgDkX6aa	I would tell him. He should know since he is the father. You shouldn't be scared of being a single parent, it isn't as hard as people make it seem.  I'm 19 my little boy is 2, and me and his father split up when he was 1.  I was scared at first too, but I love my son and will do anything for him.  His father sees  him every once in awhile, but i just see it as his loss.  The only thing you can do is hope for the best and that you have a beautiful healthy baby!<br>  <br>  Good luck....|`|u3elUSczaa	Do what you have to do to take care of your kids..<br>  If that means telling him so be it..<br>  If its his kid you should not be scared to tell them.<br>  But, if you dont want to tell him dont..<br>  If i was in the situation, I would tell him.<br>  because the child is not only your responsibility, he helped to create it, its his as well<br>  |`|GFjI6OJEaa	Talk to him even though your not together he still has a right to know!|`|qasBvPcfaa	Tell him and hope for the best.
69400ff3c9527d4ac1da126831a6e7e3aa	i found out that i was pregnant only 2wks after having intercourse with my partner. My symptoms start the same day. I didn't get my menstruation that whole month. I was scared at first and as my baby start growing inside of me i was excited.|`|ygVTtSNVaa	I was having tummyaches and someone at worked joked about how I was probably pregnant so on my lunch break I ran to Wal Mart grabbed Chicken strips and Potato Wedges and 2 pregnancy tests, lol. Got home at 2am and took the tests and both came back positive (on the day I took the tests I was exactly 4 weeks pregnant). That was my only symptom until about 4.5-5 weeks pregnant I started getting sick every morning, then by 6 weeks I was having all day sickness and breast tenderness. Best of luck TTC!|`|AA10516678	The breast terderness and peeing alot came two weeks after conception but the nausea didn't come until I was lke 8 weeks.

With my first pregnancy I spotted with my second pregnancy I had a full period and then just didnt come on my period nomore.|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	I started feeling pregnant even before I found out I was. Just didn't feel like myself. About two weeks after I found out, I started having morning sickness. That lasted for about 3 months and went away. <br>  I also got quite a few headaches. Those were bad. The only way I dealt with them was to put a cool rag on my head and try to sleep. Since you can't take any medication. |`|T48smu01aa	well I gave up on trying for a baby my third month ( I am very impatient haha, I do the same when I try to loose weight) Anyways I felt cramps and just new I was going to start so I prepared only weird thing is my boobs didn't hurt that month and I was peeing a lot before I started I thought maybe it was a UTI or something coming on. I only thought this because I was 90% sure I passed my ovulation time to conceive b/c my hubby was gone for the 2 nights I was ovulating so I just said water screw it this month....well three days after my period was suppose to start I took a test mid day and waalaa!! I was pregnant who would of thought huh! I was so excited!

vSZ3ERvfaa	Hi, I'm currently 28 weeks and so far I've gained around 23 lbs. But before I was pregnant I was 99lbs and I'm 5'3..idk if that is the reason for my weight gain. This is also my 1st pregnancy and I'm not showing that much either. The last dr I seen on my last appt also kind of scared me bcuz he suggested that I get an ultrasound to see how she is growing. Hopefully all is fine though..good luck and congrats!|`|9f90f9b019c9ba3de2a04ccca1f605deaa	They used to tell women to only gain like 15 pounds.  Last time around i gained hardly any in my first trimester, but by 28 weeks I had gained 20 lbs or so.  I'm glad you are going to the doc- did you have bad morning sickness?  If so- that could be the reason.  I know one lady I worked with said that she didn't realize she was pregnant until she was 5 mos along.  |`|AA10516678	Well I've gained only like 15 pounds and I am 28 weeks pregnant. But I guess it just depends on if u were overweight or underweight or just average.|`|HpjqN8gsaa	i was 7 and a half stone before i was pregnant, im only 26 weeks now but i weigh 10 stone 3 pound now! i am having twins tho lol|`|439ar75Iaa	well Im 5'7 and when I was pregnant with my daughter I gained about 30-40lbs. But I started showing a little when I was about 4 1/2 months an I was hudge when I gave birth to her at 42 1/2 weeks. But if your Dr. is concerned you should try to gain some weight because it can be dangerous for the baby. But the further along you get the more you should gain. and at the end of your pregnancy the Dr.s say you gain about  1lb a week.|`|lRneqVEKaa	Well, Congratulations first!<br>  <br>  I have gained about 16 pounds until my 28th week, but i am underweight.<br>  It depends on what level you are in, if you're overweight then it's fine, maybe your body has high metabolism. Don't worry, at least you are gaining weight, and you will gain more as you progress.<br>  I hope everything went fine with your ultrasound.<br>  <br>  PS: always eat, it's the only time where you can feel freeeee about food as you should gain weight.|`|mtiMXfg8aa	I am 29 weeks and have gained about 13-14lbs. <br>   <br>  Everyone is different. I am sure you are fine.|`|5QDouy4Uaa	I'm 18 weeks and I have only gained one pound..maybe 2 or 3 by now i suppose (I haven't been weighed in two weeks). my doctor told me I would gain whatever I needed too. and I was actually considered under weight. I"m a small girl so you think my body would gain more. no matter how much I eat I just can't gain anything and I haven't been sick in a long time. so I'm kinda in the same boat as you.
21b1dee7e85d9bd51df3ef60d1da1bd4aa	I'm not 16 but I did like high school. I went to HS in Texas, right by nasa. It is a excellence school which requires a lot of work on the students part to be good, get awesome grades, and particpate in everything! <br>  <br>  School otherwise, is what it is, school. You must have some credits to your name to really get anywhere these days, and in your case, probably even more. <br>  <br>  I hated school, taking classes you don't like or even having the annoying teachers. Its all about growing up and learning to deal with others ( or situations) that are out of your hands. I had teachers I didn't really like but I made the class fun (I was the smart *** in the back) and my friends always helped cause I would vent to them in the 5 mins we had in between classes. <br>  <br>  Though, trust me. I mean what I say. Life does get better. College you can go anywhere, away from everyone and take whatever classes you like. Yes, professors expect excellence from you, but most of all, you should expect that for yourself. You'll get through HS and realize at times these days, if you get a few bads one, that you wished you had done something more in the HS or joined that club. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good luck, tho. Life will get better. <br>  Happy Halloween! |`|E3glIl8Qaa	im not 18 but i hated school so much i left when i was 15|`|wH3Z1mSfaa	I love high school.<br>  It's been hectic with a lot of drama, but hey, it's part of it.<br>  I love that I'm spending a lot of time with my best friend before we head to college.<br>  It sucks, because I'm a junior, and I'm already counting down how many month of school I have all together.<br>  15 month. And those months will fly by so fast.<br>  I wish I could back to freshman year.|`|IvT6AIXtaa	High School isn't that bad. Yeah its different but its basically the same except more freedom.|`|75acbeaefbdb50e3100c79930d1c607caa	ur in the preschool section silly girl<br>  but i hated highschool all 3 n 1/2 yrs!|`|dq6E0qHOaa	its ok|`|lGhIf5CHaa	my favorite thing that i disliked the most was the lunch...IT SUCKED!!!!! and the thing s that i like about it was the kisses and fights. Are you going into high school?|`|6yO9RLW9aa	HATEEEEEEE IT|`|vap6okjSaa	You should put this in the adolescent section.. not toddler and preschooler...
b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	Sounds like Absolutely normal teething behaviour to me !<br>  Is she drooling a lot too?<br>  teething gel and a teething ring will also help(slightly chill the teething ring in the fridge) she may also find some comfort in sucking on a cold wet facecloth.<br>  teething is a really pain full stage as the teeth move up and down before the break through. Don't strees there is light at the end of the tunnel!<br>  Good luck|`|AA11113671	shes teething! try giving her a paci, but also hold her, so shes still comfort sucking. (just not biting you!!! lol)|`|8lcNupM2aa	My son is almost 7 months and he just got his first 2 teeth within the past few weeks. Before this though he had started doing the same thing.. biting down on me and then he just decided he doesn't even want them as pacifiers anymore. Not long after that one tooth came out. He started biting on everything even more, including me when I tried to breastfeed again.  The other tooth just came out not long ago and he is trying to tear into everything he can get his hands on and he is one cranky boy sometimes.  He mostly gets up at night with his fingers in his mouth and I have to hold in for 2 min or so until he is back asleep.  I guess he just wants me to comfort him since he's in pain.<br>  <br>  Before the teeth popped out he had stopped sleeping at night very well and had been waking up to eat also..and it was all night long! Like every 2 hours or something crazy.<br>  <br>  Good luck. She'll probably have teeth soon.|`|texgI6Hgaa	Firstly, put a stop to the chomping whether teething or not ! When you feel she is about to bite, quickly slide your little finger in from the side of her mouth, unlatch her and tell her 'no biting'. Repeat that a few times, each time she does it. Babies are very smart and she will learn quickly that if she wants Mommy's comfort, she will have to stop biting you.<br>  <br>  Also check to see if she is gaining enough weight and having enough wet diapers to ensure she is getting adequate nutrition and is not frustrated from being hungry. <br>  <br>  As regards to teething, yes she could be. My little one started teething around 6 months. The crankiness, night nursings are all a package deal with teething. Try having her gnaw on a washed frozen washcloth. My little one didn't care a tuppence about the fancy teethers I got her from the store. Try offering her other forms of comfort like snuggling with her more through the day. Don't lose hope. Things will get better !!
wi7Ern8Raa	I have had 2 already (1 just last month), so I asked my doctor the same question.  He said it varies from woman to woman, and depends on a lot of things like which direction your incisions run, how large/long they are, how easily or how difficult they healed, whether or not they were infected, how dense or thin the scar tissue is, etc. Basically there is no way to predict how many you can have, but at some point when you have one they'll say "OK, that was your last one".  My MIL had 4, and that was 20-30 years ago, but I also know a woman who had one and couldn't have any more.  Like I said, I've had 2 and am still OK for another one if we want to.  You'll just have to ask your doctor about your particular circumstances.  Good luck!|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	They say 3.<br>  <br>  But I work on the labour suite and have seen a few cases of ladies on there 7th C-section.<br>  <br>  It's not recommended but it can still be done.<br>  <br>  Doctors aren't a fan of anything to be honest other than surgical, in the hospital where I work Doctors would much rather give a perfectly normal woman a C-section than give birth vaginally.<br>  <br>  They believe in episiotomies. c-sections. epidurals - Not water births and aromatherapy. VBAC is ok!!<br>  <br>  But good luck no matter what you chose to do xx|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	they say 3<br>  <br>  because after that it can be dangerous.<br>  my neighbor had 5 girls......and she almost died in the 5 c-section.... so try not going over 3|`|aMpMFLo3aa	well I asked my doctor and he told me I can have up to 6 if I wanted to.. lol<br>  I am going on my 3rd c section.... |`|BFuYtDl2aa	Everything I have read says 3... <br>  <br>  However, a friend of my In-Laws is Catholic and doesn't believe in any form of birth control, and has had 10 kids all by C-section... No complications with any of them...|`|KCvrB08Caa	3|`|TQW5E6olaa	My ex- Mother in Law, had 4. The first in 1978 and the last in 1990|`|AykczQleaa	My sister had 4 all ok c sections.
0zWJlNi1aa	i found it useful for the early stage of labour - i put it round my neck with the cord - it doesnt need to clip onto anything|`|CuMYdQV6aa	I haven't used it personally (well, I'm a bloke!), but the hospital with which I am associated has recommended their use for over ten years now and patients report a considerable degree of relief. The devices were provided on the NHS so it is worth checking out with your local hospital.|`|qT3GrDRDaa	tens distracts pain to another part of the body, it is effective.  You get to put up the pain level to whatever you desire, and with some relief you can take it off or shut it off.   <br>  <br>  best wishes and prayers from an x tens user lol<br>  like Jesus said "For the pain of a woman in childbirth, it is worth it when she has the baby:" and "For the joy set before me that you may believe, I go to the cross set before me."  the gospels<br>  <br>  <br>  David in Jesus amazing grace|`|J1stiMioaa	i used one for my first labour, i got to 7cms before i couldnt cope anymore n needed something stronger, so yes it did help. it is also handy to have some1 to stick the pads on your back! most tens machines come with a clip on the back so u can clip it to your nightgown and they have a neck cord as well so if you are in the buff you dont have to clip it on anything! <br>  they also have a boost button which you press when you feel a contraction comming.<br>  i found it quite easy and i may have done the whole birth with it if i had known about the boost button beforehand! i decovered it about a week after the birth!|`|ed1fd474ffe907b183e2991c2f9b248daa	Yes, I had that and gas and air only. At one point the nurse said - 'you don't need this thing on' and pulled it off and within minutes I noticed and had it back on. So yes, for me it really helped|`|AA11716572	No, I'm a dude.|`|FGbwdKdhaa	Yes I used one. I hired it from my local hospital who gave a tutorial and tested it on me. This helps you to see what it feels like, a mild tingle.<br>  <br>  I held out as long as poss to use mine, I had a long slow labour and waited until about 12h before I gave birth.<br>  <br>  To be honest I can't say how well it worked because I haven't given birth without one but I would certainly use one again. It definitey gave me something to think about although the pain was still there and<br>  I ended up taking gas and air at 8-9cm so it lasted me for most of the labour!<br>  <br>  Because that's all I used and baby was well I went home a couple of hours later.<br>  <br>  Good luck with what you decide to use!|`|AA11422975	Yes, I used it in both labours, and I liked it.<br>  <br>  It helped take the edge off the pain of the earlier contractions, and later on I had it cranked up and it felt like a massage on my back. It didn't so much take the pain away, but it made me feel like I had some control, because I could start pressing the button when I felt the contraction starting, so I think it helped me feel I could do something about it.<br>  <br>  In my first labour I also used the gas and had pethidine, although in hindsight I asked for the pethidine when I had reached the "transition" stage where you hit a point where you think you can't handle it anymore (but that means your baby is close to being born!). The midwife should have checked my dilation, as I was fully dilated.<br>  <br>  In the second labour I used TENS from the start and had a few sucks of the gas, then asked for pethidine again when I felt I literally could not stand another contraction no matter what, but the midwife this time checked my dilation and said, "I can feel a head!! Your baby is coming out!" and freaked out because they weren't expecting it so soon.<br>  <br>  I found as soon as it was time to push the pain just doesn't matter anymore (I swear it pretty much stops! Even though obviously contractions continue).<br>  <br>  Both my labours were induced with oxytocin (first one I was 13 days overdue and second one my waters had broken two weeks early and I had a fever, and contractions were not progressing, so they wanted to give it a "push along").<br>  <br>  And another thing, I found all the talk was about labour and the newborn baby after that, but nobody had warned me how crap you can feel for a few days afterward.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I LOVED my labours and felt (and still feel) like superwoman for having done what I did! It's hard work, but it's also pretty awesome.|`|0ncRvBIgaa	I used Tens, it was rubbish. It didn't help at all. I had gas and air which made me want to throw up and then an epidural which made me not feel anything and go to sleep! if i was to have another, i wouldnt have any pain relief, its the only way you can control what happens.|`|3sifF0Tjaa	Absolutely! it can be painful but bearable. I did not have a completely natural birth. I had an epidural shot in my spine so I did not feel anymore pain during my child's birth. It made things a bit less painful but, not easier. I still had a hell of a time pushing that lil guy out!! he didn't want to come out!! lol|`|dmN74HpJaa	I used it with my 1st and i really didn't like it  as i couldn't stand anything on me, but my friend used one with 2 of her births and really rates them so i think it depends on the person. <br>  sorry i couldn't be more specific|`|UiwZQcpVaa	I asked this question not long ago and didn't get many answers.<br>  <br>  I have got my T.E.N.S Mach and am hoping to use that and then go into the birthing pool - and hope I wont need anything else.<br>  <br>  Best to keep an open mind on pain relief :)<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|ZA85JtJNaa	Soz, im still 15. and male.|`|unH9urhraa	no|`|b02c5b6b35c4e2dc8692b5442f2c4ab3aa	<a href="http://www.askbaby.com/tens-machines.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.askbaby.com/tens-machines.htm</a>
1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	it totally drives me crazy!! Like you said, why dont they call you by 'sister, daughter' etc?<br>  yes, i'm a mum, but thats not my only role in life, i am also a woman who is a person in her own right!<br>  I have a name-use it!!|`|b11d4406389c926e8457572221d6ce48aa	It used to annoy me, but I've gotten used to it. Now I quite welcome it. You need to chill, I think people only have good intentions when they call you that.|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	i dont know how to stop it from happening but i know what you mean im 19 and my brother is 3 so for the past 3 years when i have been out with him on my own people call me mum to him and it even got to the stage where he thought i was mummy and my mum was just mum its  not fair on him.|`|jShfNvQXaa	Oh I hate it too- I got it all the time when my sons were newborn then it calmed down. Its started again though because I'm pregnant again- drives me nuts, the worst thing about it is most the people who say it are parents themselves! Grrr!SAdly i think its just one of those things we have to grin & bear xx|`|LMc23g9Maa	Not really.  I don't care enough.|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	personally no one has ever said that to me so i dont really know if it would annoy me|`|neJbYkJoaa	I think it's meant as a compliment.  Mothers are honored on Mother's Day for all their sacrifices and hard work and love and devotion and beauty.  I think of that in a good way to define that I am doing something important in my life and it is very respected, I think.  It doesn't mean that you have to have that as a definition of who you are.  It's just PART of who you are and PART of what you do.  Some women can't have children and would almost "die" to be a mummy or mum.  I wouldn't over-analyze those little things.  |`|tuG72claaa	I know. You want to say. "I'm not YOUR mom!" Only my kiddies get to call me that! My daughter (I'll call her *Kelly) also has a friend who calls me Kelly's mom. For example, she'll say, "Hi Kelly's mom". It annoys me so bad that I had to have my daughter talk to her about it. Next time, you should call them something that defines them as well, for example, Hi waitress,  hi Grandpa, hi cashier, etc. Hopefully they will get the hint. I am, and I'm sure you are, proud and honored to be a mother to wonderful kids, but we are also so much more. We are sisters, daughters, friends, and neices among other things, but we are unique individuals!<br>  |`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Are your hormones playing up?  What's so wrong with it?  They are not defining you, merely saying what they see, and most people are pround to be new parents.  Obviously if they are random strangers they wont know your name either.<br>  <br>  Edit: How are they to know you have siblings or that you do art?|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	I don't think you can really tell them to not do that without being rude. Does it really happen to you all that often that it's such an issue? I'd say just try to ignore it.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I just overlook it.  They are just trying to be friendly and don't mean anything about it.  Life's is to short to get upset over little things like that.  :)|`|Kj84qLozaa	i did that 2 my friend the other day! she had a baby about 3weeks ago! oppps!!<br>  <br>  lol i liked it when i first became a mum! no one does it much nemore :-(!|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	I personally dont mind! If you don't like it then tell them in a "nice" way.|`|cWLEe3CSaa	say "i'm not your mom, child.."
d7kGopYxaa	yes i do, it sucks ): Shut up with the jesus crap!|`|DhZ5smpWaa	It's called being a teen, lol. And yes,  I do. I think a whole lot of people do, even adults I bet feel somewhat the same way. We're still young, we've haven't really gotten to experience life yet. I think once the doors to the world opens for us, out of high school, into college the out into the world of adulthood. Anyone who feels like that, will go and find what has been missing. Maybe, it wasn't missing at all, and it has been there right under your nose and you just haven't realize it yet =)|`|RRxlVNHQaa	well my family has lots of problems && so do i so i deffinatally fit in with them. oh && we all hate each other. its a funny group.<br>  i feel like sometimes my life could be a movie.<br>  i sometimes feel like i should have been born in the 70s && that i should live in a redneck area && not south florida..|`|4ZtAvYG9aa	I use to feel the same way, but that phase is now over. I have found the love of my life, and that void inside of me disappeared. His name is jesus christ, he saved me and i feel like a better person through him.|`|AA11634257	nope im a very complete person. i live my life to the fullest.|`|By1DJAUOaa	I FEEL THAT WAY 24/7 AND I CAN'T FIND THE MISSING PIECE I JUST DON'T FEEL COMPLETE|`|naPYuaDQaa	It's hormones, apart of being a teenager.<br>  <br>  When you feel awkward and out of place, when you're never sure of yourself and always concious of what you say and do and look like. When you want to run away just to see who will miss you, just to take a breather for a little while.<br>  <br>  But then things change, and you find out who your true friends are and family is going to be your rock, and someday you'll be able to be your own person living your own life.
3F8f1SoQaa	my friend had a rough labor and ended up having a c-section. she did not even want her almost grown kids to come to the hospital. What she did was have the nurses put a sign on the door saying that all visitors must check in with the nurses station b4 entering the room. When I went to see her ( legit business that HAD to be taken care of ) the nurse went in the room to see if she wanted to see me. If she had said no  they would have even called security to get rid of me if need be.  as for when you are in labor, most hospitals will only allow 1 or 2 people in the labor/delivery room. If he did show up and you did not want him there, they would tell him to leave and even have security escort him from the room if needed.|`|rmnvkIBXaa	you can tell the nurses who is allowed in your room. and tell your family that you dont want him there either. most parents will respect the feelings of their kids.|`|AA10952977	You don't have to have anyone in the hospital that you don't want there. If he ends up coming and trying to get into the room all you have to do is tell the nurse you are uncomfortable with him being there and they will ask him to leave. Labor is hard enough don't put more strain on you.|`|YYLF1BfSaa	Even if he does find out you are at the hospital and shows up anyway... nobody can come in your room without your permission.  Just set it up with the nursing staff ahead of time so there aren't any surprises.  But nobody else has the right to ask anyone to be at the hospital except for YOU.|`|XqfH76PMaa	You do not have to have the father of the child at the hospital and you do not have to list the father on the birth certificate.  If you do not want him there, keep him away.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	The hospital does not require the father to be there.|`|fjlzt6Ygaa	Nobody HAS to be there except you and your baby. In fact, the nurses have no problem kicking people out if you want them to. If having him there will upset you in any way I hope you will tell him to get lost. He can use his time alone in the lounge to think about what a dick he has been.
OjcYkqySaa	Instead of just running out to the ER, call your doctor.<br>  Only they can tell you what you should REALLY do.<br>  Not these people on here.<br>  Relax.

You maybe doing it wrong - but because you like him you'll practice more and more therefor getting better. Once you nail it like the other girl he'll probably ignore you aswell. <br>  <br>  I had an English teacher who was the same. My friend would write unbelievable essays and get 90%+ and i would be sitting in the 70% range and he would always say "Well done Storme, keep up the good work" and would just say to my friend "Good, Rox" and walk away. <br>  <br>  He wasnt creepy, he used it to build confidence. If he told me i was doing great, than i would put in more effort to be even greater.. Than once i was edging into the 90%'s he would just say "Good, Storme" and walk off.|`|tbeO3Lataa	Ohhhhh, yes. This has happened to me before. My biology teacher, 4-7th grade (he taught all of them...red flag much?).<br>  <br>  He did the same thing. Always called on me (and I was not an exceptionally interested student), always asked me to take things to his car, always made me a "volunteer" when he needed one, even if I didn't raise my hand. What did I think of it? Honestly? My creep-o-meter was flashing. The problem? He was hand-on-the-sholdery, but never touched me sexually. Not much you can do in this case.<br>  <br>  Is there any reason he would be favoring you? Do you know him out of dance? Do you know him better than anyone else in your class? If so, this could be why. It could be completely innocent. It could also be more. Just keep your guard up, and never go anywhere with him alone. He may be completely oblivious to his actions, too, so don't assume the worst.<br>  <br>  In cases like this, hope for the best, prepare for the worst.|`|ajDohnPIaa	Well i can't say this has happened to me. But i know other's that it has happened to. And it's YOU that the teacher thinks will be more succesfull. Unless it get's sexual i would be happy =]. and not saying it will! but, just incase. And be happy, your doing better than the others. And now they have you to look up to.|`|2QvIM81Haa	No. Btw, Allie.. you seem to attract a lot of teachers.. kinda creepy..|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	He could be a creeper. Watch out.

2jiNLOKHaa	my sister missed her peiod and got a positive pregnancy test. she went in for the ultrasound and nothing was there. it can happen. they called it a chemical pregnancy. the baby implants and that is how the pregnancy hormone is detected on a test, but then the baby died shortly after implantation. her body absorbed it and she had her period shortly after that.|`|EH6ExoV6aa	you can go to a free clinic like I did at 6 weeks. They did a urine test and an ultrasound after the test was positive. <br>  I also had a "chemical pregnancy" two years ago had two positive test and when I got checked by a doctor he just said your not pregnant I was a almost two months late. Take a test around the time your period is due.|`|BRXg8Mcpaa	If you think you might be pregnant, you need to see a doctor immediately. This isn't about expenses or convenience - it's about an actual LIFE.  You need vitamins and prenatal care as soon as possible.  <br>  <br>  Also, a doctor won't schedule an ultrasound just because you want to have one.  You have to have a reason.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Well at my first one it was so early they saw nothing but it wasn't because nothing was there...|`|qlcY8aKFaa	Are you talking about NOTHING?|`|8n3NvYQwaa	Yes I did but it was on my brain so there was complete and utter nothine
4a4956af54187297a464b66b57b91221aa	i think it is great and i think they should have started it sooner when i was in school! cause I thought i was dying for the first 6 months i had my period cause no one had ever told me what it was. and then one day in 5th grade we started Family life and they showed us (the girls) a tape about your period. and I was sooo relived my only problem with it was that i had had to suffer those first 6 months alone thinking i was going to die. (my mom thought she had plenty of time to tell me about it since i was only 9 and she didnt start till she was almost 15) <br>  my husband and i were just talking about this today cause now they start it in Kindergarden and we were wondering what they are going to be teaching our 5 year old. (i hope they teach him where babies come from i'm pregnant and i dont want him thinking i swallowed a seed and have a plant growing in me like my SIL law told him when she was pregnant!)|`|37eaaf04a170a9e7422959c1a87cc3caaa	5th grade<br>  that is around middle school and children should learn of course because they should how to act mature<br>  as if they dont know or say fu ck or i wanna suck her or something <br>  trust me society changed|`|1855bee1d2c3b513c76133b0128b3d9baa	I think it needs to be more detailed, in highschool but the younger students need to as well be told the basics about it. BUT if children knew more about Birthcontrol and condom use as 2 protectors then it would be easier on the world, as I thought I was safe with JUST birt control and was never told about the 3% chance of ALL birth controls failing or not working with your body!|`|60bd876bb3af3ea6aea5c8f067123d07aa	Hey,<br>  I think it's important to learn about sex and for kids to get all the facts about sex and about abstinence so they can make their own decisions.  I would start teaching that curriculum in middle school.  It's important for kids to get a consistant message from their parents, teachers, and community.  A&M Partnership is an organization that provides curriculum to use and speaks in schools too.  Check out their website for more information about the topic - ampartnership.org.|`|84f4e5fb81473de235592452fcf3c3a7aa	i'd say about grade 5 I also think they should teach about different body parts and different ways to have sex about stds and different methods of protection they also should say that abstinence isn't always the best way as long as you are truly ready and are safe in doing so|`|AA11563131	idk...puberty ed is in like 5th grade.....so ya i dont think we should even have it cuz most teens already kno a crap load cuz of being at skool....i kno alot mor than my mum thinks i do...u just absorb stuff :)|`|AA11900958	they need to teach about condoms and stuff before kids start doing it. i say 3rd grade|`|bc49c626d7a684768c5099a757c11e0faa	I don't have any children but I've been watching them forever. I was watching a 6 year old girl of a young mother one night. She wanted to  go out with her boyfriend. She stayed out real late so I stayed the night. Around  6 am. The girl comes down stairs. I tell her to go upstairs to her room until her mom wakes up. She told me "MY moms already awake." I asked how she knew. Her reply "she having sex."The girl knew what sex was to some extent in first grade.<br>  <br>  I also watched a boy once who told me slap braclets were called sex bracelets. If a guy slapped one on the girls' wrist it ment he wanted to have sex with her. He was 8 in the 3rd grade.<br>   The average age of kids having sex is getting younger and younger. I can't remember the exact age but I believe its like 11 is when a lot of boys start having sex and 13 is when girls.So between 6-8 grade the average kids has had sex. It sounds awful but with the world we live in Sex is shoved down kids throats they need to learn about it before they start having it. I'd say when a child is in the 3rd or 4th grade is a good time to explain it and the consequences of it.
VjLocbfPaa	really it depends on who you are ..........it might hurt badly but its<br>  all worth it once you have it , its like the most beautiful things to experience and if u got someone u love there holding your hand just forget about the pain and focus on how much u love them and the new baby but it depends everyone is a diff. person so everyones labor is different so ull probbly experience pain just ask for the pain medicine and it wont hurt as bad and just wait till ur married to have one so ull know that ull have someone there to help you with it !!!<br>  and remember always wear protection !!!!! its your mistake if you dont !!! =)|`|oIFMohfUaa	It is bad for some, and not too bad for others!  truly depends on your pain threshold.<br>  Then there are also so many things that they can do for you that will help take away pain.  <br>  I've had 5 and for some there was a lot of pressure, others a burning sensation.  The cramping was the worst, but then I had an epidural and went through the delivery with hardly any feeling at all.<br>  <br>  I hope I've helped...|`|GEOamw3paa	It's bad..really bad.  lol At least it was bad until the epidural.  I was getting upset because they kept pumping fluids in me and freezing me to death at the same time.  There is no modesty in labor either.  I don't know how many people came in the room and "checked" on me and I'm pretty sure they got the janitor to come give me the epidural. lol just kidding :) It's worth it though.  At first, it felt like little muscle spasms every once in a while.  Then after a little while, they came harder and lasted longer with fewer time in between.  That was severe cramping where basically I tried to breathe and gripped the bed railing until it stopped.  It felt like my entire body was locking up.  It's the craziest feeling.|`|1IDSGM71aa	The last few minutes of contractions is all that hurt really bad for me. I took an epidural at 9.5cm lol. It didn't have time to work, so I had a natural birth (which is what I'd wanted originally, but I was so tired and hungry after being in the hospital and in labor for three days that I was having trouble breathing through contractions). The pushing hurt WAY less than the contractions. I mean, it hurts, but not as bad as I thought it was going to. Honestly (sorry if this is TMI) the rectal pressure was worse than the vaginal pain. The baby's head numbs you because of the pressure. I tore and I hardly felt it because of the numbness.|`|Vad64Jjoaa	Honestly it hurts, I had an epidural and you can still feel pain, just not as bad.I literally couldn't walk from my house to the car and then from the car into the hospital (hubby had to carry me and then I had to have a wheel chair, she was crowning). I would suggest the epidural definitely! But as time passes you forget the pain. My daughter is 5 months and I forgot how bad it was until I read this question. It is worth it in the end. |`|KHVEK3aRaa	Imagine the worst cramps you've ever experienced.<br>  <br>  <br>  Make them longer, more powerful and come more often.<br>  <br>  <br>  Contractions are one big cramp. Not to mention the baby sometimes rubs against nerves coming down the birth canal, and can hurt in your legs or back as well.|`|vsGtzWR8aa	I don't know personally, but I asked my mum and friends and they say 'helluva lot'. It's the greatest pain they've encountered so far. That's why I ain't havin' babies lol.|`|LBjRXESIaa	My wife says, She did natural labor. The actual birthing was not hard. It is the contractions that are the hardest part of giving birth. If you do research, you will find that standing up or kneeling up and rocking back and forth are a few of the best positions in getting through the contractions and the delivery. Ricky Lake did a wonderful documentary on giving birth. I would recommend you look for it on net flix or on line. There are many myths in the Americanized versions of birthing. Remember, Pediatric Doctors are schooled as surgeons which is why we have so many c-sections in the States. The best advice is to do research and not only in the USA. Don't worry about the pain until you feel it. Be aware so you can work through it. Remember many women have given birth and lived through the pain. It is a moment for women to claim their super powers. congratulations and good luck!|`|ZIzXc7j0aa	I had a c-section and it was the easiest thing ever!!! <br>  <br>  after I gave birth I was bleeding (as all women do) but I had a blood clot the size of a baseball pass through my vagina (sorry TMI)<br>  It hurt so bad!! I was thanking God I had a c-section!! <br>  <br>  It felt like i was  torn down there ... It was horrible I admire women who have natural child birth but sign me up for another c-section over vaginal any day!! <br>  <br>  Id have a c-section just for fun... |`|2t3vS3sraa	OK I was terrified of giving birth because of the pain,  to the point of wanting to be hypnotized. I went into labour before my appointment though. All I can say is it took less than an hour and I had no pain relief and no stitches, mostly it was like really really bad tummy and lower back ache. Everyones labour is different. I met one lady who loved the feeling of giving birth!|`|eaec21d021a64de69faee82b4c03247eaa	For me, the contractions were more painful than the labor! But I was getting drugs through an IV :( Personally, I'd not use the drugs, because it made me fall asleep, and after I woke up, the contractions were worse. If you hold out on the drugs, your body will adjust and "accept" the pain as it strengthens. I can say this now, but once in labor, the pain makes you want anything!|`|XqfH76PMaa	If you have an epidural, there isn't a whole lot of pain.  If you feel anything, it will be discomfort.  Without an epidural, it is pretty painful.  You literally hurt from your chest to your knees and pretty much feel like you are going to split in half.  |`|QM6wiVtVaa	It's not something you can describe accurately. The only way you are going to know is if you have been through it.|`|Ex8z59I5aa	I'm pretty sure it hurts prettttty bady.  But, I'm sure you knew that?|`|7823c88a25415e1b637f82bb9e175c56aa	Don't choose "natural child birth"...if they offer meds...TAKE THEM!!!|`|lW37oGQbaa	It will hurt bad, worse than anything u have ever known. God's gift of a baby has a wonderful affect though. The joy you experience overshadows the pain and due to the intensity the brain compensates by allowing  you to quickly forget that pain. It has to work like that other wise no woman would ever risk unprotected sex after having a child for fear of that pain again. Plus modern medicine will ease alot of pain, Dont forget God will not give you more than you can handle|`|mwuOaNLcaa	It really hurts, but you focus on the purpose of the pain and it is bearable, anyhow, once you have a baby in your arms, the intensity of the pain seems to fade away, you only realise what it was like the next time you are close to giving birth|`|5PGO71Uraa	everyone can tell you it hurts like hell and is the worst pain ever. which honestly it is but you really have to experience it yourself cause there is no word to describe the pain.|`|0MZuQoRsaa	worst pain of my life. but once the baby is out all the pain goes away and all is wonderful.........|`|h1iMtz2Qaa	Get the epidural!  Natural childbirth is one of the most brutal things that can ever happen to you.|`|ZHGzWggCaa	try shoving an 8 lb chicken or turkey UP your vagina, and then you'll have it all figured out.|`|fNOYBhY7aa	BAD|`|rGY8uhgxaa	like shatting a bowling ball|`|077jY06taa	the most horrific pain you will ever, ever EVER experience!! but worth it!|`|H0oRbaF1aa	i don`t know!but my sister was pregnant?
906c850695e1c05505ced54a17b66cb8aa	It is hard to say for all women but you can kinda figure out yours by tracking your personal stats. Or you can go to a web site that does the math for you, you just have to give it the info.  Like uh..fertilityfriend.com  That one is a good one.|`|5a30d2d2ba29d4643def3f23b0fc523caa	do you really need to post it on the internet?|`|05e7e6107e274991038415d7bd2bdbdcaa	there are ovulation charts online you can figure it our with. Go to babycenter.com and you'll find helpful hints on trying to conceive. For me it was about two weeks after the first day of my period. I bought an ovulation test and it tells you whether or not your ovulating. Two weeks later I bought a pregnancy test (because I was late with my period) and boom, I was pregnant. A month later I found out I was having twins!!<br>  Good luck!|`|f251e311d225a8e13e84d87fc10c0d41aa	Usually 14 days from the day you are going to start your period! not after the first day of your last period a good source is asl Dr. Amy .com...usually when you have discharge that looks and feels like "egg whites"
fJiUa5ykaa	This may not work for you but I figured I could tell you what we do in the foster home I provide respite for.<br>  <br>  When we have a toddler that refuses to leave his diaper on during the day, we put him in a pair of Carter's one piece pajamas, but we put them on backwards.<br>  <br>  They can't get them unzipped when on backwards so they can't take off their diaper, this is done at home during the day and night if we have too.   Of course they wear normal clothes when they leave the house.<br>  <br>  We've even cut off the legs at the knees on Older pairs of pajama's, so they can wear them over their day clothes during nap time since that's when they are most likely to take off their diaper and unfortunately end up "painting" with their diaper contents!  |`|GY4yYB6jaa	Your best bet would be poppered wraps or nappies. Starbunz Wraps have poppers <a href="http://www.fill-your-pants.com/product/76/8/starbunz-nappy-wraps" rel="nofollow">http://www.fill-your-pants.com/product/7...</a> so do the MotherEase Airflow <a href="http://www.fill-your-pants.com/product/13/8/motherease-airflow-snap-cover" rel="nofollow">http://www.fill-your-pants.com/product/1...</a> and you could use both over your Bambino Mio's. He wont be able to undo those!<br>  <br>  The Mio's arent all that absorbent though for older children, I stopped using them about about 4 months I think. So another option would be to go for a different type of nappy, such as a Tots Bots <a href="http://www.fill-your-pants.com/product/46/6/tots-bots-bamboozles--poppered-fastening" rel="nofollow">http://www.fill-your-pants.com/product/4...</a> or even some Pocket Nappies which are FANTASTIC and many come with poppered fastenings! <a href="http://www.fill-your-pants.com/section/18/1/stuffable-nappies" rel="nofollow">http://www.fill-your-pants.com/section/1...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Oh Lord! I use bambino mio and also call my son houdini as he regularly manages to wrestle his way out of a velcroed kiddopotamus swaddle wrap! If I have that to look forward to then great!<br>  <br>  Can't you do up the mio backwards, as far as I can tell its the same both sides except for the velcro?|`|YHySXRJtaa	Haha. Try fastening the nappy with duct tape, cut into strips (pull some out from the roll and then cut it off _across_ the tape, about an inch from the end of the tape. Nice manageable sized strips. Fasten them tightly. Nappies are supposed to be tight.<br>  <br>  P.S. Perhaps there's something uncomfortable about these nappies that drives him to wrestle out of them. Check for rashes or reactions, but it does just sound like he's a strong willed young fellah. :)|`|F63yZgkRaa	lol mine were the same...once they got old enough to see you do something once...youve had it!!dont think that theres anything much child proof anymore as the kids are all growing up so quick,sorry

AF0crtCRaa	My ex- girlfriend had a daughter, and when it got time to potty train we just had her go to the bathroom often.  Whenever he mother would go pee she would go.  We bought he a Dora pot and put it in the bathroom and just constantly reminded her.  Whenever she had an accident we would remind her to go to the pot.  Another thing we did was get her out of a diaper quickly, we started buying pull ups, then slowly went to regular pantys.  I think girls are easier though.  This is what we did, it didn't take long at all, I don't think she liked being wet at all so she quickly learned to say I gotta go pee.  |`|11t7PuwKaa	Both my son and my daughter were easy. Before they could walk, I started holding them over the potty in a reclining position when they need to go. I knew when because I noticed the signs or they made a sign with their hand (around 9 months old). When they started walking (around 10-11 months) they knew about the potty because I had taken them there every time they had to go and they just knew when they feel it, they go to the potty. I helped them with clothes and they did great. By their first birthday they were potty trained and it took a few more weeks to remove the night diaper which I only used just in case.|`|AA12306103	my son is 2 and a half... and refuses to use his potty and only wants to use a toilet... which is fine... but it was frustrating because i couldnt figure out why he wouldnt use his potty.<br>  he sits on the toilet like he would the potty, and does his business... however, i still have a little ways to go as he wont do #2 in the toilet LOL<br>  sometimes around the middle of the night, i take his pamper off, sit him on the bowl and ask him "do a pee-pee for mommy".. and he does..in the day, i let him run around either bare-bum or in a breif... he lets me know when he needs to pee by grabbing himself and ill ask him if he wants to go, he says yes, and then i sit him on the toilet.<br>  when he gets a little taller, ill get a step stool for him so he can use the toilet properly... dont want him to get used to sittin on the toilet LOL<br>  just be patient... he did wet himself a couple times, but he doesnt do that anymore after ive let him run around.<br>  your child will let you know when they need to 'go' ... theyre all different.<br>  |`|XqfH76PMaa	My daughter was easy.  I just took her to the potty with me and she would sit down on her potty and try until she got it.  My son, on the other hand, is two and could do it if he wanted to, but will not do it.  If you get any good advice, I would love for you to send it my way!  Good luck!|`|4gZYucHMaa	I believe waiting until your kid is ready, not when you are but when they are, is the best method, they'll get it sooner.<br>  <br>  With my daughter I tried her at the year, she wasn't into it. So 6 months later I did the same thing and she got it day one.My daughter was a breeze, there was no training. As soon as I brought out the undies and potty she was trained @ 18 months. One accident when she ''peed'' herself made sure that she got on whenever she could---I was lucky bc she was very particular about being ''dirty'' even in play.<br>  <br>  Now my son on the other hand,I also waited until he was 2 because he showed no sign what so ever of wanting to do it and bc of his stubborn nature I knew it'd be a battle so we took it slow,  required ''rewards''--food rewards. Everytime he went on the potty I'd give him one smartie. He got it within one week fully including nights.<br>  <br>  With both my kids, I had the potty book I'd read to them, reward stickers and explained what was to be done kind of like how we have to clean our teeth, wash our bodies, I let them know that now that they're 2 it's time to use the potty, no more diapers and I had their size potty chairs and was relaxed with it.
tbeO3Lataa	You need to tell someone. You cannot go through it alone. Believe me, I've been there.<br>  <br>  It's funny, I was just the other day talking to my youth minister about something similar. I don't know how it came up, but I asked him in what cases he has to keep information confidential, and in what cases he has to tell someone.<br>  <br>  I am sorry to say that in any case someone is harming themselves or others, all confidentiality is gone. You could do serious harm to yourself, hon, and no cutting is "not that bad". However, that being said, he does not necessarily have to tell your mom, it could be someone else.<br>  <br>  Either way, please tell SOMEONE. You do not have to go through life like this. I promise.|`|DhZ5smpWaa	Go and tell your pastor, you need to tell someone. Cutting is not a good habit to get into, and you need to stop it. You can trust your pastor, I'm sure of it. Actually, I think you he'd be happy you came to him for help.|`|x1qKGmzSaa	yes tell him! also tell him if he tells ur mom to help her understand. explain it all to him. she should know so she can help you. but if someone else tells her, then she'll have more time to process and everything. and im sorry :(|`|fRs4nUdVaa	I was a cutter if you want confidentiality Use the yahoo messenger email is Kellikatastrophe1022 Im always on.

You really need to tell an adult you trust and respect.  You also need good, professional help to get through this.  You deserve good help, at least i think so<br>  <br>  You might also find helpful information and meet others who self-injure and who are trying to work toward change by doing a yahoo search for Self-Injury Forums.  You might make some friends, get questions answered by people who have been through this themselves.... maybe  meeting others through forums and even chatting would give you the confidence to seek help for yourself, hon.<br>  <br>  i hope  you will try the search.  take care, and if you need assistance finding more information, message me. i am happy to help|`|GRdK217aaa	well from one cutter to another, get help NOW!!!!!!! your young and if you dont stop it will get worse, iam a cutter and so is my best friend, when i did it for the first time i was about 15 and i told my mother she was upset and did not understand, iam now 29 and i still cut, the last time i cut it was about 6 months ago, i cut on my leg that time, over the last years i have gone from cutting my arms to cutting my back, legs, ankles and even my face at times, i wacthed a program the other day showing a girl of about 14 cutting and it scared me, i thought wow that could be my daughter, i cryed, my daughter is only 9, getting help is very inportant, if you feel like you cant tell your mother then go directly to your doctor they can not tell your mother and you can get the help you need, i have scar's all over my body, and the first time my boyfriend saw them he asked what they were, i did not tell him until it was 2 late and he found me slicing my leg up, it scared him a lot, what iam trying to say is people are afriend that when we cut we will die, and it is possible, i had cut once and i almost bleed out i was found by my best friend, get help and i hope you stop cutting, sadly its a pain that goes much deeper then the skin i know|`|3buQDaRDaa	Why are you cutting yourself?

eTPJNcilaa	Sometimes cervical fluid will have a light brown or pink in it during ovulation, which can be left over blood. The best way that I know I am ovulating is that my cervical mucus will be extremely slippery and abundant, clear, and stretchy like egg whites. After ovulation it is less noticeable and sticky. Did you check your mucus about 11-14 days after the start of your last period?  That is when your most likely to ovulate.I ask this because a few days before my period I get a light brown color.|`|2jiNLOKHaa	if you have the egg white like cervical mucus then you are probably ovulating. i have had a little bit of ovulation spotting before. it was the month i came off my birthcontrol. it can happen
FgnJ6X2laa	I don't think that he liked you more than a friend. He probably just answered you because you were loud, and he knew the answer.

KRQtXHwIaa	I think this is a very normal fear for all parents.  I have four children and can't imagine it now any other way. You will be amazed how that love in your heart just seems to grow with each one.  I came from a large family ( I have 5 siblings ) and I wanted that for my kids. As an adult I love and appreciate my siblings so much. I know that my parents won't be around forever. You will know in your heart what is right when the time comes :)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I dont know as of yet but I will in about 2 and a half weeks yay for me lol I have the same fears, that I wont be able to love this baby as much as I love my first son. It just seems like I love my son sooooo much how in the world would I be able to have enough love to love someone else as much. But like with everything our hearts grow and expand and its just one of those things that happen. You probably missed the one on one time with your parents bc you were so much older then your brother. I was two years apart from mine so I dont really even remember what it was like before he came along and I'm 5 years older then my youngest brother. So I think that makes a difference how big of an age gap there is.|`|xt3zR0Uyaa	I am a young mom and I have 2 beautiful kids a little over a year apart they are 1 and 2. it's hard to have two so close together but it is worth it you might have more of an attachment to your first child for a while but it wont last long at all. your love grows as your family does. you went through allot with the fertility treatments and wanting a baby but it was worth it. If you are willing to do it again  then I would go for it you will never not have enough  love for another child they are a blessing.|`|bUDcM8Q3aa	I have ten kids from 14 down to 8 months and four under the age of 4 and I love all my kids with every ounce of my being and can not imagine it any other way. How many family members , mom dad aunts uncles, grandparents do you have.... you dont love them any less cuz theres lots of them. Why should children be any different. The Lord blesses us with the ability to love one another freely and with children it is easier to love. Good luck.|`|GRdK217aaa	well, i think its normal to feel that way, i have 3 girls and my oldest is 4 years older then the other 2, she does miss the one on one with me but also loves her sisters a lot, i think its in how you show the child that your love will always be there and that even if you have another child it makes a happyier home, being a mother is wounderful and being a big brother is great too, iam a big sister and i love my brother, my mother shows us she loves us in diffrent ways but nun the less she loves us both equaly
ea72c7eed7b6ed1d64dace91975e8213aa	Its when the doctor cuts you open from your vagina to your anus so the baby can slip right out. <br>  <br>  I've had two kids vaginally and never had an episiotomy. It's only used about 30% of the time (thats what I read somewhere).|`|GjtoWGClaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309224134AAalErX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|cnK4X2sZaa	the doctor cuts your perineum... skin around vag and anus... owwweee to help you deliver "easier."|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	They cut you so the babys head can fit.. then they stitch you up.. Its quite common.|`|1sHrGRcXaa	An episiotomy is a surgical incision through the perineum made to enlarge the vagina and assist childbirth. The incision can be midline or at an angle from the posterior end of the vulva, is performed under local anaesthetic (pudendal anesthesia) and is sutured closed after delivery. It is one of the most common medical procedures performed on women, and although its routine use in childbirth has steadily declined in recent decades, it is still widely practiced in Latin America and in Poland and India.|`|2jiNLOKHaa	when the skin around your vagina is to tight and is making it hard for the baby to be born, sometimes the doctor will cut that skin so that the baby can pass. then stitches it up afterwards.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	It's the cut they give you between your vagina and the anus in the part thats called the perineum.<br>  You don't always have to have it, they will do it if the baby is having trouble coming out.

I have since then decided against getting him circumcised.<br>  <br>  When he had to go it, we were allowed to give him water or pedialite after 12. Call and ask the hospital, because babies are a little different than adults. They NEED to have something to eat every so often.<br>  <br>  Good luck~|`|K4zsztkRaa	I will tell you something, circumcision greatly disrupts sleeping habbits for babies, circumcision is very traumatizing.<br>  Most circumcised babies refuse to breast feed and they scream and cry more and they don't sleep very well.<br>  The reason for the breast feeding thing is because after a baby has been in that much pain they no longer want to bond with their mothers. Which I wouldn't either, and I didn't after I was circumcised. I still don't bond with my mother because of it.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|CzKrqgmgaa	thats strange... my son wasnt supposed to have any bottle 1.5 hours before his circ was done... 6 hours seems pretty extreme, especially for an infant that is still used to getting a 3am bottle... <br>  i would give them a call and make sure they really meant midnight or maybe they can change your apointment to 9 am if that works better with his feeding schedule|`|YCJz2DiWaa	I'm not saying don't get it done, but can I know know why you're getting it done at 6 months. I didn't know they did that.|`|AA11987492	Good news! You don't even need to get it done!<br>  <br>  No, there is NO reason to have a child circucmsied. As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...<br>  <br>  I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the penis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis.... they are the ones that are missing parts<br>  <br>  One of the worst things you can do as a mother, is give your child cosmetic surgery to make them "fit in". Basically, you are saying, there is something wrong with you, you had to be fixed, and you should base your self esteem on what others think of you". Actions speak louder than words you know. If you are doing it because "That is what everyone else is doing" All I am going to say is, don't ever say no to your kids when they want to do something that is harmful to their health and they just want to fit in. Kids come home drunk or high? No problem, they just wanted to be "normal", You don't want them to be teased do you?????<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Boys can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision|`|EwmHsEoiaa	I'd recommend against getting it done.<br>  <br>  Watch this video, called "The circumcision decision"::<br>  <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-5395565256830319025&ei=si6cSZCZMYnojgKZmcCUDg&q=nocirc&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?doci...</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin has a function.  It contains many specialized nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability to masturbate easily as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  There are good reasons to believe that sex is better for the woman as well, if the man has his foreskin intact:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  Care for an intact boy is easier.  Just a few things you should know:<br>  The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth (they have to break this seal to perform the circumcision - this is excruciatingly painful - not that the pain is the worst part of circumcision ) <br>  You should never pull back the foreskin or try to clean under it.  It requires no care.<br>  The foreskin should be left to become retractable on it's own , it should not be forced.  The foreskin becomes retractable by itself.  this occurs any time up until the end of puberty, though the average age is 5-10 years.  Until then, nothing to do.  A lot of doctors are not familiar with this - don't let them retract it.<br>  Once it becomes retractable, there is little care - just wash it like any other body part.  It is not dirty - if it was then women would be a lot dirtier.  Most men worldwide (75-80%) are intact and have no problems.<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/</a><br>  <br>  Circumcision carries a lot of risks:<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision.org/cac_complications.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision....</a><br>  There is also evidence that the pain and discomfort of circumcision disrupts the mother-son bond and also breast feeding. Some evidence suggests the trauma of circumcision has long-term psychological effects.<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldman1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldma...</a><br>  <br>  It isn't recommended by any health organisation.  Some studies point to a mild health benefit.  but it really isn't sufficient to cut of a healthy body part that has a good function.  Only 25% of the world's men are cut and 2/3 of these are Muslim.  Men in Britain France Germany and Italy all do fine.

That straightened me out in a hurry! <br>  <br>  <br>  Not the easiest thing I'm sure, but it did work for me.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Two words: Boot Camp.<br>  <br>  Looks like you can afford it.<br>  <br>  <br>  All these other people have NO clue what it is like to raise a problem child who DGAF about anybody else and try to blame it on parenting.<br>  <br>  Nip this in the butt before he turns 18 because it will only get worse.|`|b3YMLS61aa	Military school. for the little bastard|`|LisP31O8aa	I don't think this is a valid question.  <br>  <br>  This is the first question you have asked and you just joined YA today ?  People who give $1500 dollars allowances don't exist and IF they do, it's not on YA and they'd never acknowledge it if they did.  Same with the other 'stuff'.   <br>  <br>  Your grammar doesn't sound like the parent who would be able to give a kid all these things that you list here either... ..... somebody in that money bracket would have a family psychologist and psychiatrist on retainer and that's who they 'd to to for help, not YA.  You are a faker.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	No he is spoiled rotten. I'm sitting here reading this and thinking wow, cell phone car xbox and a 1500.00 allowance. He is spoiled. at 15 I was living on my own working going to school paying all my own bills. I had to get my own car which was a 1972 impala I called it the flying booger lol yes it was green and awful lol. He is very lucky that you guys his parents are giving him all that. I would tell him ok buddy you go..go with her, but when your face ends up in the dirt we will see who was actually right. He will come crawling back on his hands and knees bc where else is he going to get a car,cell phone,xbox, and 1500 bucks a month. I would tell him you can take the clothes on your back but since you are under age and we bought all of this stuff you arent taking it. See what he does then, its called tough love mama.|`|uqjEXAOmaa	sound like you did a crappy job of parenting in the first place by giving him everything he wants<br>  <br>  a $1,500 allowance ?!?!?!?<br>  <br>  <br>  spoiled rich kids always turn out like that<br>  <br>  @damien and aleenas mom: kinda late, but wtf do you know what we know or not?|`|06wcIi76aa	Well, I'm not sure if sending your son off to military school (or pawning him off anywhere else for that matter) would help him much at all. Stop and think for a minute. Peer beneath the skin and see what's on the other side. Since he's 16 years old, I don't think the punishments you give him will hold water. Sit down with him. Talk to him. Try to understand him. More than anything, that's what he needs from the both of you right now. Look at it from his prospective, but set the ground rules VERY CLEARLY! Compromise with him. Family counseling may be a good idea as well. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped. Good luck.|`|d7ihBw4Qaa	Honestly, i have been in rebellious stages and I know how your son feels he wants a certain sense of freedom that he feels he isn't getting from you. Maybe loosen the reigns a little bit and let him make his own mistakes, at least in the process you wont lose him and he wont like move in with this girl or something. I am not saying let him get away with murder, lay down certain rules you have in your house and have a family meeting where you all sit down and discuss these rules that he needs to abide by and give him some sort of say in these rules as long as they are legible. Let him know that he isn't restricted from everything in sight and that he has some sense of freedom. I wish you the best of luck.|`|lmk3mKJgaa	MAYBE SOME TOME IN JAIL WOULDNT HURT HE MAY STRAIGHTEN UP AND COME TO HIS SENSES. IF YOU GROUND HIM AND REALLY STICK TOO IT IF HE LEAVES YOU FOLLOW, BUT I AGREE TELL HIS GIRLFRIEND AND FRIENDS IF THEY EVER COME AROUND YOUR HOUSE THEY WILL REGRET IT. IM NOT SAYING ITS YOUR PARENTING CUZ I HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE THAT WERE SO STRICK WITH THEIR KIDS AND THEY KNEW WHERE THEY WERE AND WHO THEY WERE WITH AND STILL BECAME GRANDPARENTS. ITS NOT ALWAYS THE PARENTS FAULT. SO FOR SOME PEOPLE TO SIT THERE AND SAY WE HAVE NO CLUE, GROW UP. YOU DONT KNOW ME OR MY FAMILY|`|vAM1GhBiaa	Lol yeah 1,500??? Money didn't solve the problem in the begging. You need to discipline him good stand taller than him. My parents kicked my sister out when she was 17 and I don't talk to her but I could care less. If he says that he won't listen to you guys put him in his place and tell him when he is in the streets begging for money you guys won't be there for him. Just send him to Military school. This happens to the rich a lot! Us poor people get beat up lol kidding.
etWY35Z8aa	why r u getting so many piercings? <br>  your a dude! |`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Uhm, tongue piercings are definitely not attractive, especially when you have a ton of other piercings along with them. Just ask them I suppose, you'll have to let them know eventually. Lol, I seriously just now heard "Can a tattoo or piercing cost you a job?" on the news! Of course piercings are not permanent but I don't know why you would want to get that many. Course it's not up to me to judge. <br>  <br>  Just talk to your parent's.|`|tzcfc2lWaa	that might be because getting your tongue pierced is much more dangerous than getting your cartilage pierced. your tongue could get all kinds of infections and then you wouldn't be able to eat.!

XqfH76PMaa	I am so sorry that you are going through this.  The only thing that is going to help you is time.  You are going to need time to heal.  I think it is best you stay away from her.  She doesn't seem to care about your input in the relationship and was very cold hearted about the baby.  I think you deserve better than that.<br>  <br>  As for the recovery time (I do not support abortion either), I do know someone who had an abortion at 16 weeks.  It was basically the same situation.  She was at the clinic for about 5-6 hours, came home, went out to eat that night and went to work the next day.  I assume it isn't considered a major thing as surgery goes.  Personally, I don't understand, but a lot of people who do it seem to function find within 12 hours.<br>  <br>  Again, I am very sorry about this.  I hope you move on and find someone you can be happy with.  Someone who will care about your feelings and include you in all aspects of the relationship.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	She is a heartless wench!!!<br>  <br>  Not just for keeping the existence of pregnancy from you.  But also, breaking up with you because of it.  Also, Her flip-flop behavior.<br>  <br>  She is probably blaming you for the pregnancy....how typical!!!!|`|m0DgqEcjaa	It is possible for her to have one in that time period|`|kZfYaS4oaa	dump that girl only a mean mean person can kill a baby she never deserves to get pregnant again! I hope she goes through life without the ability to have another baby!|`|44uorNhOaa	it is possible to get in and out that fast i was in there for just like 4 hours or so i had no bed time i went to work the next day. see if she is bleeding cus i bled when i was done. <br>  it is screwed up how she did you and i wonder if the kid was your to begin with. how did she pay for the abortion they are not cheap and exspecially that far along. ask for a reciept.|`|JF343E2Taa	im so sorry she aborted ur baby and im sorry she has hurt u so much i know u love her but what shes doing to u is cruel and unhumanly i think u deserve alot more and leave her yes it will hurt but in a month 2 or a year u will be happy and move on i hope u meet a girl who will treat u good u sound so sweet and caring good luck|`|RcKQYqJeaa	Like I told you in your other question... I'm sorry, but until they make it illegal, things like this will continue to happen to the good men out there like you.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that she wasn't woman enough to own up to what you two had created out of love.<br>  <br>  I hope in the future you find a woman who will love, honor and cherish you and your love together, and through that love welcome a baby with open arms into your lives to start a family with that love.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck.|`|ItG88e6iaa	okay this is the 3rd time im gonna answer your questions and now at this point i believe ur either making the story up as you go or u just really need to seek medical help. |`|Udq1S1mQaa	she might be feeling guilty for deciding to go through with the abortion and finds it hard to be around you because it would be a constant reminder of what you two could have had. her reaction is odd to me actually. i would think that women who have gone through the termination of a pregnancy will want even more support from their loved ones instead of driving them away. have you considered the possibility that she may not have been as faithful to you as you think? well, i hope you recover from this trauma and be ok.|`|oeEZZeQvaa	I'm sorry your girlfirend did this without really consulting you.<br>  I know someone who had an abortion at approx 7 weeks, and was back to work the next day, so I assume it's possible.<br>  She should take it easy though. I know from having gone through post-partum, that your body needs time to heal.<br>  <br>  And as for you...I'd have a serious heart to heart with her. If you still love her, I'd suggest getting some counceling to work through your grief, and trust issues. Good luck to you both.
qBAcsddFaa	I don't think your first would be twins, but i'm sure sometime down the road if you kept having kids you would have twins. You could take fertility drugs and be gareenteed multiple births.|`|AA11764194	Tricky question..you wl know only once you get pregnant<br>  <br>  we don't hv any twins in our both families but all my pregnancies are Twins..<br>  <br>  so no guarantee that you wl hv twins |`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Hard to tell.  My dad is a twin as well and it seems to skip generations.  Now, my dad's twin brother's son had a son, then a daughter, then twin boys.  So for him it didn't happen till pregnancy 3.  On my dad's side, I had a baby she was my first and only so far, not a twin.  My brother is also having a baby and it's just one boy.  So maybe twins will come later for my brother or I.  Either way I'll be happy :)|`|yznZqcznaa	No one on here can logically tell you if you are going to have twins because there are factors that play into it.  For one, the twins on your dads side of the family, were they fraternal?  Your dads twin cousins were they from the females in your family or were they from the men, your uncles.  If they are not from the females in your family then it has nothing to do with your gene pool.  If the set on you family is identical then it has nothing to do with your gene pool either. <br>  <br>  Only fraternal twins born to females in your family, could be passed down.  <br>  <br>  Note: when I say females in your family I mean... Your dads SISTER would have to be the relation not your dads BROTHERS kids.  If the family tie is female then there is a chance you can inherit the gene.  I also think only the mom can pass the gene.  So it does no good even looking at your dads side because he does not carry the gene for ovulation your mother does.  So take all the factors, look at your MOMS side of the family and then you will see what your odds are.|`|m2aznd8xaa	yes you can have twins and your more likely when its every other generation.i have twin brothers and was told that its more likely  with every other generation but i still have the possibility.also the older you are the more possibility because you produce more eggs|`|66tTuuIFaa	There really is no definite way to tell if you are going to have twins BUT with that many twins in your family, if you are open to have more than one or two children then I'd say you have a very high chance of eventually becoming pregnant with twins.|`|MFSxgZspaa	there's a big possibility that you can have twins|`|TqkDGL67aa	I'm not sure of the exact percentage but it is true that it skips a generation. Identical twins are random, fraternal twins are genetic. I found this website and if you read down it says 'how to have twins'. In my opinion you're probably pretty likely to have twins<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://multiples.about.com/od/pregnancy/a/familytwin_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://multiples.about.com/od/pregnancy/...</a>|`|L3h2xO1laa	yeah most likely because your dad has a dominate gene for twins and u said it skips a generation. and your g-ma is a twin so u are most likely to have a twin son/daughter!<br>   That is awesome!

I hope you are open to the possibility!  lol  Good luck!|`|h6M4hajPaa	Yes it is very likely you would have twins.If it is in your blood then yes.|`|TS0bMiVWaa	twins are only common if  it runs in your family and if thats the case then you will have twins |`|oeEZZeQvaa	I've heard that twins run in families. But only fraternal twins. |`|c10NnI6Haa	The odds are 10/1 that you're a rabbit.|`|b9C8BAlIaa	The fact that twins run in your family increases your chance of having twins, the older you are increases the chance too...and the more pregnancies you have definitely increases your chances. |`|JmtiWRzyaa	Your father being a twin is a good sign that you could have twins too.  In fact, most people who have twins without fertility treatments have twins that run in the family
bW1X9haUaa	Every woman and pregnancy is different. I am 36 weeks and 4 days and I have never had morning sickness hope i can go 4 more weeks without....lol|`|XqfH76PMaa	Yes, it can happen at any time during your pregnancy.  It is nothing to worry about.  
DhLIo8nbaa	It is a terrible thing but your body knows if you have a viable fetus in your body, and if the body is spontaneously aborting the baby then there really is nothing the hospital can do, so they do usually let you go home and be comfortable in your own home.  It is a terrible thing though, I will keep her in my prayers.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	I would have her call her doctor, or get a second opinion from a different hospital not in the area.  I had a miscarriage at 16 years old and I was there for 2 days.  They like to keep close attention with those kinds of things because a lot can go wrong.  |`|mIUjnujeaa	Did they do an ultrasound? It could have been a subchorionic hemorrhage. I had that from 7 weeks off and on but I was pregnant with triplets and lost them at 16 weeks back in april. If it is just a SCH there is a good chance the baby can make it with light bedrest it is when a part of the placenta detaches and forms a blood clot. Have her get a 2nd opinion.|`|97Fr4s6Waa	The hospital I went two the first time sent me home and off my feet. Second time, said I was fine that if I was miscarring there isn't anything they could do. Next day went to another one and I told them that I was a Possible Miscarriage. I told them what I went through at this other hospital and they said We'll do something. I asked the first for an ultrasound, ER doc told me too soon. I told my husband if the second hospital didn't do anything for me I was going to go how ever far I'd have to go to get my answers. There isn't anything you can do but let nature take it's course. Make an appointment with Dr to get checked or go back to the ER. |`|XqfH76PMaa	The same thing happened to my sister.  I am assuming that sometimes they can't do anything to stop the miscarriage and just send you home to let nature take it's course.  I am really sorry to hear that this is happening to her.  |`|iKkpskPtaa	I recently miscarried and they had to do blood tests and an ultrasound <br>  if they havent at least booked an ultrasound i would say that they are being negligent and she should go get a second opinion|`|PVMZZvhHaa	I experienced a similar situation during the beginning of my pregnancy. I had spotting so the Dr. sent me for an ultrasound, and after a "pubic examination" decided that I was experiencing a miscarriage. They sent me home expecting to "pass" the tissues. After not passing any "tissues", another ultrasound confirmed that I was not having a miscarriage. God was with me! All the Dr. could do was apologize. I was very upset, but thankful at the same time. My suggestion is to get a second opinion from another Dr. & prayer always helps too! Good Luck & God Bless! |`|NDNZqupEaa	Hi there:<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that your friend's sister is having issues with her pregancy.  As a mother, I can understand how frustrating it may be when your concerns are not clearly addressed, especially during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The hospital should have done an ultrasound to see if they could still detect a heartbeat before they released her.  It concerns me that they just told her that her pregnancy was going to end up being a miscarriage without confirming whether or not there was a heartbeat.  <br>  <br>  Your friend should go to her prenatal doctor (ob/gyn).  He or she will definitely take care of her.  |`|sL7ewdUoaa	You should have her try a different hospital she is 12 weeks along into her pregnancy ..although spotting is normal and it is best that she puts her feet up and don't do any physical work.. when in doubt check it out.. meaning get a different opinion to be sure.. she is pregnant and needs all the special care she can get.. take her to a different hospital to care for her needs.. it is better safe then sorry|`|ytobBcataa	The hospitals in my area are the same way.  I was pregnant and had been spotting and went to the ER. I went back a few times because it kept getting worse but the baby was ok.  I also knew I had a UTI but they sent me out anyways so I went to Bethesda where it was confirmed that I did have a UTI.  When I was 15 weeks I was gushing blood at night so I went to the ER again, at another hospital and they said everything was fine.  Said the placenta and baby were fine.  At 16 weeks two days, i delivered my baby boy still born.  Genetic testing confirmed nothing was wrong with him but that the placenta was messed up, and I knew it from the start.  I nearly bled to death in the ER with the same doc who said the placenta was just fine.  Retards.  SO YES, I would recommend getting a better doctor because something could really be wrong and you may never know it. Especially if shes young, doctors and nurses are prone to spending less time with you because they are stressed, backed up or having a rough day.  <br>  <br>  Though if a woman is under 20 weeks, they wont send her to L&D if shes having contractions or bleeding. They will normally diagnose it as a possible spontaneous miscarriage, but a good doctor would also do blood screenings and an ultrasound to make sure things are in place and to look at the placenta, etc.  Again, I would recommend she finds a better doctor.
AA11726810	hey hun you can tell when your baby's nose start to run, his eyes brows might look pinkish if he has a fever and the rims of his ears as well. he will be a bit more fussy and want to be  held a lot more.

They intend to start to sneeze and occasionally have a little cough and sore throat also. If you feel as though his symptoms have gotten a little worse u should take him to see his doctor. Just so u know ahead of time when he receive his shots next week be sure to get the doctor to prescribe some infant tylenol cuz babies intend to run fevers and get extremely irritable. But ask the doctor ahead of time and they will surely tell u what u would need to do.|`|00s31I4Eaa	when he coughs or sneezes more, or if he is really warm or if his nose runs a lot|`|AA11845810	Babies are just like bigger kids when it comes to getting sick, the only thing is, babies cant talk. Babies tend to cry and show you what is wrong through body language. You can tell if your baby has a cold if he/she runs a temp, coughs/sneezes more or has a runny nose. Sometimes the mucus has a greenish or yellowish color to it. Since your baby has not had his/her shots, I can see why you are worried. In most cases, once babies get their shots, they usually will run a low-grade temp. Baby Tylenol will make it go down. Good luck.|`|8PXu8rNdaa	when it has AIDS
NzKpmxB7aa	First of all, I'm so sorry you're going through all of this...<br>  <br>  I'd look into hiring a birth doula, and a postpartum doula, whether or not you decide to go for that home birth.<br>  <br>  Many doulas who are in training will charge little to nothing for the experience.  Look on dona.org, cappa.net, alace.org, and a few other websites to find a doula in your area.  You may have to call the organizations to find a doula in training who will charge less.<br>  <br>  You CAN do this.  You ARE doing this.  I'm inspired by your strength :)|`|25IpWLoxaa	you have definitely been through a lot, and it shows.<br>  you can do it, for sure.<br>  if your boyfriend left you, and lied about where he was going, hes a real loser.<br>  (just had to get that out of the way)<br>  you're going to have SOME stress, no doubt about it.<br>  but you just have to stay strong, ok?<br>  don't let things get to you and try to be strong about it.<br>  im sorry, i don't have any real advice about your situation because I haven't had a child, but i really wish you the best.<br>  good luck hun.<br>  things WILL get better.<br>  |`|6cd2b9806708d36519bb71225b088c16aa	well first off ur story made me cry I am so sorry about your fiancee. I'm 11 weeks pregnant and I am so afraid of loosing the baby. but u have gone through a lot and u are still strong especially if ur having a water birth OUCH i could never do that Lol but if its what u want then more power to ya. for the stress try yoga or Pilate's good for stress relieve. I'm not much help with the midwife but i would try and go online and do a search i wish u well and good luck u can do it |`|IiZxmACRaa	First let me say im sorry to hear about your past. That must have been a hard time. But...on the brighter side, you are about to have a beautiful baby girl!! I was wondering about what kind of government help your state may offer? I found out I was pregnant with my daughter (who is now 6) when I was a pizza delivery girl ! Needless to say I didnt make enough for the costs of pregnancy. So I took advantage of medicaid and they helped me SO much. You can save money now, and use medicaid for your prenatal checkups and delivery (no its not for trashy people with 6 or more kids lol.) <br>  You will be fine just take it step at a time and get the support where you can. You are very strong to take on teaching, being preggers and raising your sister. Hope this helps :) Good luck hun! <br>  |`|aac0a258712d1293b7bdc3ec55e1af65aa	Ok. You make a plan. Try to prepare for every possible hurdle and more besides, because the more prepared you are the better you will be able to handle what is about to happen. You are already a high risk pregnancy, so you have to be very careful to watch your stress levels. But telling you this isn't helping right? You need some definitive answers and a plan of attack so that you and your daughter can have a better life than what yours has unfortunately been recently. <br>  <br>  I think you should talk to someone who does employment counselling, or financial planning (I don't mean someone who charges money, not an investment firm...I mean a community service professional who will see you for free and give you advice). Look for programs in your community, try to find a professional advisor or counsellor who can actually point you to local resources that can help. I'm not sure what they might be called there...maybe a family resource centre, something like that? Try every avenue and don't give up. You've had a real bad run and it sounds like it's about time for your life to turn around. You are obviously doing the best you can with what you have, and believe it or not that makes all the difference. You will get through this, you will improve things, it just might take a bit of forethought and a lot of determination. |`|pvRH2F5paa	Luna...<br>   i want to let you know that God is there for you, i know this is all very hard for you, and you might be feeling like you are alone and nobody cares but just remember that most of the time when we go through the most troublesome times of life and we only see one set of footprints, and god is supposed to be walking right beside us, but we don't see his footprints is only because he is caring you. <br>  <br>  *you are not alone*<br>  |`|ANHsv4ENaa	You sound like a strong, amazing woman. Since you can't find a midwife make sure you get a doula!! I know that will help you so much since you don't have a partner. I know it's trite but keep strong faith that you WILL be alright and your baby will be alright and things have a way of proving you right.|`|c63c1a8a3f313613d03647643c55dd58aa	You came this far...You can do it....Be DETERMINED.........Be STRONG......NEVER give up.........<br>  Check the State laws where you now reside, and Federal laws as well.  I thought you are allowed up to 12 weeks off for Family Leave, but not sure of the timing when you can begin.|`|03f0f1539dba8cbdea713128f3cea720aa	Look at the past and look at where it led you. You are so strong to be making it through what you have made it through so far, I know you can do it.|`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	You will amaze yourself at how much strength you have when you need it!|`|DlipUzKAaa	You have been thru so much, your are a strong woman.  Dont give into your fear.  When you let the fear in, you let your faith out.  You have gotten yourself thru more than most people will in a lifetime and your only 26.  Just believe in you, this baby is a blessing just dont forget that.<br>  <br>  There are alot of programs you can apply for, wic, food stamps cause you are guardian of your sister and pregnant, and see if you have a crisis pregnancy center near you, they offer all kinds of help for struggling mothers to be, best of luck to you and DONT GIVE UP GIRL!!!|`|r1KS5GsDaa	ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR BABY EVERYTHING WILL COME TOGETHER. I AM A 19 YEAR OLD SINGLE MOM OF A BEAUTIFUL ALMOST 3 MONTH OLD BABYGRL. HER FATHER STUCK WITH ME THE ENTIRE PREGNANCY AND THEN WHEN I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL HE STOPPED TALKING TO ME OUT OF THE BLUE. HE HAS NEVER SEEN HIS DAUGHTER AND DOES NOTHING FOR ME OR HER. IM GETTING READY TO GO BACK TO WORK IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS AND DONT REALLY HAVE THAT MUCH HELP WITH WATCHING HER SO I HAVE TO PUT HER IN DAYCARE 2 DAYS AND THEN HAVE FAMILY WATCH HER THE OTHER DAYS. POINT IS ONCE YOU HOLD YOUR BABY EVERYTHING WILL BE PERFECT FOR THAT MOMENT. YOU WILL DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE YOUR BABY HAS THE BEST LIFE POSSIBLE. I STILL CRY AN FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF BUT AS SOON AS MY BABY SMILES OR WAKES UP I PULL IT TOGETHER AND AM STRONG FOR HER.<br>  YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO DONT WORRY.<br>  GOOD LUCK AND CONGRADULATIONS. <br>

sYsfI856aa	If the swelling doesn't go down or worsens then you'll want to go in. It could be a sign of preeclampsia, which can be severe. Usually it doesn't happen til later around 37 weeks but can happen earlier. Check your blood pressure if you can, if it's high you'll want to go in (one of those machines at a pharmacy will be good if you are out and see one, check it). <br>  <br>  Otherwise, cut out extra salts from food, try to eat a low sodium diet, keep laying on your left side to help improve circulation, and keep well hydrated. If this swelling is new or extreme to you, don't wait, just go in and get checked out. Never hurts to be safe.  <br>  <br>  If it goes away within a couple of hours, then that's normal, my doctor also suggested warm baths! (just no bubble bath)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Swelling is normal, especially in your stage of pregnancy.  Sleep on your left side for better circulation.  Also, I would recommend a low sodium diet.  Both of these work well for edema during pregnancy.|`|paCHaDWVaa	I don't think you or your baby are in any kind of danger, when I was pregnant my doc told me not to wear my rings unless I wanted them cut off lol. Maybe try having someone massage your legs and feet and arms? That could help. If it doesn't go away by morning you should call but If your really worried it never hurts to call the doc asap to ease your mind, that's what they are there for. Good luck.|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	you should go to the er cos major swelling in pregnancy might be related to you kidney. you better check it out now|`|1WiLNzgPaa	I had a serious issue with my feet swelling during pregnancy as well. Sorry to say, the only thing you can really do is elevate your feet to relieve the discomfort a little. The same with prickly skin. Nothing much you can do about it; just wait it out. Water may help lessen the swelling in your face a bit, but don't expect any miracles. The best thing to do is relax and make yourself as comfortable as possible, as stress does not make the situation better. I actually had to purchase new shoes during my pregnancy--one size larger. <br>  <br>  Good luck--and it will be better soon!
484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	No. It's fine.<br>  With O negative the mother sometimes needs a Rhogam shot if the father has a different blood type because she doesn't have any antigens.

CJkrXeDgaa	organic simply refers to the way the ingredients were grown and processed. Yes, organics are better for us...but not all organic ingredients are right for a baby.  <br>  EX, you can buy organic honey, but it's not recommended that you give a baby honey.  <br>  Baby products are made especially for sensitive skin.  If you are wanting to give your baby organic products, you should probably still buy baby organic products (ex, burt's bees)|`|zReKPmgJaa	As long as your baby doesn't have any adverse reactions, you can apply lotions to your baby.  I was putting lotion (Johnson & Johnson) on my baby as early as a week old.  Unfortunately she has sensitive skin.  I now use Eucerin on her (recommended by the pediatrician).  If you are unsure just call in your question to your pediatrician.  They can give you the best advice as to what types of lotions you can use on your child.|`|rqdc5ySYaa	Organic is the latest crazy really in everything , from clothes to baby food ! If the packaging contains fresh ingredients, for sure stick with the well known brands i.e Johnson and johnson. <br>  Be careful if any rache persists and stop if does so.<br>  Organic is for the good in my opinion.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	please buy some lotion made for a baby's very sensitive skin; try your organic stuff later on when baby isn't so sensitive...|`|01Mu3wUeaa	No.<br>  <br>  Use Organic baby lotion.
d6Uncd6iaa	I would say she probably chokes os salivia, or spit up. My son did the same thing, I bought him a memory foam pad they sell in the baby section in any department store, and i cannot remember what it is called. but it is in a clear and purple bag with a zipper. In any case, it looks like a wedge when you unroll it and you put her head up at the higest point and it goes down her back. This elevates her that if she does spit up it will come out and slide down her chin. She will be a bit messy in the morning, but it is better than having to worry about her all night. Those pads sometimes come with a small sound box built in that makes wome noises. I know it sounds uncomfertable, but it is really soft and comfertable.|`|j7XijtWFaa	yep same for my daughter from birth but she settled down midwives told me it is their immature muscles in their throat area  (can't remember right names etc) causes milk/saliva/mucus to come up. i either lied her on her back or side and tilted the cot/bassinet up so she was on a slight slope head higher than rest of body. You can get special blocks to put under the cot feet can't remember what they r called.<br>  saying all that is is still a bit stressful to her them choking just check her always and pick her up if it gets bad bang her back lightly and make sure nothing is caught too bad. settle her and put her back. it should settle if not by a reasonable amount of time see a doc or pediatrician.|`|aZRTTPn8aa	Have a three month old and found that this happened when she layed on her back (as they say to do).  Lay her on her her side.<br>  <br>  Also if you can try to burp her when you switch breast that helped my baby girl did this a lot in the beginning and the pediatrican said she may be getting air in when she latched onto my breast and also helped her to know she had to sources to eat from (ouch when both are not used).|`|UDc9C3Qmaa	I had the same problem when my daughter was a newborn. I found it easier to use a wedge in her crib. It still ables you to lay her on her back, but it props up a little bit. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bnocheckout.com/ProductImages/25004.1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bnocheckout.com/ProductImages...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  or you can read the details here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4631165" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  I also agree with Toi about the air getting in when she latches on. Burping does help out a lot.|`|rqdc5ySYaa	Hey . I can't give you any medical advice but being a father of an 8month yr old best answer is to see your doc asap !! Just the safest bet.

It is sold as:<br>  <br>  Chew – This is a leafy form of tobacco sold in pouches. A person keeps the chew between the cheek and gums for several hours at a time. It is also known as ‘a wad’. <br>  Plug – This is chew tobacco that has been pressed into a hard block and placed between the cheek and gum. <br>  Snuff – This is ground-up moist tobacco sold in cans. It is usually placed between the bottom lip and gum. It is also known as ‘dipping’. <br>  Spit tobacco can be as addictive as smoking cigarettes. A person who uses 8 to 10 dips or chews a day gets the same amount of nicotine as a person who smokes 30 to 40 cigarettes a day. Spit tobacco is flavoured with licorice, mint or cherry and sweetened with sugar. However, spit tobacco has over 3000 chemicals including 28 known cancer-causing chemicals, such as formaldehyde and cadmium. <br>  <br>  People who use spit tobacco are at higher risk of:<br>  <br>  Mouth cancer, including cancers of the lip, tongue and cheeks; <br>  Cancers of the throat, sinus, and stomach; <br>  Heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure; and <br>  Dental diseases, including receding gums, tooth decay, stained teeth, and chronic bad breath. <br>  Cancers of the mouth can develop within five years of regular tobacco product use. Only 56 per cent of people with mouth or throat cancer live more than five years after the time of diagnosis.<br>  <br>  Cigars, cigarillos, and pipe tobacco <br>  Cigar smoking is a trend among youth due to marketing efforts that portray cigars as glamorous and less dangerous than cigarettes. Cigarillos, or small cigars, are also popular among youth. These can cost less than cigars and come in a variety of flavours such as strawberry, peach and watermelon. Cigar smokers may spend up to an hour smoking a large cigar that can have as much tobacco as a full pack of cigarettes.<br>  <br>  People who smoke cigars are at higher risk of heart disease and conditions that make it harder to breathe, particularly for those who inhale and who smoke several cigars per day. <br>  <br>  People who smoke cigars and pipes face a higher risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, oesophagus, as well as lung cancer.<br>  <br>  Bidis<br>  Bidis, or beadies, are thin cigarettes of tobacco wrapped in leaves and tied with colourful strings. Bidis are popular with youth because they are cheaper than regular cigarettes and are sold in a variety of candy-like flavours such as chocolate, cherry and mango. Because bidis are wrapped in a leaf rather than paper, youth may believe they are a safe, "natural" option to cigarettes. <br>  <br>  While bidis have less tobacco than regular cigarettes, they are unfiltered and can have higher levels of nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide. Bidis do not stay lit easily, so people who smoke them need to puff harder and inhale deeper into their lungs to keep them lit. <br>  <br>  People who smoke bidis are at higher risk of heart disease and cancers of the mouth, lung, stomach and throat. They are also four times more likely to suffer from chronic lung infections. <br>  <br>  Kreteks <br>  Kreteks are Indonesian cigarettes made up of tobacco, ground cloves and other additives. Teens believe that Kreteks are safer than regular cigarettes because they are often marketed as “natural tobacco”. This is misleading because “natural tobacco” can be as dangerous as regular cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Kreteks have the same health risks as regular cigarettes, but they have more nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide. People who smoke Kreteks are at higher risk of acute lung injury and have up to 20 times the risk of problems with lung function. <br>  <br>  Are these products just a fad and who is using them?<br>  “Natural tobacco” is a new trend among youth. The products are often used by youth and marketed as more natural and safer than regular cigarettes. Flavoured cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are popular among youth. These can be cheaper than regular cigarettes and may come in candy-like flavours that appeal to youth who might not otherwise start smoking. <br>  <br>  While more studies are needed on alternate tobacco use in BC, tobacco control workers and health care providers are aware of an increase in the number of youth who are trying these products. <br>  <br>  Effects of Tobacco Smoke<br>  Smoking KILLS<br>  <br>  Every year hundreds of thousands of people around the world die from diseases caused by smoking.<br>  <br>  One in two lifetime smokers will die from their habit. Half of these deaths will occur in middle age.<br>  <br>  Tobacco smoke also contributes to a number of  cancers.<br>  <br>  The mixture of nicotine and carbon monoxide in each cigarette you smoke temporarily increases your heart rate and blood pressure, straining your heart and blood vessels. <br>  <br>  This can cause heart attacks and stroke. It slows your blood flow, cutting off oxygen to your feet and hands. Some smokers end up having their limbs <br>  amputated.<br>  <br>  Tar coats your lungs like soot in a chimney and causes cancer. A 20-a-day smoker breathes in up to a full cup (210 g) of tar in a year.<br>  <br>  Changing to low-tar cigarettes does not help because smokers usually take deeper puffs and hold the smoke in for longer, dragging the tar deeper into their lungs.<br>  <br>  Carbon monoxide robs your muscles, brain and body tissue of oxygen, making your whole body and especially your heart  work harder. Over time, your airways swell up and let less air into your lungs.<br>  <br>  Smoking causes disease and is a slow way to die. The strain put on your body by smoking often causes years of suffering. Emphysema is an illness that slowly rots your lungs. People with emphysema often get bronchitis again and again, and suffer lung and heart failure.<br>  <br>  Lung cancer from smoking  is caused by the tar in tobacco smoke. Men who smoke are ten times more likely to die from lung cancer than non-smokers.<br>  <br>  Heart disease and strokes are also more common among smokers than non-smokers. <br>  <br>  Smoking causes fat deposits to narrow and block blood vessels which leads to heart attack. <br>  <br>  Smoking causes around one in five deaths from heart disease. <br>  <br>  In younger people, three out of four deaths from heart disease are due to smoking.|`|AA10441180	Well, gee. I can only answer this from my personel experience... I have emphysema(?) I am down to 35% lung capacity. Would you like to wrap a towel tightly around your face and then try to do something? Anything? Try it. Forget runinng, walking fast, sex, exercise, self defense. Next time you take a deep breath slap your hands over your mouth. Experience suffocation (That is how I will die!) Gasping like a fish out of water. Oh, did I mention that with loss of oxygen comes loss of circulation in your limbs...leading to 'amputation!'

ab87b62835440d759cc0f901ce9490c0aa	Yes, all baby, placenta and amniotic sac are made of only one fertilized egg. It has always seemed so incredibly amazing that a whole baby and the whole mechanism for bringing it into the world comes from only one cell. That's what shows God's power and glory. Anyway, to your question - the moment the spermatozoid penetrates the egg their chromosomes combine together (they each have only half) and your baby's DNA is set for life. It's already decided if it's going to be a boy or a girl, what hair and eyes it will have, how tall or short, what temperamemt it will have and so on. Then the ovum (the fertilized eggs) start to split and at the same time it moves through the Falopian tube to the uterus where it implants itself in the uterine wall about 7 to 10 days after conception. If implantation is succesful, you have a pregnancy. Then the ovum becomes flat and separates in three layers of cells which form different parts of the whole mechanism. If you want more details, just check an Internet site on baby development. As for twins, if they are identical, nobody knows why one ovum splits in two to form two identical babies, with one placenta. It just happens. If babies are not identical twins, it's because two eggs were released and fertilized and got implanted separately from oone another.|`|eECytyckaa	ok that is allot of info and i don't want to type that much but get the video In the Womb it is a national geographic video it explains all of it|`|PxmwzEZFaa	if u are in school look in a health book or look it up in the library..it explains it all detail by detail|`|TnNMUKrtaa	sexual intercourse|`|kPyVTLRKaa	when a guy "sperms" inside of you.. theres something that they call "swimmers" and that attatches to the vulva( i think thats the word for it).. and swims in it and grabs on and then your vulva closes.. and i guess thats just what makes a baby. and yes your right if the egg splits, that's when it makes twins. <br>  .. i had a big lesson on this last semmester.. and i've forgotten alot about it... if this information isn't completely true.. then i'm sorry..:S<br>  i hope it was right though!|`|tChsy20xaa	1 sperm cell fertilized 1 egg.

Le risque, c'est de changer d'activité tous les ans pensant qu'elle n'est pas adaptée à ses go?ts alors qu'en fait, c'est son jeune age qui l'empêche d'en profiter pleinement.

CcPYRgNyaa	Ciao, sono una mamma di tre bambini. Alla mia terza gravidanza mi è stata diagnosticata una malformazione alle vie urinarie, che aveva talmente compromesso il mio bambino da essere ritenuta incompatibile con la vita. Io amavo così tanto questo bambino che ho scelto di accompagnarlo fino alla fine. Così facendo ho lasciato spazio ad un miracolo che è avvenuto, inspiegabilmente per la scienza. Oggi mio figlio ha 3 anni e mezzo. Ha subito 4 interventi, ha perso un rene, ma sta benissimo fa una vita normale ed è la gioia di casa. Non sempre finisce così bene, me ne rendo conto... da quando ci è successo questo, io e mio marito abbiamo messo su una Associazione che accompagna le famiglie che di fronte ad una diagnosi di terminalità, scelgono l'accompagnamento. Percorso eroico, pieno d'amore, ma sicuramente in grado di lasciare dentro di voi tanta pace e serenità... questa pace non ce l'hanno coloro che scelgono di uccidere.<br>  Da più di due anni operiamo in rete, gratuitamente, in collaborazione con l'equipe di terapia fetale del Gemelli di Roma, e altri centri in tutta Italia. Le nostre coppie (oramai più di 20) portano avanti le gravidanze sostenuti da altre coppie che hanno già fatto il percorso. Non sono mai sole. Ricevono telefonate, visite, messaggi, e interagisscono sul nostro sito come dei veri fratelli.<br>  Molti di noi si spostano in tutta Italia per essere accanto alle coppie in attesa, nelle fasi del parto, o anche del funerale di questi bambini, che riteniamo dei Santi.<br>  Accadono cose meravigliose, madri e padri che rimangono sereni di fronte alla morte, che sono portatori di pace per chi sta accanto a loro, e portatori di autentiche conversioni spirituali.<br>  Ti testimoniamo che si può fare.<br>  Cerca il nostro sito www.laquerciamillenaria.org è tutto scritto lì. La nostra Associazione è La Quercia Millenaria Onlus <br>  Non prendere decisione affrettate, non sei sola, e quello che ti sta accadendo, che vi sta accadendo non è un evento di sola disperazione. Dai spazio e voce all'amore che senti gridare dentro di te, l'amore per la tua creatura, che è stata pensata così, che è stata pensata per voi, sin dall'eternità.<br>  Auguri, spero tanto che ti metterai in contatto con noi. Se desideri parlare proprio con me, chiama il 320-8010942 io sono Sabrina.<br>  Dio vi benedica.|`|1QnZFni2aa	Carissima sorella, in Cristo Gesù, in Colui che tutto può…<br>  Lo hai detto e scritto tu stessa: come faccio a “uccidere” un cuoricino… che batte? Che è vivo? Infatti, a mente di mamma, non è possibile! Se, il Signore ha permesso tutto questo, è perché vuole che si faccia la sua Volontà, con fiducia, con fede! Prescindiamo tutti che nell’atto del concepimento, già esiste la vita, una creatura, un’anima, che anche se si uccide il corpo, NON morirà mai!<br>  Tieni la tua creaturina, che Dio, ha voluto che partecipassi anche tu alla sua creazione amorosa! Non commettere l’errore di… ucciderla! Lacsia stare i medici, sono essere umani, e la maggiore di loro, senza cuore, senza amore, dato che si credono loro stessi, poverini… dei dio! Ti riposrto una frase della sacra Scrittura che è Parola di Dio, poi, vedi tu… sei liberissima di fare ciò che vuoi, ma … ricorda che tutti, assolutamente, prima o poi, andremo incontro al Giudizio, di Dio!<br>  Non confidate nei potenti, in un uomo che non può salvare.<br>  Esala lo spirito e ritorna alla terra; in quel giorno svaniscono tutti i suoi disegni.<br>  Beato chi ha per aiuto il Dio di Giacobbe, chi spera nel Signore suo Dio, creatore del cielo e della terra, del mare e di quanto contiene. Egli è fedele per sempre (Salmo 145)<br>  In Gesù e Maria<br>  pino<br>  picap_55@yahoo.it|`|nRuOl4iwaa	Cara Frik,se il cuoricino della tua bambina batte ancora,batte per lottare per poter vivere,per cui lotta anke tu per lei,in 2 siete più forti,non si sa mai per un'eventuale miracolo!

Con me ci sono tantissimi altri che ti sono accanto e che pregano per te e la tua bimba. Coraggio, vai avanti. Non solo è doloroso uccidere una creatura ma è anche un omicidio.

Ciao|`|ykP4CyFkaa	Certo che questa è una scelda davvero difficile da prendere! Ascolta io ho un'amica a cui è successa la stessa cosa...e ha scelto di non interrompere...ma col risultato che comunque ad un certo punto il cuoricino si è fermato! Puoi immaginare il male che è stata...anche per il semplice fatto che più passa il tempo e più ti leghi alla creaturina. E' una scelta che sta solo in te e al tuo aprtner...pensateci bene e fate la scelta giusta....eventualmente chiedete consiglio e informazione a qualche medico in più. Coraggio & Buona fortuna|`|zFgFFMkeaa	Ciao, io sono infermiera.<br>  Non so dirti quante volte si facciano errori in medicina.<br>  E potrebbe essere anche il caso della tua piccolina.<br>  Non interrompere la gravidanza, dai alla tua piccolina una possibilità.

Anche se è una cosa razionale analizza i pro (anche se non ne vedi molti)e i contro...è stupido dirlo ma t'assicuro che è l'unica cosa da fare: ascolta il tuo cuore e qualsiasi cosa decida di fare non colpevolizzarti...mi dispiace molto...anche se non ti conosco sento che vivi una situazione che ti fa sentire cedere il pavimento sotto ai piedi. Ascolta te stessa...prima di ascoltare gli altri. Spero di averti aiutata anche se non credo...pero' c'ho provato perchè la tua storia mi ha colpito.

Credo sia una decisione da maturare in due.<br>  Qualunque cosa tu faccia, in bocca al lupo.|`|IiJzdfdDaa	a volte i miracoli succedono.. se é arrivata fino a 21 settimane un motivo ci sarà, non credi?non mollare vai avanti.se poi dovesse andare male avrai la certezza che hai fatto il possibile.e poi non credo che quel cuoricino che batte non ti abbia emozionato neanche un po'.tanti auguri facci sapere, un abbraccio.|`|WXHGj2Iuaa	vai avanti se ce la fai, può darsi ke lasciar fare alla natura il suo corso porti qualkosa di speciale|`|Wf6gm08Naa	Vai avanti,non smettere di lottare e credere nel miracolo della vita!Se la tua bambina non ce la farà,almeno non sarà per via di una decisione così difficile e sofferta che hai dovuto prendere tu,che poi credo che per quanto tu possa capire che FORSE è la cosa migliore,dentro di te,questa forza non la troverai mai!Sei sua madre già da adesso che vive dentro di te e la mamma,per difendere i propri bambini,lotta con i denti,quindi non arrenderti,i miracoli esistono e non è detto che questo non possa esserlo,poi anche la tua bambina sta lottando,hai visto,è arrivata a 21 settimane ed il suo cuoricino continua a battere forte,forte!Cavolo com'è difficile questa situazione,spero che tutto si risolva per il meglio!Ti faccio tantissimi auguri,dal profondo del cuore!|`|c6bf6d913f3f48f22ab2baa177374bdaaa	Non decidere tu della vita della tua bambina... se dovrà morire, morirà comunque purtroppo, ma non essere tu il suo carnefice! Pensa che rimorso avrai per tutta la vita... ti chiederai per sempre: "E se invece fosse sopravvissuta??". Non toglierai mai questo dubbio atroce dal profondo del tuo cuore...<br>  Pensa che se si fosse trattato di una figlia già nata ma destinata a morire per un brutto male, tu l'avresti assistita amorevolmente fino all'ultimo istante, non avresti di certo accorciato i suoi giorni! Fa' lo stesso, fino a che la tua bimba è viva, e non c'è dubbio che lo è e che percepisca tutti i tuoi sentimenti, falle sentire quanto la ami, quanto desideri che viva e che nasca per potervi stringere l'una all'altra, quanto la vorresti per sempre con te, quanto sei convinta che lei, con un miracolo di Dio, può farcela, quanto la accetti ugualmente, sebbene "malata"... lei lo sentirà, e se dovrà morire, succederà serenamente per lei, perchè seppur nella sua breve esistenza, ha conosciuto il vero amore, quello della sua mamma (e del suo papà spero), quell'amore che non conosce limiti umani... rendila felice, credimi, può esserlo!<br>  <br>  E poi... io non conosco questa malattia e come si presenta e cosa comporta, ma il mio cuore mi dice una cosa: non fermarti alla scienza, perchè non è infallibile. Fermo restando che anche di recente c'è stato un caso in Italia di una bimba alla quale era stata diagnosticata una gravissima malformazione, al che la mamma ha deciso per l'aborto, e poi si è visto che la bambina stava benissimo e non si è riusciti più a salvarla... a parte tutto ciò, che può succedere anche se è raro, ma poi che ne sai? Non può succedere un miracolo? Non tutto quello che la scienza esclude è impossibile! Sai perchè? Perchè nulla è impossibile a Dio!! Io penso sempre ad una storia VERA che ho letto in un libro di Padre Pio: una bambina che, per un miracolo, vedeva pur non avendo le pupille; ed ancora quella bambina, ora donna anziana, vede. Come si spiega? La scienza cosa dice? Nulla, perchè non è onnisciente. Non sa, si ferma.<br>  <br>  Un consiglio? Non uccidere la tua piccola creatura, rivolgiti direttamente a Dio Padre, chiedendo l'intercessione della Madonna che tutto ottiene a chi ha fede, e se è un disegno di Dio, la tua piccola vivrà contro ogni previsione. Non è forse incredibile che sia arrivata già a 21 settimane? E chi ti dice che non vivrà molto di più? Pensaci... se vuoi scrivimi in pvt... io, da parte mia, chiederò a tutte le mailing list cattoliche (il che vuol dire migliaia di persoe) di pregare per te e per la tua bambina. Dio ti assista, aspettiamo tue notizie<br>  Chiara|`|1ZZw5nGeaa	ti sono nel cuore...ti posso consigliare di portare avanti la gravidanza, anche se hai l 1% di possibilità che la tua bambina sopravviva provaci!!!io ho dovuto abortire perchè mio figlio era già morto, e il dolore è stato grande, mi sn sentita in colpa...figurati se sapevo che era ancora vivo...io ti posso dare un consiglio,poi sei te che devi decidere!!!fammi sapere se vuoi<br>  in bocca al lupo|`|gvzsYfvLaa	come ha detto reginetta la speranza è l' ultima a morire, quindi lasacia stare quei dottri del ***** e dedicati a tua figlia !!!!!!!|`|1iGv3ZO5aa	io credo che se ti senti di portarla avanti prendi questa decisione e vai.....sai a volte la speranza e la fiducia sono molto più forti della scienza....è successo molte volte che i medici abbiano dato per malato oppure con nessuna speranza di sopravvivere dei neonati e poi come per miracolo sono nati sani e forti....hanno detto che è molto strano che la tua creatura sia ancora viva eppure il suo cuoricino batte molto forte e si muove, quindi perchè non dovrebbe essere così forte da nascere???<br>  parlale, digli che la sua mamma la vuole vicina e che non deve lasciarti!!!<br>  quindi forza porta avanti la gravidanza....andrà tutto bene!!!!|`|79c120aab65106c91b1e607e292292cfaa	Non so cosa dirti perche' ci si bisogna trovare in certe situazioni per decidere una cosa pittosto dell'altra.<br>  Penso pero' che farti un paio di domande e risponderti, possa aiutarti un po' di piu' a capire cosa e' meglio fare.<br>  Ad esempio :<br>  - Se decidessi di abortire, riusciresti ad andare avanti senza che ti assilli il dubbio costante che magari poteva essere sana e vivere ? (una persona che conosco ha appena partorito una bimba sanissima a dispetto di un ginecologo che le aveva detto di abortire perche' avrebbe avuto un aborto spontaneo piu' avanti o problemi fisici e mentali se arrivava a termine gravidanza).<br>  - Se decidi di proseguire con la gravidanza, hai poi la forza di affrontare il fatto che piu' avanti o subito dopo la nascita possa morire (o nascere morta) ? Piu' si va avanti, piu' il legame madre-figlio si accentua.<br>  In bocca al lupo per qualsiasi tua decisione. Un abbraccio!|`|8pcTR6sBaa	Onestamente non so cosa farei. <br>  Se fossi in te ne parlerei senza dubbio con i medici e con mio marito, cercherei di capire quali sono i rischi per me e per la bambiana e come sarebbe la sua (e la nostra) vita se lei venisse al mondo, a quali difficolta' dovrebbe andare incontro e a come si sentirebbe se venisse discriminata (perche' purtroppo quando sei "diverso" ti discriminano).<br>  Valuterei il tutto, probabilmente senza troppa fretta (visto che nessuno ti corre dietro) e poi deciderei assieme a mio marito.<br>  Mi dispiace molto che ti trovi in questa situazione, davvero.<br>  Ti sono vicina|`|9kByv1CWaa	beh, mi zia ha avuto una bimba mentre aveva la rosolia, e dagli esami i medici le avevano detto k sarebbe nato un vegetale...lei ha continuato, ed al primo pianto della sua creaturina ha capito k la speranza di una mamma è fortissima....tieni duro, xk se la tua bimba è sopravvissuta fin ora, ki ti dice k nn  lo possa fare x crescere e maturare???|`|tX2OdFaFaa	io proverei a proseguire e vedere come andra a finire!!<br>  spero con tutto il cuore che fai la scelta migliore che ti dice il tuo cuore!!<br>  mi dispiace veramente tanto x il tuo bimbo,segui il tuo istinto e il cuore!!<br>  baci da stella ciao<br>  baci|`|CGXVGJjcaa	La speranza e' l'ultima a morire..anche contro la scienza..se ti senti di portarla a termine..va avanti!|`|Ctq4IdGVaa	qualunque sia la tua scelta credo sia giusto farla insieme a tuo marito........|`|H3Pg3gahaa	guarda mi dispiace un mondo dirti certe cose. io al posto tuo interromperei la gravidanza anche se con il cuore in mano prova a pensare questo anche se la darai alla luce viva ti sentirai male perché sarete in tre a soffrire nel guardarla per poco sapendo che se ne  andrà di li a poco lei non proverà amore e la gioia vostra ma solo le vostre colpe non farai a meno di chiederti di chi e la colpa non farai a meno di piangere e non saranno lacrime di gioa lei proverà sofferenza non potrà mai essere allattata da te non portai prenderla in braccio ne tu ne tuo marito. interterompi questa gravidanza con la speranza di dare alla luce un bimbo sano e bello come mai visto prima guarda che e possibile parlo per esperienza di mia sorella lei ha dato alla luce una bimba malformata per un errore del medico che non se ne era accorto. tra un mese la bimba e morta e un annoi dopo e nato un bambino meraviglioso che oggi ha quasi 5 anni ti giuro e tremendo vedere le altre mamme allattare i loro bebè sapendo che per te in quel momento e impossibile dammi retta e meglio cosi pensa a gli altri figli belli e sani che sicuramente avrai ti abbraccio forte forte auguri|`|IFoqODMiaa	mi dispiace non so che dire penso che solo tu puoi decidere x te e x il futuro della piccola la mia paura e se la porti fino al termine e cmq senti i suoi calcetti ,senti che si muove e poi dopo che e nata non c'e piu tu poi cosa penserai ?e difficile e spero che i medici hanno sbagliato che le prossime analisiescono bene.....auguroni e buona fortuna|`|KLSFYGWlaa	cara, hai tutta la mia comprensione e le mie preghiere.

WFMNeQFiaa	Il parto è, senza il minimo dubbio, un momento intimo, al limite, dove possibile, della coppia altrimenti è solo femminile. Poi, dopo, con calma diventa un evento "collettivo" ma ti immagini che traffico in sala parto oppure quelli con le telecamere... no diventa quasi ridicolo per non dire tragico (mi è accaduto un paio di volte di dover fare assistenza urgente, per strada, in attesa dell'ambulanza...). Mei de no! E poi una donna dopo un parto ha bisogno dei suoi tempi e non credo abbia voglia di avere intorno gente festante che non sa nulla o quasi di quello che ha passato... <br>  Quindi, prescindendo dal fatto che la scelta è totalmente personale, non esitare ad essere inflessibile. Il momento è il tuo e la scena pure. Sei regista, sceneggiatrice, produttice ed attrice allo stesso tempo...scherzando si potrebbe dire "tutto intorno a te.."<br>  Auguri.|`|AiHlyR8raa	Io mi prenderei tempo. Una visita veloci dei nonni, se no muoiono e al limite ti possono aiutare con i viveri. Dopo quando te la senti inviti chi vuoi. Ma prenditi tempo non scappa nessuno.

I piccoli erano protetti da germi e batteri dalla vetrata che impediva ai visitatori in contatto diretto, per prima cosa, io ero oltretutto libera dai bebè ed avevo quindi più tempo per chiaccherare e scartare i regali che mi hanno portato in ospedale.<br>  Quando sono arrivata a casa ho avuto il tempo di organizzare la vita mia e di mio marito con l'arrivo del neonato ed ho avuto tutta la libertà e l'intimità per potere girovagare per casa con vestagliona, pantofole e "tetta in mano" senza avere il via-vai di parenti e amici.<br>  La festa per tutti l'ho organizzata al mesiversario di entrambi i miei figli ed è stato un vero successo!!!<br>  Ti ho raccontato la mia esperienza, io ho preferito fare così.<br>  Se pensi di fare diversamente potresti già organizzare la festicciola a casa mandando già gli inviti in modo da dissuadere tutti a fari visita in ospedale........potrebbe essere una cosa simpatica e non offensiva.......e poi, senti, se ti vogliono bene capiranno.........|`|NI7hqXaFaa	Secondo me hai perfettamente ragione!<br>  Però comprendo anche i nonni che vogliono essere vicini in quel momento.|`|PomGOjvMaa	Penso che debba essere una via di mezzo.......intimo in un primo momento e festa all'arrivo dei parenti....|`|XCp7BE0Yaa	prendere spunto da un film per una cosa così importante è semplicemente ridicolo, come la maggior parte delle tue considerazioni. quando dovrai partorire l'ultimo dei tuoi pensieri sarà rivolto a chi c'è fuori dalla sala parto. io e mio marito eravamo nella privacy + assoluta, anche se fuori c'erano alre persone come mia mamma, i miei suoceri e i + stretti. dalla sala di attesa le persone non possono intervenire. quando invece tornerai a casa, sempre per esperienza personale, non credere che avrai tanta voglia ed energia per festeggiare, il bambino dovrà ambientarsi nella sua nuova casa, ai nuovi odori, ai nuovi luoghi e la festa non è il massimo per questa situazione, anzi, il viavai di gente sarà solo un fastidio per te, che vorrai goderti un po' di relax dopo tanta fatica... o forse no... tu devi sembrare per forza sopra le righe...<br>  <br>  <br>  LEGGENDO LA TUA NON DOMANDA SULLE SCULACCIATE... MI DISPIACE, MA ORA SI SPIEGANO TANTE COSE... SE SEI RIUSCITA A SMETTERE CON L'AUTOLESIONISMO SMETTILA ANCHE DI LESIONARE LE NOSTRE SCATOLE!!!!!!!!!<br>  E VAI CON LA SEGNALAZIONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|beb5e484aa88e3595eadd4dd83283f2daa	Intimissimo.........in fin dei conti per te si tratta di una "sorta" operazione.....solo parenti strettissiiiimi
Yj9g6LXzaa	The most important thing to do is read the weight and height limits on the booster seats.  It is safest to keep a child in a car seat as long as possible.  I dont have the links anymore but I have seen some crash tests comparing safety seats for kids and it is pretty scary.  My son is 2, 35 lbs and 40 in, and I JUST turned his forward facing...and only because I had to since he is so tall.  If he were smaller he would still be rear facing.<br>  <br>  DONT put a child in a seat if they do not meet the height and weight requirements...other then that use your best judgement.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay safe.|`|EvlZc0BPaa	i think it is age 4 and 40 pounds.<br>  check out this website, you type in your kids stats and it tells you what you need!<br>  <a href="http://www.boosterseat.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boosterseat.gov/</a>|`|PgzZNnLRaa	Your child should stay in a seat that uses the latch system in your car.  Britax makes a car seat that can hold a child up to 80 pounds.  By using only the seatbelt on a small child, you are putting your child in danger.  If you were to be in a serious accident and the seatbelt failed, your child could be seriously injured.  I didn't know this until I saw a video on youtube about a little boy who died in a booster seat.  Watch it and it will change your mind.  The parents have also set up a website for their son and they help people buy the car seats who can't afford them.  The website is kyledavidmiller.org.|`|ef88a8ae3afde5ec4c890c32c8b9c3faaa	You really should ask someone at the fire department - they know the ages and the laws (concerning car seats and booster seats).  Every state is a bit different - so you really need to know the exact laws and then go from there.|`|rRSZ0nKtaa	You need to check the weight limit requirements for the seats. It should be listed on the outside of the box. Remember to never ever buy a used car seat. You never know if that seat has ever been in an accident or how old it is.|`|uVHl0LExaa	Every state is different and most do not put a minimum age to move to a seat.  Some states go from 40lb to 80lb must be in a booster seats.  You can keep them in  a car seat as long as you want.<br>  <br>  The main thing is the extra restraint, car seat or booster.  If they fit you can move them.<br>  <br>  See link below.  covers most states.|`|2d9e0e9148447017052db088725c0ad4aa	idealy he need to be 40lbs but............I put my little girl in one and she is about the same WEIGHT.|`|6QX3Ne00aa	the straps have to be always at the same or above the height of the shoulders. By the weight I think he may need a booster seat|`|838f026ae518358047bacf68b85077a3aa	It depends on the laws in your state, but most car seats have the recommended sizes right on them.  If he is too big or uncomfortable in one that has the padded bar in front of him, then I would say go for the one that has a high back and shoulder harness, it still gets belted to the seat like the one with the bar.

641beae60688099041011b6babec9db6aa	Provo a capire, io che sono di una generazione precedente alla tua di analizzare e individuare quali siano le reali caratteristiche dell'attuale universo giovanile. <br>  Abbiamo una dilatazione dell'età adolescenziale e <br>  il conseguente protrarsi di atteggiamenti di dipendenza <br>  e di conformismo, proprio di quell'età. <br>  Malgrado le apparenze, la vita del giovane di oggi si caratterizza per l'assenza di un reale protagonismo, <br>  cui fa riscontro l'incapacità di scegliere e, conseguentemente, la difficoltà ad assumere la responsabilità dei propri comportamenti. <br>  D'altra parte, l'ideologia dominante incoraggia a credere <br>  che la forza degli eventi incomba sulla decisionalità individuale determinandola: è la cultura dell'alibi <br>  che caratterizza larga parte dei rapporti interpersonali <br>  tra il mondo giovanile e quello adulto. <br>  E' in questo contesto che si realizzano le dinamiche <br>  perverse della "concessione" e della "contrattazione" <br>  più che del "riconoscimento". <br>  L'identità personale ed il ruolo sociale ne escono <br>  mistificati, confusi, appiattiti. Il soddisfacimento dei <br>  bisogni soggiace a tali dinamiche, sicché da un lato assistiamo ad una proliferazione dei bisogni artificiali <br>  (quelli legati alla modalità dell' "avere" e dall'altro lato assistiamo alla mortificazione dei bisogni naturali <br>  (quelli legati alla modalità dell'"essere"). <br>  E' così che i ragazzi di oggi "hanno tutto", ma sentono <br>  di "di non essere nulla". Sul piano emotivo la conseguenza <br>  è una forma di apatia, quale risultato della confluenza <br>  di sentimenti contrastanti poco controllabili. <br>  Il grande sconfitto risulta essere l'amore, per un verso deprezzato a causa della tendenza giovanile a credere <br>  che tutto sia dovuto e dalla conseguente incapacità di leggere e comprendere i suoi segnali; dall'altro frainteso <br>  ed erroneamente identificato con atteggiamenti stereotipati ed insignificanti sul piano della rapportualità. <br>  In ordine al bisogno di amore, si determina una <br>  generalizzata insoddisfazione, che incrementa i problemi della comunicazione e accentua il sentimento della <br>  solitudine. <br>  Forti sono le ripercussioni sul piano sociale: <br>  la presenza fisica viene a sostituire l'atto comunicativo e partecipativo; lo "stare" sostituisce l'"esserci". <br>  Nel gruppo prevalgono atteggiamenti di competizione su quelli di collaborazione ed anche la "complicità" perde il valore di "collante sociale" per piegarsi a fini individualistici <br>  e particolari. Le spinte emancipatorie, sostenute da una "disobbedienza" che ha smarrito il suo valore critico e propositivo, finiscono per rifluire in comportamenti poco motivati perché ispirati ad un conformismo gregario. <br>  Sulla base delle considerazioni fin qui espresse è <br>  possilbile tratteggiare il quadro del "già", relativo <br>  all'universo giovanile. <br>  Ne emerge un soggetto "disorientato" rispetto al <br>  proprio passato e soprattutto rispetto al proprio futuro. <br>  Ciò spiega l'appiattimento dell'esperienza giovanile <br>  entro la dimensione del presente (presentismo) <br>  e la perdita dei tempi forti dell'attesa e del ricordo. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|de1c7531c38bc66984bfdd31991a8c25aa	Forse stai Crescendo??? è normale...l'unica cosa che devi fare e vivere tutte le emozioni al massimo...|`|03f6566cbd87e5e2245831c107e795bfaa	Lo sooo!!!!!<br>  Come ti capisco...=)<br>  Baci<br>  <br>  Rispondete a questa domanda per favore, grazie mille<br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am3Nm8B1JpE8PKKo2jxkKbPwDQx.?qid=20070503053621AAvz7le">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|7332a24de93cfb1147daf8432ca5b843aa	purtroppo sì... e ti dirò di più... questa è solo la prima fase... so come ti senti... io ci sono ancora dentro... vorresti urlare e scappare... ma dove vai?<br>  bisogna avere tanta pazienza e aspettare i 18/20 e poi si è ragazze/i|`|O8wXxMECaa	A me mi capita spesso di non essere capita, e allora si scatena una forza dentro me che mi dice di urlare con tutte le mie forze e penso a farlo dentro di me, ma alla fine non lo faccio e sto ancora più male...|`|rUZuWsaaaa	Tranquilla...secondo me sono i momenti più belli della vita...poi crescendo le emozioni diminuiranno di intensità...cmq goditi la tua adolescenza e nn pensare di essere una nullità...|`|01qpUcjmaa	é la stessa cosa che succede anche a me!! alcune volte vorrei mollare tutto e scappare in qualche luogo lontano senza lasciare alcuna traccia di me!!|`|PMbpLrQ2aa	si che mi capita..certe volte ho dei nervi pazzeschi!spaccherei tutto..mi capita quando litigo con il mi ragazzo o quando litigo con mia madre!mi mette un nervosismo mia madre insopportabile!......|`|QLQW0D4Eaa	stai tranquilla sono momenti che li abbiamo passati tutti.|`|b46c347272fe46b37f79c8902890308faa	Ma che adolescenza e adolescenza???????<br>  Perchè ogni problema legato ai giovani deve essere causato dall'adolescenza?

Il fatto che tu abbia stimolo ad andare in bagno frequentemente è già un sintomo, ma il bruciore è ancora più patognomonico! Il fatto che tu senta il bruciore come proveniente dalla vagina è solo una sensazione, mentre è più probabile che esso venga dall'uretra... anche perchè lo senti anche quando fai pipì. ciò non esclude che tu non sia incinta, ma la probabilità di una cistite con questi sintomi è molto alta... Prova a contattare un medico, anche se non gli dici dei rapporti a rischio, sicuramente ti consiglierà di fare un esame di urinocoltura, oppure puoi andare in farmacia e chiedere un antibiotico per cistite... (non ricordo il nome, ma si prende anche senza ricetta)<br>  se vuoi fare il test, aspetta almeno un paio di giorni dalla data in cui dovresti avere le mestruazioni... così è sicuro che sia attendibile.<br>  Ciao ciao!|`|akv5lClkaa	non è un sintomo di rilevante importanza questo...<br>  il bruciore puo essere dovuto da vari fattori, magari anche di una poca igiene prima e dopo il rapporto. i sintomi di gravidanza sorgono dopo circa 30 gg e sono ben diversi da quelli da te descritti, ma comunque se ti serve per sentirti piu sicura , fai pure il test.|`|cjzn4aBUaa	SunFlower83 ci ha dato nella risposta!!

La notion de respect de l'autre n'existe plus, les gens ont l'impression que leurs enfants leur appartiennent et qu'ils peuvent en disposer comme bon leur semble mais ils les détruisent au lieu de les aimer et de les aider à devenir bons.|`|3e2da01c0a50a62b040856b9ce3c1a49aa	c pas bo|`|414bc277ebe150a2ecafe781c26b2b79aa	je me suis dja occupé des femmes victimes de violences et les enfants se trouvent svt au milieu. ils sont tres perturbés et mm cassés . par la suite je me suis occupé de personnes lourdements handicapés et jy ai retrouvé des personnes ayant un passé de violence, dépression, schyzophrenie, deficience (du aux coups).bref cest tres ...moches, revoltant, chocant. ca fait bcp reflechir qd on a par la suite des enfants sur la consequences de nos actes et de notre education.|`|705fa50e3e4e52ef21602201971cde5faa	C'EST AFFREUX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Il faudrait absolument qu'il y ait des infirmières dans toutes les garderies et les écoles pour veiller à la protection de tous les enfants et aussi pour faire de la prévention, informer les parents, etc... <br>  Il faudrait aussi absolument améliorer la loi sur la protection de l'Enfance et bien informer le public (par les médias, télé, journaux, magazines, etc...) que toutes les formes de violence envers un enfant sont INADMISSIBLES et donc, INTERDITES!!!!!! <br>  Il faudrait aussi informer les parents sur les conséquences de la maltraitance qui sont extrêmement graves!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  BREF, LA VIOLENCE ENVERS DES ENFANTS NE DEVRAIT PLUS POUVOIR EXISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|930715b767f5c44c95d042af259c8b3eaa	Il n'est pas question que des enfants supportent une quelconque violence d'où qu'elle vienne , encore moins des parents.<br>  Dans ce 21ème siècle trop de stuctures qui protègent les enfants existent pour que des enfants maltraités se taisent sur leur souffrances.<br>  Aucun parent n'a le droit de faire souffrir son enfant quelque soit la raison.<br>  Les parents se doivent d'aimer d'aider leur enfants qui n'ont jamais demander à naitre.|`|c057b1f7ed6e31b0a426984a15fc1ea0aa	C'est lache et ignoble je ne comprendrai jamais que des parents puissent faire ?a à des enfants !|`|3463066b5438127fd47415534909767baa	exécuter par certains parent en vers leurs enfants : Oui , c'est fréquent .<br>  la plupart de ses enfants serons des malades .|`|e70614d349cdfc5b2b5738f4ab859bcdaa	je fréquente cela tous les jours dans mon travail (éduc spé). vaste débat pas si simpliste que tu le formules.<br>  <br>  mais les dégats psy sont évidents et profonds...
4rvcrppOaa	Look into the MySimpleCard.com<br>  membership. This will reduce your cost of maternity<br>  and later by 50% or more. Greetings, Katty|`|NKeUPohRaa	I received all my hospital bills before they submitted them to my insurance. <br>  My stay was :$2,500<br>  The charge to my midwife for delivery was: $1,300<br>  My son's stay after birth was $2, 300<br>  <br>  This was a delivery with no complications and no extra care for my son. I did not have an epidural but pain meds through an IV. An epidural would be very expensive because they would have to call the anesthesiologist|`|J9oQ8dCYaa	First, there is the OB bill which must be paid prior to birth (typically 7 months). That is, on average, about $2,800.  Then, if you cash prepay at the hospital, it may be as little as $6,000 (and this may cover a c-section as well).  Average vaginal birth is around $7,000 while C-section is $12-15,000.  <br>  <br>  My cousin and his GF had no health insurance and made too much money to qualify for aid. They took loans out on their cars to prepay the hospital bill (she ended up staying for 4 days due to complications, but they didn't charge her any more). They'll be paid off in another 2 years (baby is 2 years old yesterday!).<br>  <br>  Some women have a homebirth with a homebirth midwife.  Average is around $2,000 including prenatal care. Ultrasounds are extra.<br>  <br>  Do check with Social Services. Some states now provide maternity coverage for folks who don't have it.  You pay for the insurance, but it's on a sliding scale and is available no matter how much you make.|`|1e671b0731e329f9cce89d55a1be07beaa	I believe when we got the insurance statement it was between $5000 and $8000. get medicaid|`|26SqFq6Iaa	My sister in law had to owe the hospital $30,000 for delivering her baby there. Depending on the hospital. But you're looking to spend maybe up to $60,000 the most for the good hospitals|`|a9461b5f4d3947f3d7745faacbfa7083aa	Well, I'm not too educated on the hospital part of it all yet, but I can tell you what I've paid for the doctor's care.  At the office I visit you have to have the doctors paid for your care up through the delivery by your 8th month.  My insurance (Anthem) covered 90% and I was responsible for the remaining 10%.  What I have paid, and this is only for my OB, not including the hospital or the care for the baby while in the hospital, was right around $390.00.  So it's really hard to say what yours would be.  A lot of insurance providers are 80/20 which means you would be responisble for 20% of the bill.  If you don't have insurance medicaid is a great option.  Go to your local dept. of job and family serives.  They can help you through the process.  Even some OB clinics do the paperwork for you.  Good luck!|`|bc4782da989744a491a7587eecbb2a9faa	2,000 on up.<br>  If you do not have insurance and are at a lower income there is a spend down they will set you up with at many hospitals.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine made $9.00 a hour full time and she paid only $750. for her whole stay and prenatal care.<br>  Hope that gives you an idea|`|AA11722454	We have insurance but they sent a bill to us accidently .  It was for $5000.00, vaginal birth.  My other kid 4 years ago was for $7000.00, vaginal birth all with no drugs.  Epidurals run $1500.00 by themselves.|`|Or1N8cPhaa	C-sections are $3000. If you can't afford it, look into medicaid.|`|ca9e0905d6f5eb32fc2bca9414dbd0ddaa	my ob sent me a bill of how much it costs to have each procedure done.....a vaginal delivery is 3500 and a c section is almost 4000. And then you have to include the doctors fees and the hospital fees for each night you stay there and then if you have an epidural it's extra, an episiotomy is extra and if anything else goes wrong it will be even more. I would say to try for medicaid and if you can't get that, try <a href="http://www.maternitycard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.maternitycard.com</a> they lower your bills a considerable amount.|`|iLKPNj7Uaa	Where do you people get the money to pay for this??? Come to Canada and have your babies!!!|`|nYVNMedVaa	look into maternitycard.com.  they work with the hospitals to reduce your bills up to 60%.  you can already be pregnant and sign up.|`|odyW6e5Taa	My c-section delivery and hospital stay cost about $7500.  My daughter's bill was about $1500.<br>  <br>  Vaginal births are much less expensive.|`|uYLTkadYaa	A LOT.......I have always had insurance so I don't know all but I know that yesterday when I signed up for my epidural they said it would be $2000 if I didn't have medicaid! Now if the epidural is that much then imagine the other bills! Yikes....|`|xVGwhoyXaa	My hospital bill came out to be over 10,000 dollars with all the medication and everything. But I had the antibition for the group B strep, My water broke, an epidural, and the water through the IV. Whatever it's called. I stayed two nights and had to get percocet, sleeping pills, and the 800 mg Ibprofen. But it didn't include the nursery stay for the baby. And then just to come in and catch the baby and some of the appointments it was almost 2,000 dollars to the OBGYN. We payed more before that. If you're worried about not having insurance or not being able to pay it get medicaid. As long as you have a note saying you're pregnant they will accept you and they will pay everything. Just make sure that you have a doctor that accepts it. I made that mistake.

T8IqrwxKaa	I have three children (two boys and a girl) and potty trained all of them successfully and quickly.  Parents are LAZY ... bottom line... they don't want to fool with potty training and put it off and it only gets harder and harder.  It's a complete myth that the child has to "be ready."  The only one who has to be ready is the parent.  I've had a lot of people ask me how I did it so I wrote an article about it.  If you would like to read it, go here:<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/238054/potty_training_made_easy_follow_this.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|AA11624675	My dad told me that his mom boasted that she never had two kids in diapers, which meant that every one of her kids was potty trained by 18 months. Then again, us Davises are a tad psychotic.|`|AA12324972	My daughters trained before they were two, but I made myself and my son miserable by trying to force him to train before he was ready. I finally gave up and he trained himself by three, not even needing a nightime diaper. Just all of a sudden. I would advise any mother(I'm a grandma) to make the potty available, and introduce the kid to the concept, but don't force compliance over something that will take care of itself in good time.|`|2330cb2c7d25b9c4c81247f390820865aa	each child is different.<br>  <br>  My pediatrician said when they show interest to start training.<br>  <br>  My daughter (who has special needs) was potty trained at 2.5.  My son was potty trained at 1.5.<br>  <br>  Each child is different.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  I completely disagree with you concerning your addition when speaking to Addi.  The child will let you know when they are ready to be trained.  WHEN THEY SHOW INTEREST.<br>  <br>  It is so easy to be a PARENT and think that you know everything when you have NO children!|`|90e35d49138d1b29ebd6b6f6bdec6a56aa	You can't give a child an age to do something. All kids are different. Children will be potty trained when they are ready.|`|hAbIAE6Laa	Actually Abbi is exactly right. You said it yourself you are not  a parent yet therefore you can not judge.  My son is 29 months old. We are working on potty training he isn't fully ready yet. He still has accidents sometimes and that's fine. We are working at his pace. Which is the best way for a child to learn.|`|wmOgseCgaa	I started potty training my daughter 2 weeks before her 2nd birthday. By her b-day she was completely potty-trained, she only had one accident in her bed.<br>  My son was completely different. Once again I started 2 weeks before his 2nd birthday...it didn't take. It actually took about six months before he went on his own, without a diaper or pull-up. <br>  Parents need to be vigilent. It's not something you can do once or twice, it needs to be constant.....like training a dog LOL|`|9c158ede4f7e999ea420d28f1725678daa	I have three kids and they were all potty trained as soon as they turned 2.  We took a week off and went cold turkey on diapers.  We didn't go anywhere, just stayed home and practiced potty skills.  We didn't use candy or treats or punishments.  Just stay home.  <br>  <br>  I agree that kids aren't potty trained soon enough anymore.  I am a teacher and there are times that a kid in kindergarten comes in not completely potty trained.  What kind of future do we have.|`|AA11197832	Every parent is different but I am going to start at age 11-12 months.|`|KP9nYRqXaa	You can start potty train the baby at 7 months old, as long as the baby can sit on his own.<br>  <br>  Don't get frustrated if your baby won't get it right fast, it takes time, be patient. Ideally, your baby will learn this in a week or two. The best time to potty train your baby is upon waking up in the morning.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|fpVDhV6jaa	NEVER keep them in diaper till there 20|`|msGGgBMBaa	Yes, it is completely up to the child. If you try to force potty training on them it will only discourage them and take much much longer! My daughter is 18 months old right now, we've been working on potty training for about a week or so. She just started showing interest in it, so I took her cue.<br>  Some children have fears of the potty and you can't hold that against them.<br>  You'll understand a lot more once you have a child of your own.|`|orStuyjQaa	At Birth!!  Check out the website tribalbaby.org/ECindex.html for information about an alternative to diapers (known as "elimination communication," "diaper free baby" and various other names).  This is a method of "potty training" used in many places throughout the world (it's very common in China and India for example) that involves watching your infant for signals that they need to pee/poo and then holding them over a bowl or toilet and making a "cue" noise (there's a bit more to it, follow the links below for complete details/instructions/suggestions).<br>  <br>  I've been doing it with my daughter since I found out about it 2.5 months ago (she's almost 6 months old now) and we go through many nights with the same dry diaper on all night.  I "catch" about half of the pees on most days (on some great days we use the same dry diaper all day!), and the rest go in her "backup" cloth diaper.  I have only had one poopy diaper the entire time--the rest have gone in the toilet.<br>  <br>  It's definitely not a method for everyone since it means you have to really pay attention to your infants "I have to go" signals, but I figure you have to do that at some age, why not do it now?  You also HAVE to be relaxed about it (wouldn't want some weird Freudian hangup 'cause I was pushy or tense).  <br>  <br>  It's a heck of a lot less laundry than washing all those dipes (and cheaper than disposables).  My daughter seems to really love it too.  My favorite book has been "infant potty basics" by Laurie Boucke.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm sure I'll get lots of comments about how whacko I am, but the truth is, it works, my daughter is happier, and it's worth at least reading about to see if you can make it work for you.  Best of luck to you!|`|yPYdCJLJaa	Each child is different!  You can't put an age limit on anything!  Both my kids were 2 when they finally got potty trained.  But my daughter was just a few months shy of 3.  The more I pushed her to use the potty the worse she would do.  But when she FINALLY got it in HER mind, hey I wanna be a big girl, then she did it over night!  And she hasn't even hardly had any accidents, because she was ready!
AA10267442	I had a miscarriage.  It starts as mild cramping and becomes more intense as if it were contractions.  I didn't really bleed until it became so intense that I couldn't stand up.  I crawled to the bathroom and it was literally a gush of blood (sorry to be so graphic)  I had to be rushed to the ER and have a D & C (Dilation and Curattage) to stop the bleeding.  I was 8.5 weeks along.<br>  <br>  Sounds like an unusually painful . to me but may want to get checked out by your doc to be sure<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|2af1a1fbd50bc15234b79cfe720ab389aa	You need to go to your emergancy department now, even before you results come through.|`|342759ae65992ddcf5ee4f6d8aee4f07aa	go and see your doctor<br>  quickly|`|AA11563157	It is very painful.

YR5syDfOaa	okay, try the 3 hours " E.A.S.Y." routine.. <br>     E - Eat, <br>     A - activity ( playtime!!!) <br>     S - Sleep ( nap ) <br>     Y- you time while baby sleeps.<br>  say she wakes up at 7, she should stay awake for an hour an a half ( including the feeding, thats wakey time) and then sleep for an hour and a half and over and over again. She'll get 3 naps during the day. She'll have her bedtime routine starting at 6, bottle and sleep by 7. Thats the suggested routine for a 3 month old.. After sh'es 4 months, its 4 hour SAME routine, so it makes life a little easier and more predictable for you and your baby.<br>  <br>  But do whats best for you and your child. My son adopted this routine very happily and quickly.. But remember, it's a routine, not a schedule.. Dont look at the clock and think,, OH! it's feeding time, wakey wakey!! .. Follow your baby, just in that order. Good Luck<br>  <br>  you let your baby play after a feeding so he doesnt associate a bottle with sleep, only as a bedtime routine.. that way he doesnt expect it during the night when he wakes up unhungry.|`|3VqP7cv1aa	Its most important that he sticks to his nursing schedule.  He is at the age now though that you can introduce some solids if you haven't already, cereal mixed with breast milk is good.  Instead of trying to schedule his nap times according to a book, schedule them around his nursing.  If he nurses at 9, then put him for his nap at 10...My son, who is now 4, takes his nap about an hour after lunch...but, until he was really eating solid foods on a better schedule, actually eating breakfast lunch and dinner...his schedule was his schedule, there really wasn't much I could do to change it.  Once your  son starts solids he will nurse at further hours...like 4 hours between....but I would definitely say that his naps should be scheduled around his feeding schedule...put him down for his morning nap after he nurses and the same for his afternoon nap....this works best if he nurses at specific times.  But Yes, the most important thing is his nursing...you don't want him to be hungry halfway through his nap....or to fight sleep because he wants to nurse....I hope this helps (I really hope it makes sense...lol)  Good luck!|`|XIPj0Stpaa	You can't really train a baby to have a schedule.  He will make his own schedule and let you know what he wants.  Feed him when he's hungry and he will probably fall asleep while he is eating if he is tired.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Honestly you'll find it hard to train him to go down for a nap time unless you plan on letting him cry for quite a while.<br>  <br>  When my son was 3 months, we would have a quiet time instead of a nap time. After we fed in the morning (the second time around), we would move into his room and I would sing/read to him while he played in his swing. He would sleep for about 60 minutes. <br>  <br>  The afternoon nap was always easier. We would feed around 1:00, and then he would go down for another nap, this time for 90 minutes or so.<br>  <br>  If you listen to your child, you'll be able to tell when he's ready for a nap.<br>  <br>  As for your question--I would stick with paying attention as to what your child needs. We kept ours on a feeding schedule most importantly. Your baby is going to go through growth spurts--there will be days that he sleeps little and eats a LOT. Then there will be days when he sleeps a lot and eats little. <br>  <br>  Babies grow when they sleep.
cAJrVLoiaa	I don't know but you should ask ur doctor!|`|HERzDa1Qaa	I don't think so, but I'm not a dr. <br>  I would stay on the antibiotics anyways though. A chest infection can turn serious if it's left untreated. Don't worry there is always next month.
3cfbb8fa8a31590bb2dab47e04487d10aa	You can download an ovulation calendar at www.ovulation-calendar.com   You just put in the day of your last period, and that you have your cycle every 21 days and it will tell you the days that you are most fertile. Good luck.|`|5VLp8r5haa	I have a 22 day cycle and I conceived on the 9th of my cycle.  I also used this ovulation calendar - <a href="http://www.ovulation-calendar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ovulation-calendar.com/</a> which actually has a 45 day free trial period, and we got pregnant on our first try (apparently I'm very fertile!).  Hope this helps!|`|Eoa2nVY0aa	Any time, friend. I got pregnant two days after my period ended, even though the books will tell you that nothing can happen that first week. It all depends on your body. If you want to get pregnant, don't sweat it, just try all the time. If you don't want to get pregnant, use contraceptives ALL THE TIME.|`|GkB2o0Zoaa	Any time. A normal 28 day cycle says you tend to ovulate 14 days after the first day of your period so I would say the greatest chance for pregnancy would be around 10 days after your period starts.|`|aSP8PECBaa	the best time is 2 weeks after the first day of your LMP. Try calling your ob/gyn and ask the nurse...they'll be able to give you a more accureate answer...my ob told me a woman can get preggers 4 days out of the month. good luck!!!|`|pR6DiygSaa	you can get pregnant anytime, but you are more susceptible when you are ovulating. But unfortunately, every woman is different. Not all women ovulate regularly or on time according to the average cycle. Get a fertility thermometer and you can see if you are ovulating based on the temperature.|`|68835352539b4ee15103e4c100c437f7aa	Of course you can, women usually ovulate 14 days before the beginning of the next period so you probably ovulate at the end of your period.

CxRJwJsraa	yes, they seem to fit...except Logan. It seems like it should be a boys name in the list, but Ashlee is very girly. I do like Ashley for a boy, but I think it needs a more definite boys name with it (like Benjamin Ashley). Ashton also seems boyish to me in the set, but not as much as Logan.<br>  <br>  And, I'd change the spelling of Graison.

It's great that you have an involved parent and you should try to resolve your issues.|`|A3zAXntxaa	That would definitely hurt her feelings. You could say that it makes you nervous having her there, or just grin and bear it, you're probably gonna hurt her.|`|VYWaL2graa	Parents love watching their kids in sports, theatre, etc. I'd say just leave it be.

If your parents don't let you out of your sight then you need to ask them yourself. Parents take opportunities such as sports to take pride in their children and you shouldn't have to make them give it up.|`|GU3RauKOaa	Wow, I would have loved it if my mom wanted to attend all of my performances like that...<br>  <br>  She sounds like she's proud of you and trying to be supportive so if you really don't want her to come be nice about it, ok? Just be like "Nahh... its gonna be boring you don't need to come... I'm gonna hang out with my friends afterwards anyway..." Hopefully she'll get the message. Good luck.|`|0d1b5fcc305ead0ef5c939b96424f4b2aa	She's just proud to see you doing something and she probably thinks you want her there to cheer you on and be supportive. Just tell her that you feel nervous about screwing up when she's there like there's extra pressure to win and it would be helpful to your nervousness if she stayed home for a few matches.|`|Wr6k76pZaa	Well everyone e else is saying that you should just let her come.

jtnS02Vxaa	My brother was dating a 15 year old who sent him explicit pics (he's 17) I was so proud of him he was very mature he told her to have more respect for herself and how pretty she was....later on in the relationship he asked her if she wanted a serious relationship(not sex) and she said no so he broke up with her. Girls are more experimental at younger and younger ages. They see so much on tv telling them that "sexy" is the new cool. I'd call her parents and tell your son to tell her to stop sending messages.|`|zReKPmgJaa	How much older is this girl?  Do you have anyway of contacting her parents and letting them know about this behavior?  This is totally unacceptable and further affirms why teenagers do not need to have unlimited access to technology.  Does she not realize that this picture could be posted online and affect her reputation?  If that was my daughter, I would take away the phone with picture/web capability and she would receive in exchange a basic phone that only makes phone calls.  I unfortunately don't think it's safe to take away the phone entirely.  Especially for safety reasons.  Unfortunately you can not control other kids.  All you can do is discuss this with your son and let him know what type of behaviors he should be looking for when it comes to girls.  Good luck to you!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Take her phone for a good long while. And give her a good talking to about self respect.|`|ksXayEUoaa	I would hope the other parent that knew would tell me so it could be addressed. Then I'd explain to her what it means to have respect and make sure she knows that fornications is sinful and why. And, I'd make sure she knew how her pornographic picture also could cause others to stumble. Then I'd have her apologize to the person she exploited herself to. As for the phone I would replace it with an emergency only phone (the kind that only has 3 buttons).<br>  <br>  I went on my first date (to 9th grade homecoming) when I was 13. It was more courting I think since there were always other friends around.|`|KYdg8tpUaa	My daughter would no longer have a cell phone, it is ridiculous how all these kids are acting with the cell phones and especially with the "SEXTING"..im 25 and i never had a cell phone , not even in high school..so i think i will decide when my son is old enough if he should have a cell phone or not..but judging by the way things are going now ..i doubt he will have one unless the cell phones companies come up with a way for parents to better monitor whats going in and out of the cell phones..|`|lmk3mKJgaa	my daughter would no longer have a cell phone. and pardon my language but she would have a good a$$ beating coming too. that would make it look like she has no respect for herself or others but my daughter does have respect for herself. and if it were my son getting the text change the number and if she so it again then take the phone and make sure he is not alone with her.|`|ngkNaQJeaa	absolutely unacceptable!<br>  sad thing is that alot of these girls get raped or end up with an STD or possibly pregnant. dating at 13? no way, theyre still children at that age!<br>  I hope your son doesnt see this girl, he should know that it is more than likely that she will be sending pics of herself to other boys and flirting. most of the time these girls do not stay with one guy|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Um my kid wouldnt have a phone at 13 only for emergency.

More adventurous names like Arrianna, Anthony, Grant, or Maddeline(Maddy).|`|1WSFNX35aa	Names are really personal.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can wait after the baby is born and see what name suits him or her..<br>  <br>  Or you could have a look in your family tree.. maybe a traditional name with a modern twist?<br>  <br>  I like Grayson and Skye.<br>  <br>  I also like Ada for a girl and Dominique for a boy.|`|7TXNlZL9aa	Girl I know exactly what your going through I'm 12 weeks and I'm doing the same thing.

GU3RauKOaa	Definately imaginary play. My almost 18 month old has a wild imagination. She eats pretend food from pictures in books, drinks from empty teacups and pours invisible tea for me. She feeds her dolls, and even tries to breastfeed her father and I. <br>  <br>  Its just the cutest thing, you wonder what exactly is going on in their head because they are so into it.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	My little boys are a year or two older than her but they play like that too.  They pretend to get stars that are hiding in the living room and give them to me to keep in my pocket.  They also pretend that they are eating and cooking and that they are going to work, grocery shopping and taking care of kids.|`|aBWu7tyHaa	sounds normal to me.  my kids did stuff similar to that around that age i'd say.  maybe the air in the jar tastes better than the air outside the jar.....LOL  sounds like fun, join her.  best diet you'll ever have.  all the cookies you want!|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Just good ol' fashioned play!  My 15 month old's been doing this for awhile as well as cooking with my spices and pouring her babies milk or feeding them.  I think it is the best thing to watch and I love it!|`|lqlfIEjNaa	Haha I thought my daughter was weird when she started doing that. She would also talk to her toys, and pretend to be them. <br>  She's just using her imagination!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	thats great!  my kids do the same thing.  my son follows mine and my daughters lead on pretend play.  its too cute when they do that.  have you got her a tea set yet or play food?  you are ready for 5 star meals now.  i often get served something yummy on a plate by my daughter.|`|AA10325228	yes it is imaginary play. How cute! Have you thought of buying her a little play kitchen to play with.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	They are all oddballs...lol!  Just kidding!  She is just role playing which is great!  Get her a tea set, or a kitchen set my kids both loved them, and it encourages imaginary play.  A toy kitchen is a great investment, she will play with it for a long time, you can get toy food, pots and pans.<br>  It is so cute when they really start to do new things and really start to play.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	It is just play my son will look through books and what not and see food pictures in there and he will say'' hmmm mommy so good food and act like he is eating it" at first I just looked at him like what the heck lol when he did it again I died laughing. I think its cute and its good I heard that means they are smart. Plus it teaches them how to play by theirselfs.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My eldest is 3 now and she loves imaginary play. She made some sort of bizarre concoction in her play kitchen last week - with eggs, salt, pepper, horses, chickens, ketchup, bananas, ham, strawberries, pasta, toast... and when she asked what else she could add, I suggested Cheerios...<br>  She looked at me in and said, 'mummy, that's disgusting'.<br>  Well.... obviously!|`|prqrQcd1aa	She just has an active imagination. My 17 month old does this as well, I think her 3 year old sister taught her to do it!
xVEqBjDVaa	I do the same thing!! I also seperate them until they can calm down and be nice again, then they have to hug. My husband used to make my oldest stand in the corner and hug for 5 minutes. lol!|`|fs6yiPRoaa	Spank them and send them to their rooms. Tell them if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. That way you accomplish two things 1) you get them to stop bickering 2) you get them to get out of the habit that women seem to develop of talking|`|ExQGD2uwaa	I say, "HEY!" and smack 'em on the butt.  I like your way better, though.|`|0tVZNb2Caa	my grandma tryed to start this new idea like anytime me or my sister call each other a name we had to pay her 5 cents it made us behave for awhile|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I separate them. Sometimes I will make them apologize or say something nice. But only if they said something mean.  I will more than likely lecture them telling them the usual "you only have one sister" or "you should take care of your brother" blah blah blah.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	i beat there *** haha;)|`|AA10345820	I let them fight their own battles as long as no one is getting hurt seriously. It toughens them up to face the real world. People in the real world are a lot meaner than family is. They have to be able to express their opinions. I do have them hug and apologize when all is said and done.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	when i was growing up if we said something mean, (when we got an allowance) we would have to put a quarter in a huge jar that was in our parents room with no way to get it back.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	I'm just grateful that my children are 8 years apart.  I don't have this problem.  There's an up side to everything, I suppose.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	a tap on the hiney
Abyibth3aa	i know how you fell!! i have a 7 yr old and 3 1/2 who is very attached to me. i cant go ANYWHERE with out my youngest!! i feel like were attatched at the hip and though i love my kids more than anythig i would love some alone time!!! not having to clean the same messes everyday,running errends faster...it would be alot easier if i had some me time once in a while!! so do feel bad your not alone!! :)|`|fQxSClHKaa	i'm not a mom, but i'm sure my mom feels the same way.<br>  like this morning - i was getting hairspray from the cupboard above the toilet, and i knock an empty perfume bottle into the toilet.<br>  not to say i'm not capable of handling it myself,<br>  my mom just took charge. and she wasn't very happy with me after.<br>  i guess it's just part of being a parent. but i'm sure the good times you have with your children much outweigh the bad ones :)|`|zRQmWC5saa	seems to me u get stressed out over the least lil things. <br>  enjoy them, there wont be tampons and turds floating in ur tiolet for long!<br>  and to say " sometimes u hate being a mom" just tells me ur all about urself. u had them, now deal with them and try to tell ur daughter by talking to her to not put her tampons in the tiolet again plsy allways flush before u leave! I have kids and a girl too not one time did i see this in my tiolet. She was taught better.|`|iFXe1Obvaa	I'm telling you anyhow: make her do it. If she makes a mess, make her clean EVERYTHING in the room.<br>  <br>  My mother made me do that once when I left ONE spot of blood on the seat. I had to put bleach in the tub, clean the floors, EVERYTHING!<br>  <br>  I'm a very tidy person.|`|JIhpmOlRaa	awe... I'm sooo sorry hun.  I really hope you get just one day to relax and take some much needed time for yourself.|`|uJwTzOoXaa	Of course mothers and fathers feel this way. That's why you've got to correct the behavior so you don't have to deal with it over and over and over again. So, firstly, talk to her about the proper way to dispose of a tampon and then get her to clean it up. So what if she makes a mess, if it happens more then once get her to clean that mess up too. If you step in disgusting water or maybe even crap your not about to die. you'll be happier knowing you raised a respectable young woman who is clean and takes responsibility for herself rather than a little twit that got that way because you were afraid to get dirty once or twice (I wonder whats dirtier really, having to clean the mess up or stepping in some toilet water.) <br>  <br>  I know it's not what you wanted to hear but make her do it. Dealing with that **** sucks, yes, but you seem like a woman with enough character to be able to deal with it.|`|MFKgVsoAaa	well i honestly can't relate to you because i'm more on the "12-year-old daughter with the used tampon" end of the spectrum (except i'm not 12, i'm 14), but i was actually just wondering that last night. my 7-year-old sister just woke herself up in the middle of the night coughing and crying, and she threw up all over her bed and was still half asleep so she almost fell back asleep in her own nasty mess (you were graphic too! now it's my turn), and i was amazed at how calmly my parents handled it. my mom just rushed in and helped her take a shower and comforted her while my dad changed the sheets and cleaned everything up, and they were both so calm and collected! so i was wondering how can parents stand it? i mean, i babysit a lot, and i do have to deal with some situations, but to do it ALL the time? so i guess you just have to do it, because when you're older your kids will be the ones taking care of you and of their own children. it's just this really annoying, repetitive cycle. but anyways, just hang in there! your kids probably really appreciate it (:|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Get a covered garbage can for the bathroom (the type with a cover on it).  Tell her that she is to wrap the tampon in tp and put it in the can.  Tell her that if she can't do this you will put her back on pads - the big thick uncomfortable kind.|`|llUVXlLKaa	Just get her to be in the pad she is to small for tampons don't you think is part of having a girl you have to have patience tell her to clean her own mess otherwise you are going to be a slave for a long time from cleaning her mess make her be responsible of her own cleaning good luck mother of twins girls patience|`|GUuFKaaiaa	tell her that if she blocks up the toilet to tell u b4 u find out or she will be punished<br>  my mom gets fed up a lot too but its nothing like that<br>  its just that me and my bros are messy and she needs help but that we are all busy and when we have free time we don't wanna clean|`|w6tQEuKCaa	AWW i feel so srry for you..eww..JUST TELL HER TO STOP PUTTING THEM IN THE TOILET|`|AA12020110	i doubt any 14/15 year old kids  think about this when they are talking themselves into "doing it".   <br>  <br>  Yeah, a parents job description is ..clean up the messes.   With a sick child ,  with a baby necessary, you just do it.   Though frequenently the learning curve is pretty hard.  A 15 year old had a new baby with bad bad rash, and skin infection,  doctor asked what she was cleaning the infant with after a BM...girl said, "oh I thought she did that herself, I clean myself." ...child was a mess.  So was Mom.  <br>  <br>  After my mom died I realized all the times she had just stepped in and did.  And did not complain.  It is called love.  and our job is to show that to our kids, so someday they will show it to theirs.   it is learned, not instinctual.
kHLwlNA5aa	Morgan is a great name for a boy or a girl.|`|TCpPdqcBaa	No, I think it's very feminine.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Yea that kid will get his *** kicked, morgan is a girls name, not a boys name, that will make him go through hell not only in school but for the rest of his life. I feel so bad for your child if you name him that =(<br>  if he is smart when he is 18 he will legaly change his name, and have you ever been in school with a male child named morgan? Adults are different then kids, kids are crule and dont care about the feelings of others|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I like it for both!  It is actually on my list for both genders.  I have <br>  Morgan Wyatt & Morgan Danielle.<br>  <br>  Edit I wanted to add that other than Morgan Freeman there is also Morgan Earp, he was wyatt earps brother.  My husband love Old west stuff and that is why he chose Morgan Wyatt.|`|NePgB9b2aa	I love Morgan for a boy! It's so handsome. :)|`|mFC2RBL3aa	I like that name, but not for a boy.|`|bFP6jfvVaa	I prefer it for a boy name, but I know a girl named Morgan. I finally saw signs, last summer, I believe. And I really liked that name for a boy even more so after seeing that.<br>  <br>  It's not too girly, but it's not too manly. Its an in between name. Like Beau, Alex, Sam, etc.|`|W0nd3qF3aa	I love the name Morgan for boy  and a little bit for a girl! I have a puppy who is a boy and I named him Morgan. I think its so cute and I dont think people would make fun of him|`|i3LYGGEpaa	As a male Chelsea, I can tell you that Morgan is not that feminine. There are enough male Morgan's that he won't feel he has a girls name. It is fine. A genuine unisex name.|`|LeQiljr7aa	I like it, though i warn you, it sounds like the name of some,genious dark synical but attractive guy.|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	Its unique, i've also met a couple of male morgan's.<br>  But i wouldn't name my son morgan.|`|GgGpkYYgaa	hey my names morgan and im a girl <br>  by the way! and if it was for a boy they would get made fun of <br>  since the girl way is sooooo popular|`|wDsw9thcaa	I like it it sounds nice for a boy, but I am going to have to say it sounds better for a chick|`|g7sZ8elHaa	not really. but my friend is in love with morgan freeman... does that help?
aa01690707f25106fb64b7b4af022300aa	of course|`|bcZSIphUaa	OF course you can.<br>  <br>  IT would be highly recommended to get it cleared up before TTC though - (a) because it isn't healthy for the baby and (b) you can pass it to your man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11

gEBBpvlFaa	Open adoptions are not legally enforceable. People who want your baby will promise you just about anything and then renege on it once they have your baby in their hands. It happens all the time and if you spend some time on this board, you will read about open adoptions that were suddenly closed for no reason at all...except that the adoptive parents were insecure and selfish and decided to close it. End of story. Once the mother of the baby's rights have been terminated, there is nothing she can legally do to force the adoptive parents to allow her to have contact with her child.<br>  <br>  Here is my advice: since you sound as if you are unsure as to what to do, wait until your baby is born to make a decision. You say that your parents are supportive. That's fantastic! Should you decide to parent your baby, they can help you raise your child while you finish high school. If you still want to relinquish your baby once he or she has been born, there will be plenty of people lined up to adopt him or her...even after a few months have passed. Try parenting your baby first. Don't 'choose' an adoptive family while you are still pregnant. Your hormones are different now than they were before you got pregnant and you don't know how you'll feel once your baby is born. When that little person looks at you for the first time, you may decide then and there that you want to parent. If that's the case, I would hate for you to feel obligated to surrender him or her to an adoptive family just because you made a decision before the baby was even born. <br>  <br>  Focus right now on being healthy so that your baby has a good start. Any decision you need to make can be made after the birth. Keep this in mind: you don't OWE your baby to anyone. Your baby is YOURS and the father's; no one else's. No one has a right to your baby besides you and the father. Anyone who tries to pressure you into relinquishing your baby for adoption is being coercive and you don't need that when you're hormonal and trying to make the right decision. I know that you are concerned that you won't be able to give your baby everything he or she deserves. That's admirable. But like Possum said, your baby wants YOU. If you relinquish your child, you will miss him or her every day of your life. Your child will always wonder why you couldn't or wouldn't keep him (or her). Don't trust that an adoption agency or that adoptive parents will tell your baby the truth about you -- that you were young and worried that you couldn't give your baby the best of everything. Adoptees are lied to all the time because so many adoptive parents are insecure and worried that their adopted children won't love them if they know the truth about their natural parents. So they lie and say that the children weren't wanted...or that their mothers were on drugs or irresponsible...<br>  What a terrible way for a child to grow up, thinking that his own mother didn't want him!<br>  <br>  Just wait until your baby is born before you decide anything. Please remember also that the baby's father has rights too. If you decide to relinquish your baby, ask the father if he wants to parent. You BOTH have to give permission for the baby to be adopted and if the father wants the baby, then he should be allowed to parent his own child.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	It is good that you got a supportive Dad and StepMom.  You can discuss this issue among you and your parents.  Then get  legal advice from you family lawyer.<br>  Take care and GOD BLESS THE CHILD.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Please do NOT email any of the people here. They ONLY want your baby. They could give 2 squats about you.  <br>   <br>  Know that open adoption is NOT enforceable in the US. It is a ploy agencies and lawyers use to get young vulnerable women to sign their child away. <br>   <br>  You cannot give your child up for adoption UNTIL it is born, so do NOT sign anything with anyone. Please have your baby and get to know him or her a little more BEFORE you make this decision. Your baby already knows and loves YOU and does NOT want to be raised by strangers. Your baby DESERVES to be with his or her MOTHER...not strangers. THAT'S what's best for the baby. Many young mothers are fantastic mothers. Please do not do this to yourself or your baby.<br>   <br>  PLEASE listen to the first Moms and the adoptees here.

I think open adoptions are common in california, but not legally enforceable as far as I know. So you have to probe a bit to see if the aparents really want it, or are just saying they do. We adopted my daughter in CA 3 yrs ago. Actually I wanted an open adoption, but her first mother doesn't want ongoing contact, so we aren't in touch. Although we have eachother's contact info if needed. <br>  <br>  In terms of decision, you can change your mind up until you've signed the relinquishment papers - which happens after birth. Technically I think you can change your mind until those papers are registered with the state (a day or two) but you definitely want to be sure before you sign. Everyone involved in the adoption should realize it is your decision to make, and shouldn't pressure you. <br>  <br>  We worked with an agency called adoptionconnection.org, and also spoke to one called Independent Adoption Center (adoptionhelp.org). Both are very supportive of open adoptions, from my experience. You want to feel comfortable with whomever you decide to work with. Ask how many open adoptions they do vs closed, what kinds of contact the families have etc. You may want regular visits vs just photos and emails etc. If possible maybe they can put you in touch with other first parents they have worked with in open adoptions. I hope it all works out for you, what ever you decide to do.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Wait till you have your baby before you make a decision before deciding on the best option and research carefully.  You're young now but you wont always be young and find out who is willing to support you to keep your baby.  If you still decide adoption is the best option then do what you feel best but remember adoption is a permanent solution for a temporary situation.  If your baby is adopted and you later regret it there is nothing you can do to change that.|`|GOt88pwIaa	really think about it before they match you with a couple I am in the same shoes as you and I want to keep my baby but I keep getting called selfish and it hurts. I am in a tricky spot right now and I think you should wait a while before trying to find a couple to adopt your baby. and no the adoptive parents legally do not have to grant you an open adoption.|`|CZg79Qy9aa	Please don't do this to yourself.  Do you have a supportive mom and dad or any adults in your life?  They can help you.  Don't give your baby up.  I can not  begin to describe the pain you will feel over the loss of your child for your whole life.  I can't describe the hole in your heart that will be there for the rest of your life.  Hunny, I had a baby at 17 and tried my best but decided my son deserved better and had my older sister adopt him....there is no pain I feel that is more intense.  I applaude you wanting to do what is best for your child...even at your age....you are decent enough to think of your baby.  Please ask a family member to help, not adopt your baby, but help you finish school and go to college if that is what you want to do.  DOn't put yourself through this.|`|P1zkU3ldaa	I had a child at 18 in California.  I looked through the agencys and found nobody that I liked.  I finally found a family through a private sector.  How it worked then was this..<br>  Agency- you give them a call you told them about yourself and the pregnancy.  You tell them what you want to look for or not look for from parents, ie. race, sexual orintation, religion... <br>  then they sent you profiles to look through.  If you found one that you liked, you got to meet them and talk about all that you want to discuss.  they had the chance to say yes and no as much as you do.  If you do it through a friend or whatever, (privatle)  you stillhave paperwork.<br>  <br>  I meet mine parents and loved them.  they came to every appt, and were there in the room during delivery.  We did the paperwork and they went on thier way.<br>  Mind you it wasn't so curt as I am writting it.<br>  <br>  In CA you as the biological parents have 3 years (back then) to change your mind.<br>  <br>  As far as the adoptive parents I don't think they can "return" a child.<br>  <br>  Hope that works for you. This was 11 years ago|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	First of all, I applaud you for thinking of the child over yourself. I do agree with adoption, although not open. Its hard enough for adoptive parents to wait and wait and wait, then to have the birthmother involved, I would personally feel like I wasnt the childs mother if I was the adoptive mother. Let them have their child and live in peace with their own lives. Also, I would think it would be harder on you. To see the baby you gave birth to, but be raised and call someone else mommy and daddy. If you give your child to someone, it should be in full. You can let the center or whoever you are dealing with, know that they can let the parents know your name, and whereabouts, but that you dont want to be involved. But that is up to you. The child should have one set of parents, not a third wheel, I mean no offense at all......I think also, if you are going to do adoption, you should make that choice and stick with it. Please dont pick parents and then take it back. That is the hardest thing for adoptive parents to go thru, trust me I know, I cannot have children and have had it happen. They are so anxious, buy baby clothes, set up a room, and then no baby. If I do ever get the child Ive been waiting for, I would make sure they know they are adopted, but I would not want the bith mother in our lives. Ive seen so many shows on open adoption, and it makes it so much harder on the birthmother, the adoptive mother/father, and also the child. Most of the time, the birthmother ( when so young) ends up stopping her visits, and contact, as she goes on with her life. But sometimes when she keeps on it, the child is confused, being told that his adoptvie mother is his mom, and this woman who stops once a month is his birthmom. He hears mom twice. But its all your choice, and if you want to do the open adoption, that is great. If you choose not to, that is great also. I think at your age its the best option, not only for you, but your baby also. As you said, you are a kid youself. Its not fair to raise a baby when you are still partially one yourself. Just make sure you think it all out, and come to the best decision for you. Very much luck to you!!!!|`|SRmNJCdiaa	It really depends on what state your in and what laws you have on adoption.<br>  <br>  My experience here in California was that Through an open or partially open adoption I pretty much got to name my own terms on visitation or no visitation, having photos sent to me, how I wanted to be handled at the hospital.  And I had 30 days after the birth to change my mind and cancel the whole thing.<br>  <br>  I was 18 when I was pregnant, but still unready, so I contacted an adoption lawyer in my area.  Adoption lawyers are there to protect the adoptive parents, not the birth mother, so make sure you feel comfortable with the process.  I then went through over 100 profiles of families looking to adopt and basically had my pick of what I wanted most.  The family I found was perfect, they flew to meet me and were at the hospital shortly after their son was born, it was an unexpected c-section delivery.<br>  <br>  You have time to think about how you want to continue with the adoption.  Do you want visitation, do you just want pictures and updates, or nothing at all.  Having partial contact could be very emotionally difficult for you.  <br>  <br>  Please feel free to email me.  I did it.  I know its tough.  But it was the best decision I ever made.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I understand exactly how you feel, I've been there, except I was 17 and it was 37 years ago. <br>  I had a lot of years of guilt for making the decision to give my daughter up. Going home from the hospital empty handed was hard, her first birthday was horrible. <br>  It might seem like a good thing now, but in 2 or 10 years you will regret it. <br>  Open adoptions are not enforceable, once the child belongs to them, they can change their mind.|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	Make sure you know your rights - make sure you read this - <br>  <a href="http://www.cubirthparents.org/booklet.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cubirthparents.org/booklet.pd...</a><br>  <br>  You should not make ANY decisions before the baby is born - then hopefully no one will put added pressure on you.<br>  <br>  Open adoptions are not enforceable - and sadly - far too many are closed once the adoptive parents have that baby.<br>  <br>  This baby wants YOU - not a family of strangers.<br>  Find support - and parent if you can.<br>  There have been many many young parents before you.<br>  <br>  I wish you and your baby well.<br>  <br>  ETA: Adoption is a long term/life term solution to a short term problem.<br>  Meaning - you won't be young forever.<br>  No child wants to be given away - and there is never any guarantee of a 'better' life.<br>  I've wanted my mother every day of my 39 yrs.<br>  Be very very sure of what you're getting into.

m6YWglFmaa	Hi Karii<br>  <br>  It is a very disturbing thing when a baby is hurt whether it be by accident on purpose or through nature and of course threw no fault of it's own it always makes me mad and sad because this and other things should never happen to babies of any age.<br>  Now just because they are loving parents and it doesn't mean any thing being that they are only 15 yrs old, but just because they seem like they are loving parents it doesn't mean they couldn't or didn't do this.  I have seen first hand what can happen when someone is stressed out especially with a baby they can and do get mad and some times the hit the baby trying to make it stop crying.  many babies have been killed by their moms and dads because they couldn't get the baby to stop crying, they get all stressed out and go to far.  It is not easy to raise a baby for and adult so you can imagine and I am sure you know how it feels to be so young and have to raise a baby, life changes from having no responsibilities being able to go and hanging out with your friends to having to stay at home and watch your baby when everyone else is at the mall or beach.  Did they hurt their baby only they and almighty God knows the answer to that question, but their baby was hurt and is in pain right now and that is the truth right now.  Where are the parents of these kids? they should be living at home with one or the others parents just because they have their own kid doesn't mean they are old enough to be out on their own, their parents should be helping them with their baby, their parents better watch out the CPS doesn't take way the babies parents as well.<br>  Any way I hope the baby is doing okay and that your family can come together and help these kids out with their baby before they end up killing it for some freedom to hangout with their friends, if you thing that is crazy and would never happen then you need to follow the news more often how many parents have killed thier kids in recent history for one reason or another.  Tell the parents if they don't want their baby then give it the someone or put it up for adoption, there are lots of people out there that can't have babies that would take their baby in a heart beat.<br>  Don't know if this is the kind of answer you were looking for, but I hope it did give you some thing to think about.<br>  Good luck to you and yours and God Bless....Keep the Faith....Peace....cya....|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Osteogenesis Imperfecta (brittle bone disease) is a rare genetic disease.It basically is a defect in the production of collagen. There are four types ranging in different severity.<br>  <br>  Nobody her can say if they did or didn't do it.The doctors should rule out OI first and then take appropriate actions towards the parents.|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	Sounds like the baby is better off in the foster home.|`|cIn8BkYHaa	They should be able to prove if the baby has the disease by doing some tests, I'm assuming it was maybe the way the bones were broken that made the hospital assume it was in fact not an accident. However none of us can point any fingers. But I know if my baby was taken away I would not even be able to function let along buy myself presents at the mall. It's probably best for right now the baby not be in their custody, however they would definately get their baby back if they test and the child does have that disease. The disease is Osteogenesis Imperfecta. You can google it and get loads of info.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	15 yr olds shouldnt be raising a baby on their own ..obviously they didnt even have parents of their own to take THEM in a time of crisis.

SxPhldhhaa	I don't have children myself yet, but I recall having my first birthday party where friends were invited when I was 5. We held it at a local playground, which was actually a pretty good idea since we didn't have to spend too much cost-wise and we kept ourselves entertained at the playground for the most part.<br>  <br>  I think that, given the situation, keeping it family would probably be best for you. More people does indeed mean more cost, since you have more people to entertain, more to feed, and simply a bigger number to work with. Your daughter will have just as much fun celebrating her special day with her family.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I always stayed with my child<br>  Most people understood that<br>  She is special needs. <br>  In kindergarten, she was invited to a party, the women has a niece her age there with special needs, and send me away.  That was because her and hers sisters(2) were staying and knew how to deal with a special needs child<br>  <br>  Some parents are uncomfortable leaving there preschool age children at someone house they really do not know<br>  If they say, they will help, and will not except you to feed them<br>  <br>  That's a  good age to have one|`|1hciyvKdaa	In this situation Id keep it family. If your child doesnt go to someones home and them come to yours, they are not really invitable to your home as such. Kindergarten was the first time that I invited non family and friends over. I did know all the parents already since our kids would swap houses for play days and babysitting. I did not blanket invite and entire class!!!! Your child knows no different, so its not up for discussion, you throw a party and they enjoy it.|`|bBSAFsrhaa	i think you should make a party for her at pre-school buy a cake and ask the caregivers to share it with her classmates and you and ur husband can also be there im sure the careres wont have a problem with it. thats what my parents did for me had the same problem of inviting the parents over, and you can also do a party with your family at home. =) hope this helps and good luck|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I had my son's first kid's party at 7.

I went thinking that nothing was there for me, and stayed away from any snacks, etc., unless all the kids had eaten and the host family offered me something.  If you want to invite friends, just have ice cream and cake and it shouldn't cost much extra to feed a few parents.  Also, only invite her closest friends.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My son just had his birthday on saturday. He turned three.

Have another one. The chances of your next baby being stillborn are very slim, next to none, so don't let that put you off. It was probably just a random event. <br>  <br>  If you're really set on having a daughter, visit a fertility clinic, they should be able to help you out. They will take a few embryos and then implant any female ones they get, hence ensuring you have a girl!<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you may think you'll be really disappointed, but even if it is a boy, you'll fall in love with him, just as you have your other two sons. You seem to like kids, you have time and money to spend on them, so why not?! The disappointment will come to pass, and you'll appreciate the uniqueness of each son and love them all loads!<br>  <br>  You may think you'll be disappointed, but, if someone offered you a daughter (genetically yours) right now, in exchange for one of your sons, would you do it? I doubt it very much... <br>  <br>  Go for it, you won't be disappointed, a child is life's best investment... best of luck!|`|Ezkn5azdaa	First of all sorry about your loss. This is one hard choice to make to have another one or not. I am in your same shoes. I have two wonderful boys. I wanted one more and hoping it would be a girl. I always wanted a girl. I am pregnant again with my third and my last one has well. And I am hoping this would be a girl. But I know I still have a chance having a boy. But I know I would love this baby no matter want. I did lose a cousin and her unborn child that I never got to meet. Think about it for awhile and see if the time is right. The lord give you a child that you will love.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	I totally get wanting a girl. I also get not wanting to go through the loss of another child. <br>  <br>  Have you considered adopting? There are lots of children, boys and girls that are in desperate need of a loving home. <br>  <br>  If you do decide to try for a girl? Do you really think you would be disapointed in another boy? Like would you love them any less. If you're answer is yes (which I'm sure deep down is not) then I would wait a little longer before you make this decision. If your answer is no, then you had better get started!<br>  <br>  Anyway, best of luck, and I'm terribly sorry for your loss.|`|DHvsRiZQaa	If you want more kids go for it. You can try for a girl but remember it still might be a boy. But if you can't take another boy try adoption. That's a for sure thing. Do a privet adoption, way cheaper:) Good luck :) Not to offend any one but God has a plan and it will work itself out in the end:)|`|W4azwSU2aa	try again for another <br>  <br>  afterall, everything happens for a reason so if it's meant to be a girl it will be a girl <br>  <br>  there is always fostering and adoption <br>  <br>  good luck hope everything works out for the best <br>  : ) x x|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	Hun please do not take this the wrong way i have just read your question and noticed your name under your avatar ...is it what you really want !|`|KuaYk0Moaa	i understand you being aprehensive, the hospital will monitor you very closely due to your stillborn. if you feel ready then do it

bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	(((HUGS)))<br>  <br>  Thank you so much for not taking your child to daycare when she's sick. I'm the same way, but so many other parents send their kids to daycare and school when they are sick and just end up making a bunch of the other kids sick. I know how you feel though. This sounds like what I went through in late October up until winter break in mid December with my older two boys. Not long after I brought the baby home we went through nasty colds, ear infections, stomach flu, Strep (the scarlet fever type) and head colds again. The baby only got the sniffles twice throughout this nightmare. Having to deal with 2 sick kids on top of a newborn was the most exhausting experience of my life. They shared the colds & tummy bug with me too. Those two weeks of winter break were a much needed mini vacation! They were both well the whole time! My boys don't eat what they really need, so I give them gummy vitamins and they still get sick. I've given up trying to figure out why. Your little lady is old enough to eat yogurt, so be sure you give her some pro-biotic yogurt after all those antibiotics. BTW, an "upper respiratory infection" is a fancy medical term for a head cold so she doesn't actually need antibiotics as they won't do any good against a virus. Make certain that your daughter is only getting antibiotics for bacterial infections as they are useless against viruses and overuse can cause antibiotic immunity with the bacterias.|`|AA10943329	my kids are always the same. they just get over one thing and pick up another. They eat healthy but for 10 years they pick up every little bug Especially URTI. If the infection is bacterial then she will need antibiotics to get rid of it. When that has happened to my kids they usually change the antibiotic. I know you don't want to always be giving kids medicine but sometimes there is no choice. I keep telling myself it will get better, sadly it hasn't...yet|`|HztriBPAaa	You may want to ask your doctor to run a blood test to see if her immune system is working properly. I don't want to worry you but if she is sick a lot there may be a problem. My Aunt's kids were always sick and then they moved to a new house and they stopped getting sick. Turns out there was a serious mold problem in their old house so you may want to get yours checked for mold. Anyways I think you are a great momma for not wanting to give your sick child to other people especially if she might be contagious. I am sorry you are down just keep being a great momma and when baby girl is better have a girls night out with your friends to take some of the stress off.|`|lGcpXteaaa	Aww poor little lady! I hope she gets better!<br>  <br>  I think all babies go through the stage of being ill constantly. Mine certainly did and it has to be the most exhausting period of my life so far!<br>  I feel for you, i know how awful it is. Mia had bronchilitus at 6 months. Had to be in hospital for two weeks. The after a week of being home she caught gastroenteritis! She was back in hospital for another 4 days. Then she got an ear infection and teethed.<br>  It was the worst month of my life!<br>  I just kept thinking 'what am i doing wrong!' i felt so guilty for not being able to keep her well.<br>  <br>  I am the same, i couldn't be parted from my daughter when she was sick so your not over-reacting, men just don't think the same way as we do! Mine certainly didn't and he never supported me throughout the whole time...ugh<br>  <br>  I really hope she gets better and i send you sanity!! x x x|`|L3CXT6Muaa	hi, i have a 6 month old, she hasn't really been sick yet, but i could imagine how you feel, i absence over the littlest things, i think its great you are staying home with your daughter while she is sick, no matter how long she is sick i think you should be with her, you cant replace family with money.  i know if i was sick i would want my mom taking care of me. but i hope she gets better really soon, and i hope your partner understands how you feel about being with you child, good luck|`|TQW5E6olaa	This could totally be my question. Bella was sick almost every other week Mid Dec through Feb and in March she's already had a minor attack and viral thing going on. I don't take her back until her meds have had a chance to work.<br>  <br>  But man, I am so over her being sick. Constantly giving her meds, worrying for weeks at a time.<br>  <br>  She will get better, you could try another type of antibiotics, you're doing the right thing keeping her home and out of daycare.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Even if you feed her healthy foods, her immune system is still getting used to earth and all the germs it has to offer.<br>  <br>  Also, the antibiotics could have suppressed her immune system as well so it is important to get some probiotics into her system.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, just keep feeding her healthy foods (and vitamins) and her immune system will benefit.<br>  <br>  I, too, think it is disrespectful to leave a ill kid in day care.Not only because it is risking the health of others but seriously, who wants to be somewhere else when they can be home with Mommy when feeling ill?
tbeO3Lataa	Sometimes people turn to drugs with good intentions. That probably doesn't sound like it makes sense, but what I mean by that is that they turn to them looking for a release, not just a high. If this is the case, what your brother needs is a lot of support, and a lot of love.<br>  <br>  However, many also turn to it just because of teenage reasons (peer pressure, etc.) in which case, he may need a little tough love.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard to tell someone (been there, done that) because you don't want to ruin the relationship with the person. The fact of the matter is, though, that he might dislike you for a while, but when he is off drugs, he will thank you.<br>  <br>  Why don't you tell someone, but have them keep you anonymous? So, when they confront your brother, they can just say they "have reason to believe" he is doing drugs or something like that.|`|7p9qgkSFaa	How long will your parents be gone?

Lightweight, roomy, really contemproary parent friendly design. One hand colapse on it. Shocks, for a smoth ride. Haven't had any problems with it thus far. I got it at K-Mart on sale for 125, reg price 140. <br>  <br>  It's perfect for my 15 months old, and my 3 month old. <br>  <br>  But I've never had another one to compare, and have only had mine for a lil over 2 weeks...used it around 10 times I'd say.
hzgFAJv0aa	I will be the first one to say that as sad as it is, CPS is a necessary agency. Most of the time, they do their jobs well and I commend the people who work there. These people put their hearts into their jobs and sometimes even put their lives on the line for the kids who need them. <br>  <br>  I will say unequivocally that ABSOLUTELY, children need to be protected when their families fail them BUT:<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, CPS can and has, taken people's kids for all kinds of reasons even without abuse or neglect in the sense most people think of. Children have been taken because of religious beliefs (such as the recent FLDS case, several cases involving practicing Wiccans and some others involving fundamentalist Christian religions) educational choices (home schooling or alternative education), political beliefs (communists had their children taken, racial supremacists, etc.) and other lifestyle choices (such as communal living, nudists, etc.) among other reasons. Many times these cases result in the children being returned but there are also cases that resulted in permanent separations of families, some rightfully so and some not so rightfully.<br>  <br>  Most people think that they have nothing to worry about because they don't abuse or neglect their children - but you never know what constitutes abuse or neglect to someone else.The CPS system has been abused by people because of its anonymous reporting and the devastation that it can bring to a family. It has been used to "get back" at people who have done nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  One of the other problems is that there ARE NO LEGALLY DEFINED RULES about what constitutes abuse and neglect and if it is played in the right light, ANYTHING can appear to be negative. <br>  <br>  Run a Google search on CPS fraud or CPS abuse and see what you get. Mixed in with the people who are pissed about being caught being bad parents are REAL VICTIMS who have paid the ultimate price for being "different" than the "normal".<br>  <br>  CPS is generally a good thing and mostly removes children when they are in DANGER, but abuses DO happen (false accusations, over zealous SWs, etc.) and so do mistakes (filing mistakes, mistaken identity, poor evidence collection, missing files and sometimes even kids themselves! OMG!!, etc.). <br>  <br>  It IS possible that an unscrupulous person from CPS/DSS could attempt to take these children for the purpose of adopting them out but the chances are not that likely. (Most people who work for these agencies are good people, unfortunately they are not the ones who get all the press time...)<br>  <br>  My only real concern would be this:<br>  <br>  "kids are white, healthy and ages 4 and under"<br>  <br>  it makes them PRIME TARGETS for helping fill adoption goals, "targets" or "quotas" because they fall into the "highly adoptable" category and whether or not people believe it, there ARE federal incentives for States to adopt out from foster care.*<br>  <br>  I would be careful if I were this family. <br>  <br>  (Or ANY family! I am very careful with mine!! You wouldn't believe how well I have learned to keep records!) <br>  <br>  Just to be safe. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/cps_vict.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/cps_vi...</a><br>  <a href="http://californiahomeschool.net/howTo/cps.htm" rel="nofollow">http://californiahomeschool.net/howTo/cp...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wesclark.com/ubn/insight.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wesclark.com/ubn/insight.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.texascps.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.texascps.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thsc.org/ParentalRightsandCPS.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.thsc.org/ParentalRightsandCPS...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.alliancealert.org/2008/04/24/texas-flds-case-religious-belief-and-homeschooling-or-abuse-on-trial/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alliancealert.org/2008/04/24/...</a><br>  <a href="http://ehealthforum.com/health/cps-harmful-or-helpful-t139674.html" rel="nofollow">http://ehealthforum.com/health/cps-harmf...</a><br>  <br>  ETA: Randy said, "These processes involve courts, lawyers and judicial oversight all throughout so the idea that they would swoop in, grab kids and place them for adoption "just because" they wanted to is absurd." and yet it HAS happened.

Im doubt if a parent's eating disorder is grounds for termination of parental rights, though...unless there is evidence the child is suffering from this. <br>   <br>  As far as depression goes, many adults suffer from depression. As long as it is controlled with therapy and or medication and there is no danger to a child, it is NOT grounds for termination. Millions of Americans suffer from clinical depression.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	I don't believe they would make any moves to take away your children. They would have to prove that you are a really unfit parent. You need help with both depression and your eating disorder. You seeking help is proof that you are a responsible adult, trying to get the help you need, for your sake and for the sake of your children. You are going to have to trust someone to get help. There are many moms out there who have the same type of problems honey. You need to stop worrying and don't let this stop you from getting help.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	no, as long as the child/ren is fed properly and cared for properly. also if the mother is seeking help then it shows that she is aware of her situation and is seeking help. CPS would not take the kids.|`|355b8dca4624a65380892a4d414c9d3faa	If a parent is seeking treatment and managing their illness and the children are not abused or neglected there should be no problem.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	Yes, I think you might have a problem. And I agree with what Flying Monkey and Mama Kate and what others have said about CPS. They have given you excellent advice and information. In recent decades, the system has increased its power to take children for more reasons, and in shorter time frames.<br>  <br>  The system is supposed to help children in trouble from abuse, but there are people who are working in the system who are corrupt or ignorant, or just plain emotionally disturbed themselves.<br>  <br>  States gets bonus money for adoptions out of foster care, due to the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, and there have been more additions to that legislation in recent years.<br>  <br>  I don't want to see you hurt, but you need to be aware. Married parents are not necessarily safe. I work with family preservationists in the legislature in my state and many married parents have lost children to CPS...and then adoption, eventually.<br>  <br>  Most people who adopt are white, and they are looking to adopt very young white children, and that is why..children under 4..and white, if available are a social worker's dream as someone else already said.|`|BTuFtui3aa	It's really, really important that you get help. Leaving these conditions untreated is what will harm your kids, not trying to heal yourself.<br>  <br>  According to their professional ethics, anything told to a counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist, therapist, etc. is considered confidential and privileged information unless there is imminent threat of harm or danger to the patient or others. <br>  <br>  So unless there was actually some evidence of potential abuse/neglect, I'm not sure how CPS would even find out about the psychological conditions? If the therapist informed CPS without very solid grounds, that would be extreme malpractice. Most therapists aren't prepared to commit professional suicide like that, so I wouldn't expect many to be willing to ruin their careers to try to stick it to a parent who did nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  Assuming CPS did somehow become involved, placing a child in foster care and placing a child for adoption through the state are wildly different things. The parents of a child in foster care will be given a case plan and time to follow it before termination of parental rights is considered (unless it's a case of criminal abuse.) If the state eventually decides to TPR in a case of noncompliance with those case goals, there is an appeals process. So even if a child was apprehended and placed in foster care, the parent(s) would have the opportunity to get their child back. Adoption would happen only after a lengthy TPR legal process.<br>  <br>  So basically, for a child to be immediately removed and adopted out in this situation would require a tremendous number of people to violate their professional ethics in a coordinated way-- highly unlikely to the point of being all but impossible.<br>  <br>  If you're suffering from depression and an eating disorder... regardless of if it's Nervosa or not... you really need to get help. I've suffered from both of those things, and I can tell you it WILL wreck your life, and your family's life, if you don't deal with it. <br>  <br>  The danger to your family comes from NOT getting the help you need. What you tell your therapist is confidential, unless you're threatening harm to yourself and others. Therapists usually err on the side of confidentiality even in borderline cases. Getting the help you need will NOT cause you to lose your kids. You can safely seek counseling without worrying about CPS involvement as long as you are not a direct danger to your children, so please don't delay therapy because of those fears.|`|j0xfBk5Caa	YES!<br>  <br>  Anorexia is considered a life threatening mental disorder, it also comes with physical and emotional side effects that can leave a person unable to care for their children. If CPS becomes involved it would be on a case by case basis as to what action, if any, they would take. The only way they can remove the children is if both parents are suffering or if the non ED parent is away from the home for very long periods of time and the ED parent has no alternate support in place. <br>  <br>  Some of the things that may cause them to apprehend the kids could include, food hoarding if it involves keeping rotten food, lack of food in the home, physical or emotional symptoms that leave the parent(s) unable to care for the child properly (this is all in the eyes of the SW), if your children are picking up your disordered eating habits it can be considered mental abuse,  if any depression that can accompany EDs if it is severe. There are probably more but this is what immediately comes to mind.<br>  <br>  ETA<br>  <br>  Sorry to burst bubbles but race and age play a very large role here. As Mama Kate has already stated white and under 4 = an adoption agents dream come true. Ask my son, if you can find him.|`|oB1TH9Auaa	I wouldn't think so - unless the person suffering from depression and anorexia will be in residential treatment and the spouse cannot handle being a single parent during that time.<br>  <br>  Most likely, they will monitor the situation and work with the parents to ensure that nothing goes wrong.<br>  <br>  As I live in MN - your CPS may act differently.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	First of all, race - age - and parents marital status don't play a part in this question.  I kind of find it offensive that you'd mention race as a factor...and I'm white!<br>  <br>  Second, as long as the child is being cared for, fed, clothed, emotionally/mentally stable, etc.  I don't see why they would take him/her away.|`|jtnS02Vxaa	If cps is involved their first plan of action would be to keep the children in the home, and help the parent get help. As long as your children are not neglected, abused, and have all their basic needs met they should be fine. They may do a course of action plan to help you get the help you need. It sounds like you truly love your children, you just need some help for yourself. Good luck with everything hun.|`|Alyvp37Maa	Good grief, of course race and the age of the child plays a huge role.  It would be wunnerful if it wasn't but the sad reality is race matters. sry this is in reply to someone who takes "offense" blah blah blah.<br>  <br>  I would listen to Flying Monkey, Mama Kate, and Monkey Kitty as usual they give insightful information.  Best wishes to you.|`|k1uUjz9aaa	children's services are child stealers and they can do whatever they feel like they make up stories to steal kids and the adopters help them do it|`|nxHztcslaa	no as long as your kids are looked after and not in danger then they wont do a thing... this is why people are scared to get help when they need it... dont worry and continue your counselling..|`|OQnRP6xVaa	No, and Yes, there would need to be more then just these issues.  There are many Adoptive Parents who have depression and anorexia. And many who have had these issues as well as many others before they adopt. <br>  <br>  CPS or the case workers with the foster care and adoption system place children in homes with parents who are ordinary people with their own issues or problems during life. What they look at is How the Parent managed to get help and cope.<br>  <br>  I have seen a situation (my best friend) where a child was placed into foster care because his mother had a debilitating illness and was expressing suicidal thoughts. The state did look for other relatives to place her son with and also gave her a case plan to work toward getting him reunified. <br>  <br>  She was assisted in finding the services she needed, and help with her medical condition. She was asked to establish a support system with family and friends and receive counseling. She was provided with Section 8 housing, home health care, and other benefits to help her better manage her own life and care for her son. <br>  <br>  Once all everything was in place to insure her son was safe and that his mother was not a danger to herself or others he was returned to her. The situation she went through was actually very helpful and gave her the support and services she needed to spend the rest of her live as his mother. She died only a few years later due to complication of her medical issue... <br>  <br>  The fact that she had gone through this made it possible for his needs to be addressed for after her death and they were. Her son was welcomed by some friends who offered her son a very secure and stable life. He graduated from High School last spring.<br>  <br>  As long as you are actively doing something about these issues it means you care enough to care about yourself and how this may affect your children. Abuse and Neglect are two very important things to consider but, in some states "Risk of Harm to Self or Others" may be handled in a different way. <br>  <br>  In some states what you are worried about happening wouldn't be because of Abuse or Neglect to the child--It can be about the Risk of Harm any person may be to themselves or others which can lead to hospitalization or treatment. If a person is involuntarily held for Psych Evals they would be asked about such things as minor children so the children could be cared for. <br>  <br>  They would most often contact the other parent, grandparents, aunts, uncles or any other family to see if they can care for the children. At this point if there is family who can care for the children and they run down and get them the children wouldn't necessarily even go to a foster home. If a parent is held in a hospital or in jail and the other parent and no grandparents, aunt or uncles run down to get the kids right when it happens then the state has few choices but to make sure the children are in the care of able adults.<br>  <br>  As long as your children are being fed and there is adequate food in the home Your Diet will not result in the loss of your children. It is NOT a negative thing to get counseling or treatment for a Human Problem and is ONLY a Negative if a person tries to pretend they don't have a problem. Eating disorders can be very damaging to children.<br>  <br>  Depression is common--and believe it or not you can even adopt foster children if you have a history of depression, the fact that you recognize it and get treatment is what makes the difference. Locking yourself behind the doors and pulling the curtains is what gets you into trouble. <br>  *|`|72SrLDQ3aa	CPS only takes children away if they are in any kind of harm. So unless you are depressed and often become angry and violent, I highly doubt they will take kids away.|`|AA10494763	yes and no.<br>  if either interferes with their parenting or if they need to go into residential treatment and there is no family to look after the kids then CPS will step in. <br>  Neither alone will make them take a child but if you are a danger to your self or others deemed by a therapist or pscy they have  duty to warn in their ethics.  legally they have to say something but if you are not threaten to kill your self or others and the children are taken care of no|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I think it is very possible and in some cases it is probably quite needed. There are all types of abuse that aren't just physical but emotional and both depression and anorexia can come in very extreme forms. <br>  <br>  In many of the cases where a mother kills her children depression was a contributing factor and after the fact many question why no one, including the state, stepped in to help and protect the kids from possible harm stemming from the depression. Andrea Yates would be an example of this as she was suffering from postpartum depression. Children under 5 years old are also more likely to be victims of parental murder so in this case you present that could have had some impact if the depression was severe. <br>  <br>  Many people suffer from some type of depression but in extreme cases I think it would be wise for the state to step in regardless of if the parent is getting help. In the process of getting help the kids could still be at risk. <br>  <br>  If married the father may not be in a position to care for the kids full time due to work schedule or anything else despite being married. <br>  <br>  It is possible for there to be no neglect/abuse but a very real risk of danger. While I don't think every parent who suffers from depression/anorexia should have their children taken from them I can admit that there are cases where it could definitely be a needed action for the children's safety.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I believe they have to prove that there is harm possible to the children in the form of neglect or abuse.  They may come in and take the children regardless but in most areas (I hesitate to say ALL but I believe that to be true) they must convince a court of the need for continued removal and if they were not able to do so then the children would be removed.  <br>  <br>  There is a whole process that must be undertaken before the children could be placed for adoption.  The seizure order used to get the children must be changed to a temp guardianship order which must then be changed to a permanent guardianship order before they could even consider placing them for adoption.  These processes involve courts, lawyers and judicial oversight all throughout so the idea that they would swoop in, grab kids and place them for adoption "just because" they wanted to is absurd.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Actually I know someone who this happened to. After her divorce she become anorexic and suffered from depression. CPS took her children and their father now has full custody.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	There's a big difference between anorexia and anorexia nervosa.  The two terms are not synonymous.  <br>  <br>  Anorexia means a loss of appetite.  This can come from a host of sources, physiological or psychological.  Chemotherapy causes anorexia, that's why people take Marinol or other medications that stimulate the appetite.  Anorexia is a side effect of many, many medications.  Depression can also cause anorexia... just don't feel like eating.  So can stress... ever been too worried about something to eat?  Or been so busy that you forgot to eat?<br>  <br>  Anorexia Nervosa, however, is a serious psychological disorder which involves self-starvation, or like bulemia, binging and purging.  The self-starvation can get to the point where it constitutes a real danger to the lifelong health and life of the person.  <br>  <br>  So, depression coupled with a loss of appetite, I seriously doubt could be grounds for someone to be mentally incapable of caring for children unless it was extremely severe depression.  Even so, in the case you're talking about, there is another (presumably) functional adult in the home.  So, extremely doubtful, unless that person was a danger to themselves or others.<br>  <br>  Severe Anorexia Nervosa, however, especially with no other functional adult in the home, could be a different matter entirely.  This is much more severe and pervasive than basic depression.  In the most severe cases, people with anorexia nervosa can't take care of themselves.  The disease is so pervasive that they must be continually observed because they are such a danger to themselves.  Or they are in such a weakened state from muscle and fat loss that they are physically unable to care for themselves or others.  In those cases, especially if there is not a functional adult family member able to step in, I could see CPS ruling that the children are in danger.

huKvvNpvaa	We started scooting around 6 months crawling on all fours by 8 months. She is now 9 months and cruising. <br>  <br>  "Something you should definitely keep in mind when your compulsion to compare gets the best of you (and it will): Babies today are developing later in some major gross motor skill categories than they used to. Not because they're less naturally precocious, but because they're spending less time on their tummies. Putting babies to sleep on their backs dramatically reduces the risk of SIDS, but it also temporarily slows motor development. With little opportunity to practice those skills babies used to practice on their tummies (such as rolling over and crawling), more babies are accomplishing these skills later. Many are even skipping the crawling stage entirely. Though this slowdown isn't considered significant developmentally (and skipping the crawling phase is never a problem unless a baby is skipping other developmental milestones as well, such as rolling over, sitting up and so on) parents can help their babies along by making sure they spend plenty of supervised playtime on their bellies from an early age. (Parents who wait too long to flip their babies at playtime will find that their babies balk at this unaccustomed position.) so remember: back to sleep, tummy to play." - taken from What to Expect the First Year|`|S6QpB8QZaa	My son was 6 months when he started crawling. Some babies decide they don't want to crawl at all. My niece never did crawl, she would just scoot sitting on her bottom. I figure she just got frustrated with trying to crawl. Both her and my son are constantly running around now so it didn't hurt her any.|`|AA11346395	my son is 11 months and he is just doing the army crawl and he just started it at 9 months|`|w4zjmhxoaa	Some babies skip crawling all together.  My son didn't crawl until he was 10 months old.  And even then, he didn't "crawl" in the traditional sense.  He scooted around on his bottom, with one leg bent inward, swinging the other leg around and using his arms to move about the house.  He could really move with his "monkey scamper"!  I think crawling frustrated him, because he couldn't move as fast -- so he pitched the idea =)  Now he's 22 months, and his favorite thing to do is run.|`|WPI0Z47saa	He started crawling/scooting backwards at 5 1/2 months and forward on all fours at 7 months. Some babies are 9 months before they crawl. There is such a large span on when it can start. I would think if they get close to 10 months and haven't even made an attempt you should ask the doctor but some totally skip crawling and go right to walking. It is hard to compare babies.

2bkV73gpaa	OMG!<br>  <br>  I'm sorry about your parents. I'm sure it's not easy to deal with at 20, but imagine trying to deal with it at 13.<br>  <br>  But forget the spanking. I'm not in favor of spanking kids. OK, I was spanked growing up but I really don't think it's really a big deal one way or the other, as long as it's not abusive and it's applied fairly. I'm not hung up on the age thing either. I was spanked at that age. Not regularly. But I don't think whether she was slightly younger or slightly older would be a big deal.<br>  <br>  On her brothers' behalf, I have to say it's unfair that they are spanked for misbehaving and she's not. How are they spanked? By the bare-hand? Pants down? In front of their siblings?<br>  <br>  If you really believe spanking her would help, then she should be spanked too and in thesame manner the boys are spanked, even if them watching causes her same and embarrassment. But she should not be spanked with an object of any sort (neither should the boys; use your hand and spank them nowhere else but on their bottom).<br>  <br>  If you don't spank her, then the boys shouldn't be spanked either. Neither by you or by her. She shouldn't be spanking them anyway. You should be in charge of disciplinary issues, not her. She obviously isn't capable of it.<br>  <br>  That said, I hate to be judgmental, but you seem to be leaning in that direction. Please reconsider.<br>  <br>  I had a friend who was spanked harshly by her stepmom (who hated her) on her bare bottom in front of two younger stepbrothers on more than one occasion at about that age. She eventually ran away from home and if not for another girlfriend and my girlfriend's parents who found Melanie wandering the streets in a big city, who knows the bad things that could have happened.<br>  <br>  Consider the issues you and your sister are going through, you might only make matters worse by spanking her, no matter how embarrassing or hurtful the spanking you plan for her.<br>  <br>  Why is she allowed to hit her younger brothers? Who allows her to do that, you? For what purpose?<br>  <br>  Try some major family counseling. If you're a police officer, consider yourself fortunate because you most likely have a decent health insurance plan that will cover a huge part or all of the costs associated with counseling. Not all families going through such crises are that fortunate.<br>  <br>  One last piece of advice. And this may sound harsh but this is serious!<br>  <br>  If I knew you personally and knew that you, as a police officer, ''faked'' an arrest of her, I would hope that you would not only lose your job but spend some time in jail yourself for arrange a false arrest (and the same for your buddies who would thing of participating in such an act).<br>  <br>  That is so unprofessional, if your supervisor knew you were even considering such a thing I would hope he or she would discipline you (and I don't mean with a spanking).<br>  <br>  There are enough bad cops out there that need to be canned. Don't end up one yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7srXwLZcaa	OMG!!!!! Are you for real. Call a family member who is an adult to come sort out the situation.<br>  Children looking after children.<br>  Shame on you for wanting to use violence on your sister.|`|qCFwSyFAaa	don't do that i live with my brother who is ten and my 25 year old brother he spanks us try any things to make us stop i am 11 and i have add|`|bJh1MesQaa	Yes. Please tell us what you did.|`|OeyqGRa1aa	dimetre stfu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hate u!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  love the so called sister you love.....|`|DnNkCF6Taa	You know man, I have a feeling that you have an idea by now, with the question you have asked before on how to handle the situation.  I think by now what you need to do, is to take the advice of old and try to go with your gut and your instincts based on similar questions you have asked on how to handle things, with spanking or not... and fake arrest is just not a good idea.|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	sounds like if you have any adults in your family aunts uncles etc call them to deal with her. if not you should tell her that she can straitn up or she will have to do chores and be grounded for more than a month and tell her that if she wants to act like a baby she will be treated like one. she will have to be walked to and from the school building she will will have to come straight home and do her homework and she will not watch tv and she will go to bed at 9 pm nightly. also if she refuses and continues to throw stuff tell her u will call the law and they'll will take her to juvinilee and if you have to fake the phone call and see if it makes a difference. it is uncalled for her to kick someone pregnant in the stomach. you may want to talk to her teachers or counselor at school as well. if she is spitting and etc if nothing works, i say becareful bc if you spank her she may try to get back at you or call the law and get you for abuse. so if you have to call the police have someone come talk to her and put her in her place. ihave heard it being done before to help calm down teens. good luck|`|VBlrL1puaa	It sounds like there are deeper psychological and internal issues. You should contact her school and tell them you would like her to meet with the school psychiatrist, which they have on campus, and talk to her. Do not hit her for hitting someone else. Thats being hypocritical and she learns nothing, she will then wonder why its ok for you to hit her when she does something wrong, but not when she hits her little brothers when she does something wrong. I would tell her she is not permitted to leave the house, see her friends, speak with her friends and everything else you did was great. Time out doesnt work for 13 year olds. Tell her to sit in her room and she can leave when you say so. If needed, force her to stay in there.|`|CP9HIoDqaa	I don't think spanking her will do any good in this situation. She seems to be really depressed. She needs counseling. Whether she wants to go or not, she needs to. You need to make her go, but she seems to be hurting emotionally & instead of expressing her pain, she hides it behind anger. See a counselor.|`|SeuAdzclaa	No, I'd say it calls for a trip to court, a visit with probation officers, and perhaps the judge could suggest other measures.  If you allow her to abuse her younger siblings, you are an accomplice to the abuse that occurs if you know about it and allow it to continue.|`|ReCh1tCtaa	OK it has been an hour since you posted a question about<br>  your sister having heart problems and being under weight.<br>  WHY HAVEN"T YOU CALLED 911? <br>  not spank her she does not no what to feel she is starving <br>  and does not no how to Handel her emotions. she is short<br>  tempered just like you because her mind is out of balance.<br>  PLEASE HELP YOUR LITTLE SISTER.<br>  she needs you now more than anything and all you want to <br>  do is HIT her! why would you do this to this supper thin little<br>  girl? I BET SHE IS HAVING A PANIC ATTACK FROM ANOREXIA!|`|jupKSOzwaa	That's just crazy.. I feel your frustration you must be having. I think you should so something because of what she did to your girl friend.. the fake arrest would cause her to be worried, in my case it would.. I'm 13 and I would never do something like that. Would the fake arrest just make her hate you more? She would be a little disappointed you had tricked her.. maybe? But it would teach her a lesson, and you could explain something could happen if she kept acting like this. I really hope you find something to do! And best wishes for the future happenings? :)|`|xSrVaaChaa	I am sorry to hear about your parents death. Your sister may have anger issues from that so maybe some grief counseling would help? You need to do something to get hold of this child before she seriously hurts someone. I would give her a spanking not with my hand though...hands are for loving.. probably a spoon.. Sounds like you have a out of control 13 year old... its probably just a phase, but one that you need to end soon!|`|qRElKKjXaa	Wait. I'm confused. In an earlier question you said that your parents were on a business trip, and now they've passed away? <br>  <br>  You've asked like 20 questions about spanking this 13 year old girl. IF your parents really did just recently die, then get her into some grief counseling classes, pronto. If you are making all this up, then shame on you.

That is just wrong. It's one thing when a child misbehaves but it really REALLY gets to me when people hurt pregnant women. If that where my daughter she'd get a spanking like 30! She'd get everything taken away except for her bed and the clothes on her back.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Maybe have someone like officers come and section her temporary the the hospital maybe a 3 day until she gets cheeked out.|`|lc51V6EAaa	instead of that you need to threatnen her that you will call the police and have them take her away|`|mFC2RBL3aa	I think you should have someone like a doctor go to your house to see her.

YIPIIXHlaa	Girls: <br>  <br>  Siayla (sye-a-la) - This is very pretty :-) I've never heard any of these names, and this one kind of jumped out at me the most. It's very pretty.<br>  Akira (a-cure-a) - This ones nice as well, but the other two girl names win for me.<br>  Harlow - This one is very pretty as well. I think it carries a certain mysteriousness, to me. I'm an avid reader, and it makes me picture a strong woman. And not manly, like someone else said. Strong as in independant. <br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  Jerseron (Jess-er-on) -This name IS neat. And you're right, who cares if that woman named her baby this. This is your name choice and your life.<br>  Brendum (bren-dum) - This sounds like a very strong name. I love how all of these are so different.<br>  Siego (like diego but with an s) -This is my favorite of the boy's names. It's very cute. <br>  Alisher - This is my second favorite of these. It just sounds...I don't really know why I like it. Again, I really like your name choices, they're very unique and help show your and your husbands different backgrounds.|`|0fys57BNaa	I'll be honest, I'm not a big fan of any of these but I can definitely say don't go with Brendum - having a name with the word dum will make him an open target with kids<br>  <br>  I would go for: Siayla for your girl and Jerseron if it's a boy. :)|`|1lBoPld5aa	I like Siayla as a girls name and Alisher as a boys name...<br>  <br>  But what about Felicia as a girls name and Damien as a boys name?|`|wDsw9thcaa	I like them all I like unique names!|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I'm all for unique names, but I think there is a difference between unique and ridiculous/made-up.

Really pretty!|`|GCqmaDfSaa	Siayla--will be mispronounced her whole life<br>  akira--pretty but sounds like an asian name<br>  harlow--it sounds too masculine for a girl to me<br>  <br>  jerseron--don't like it<br>  brendum--people will always say brendon<br>  siego--don't like it<br>  alisher--don't like it|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I would say Harlow for a girl, and Alisher for the boy.

Siayla is cute, Akira sounds too muck like a star wars type name. Seigo is cute.|`|5i4vUQhgaa	i not sure of these names , but definitely not Alisher that sounds girly or sounds like a package of licorice like twizzlers or something.

The classic style of Elizabeth complements the more modern style of Alexa.

FLOjzbKEaa	What kind of family history you talking about?
wM0Jce76aa	What's the difference between pregnancy tests that check urine and those that test blood? Which one is better?<br>  <br>  There are two types of pregnancy tests. One tests the blood for the pregnancy hormone, hCG. The other checks the urine for this hormone. You can do a urine test at home with a home pregnancy test. You need to see a doctor to have blood tests.<br>  <br>  These days, most women first use home pregnancy tests (HPT) to find out if they are pregnant. HPTs are inexpensive, private, and easy to use. Urine tests will be able to tell if you're pregnant about 2 weeks after ovulation. Some more sensitive urine tests claim that they can tell if you are pregnant as early as one day after a missed period.<br>  <br>  If a HPT says you are pregnant, you should call your doctor right away. You doctor can use a more sensitive test along with a pelvic exam to tell for sure if you're pregnant. Seeing your doctor early on in your pregnancy will help you and your baby stay healthy.<br>  <br>  Doctors use two types of blood tests to check for pregnancy. Blood tests can pick up hCG earlier in a pregnancy than urine tests can. Blood tests can tell if you are pregnant about 6 to 8 days after you ovulate (or release an egg from an ovary). A quantitative blood test (or the beta hCG test) measures the exact amount of hCG in your blood. So it can find even tiny amounts of hCG. This makes it very accurate. Qualitative hCG blood tests just check to see if the pregnancy hormone is present or not. So it gives a yes or no answer. The qualitative hCG blood test is about as accurate as a urine test.|`|Axle82kMaa	If you could then it'd come with a needle for you to draw the blood.<br>  <br>  No duh. It says on the package for urine only..|`|ShdV8jm4aa	It reads the PH balance & hormones it your urine. I don't believe that would be wise.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	No, that won't work.|`|ymyUynI6aa	No, and why would u want to?|`|fKZJYqDraa	no. hope this helps :)|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	No, these tests are made for testing hormone levels in urine. If you want a blood test you should go to a dr. A blood test will test the same hormone levels, but a different way.|`|nhhCow4haa	Look at the website www.peeonastick.com they do experiments with pregnancy tests. there is one on there with blood|`|kG6VWsGvaa	No, you might as well just get a blood test at the doctor's.<br>  <br>  I imagine it's much easier to just take a piss on the stick than having to draw blood. Stick with the urine.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I'm pretty sure that it is meant for urine or they would have a test out for a pin prick blood test etc. I think the hormone is detected diferently in urine than blood|`|loqsl5xXaa	no, at home test are done with urine....... u need to go to the dr if you want it tested by blood.|`|HM0cxcahaa	the tests are designed for urine, if you want a blood test go to your doctor

eTPJNcilaa	whats worse is having your best friend call  you up and announce her BFP ! This is worse because her and her hubby where on the birth control pill and not even trying!!!! She knows that I have been an agony for almost 2 years of ttc with no luck. This just made today suck! Of course when she called she had to repeat it about 5 times how much of a surprise it was since she was on the pill and not even trying. Okay now I am majorly venting but I am so upset. Then she had the nerve to tell me that I need to "get on it" so we could be pregnant together, AAAHHHH! I literally screamed when I hung up the phone. How insensitive ? Anyways Im truly sorry for your BFN because I know exactly how you feel.|`|DsvT9jJ4aa	I know ur u might tell me that im a idiot...But im in the same boat and i know how u feel but atleast u are fertil i have PCOS like the other girl and it sux baddd and i also only have 1 ovary and just had polyps removed from my uterus...So what are the chances for me? lol...But i just think to myself im sure that when the time is right it will happen...So please smile and be happen because this is the fun part, trying to get prego and then being prego..Enjoy it as much as u can and one day you will look back and see how the wait was worth the while...Best of luck :)|`|HQE8Yvicaa	Sorry to hear that!!

My birthday is in a few days too!<br>  <br>   I know how hard the BFN. I was TTC for 3 years with nothing and in November they tried to fix my blocked tubes and they ended up removing them! BFN are bad but being told you will never have a chance to have a baby the old fashion way is way harder and then finding out IVF will cost me about 15000,00 and knowing that you will never be able to save that kind of money eats me up every day! <br>  <br>  Good luck and  ALL MY STICKY BABY DUST YOUR WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Have you read the book “the infertility cure”!

She won't really talk about it to me (which I think is silly since we're both going through similar situations and have known each other for over a decade!) I wish I had a friend that could understand what we're all going through on here. Most of my gf's had the "oops" and so they can't understand why I'm having such an issue.<br>  <br>  UGH! Go have a nice glass of wine....or a few.. ;)|`|h4UzjZVnaa	Probably a miscarriage is slightly worse. That's my fear.

That is rotten timing :( But I want to wish you a very happy birthday! Just try to make the best of it, as difficult as it may seem. <br>  <br>  The month of December, we had a really good feeling that we hit it lucky. AF came for me on Christmas Eve. We were crushed!! And she came to crash the party while we were exchanging gifts, apparently she couldn't wait to drop of her gift to me. Booooo. I know how you feel, you hang in there, hun!!<br>  <br>  I am sending you all the baby dust in the world. Lots of hugs for you too :) I'll sing you happy birthday if it makes ya feel better ;)

My boyfriend loves the name for a boy and I on the other hand always loved Jaide or any kind of name similar. Its very pretty and unique! Go for it!|`|kLUIBz9Haa	Hunny no offense, but the spelling made me excited for another name before I read it correctly. I thought it was Jailyn or something. Nope. Even though that spelling looks feminine, Jayden is a very masculine name in the minds of most people.<br>  <br>  Including mine and your boyfriend's.|`|g7wQij2Oaa	i absolutely love it for a girl. and i like your spelling.<br>  but it's not bad for a boy (i would use a different spelling of course.. Jaden probably)<br>  <br>  :)|`|35kVNi5oaa	I think of a girl, because i think of Jade when i here it.|`|TNytY4XBaa	I think its cute and to be honest the spelling you are using a girl popped in my head right away!|`|fAIKG9Iyaa	To be honest a boy!|`|ljwi8J0aaa	hmmm... well i think it can be a girl or boys name <br>  <br>  but what about jaylen for a girl|`|JGS287Eeaa	girl|`|QcvG6LXDaa	Jaden i think is so cute for a girl,<br>  and for a boy i think Caiden is similar but more boyish!|`|EDlzfDYBaa	the spelling says girl. It's pretty.|`|qPNWOwvLaa	I think that is so cute. I love guys names for girls. like Jordan and Kyle...|`|DHwPgw9iaa	To me, spelled like that, it's definitely a girl's name!|`|xglOR1bXaa	UGHHH that names needs to be retired!!!!!!!! please dont--<br>  <br>  consider<br>  <br>  Jade, Jayla, Jaycee, Jaylee, Jane, Jada, Jayce.<br>  <br>  :)|`|0d1b5fcc305ead0ef5c939b96424f4b2aa	I only know of one celebrity with a son named Jadan and it's a variation of his wife's name for his son so it's a boy's name.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	why can't you spell it right?<br>  that's just so mean to do to your kid<br>  <br>  also, isn't that a boy's name?|`|pw3y3Eo0aa	girl|`|DP48dIxhaa	I think it's more of a girls name cause of Jade...however I don't like the name. What about Jade or Jaydah????
o1yy6KABaa	If you havent had a period then yes take another test- and if it doesnt arrive in the next week or so then see your doc and ask for a blood test.<br>  Remember too that alot of early pregnancy symptoms can be the same as PMS (easier said than done !) <br>  But I do hope this is your BFP! Baby dust to you!|`|rVsW4ESTaa	Poor thing.  You sound desperate.  Take a test and be a big girl about it if it comes back negative.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can imagine that you are pregnant.  When you are sooo wanting a baby.  This happened to me.   But be patient and it will happen.|`|oPLVIJ4haa	all of those symptoms i also had after the depo shot, my doc said they were normal she said it was my hormones,i hav 2 children and with both pregnancies i didnt go up a full boob size and i didnt get cravings until about 7mths,if i were u i'd got 2 ur doc and hav a blood test, my periods r still all over the place and i still get those symptoms plus heartburn and ive been off the shot now 4 13mths!  good luck 2 u if ur trying 2 concieve.. i hope ive helped a little bit, take care x
bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Sometimes Mom's don't understand.  We don't know everything in the whole world.  However, ask your Mom to take you to a doctor and have him explain how serious this matter is.  Also, the doctor may have a way to help you feel better about life.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	Mums don't know everything, they just wish they did. If you are depressed every day, I'd suggest you look at your diet. A junky diet will make your body sluggish and you'll feel depressed. Look at what you can change in your life first, then if you are still feeling that way, ask for more help. Your mum might not understand your emotional state, but I'm sure she'll be willing to support you in eating healthier. Eating is something mothers do understand!|`|WjSJBWl7aa	She can't comprehend that sort of pain. Find someone who does [a professional in this area].<br>  <br>  <br>  I've been down that road too honey.. but I didn't see a councilor and I regret it.. I managed to stop via willpower but.. it's still a daily struggle. A professional will help you get through this better.|`|GUuFKaaiaa	have you explained to her how serious the matter is? if it can't get through to her maybe talk to a school counselor if you have one or another trusted adult|`|ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	Some people just can't see beyond their own conceptions.  Seek a councilor for the help you need.|`|slU0pWMOaa	hey hun<br>  I just want you to stay Strong and think about the positive things, If your mom doesn't get you don't give up. You can ask a teacher that you think you can trust or ask someone in your family other then your mother maybe an older cousin or a close friend<br>  I might not understand what kind of relationship you have with your mom and how you feel about it but really try to sit down with your mom and tell her right into her face how you feel. Spill your feelings out. Don't be afraid, Make her understand|`|FWkLDcqOaa	You need to explain to her that it's a very serious matter. I have a friend who was just recently put in a mental institution because her mother didn't believe anything was really wrong with her and it got to the point where it was so terrible that she almost died.<br>  Please don't let that happen to you. If your mother won't listen, try talking to another adult, like your school councilor(sp?) or another family member. The councilor would most likely be willing to get you help. If still nothing works, go to the doctor/hospital/etc. yourself and tell them you feel your in serious need of help and that no one will listen to you.|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	See your school consular, they'll convey the importance to your mom|`|aSuLnvoSaa	go to a school counselor.... she'll probably get ahold of your mom and put a serious perspective on things for her...
ocwetmQuaa	What makes you think he DOESN'T have control of things?<br>  He has your plastic and your blessing.<br>  He's a jerk and you're a fool.|`|125baa5bf060d0a198bc94914f749bacaa	Like ... uhhh ... never ... he never has ... why would he now? Prepare for more of the same and worse ... where do you think he goes when he's out all night? ... get your head out of your butt my dear ... you'll soon have 2 babies to look after and one's gonna break your heart for sure ... good luck ...|`|yKS2UI87aa	Take away the credit cards (if he can't pay for them, he can't use them) You need to give him an ultimatum: get job, and contribute to the house or leave. If he won't work then you will actually save money by kicking his useless a** to the curb. Sorry for being so blunt be I do not like freeloaders whether they are male or female.|`|VlYMcVKlaa	he better does soon, i would kick my man if he would do that right now, tell him to help u out
cD3IhO8Jaa	una vecchia ostetrica mia amica mi disse che i bimbi concepiti durante la luna calante erano sicuramente di sesso feminile, in luna crescente di sesso maschile...poi però dipende dalla durata del ciclo, dalla sua regolarità, dalla tua alimentazione..ma se il ciclo è regolare, dava il 100% di riuscita!!!<br>  insomma, tante volte sinceramente ci ha azzeccato...più che meno..davvero...anche con me...<br>  ma sono d'accordo che comunque se vuoi un bimbo, venga quel che vuole basta che sia sano...e che tu abbia tanto amore da dargli...<br>  <br>  se poi il problema è genetico per qualche malattia trasmissibile, allora il discorso si fa serio e ti consiglio di rivolgerti ad un ginecologo bravo e sensibile...<br>  <br>  ultima cosa... un aneddoto moooolto esplicativo... <br>   un'altra mia amica  aspettava due gemelli...sperava che fossero femmine, ma erano maschi e nemmeno monozigoti...allora lei molto diplomatica e comunque felice, disse una frase rimasta nella storia....beh, speriamo che almeno uno dei due sia gay....<br>  baci!!!!

SQj1lBQIaa	There are too many scratches, too far apart for it to have been done by the dog. The symmetry also shows that they were intentional. However, they are more like scratches than deep cuts, which from my experience indicates that she has probably just started this recently. Usually, people who cut themselves start small, and when the cutting fails to achieve the desired effect, they escalate it. <br>  <br>  You should definitely approach your daughter about this, but be VERY careful. Cutters usually suffer from anxiety disorders, and if she perceives your approach as threatening in any way she may retreat from you and you won't make any progress. Before you ask her outright about the cutting, try to have a nice talk with her about how she's been feeling lately. <br>  <br>  Cutting can be considered kind of like a symptom of an emotional problem or brain chemistry disorder like depression. People with depression or anxiety disorders sometimes feel overwhelmed with emotion that they don't know how to handle, and they feel like they have a lack of control over their lives. Cutting is a way for them to be in control of their body and their emotions, and a way for them to express confusing emotional pain. In some ways it's similar to an eating disorder.<br>  <br>  If you can get her to admit that she hasn't been feeling great lately, offer to take her to a counselor or someone to talk to. Make sure she knows that it's not because you think she's crazy, and it's just nice to have someone who's "outside" of her life and drama to talk to. Counseling would be a major step in helping your daughter, and the counselor may be able to help you figure out healthier ways for your daughter to deal with her emotions, such as through art or exercise. <br>  <br>  Most importantly, make sure your daughter knows that you're there for her through everything, and you just want to help her, not "fix" her.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	sheeeee za cutter alright|`|7Vlo2iZtaa	Why do you think she wore a dog mask on purpose? I guess I might be pretty upset if my daughter wore a dog mask, but you know how kids are.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Sometimes cutters want other people to see their cuts because they need help but don't know exactly how to ask for it. She may or may not have done it on purpose, but to handle the situation, sit and talk with your daughter. Communication is key.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Yes that had to be done on purpose. I would definitely talk to her as soon as you can and look into getting her some help. I'm sorry I know that's got to be a scary thing to see! Good luck to you!|`|z7BTeUKvaa	I don't know.  I'd just ask her what happened.  If her story is suspect, get her in therapy.|`|8JDxBlcVaa	it looks like it was on purpose.<br>  <br>  i would talk to her about it.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	Yeah, I'm sorry honey, it looks like she did it on purpose.  What's more is, I think that pic is an attempt to "show it off" to her friends.  Some kids think cutting is cool.  She might just be trying to fit in with a crowd or it could be much more serious.  Either way I would take her to her pediatrician and he/she can refer you to the right help.  Good luck and don't worry yourself too much b/c you are being an observant parent and hopefully you have headed this problem off before it got worse.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I would ask her, confront her and ask her why she feels the need to cause herself harm. I would be a little worried, they say people that cut themselves and what not have high levels of anxiety. And that they dont know how to handle problems so the anxiety gets worse and the only way to deal with it is to cause themselves harm.|`|mQhqRbRQaa	Talk to her as soon as possible.  Don't sound angry, don't sound upset. Just show her you are her friend, and that you are here to help her.  Don't make her feel scared.  Try to get down to the bottom as to how it started.  If you need help getting her to open up to you, come in the room and ask her how her school been going, friends boys etc.  Talk to her about something she would WANT to talk about.  <br>  Don't panic though.  It's not too late to stop it.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Well unless the blade of the knife or a razor blade fell on her arm multiple times, and I sure that didn't happen, I would most definitely say she did it on purpose. Just talk to her.|`|yKS2UI87aa	It looks like she is cutting herself. Talk to her and enroll her in counseling. The sooner the better.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	You need to tell your husband/her father what you saw and handle this immediately.  She needs help right now.|`|LTTips1vaa	I would flat out ask your daughter.  If not make observations over the next couple days of her body.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	My dog scratches me all the time it's nothing.|`|Yl9741EZaa	Honestly? It probably was, but if your thinking my daughter is really upset about something then- Well it is probably over nothing.<br>  Like everything with teenage girls these days and times.<br>  <br>  But people are waaaay over reacting these days!!<br>  The amount of girls that cut themselves is very high, and its usually only once and they never do it again realising how stupid it was,<br>  <br>  But i know where shes coming from and if my mum started harrasing me about why i'm so sad?<br>  It wouldn't make her feel any better. Teens are at the age of trying to detatch from their parents, just a phase dont worry.<br>  <br>  So observe her, ask if anythings up without letting up that you know what she did.<br>  Laugh with her more, be more interested in her life and whats going on [try avoiding nosy]<br>  <br>  And Best Wishes xx|`|7ax0vlFIaa	It could've been the dog, too. Maybe that's not even her in the picture? Either way, you should ask her if everything's fine and make sure she knows that she can talk to you about anything.|`|QjV43r2Caa	I definately agree with the other 2 answers!|`|Zw7IVfqeaa	Whoa! That does look purposeful, since they are in a series of straight lines. <br>  <br>  I would talk to her immediately about it and find out why she is cutting herself. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	Yup that is intentional cutting. It's either a cry for help or she is seriously depressed. Either way you should take her to a consular. Good luck|`|7iPGTHXkaa	looks like it, too many scratches for a dogs claw|`|o0MQRIIKaa	idk.
aCUHzMrmaa	Mine is 3 now i miss her being a baby SO much, anyway I used to love just showing her new stuff outside, like rain, animals, things in life. Watching someone experience something for the first time in their life is so incredible.  I loved when she'd just look at me and like i know she couldnt talk but i knew she understood what i was saying, just a really cool thing.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	I love to lay down in the bad with my 15 months old and just cuddle. She loves to hug me and it's such a beautiful feeling :)
ScZPVCUpaa	I used to kiss the air as I leaned down closer and closer to his cute little face.  Then I would do a big, noisy kiss on his head and he would giggle like crazy.  And say "do it again, mommy".<br>  <br>  God, I miss those days, you are so lucky to be living this amazing time with your child.|`|Xhgq35dNaa	With my 2.5 year old daughter my favorite thing to do with her is read books.  She loves them so much and it is a great time to snuggle with her.  With my 1 year old son I love kissing his chubby little neck...he is so ticklish that he giggles.  Its cute!

That's a lot of sweet tea.  I am guessing it was good?  lol.|`|WIeCX71Daa	No I don't think it is bad, but it has given me an idea on how to stay awake all night and play on answers. Uh oh, look out people, you're gonna be in trouble.  Lmao|`|LSJyE4d0aa	No, you will just pee a whole lot more and the caffeine may keep you up.|`|9NXtWzUOaa	i drank a whole gallon of vodka in about 30 minutes.|`|dZ8y8KwHaa	Do you feel bad? There's people here at work who drink diet coke practically 24-7.|`|XgyHPhMzaa	I DRINK A LOT OF TEA AND I AM STILL ALIVE<br>  sorry about the caps|`|xVEqBjDVaa	for your teeth, and you'll probably be peeing a lot! lol|`|bYVsQKVZaa	only ur teeth its kinda stupid though|`|AA11210211	oh yeah it is SO bad!! lol That's okay I have drank a 12 pack of DP and a latte today!!

d933e4b97b43aa7bfb10ac2da32dceb4aa	My daughter is 8 and she has several Bratz dolls, both boys and girls. However, her interest in them peaked around age 7 and she does not really play with them much any more. And amazingly, she played with them for about 3 years and never turned into a hooker! <br>  I respect the right of all parents to choose what their kids play with but the fear of these little toys is so over blown that it borders on the ridiculous. My daughter has never once tried to dress like them, or thought of them as "role models". They are just toys.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	No...no way...no how!<br>  <br>  My niece had them, and I was playing with her after Christmas one year and decided my child could never have them.  The clothes are slutty, and they put excessive make up on these dolls.  The doll practically says "Hey little girl, dress like a hooker and go out with boys all the time, even if you are only 7"<br>  <br>  I remember back in the day when they harped on barbie for giving girls a bad body image and not wanting barbie to be a role model.  Thus why her bust size was decreased and waste is more natural. (if any of you played with barbies when you were little you would notice lol)<br>  <br>  I would rather mine play with the busty twig barbie who at least covered her goodies, than with a bratz doll.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	My niece is 7 and my sister won't allow them in the house. She has Barbies and some HSM dolls which she loves.<br>  She knows that Bratz ain't going to happen for her - she'll say "Mommy, don't look in that aisle, you won't like what's there!"<br>  I see no need for them. There are plenty of other dolls that aren't a pedophile's dream|`|bSHhWXfPaa	well i dont have children of my own yet but i ahve a sister. she mur interested in barbie and princesses more than bratz. but she has 2 that my cousin bought her for christmas and b-day|`|qLuodu3Raa	9 and i dont know how many a bunch that her cousin gave her and a few she got for christmas last year|`|840e6a182a0c8998e0fc8fdf077673a2aa	Yes my 8 year old has a bunch of them.|`|P9GQydOjaa	well....i have sisters.....when they were small (well they are) but....they don't really play cause it doesn't interest them anymore!! Soz :(|`|VR9KhbEgaa	my 6 year old daughter has at least 10 Bratz dolls.|`|rB3cyt0Paa	Here you can start your paper:<br>  <br>  Bratz are to grown up. They were make-up and skimpy clothes and their designed for 7 year olds? That's outrageous. And we try to keep kids away from that but the Doll Company wants us to keep producing Bratz for little girls when they are like 10 years older than them|`|TK03jZTuaa	My daughter is 10 years old and has three now. I never allowed them in my house for the reasons others ahve already listed. But for her 9th birthday my not so darling sister bought her some.<br>  I was furious but decided to let her keep the dolls anyhow.|`|AAlB49iraa	i won't permit my daughter to have them....not that's she's ever even asked.... who wants their 7 year old thinking this is the cool way to look. All painted up and half naked? no thank you.|`|2idnfGvmaa	My sister is 10 and she has 5 girls and 2 boys! the amount of clothes she has for them is ridiculous too, They all come with like 2 sets of clothes plus top ups!

It's a sporty one - dressed up for soccer.  She's never even taken it out of it's box.  She's just not into playing with dolls.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	No.  I believe those "Bratz" (what a horrible name to call a doll anyway) are horrible examples for young children.  It teaches them to:<br>  <br>  -Dress inappropriately/provocatively<br>  -To wear heavy eye make up<br>  <br>  And I dislike that "pouty" diva look on the dolls faces.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	None of the girls in my family have them- we all have Barbie by preference, I'm a third generation avid collector of Barbie myself. <br>  Bratz dolls are fugly according to my eight year old neice (fugly is a combo of a naughty word and ugly that means really ugly, just in case the term is unfamiliar)<br>  The Bratz accesories are pretty good though, I've purchased the remote control cars even though they are too small for Barbie!|`|AA10943329	no i hate Bratz and my daughter doesn't play with dolls. she is more an arty kid.

I would suggest using the Fertility Awareness Method (ie charting) to ttc. It may work if nothing else has. If anything, it will let you get to know you're body better. There may be a problem, or maybe poor timing. :)
kHLwlNA5aa	I love the name Elizabeth. It sounds like the qualities would be refined, articulate and pretty.

85992129b5c476106e70ef2bffdd1bd0aa	Lo trovo inappropriato, solo per rincorrere l'originalità ad ogni costo o per chiamare il figlio col nome dell'attore di turno (e poi magari questo da grande fa l'idraulico!!!).

JI7NQ9TNaa	Birth.<br>  <br>  I never considered dressing twins the same as "cute".<br>  Children, even identical twins later struggle establish a separate identity.<br>  So how about letting them dress the way they want...instead of pushing the "cute" card any longer?<br>  <br>  I have twin brothers, btw...they HATED all the "matching outfit pics" of their childhood.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	It's cute when they are babies for special occassions, but honestly, buying them two of everything isn't necessary just because they are twins. Twin parents don't need two of every toy on the market. They are individuals and there is nothing wrong with buying each of them something different that meets their personality or interests. I would say when they start off to preschool around 3 or 4 it is a good time to stop the dressing alike though. They need a chance to be INDIVIDUALS and not always looked at or addressed as "the twins" in conversation or identity.  They were born twins, but it shouldn't define who they are as people.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	47|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Whenever they become more independent and want to dress in their own styles.  So if they still like to dress alike then go ahead and get them the matching outfits, but if they are past that stage and have their own preferences, buy them different things.|`|NuZjVW6vaa	Just because you buy them the same outfit does not mean they have to wear it on the same day. If their mom is still buying them the same outfits, I would go right ahead.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Birth.|`|AA12020110	Now,  start by buying different colored shirts for them  I bet they will 'trade' with each other sometimes.  <br>  <br>  Or take them to the store and let them each pick out what they want to wear.  <br>  <br>  Dressing them the same is easier, but they are going to start insisting on their own clothes soon. And twins may look alike but that is no promise hey will wear the same sized clothes for long.|`|AA12174100	I stopped when mine were 3 or 4 and started pre=school, I had them put in separate school classrooms too so they could have their own space. Now at 22, they have always tended to hang around the same kids but they are happy I gave them their own space.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Whenever they ask not to.  Some kids like it, some don't.  I know a pair of 10 year old girl twins who still love to dress alike.  Their choice- to them it's cute and fun.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	My five year old twin daughters love dressing the same. Maybe yours will too. If not then one could wear one one day and the other could wear one on a different day.|`|S4y7V4diaa	I think once they enter school they should have their own identities, only dress the same on special ocsassions maybe|`|45nSn7Rcaa	We have twin girls (16)...they were often in and still are often in matching clothes...but not always....it doesn't really matter except how they feel.|`|2FsNdcXEaa	I would say...five years ago.|`|tgtsbxpBaa	My answer on this is that once a child learns to dress themselves, then they should also have the choice of what to where - within reason.  For instance, I don't let my son wear a sweat shirt if it's 80 degrees or higher outside, and I won't let him wear shorts if it's under 70, nor will I let him wear pajamas or stained up clothing to school, etc.  However, from the vast amount of his wardrobe that leaves, he picks out his clothes and puts them on.  He's 5 now and has been doing this since he was 3 (or earlier).  <br>  <br>  Thus, if the twins CHOOSE to dress themselves the same, that's fine, but they shouldn't be forced into it.  Like others have said, sometimes for special occasions (like weddings, Christmas, etc) it can be fine, since they're going to have to be dressed up in clothes they probably don't like anyway - but other than that - let it be.  <br>  <br>  At this age I think is the time to let them learn the joys of being able to share and double the fun.  Instead of buying TWO of the same toy, buy complimentary toys (like two kinds of Nerf gun or a soccer ball and a football) or even better, two new board games or puzzles! That way they can learn that if they share, they get twice as much stuff!  <br>  <br>  P.S. - you don't want to be the aunt that ALWAYS gives clothes anyway.  Girls might like it, but boys will soon decide that your gift gets opened last.|`|T9fek24eaa	In my honest opinion I would never dress them alike. I am pregnant with triplets and giggled at the thought of dressing 3 babies in matching outfits but then I started thinking about how un-unique that could make a kid feel.  <br>  <br>  SO yes, I think 5 years old is plenty old enough to not buy them matching outfits or matching toys. They both have their own unique personalities, why not get them something they will each love, even if its not the same.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	my twins are 4, and i stopped doing that when they were like 3, because they are so individual that they don't like to wear the same things lol, i have two of a kind i know! but yeah,i think they are getting to the age where they are both really developing a big personality and will want seperate stuff.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	I think that if them or their parents dnt want to do that twin thing. Otherwise if everybody is fine with it then just go alon with it but if u don't want to dress them alike then I would get the two different outfits and a toy that they dig.|`|2VozF50saa	as long as they enjoy wearing matching outfits let em! go ahead and buy them twin outfits, but i'd say buy them different toys. no one like to get the same gifts as everyone else year after year. cloths r ok to match as long as the twins r ok about it! :)|`|NfW5GzESaa	im a twin and i didn't like waring the same cloths when i was young. go ahead and get them the same outfit. its the moms choice to dress them the same. and if she doesn't they dont have to ware it the same day|`|ko3Larigaa	Yea <br>  <br>  as long as they havent complained yet and the mother is still allowing it then <br>  <br>  buy them matching outfits <br>  <br>  its fine eventually they will grow out of matching but I know 13 year old twins who still dress a like|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Personally, I would never consider dressing them the same. It is so tacky and impersonal.|`|GPkcg8Rqaa	I personally agree with you...by 5 it's time to start giving them different things...|`|ceVb8qdNaa	birth dressing them the same robs them of a chance to develop their own personality|`|8oCjcS1Raa	probably about 5 years ago
RK04Jktraa	Everyone here needs to watch "Kinsey", sleep, and restate their answers.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Ok so there is like a 1% chance to be in love at 15 and most teenagers think they are in love all the time but things change when you grow up. Most teenagers are incapable of looking at the long term effects of their decisions like sex (sex=babies) and almost every teenager is gonna say they are in love and they will be together forever, thats been a proven fact, its the undeveloped brain of a child, the brain dose not compleetly develope until age 25. Yes you can love at a young age but that dosent mean your gonna be together forever and they say I love you and then break up and say i never really loved you, dont tell us "dont you dare say" because hunny you are on Y!A and your gonna get critisizm whether you like it or not and if you cant handle it dont come on here. 15 is to young to be having sex. You sould not have sex unless you are mature enough to handle it. If you become pregnant what would you do? run to the abortion clinic? thats not a mature adult, and adults who do that because they were stupid and have sex are adults, but not mature ones. You old enough to get a job? support a baby, because thats what sex is for to make children, people use it for pleasure but its to reproduce as nature intended. And i say screw the whole "wait till marriage thing" that is a personal choice and has nothing to do with sex, unless you are religious. just because you have been together for a year dosent mean to much, it may at 15 most relationships last 2 or 3 months, but you may intend to spend the rest of your lives together and thats fine as long as you know its not a garentee and people change and grow apart, things happen and sometimes thats not possible, forever is a very long time.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If your gonna have sex, then go ahead and have sex, but use protection birth control  AND condoms, i used that and i still got pregnant, the pull out method dose not do squat there is precum and a guy can not feel that come out<br>  <br>  you can get pregnant on birth control and using condoms, you can get pregnant if you use all the protection combined, you can get pregnant if you have your period<br>  you can get pregnant from precum<br>  you can get pregnant in water<br>  you can get pregnant if the girl is on top<br>  you can get pregnant if the girl is on bottom<br>  you can get pregnant anytime the penis goes into the vagina<br>  <br>  <br>  BEFORE YOU HAVE SEX OF ANY KIND, SIT DOWN AND TALK TO YOUR PARTNER ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU GOT PREGNANT, MAKE SURE YOU BOTH GET TESTED FOR STD'S BEFORE YOU HAVE SEX<br>  <br>  <br>  ALWAYS TALK BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING WITH EACH OTHER<br>  <br>  <br>  LOVE AND SEX ARE NOT THE SAME THING|`|kRaVa0Wraa	if you say "no haters" youre not going to have a variety of opinions...which is pretty pointless if youre asking a question based on our opinion.<br>  <br>  a 15 year old doesnt know what love is.|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	Well I lost my virginity at 15, and I wasn't in love...I barely knew the guy, since then I have had multiple sex partners, but I have only been in love with one of them. I know I'm a ****, no need to call me one, I won't really admit on here to how many guys I have slept with, but I will say its more than 10 and less than 20.<br>  <br>  I don't think it is bad to lose your virginity when you are young, and If you only have sex with one guy then I don't think its slutty at all.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Can you tell me what's like to be in love without saying he's sooo hot or sexy and he makes you feel special? <br>  You can be in love with someone and still wait to have sex. Wanting to have sex has a lot to do with lust and chemistry..<br>  A lot of people in their 20's have sex with someone they think they will marry,only to have the relationship end six or eight months later.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	as long as both the girl and boy are using protection (condom AND birth control) then I don't see the issue<br>  <br>  only if they are BOTH being used.  I don't even care if they are "in love"<br>  I was 15 when I lost my virginity.  I think I was a bit young looking back at it now, but there was no way to tell me that when I was 15!  BUT, at least I planned it out and talked about it with my more experienced friends.  They made sure we were both protected.<br>  <br>  the issue is not age and sex or love and sex....it's stupidity and sex. JUST BE PROTECTED EVERY TIME!<br>  <br>  I'm 24yrs old now (FYI)|`|tbeO3Lataa	I am going to give you my personal opinion here, and you may not like what I have to say.<br>  <br>  Can you be in love? Maybe. But it doesn't matter. At fifteen, a person does not have the life experience to know what love is. How can you "be in love" if you don't have much to compare it to? Not to mention, this feeling of being "in love" can be a horribly bad thing. So many girls (many that I have known) meet a guy, go crazy for him, and then are willing to do just about anything.<br>  <br>  Birth control and STD protection is another matter. I am fifteen and very responsible, and even I don't always remember to take my daily medication. It is too much to expect a teenage girl that young will remember, not to mention use a condom correctly (if at all), and know what to do if something fails.<br>  <br>  On a third note, sex is physical certainly, but it is also emotional. No fifteen-year-old is emotionally mature enough to be involved in that kind of emotional connection. Think about it. During sex, you give up your entire body to the person you are with. No matter how "in love" you are, this is hard.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	ok but the real question is how many 15 year olds really know what the difference from loving someone is and actually being in love?<br>  <br>  People always mistake the two no matter the age...We all just have to realize that self love comes first and if we start having sex at such a young age there's a high chance your number of sexual partners will grow... I've learned the more sexual partners you have the harder it will be to love someone as well as yourself.|`|DhZ5smpWaa	The people who you call haters, are right. Sex isn't right at such young age. And no, your only in puppy love. How the hell can you be "real" love when yet still haven't really experience life. You've only be living for 15 years. No sex, even if your supposedly in "love". So much consequences happen when you have sex, and 15 is too young to face the consequences. You call it love, I'd call it hormones running a muck.|`|0kWkX8yiaa	no...if they feel they are in love then they should go for it! do not let age hold you back...unless you are 13 and younger...then it gets a little weird!|`|9z5YJKqLaa	thats the problem.<br>  people tie in sex with love<br>  thats not always the case|`|FN9CSRw0aa	It doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks, it's up to you wether or not you would like to take that next step. I believe in sex before marriage, you need to get out there and experience life first otherwise you aren't going to know what else is out there.<br>  <br>  Love is different to sex and always will be and I know that 15 year olds can be in love because I've been in love since I was 15 and I'm now 19, thats 4 years and thats a long time.<br>  <br>  Don't stress about it, you will have many opinions but you just trust in yourself and your partner and just be careful. It's good sex if it is safe sex.|`|b326b96181c4a84b24f503115e014b7daa	For one, Learn some manners. I'm an adult, and I've been in this so called "love" at 15....So don't you go off thinking that you know everything...<br>  <br>  two. SEX is something that CAN wait. Young people think (teenagers...i should say) That they need to have everything NOW or the world will end, or people won't think they are cool, people will think of them as dorks, prudes, whatever...<br>  <br>  Guess what...High school/middle school, doesn't last forever. <br>  <br>  And also guess what...if you WAITED till you were older...you enjoy it more...<br>  <br>  Now, as for love... LOVE is a hard concept to grasp for a young girl...I was in "Love" once...I stayed that way for 4 years, I married him..and he abused the **** out of me because I thought that that was how love was supposed to be. I'm divorced, on my own, and better off. I should have waited. Lust and Love are two things girls get confused....when you're older...you'll understand. <br>  <br>  And as for "Waiting till marriage" So what if someone who didn't wait tells you that its a good idea to wait...it's called "Experience" I didn't wait..so what? But I will tell my son that it is worth the wait. Why? Because I wish I had done so..So...please, call me a hypocrite...<br>  <br>  Anyway..You need to stop being so...defensive about this. People are going to have differnt thoughts on this subject, and by saying "NO HATERS" you are inviting more trouble than you thought you were not going to have. Accept others for their ideas and move on...(again, something you'll learn as an adult)|`|naPYuaDQaa	Your 15 and already decided to spend your life with them?<br>  Don't be so sure, it's usually 3-5 years to decide on that.<br>  <br>  Here's a helpful tip with guys: They plan on settling down when THEY want to settle down, not when you want to. Are you sure your boyfriend wants to get married to you and live together and start a family? Whoa! Imagine agreeing to THAT in high school!<br>  <br>  Stay high school sweethearts, if your truly in love make it a special moment in your life you'll always remember, like sex on prom night or or on the night of proposal or after a romantic evening.<br>  <br>  People say wait till marraige because they regret not doing so or they got pregnant and the bf left them or other worse-case scenarios. Alot of people REALLY regret having sex so young. And most people aren't going to believe you when you say you're truly in love because in many cases thats what they all say. <br>  <br>  I'm surprised no one masturbates anymore, it's really the safest sex and it's not just for guys!<br>  <br>  But if you badly want to have sex with this person: get on birth control, wear a condom and make sure there's no holes in it or it doesn't break, wear a "girl condom"...WEAR PROTECTION!!!|`|nTSjPOYQaa	A lot of emotions come with having sex; attachment, fear, love, etc. It can make a nice relationship very complicated. BUT, if you've talked to your partner ahead of time concerning birth control, and previous relationships/sex partners, I think its ok to have premarital sex if you are in a committed relationship. (And I mean being with each other for quite some time before having sex. Months, years.) Being prepared is just very very important. Always remember you could get pregnant or an STD.|`|GRdK217aaa	ok, first i dont think its wrong but i dont think its right either, however <br>  there are many things that come along with sex, suck as std's wacth the movie " kids" its about aids, the wacth the movie pregnat at 15 and then wacth juno and then ask that question, bottom line you should wait and no it dosent make you a ****|`|ubP7Lgxeaa	its good to be having sex at 15 if you are happy and feel special, if you feel confident and trust your guy, if its not at a party when you are drunk..and if you are happy with your contraceptive methods.

I was 15 the first time and thought I was in love. I regret it now, but I learned from it. I wish that people would wait until they were older, but that is not going to happen. I am happy that I did not wait until mariage. Don't get me wrong, I love my husband, but, I did my thing before marriage, so that after marriage, I would mess around with other guys. Not all girls that have sex are sluts, everyone knows the ones that are and the ones that aren't. When I have children, I hope they will wait until they are older than 15, but I will not hate them or judge them on it. I will only give my opinion about it. To each their own. Every experience in life, good or bad, should be one where you can leaen something from it. As long as you learn from your mistakes, then that is all that is important.|`|wX46Gv4naa	Yes it's really wrong becuz most boys at that age are just trying to get some and say whatever the girl wants to hear cuz thier so vulnerable. I say wait until your older so you can know if its true love or something that will fade. Your body is precious and don't just give it to the guy who goes all but your so pretty i love you blahblahblah. If you wait you will feel more precious and sacred and your true love will feel that to. If he loves you so much then he should love you enough to wait.

Like OCD.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	Yes, it's normal two nieces and my daughter do it.|`|7dR0weDWaa	i think just keep an eye on her, but really its fine....my daughter, when she got slighty upset or frustrated would try to hurt her self, she'd hit, pull her hair, scratch and even try to bite her palms. i spoke to her pediatrician and she suggested that i put her in her crib whenever she did it and left her, so that she would learn that this was not acceptable and she wouldn't get attention from it. its been about a year, and sometimes my daughter will hit her head when shes mad, but she looks at me when she does it, as though shes hoping i'll give her what she wants.....i used to work in daycares, and have been around young children all my life, i've seen many children pull their hair when they get upset, just keep an eye out incase it gets worse.|`|lzviKPJWaa	its due to stress

O0clVP3Vaa	how bout Alonzo Callias<br>  i do like the name Alonzo|`|mZi7R0Enaa	my choice would be Callen Elias Alonzo!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Callen Elias Martinez|`|aWkp6AJOaa	you could also give him the middle name of Jose.  i named my first two children with the same middle name.  it's their middle name so no one would know unless you or the children told anyone, my girls actually like that they have it in common.  not that you should care you name your baby whatever you want to.  i think that callen is nice & unique.<br>  good luck & congrats on the baby!|`|VqcbRunXaa	Not really a fan of Alonzo but it depends on culture i guess.

I wouldn't worry about that as much as a really nice name.|`|QyjUYqfSaa	Callen i don't like<br>  Elias is too old fashioned. <br>  give him a name you both like and he won't feel left out. <br>  my cousin's name is Dahlia after my relative yuck!!!|`|bFP6jfvVaa	I prefer Elias Callen Alonzo.

There's no way to get three false negatives. It probably feels different for your boyfriend because of not wearing a condom. You probably need to start birth control to regulate your periods.
nZVmkZSBaa	Did you miss your period?<br>  <br>  If so, take a test in another week... <br>  <br>  If not, wait for it. Don't worry, because that will only delay your period further, and cause more worrying. :]<br>  <br>  And might I suggest, hmm, IDK, a CONDOM !!

4Yl2awlkaa	You may mention to your mom you have a question about your estrogen levels. Say something like<br>  <br>    "Mom, how much pain did you have in your breasts when you were pregnant with me?" <br>  or<br>   "Does breast cancer run in our family?"<br>  <br>  Most insurance companies pay for reductions if it's documented that you have pain and fatigue in your neck/upper back.  You may also want to speak with your gym teacher or other athletic coach (if you do participate in sports or other active things), and have your coach speak with your parents and say something like: <br>  <br>   "did you know (your name here) is complaining of back pain in gym class because she can't find a support bra that is adequate for her? Have you spoken with her Dr. about her neck/back pain? Otherwise she may need a Dr.s excuse note?"<br>  <br>  That may get their attention|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	just tell your mom that you want a breast reduction... it is not that hard. I knew a girl once, my girl scout leader's daughter, and she was a triple I..so HUGE. She got a reduction obviously and she has back pain too.|`|AA10953561	I know this is the last thing you want to hear, but at 16 you're not done growing. With your bra size being what it is, I fully support the idea of a breast reduction, but it might be a wise idea to wait until you're done growing, otherwise you may just go up again after a reduction. <br>  <br>  I'd bring it up with your mother first. She's female and understands what large breast can do to a woman's back. Men tend to just avoid the issue if it concerns their daughters. So just approach your mom and talk to her about the pain you feel in your back, your shoulders, and your neck. Then bring up the idea of a reduction and see what she says. Ultimately it's harming your health and the issue needs to be addressed.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon!|`|dPmK83UYaa	Maybe you should talk to your doctor first, just ask if you can talk to your doctor alone w/o your parents, don't be afraid, that way he can give you the medical view of your situation and you can hear it straight from the horses mouth! We all change, our bodies, throughout our lifetime. I am not the same person i was at 16, I evened out ok. And I've come to love my body. So make sure you get the right opinion.|`|wzjL2itMaa	Insurance will cover it since being that big can cause great pain. Just sit them both down and explain your reasons. You sound old enough to make an informed decsion and to discuss this with them|`|X4Dhx4uCaa	Don't get the surgery!! My sister did and the pain is way worse afterword.
jJjfeylmaa	i'm also against abortion but love debating so i'll try to help you out..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/pros-and-cons-about-abortion-3403.html" rel="nofollow">http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/p...</a><br>  <br>  Many a times, abortion helps to safeguard women's health. There are many women, who suffer from various hazardous medical conditions such as heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia, severe diabetes, etc. As these diseases can be life-threatening, an abortion often helps to avoid serious medical complications from childbirth. <br>  In male chauvinistic societies, women are considered nothing more than child bearing machines. Therefore, a right to abortion gives her an individual identity, as per which she can decide the fate of her child.    <br>  At times, abortion also helps in keeping a check on the size of the family. It can serve as a potent tool to undo mistakes, thereby preventing mothers to be forced for raising a child at a young age. <br>  The convenience of abortion provides the parents with an option of having a wanted child. In its absence, any unwanted pregnancy would lead to the birth of many children, who weren't wanted. This could immensely hamper the social strata of the society, having negative implications especially on child's psyche. <br>  Moreover, in cases where women are raped, getting pregnant with such a child is yet another brutality they would be forced to bear. Thus, the option of abortion is the best for them. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.health-directories.com/abortion-pro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.health-directories.com/aborti...</a>|`|JPCV48hHaa	If the fetus isn't developing a brain/spinal cord, an abortion is usually suggested.<br>  <br>  If a woman is raped, she may choose to have an abortion.  I've heard women say it's like being raped all over again to carry the man's fetus.<br>  <br>  A woman should have the right to choose what happens to her body.  <br>  <br>  If the fetus is dead, it may be possible for the mother to deliver, but some docs opt to perform the procedure.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Lastly, abortion isn't "good" per se.  It's not a day at the park, and it's a very hard decision to make.  Good reasons for having an abortion are few-and-far-between.  Good luck on your debate.|`|ko3Larigaa	I am 100% against abortion in all ways but in 8th grade I did a paper on it too.<br>  <br>  1) in the case of rape<br>  2) Government should not get in the way of what women do with their bodies<br>  3) incase of incest<br>  4) if the mother is in danger because of health reasons<br>  5) finacially unable to take care of child and for some reason whatsoever adoption is not an option <br>  <br>  All these reason protect the mother from pain and heartache and finacial problems|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	1. Un fit mothers will not be having and then abusing their babies.<br>  2. In cases of incest, rape, and child rape it is better for the mother's mental/phycial  health not to carry, deliver the child.<br>  3. In cases where pregnancy will be harmful or lethal to the mother.<br>  4. Severe disability<br>  5. If abortion were illegal it would create a black market for abortions, creating more crime and mal practice.|`|o40QqoQGaa	I just did a research project on abortion, and got an A, i found ALL the information i ever needed on this website, as well as citations, statistics, graphs, and it has both viewpoints.<br>  <br>  Check them out! <br>  <a href="http://find.galegroup.com/ovrc/start.do?prodId=OVRC&userGroupName=taco87864" rel="nofollow">http://find.galegroup.com/ovrc/start.do?...</a>  (click on abortion)|`|DydbT29Daa	i totally think abortion is not good but id help:<br>  * child havin problems 2 began with<br>  * cant support baby<br>  * dont know who the father is<br>  * scared it would b grown up in a bad area<br>  * not ready 2 b a mother<br>   <br>  i know my answers arent so good but hoped i helped<br>  good luck on gettin an A|`|hpR1BOYjaa	If you are using "yahoo" as a reference for a debate, your reference weight won't carry very far.  You need specific stories, original research and highly decorated doctors for resources.  <br>  <br>  Former debate teacher.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	Sorry, I got nothing.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	So, basically, you're the pro-choice person in the debate?<br>  <br>  1. If the pregnancy will harm the woman, she should be allowed an abortion. Not all women can handle a pregnancy (physically, mentally, and financially.)<br>  edit: this might help your debate too. Doctors often times don't allow child-less women under the age of 30 to get their tubes tied because maybe they'll change their mind. That doesn't change that sex is pleasurable and the woman still wants to enjoy it.<br>  <br>  2. Rape cases. If people discriminate against abortion because rape cases of pregnancy are rare, they're discriminating against minorities.<br>  <br>  3. Forcing a woman to have a baby she doesn't want to have, doesn't really equate to a proper home life usually.<br>  <br>  4. The world's overpopulated as it is. We don't need to force another life into this world.<br>  <br>  5. Birth control fails.<br>  <br>  6. I don't know how debate-able this is, but people who force a woman to birth. How likely is it they're going to help that child once it's actually been birthed?|`|rjVALevtaa	I'm probably the wrong person to answer this considering that I'm basically against abortion but here's a few reasons I can think of:<br>  <br>  In cases where the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy.<br>  In cases of rape, particularly incest.|`|xrAb9L7yaa	abortion is good because people need to have a free choice. everyone says its like murdering someone but its not. especially because now girls are getting pregnant younger and younger, they need that choice (for example if youre pregnant at 12 or 13. thats a whole different story from 16 or 17)|`|yKS2UI87aa	Well, sorry killing a baby can never be termed as "good" as you put it. I think you should change to Why abortion is bad and then go watch "the silent scream" then you will know why it's bad.|`|lkDco02jaa	abortion is awful. who ever gets an abortion is a murder. they are murdering thier own baby. its an awful thing by a long shot|`|lpuu8DIIaa	Women need to be able to choose what happens to their bodies.

If a woman is aware of her cycle interval and has a regular 28-day cycle, "you take that number [28] and subtract 14, and that should give you the approximate day of ovulation.

I think your husband should adopt her, if what you say about her father is true and he's out of the picture.  Of course, she should know where she came from, but a 5-year-old won't really understand how she has a different "dad" when the man she knows and loves as her father isn't her biological father.  She won't understand that!  Wait until she is a little older to tell her--I don't think never telling her is a good idea.  But I don't think she needs to know at 5.
wNGIhlM7aa	i had light cramping off and on from time to time up until the fourth month...make sure you sleep on your left side and drink lots of fluids|`|ksWm9eCBaa	I had horrible periods before I got preg and remember experiencing pretty bad cramping in the exact same area during 1st trimester. I remember calling my doc and (not asking, but) telling the nurse I was gonna "just take some ibuprofen for cramps, okay?" Within a nanosecond, that nurse put the doc onto the phone  (that was rare!) and she screamed at me:  "Don't you DARE!"  Geez....I was young/stupid..I didn't know!  (I could've damaged the baby's heart!!)<br>  I'm old & wise now...and my daughter just experienced it /w her preg;her doc told her the same thing mine did:  it's those big muscles that wrap around the lower back and around to front to 'hold' your uterus in place.  For some reason, early on, as things "get settled" and the uterus gets a bit heavier, they cramp.  One would think it would continue as the baby grows and makes the uterus even heavier, but it doesn't work that way...thank goodness! It will ease up as you approach the end of 1st trimester and may not return at all until Labor Day!  Goooood Luck!!!! :-)|`|98244c63036296284633f8c02d773371aa	It surely is...I'm 5 weeks...and had the sammme exact feelings...they freaked me out, but the doctor told me today as well as every person I know who has had a baby, it's totally normal. It's your uterus expanding to accomodate the baby growing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you!

You uterus is growing and pushing muscles out of it's way.|`|2jiNLOKHaa	i waited 4 days after my period was missed to test because of the cramps. they felt EXACTLY like period cramps and i was sure my period was comming. it just never did.|`|MXXOICquaa	yes its the way your body prepares itself for being pregnant its just because the muscles are stretching|`|RSbbLs5saa	its normal. its your uterus stretching :)|`|ETvV9aypaa	yup normal
CdJtH0xdaa	There's no right way to say it. Just sit them down, and say "Mom, dad, I'm pregnant." They'll probably be shocked, but you should answer all their questions, and try not to get them more angry than they already will be.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	"mom, dad, i'm pregnant"<br>  <br>  simple. to the point. effective.<br>  <br>  you cant really dance around this subject.|`|oGHtaaCkaa	"I'm pregnant."|`|snDAuu27aa	Hey.  I was 14 when I found out I was pregnant.  I just went up to my mom and told her we need to talk.  We sat down at our dinner table and I said, "Mom, You have been a good mom, and I know you've tried your best to raise me, but I'm pregnant."  Email me if you want to know anything else or if you need help with anything.  I'd be glad to help you.|`|g7wQij2Oaa	that's hard. but you just gotta sit 'em down and tell them straight up. it will make things a lot easier once they know. good luck. i hope they are understanding and will be able to help you. i'm 23 and it was hard for me to tell my parents, too, cuz i wasn't married for the first few months. i knew they would be disappointed, cuz that's how parents are supposed to be. but now, it's all excitement!<br>  <br>  :)|`|0d1b5fcc305ead0ef5c939b96424f4b2aa	You just have to suck it up and tell them. Don't beat around the bush or hint around it just say it. And then be prepared to be screamed at, and have the life of the baby's daddy threatened. As well it should be as a 15 year old has no business even having sex much less being pregnant.|`|k3sL7mZtaa	It's easier just to get to the point.<br>  I was 16 when I got pregnant and 17 when my son was born.<br>  There's no easy way to tell them.<br>  <br>  But if I were you, I would wait and tell them when you turned 16. Depending on your state/province law, your parents can force you into having an abortion. I know where i'm from, it's 16.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I wish you all the best!<br>  Don't worry about all the negative comments. You're already better than them by ignoring them.|`|1AnYcrr6aa	Just say it there's really know other way to do it. But if theres absolutly no way you can spit it out you could write a note to your mother, you could also talk to a guidance counseler at school and see if they could assist you in telling your parents. best in luck! you'll probably feel so much better  after you tell them.|`|zevqkFDXaa	You just have to suck it up and tell them.  I was 19 when I got pregnant and telling my parents was the hardest thing ever.  I would just sit them down and tell them.  They will be upset, but you can't go through this alone.  You need your parents.  After they calm down, then you can discuss your plans them.  Just give them some time to process and remind them how much you need their support and love.  I hope this helps, I know how hard it is to be pregnant at a young age.  Good Luck!|`|FvNFkLJ5aa	I was in your shoes about 4 years ago. I wrote my mom a letter, it was really hard but I felt like it was the best way to do it because I couldn't possibly see myself just coming out and saying it. I gave it to her before I left so she had time to soak in the information. She was undoubtedly pissed but she got over it, eventually. Now she is absolutely in love with my son! As for my dad, I asked my mom for her help and she said she would but I think she froze when it came time to, I just up and told him and he got up and walked away, which was honestly harder then hearing my mom scream at me. No matter what you do they will get over it and they will accept your decision. And do what feels right to you, don't let other influence your decision, the answer will come to you.|`|4Yl2awlkaa	It's never easy. But ask them to sit down before you tell them. And make sure you're close by, but not within arms length (if they are prone to being angry).   They will undoubtedly have many questions (who, when/how far along, are you going to keep it? are you going to offer the baby up for adoption?). You may want to have brief answers for these questions they have.|`|1JcMFp3Taa	Open your mouth and say Am pregnant<br>  <br>  DUH!!!!

The fertility rate goes down as you get older just because your body stops producing eggs and gets ready for menopause. But no matter the age, if there is an egg to be fertilized and you have unprotected sex, you can get pregnant.|`|5099ffc117e8dfe6b95f19667ddf615baa	Males produce sperm from puberty until death so you are always able to get a woman pregnant.While an 80 year old man is more likely to have damaged sperm there are millions of sperm in ejaculation and it only takes one so no your sperm is no stronger at 17 than it is at 40.|`|4OUszQ6zaa	no matter what age unprotected sex is dangerous|`|CMQnJhodaa	Please read this link <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.menstruation.com.au/menstrualproducts/getpregnantnaturally.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.menstruation.com.au/menstrual...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps answer your question!!<br>  <br>  I had my first at 17yr, tried and tried to fall again, 8 years later at 25 yr I'm finally pregnant again!! due March 09|`|7yADGE3laa	I know it can be harder at 40 but about the same for 17 and 25. <br>  <br>  The healthiest (prime time) for having a baby is 25.

Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|vKEYa8aeaa	yes they can, as long as they are giving you an u/s, some offices dont do an ultrasound until the 2nd visit or 18 weeks unless there is a history of miscarriage/high risk. i found out i was having a boy at 15 weeks.|`|ApyrV5J9aa	It's not always possible, but if the baby cooperates you can. I had my last ultrasound done at 14 1/2 weeks and we are quite obviously having a boy. No doubt about it. I think its a little more certain if its a boy because if  you think its a girl, there is always a chance that you just couldn't see the penis. If you do see one, its kind of hard to deny it, ya know? But yes, at 16 weeks it is VERY possible to tell what it is. Good luck.|`|CxJFfSeiaa	No, they cant tell for sure, but they can take a real good guess, and I have heard that if you put your mind to it during pregnancy, you and your husband/boyfriend can choose the sex of th baby. I don't know if it is true, but you can try. I did that... I wanted a girl... I had a beautiful baby girl in February. So it could very well be true!|`|c5AJGcYcaa	If you are having an ultrasound, you won't necessarily have one just because you are going to the doctor, there is a chance, but usually they won't 'look' until you are past 18 weeks.

I work with kids who are diagnosed with ADHD and other disorders and believe me, they can learn to function in society and at home without making everyone around them crazy. Sit them down and explain your expectations like; saying what you feel instead of getting physical and asking permission instead of helping yourself to another's things. Encourage them both to use arguments as learning times to put themselves in the other's shoes and examine their own behavior and how they can change the problem into something else.|`|aBWu7tyHaa	Well my situation is slightly different so I don't know if this will help at all but I see a difference in my two so I'll share.  My oldest is only 4 and lil' bro is almost 2.  My younger one has developmental delays.  Doesn't talk, can't hardly communicate, doesn't even walk well without falling over, likes to copy big brother and wants everything he has so they obviously fight a lot b/c older bro doesn't understand that lil bro doesn't communicate and doesn't understand that he is being bothersome to big bro.  What I do is just separate them for certain activities, i give them each special "mommy" time (daddy is army and in A'stan.......AGAIN-so I usually have to do this on my own anyway) and I do special fun activities with them both together as well.  It seems to help them understand each other just that little bit more, and appreciate the times together and separate.  We have strict "talking" rules at our house, when we are angry or upset we talk it out with each other.  We don't yell, and if we get angry we take a time out on our beds by ourselves until we calm down and can talk about the problem.  I know they seem young for things like that but i'm telling you it works and I go with it.  Maybe have older bro help lil' bro with homework and explain to him about the ADHD and how we have to have patience with him.  Try the time out thing when they get angry until they are ready to talk about why they got mad.  We also do hugs and apologies when we fight.  My kids are younger and don't hold grudges for very long though, so that might be a little much for your guys, but I like the talking and time out thing, and like i said i do activities with both of them separate and i do things with them together and i see a major difference in attitudes on a day that we are busy and don't get special time or there's a lot going on and too many things to focus on.  let them take turns picking a show to watch on tv or a book to read or game to play.  and be consistant with it so they learn who's turn it is and accept it.  hope that helped a little.  best of luck
bFP6jfvVaa	That name is absolutely gorgous! I love it. =)|`|wDsw9thcaa	It sounds nice|`|pHIUUnOiaa	OMGG MY NAME IS KAYLA!!!

wjPcDlK7aa	If I had never heard of that name, I would probably say it's not my kind of thing. But, I have a friend called Silvana and she's the most kindest person :) <br>  She's also really smart! So I think of her when I see that name. <br>  <br>  So, I like it =)|`|mZi7R0Enaa	dislike, sorry! This name sounds a name some parents *made up* to keep up with new names!|`|zprAkP3eaa	It's a little weird.|`|fboC1N7gaa	It makes me think of the electronics company Sylvania. I like the names Sylvie, Sylvia and Sylviana better.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	I like it I think it's real cute.|`|zXcaTKqRaa	Saliva comes to mind when i heard that name. i dislike it.|`|DO3grY10aa	I have come to appreciate Silvana.  I like that it has three syllables, and it incorporates the letter "v" that is so popular right now.  <br>  <br>  It's a refreshing alternative to the more common Olivia, Vivian, Ava, Evie, Liv and Evelyn.<br>  <br>  Nice variation on Sylvia I might add, and seel-VAH-na is easy to pronounce for English speakers if that is the pronunciation you are going for.|`|fmdoGQizaa	It instantly reminded me of the name 'Savannah'. I like the name Savannah, and because Silvana is similar to Savannah, I like it too.<br>  Although when I first looked at it I thought it said something like 'Saliva'.|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	Kind of reminds me of nirvana haha.<br>  No, but i like it! Its very unique, i love people with unique names, i was named Mickey like mickey mouse, but after my grandpa. But now and then i spell it Micki instead :]<br>  <br>  I love the name a lot, very unique and pretty!|`|RpK7CoSHaa	It reminds me of Sylvan Learning Center.|`|NePgB9b2aa	I think it's lovely, and the nickname Silvie would be adorable too.|`|YIPIIXHlaa	brings vampires to mind.|`|wDsw9thcaa	Sound like silvia and savanna <br>  It is cute!|`|ZH9OIfUXaa	don't like it. saliva  kinda sounds like an std! :[
1ff989b96b1bf7a1a992cce3e5420457aa	No! Not at all.<br>  <br>  You should double up one day to get back on track and leave it at that. Your period may be a little late (IF THAT), but since you take them consistently, you should not have a problem at all.<br>  <br>  No worries...|`|WFXh3lGnaa	No, probably not, it was only one. So im pretty sure you will be alright :)
a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	You need to ovulate in order to conceive. Some women got pregnant immediately after a period because ovulation occur early for that mth.

vKEYa8aeaa	barbie.com is fun for little girls. im not sure about little boys though|`|tEtYO6PPaa	neopets.com is so much fun for little kids :)|`|LrFiV2W7aa	My brother likes cartoon network (for boys) and my cousin likes disney channel (mostly girls). They are websites that a 4 yr old can use, so they should be able to play on it. The games are cute and most are easy to understand even without reading, but since they are 5-6 they should read the instructions to better their reading comprehension.|`|3fJ8IMRVaa	Bellasarah.com a horse card collection website where you can dress up horses and decorate them , our daughter loves it. She also plays at barbie.com , I think one of the best is Neopets.com its been around a long time and as you get better at the games you can collect more items give things away to the poor and its all safe under your parental control - you get a pet and feed it every day play games to gain points or money and buy your food its almost real life training .. lots of fun for both kids and parents.|`|3Fu1DkvZaa	My children are grown, but my granddaughters are different.<br>  I have these, hopefully they will help you.<br>  lil duck is pretty good from what my eldest says|`|02xxwMRBaa	um. maybe www.fisher-price.com/us/fun/games<br>  <br>  but you can always go to crayola.com and get some arts and craft ideas for you and the kids
7imMv3Niaa	you are bound to see the precursors to the scenario. calm him before he screams distract him play with him what ever works. don't let him get to the scream stage.|`|g2JiDPnmaa	Make sure that you reward his good behavior with encouraging words and maybe a small star or some kind of motivation to behave.  Praise, praise and praise until he craves positive attention and not negative attention.  Maybe his mom could make sure she says "goodnight" to him as well before she goes off to bed to assure him that she will be back after her nap.  Good luck!

cIn8BkYHaa	at about 3 weeks pregnant I was about the sickest I've been in my life, I couldn't breathe or swallow. It could possibly be due to conception what you are experiencing or simply the change in season and weather can really trigger colds as well. About ten days after getting sick I got my positive. So good luck to you. (the being sick sucks, but I have not been sick since!) :)|`|CxJFfSeiaa	I had a really bad cold when i was pregnant, but i was only about half way through the pregnancy. It isn't fun, but i am sure you are ok!|`|i6mydMOyaa	Wow,  have never heard of that before, but when I think back, at the very beginning of BOTH of my pregnancies (before I had a positive test) I had a terrible head cold/sinus infection!  Crazy!
UcWA30y9aa	WOW - only once a day is really SAD!! The poor baby has to sit in a wet and/or dirty diaper all day :(  Awwww<br>  <br>  I think she should be changing the diaper at least 7 times a day.  Once in the morning straight after waking up, between breakfast and lunch, after lunch before a nap, after nap, after dinner, and then again in the evening and right before bed.  If the baby is dirty then change the baby when required!!!  If the baby is wet the baby NEEDS to be changed!!|`|AA11520456	i change my baby's diaper 3 to 4 times daily...|`|n6XYYyoLaa	every time it is wet or poopy; whether it's a little or a lot, if it is dirty, it has to go...i check her every hour or two and feel for the gel when i pick her up, so i stay pretty much on top of the dirty diapers...she's nine mos now, so they aren't as often, but sometimes when she goes it is a lot at once....i can't imagine she is reallly doing that and her baby hasn't already come up on the radar at the doc's office bc of the condition of his bum....|`|h59Bc4wfaa	When my son was 3 months old I changed him at every feeding. A habit I got from him being in the NICU. <br>  <br>  Now he's 15 months old and I have to chase him to change even a poopy diaper! <br>  <br>  I go through a bag of size 3 diapers in about a week.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I change them whenever they are wet or poopy.  First thing in the morning, before nap, after nap, after dinner, and before bed are the times I change him regardless other than that I just check them throughout the day.  My son has very sensitive skin so if he is in a wet diaper longer than a few minutes after peeing, he develops a bad rash.|`|p6AMoTs8aa	I change her diaper about 4-6 times a day now that she is 10 months she doesnt need a diaper change that often|`|rFtKFp03aa	6 times a day.. <br>  <br>  we changed more when they were smaller.. <br>  <br>  we have triplets.. that is 18 diapers a day.. <br>  <br>  I care about my babes .. not saving a buck.. <br>  <br>  I would report them.. that is child neglect..|`|MeYILJeSaa	Oh my lord. That's disgusting. There's no way I would be able to leave my three month old in a diaper all day. <br>  First of all, he would yell at me.<br>  Second of all, he would get his poo all over everything.<br>  Third of all, I don't want to deal with a fussy baby with a rash.<br>  I dunno, I guess it's worth it to me to spend the money on diapers. Sounds like a great mom!<br>  To answer your question, I change my son's diaper (on average) about 6-7 times a day. More if he's pooping more, and sometimes he goes a few days without pooping. So it depends.<br>  Oh, and she's an idiot. Bulk is not more expensive if you divide the price down to the cost of each diaper.|`|d6Uncd6iaa	Oh no that is terrible. I change my 18 month old about 7 or 8 times a day. As far as diapers being expensive, i buy a case of 100 at wal-mart for just over $14 It is parents choice brand (Genaric Wal-mart brand) They are soft and durable. I'd tell her to try that instead of changing the poor baby once a day. Not only can he/she get rashes, but infections! I wish you and your brother all the luck in the world, and I hope everything works out.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	That is disgusting. When she is wet or poopy. I don't know how many times really. I don't limit it. A huge box of Huggies is $20 at Walmart. Sadly my niece's mom sounds like her, so I know what you are going through. If she would stop buying A & W and energy drinks she could buy diapers!|`|2qntbDGKaa	man poor baby! your brother totally should get custody! what i dumb ***! but on my 3 kids a had a system of changing when they got up, after they ate, after nap, and before bed, and of course whenever they poop or when they needed it!|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	when she was 3 months it was every 2 hours, or before I fed her, now she is 10 months prob every 2-4 hours, I use swaddlers and it gets squishy if she wets, then I change her. so Prob 4-6 times a day|`|xizOziYSaa	Once a day is nottttt good? What in the hell is wrong with people now days turn her into CPS. I change my babys diaper EVERY time its wet or dirty.|`|0oHakDnKaa	I have a four month old, and I change him 6 - 8 times a day at least.  That is just cruel how would she like to sit in wet or poopy pants all day.|`|kg18TbsGaa	i have a 1 month old and she uses about 12 diapers! if she wants to save money she should use cloth diapers.. how would she like it if someone left her sitting in poop all day! selfish..|`|lmk3mKJgaa	Umm I get the big box of diapers and in a good week that may last for about a week and a half but they have lasted me as little as 5 days and i get 120 in the box. and thats now when my daughter is almost 2 yrs old so when she was 3 months old i was changing her about every two hours maybe 3 but sometimes 5 minutes after i got the clean one on her i would be changing her again. you are right your nephew is suffering because of this. and idk what brand of diapers she buys but with luvs you can get a lil pack with like 40 some diapers for like 10 bucks and then the big pack with 80 some for like 15 bucks and then the box with 120 (this is for size 3) for 20 bucks how is that too expensive
MigBOiUPaa	does he want u tell her? if not do not get involved!<br>  <br>  but if he doesnt care then just ask her be like hey would u ever go out w/ douglas? and see wut she says and if she asks u why u asked then just be like oh no reason i just thought yall would make a cute couple =]|`|drI1vsJdaa	Ask her how she feels about him|`|DhZ5smpWaa	I agree with mr pickle, you should keep your nose out of this. It's up to him, if he does really like her, he'd go and risk everything to tell her. Really, it isn't your place to do anything, even with good intentions.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	I would keep your nose out of this.
ksWm9eCBaa	Because they're too stupid to find the words they really need to say to express their anger at whatever this conflict is...so they're hitting below the belt.  Hopefully, you've distanced yourself from these creeps, but if you're hit like that again in the future...muster up a smile, be sweet and calmly say, "I hope she's perfectly healthy...not perfect, because no one is--you certainly aren't...and one day, I'll take her to the zoo.  We'll visit the Reptiles...I'll show her the snakes...and I'll remember YOU, as I say 'look Honey---see how slimey and cold they are?  Watch closely:  you'll see a nasty tongue dart in and out!  Some people can be like that, too...but that's okay, cause we'll stay away from them!' Then...we'll go get an ice cream...and I'll never think of you again!"  and...walk away, hang up, whatev!!!  In the meantime, enjoy your pregnancy, consider the source and know that you've gotten a long-distance hug from Eema!!!!|`|tMeN2fm0aa	People are horrible!! Im not sure why someone would say something so wrong, but I hope that these immature people are not people that you continually choose to surround yourself with.  You should TRY to avoid people like this as much as possible.  Just know that your angel is going to be great, and that Karma is a biatcha!  They will get theirs!  Congrads on your baby, and Im sorry this happens to you!|`|T9fek24eaa	What kind of people are you talking to? I think it takes a low life person to wish such a thing upon an innocent baby. I dont believe in karma, but I do think god is listening to things like that and that people that say things like that will always get theirs too... Don't let them get to you.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	They just figure that the best way to get you upset right now!! You must be a pretty strong person if they had to sank that low to feel like they were hurting you!! A-holes!!

Move on and surround yourself with supportive people!|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	You must be around some very immature people.<br>  <br>  No adult in their right mind would wish ill health upon an innocent child.<br>  <br>  As people have said, there are some very cruel, sick people out there.|`|duinadV4aa	they know by saying something like that will hurt you more then anything just pray over your baby
kM3t3iDsaa	I agree with the whole thing.<br>  <br>  If a foetus is aborted, why can't the cells be used to save the life of someone. I don't care for religion and other things, until you look into the eyes of someone you know will benefit from those cells, you have no idea.<br>  <br>  Come the day it happens to your family, you really can't say.<br>  I know I would do whatever I could to help my Boys.|`|T9fek24eaa	I think stem cells could be something that dreams are made out of, but we are never going to know until we research it. Already stem cells have proved to help in cancer, brain injury, cerebral palsy, birth defects, spinal cord injuries... and that is just to name a few. I have a friend who's son had Leukemia when he was 4 months old and cord blood (which contains stem cells) saved his life. I dont know how any one can look at that little boy and say that it is wrong. <br>  <br>   As far as the argument of embryonic stem cells... unfortunately abortion will always be legal, we will never see the outlawing of it (and I AM pro-choice) in our life times or our childrens life times, so the possibility is always going to be there, we may as well use it to help benefit other man kind.<br>  <br>  Edit- I have to throw out this food for thought for some people... if your child was battling cancer and stems cells were what was going to be the deciding factor in if he lived or died BUT they were embryonic stem cells, would you decline it?|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I support stem cell research but with some reservations.  <br>  <br>  I sincerely hope that science will find another way to obtain effective stem cells without using embryos.  I think the ethical storm that surrounds this is very divisive to this country.  <br>  <br>  My gut instinct is that using embyos is a bit ghoulish, but I can't deny the advances that can happen.  I just hope we find another way.|`|x647LeB2aa	My son had a stem cell transplant from cord blood and the cord blood was collected from his two younger siblings when they were born.<br>  <br>  As the cord has always been a 'throw away' after a baby is born then to find use for it to save lives is fantastic.<br>  <br>  I feel a little less comfortable with cells being taken after abortion but as I know little of the subject I would not be prepared to comment unless I read more on the subject.|`|436fREgIaa	crappy idea i think.god,nature..there isnt a thing as such a destiny or Natural process anymore..and i LOVE how our economy is slipping into the pooper,and our valuable tax dollars go towards this crap.if only they got rid if it,and put our tax dollars to the economy..then maybe this world might get better..a few trillion bucks better! gotta love the president for throwing money us tax payers pay in..right out the dang window..brainiac!|`|BRT2teSqaa	For it.  They aren't killing fetuses solely for this purpose, so I don't understand how someone can be against it.  We're talking possible cures, and definitely better treatments for Parkinsons, paralysis, cancer, the list goes on.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I am very pro life but with this i agree, With all the great things that can come with it I think its an amazing thing. I do understand why bush did what he did but I dont think that the government should censure science like that.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	1000 % for it|`|jtnS02Vxaa	I was going to donate my son's cord blood, but it was to late to do so. I plan on banking the next child's (if we have another one) I'm against using embryo's stem cells but I'm totally for using donated stem cells from live births. Such as the cord blood.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I''m so for it. There have been some amazing advances in the uses of stem cells to treat conditions that even a couple years ago were irreversibly, or fixable, or incurable.<br>  <br>  I saved my daughter's cord blood because I knew then how much it was really worth if something ever happened to her. Using your own is just like a transfusion, it's using donor cells, that has a lot of risk involved, like a transplant.<br>  <br>  I think that the using of aborted fetuses is a way of giving back, that the baby's death wasn't completely for nothing. Sounds harsh, but this is something that will go on forever (abortions) might as well get something good out of it.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	even if they did use aborted babies Im for it!  Why shouldnt the dead help the living? The parent obviously would have to agree to the donation but hey ..they aborted Im sure it woud be extra karma points to give back a little|`|2Hot9EJiaa	ARMY WIFE- I must make a comment on your answer first-  you are right that they don't need to use embryonic (fetus) cells anymore. But our new Pres. just stated that he is removing the ban on embryonic stem cell research, so obvious he thinks it is ok.  I think it is perfectly ok if done on adult stem cells.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	For it.<br>  <br>  My father-in-law suffers terribly from Parkinson's---and that's one of the areas where the stem cells show real promise.<br>  <br>  It breaks my heart to think of all the lives that COULD have been saved, or bettered if they had not banned the research for so long.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	FOR it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, a little FYI for people, they are embryonic stem cells, not fetal stem cells.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	im for it. especially since they no longer need a fetus to get stem cells.

I saw my OB yesterday because I felt a bulging mass at the opening of my vagina that would recede with gentle pressure. I was diagnosed with a uterine prolapse and was told that over the next 5 weeks it should resolve as my growing uterus gets larger and is unable to fit so low in my pelvis. I was instructed to (using either gloves or very clean fingers) gently push my uterus back up into place (as best as possible) each time I felt that it was low in my vagina or protuding. Since my cervix did not show any sings of irritation and I am willing to manipulate myself as necessary, my OB opted to avoid a pessary at this point. I have also been told to rest and stay off my feet as much as possible. Here are my biggest concerns.....how harmful is it for me to puch my own uterus back into place several times a day? Is there great risk of penetrating my cervix and introducing organisms if I am not careful when putting things back into place? Am I doomed to have UP problems from now on or is it possible that this is a pregnancy (hormone, weight of uterus) related problem? Is the fact that I have a retroverted uterus always going to make my risk higher for UP with future pregnancies? Is there any chance that my uterus will not raise back to its proper position even if it gets larger?<br>  <br>  Any information will be greatly appreciated.|`|5d1uZn1Yaa	Did you notice a mucus plug fall out?

The amniotic fluid is there to protect the baby from the stress of labour as well.|`|5h8bYsKdaa	first time the dr had to break it<br>  second time, i just woke up and stepped out of bed gushhhhh<br>  third time, i was on the delivery table and i had to push and they told me not to gushhhhhhhhh<br>  4th time, i was sitting down on the couch with bad contractions and i got up for a  glass of water, slow leak all over!<br>  <br>  wow thats alot to remember :)|`|FLXQ56DMaa	I leaned forward to get something off the coffee table felt a sort of pop(well kinda) and it was like a trickle that kept on...called the hospital after a few min..cause well I wasn't sure and they said come in to make sure but that it was prolly the water breaking and they were right.|`|KYdg8tpUaa	it didnt break until about 40 min before i delivered..so i was at the hospital in the bed..lol..|`|YF8Qe714aa	Yes!  I just woke up and water just came gushing out. What a mess!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Taking a bath. It broke at 9pm the day of my 38wk appointment. I was taking a bath to relieve my swollen feet and when I stood up I noticed that the water just kept dripping. I waddled over to the toilet where my plug came out. My son was born 30hrs later.
AA10953561	Make sure you're getting plenty of high energy foods (proteins, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products). These will help with the lack of energy and your fatigue (which both contribute to your emotional rollercoaster). <br>  <br>  Go out for a walk, this may seem a backwards idea when you're feeling so tired, but it'll help keep your endorphins up which actually helps keep you happy. Whenever you're feeling especially irritable try taking a warm bath, or just getting away from other people and reading a book for a little while.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon! It does get better...eventually!|`|F3dWvVy5aa	hmm I am 7 months also, yay! I would suggest eating tho your appetite has decreased keep your energy up and maybe rest more so you could get an emotional handle on things better. I am just freaking out because I am soo huge and I'm worried about that so it makes me more irritable/unstable feeling.I know with more rest I would be able to rationalize better.|`|m5eIr6ASaa	I went through major emotional highs and lows with my first and second pregnancies, What I found helped was writing in a journal it helped me collect my thoughts, plus its pretty funny and heart warming when you look back at it a few years later.  I'm currently preggers with #3 and I've been alot more laid back, so far.  Good Luck Hang in there it will be over before you know it.
ZVruZGizaa	Aww,lm sorry, l lost my first baby too "Stillborn". Good Luck to you both|`|7ae77e44cab9e4faf755c8a1c3522e05aa	i think that no mum should go though with giving birth to their baby as stillborn, i feel very much for them. :'-(|`|5kYIteIHaa	awww|`|EWFtQNSdaa	My mum had her second baby as a "stillborn"
gMLm3NVBaa	I would handle it like this.. I would tell him If he's not responsible enough to listen to his parents request that he not run off, then he isn't responsible enough to play outside without supervision. That's the way you should explain it to him and then tell him that since he can't be responsible, he will have to get used to his mom or his dad sitting with him and his friends outside nagging them about what they should and shouldn't be playing with or on. One or two days of parental supervision, just might make him realize he doesn't want mommy or daddy around and pick up a little gumption to be a little better listener. I know it would make me do anything so no one had to accompany me and my friends, especially at 11! Hope I helped!|`|aWa5yBeUaa	my advice ENFORCE IT AS LONG AS IT TAKES!!!! sometimes little boys don't quite get it the first time around so maybe a little longer sentence is necessary. 2 weeks maybe? 3? u as the parent has to be the 1 to show him u mean business. tough love doesn't mean u turn into the wicked witch of the west, it means u  love him and need to know he's in a safe place at all times|`|JqxOX1u7aa	Well I am 14 and had been doing the same thing, my mom took my xbox away for a month and i never have done it again, that was 1 year ago, it sucked, does he have videogames, tv or anything he really like in his room or available? Just take it away from him. Simple, hope I helped!|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	Well when hes grounded does  he still get to play with all his toys?  He will learn eventually... Also 11 may be to young to be unsupervised outside... especially since he dosent listen.|`|8lboONb2aa	Beat his *** sh*t. What happened to good ole negative reinforcing spankings? I sure learned a lot from getting smacked...best part of my childhood.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I watch the wandering one..the others listen ..but space cadet kids wander off like alzhiemer patients|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Tell him no more outside, he will change his attitude eventualy, tell him if he dose it agian then he will not be allowed out of the house for a month, and his punishment will be worse and longer each time he dose it|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Well, if he won't listen maybe keeping him from going out is what you need to do to enforce this since nothing else is working.<br>  <br>  If he sees his friends out playing and he is not allowed to join because he takes off without asking, he will learn his lesson.<br>  <br>  Remind him that it isn't difficult to run into the house to let you guys know his plans.Perhaps you can buy him a walkie talkie set to keep in touch.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I would ground him, he is 11 he understand that you mean what you say and you say what you mean. He just doesnt want to listen. So I would figure ok then if he isnt old enough to tell us where he is going then he isnt old enough to go and play with his friends. Keep that up for a while and I bet he will start to tell you where he is going.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	If your son has a cell phone, tell him that you will periodically call him.<br>  You expect him to answer...or return the call within five minutes.<br>  If he fails to do so, he loses a week of freedom. <br>  <br>  (If he doesn't have one, the prepaid types like Net 10 are inexpensive, and have great reception.)<br>  <br>  But you have to be willing to make it stick, if he messes up.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	If he doesn't listen,his friends won't be allowed over for a week..or longer if you wish. And he can go outside,but not to play,he has to help with the yard work..

PNPg9Ytkaa	I had this exact same problem... I talked to my OB and she said that she personally uses an IUD and she suggests it to me because you don't have to worry about taking a pill everyday and it doesn't affect your milk supply (something I was really worried about) I am getting it in 2 weeks and I'm really excited... I'm not fond of the pill and I HATE condoms... talk to your OB and do research but for me the IUD seems best.. it lasts up to 5 years and I don't have to worry about any other BC for that long either!!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Use condoms and track your cycle if you have one. I had the same fear, sometimes still do. I felt much better after getting my regular period back around 8 months. <br>  <br>  Even though pulling out isn't a reliable method alone it's more effective than nothing at all so paired with condoms it's a fairly effective birth control method. Do both pull out and condoms each and every time you have sex.<br>  <br>  I also didn't want to mess with pills while breastfeeding, not that the mini pill is reliable anyway.|`|rFtKFp03aa	Tell your husband/ask your husband to wear a condom.. then you can have all the sex you want.. <br>  <br>  I know not the favored solution, but when they want it.. condoms don't sound so bad after all lol <br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	Just be patient, My hubby and I went through this after I had my baby, I was exhausted and was on progesterone only BC and you have to take them literally at the exact time everyday and I would forget. I was to freaked out about getting preggo again. I just tried to be as "helpful" as possible. I then got an IUD and TMI, but bled for 5 months til I had it removed. Sex was not happening. I just tried to show him as much as I could that I did love and appreciate him and was still attracted to him. Once I had the IUD removed and got the nuvaring. Life is fabulous again. just communicate with him, and be patient. its only been 3 months, you have your whole lives to love each other.|`|AA12190953	Get an iud. There r no chemicals, that get absorbed by your body, you don't have to remember to take a pill or anything and it lasts from 3-10 yrs. And if you decide to have children in the meantime u can have it removed and potentially get pregnant the same day.<br>  Look into it online or ask your Dr about it. It cast a bit more up front but totally worth not having to worry about all the crap that comes with normal bc.and being able to be spontaneous is great. Its 99.9% effective.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Tell him to wear a condom or get him to have a vesectomy, they can always be reversed.|`|2qntbDGKaa	ok so first off it's a normal thing for you to go though that stage where you don't want to have sex or your afraid to get pregnant again. i would say tell your hubby how you feel and ask him to wear a condom... you know i have 3 kids and i don't like birth control pills either so i got the 10yr IUD i've had it for 4yrs now and love it, you can have sex anytime and not have to worry about it, my hubby loves it too since he doesn't have to wear a condom.|`|L3CXT6Muaa	i have an IUD, and its great, if i had the pill i know i would forget to take it, and who wants to worry about condoms, the IUD that i have is called "paragaurd" it is hormone free (so your breast milk will have to hormones in it) and it last for at lest 10 years, and medicaid paid for it|`|Tapm6oF7aa	I'm in the same boat as you.

It's a phase in life that you are going through, and your feelings are important.Don't do anything you don't feel comftorable with.|`|h3Ed9qm9aa	My GP gave me minipill which did not affect my milk supply at all, and now I have IUD.
cnK4X2sZaa	sticky situation on your hands but i say just call him... no its not fair to your boyfriend...b/c if you put yourself in his shoes im sure you would see that. but it just really depends on your personal situation. to me high school relationships are taken to seriously... later in life you'll realize this. but to be honest i really dont think your ex sounds like someone you should have in your life....i know you probably feel the need to help him. maybe your even attracted to the bad guy in him. that also gets old... i know how you feel though. i was kinda that way when i was younger.... but honestly its not worth the worry and stress. cause think about it. is he thinking about you? and how it affects you when your worrying about him? and trying to reach him and he doesn't even have the common decency to answer you?  if you put it into perspective its pretty simple. focus on your man not on your ex... ex's are ex's for a reason. and this one sounds like he has some issues. and as much as you think you can help him, trust you me...you cant.  i learned that many times in my life. i hope i could help you with my answer... take care of you first.... and then your relationship that your in.<br>  take care best of luck.|`|eO1zN6wSaa	jus dont worry about him<br>  worry about some new dudes.<br>  <br>  help with my question ladies only <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqJMc2VuPRHa88CyhKPq1QHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309210326AAWmc6m">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	Stop feeling like you need to take care of your ex.  You can't fix what was wrong before and you can't fix it now.  You can't fix the world of people that need help and it doesn't matter how well you know them.<br>  If you're so worried about this ex-boyfriend and you can't get a response from a text message then why didn't you call his parents, a sibling or a friend to make sure he was okay?  You love the part of his need in you when he used and you (I'm guessing) have a partner that's not a user of drugs and he's just not making or letting you know how much he needs you on a day to day basis.<br>  Let go of the past and go forward with the new which is probably better.  Know where you were, know where you've been and know where you want to be and who you are.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I had a little of the same experience with an Ex. An ex was on drugs so i broke up with him and approached the matter as a Friend Friend situation, anyway whilst i was still helping him out i became interested in another guy, but my time was fully devoted to trying to help my Ex quit his drug habit.<br>  In the end i manage to get him to quit, but refused to start dating the other guy until 6months later to ensure that my Ex had settled down a little and gotten over me enough to let the 'love' go. But he didnt and fully went on a crazy rampaige. Wouldnt talk to anyone, would go off his head at me, his parents everyone and everything he came across he'd go off at. He'd pack his **** and go away for a few days and no one could get into contact with him. I panicked and would almost ignore my boyfriend to try and get into contact with my Ex. My ex wouldnt answer my calls, wouldnt answer my texts. So in the end i thought "stuff it, im not going to waste my time on you after everything ive done for you, you go and do this". So i didnt even bother trying to contact him for a week - during that week i was almost non-stop thinking about him for his safety, whether he went back to his drug taking. I felt bad because i was too worried to even pay attention to my own boyfriend. Than i got a text msg from my ex saying "Well thanks for your concern. Just leave me hanging for a week with no contact" and i was like "Arh, excuse me! I tried day in and day out to get into contact with you but you f*cked around with me and didnt even try to let me know you were ok" than he smirks and says "No news is good news isnt it?" I felt like smacking him down so bad! But after that he went back to being the happy go lucky guy he was before his drugs and no more crazy rampaiges come from him!<br>  <br>  But in the end the "No communication" approach worked6 They take advantage of the fact you are so worried. They're males, they try and deal with things in their own minds their own ways. Sometimes those ways work and sometimes they dont. If you end your communication it makes them think "Oh.. no one cares" than they finally wake upto themselves and think "Well, i better see whats going on"<br>  <br>  They play mind games with you - you play mind games back.|`|EccBqsntaa	Have you ever thought that he is in trouble with his parents or some type of authority?<br>  <br>  Don't bug him. Yeah. Its not fair to your current boyfriend.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	I've had...well, not so VERY similar situations, but similar enough to understand how you feel.<br>  If you can't get in touch with him, it's because he doesn't want to be found. He could be embarrassed that he got explelled, or he could be trying to start a new life, and for a lot of teens that means leaving EVERYTHING about the old one behind. Send him one last text, and write him one last letter (he might have gotten his phone taken away - his address will be in the phone book) and explain that while you valued what you had and will always care for him, it's emotionally draining for you to worry about him. Wish him the best, and tell him goodbye.<br>  I know it's hard, but this is one of the rare times in life where you have to cut your losses, bury your dead, and move on. You probably liked him for who he was, and you probably like the IDEA of him now, as some recluse or tragic hero. Let it go, and try to see what IS. This kind of worrying isn't healthy for you, and it will eat your life away. You have to let it go.<br>  Don't choose the past and might-have-beens and could-maybe-bes over what is. Be thankful for who and what you have.
c8feax6gaa	* If they put their child up for adoption they should realize that it was a decision they made to better the child because of whatever reason; They should realize that its not fair to the other couple who raised the child as their own and how would they like it if sombody did that to them.<br>  * Dead beat dads shouldn't be around at all if they abandon their child, I think that they if you abandon your child theres not much worse you can do to them. However if a dad is unfit to be a parent and goes off somwhere to become a better person for that child like a rehab place or to get other kind of help I think that they should be allowed back into thier childs life after they recieved the help that they needed.<br>  * Personally I have never known or met my biological father..

I understand that "blood" tie and wanting to make it work, but it can't always be.  Sometimes the safest and healtiest thing for everyone is just to move on.  Also, what affect will these negative people have on grandchildren etc as the "child" starts a family themselves.

The mother gave her child up for adoption, but never told the father. He was incarcerated. She lied on the forms, claiming not to know who the father was, to get around needing consent. Then she got back together with him, and wanted the baby back...after FOUR years.  I watched footage of them literally tearing that child from the only parents she had ever known---to give her back to her "natural" parents.<br>  <br>  It left a deep impression.<br>  <br>  In this day and age, a woman can decide between a closed, and open adoption. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I believe that should be honored. This also means they are bound to stay away, if they choose a closed adoption. Being adopted seems like a a mixed emotional bag as it is...without having someone show up suddenly and upsetting the apple cart.  The adoptive parents have rights as well...and ignoring that is just wrong.|`|125baa5bf060d0a198bc94914f749bacaa	This should be up to the child I think. Sure the parent can offer to open up communication if they have been out of the picture for awhile, but in the long run, you can't force a relationship on anyone. The child is the important one. Reproducing and then skipping out, being shouldered out or taking time out can certainly affect how that kid feels about you as a parent. Some kids are more forgiving than others. It's a very individual and personal thing and I don't think anyone who is not involved can make any judgment calls or suggestions - unless the parent is dangerous in some way - then the child needs to be protected.|`|AA12020110	IF a parent gives up rights to the child, it is a done deal.  <br>   But there are many many cases where when a mother is too sick to care for a new baby that baby will be raised by another member of the family, or in some cases, a neighbor.  Sometimes the child just stays with the people who raise them, but visit their biological parents and siblings.  Everything is out in the open, no secrets.  I think your 'parents are the people who actually Raise you, rather than just the people who contributed egg and sperm. <br>  <br>  I think an older child should be able to at least meet their biological parent at least once.  But a parent who 'opted' out of their responsibility at 16 might really have had change of heart in the intervening years.  A parent who is in their twenties and abandons a family is a whole other story.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Well, I'm going to speak as an adoptive parent here.<br>  <br>  Many domestic adoptions in the US are considered "open", meaning there is some level of communication between the first family and the adoptive family.  This can include: letters, pictures or even visits and ongoing contact and communication.  In most states, open adoptions are not legally enforceable, so there is technically nothing to prevent potential adoptive parents from making all sorts of promises they do not intend to keep.<br>  <br>  I believe that adoptive parents have a moral (and should have a legal) obligation to keep to the open adoption agreement (excluding situations where there is a danger to the child). <br>  <br>  In order for an open adoption to work, there needs to be a clear understanding of boundaries.  Which means that the adoptive parents keep their promises... and the first family understands that the primary parental authority resides with the adoptive family.<br>  <br>  Adoptive parents are not babysitters.  Adoptive parents aren't the "temporary fix" in case the biological parents decide, years down the road, that they want to be parents.  A lack of stability and permanency for a child is not good for him/her.  <br>  <br>  I completely support open adoption and believe that if the boundaries are understood and both parties are comfortable with the agreement, it works out very well for the child<br>  <br>  ETA: Those situations happen very rarely.  Once an adoption is finalized, the only way it can be overturned is if the first family can prove coerscion.  Or, in some cases, the father was not informed of the adoption and can challenge for custody.  It's very rare that someone just shows up 8 years later and demands their child back.|`|f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	Maybe not in the most extreme circumstances.  Like when there is a very bad case of child abuse or drugs.  I know kids from situations like that and it's very sad for both sides because often the parents were abused or raised by drugged out parents so that's all they know.<br>  <br>  However, you talk about 'deadbeat' dads, but don't mention anything about women.  What about 'deadbeat' mothers, like that Octomom who pop out kid after kid that they know they can't afford and are destined to be neglected by the mother and raised in poverty?
L3CXT6Muaa	you should bring your baby's baby book, if you have one, they put your baby footprints in the book , not just give it to you on  paper, after you have the baby you might want more pillows to sleep on other then theirs. when you brings cloths to leave the hospital make them bigger size clothes, you will want to be comfy. and make sure you bring the man that got you pregnant, because you will need help getting up and going to the bathroom after you have the baby (i was going to the bathroom and fainted on the floor!) the nurse was their to help me get up though, (my boyfriend was asleep-lol)|`|532XA7lkaa	Carmex, comfy slippers for my feet during birth, nice, soft  fluffy bathrobe, my pillow from home.|`|gWiZAsfBaa	A secret stash of junk food.

drI1vsJdaa	You don't smack siblings butts. it's mean, and you are not the one to discipline her. I would've smacked you too.<br>  <br>  EDIT:It's a private part, and you're not supposed to touch it.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Seeing as how you seem to be a boy, you should know better than to hit a girl - you might have hit her harder than you intended. The butt is obviously also a somewhat sexualised place. That being said, she shouldn't have hit you, either.<br>  I think you both need to grow up and agree not to touch each other unless it's in a loving manner.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Well if sisters are being brats the last thing you want to do is touch us! Makes us twice as agro! I know you were joking but sometimes we just don't find it to be funny when we are on rampaiges! I'm not saying you should hit your sister let alone anyone at all but hit her on the leg near the calf - goes down a lot better than the butt! Not as 'sexual'|`|EgoT5xkkaa	It is not the problem of where you hit.<br>  If you hit her somewhere else ,then also she may react like this.<br>  My sister was like that .So i used to take care of not fighting with her.If i give her one,she will give me two.|`|5uUSJNSLaa	lol, your sis is too sensitive. i mean, u guys are siblings. u should have seen the unidentical twins in my class. theyr so close that they pinch each others bum sometimes. and wow, the girl twin even hop onto the guy twin's shoulders and they were like mucking around.<br>  when i didnt know they were twins at first, i was like 'wtf theyr sick!!' and lol, i was guilty when i found out they were twins. but still, they scare me a bit sometimes.<br>  <br>  your sis is just overreacting.|`|d7kGopYxaa	You should know better then to slap a girl, even if its on her tush! I would feel so violated. You didn't deserve the slaps but you shouldn't have overstepped her boundaries.|`|yIRcd5X8aa	siblingness; thats what's wrong with her|`|kRaVa0Wraa	because if you hadnt been her brother that could be considered sexual harassment.|`|ajDohnPIaa	Well girls are sensitive about guys hitting them in certain places. Even a close family member. She might have been confused on why you hit her there. And it was probably an instant thought to slap you. I have done that plenty of times not even noticing what I was doing. Just calm down. And let it pass =]
98qMZZPlaa	Oh yes!!  It goes by way too fast.  And, I know i am done, so i Try to cherish everything my youngest does.  Wayyyy to quick, they grow up. <br>  <br>  But honestly, i wont miss the being up all night (although i  hear your always up all night through the teen yrs anyway) and the *****y diapers.|`|T9fek24eaa	I miss it in some ways, but then there are other ways that I am so happy she is not a baby. I definitely miss holding her all the time and her letting me cuddle her. I dont miss the diapers, the numerous middle of the night feedings, teething, and things like that. Now I just see her becoming her own little person more and more each day and it makes me sad and a so proud at the same time! Parenting is bitter sweet!|`|iLLoc003aa	Thanks for asking this question! I have a 4yr old son and a 2yr old daughter. My son will be 5 in July and starting kindergarten in the fall and seeing him get so big makes us sad. I am usually the one saying I want another baby but ever since I went and registered my son for kindergarten my husband has been telling me how sad he is and that it would be nice to have another boy :) I tell him we don't have babies anymore and he well we still have our princess but I said no we don't! That princess this morning threw her feet in my face this morning demanding that I paint her toe nails and then the other day at the mall she literally dragged me into Claire's to buy necklaces and bracelets and told me she wants to go to the place where you get your finger nails and toe nails painted! The kid is 2 and asking for mani/pedi's! I don't have a baby! I have a 2yr old that think's she is 16!|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I have my moments that I do but then again I like being able to talk to her and her being able to carry on a really long drawn out conversation with her, once you get her started she wont stop talking.|`|LJDiSCCNaa	It's an even cooler time when they become more of a person that you can conversate with than a jiggly ball of cries and poop.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	Yes, I miss it but I love seeing them grow and learn more and more everyday.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I am a little bit but watching her learn and grow each day is amazing too.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	the amazing Vee..werent you on maury povich? (my 13 yr old dresses like a hooker?)|`|ajDohnPIaa	Well ofcourse we miss them being little. We don't USUALLY take the time to notice how precious it is. BUT when parent's think too long about when their little ones were even smaller, that's when they think about having another one. But then you remember all the not so precious moments =]. We will all miss how our kids looked when they were first born..Or their first word, even first smile. I remember my baby's first smile..And the first time i seen her demples. they were about a cenimeter long. =]. But just wait till they are about 18!! AHH|`|rhPCJfeuaa	When I see a baby, I feel that burning need to have another one.  But, when it comes to my 5 yr old and 2 yr old, I'm too wrapped up in the wonder of watching them grow and develop into these wonderful people to miss them as babies.  I do like to look at their baby clothes and old pictures, but I am completely in love with them at their current age.  Each new word or expression is amazing.  Wanting to try everything and soak everything up.  I'm too busy living in the moment with them to keep looking back.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Yes, there are days when I miss when they were babies...but when they get older and start to become more independent, sometimes I don't miss those days so much! LOL They do get big too fast though!<br>  <br>  LOL.. great now i can go to sleep with the opening to that song in my head! I'll probally have the video playing in my dreams! Remember the part where the hand goes through the comic book..and the end of it where the guy is like beating on the walls and throwing himself around..yeeah.. thanks! LOLLL|`|ntdGOZqGaa	In a way, but I also find it awsome that my son is growing and learning things everyday. Every single day my son will say something or someting and I'm like where did he learn that from lol. So its also nice.|`|1S5AbPueaa	My sons are 3 and 18 months and while there are times I miss them being babies...I know i will miss my sleep more if they were to be babies again.So keep growing so mommy can catch up on her sleep deficit.
kRaVa0Wraa	you're an adult now.<br>  go looking for an apartment.<br>  once you find one, sit your mom down and tell her that youre too old to live by her rules anymore, and that youre moving out if she likes it or not.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	If you're ready to move out and support yourself, and you're willing to do that - you're willing to pay for a place to live, and food, and insurance, and school, and you can do that without her - then go. You are an adult. If you don't need her money, you don't need her permission, and it sounds like she isn't going to face the fact that you're grown up until you make her. Get a car if you can, learn the public transportation system if you can't, find your apartment, and let her know you're moving out AFTER you've removed all your important belongings from the house. <br>  <br>  She might be mad at first. She might not talk to you for a bit. But, as she's your mom, hopefully she'll come around, and this shattering of the parent-child relationship can lead to a healthy adult-to-adult relationship later on.|`|vR4k5iVCaa	well as long as you live under her roof. you do have to follow her rules even if they make you feel like a child. thats part of living with someone and not having your own place. i think its time for you to get a job and move out on your own. i know not having a car is a drag but they have other means of transportation to get back and forth.
cP03k3cXaa	I agree with most of the posts here, BUT, if you want the freedom to come and go as you please have you tried speaking directly to them, your parents? Anything can be fixed through communication, ask them what it would take to have the freedom to come and go as you please. I personally believe that respect goes both ways, including between parents and children. If your parents truly believe and trust you then I don't see the problem. I tell my son all the time, I can't fix it, if I don't know it's broke. So go talk to them, you wanna be an adult, then take charge, be an adult, and talk to them. I'm sure they want you to be happy, if they don't agree, then do as most people have suggested here, move out. But you can't plan until you talk to them first, you never know until you try!|`|BRT2teSqaa	You can still go to college and get a job.  Many college students do.  Get a job, and get your own apartment.  That simple.|`|gH5FPXURaa	listen listen.....i just turned 20 like 2 weeks ago...since i was 17 i had all those privilages..whyy...bc i told my pops what it is..i said trust me or dont ....but i know what is right nd wrong|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Is it too unreasonable to support yourself and live in your own home at 19?  It is time to grow up...all the way..not just how much it suites you.|`|KzF33SYaaa	No its actually normal...you grew attached to many things and that's just the way you feel. My cousin is 25 and he thinks the same as you|`|AA11303010	At 19, no (except for the drinking part.....that is unreasonable. Of course your parents aren't OK with that. If you were my kid and you were drinking at 19, you'd be lucky if I let you out at ALL, forget all the other freedoms you want).<br>  <br>  For a 19 year old living at HOME.........A RESOUNDING YES. You are WAY outa line. I'm 24, so I'm not that much older than you and I'm telling you-you want that kind of freedom, it's time to REALLY be responsible for your own life and get your own place. Being a "young adult" with the freedom to "do as you please" kinda sorta implies you are responsible for yourself. Living at home pretty much means you aren't.<br>  One or the other, I'm afraid dear. You EARN those freedoms, you don't just get them because you added another year to your age. Being an adult is more than a number. When you are DOING adult things (paying your own rent and bills and DRINKING RESPONSIBLY AND LEGALLY ;-) then you get those freedoms. You can't have it both ways<br>  <br>  ***KUDOS TO ABOVE POSTER "You're basically saying you want to be a young adult in your freedoms, but you still want mommy and daddy to put a roof over your head like a child. You'll be treated like you're in an inbetween stage as long as you stay in one." ***** Took the words out of my mouth|`|T9fek24eaa	The key phrase in this is "I live at home." If you want that freedom you have to get out from under your parents roof. It may seem totally hideous and completely unfair, but give it a few more years and you will realize how completely fair it is and how good you have it. Being an adult is not all it cracked up to be... I was 19 once, I remember how I thought it was and man I got a kick in the a$$ when I joined the military at 19 and was FINALLY out on my own... nothing like spending your Friday and Saturday nights crawling through mud with a rifle on your back and still dont get a beer after that! <br>  <br>  You can move out but take into consideration, those Friday and Saturday nights that you want to be out partying may just be spent working because you have rent to pay and the only way you are going to get that done is by working your butt off. Enjoy it while its still there... you will miss this some day.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	In a way yes and then no. You are living at home so you should respect the house and not come home late, but then on the same foot you should be allowed to stay out whenever you want. If you arent going to make it the polite thing to do is to call your mom and tell her I'm not coming home tonight dont worry love ya see you tomorrow. As long as my kids were letting me know what was going on I wouldnt have a problem it would be when they are living at my house not paying bills and dont even have the respect to call and let me know so I dont worry. Every day parents have to cut the leashes that they have on their kids, and everyone deserves the right to grow up. Good luck|`|KsoepfyLaa	Hello.<br>  Actually it is your choice to do as you please but you must keep in mind that getting home & not hanging out for a long period of time is better for you. When you drink keep a limit to get home.|`|zUiNPk3Paa	you're an adult. unless you're mentally or physically disabled, your mom is now just a friend|`|dMLLQruOaa	Yes its unreasonable. Just because you of age doesnt mean that you can live in their house under your own rules. Im sure your parents want you home at a reasonable hour so you dont get into a situation such as "Like if its aguy friends house and I drink too much" Personally, if i were still living under my moms roof, it would be unnacceptable for me to go out and drink (especially underage) and call her for a ride. If you want to be a young adult and do as you please then get a job and your own place, pay your own bills. Until then, your not an adult without adult responsibilites. Sorry but you dont get the adult perks without adult responsibilities.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I was going to agree with you till I saw the drunk part.. I dont want some drunk daughter out sleeping on couches whereever she happens to crash..thats not a grown up. Grown ups dont get that wasted.<br>  Thats an irresponsible teen|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Their house, their rules babycakes!<br>  Want to do what you want to do?<br>  MOVE OUT.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Is it too unreasonable at 19, no.<br>  <br>  Is it too unreasonable when you are 19 and living at home, yes.<br>  <br>  You are a young adult, but you aren't living on your own.  The kind of freedom you want comes when you are living in your own place and paying your own bills.<br>  <br>  It is very reasonable for your parents to expect that you are home at a reasonable hour and are where you say you will be.  <br>  <br>  If you want to be a young adult and do as you please, move out and pay your own bills.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  When I wanted my freedom, I went out on my own.<br>  I got scholarships, and worked my way through college.<br>  I didn't get a dime from my family---but I also made all my own choices.<br>  <br>  The sad truth is that you are not "on your own".<br>  You're not "indpendent".<br>  And until you are, you can't call the shots.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I'm the same age and not able to do any of those things either. :P  It's a pain in the butt.  If I didn't have to drive my parents wouldn't tell me what time to come home, just NOT to after a certain hour, but I can't get around without borrowing their car, so I am home by 1. :P  Like I said, it's a pain, but at our age we're perfectly capable of working until we can afford to move out.  It's hard right now to find work and make that kind of money, so I'm moving on campus next year for precisely this reason!<br>  <br>  You're basically saying you want to be a young adult in your freedoms, but you still want mommy and daddy to put a roof over your head like a child.  You'll be treated like you're in an inbetween stage as long as you stay in one.|`|lBw50ySpaa	You can't expect her not to worry like the parent she has been for 19 years.  If you are under her roof, she is going to be worried when you are late.  Then there is the respect for her home routine part.  When I was working, I wouldn't let my teenager work late in the summer, because I knew I couldn't sleep until he got home.  Even if I did go to bed, I wouldn't want someone coming in and waking me after my bedtime.  <br>  It may be weird, but I don't worry about my 19 year old who is away at college in downtown Atlanta.  Even though I know he goes out very late at night sometimes.  <br>  One thing you and everyone should remember is to never go anywhere without telling someone where you are going.  If you did disappear, precious time that should be spent looking for you could be lost, because no one realized you were gone.  I got more news for you.   Being an adult does not mean you get to do what you please.  In fact, it means that you are respectful and thoughtful of the other people in your life.  <br>  Maybe you could work out a compromise with her.  For example, if you are not going to make it in by 11pm, then you will call by 10pm to let her know.  Also, you will tell her where you are, but she has to respect your decision.<br>  One more thing though.  Passing out at guy's houses can be dangerous.  You can't always be sure who they may allow to come and go.  And if you are drinking, then they probably were too, and may not be able to protect you.  Please be careful.

I think its better they get their knowledge from somewhere. video games, not too crazy about that bc it doesn't really teach them anything other then fight, and find a hidey spot.

wuZXqYPGaa	wow girl you got it rough!!! the first thing you should obviously remember ALWAYS is that its never you fault ever. frick like you didnt get to choose whut mom you wanted or whut dad. and it just sucks that they blame it all on you. but my mom came from a similar situation.. she had a dad that was an alocholic and came into and left throughout her life, her mom was uber abusive and slept around, and somehow it made her stronger and made her want to NEVER b like that ever.. she went through so much pain and i know you r to but just hang in there, becuz if my mom turned out like her parents did, then i would have a fucked up life as well. and i just thingg that its not ur time to just rebel n crap...dont take the emotional n physical abuse ur rents r giving you, if its horrible and un bearable then talk to a social worker SERIOUS girl. hang in there-- when ur 18 you will be OUTA THERE and free :D dont be negative always look on the postivie side even tho it seems like there never is one. if you need to chat im here :) wish ya all the best|`|d7kGopYxaa	get emancipated.|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	If your life is this bad then there are family members that know this and also understand the situation that you could possibly stay with or even a friend.<br>  If that can't happen then you should call Family Service to see if they can get you out of the situation you're in and that can put you into a foster family that might be good or what you have now.<br>  Until the right answer comes to you keep your chin up, know that their problems aren't yours and you're not the fault of their problems.  Walk tall and regardless of the problem at home do the best in school because those grades will get you to where you want to be in your future.  <br>  One last thing, if you reported/called the police on your dad and they did nothing then make a visit to the Court House in the Family (mind went blank, sorry) but they can give advice or direct you to where you need to go to defend yourself and there's no cost.|`|ADtfT5L3aa	omg i am so sorry! i cant say anything other than try calling the cops again, if that doesnt work, then child protection services! talk to a school counselor or close teacher if nothing works because they will try to help you!<br>  <br>  good luck! i hope it all works out for you!! ?|`|a5tItBhYaa	child protection services you said he got "locked up" if that means jail it could turn into something bad  even if it doesnt. when it gets to the point you have to call the police then CHILD PROTECTION SERVICES|`|41U6UBu5aa	try calling child protection services|`|JLcQAWgpaa	id like to talk to u aim i have a similar situation do u just wanna talk?|`|zRQmWC5saa	I would tell a teacher, call the cops next time u heard them yelling or something. that kind of abuse is sometimes worse than a hit in the face! ur mother is scared to be with another guy , I think.  she needs to dump him for good!|`|kRaVa0Wraa	Well, I'm glad that youre mature enough to realize that this has everything to do with your dad and nothing to do with you.<br>  He sounds like a real family man *sarcasm*.<br>  Why the hell is your mom still with him? He sounds like a huge baby.<br>  <br>  I would call CPS....if youre being emotionally abused they can get you out of there.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	write out all of your pent up feelings and exactly WHY you feel that way. Write down who is doing and saying what. You'll feel much better.<br>  THEN, take all of that and give it to your school counselor. That will make you feel even better!
J46ZifmJaa	Hey sweetie,<br>   hey i was bleeding for 3 weeks and me and my husband went to the hospital a lot and then i had pain and they also told me my cervix was was closed and the baby was fine as long as your levels rise and rise like mine have, i dono then.<br>   I went threw the same thing they ran alot and alot of test on me they just said lots and lots of bed rest and then the bleeding finally went away. <br>   All i can say is rest and stay off your feet and see the doctor and get a ultrasound since that is the only way you will deff know. And don't stress yourself out, everything will be ok don't worry ok keep your head up and hope for the best<br>  I hope all goes well sweetie. if you need someone to talk to im here. email me k<br>  <br>  Katlynconnelly@yahoo.com|`|ITCknAHVaa	It can be normal to spot, but I would seek a checkup from the doctor very soon to make sure nothing is wrong.|`|JNr7grCXaa	it's very normal at 5 weeks to be having some spotting.<br>  <br>  i don't want to say youre not losing your baby..because things DO happen. but chances are-youre fine :)
zPxzBd3oaa	buy kids toothpaste, believe me, the different flavors really help|`|AA10688386	It may be a reaction to the toothpaste stuff. Try using only a tiny bit of it  or else try salty water or try using baking soda which cleans well and is safe. Some toothpastes have only baking soda.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Don't do it on an empty stomach. I took my tooth brush to work with me and brushed after my stomach felt a bit more calm. If I really couldn't stand it I just brushed with water. If it's the mint flavor bothering you try a different flavor. I think the strong taste was my issue so it didn't help me but it does some.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	It goes away. I had that problem till I was about 12 weeks along and then it went away. I seriously couldn't brush my teeth without gagging. it was terrible!<br>  Good Luck :)|`|6558e1177abb6a029748d359090ee9f9aa	Sometimes it can be your toothpaste that you're reacting to, so you could try changing to a different brand.  Also, as long as you're gagging, temporarily stop brushing your tongue (go back to it once your morning sickness has subsided.)<br>  I hope you feel better!|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	this sounds stupid, but i found that if i didn't look in the mirror while brushing my teeth, i didnt get as nauseous lol. <br>  other than that, i dk what to tell you except maybe watch tv or something while you brush your teeth so you arent really thinking about it.|`|cXm6cLcpaa	Just try simply, breathing deeply through your nose as you brush...<br>  <br>  I've noticed that when I don't breathe very much when I brush, I have the same problem...  Now I'm a guy so I'm definitely not pregnant or anything... lol!  So idk if that would make a difference...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	That happens to me too.. Try doing it before you eat.. and try not to go to close to your throat.
WfMXn9hMaa	if yours is a low risk pregnancy, then 18 weeks is about right.  That's when the organs are developed enough to see clearly.|`|06wcIi76aa	Well, I'm no expert, and I've never had children, but yea, that seems way too long to wait for an ultrasound. I think ultrasounds should be given from the moment pregnancy is discovered. With all the defects and problems so many babies can acquire in utero, I think early ultrasounds are a must at the very beginning of pregnancy. As far as finding another O.B., you're the only one who can make that decision. If you told him that you'd rather have an ultrasound done sooner rather than later, I think he would have no choice but to comply with your wishes. If not, then yea, I think you should get another O.B. After all, it is your body, and your child. Congratulations on your pregnancy! :)<br>  So do you want a boy or a girl?<br>  What will you name him or her?|`|EH6ExoV6aa	It depends on when you started your prenatal care with your physician. When I first found out I was pregnant I went to a free clinic and they did an early vaginal ultrasound to make sure everything was fine and to tell the age of the fetus (I was 6 weeks). But I had my official ultrasound was at 18 weeks with my OBGN and found out I'm having a boy. I wish you the best of luck with your pregnancy.|`|lmk3mKJgaa	I got my first one done when I was about 6 wks to make sure the due date they got with the ultrasound was not to far off from what they got at the office. then my ob/gyn did the one to check the baby out I was about 18 wks but i had one a month after that cuz they thought she would be too big and I was involved in an auto accident. so they needed to make sure everything was ok. that was with my last one. with the first two the doctors said between 18 and 20 wks but with all three of them all three doctors did one after the first visit to check the dates.|`|TxYcs9H9aa	A lot of doctors only do one ultrasound during the whole pregnancy and it's usually around 20 weeks.|`|sCgutulVaa	You can do them as early as 2 weeks on. It just might depend on the doctor|`|gUIhXGNeaa	I was 5 weeks along, you could barely see anything though, it was about the size of a bean.|`|OUtcHIm0aa	i was 90.|`|VC4MGPHJaa	I think as soon as you have discovered you are expecting? Which is about 3 to 4weeks along.  After that time your doctor should be setting you up for an ultrasound.  If you feel your doctor is not looking out for your best behave then maybe you should look for a new ob.|`|AA10819958	they usually have no need for one until about 18 to 20 weeks unless you have had complications now or in the past.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It's normal. I had my first and only at 20wks. If you have a healthy pregnancy that's likely the only one you will have.<br>  <br>  It was a long wait but everyone was healthy. Not long ago ultrasounds weren't even routinely done.|`|75l2smfCaa	I got my first at 9 weeks, just to make sure the heart was beating and taking measurements. I am 17 weeks and have not gotten one since. Some people dont even get them until they are 20 weeks. If you want one I would just ask. Never hurts to ask :) Good luck tho, hope you get to see your baby soon!|`|2AhcNaBzaa	I got my first ultra sound at about four weeks but that's only because I was very sick and had to go to the emergency room getting one done that early is not normal unless their is a problem in the pregnancy so yes this is normal to have to wait 18 weeks and trust me if you get one done before that you really wont be able to see anything anyways it would just look like a dot|`|DDnxY3k1aa	if u feel like u are ready for it.. whatever u find there.. me i wait till i'm more round and people notice me so i know it's a better chance of seeing something in there.. cuz i don't want to be disappointed.. despite what all i've gone through to try to get pregnant. i may see something now.. but one can only hope...|`|Y1Lb5f4Eaa	My OB waited for 20 weeks because they can do a full anatomy check. Its very normal if you have a normal pregnancy,|`|duinadV4aa	my first was at 9weeks
SJx9IWWtaa	I think they sorta graze over the sex ed talk.  I had mine in 6th or 7th grade, and we learned about our period, body hair, and how we might be attracted to boys.  "oh my"  lol  But we never got into the actual details of sex, or sexual activity.   So in a way...you could almost say sex ed was a teaser.  They flaunt sex & puberty in your face, tell you about condoms and birth control, opening your mind to that information but not filling in all the blanks.  Thus...the thousand questions on yahoo.<br>  <br>  This is personally a reason I like teens being able to ask questions on yahoo.  Granted they don't always get the answers their parents would have wanted, at least they have somewhere to turn with their questions if they don't feel confident they could go to their parents or other family.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Yes, they do.<br>  <br>  The fact is, kids don't care.They have lack of intelligence and suddenly "regain" it when they realize that they are pregnant and it was a mistake.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I've seen my daughter's sex ed books.<br>  <br>  They are so dry, and boring that I don't think kids actually connect it with "sex". I was also horrified that even with sex ed, kids still have some of the same ideas we witnessed as teens.<br>  <br>  At some point, a parent MUST make sure that their kids actually understand what is being taught. Uncomfortable? No...it doesn't have to be. But having a pregnant teen is a lot MORE uncomfortable.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	You can lead a kid to class, but you can't make them learn.  <br>  <br>  As far as in-school sex ed, we were taught Puberty 101 in 5th grade, with Sex Ed, Pregnancy, Birth Control and STDs in 6th grade.  <br>  <br>  I would think that even an abstinence only education would include the basics, but maybe I'm wrong.|`|1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	I'm a teacher that previously had to teach the "sex ed" class to eighth graders.  It was amazing to me what these children did not know about STD's, reproduction, sex, etc...  I couldn't believe that some parents never spoke with them about these topics.  They really wanted to learn, and not just about sex. (although some were sexually active).  They were curious and confused and ultimately (although it was a wee bit uncomfortable at first for them) glad to have the opportunity to talk to a trusted adult about the questions they had.  I agree that the "birds and bees" talk should never be "skipped".  If the schools don' t provide it, the home should...kids are suffering from diseases, and becoming pregnant at an alarming rate.....education could help.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I had sex ed probably like 5 or 6 years ago in school, but it was pretty bad.  They mentioned condoms and BC pills and how the body works, but never gave us any practical information we could USE.  My mom never taught me-- so now as a 20 year old, I just found out about emergency contraception in like August when I NEEDED it.  Knowing before then might have been nice, my friend told me about it the night before I needed it by pure coincidence-- I'd probably have been pregnant otherwise.  The fact of the matter is that so many parents are squeamish or lazy or WHATEVER it is, and they don't give this talk because they don't want to encourage their kids to have sex, and they dont let the schools do it for the same reason, and then when they are young adults-- THEY STILL DON'T KNOW.  What's more alarming to me than the fact that kids don't know these things is how many classmates I have in college that don't know either, because they were never taught!<br>  <br>  But on the other hand, I had to tell my mom what a cervix was when she found out she needed a hysterectomy.  So I guess things are getting better!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	It is sad, indeed.  I read some of these questions and just think "WOW", and not in a good way.  Certainly if they do not know the basics, they should not be sexually active.  <br>  <br>  My 11 year old daughter knows more than most of these ignorant (meant in the true sense of the word, not as an insult) CHILDREN.  Guess what?  My children are homeschooled so they get their sex education from me-mother and teacher.<br>  <br>  It is very obvious that in a lot of cases the ball is being dropped, both in school and by the parents.  With the schools, I think it is in regards to trying to cram everything into a short lesson or series of lessons and the fact that many teach abstinence only.  That, and I remember taking sex ed in 7th grade.  It was a complete joke.  With the parents, I think that they do not realize that there does not need to be A talk-their needs to be open, honest communication from an early age about the body and sex.<br>  <br>  Sex education has no business being taught by the school, but there are so many parents that are too embarassed to take care of their responsibility in this aspect that they have to.  And, that shame continues cycle after cycle.  Break it!|`|AA10526033	I know when I was in high school everyone was still too giggly to actually pay attention. All they really taught though was about contraceptives and why you should not have sex and this was like 9 yrs ago. It's kinda pathetic though that common sense doesn't even kick in with some of these kids.|`|411c9e50db3e6aa419765275e1da7d4aaa	i think i learned about the reproduction system in 5th grade science...<br>  <br>  it should be addressed or else there will be a lack of knowledge of sex. i remember seeing some statistic that shows that pregnancy rate went up when the schools stop teaching sex ed.<br>  <br>  <br>  my school might cut it because of budget cuts.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	biology should be taught in schools and is. birds and the bees should be taught at home. and really in this day and age even if parents won't give the talk there's a ton online (didn't have that when i was growing up). so there's no excuse.|`|AA11303010	Actually I feel it is quite the contrary. I think sex ed is everywhere, we just have a generation of lazy, small minded children who couldn't listen attentively if their lives depended on it. <br>  I think another thing is that since sex ed is so common in schools parents have shirked their responsibilities to talk to their children on these issues. So parents are assuming that our wonderful public educational system is handling their dirty work for them, so they wimp out. <br>  Therefor, kids aren't listening in school and their parents aren't doing the right thing at home. And we have the result-kids who know NADA|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I think your questions is a perfect example of people blaming public schools for something that should be the function of the family. If my kids are that uneducated about their reproductive organs and sexual knowledge, it is MY fault and my fault alone not the school. Kids are embarrassed to ask questions about fractions, the civil war, and writing a paragraph, yet at school they should feel comfortable enough to ask, in front of their peers about their hymen? Give me a break. The whole idea is ludicrous. I am not saying that it should not be taught, but I do not think it is the sole job of public school.|`|lu4ufhm5aa	I believe it depends on the state as to what extent the students are taught. A lot of states are opting for the "abstinence" education. If you are REALLY interested you can contact your local school district|`|oSMNx6L5aa	I agree with you. I became a mom at 14. I never had "the talk" I think it should be taught in schools, although I knew everything that was needed to know, I was one of the ones who said "oh it won't happen to me" Children need to know what can happen and how to be safe, sex can be a very dangerous thing if you don't know what you're doing. With all of the diseases and other things out there you never know what could happen. <br>  <br>  I know it may be uncomfortable but if someone doesn't teach children about it and the possible outcomes of not being well educated could lead to some horrible things. I know so many teenagers who are pregnant and have no clue what to do, how to parent, anything. I am very responsible for my age and my boyfriend and I work very hard to take care of our son, but there are to many teenagers who have no idea what they're doing, it really saddens me.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	Our local news just did a story on this and they interviewed a local principal.  He said that if you don't teach it, you get calls from parents and if you do teach it you get calls from parents.  I think we need to look at the way it's being taught (or not taught) in our schools.  So many parents are neglecting to talk to their kids about it and they need guidance from somewhere.  I think they need to be taught the good, bad and ugly of sex.|`|riOQ4Jveaa	If the schools are teaching it or not, heck!! I thing it is mainly the parents responsibility to talk about sex with their kids. And I mean  the bads and the goods. Parents now days need to be concius about this, and stop dumping this issue to the schools teachers.|`|LJDiSCCNaa	I think kids don't really listen in school...ESPECIALLY teenagers! LOL sorry, but it's true. she was probably still trying to figure out how the hell the tampon works that they gave her in her little "welcome to womanhood" tote bag.|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	I can tell you I just recently went up to our middle school and had a lovely rant at the principal and vice principal for what they are teaching in their version of sex ed.<br>  <br>  I had no idea that when they said an "absintence based" program that meant they were going to teach my child such illicit terms as "anal sex" or "mutual masturbation". I also had no clue that they were going to harp on the ineffectiveness of condoms to the point where my son would ask me, "If they don't work, why use one at all?" I could go on, but suffice it to say, I was appalled. I thought he was going to learn about the various STD's, forms of protection available, how the reproduction system works, and what changes his body is fixing to go through with puberty. After I finally saw his book and what all was in it, I was appalled. After I read it, and how they negatively portrayed condoms I could see why my son thought they were worthless.<br>  <br>  Suffice it to say, the principal had no explanation. The vice principal hadn't even read the darn book! All they had was the ability to sit there with their eyes bugged out, their jaws hanging wide open, as they tried to keep up with me. I had highlighted everything in that book, that I found offensive and inappropriate for 12 yr olds.|`|7geLpG6Oaa	First and foremost the parents need to be teaching it, they need to start young and cover all their basis. My son is 2 and I have already started talking to him about the difference between boys and girls. He has a little sister and he's curious. I have told him he has a penis and she has a vagina. As he gets older and more curious I will explain to him what ever he asks me. <br>  I do think things should be brought up in school as well because, for whatever reason, a lot of parents don't talk to their kids about sex. I know it was a taboo subject in my house and I learned a ton of stuff from a really great book. I think if I would have had a more open relationship with my parents when it came to sex I wouldn't have gotten into some of the trouble that I did.|`|T9fek24eaa	I absolutely think you are right on that. Back when I was in school we started getting "sex ed" in 5th grade. It was not like a year long class, they did it once or twice a year and taught girls about their periods and things like that, we got the "Are you there God? Its me Margaret" book LOL! Then "health ed" was offer in high school. <br>  <br>  Honestly I had no idea what the hell they were talking about when they started telling me that I was going to start bleeding! My mom never talked to me about that. I think that there are still alot of parents that do not talk to their kids about the birds and the bee's and sex and being safe and all of those things SO in turn, I think our schools need to make sure that kids know this too. There is a right and wrong way to learn this stuff and everyone learns it at some time and I think that has a big impact on things in that persons life.<br>  <br>  Edit- I read one of the other mom's comments and was so shocked! I am sorry but I am so against abstinence only sex ed. The taught us about pregnancy, prevention and STD's... nothing about mutual masturbation! that is insane! I would go pitch a fit in the principals office too if that was being taught to my kid. Teach them something USEFUL!|`|galoGEOFaa	Sex ed has been dropped in many schools due to whiny parents not wanting their kids to hear about such things from their schools.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, these same parents don't have the balls to talk to their kids about it themselves.<br>  <br>  Not surprisingly, these same parents have cable TV and the internet and don't bother to monitor their children on either, nor do they keep track of where their kids go after school or on weekends.<br>  <br>  These poor parenting skills have resulted in a massive explosion of teenage pregnancy that those of us who have a full understanding of the male and female reproductive system, as well as contraception, will spend the rest of our lives working full time jobs so we can continue to support these kids who have no idea how they even got pregnant in the first place.<br>  <br>  Do I believe it should be up to the schools to teach these things? No. But if the parents aren't going to grow up themselves and actually take some responsibility and BE parents, I'd prefer the schools step in than have to work the rest of my life to help pay for a dozen welfare babies.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	It sounds like you are having sciatica, which is really common during pregnancy. The sciatic nerve is huge (about as big around as your thumb) and all the extra weight, stretching, pelvic shifting that goes on during pregnancy can really irritate it.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest going to see a chiropractor and a massage therapist (that specializes in prenatal and therapeutic massage) to help alleviate the problem. For me I have found that doing prenatal yoga has helped with that pain a lot as well. Keeping all the muscles stretched out helps take some of the pressure off of the nerve. It's not something that will threaten the safety of you or your baby so they would not put you on bed rest for that, but it could make you very uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Good news is that sometimes it gets better on its own once your body adjusts to the changes. Until then you might want some help from some bodyworkers. Good luck to you!|`|IVNM1O5naa	The same thing happened with me when I was pregnant. Your baby could be laying in a way that is compressing your nerves. It should get better in time.|`|AJ10p6M0aa	The hip pain is pretty common.  It has to do with all the stretching your body is doing.  It stays uncomfortable but it has never caused me any real problems.|`|lqlfIEjNaa	Causes of Hip Pain During Pregnancy<br>  During pregnancy our bodies release hormones that help relax and soften the joints and muscles. This happens to help prepare your body for labor and delivery. Believe it or not release of such hormones occurs as early as the first trimester. Typically the release of hormones into the body however doesn't affect most women until they are further along in their pregnancy. <br>  <br>  As your body and uterus continues to expand and grow, your posture may become more awkward. Your muscles and ligaments respond differently to the presence of relaxin in the body. Relaxin in the body helps the pelvis move around more easily in preparation for birth. Unfortunately it may also increase your susceptibility to injury and also result in some hip pain during pregnancy
mMzXeOhmaa	My situation is a little different, seeing how i am getting financial support from my parents still. However i had the choice of getting a job, but couldnt do it. Aidens father and my parents told me they would rather him not go to a daycare until he is about 3. So my parents said they will help take care of us financially until i finish college(online courses) and get a job(by that time aiden will be about 3) <br>  The thing is i did decided to get a job as a sub at a day care. I figured my son will be right there in same building with me, i wont work all the time. However i hated it! I could hear my son screaming in the room next to me. i just wanted to run home with my baby. I hated that i had to take care of other peoples toddlers and listen to my baby cry knowing i couldnt help him. sounds bad, but it wasnt for me..The stuff they do, is stuff doctors and everyone tell you not to do. Like they put blankets over the baby to help them sleep(hello risks of sids) They do not let you pick up the baby when he/she is crying. Idk i just decided to wait until aidens old enough to go to a day care. <br>  Im so happy to stay home with him and spend this time with him, while i can. I get bored at times, but then i remember id rather be with him than out anywhere else without him.|`|3fJ8IMRVaa	Is it possible to cut out the Cable bill ? The less you drive to work is the less your spending on your gas bill.. your also saving by not eating out at lunch , your saving Daycare expences and extra Dr Visits because the more your child is exposed to other children of simular ages ( that come and go around other people) he will get sick more often .  <br>  Its all up to you , I do my best to be home with mine , I know a lady that milks goats at 5am in the morning to stay home all day with her little girl .

It is not that I wanted to but after my husband and I separated I had too. Now I know what adult life is like. I work on the days that he has them. He picks them up on Monday- I go to work, pull 16 hrs, do the same on Tues, and only 8 hrs on Wednesday. Then usually he is bringing them back on Thursday. Sometimes it get hard because I don't have time for me but being a full time mom can be very stressful. Now days it takes 2 people working to survive. But maybe their is a gas station nearby or something like that, try and stay away from the 9-5 things if you only want part time. Maybe even go back to school-follow your heart!|`|s4aX6bF6aa	working and staying at home is a personal decision for any woman...i choose to stay at home and love every minute of it...watching my kids is so fun a lot of the time...they are funny and cute even if they are into everything all the time...good luck with your decision.
azE51WGRaa	A stillborn is a baby who has passed away inside of you (it's miscarriage but only when you're farther than 4 months along). Usually the doc. has to give you a bunch of inducing medicine and you have to have it. I went through it with my first daughter.

T9fek24eaa	I did this only ONE time that I ever remember, and it started at 5 dpo as well. At 9 dpo I got a BFP! I believe it was implantation cramping. It was off and on until about the time I was supposed to get my period.|`|c26jYQBoaa	I have the same thing happen to me every now and then.

2jiNLOKHaa	the skin test can only be read at the earliest 48 hours after it was given. if you take a pen tip and can catch a lip on all four sides of the bump in the middle then it just means that he has been exposed to it. then he will get a chest xray to confirm if he has tb or not. i always swell up after getting them. my body just doesn't like what they are made of. when i got back from africa once, they could catch a lip on only three side of the bleb...or bump. the chest xray was negative and i have not had any problems since. unfortunately if your honey has tb you have already been exposed as well. your doctor will come up with a treatment plan for you both. don't put the cart before the horse though. waite the 48hours and then get the test read and go from there. a lot of times it calms down a bit in that time.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Positive TB skin test does not mean that he has active TB. He does need to let someone know that he had a reaction. I believe he could have an allergic reaction but I believe it is rare and highly unlikely if he has had one before. <br>  If he Did have active TB, then yes, he should be in quarantine away from everyone, including you. But like I said, a positive TB skin test does not mean active TB.|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	having a positive skin test doesnt mean he has tb. he was probably exposed to it. if he was around you a lot they probably have you tested too. what usually happens next is a chest xray. and if the chest xray comes back negative they put pts on a 6 month drug plan usually with a drug called inh. <br>  if the xray is negative he can be around you. but if the test is positive and it turns out he has tb he cant stay around you until he starts medication and has 3 negative sputum test.|`|Km6QTk9Caa	I don't know if baby in pregnancy is affected or not.   <br>     TB can be treated,  it doesn't have to be a long term thing,  people recover from it.   <br>  But please try not to let your mind run riot and worry so much.

All that the positive skin test means is that he was exposed to TB, but unless he has active TB, he is NOT contagious.<br>  <br>  I had a positive skin test, and I am pregnant.  I have to start on antibiotics after I give birth to suppress the bacteria from becoming active.  After the 9 months of antibiotics, you are fine.<br>  <br>  So, relax.
Vqqc54oNaa	I think its dumb. Do they think there is going to be a buch of "tweens" watching dora and boots try to get swiper to not swipe! Dora's made of toddlers and really shes very educational. Theres going to be many many more toddlers they should leave her as is. If its not broken... don't fix it!!|`|3HR1SfGMaa	ugh way to ruin a nice wholesome image!  I can't believe they are doing this, my daughter loves Dora, even just got new Dora toddler bedding, but if they change her to be more "sexy" as they are calling it, we are boycotting!  This is exactly why I don't let me daughter have anything to do with Bratz merchandise.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Ughhhh I hate it. They need to try to gain a new set of viewers not grow up with the toddlers who first loved it. I think what they're doing is ridiculous. What is there gonna be a high school Dora a few years from now?! I think shows like that should stick with one age group.<br>  <br>  PS I really enjoyed that "makeover" slideshow thanks for posting ;)|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	I hate dora.|`|N0EHtPKsaa	i agree! sex is over rated and upsetting, and it's happenning younger every generation... it has to stop!|`|af96mcl1aa	I agree with you. They need to leave her as she is.<br>  <br>  Very sad.|`|KeevlZnTaa	I don't think it is necessarily bad. However, I hope they keep her an energetic, self assured, confident character that makes choices to help others. I think the t.v has enough "pretty", "popular" girls that think shopping and boys are all there is to life, so if she stays out of that mold I think it is ok.<br>  <br>  I can completely see their reasoning for changing the character(from someone who has studied business and marketing). I knew right away why they are choosing to change her, and it makes sense.<br>  <br>  She is no longer going to be an adventurer, but a middle schooler, living in the city. From what I heard they are keeping it a "mystery" solving show.<br>  <br>  She is no longer geared to preschoolers(which is why some parents are upset). Parents have to realize that her content is not going to be for 2-4 year olds anymore, and the fact that she has long hair and legs is b/c the target audience has changed. Preschoolers should not be watching the new Dora, it is not age appropriate anymore.<br>  <br>  I can personally see why Nickelodeon is trying this out, they see the dollar signs. Sexy, skinny, fashionable, etc dolls make money(that's the fact no matter how wrong it seems). They are hopping on the "Bratz"/New Brabie bandwagon and hoping to increase profit by having a niche in the industry of fashion dolls, which is more likely with a show attached to it. Dora is already know to people, therefore there is less need to advertise and introduce people to the character, which saves money. The controversy is even better(marketing wise), b/c it is free advertising on news and internet for the show.<br>  <br>  I am not sure if tween Dora is going to bring in any older girls to the show. I think most tweens will still see her as a baby show, and most adult know that when kids think something is "babyish", they don't want to touch it with a 20 ft pole. I think this is going to be a hard see to tweens that want to be cool, and disassociate themselves with anything childish or "for babies".<br>  <br>  I personally see nothing wrong with making Dora older. Diego's show still has the same elements as Dora did, they were practically the same show(and in my opinion Diego was less annoying).|`|KmC0K59taa	I agree.  So is the little Dora gone now?  My daughter is 2 and I sometimes let her watch Dora, but I won't let her watch the new Dora.
13efe42c1b43aea736580b4a5176e231aa	you really can't.  I had to have two and i thought i was the only sane person who really WANTED to go into labor.  I wanted to have that experience but because i was too sick the first time, and hadn't started having contractions the second time i had to go through it.  You can try to tell yourself at least you won't have to be in any pain till after the c-section,  you'll have a beautiful baby, and you don't have to get stitches but honestly, if you really wanted to do the labor or you just don't want to do surgery there's no real way to psych yourself up for it.|`|LX0vjwXPaa	Listen to an audio recording of a "natural" birth without "drugs"; then realize you'll be high as a kite and feeling little to nothing when you bring your beautiful baby into this world.<br>  <br>  My wife had a child by C-section, and had nothing negative to say about the experience.  It took her a few days in the hospital to recuperate.  The main issue she had with it all was the scar that was left, and I understand it is much less obvious with current procedures.|`|Axle82kMaa	Your vag won't get tore up? lol<br>  <br>  That's the only thing that keeps me hopeful if I have to get a cesarean..|`|ksWm9eCBaa	I felt a sense of 'defeat' when I stopped dilating at 8cm and had to have C-sect.  Then the fear came.  It was all fast-moving, no time to anticipate as you're experiencing...but it was scary just the same.  I worried for nothing:  a small scar that was very, very tender (burning feeling for me) for several weeks (right where the top elastic in my bikini bottom hits--bet you already have one?).  Hopefully, your C will NOT be as hard to recover from as whatev your "extensive surgery" was?  It's not a very time-consuming procedure, and probably less 'probing', etc. than your previous surgery?  Just take a small, comfy pillow /w you to hosp: use it if you have need to cough or when someone tells a funny joke...laughing & coughing hurt--but holding that pillow snuggly over the incision will help.  It also helps ALOT to (carefully!) get up and get moving as soon as you feel you can, after the epidural wears off.  If you're planning on breastfeeding, that helps the fundus (uterus) go back to it's original size.  That gradual shrinking can be a bit more uncomfortable /w a C.  Ask the nurse to bring you a dose of Acetaminophen (Tylenol)BEFORE they bring you the baby...give it a few extra minutes to work before your fundus feels the nursing effects.  I then found that the couch was more comfortable when I returned home.  It's (of course) lower than my bed and easier to manuver up n off to a standing position.  I was glad to get out of hosp, but missed those helpful side-rails of the hosp bed!  Then, always remember to do what you've heard:  when the baby sleeps, YOU sleep.  More rest=quicker recovery.  Hoping you'll have help...the laundry,dishes, etc can wait...YOU and baby are more important!! <br>  Will part with this:  had a friend who had her first baby vaginally---and claimed that her inches-long episiotomy felt like 1.5 feet!  Slow-going for weeks. Had C next baby and was up/down stairs within 2 weeks!  Her comment, "Geez...if I'd known the difference, I'd have demanded a C round one!"  Your lil darlin' will make it all oh-so-Worth-it!  <br>  Bless your heart, as we say in Tennessee!!!|`|AA11520456	I had a C Section myself last December 2008.<br>  <br>  Don't worry it is not scary at all and 2days after the operation, i can walk already BUT not run....(of course)<br>  <br>  I'm happy that i had a C section and spared me from getting into labor which i think I can't handle. I didn't feel pain at all. It's just that after that operation they will not allow you to walk or sit yet. You still need to fart (excuse me for the language) before they allow you to move. <br>  <br>  After you're out of the hospital you will be ready to take care of the baby because I'm sure before you get out of the hospital you can already walk and fix things.<br>  <br>  I have low tolerance for pain BUT see I got through it and I didn't feel pain at all. <br>  <br>  Maybe your Uterine surgery and your C section will be different. Don't be afraid. I'll pray for you!|`|DS21ekeJaa	NO LABOR! Your baby will be born without a cone head from the birth canal, you will have much less bleeding afterward, there is no chance of the cord wrapping around the baby during delivery and causing problems. <br>  Yes, surgery is a risky procedure, there is more recovery time for your body and it hurts in a different way. Just remember, newborns sleep a lot and don't run around so you won't be chasing the baby. Accept whatever help is offered and regain your strength by following doctors orders. You will be sore and happy at the same time!|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	well the thing is, they do them all the time and they are completely routine. There is a bit of a recovery time but my mom had me c section and both my friends had their boys by c section and healed up rather fast and just fine. You may just have to kinda be easy pickin up your baby and standing up but you will be fine sweety ^_^
JITTMjasaa	There are a million potential reasons. I think that it is our bodies way of telling us what we need. Your cravings of fruit juice and berry things could be your need for more vitamin C. Try getting a bag of mixed berries and yogurt and making yourself yummy shakes. Peaches and pizza could be a need for more iron as peaches, tomatoes, and red meat all have iron. Try eating foods with iron every day ;ex. apricots, raisins, peaches, red meat, spinach, tomato products, broccoli, beets...The fresher the better and try to load up on foods with vitamins and vitamin enriched foods like cereal. Have a happy pregnancy and good eats! God Bless|`|w9jx0JYLaa	I also wanted icecream from mcd all the time the first couple months :P<br>  <br>  I've craved peanut butter banana sandwhiches, pineapples, and orange pop and popsicles|`|5ItOGyVHaa	Mc D's ice cream. we drove 4 hours to visit his family and i stopped at 3 Mc D's to get ice cream on the way. <br>  <br>  some people believe that there is something in the food we crave. for example i might have been needing more dairy in my diet and my mind just said "ice cream" <br>  <br>  just don't over due it. with each trimester you only need an additional 300 calories for baby. but in case you do over do it and gain a little more weight that you need too.... just try to breast feed when baby arrives. it can burn up to 1000 calories a day.
JgiGOpG8aa	to have sex within 48 hrs of ovulating and the day of ovulation, deep penetration, u need to orgasm too, and yeah get your partner to have a coffee before hand. lol. goodluck!!! im trying for a boy too so let me know how you go!|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Believe me every time you get pregnant you have a 50/50 chance of either sex. I have tryed every old wives tale and none have been successful for me. I have come to the conclusion that i was just meant to be a mum to daughters. I am 7 weeks pregnant and if i have another girl it won't bother me at all, i've never been around little boys so i don't think i have missed out on anything. I would however love my dad to have a grandson especially after having only daughters and now having 5 grand daughters. We get the gender that we are destine to have, lets face it all we want is a healthy baby. Good luck but don't believe in the wives tales, because thats all they are....tales.|`|10csHNHkaa	My experience is, males carry y and x chromosome's not sure which is which but they carry more of one depending on the weather. I got prego with my son with warm weather, and my girls when it was cold weather.  good luck, hope ya get what ya want!|`|J2f5ZzSnaa	Um..pray? <br>  You cant choose, it just happens!|`|6ri7AYC1aa	There's no way to make yourself concieve a boy. It's all about chance. You're either going to have a boy or a girl possibly both. But you and your husband have no control over it.|`|qo2u1BCoaa	some inconclusve studies show that you increase the chance of having a boy if you drink apple juice.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I think these are all myths. It all depends on the sperm.|`|zprAkP3eaa	You cant plan something like that!
syrh8J6Vaa	I have heard if you have sex prior to your ovulation day you have better odds to conceive a girl.  The sperm that contain the boys don't live for as long and the sperm containing the girls are stronger and last longer.  So if you have a sex a day or two before ovulation you have a chance of the sperm contain boys to die off and gives more odds of a girl.<br>  <br>  edit- I couldn't remember the name but here it is!  It is called the shettles method!<br>  <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com/Faqs/Gender-Selection-The-Shettles-Method.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com/Faqs/Gend...</a>|`|S5GP2nlUaa	haha nothing the male determines the sex not the female
5ItOGyVHaa	YES I DID!!!<br>  <br>  when i was 16 i went to my very first OBGYN and found out i was covered in cysts. lots of medication later i was told i would probably never have kids. my uterus was so scared from all the cyst that the egg wouldn't be able to implant. <br>  <br>  i had a miscarriage at 19 and when i was 23 i had a fertilized egg get stuck in my tube and they removed it. so i took a very slim chance and dropped it by 50%<br>  <br>  i would always say i couldn't get pregnant without a DR's help. well that was almost true. when i met my husband a medic in the army at 29. he got me pregnant on my 1st ovulation. we had a wonder full baby boy. then when he was 7 months old we got pregnant again. another boy. <br>  <br>  he is deployed now but we are taking steps to not get pregnant again so soon. some thing neither of us had ever had to do before. <br>  <br>  keep the faith.|`|hpJdK2ULaa	i had an abnormal uterus. was given 20% chance, wanted a boy got it, made me happy and scared, thought it was true as i tried for two years with my ex, we seperated, and bam got knocked up. i was only a teenager, my ob told me sometimes it corrects itself as my body grew, wad 17, 20 now and ttc for 3 months, scaring me|`|V3n5t2tAaa	They told both of my parents they wouldn't be able to have kids in the future but hey look I am 21 years old.  First when I was in my mom belly they thought I was a tumor or soemthing but I wasn't.  So don't listen to doctors.  If you don't have any kids there is always adoption sweetie remember that.|`|PNPg9Ytkaa	Yes ma'am!! At 15 I found out I have REALLY bad endometreosis and a tilted uterus and I was also given about a 3% chance of getting pregnant... I was on birth control since I was 15 to help with the endo pain but 2 days after my husband and I got home from our honeymoon I was put on antibiotics for a sore throat... well we were newlyweds and quite "active" at that point but I didn't bother with another form of BC because I was on the pill and my chances were sooo low... well what do you know I got pregnant!! My pregnancy was complication free! I had no morning sickness and even worked up until 2 weeks before I gave birth.. I had a healthy 8lbs 8 oz 21.5 inch baby girl (though in the begining I wanted a boy and my hubby wanted a girl but we found out she was a girl at 20 weeks and I was excited)|`|T9fek24eaa	I have been told that twice. Once when I was 16 and I had an infection in my fallopian tube that left me with alot of scar tissue. The doctor told me that I would not be able to have kids (they never gave me a percentage) so I went to see a different doctor and he told me "No one can ever tell you if you can or can not have kids, because miracles happen every day." Those words have stuck with me since then. <br>  <br>  THEN, when I was 21, I was married and we were trying to get pregnant and after a year we still were not pregnant so I started going to my doctor trying to get some help, again, a different doctor. Then they diagnosed me with polycystic ovarian syndrome. They referred me on to a specialist. When I went to see the specialist I dont think I ever had a more hopeless feeling than I did then. He refused to help us because we were young (both 21) and I was overweight (which PCOS cause you to gain weight) and sent us on our way. Little did I know at the time that I went to see that specialist I was ALREADY pregnant! Some how by the grace of god, we conceived on our own with no fertility treatments or drugs.<br>  <br>  I had a fairly uneventful pregnancy, up till the end and I developed some minor complications. I wanted a girl and I got a HEALTHY beautiful baby girl! <br>  <br>  NOW I am on my 2nd pregnancy. I was not as lucky this time to get away with out taking meds. I took metformin and clomid and got pregnant on my 2nd round and I am expecting triplets... that happens to be a VERY slim side effect of clomid (.5%, half a percent chance, of conceiving triplets) and I beat that odd just like I beat the odds of getting pregnant with my first with out help. <br>  <br>  SO you know what, I had a less chance of getting pregnant with triplets than you have of getting pregnant AT ALL. Miracles happen every day and to all of us. The final decision is not up to your doctor... Good luck.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Yep, docs told me I wouldn't be able to get pregnant because I have severe endometriosis and a rather large fibroid that they didn't want to operate on.<br>  It didn't change much when I was first told because I was young enough that I didn't really WANT kids yet. They didn't give me a percentage, but they did say that it was basically a one in one thousand chance that an egg would latch after it was fertilized. I've had a few problems with this pregnancy, threatened miscarriages and the like. But as soon as that happened I put myself on bed rest and took it easy and haven't had any major problems since.<br>  I wanted a girl originally, we're having a boy and to be honest I'm pretty happy either way.

AAlB49iraa	ask her to tell you her favorite drink. try and get it for her. get her a straw and have her sit down with you and read to her or watch her fave movie. hold it up to her mouth and try and get her to sip it. hold her. let her know you love her. she will drink it. yes it's possible she missed you and is  faking a little or overdoing it a bit. tell her sh'll have to get an IV if she doesnt drink. Another trick is to get a shot glass size cup. or one of those medicine cups, and give her 1-2 ounces every 10 minutes. it's not so overwhelming to drink 1 -2 ounces. give it to her and set a timer for 10 min. you can easily do this 10-15 times and she won't realize how much you are getting her to drink. also if her throat is sore try popsickles or crushed ice.|`|1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	If she's dehydrated, you would be able to "tent" the skin on the back of her hand.  Pinch/pull (lightly!) a bit of skin on the back of her hand, if it snaps right back, she probably isn't very dehydrated; if it takes some time to go down, then she is certainly dehydrated.  Also check to see if her eyes appear "sunken" to you.  Call your ped. and see when you can get in to see her/him.|`|jLI0IgWkaa	oh well, if she's not phased one bit by your threat to the hospital, then that just may very well be where she'll be staying for the next few days. (if she was dehydrated, why'd the ER doctor send you home???)<br>  In the meantime see if you can get her to suck on pedylite freeze pops.|`|fNv2Re6baa	Try letting her have softdrink, milk, hot chocolate, cordial. Start her off with other liquids, then gradually move to water.|`|il14uGAlaa	Ask her if she wants a milkshake, or her favorite soda. Even a smoothie, orange juice, lemonade. Even ice cream might work. Start of with that, and then get more liquids.<br>  <br>  And that "IV trick," well you might just have to get an IV tapped in her if she gets really dehidrated.|`|i2Ytn70Yaa	Force feed her water, or juice, or any liquid (besides alcohol) and make sure she swallows it. Even if its soda, still give it to her, but not too much. Give her atleast 6 8-ounce glasses of liquid, especially water and o.j. everyday.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	She is most likely dehydrated. Your husband may be right, she just want attention. Make sure she gets fluids, but give her too much attention. It will only teach her that she can easily get what she wants.|`|DjuyMrgPaa	You say she hasn't been to the toilet much, so maybe the reason she's not drinking is because she has a water infection and it hurts when she goes to the toilet. Maybe shes too embarrassed to tell you and made up the bit about her throat hurting. It might explain her back hurting too.<br>  Sit her down and ask her if thats what the problem is.<br>  The doctors can't just leave her as she is, as dehydration will eventually kill her if left for a long period of time.<br>  Failing that, try giving her more attention. Maybe she is jealous of her brother getting all the attention. Take her for a day out with just the two of you or let her pick a place to go and lavish attention on her. Tell her you love her very much but you have to give attention to her brother right now.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Buy her pedialyte or Gatorade.They contain electrolytes.Perhaps she really does have a sore throat and it hurts.<br>  <br>  <br>  And if she is doing it for attention, spend some time with her.|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	Have you tried giving her popsicles?   Not only will they help with the dehydration but it can help her throat to feel better.
IU4uNH97aa	the name Vivienne I loved it 4 years ago and it was a top contender for my daughters name but now I'm hesitant to use it because i don't want her growing up and being refereed to as Angelina Jolie's daughter. I just sucks because i love it and it has lots of meaning to us but i just can't bear to use it now.<br>  <br>  Also Isabella i love it but i could never use it because its so popular now. Alice also I love it as a middle name but its becoming popular by the whole twilight debacle. Just like all the other good twilight names Edward, Emmett, Jasper , Rosalie etc.|`|1eLOi65Zaa	My grandma's name is Mersini and I think that's a wicked cool name.  Traditionally, it would be my name too, but the thing is, my Grandma refused to go to my parent's wedding because my mom isn't Greek (Orthodox.)  Thus, my mom wasn't so wild about naming her children after her.<br>  <br>  I don't have any qualms about my grandmother, it's not me she slighted, but in general I'm not so wild about name my (future) kids after anybody--even if it just incidently.  When I call their name's I want to think of them exclusively while still respecting my family and friends in their own way.|`|F2cVt5jaaa	YES! <br>  I like the name Allesandra..but I would never use it because of my mother inlaw.<br>  Her name is Sandra|`|Elxuvon8aa	I can not stand the name charlotte because of a person known to me the names Sophia chloe zoey Shilow Maggie Tucker Mattie Mia are all dog names of extended family thus no longer childrens names|`|6yD5k9Azaa	YES!<br>  <br>  i love the name Raven but i knew a girl that had that name and i disliked her.<br>  i love the names Alice, Rosalie, and Emmet... but twilight ruined that for me.
ZZzQLjaKaa	If we knew that we would be rich! There is no way to tell. Dilation and effacement have no predictive value until you are dilated beyond 5. Good Luck! I have gone way over with both kids so I know what it is like to wait!
AA10953561	It sounds like a logical reason to me. I can't say for sure of course, but it does make sense to me. Perhaps you can ask your doctor about it at the next appointment. I've had the same tight feeling for a while now, and while sex doesn't necessarily hurt, it is definitely uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon!|`|AA10967880	i would say its normal i have not got that far in my pregnacy but i heard. that sex is excellent during pregnacy. i suggest you keep it up to help with your labour. maybe you could be dry and not know. try some lube and maybe just get him to go a bit gentler aswell or maybe just only put half in.|`|vdnn7tysaa	dilating wouldn't effect how it feels. you can't tell when you dilate until you start having contractions or your dr says so. so it could be that your body is just now adjusting to the swelling and pressure. just be lucky your having sex, my husband wanted nothing to do with me and its still a fight now.|`|AA11089301	you feel tight down there cause the babies head is so low and taking up all your room, having a tight feeling vagina has nothing to do with dilating, or a loose feeling, the baby just changed positions so your more comfortable in that area.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	I am 36 weeks and it hurts me too! I was checked yesterday, and as of then I wasn't dialating yet, but you could be. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|aZRTTPn8aa	Could be, GOOD LUCK!!|`|QqwPoeVjaa	if you have sex while pregnant, your baby could be born with a condition known as "semenitis twinfacitia"... which is basically means it will have an extra set of fully-functioning genitalia growing from its upper torso.  Please be careful if you choose to be sexually active during pregnancy, especially during the last trimester.|`|6a65TIrgaa	You have to use chocolate as luberacant, this may sound a little messy but it does help. Also on a positive note, chocolate helps provide nutrients to the baby. The chocolate will also help tighten the vaginal walls so it will feel better. Enjoy!|`|6qhRFXZwaa	Yes, You could be. All the best!
wOLoYW7jaa	It used to be that doctors would say not to give them vitamin supplements - but they are now finding that kids are not receiving the correct amount of Vit D and other essential vitamins they should from being out doors - mostly in the winter time and are now recommending that you give them a daily vitamin - Flinstone Chewables have a vitamin out for young children between 1-3 I believe.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	It will help keep him healthy.<br>  <br>  My son takes vitamins.|`|K2h6M1xqaa	Get your doctor to answer that.<br>  <br>  "Vitamins" often is a catchall word to mean pills which are concentrated minerals and other chemicals your body needs.  However, when they are very concentrated like that, they can be hard on the kidneys and liver.  --I knew a guy who worked at the Canadian Liver Foundation, and he told me that vitamin pills were one of the leading causes of liver damage in adults.  Your body is designed to absorb these kinds of chemicals through natural food sources, not from pills.<br>  <br>  Be very careful, and ask your doctor about this!  Children, because their body mass is so small, are much more affected by drugs and supplements of any kind than adults are.|`|af96mcl1aa	Yes, to keep him healthy!<br>  <br>  My sons pediatrician recommend Poly-vi-sol drops. Vitamin drops for babies/toddlers. You can find it at Wal-mart for around $6.00. I give him the full dropper once a day in his morning bottle, and he doesn't seem to mind the taste difference, let alone even notice it! <br>  <br>  It also comes with a $2.00 off coupon inside the box for next time. :)|`|02xxwMRBaa	as long as the vitamins are for 14 month olds.<br>  my daughter takes vitamins too but shes two. and only because she doesnt eat a whole lot of vegetables and fruits in a day so the vitamins give her what she needs.|`|4qrH4pVraa	I would check with your doctor. If they have a balanced diet they don't usually need vitamins.|`|5d1uZn1Yaa	I give my 1 yr old and my 2 yr old those  chewable flinstone vitamins. It will only help them get their nutrition...because all they want to eat is junk! So i think it's a god idea to continue to give your child vitamins to help them get that extra kick of nutrition that they all need to grow.|`|SPavwdMOaa	i don't think you should<br>  or well it depends on what the doctor says<br>  because some babies might be allergic or something
484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	If you weren't ready to become a father yet - then why didn't you wear a condom? Surely you aren't that stupid? <br>  <br>  If the baby is yours then you don't need to be involved in it's life if you don't want to. But you will definitely need to help pay for it's upkeep. Why on earth though would you want to make an innocent child feel so worthless? It didn't choose to be conceived after all. Shouldn't you at least attempt to be there for it in some small way? <br>  <br>  It seems very cruel and cold hearted that you would want to abandon your baby completely. You may not feel ready, but you didn't really give your ex-girlfriend much of a choice did you? Maybe it's time to grow up and start acting like a man. :-)|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	get yourself a lawyer and get a consult on how much it will cost to sign off your parental rights. by the way when you sign the document you are no longer financially responsible for the child and the mother can not press you for any child support. best wishes.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Get a DNA test on the child at birth, you can sign your parental rights away so you will not be entitled to the child what-so-ever, but im sorry to say it dose not get you out of child support. You will have no rights to the child but still have to pay for it|`|SSgjlQGoaa	Depending on what state you are in you may not be able to sign over your rights. Two parent states don't allow you to just sign off on your parental responsiblities.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you cant just sign your support obligation away dude<br>  youre misinformed ..The judge will order a test ..and youre stuck|`|4A8lGwYJaa	dumbass should have wore a condom|`|c5AJGcYcaa	If you sign over your rights then no you do not pay child support. You have NO rights to this child ever.<br>  <br>  Im not sure what you are asking here because you keep saying you want to sign over your rights then what legal choice are you asking about?<br>  <br>  If you sign over your rights you really cannot fight to ever be in your child's life. And you leave her totally raising a child on her own without any type of support. If you didn't want to be a father no offense you should have been more careful. I honestly believe signing over your rights because of this situation is a chicken S*** way out.<br>  <br>  Youre man enough to have sex and get a woman pregnant (if it is yours) then be man enough to help her support your child.
K2jT1z5jaa	Yes darling.<br>  <br>  if you havent recieved a call back to make an appointment - Then the results should be okay and fine.<br>  <br>  Keep strong x- This is good- x<br>  <br>  God bless x|`|vKEYa8aeaa	yes, no call is a good thing. most all doctors dont call with results unless there is something out of the usual or bad with the results.
IAllZ5bLaa	here are three types of tests out there that i know about , two pee tests and a blood test.<br>  <br>  One pee stick test is 5 days before missed period. Sadly, this one is not accurate in the before 5 days part (it even says so on the box only 65% roughly at 5 days before and more like 75% on 2 days before, and 99% on day of missed period) and the regular pee stick is day of missed period.<br>  <br>  Why is this? Those tests and the most accurate blood test all search for a hormone in your body that is only present when pregnant. It actually means your body is the determining factor for the hormone to show through your urine and some people's bodies don't show the hormone that quickly. I'm not sure how soon the blood test works though.<br>  <br>  Either way, the hormone should be present in your body by the first day of your normal period start time. Though people like my mother sometimes never show the hormone at all! I wouldn't worry about it unless you miss your next period or start having the tall tell signs of pregnancy.|`|436fREgIaa	3 weeks after you had sex.accurate as ever. if you had sex since then..wait another 2 or 3.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	You could attempt it now, but honestly the best time is wait and see if you are late with your next period.
LTD0qL6Yaa	I think from all my experience with HPT's that if you already have a BFP i can't see any reason why you wouldn't get another positive. Putting it off won't make it any easier, and to give you a huge boost if your positive result line appeared really quickly and was dark that means the test has detected a high level of pregnancy hormone. You are PREGNANT, Congratulations......Make sure you are taking your pregnancy vitamins and sit back and relax. I can tell that you will just LOVE being pregnant, well done and "good things really do come to those who wait"....|`|2jiNLOKHaa	i was like that when i found out i was pregnant too. lol! i am 10 weeks and change. i went to the doctor the next day and it was confirmed with a urine test adn they did two blood tests to make sure the hcg was going up and all is well. well, kinda. i been bleeding and having some issues but mostly everything is ok. keep your head up adn think positive. you don't have to waite until morning. go get a box of the first response ones and do them all if that will make you feel better. :) congrats!!|`|xjRCdRnxaa	Hey sweetie, i think id be the same if i get BFP - especially since you had a [past false positive (Ouch, thats awful!)<br>  But get some moe and pee away and book into the Drs but i would say youre preg sweetie and well deserved, good - sticky baby dust :-)<br>  xxxxx|`|CsjR9Vwsaa	Congrats Hun, You are pregnant. Go ahead and test in the morning but still call your doctor and set up a appointment so you can get everything going. That way you can have blood drawn and urine and everything else. <br>  <br>  <br>  CONGRATS|`|KlJHZRSiaa	False positives are SO RARE, I can't believe you got one. You are most certainly pregnant. And yes, take another one tomorrow too if you like, but as far as I'm concerned, you're in the Mamma Club :) Congrats xoxoxoxoxox|`|awOqygQiaa	congrats! your little angel has arrived :) take some good rest and good luck! :)|`|QR6IHIZxaa	try different brands and if most are positive congrats :)|`|y5sWmbtnaa	YAYYY!

If you want something, and you dream about it, you see it, you believe it, it will happen!!! Just believe, and keep praying! everything will work out!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well congratulations to you! I'd have to say that false positives are so incredibly rare that for you to get two of them would be unheard of. Also, I hate the digital tests, they are IMO the least reliable.

I'm sure it will go well in the morning and you can celebrate even more. :]|`|ehvzQRkkaa	False positives are rare! Congrats!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Congrats - i would say that you are definantely pregnant!!!<br>  <br>  I used a first response, and got a very faint positive 5days before my period was due - i tested again on the day i was due and got a very strong positive.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats|`|RE6GBw0Baa	oh hunni thats fantastic, i too have been ttc for 15 months. i know how much this will eman to u.<br>  <br>  try not 2 worry hunni, im sure before u know it ull have ur bump and there be no denying it lol. <br>  <br>  make sure u keep us updated.<br>  <br>  congrats mommy 2 be :D xx|`|WBw9lDG8aa	congrats and good luck positive hpt are really rare ;oads of baby dust to you.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	your pregnant!

Then, just wait for the phone to ring with shrieks of delight! :)|`|Xfhk7YxSaa	Wow - future mother in law is 1800 miles away!  You're the luckiest girl ever!  LOL!  (Sorry, that's supposed to be a joke.  It's lame, I know.)<br>  <br>  When I found out I was pregnant, the pregnancy test my doctor had given me was square and just had a + sign in the middle.  It was sealed, so it wasn't icky or anything where I'd wet it.  Well, Mother's Day was a week away, so I wrapped it and gave it to my mom.  She opened it, politely said thank you, and laid it to the side.  I stared at her.  My husband stared at her.  My daddy, who'd been sitting beside her, stared at her.  She stared back.  About 30 seconds of silence with all the stares.  Finally, I asked her did she know what it was.  She said yes, a timer.  Pregnancy tests are so much more obvious now than they were just a few years ago, so maybe take an extra pregnancy test and UPS or FedEx it to her.  Don't forewarn her of the package, but clearly return address it so she'll know who its from.<br>  <br>  Anyway, a giant CONGRATS on the baby!|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Congratulations!!  My son and his wife came to my home with his video camera and was taping. They said they had a surprise for me and told me to close my eyes and hold out my hand. So, I did. They put a baby pacifier in my hand. I just looked at it...the pacifier not registering at the moment..and said ..what is this for? They started laughing and just looked at me. Then it hit me!! Oh my gosh!! Are you pregnant? She was..I started screaming. My first grandbaby too! Maybe you could send her a package that says Congratulations! and have baby things inside it. I think that would be cute. And if you had an ultra sound pic of the baby include that as well. I'm sure anyway to tell her she will love it!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Get a little onesie that says grandmas girl or something like that. Make a copy of the ultra sound and put that in a frame and if you can send her some flowers as well. Maybe go to one of those sites that takes fetchers from both you and your husband and makes what you baby will look like and send her that. Send her a nice letter about everything thats going on.|`|zUkaqbRDaa	I was 7 when my first sibling was born and my mum gave me a beautiful box with some baby clothes, a little rattle, bottle and a bib that said *I love my sister* of course i guessed right away what it meant! you could send her something similiar, with a cute little card inside also!|`|2VdJgenjaa	Send her a Brag book. You can get them at any gift shop, basically it's just a photo album if you've had your first ultrasound put a copy of the photo in there for her.|`|t1VXsGpwaa	just start talking about babies and how you want one then say what if your gonna be a grandma???? then be like CONGRATS YOUR A GRAMA!!!! :)|`|977eab4a315d43905b937b86490bae16aa	Now your an old laddy,Ma.|`|4wGhBQoWaa	I don't know if this would be considered cute but you could buy a picture frame the says "mommy + daddy = me" . they sale them at Kohls, or many other picture frame stores. And then on the "me" section put a picture or some kind of design that says "boy or girl"<br>  <br>  have fun|`|0qP8gLpyaa	scan a picture of the sonogram photo and print it (if she has email do it in email instead) and put as the caption "I Love You, Grandma.. see you in November" (or whatever month your due).|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Send her a "thinking of you" card with an ultrasound picture in it.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	send her some baby shoes. My future sister-in-law told her parents on Christmas, the shoes were tied together and then wrapped. Her mom and dad sat next to eachother and each opened a shoe at the same time.<br>  <br>  #1 Grandma shirt, coffee mug, etc. If you've had an ultrasound, mail a copy to her. All these ideas are cheap and very cute.<br>  <br>  Put on the outside of the box/envelope: "Call us when you're ready to open!" So you can hear her start to laugh/cry/whatever :-)<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	If you can afford it, send her a bunch of flowers, and enclose a card with the news.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you can always call...and maybe sing it to her?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jQwYoRCXaa	Maybe you could send her something that says #1 Grandma or Worlds Greatest Grandma. Did you get an ultrasound yet? Maybe you could frame a photocopy and send it to her...Congrats!|`|SJx9IWWtaa	Buy her a grandparents day card (though I know its not anytime soon).  And inside write, congrats your a grandma.  :)
2jiNLOKHaa	that's what happened with me. i didn't even test until 4days after my missed period because i was sure those cramps meant that my period was on the way. i had them the first few weeks and still get them occasionally, but not as bad. it is normal. it could be the baby still getting nestled into your uterus or things starting to stretch in there. i had my first ultrasound at 5 weeks and 5 days and there was already a little bubble in there. i could see how that could cause some pain . if you aren't spotting i wouldn't worry too much about it. it is normal and common for that to happen in early pregnancy.|`|a59e66ccd067c54ffacd8913af678510aa	thats normal i have them also and i'm 8 weeks. the only time you should be worried if you see red blood and clots.|`|tJMYZ9Xuaa	no you're not...its your baby stretching your uterus preparing room for himself...im 17 weeks and still get period like cramps every now & then! so its all G-O-O-D!|`|yNoENquTaa	yes it is normal to get cramping at the beginning of your pregnancy and for you to carry to full term.
C4AUC5vGaa	it's just not disrespect towards moms, it's disrespect to fellow human beings. I don't think the guy in the grocery was being rude to you cause your a mom, he was just being rude period. There are quite a few people in this day and age that have no manners. Unfortunately we all have to live with them. Just keep being nice, perhaps it will rub off on some people.|`|FgWx0hfPaa	you should have told the waiter dude in the restaurant, "just how in the f**k to you think you came along mother f***er" <br>  <br>  LOL but yeah seriously|`|gFiRi5xnaa	I'm sure its not moms in general, those people are probably jerks to everyone.|`|lGcpXteaaa	Oh i dont know how old you are, but if your not young you have no idea about the disrespect i get!<br>  Rude comments, dirty looks....I just think eh? My daughter is treated right, she is safe, she is properly cared for...etc...<br>  Why do they look down on me so much??<br>  <br>  I have to say i cant really understand why other people would disrespect older mums though....i cant see any reason to disrespect you...|`|1WSFNX35aa	Hahaha you go girl.<br>  <br>  I don't have any kids myself.. so i haven't actually come accross anything like that.<br>  <br>  I actually find myself in the opposite situation when i take my 2 year old niece with me. <br>  <br>  People are really nice and they try to make things easier for you.<br>  <br>  If I were you i would have yelled at that guy at the restaurant.<br>  <br>  I can't believe that actually happens to you. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should move to New Zealand like me ;)|`|2qntbDGKaa	go you! i've been in that type of situation before too! when my youngest son was a baby i was in line at walmart getting his prescription filled and he was crying b/c he was sick this stupid bi*ch behind me was like oh my god i wish that kid would shut the hell up so i turned around and cussed the stupid cu*t out... i just hate the way ppl w/o kids respond to people w/ kids EEEHHHHHHHH|`|hIoxij6eaa	I was at the shops with my eldest in a stroller and my newborn in a baby carrier and I had to dodge out of people's way. Its like they don't even look where they are going and if I decide, no, I'm not moving they only get out of the way at the last second and give me the dirtiest look. Its so rude. Its not like they could miss seeing that I'm coming! In a crowded shopping centre its much easier for a single person walking along to move than someone with a stroller. I have noticed though that they do it to people in wheelchairs, people struggling with giant shopping trolleys and people on crutches etc etc etc. Its just plain rudeness and only caring about themselves.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	How do you know that the guy was being a jackass because you had kids? he could just be a asshole all around.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I would complain about him to the manager/owner and tell them that they lost your business.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Man! That waiter is a tool and I hope he doesn't have kids himself. Well at least you got the food for free though. It's not just moms being disrespected, it a human thing in general. Plus I agree with being in a supermarket and somebody is holding up the line for some nonsense crap, he could've checked the expiration date on the coupon before buying something.
HEdGGmkhaa	Headaches are a sign of hormonal changes, yes this happens in early pregnancy but can also come when your period is due<br>  <br>  If you are trying to conceive I hope you are, baby dust to you!
01Mu3wUeaa	Well, you claimed that he was like a big brother to this girl...maybe that is why he cannot severe ties so easily as you wish.<br>  <br>  You basically need to tell your husbandthat this chick is really stressing you out and that is a big no-no for pregnant women and little fetus babies.You have to sit him down and have 1 serious talk about this.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't want to think of you and his child, leave him until he grows up and sorts out his main priorities (children come before ALL)<br>  <br>  You should also put a restraining order on this kid.If she comes near you and is going about in a threatening manor, call the police and have her committed.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rFwGnZIJaa	Personally, if you have asked for him to have no contact and he do so anyways, the marriage is over. That shows he has no respect for you or your marriage and has no impulse control. I would leave him with his little freak. A marriage doesn't consist of three people. Also if you have no trust in him how can you continue with being married to him? If I didn't trust my husband I couldn't be with him.|`|AJ10p6M0aa	Make sure to file police reports for every incident and get a restraining order.  Try this explanation for your DH: how is he going to feel when she crosses the line and hurts or kills you or his baby?  That may sound rough, but if she is getting prgressively more violent, it's a wakeup call he needs!  If he still refuses to cut contact, you must leave for the safety of you and your child.|`|YMjk8Jhxaa	I agree that you should get the police involved because someone that mentally unstable could harm you or your child or even your husband.  Call them everytime she calls and harasses you or your husband and any time she comes to your property and damages anything.  Documentation is the key so that you can get a restraining/protective order!|`|5n1SkKl5aa	You should definitely leave, if only for your safety and your baby's safety. This girl sounds like she needs serious help. Make it clear to your husband that keeping this person around is destroying his chance for a happy marriage. If he doesn't listen, LEAVE. It will be hard, but it might be just the thing to jolt some common sense into your husband's brain. When you actually stick to your word and leave, he may finally see how serious this is and take actions to get this girl the help she needs.

Soooo we got a digital test.. I was pregnant! :)<br>  <br>  Try a digital test.|`|4AZp8Quwaa	Your pregnant. A line is a line. I took my pregnancy test about 4 days after my missed period and I too had a faint line. The package came with two tests and my boyfriend ended up taking the 2nd test because he was in denial lol. Said that he wanted to make sure the test was accurate. He's crazy, but anyways, I had a couple pregnancy symptoms before I was expecting my period and I "just knew". Had sore breasts which never usually happens to me, had no pre-period cramping that I usually got before I started and I was tired all the time. I know it feels unreal, but go ahead and congratulate yourself. You did it!|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, i think thats a congrats!! Your going to be a mummy! yay!!<br>  <br>  here are a list of pregnancy symptoms and signs, Good luck and congrats again! :)<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #1<br>  <br>  <br>  Missed Period<br>  <br>  Perhaps the most obvious early symptom of pregnancy is when you've missed your period. This possible sign of pregnancy is often what causes women to search for more details about the other pregnancy symptoms. <br>  <br>  Some women might only experience a much lighter period compared to their usual. You might not experience any of the pregnancy signs listed below until around the time you notice you've missed your monthly cycle. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #2<br>  <br>  <br>  Just "Feeling" Pregnant<br>  <br>  This early pregnancy symptom may be the reason why you are checking this list right now. Many women believe they have an intuition about pregnancy signs. Their intuition is often proven correct. <br>  <br>  Maybe you just feel different; tired, moody, queasy, lightheaded. You may also have heartburn, constipation, or find yourself making more frequent trips to the restroom. Perhaps you feel a dull ache or stiffness in your lower back, you have sore breasts or they seem overly sensitive, or you are simply not feeling like your usual self. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #3<br>  <br>  <br>  Breast Tenderness<br>  <br>  One of the very noticeable early signs of pregnancy is tender, swollen, somewhat sore breasts. You may notice this pregnancy sign at bedtime when you are trying to get comfortable and go to sleep, when exercising or showering, or when getting dressed. <br>  <br>  When you become pregnant, your body begins preparing your breasts for producing milk and breastfeeding. Hormones start increasing. In addition to breast tenderness and swelling, your nipples may feel sore or extra sensitive. Some women notice their nipples darken in color. <br>  <br>  Your breasts play an important role in childbirth. They are naturally sensitive and become far more so when pregnant. This is one of the most obvious early symptoms of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #4<br>  <br>  <br>  Fatigue<br>  <br>  One of the earliest pregnancy signs for some women may be fatigue and exhaustion. You may start going to bed sooner, or find it harder than usual to get out of bed in the morning. If you are working, by noon you may feel like you need to lie down. Exercising seems like too much effort. A simple activity like shopping may leave you feeling wiped out and lightheaded. This early pregnancy symptom is caused by all of the changes that your body is going through, plus the increasing levels of hormones. <br>  <br>  If you know you are pregnant, try to take frequent rests or naps of 15 minutes to a half-hour whenever possible. Explain to your family, friends and coworkers that you need these naps. Ask for their help in blocking out rest times for you.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #5<br>  <br>  <br>  Frequent Urination<br>  <br>  An early symptom of pregnancy that others may notice you experiencing is frequent trips to the restroom. Your family or friends may comment that you seem to be going off to the ladies room quite often lately. One cause of this pregnancy symptom is that the swelling uterus can put pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  Also, pregnancy causes extra body fluids to be processed by your kidneys and bladder. That means more trips to the restroom. Sorry to have to say this, but this symptom of pregnancy may remain constant for nine months. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #6<br>  <br>  <br>  Nausea<br>  <br>  One of these pregnancy signs of queasiness, nausea and vomiting can take you by surprise when you least expect it. These early pregnancy symptoms may come as soon as a week into the pregnancy. Many women experience nausea in the morning when they have coffee and/or eat something on an empty stomach. This is known as morning sickness (see below). Other women notice nausea in the afternoon or evening. Others feel queasy all day. <br>  <br>  This pregnancy symptom may often be helped by eating smaller, more frequent snack size meals. Many women say saltine crackers and milk seem to be helpful. This is an early symptom of pregnancy that seems to show up about a month after pregnancy has begun. It tends to level off once you are into your second trimester and your body adjusts to all the many changes it is going through. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #7<br>  <br>  <br>  Dizziness and/or Fainting<br>  <br>  One of the more surprising pregnancy signs is dizziness and/or fainting. Going up stairs, standing up suddenly after sitting for a time, or just having to stand in line at the grocery store can make you feel light headed. You might even faint. As the uterus swells it compresses arteries in your legs. This can drop your blood pressure and make you dizzy. <br>  <br>  A common early sign of pregnancy is that you may feel faint when you have gone a while without eating. This is due to low blood sugar, because that is your baby's main source of food. You want to eat frequent, healthy snacks to keep your blood sugar up. Stock up on portable lunch box foods you can take with you. Such as|`|K2jT1z5jaa	first one you took and threw away : will be wrong after 5 - 10 mins. As the test will evaporate and not be right. But ...<br>  <br>  the second one came up in the time its meant to be read. <br>  And yes faint is positive;<br>  <br>  Congratulations !!<br>  My early symptoms was only cramping. & on average symptoms begin week 6.<br>  God Bless x|`|lGcpXteaaa	I am going to say you are pregnant!! WooHoo!!<br>  It is so rare to get a false positive....let alone two!<br>  <br>  My first symptom had to be sickness and nausea. Everything made me wrench...<br>  Oh and then it was the weight :(<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope you all the best hunny!! Keep us posted x x
DRb4Qlypaa	You can get pregnant no matter what your profession. A doctor would probably wear maternity clothing after a few months just like everyone else that gets pregnant.<br>  Scrubs are pretty stretchy and if they wore those before then they can probably continue to wear the same ones.|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	Ignore all these people.  Everybody knows that when a Doc becomes pregnant she is immediately taken outside and shot.|`|KYdg8tpUaa	scrubs..they have maternity scrubs also..when in the practice they can wear maternity clothes with a lab coat..and when performing surgery..they wear scrubs..|`|SZOONQ1zaa	They Wear what they always wear hun. If a doctor usually wears scrubs then they still do, however bigger ones. Some doc's do consults and they wear casual dress, so they just wear casual dress maternity clothes. I am a nurse, I still wear scrubs.|`|DDnxY3k1aa	the same.. and yes they can be pregnant just like teachers and cops and they do.|`|AA10445507	they are humans after all|`|yNoENquTaa	maternity stuff if they need to.. what a weird question.|`|b2d4WaZlaa	can doctors be pregnant...??<br>  <br>  I found this question beserk and rather wierd but if it pertains to doc:s continuing with their professions at hospitals and clinics on getting pregnant then its simple answer: YES !!<br>  They ought to carry on practising as its their profession as no one would give them 9 months plus maternity leave !!!!<br>  Wearing Clothes of appropriate SIZE and COMFORT is what is vital & long coats (preferably loose) are apt in cold regions. During summers, it would be a bit problematic as soft cotton fabrics project the sized portions of the tummy buldge..<br>  How ever, after 6 months of pregnancy, it becomes rather difficult for the pregnant doctors to profess as it becomes embarrasment for the patients..at times.<br>  But---Kudos to Women Doctors: Keep Going !!!|`|gWiZAsfBaa	Yes, my OB was pregnant. My son's new pediatrician was pregnant. She recently had her baby.<br>  <br>  They wear what they always wear.|`|COWXFwKlaa	yes they can just like anyone else. and they wear their scrubs if they are at work..if not at work just regular clothes.|`|0iYoPLGIaa	this question then seeing the first person's reply was "what?" is making me laugh!!! hahah|`|tMeN2fm0aa	What?
lmk3mKJgaa	i have a IUC its mirena I LOVE it. just keep up with your follow up appointments and everything should be ok. i have had mine for almost 2 years.|`|tMeN2fm0aa	Try an IUD... I heard they were good.  Good Luck.|`|hpJdK2ULaa	whatever you do, dont do depo shot unless its your last resort. well if you dont really want kids, then its ok. most women have bad effects from it i was textbook oppisite. lol, i cant spell forgive me, but i lost alot of weight stopped bleeding, everything good, except now im tryin to concieve and cant, prob wont for another year or so, it usually stays in your body fat, and seeing as i got on it right after my son was born i had plenty
QR6IHIZxaa	is the bump somewhat hard? if so it could be a baby growing. Some women have bleeding in their first trimester of pregnancy, so you having light irregular bleeding is somewhat normal. And yes you craving something that you hated before is also a sign of pregnancy, before i was pregnant i barley ate meat and now i need it with every meal, im serious, once i craved pb&j sandwich with Salomi [lol]. so i would suggest a doctor :]|`|qfSKgxDsaa	just wait and get the test to be sure|`|3w7VztEWaa	yep sounds like you are too me!!<br>  go get a test silly<br>  =p|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	Well you were on the pill when you had sex so that makes it unlikely you got pregnant, assuming that you never missed any pills and took it correctly.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, the messed up thing here is that you've been thinking you were pregnant for, what,  as long as 4 months maybe? And you've even scheduled a doctor's appointment to check on this, but you never bothered to go to the drug store (or grocery store or Target or Wal-mart) to buy a simple home pregnancy test.  I mean, you just pee on the stick with many of them and it takes 6 minutes to get your answer.  Some cost as little as $1.00 (at the dollar store) and the most you could possibly spend on a HPT was like $15 for a digital.<br>  <br>  So yes this strikes me as a little nutso.  Especially when you consider that 4 months with NO prenatal care or prescription prenatal vitamins could be very very bad for you and baby. And when you consider that you haven't been following the pregnancy nutrition diet or avoiding prohibited foods/drinks in pregnancy  It just seems like you would have wanted to find out before now. You could run out right now to the 24-hour  drug store instead of asking questions on Yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  Maybe you don't want to know whether or not you are pregnant? <br>  <br>  Good luck either way!!!  PLEASE write an update and tell us what you find out.  Hope you get the answer you want.
Fd4lITkvaa	Once they break your water or if the induction was for medical reasons a c-section is pretty normal. You got lucky to have such a good doctor. Clearly your body and baby aren't ready yet. It's rare to have it happen but not unheard of.|`|IVNM1O5naa	hmm.. that is strange. Did they use Pitocin to induce you? That should of speeded things right along and they could have broken your water for you too, to speed things up.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	They change rules so much I am not sure. I did here about that last week tho a girl went in to be induced and got sent home..
cnK4X2sZaa	NO it does not harm the baby. it may harm your esophagus from heart burn... but no definitely not your babes. some women use it at the end of their term to induce labor.... whether that actually works or not is a different  question.<br>  so eat away. but maybe have some tums handy..lol.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	No, I've never heard that before. I think the worst that would happen would be that you got heartburn from it. I love spicy food as well and have been eating it throughout my whole pregnancy when my tummy cooperates with my taste buds. :]|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	No it won't, but you might just get some serious heartburn. I think the big problem is it's just hard on your stomach during pregnancy. At the end of your pregnancy it helps induce labor though.|`|KlJHZRSiaa	OMG that's so cute. If it was true, then women in India and Mexico would all have deformed babies :) LOL   <br>  <br>  No, it's not true. In fact, my first food craving in pregnancy was sardines in Louisiana Hot Sauce. Perhaps you're confusing it with foods that some people choose to avoid when breastfeeding. This is because the taste can get into the milk and the babies don't like it, but then maybe your baby will like Jalapeno Milk ... who knows :)<br>  <br>  good luck!!!|`|iUMrd7qlaa	No that was all my mom ate when she was pregnant with my sister and I and we came out fine. The doctors just prefer not to eat so much of it.|`|klTgOEcpaa	no it harm your unborn child but it may upset your stomach lol|`|y5sWmbtnaa	no it s not true. I have heard that spicy foods can irritate babies but not hurt them|`|IAllZ5bLaa	This isn't intended for any racism at all guys, but honestly there are a lot of spicy fooded cultures out there. They do not change this when pregnant and I've not heard of anything bad happening to these people.(generally speaking: no ulcers, no heartburn, no nothing). I have a Thai friend who ate super spicy stuff and she didn't have problems with her three children.<br>  <br>  If you're super concerned you could always phone up a baby doctor to be safe. It might make your BF feel better too. hehe, good luck with your pregnancy hun!|`|a3f410ddbc04b93827c78e13d31f2307aa	There are many cultures in the world that enjoy eating super spicy food (hot curries, spicy zechuan, etc.) and yet there are no reports of increased abnormalities in babies delivered in these cultures. I do not see how jalapeno could hurt your baby.|`|L6U1joGAaa	No. It's funny I asked the same thing because when I was prego I craved nothing but jalepenos on everything, and I mean everything.|`|2IPhSWkxaa	NO i would eat spicey food all the time when i was pregant and my daughter came out healthy and fine. my obyn just said to limit them as much as possiable. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|977eab4a315d43905b937b86490bae16aa	No,Does not harm unborn babys..|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	Not at all... But will cause heart burn in the 3rd trimester.
tuwql8exaa	i patted him on the back|`|LJDiSCCNaa	If he loves her, then I bless them as they make a life together. (not in my basement)<br>  <br>  If he does not love her, and it was a surprise, then I would advise him to treat her well or he could lose his child to time forever.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i would be very disappointed. <br>  <br>  hey - didn't you just answer someone else's question by telling them to get an abortion??????|`|AA11303010	You "planned" it but your parents have never met her?<br>  <br>  Poor kid. Good luck to you. Life's gonna be hard.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Well do you love her, would you like to be with her the rest of your life?<br>  If so, then tell your parents that BEFORE telling them you got her knocked up.<br>  If your not really THAT into her, decide what you are going to do about your relationship with her before you tell them, because it is important that you are in this childs life but depending on what you want with the mother changes alot for parents!<br>  They may want you to marry her.<br>  This is a lesson...don't be silly, wrap your willy!!|`|veO1RXrCaa	I can tell you that I would cry and then be mad and then try to deal.  What else can you do?<br>  <br>  ETA You planned it?  Good luck pal.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	The same way I would react if one of my daughters got pregnant when unmarried.  I'd be there for them...not to look after the child and take on the responsabilities of the child, ...that would be their job, but I'd woudn't yell or scream or anyting...what would be the point.  I would expect of my son...like my daughters...that they take responsability for the consequences of thier actions...that doesn't mean he'd have to marry her, but I would expect to see him be responsible and be there for his child every step of the way ...financially and physically.|`|OxFV92hJaa	I'd be upset, but I'd get over it and move forward. I'd want to meet her, and start helping anywhere I could, as anyone whos had kids would know...you need a good support system.<br>  <br>  First reaction would be shock, then confusion, then guilt, then anger, then being sad, then just accepting it and being there for you and your new family anywhere I could.<br>  <br>  Nothing else you can do. <br>  <br>  G'luck, love that woman, treat her like gold, be a good man and take care of that baby. It won't be easy, but if you do it right, it will be more than worth it.|`|MzHwklzKaa	If I was your mother and you were telling me, I'd point at you and laugh and tell you to get a job, cause you're going to be working pretty much non-stop for the next 18 years.<br>  <br>  SUCKER!|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I'd tell him to come on over with her and stay at our house for awhile!!! I love pregnant people. They make me happy.

N77uzTOcaa	oh, i've heard my share of these, such as:<br>  <br>  --if you concieve the baby while doing missionary it will be a girl. and if you concieved the baby doing other than missionary it will be a boy.<br>  <br>  --if the heart beat is a little slower it will be a girl, if its a little faster it will be a boy.<br>  <br>  --if your carrying low it will be a girl, if your carrying high it will be a boy.<br>  <br>  --if you have morning sickness alot it will be a girl, if you hardly or never have morning sickness it will be a boy.<br>  <br>  those are some of the ones i have heard...and so far i'm carrying low and the babys heart beat is a little slower i think around 5 beats under per minute than the "normal" average...so it points to a girl...but i still think i'm having a boy!|`|Axle82kMaa	i thought it was low boy high girl..|`|Y1Lb5f4Eaa	After I got pregnant I studied all those old wives tales and they all said I was having a girl. The Chinese calender said I was having a girl. All my friends said I was having a girl because of how I looked, how I said I felt, etc. I dreamt every night I was having a girl.  Well, guess what? He's definitely not a girl. :) I wouldn't put much stock in that.<br>  Congrats and let us know what you're having later?|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I have news for you, it's the sperm that determines the sex of your child. So from the second the egg is fertilized the sex is already 'chosen'. If the sperm contains an X chromosome then you'll get a girl. If it's a Y then you'll get a boy. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of arguments that female sperm lasts longer than male sperm and that therefore depositing the sperm closer to the entrance of the vagina than the cervix will give you a greater chance of the male sperm dying off first... But it's not a proven method. <br>  Given that you're already pregnant it doesn't matter WHAT you do from here on out, it's either a girl or a boy and that's the end of it.<br>  <br>  Congratulations though, and I hope you get what you're hoping for :D|`|5ItOGyVHaa	the gender is carried by the sperm. there are little girl swimmers and little boy swimmers. <br>  <br>  boy swimmers are faster and use up most of their Energy trying to get to the egg as it is a long way for them. but they die fast. so if the egg is not there yet you will have a higher chance of having a girl. because little girl swimmers take their time getting to the egg and there for can sit around 5 days waiting for it to arrive. <br>  <br>  the girls arrive about the time the boys are dieing.|`|tMeN2fm0aa	I have seen on WebMD about how to make it a boy or girl while having sex.  But when you are already pregnant I heard that there is a vitamin you can take to help with a girl... not sure about a boy.  Congrads on your pregnancy!|`|x1qKGmzSaa	ive only heard, if (when ur showing) if its higher its a boy, lower a girl. close to Venus has a penis. lol<br>   but i dont know if theres any truth to that.<br>  <br>  :)|`|LeQiljr7aa	If you are carrying low then its probably a girl
zPYyGw8oaa	Walking, swimming, yoga, aerobics...just dont get over-heated and take it easy in the beginning/end. make sure you eat well and take your vitamins :)|`|yNoENquTaa	when exercising the aim is to not push yourself during pregnancy. swimming is excellent for this. yu can just do simple stretches at home and work on your pelvic floor muscles also. yoga is ok to. just let your instructor know you are pregnant so they can give you suitable exercises. you can google pregnancy exercises to or talk to your doctor about it. also walking is good too.
SJx9IWWtaa	How much less is a lot?  And can you even afford to come up with the extra $?<br>  <br>  If he is handy, and might be able to fix any other problems that could happen.  I would opt to fix the old one and save ANY money I could.  <br>  <br>  If its starting to have more problems on top of the already broken motor, then if I could, I would save for the new one.  Because I would hate to spend that type of money on motor and then something else drastic go wrong with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Sounds like a horrible situation.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	To be honest I do not know what a ute is.  But I will attempt an answer anyways.  I would say it would depend on what the product is and the difference in the life expectancy of the product old versus new.  For example, my grandfather had a refrigerator for 50 years because they made them soo well back in his day they didn't need to be fixed, now you are lucky if they last a couple years... so it depends on the type of product and the lifetime warranty/expectancy of the new products.
IAllZ5bLaa	My sister had breast augmentation roughly a year before she got pregnant. She did not have any pain during and after her pregnancy that she spoke of (and she would have if she did, she's just wonderful like that :D) As far as the looks (I don't think its very vain at all) her natural breast fattiness grew, she kept the skin moist so she didn't get any stretch marks. When the went down in size they looked the same to me, it didn't shift the augmentation at all. Her augmentation didn't have the nipple moved either, if that matters to you.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, hope this was helpful to you, and take care!|`|c5AJGcYcaa	My sister in law had implants when she was prego with my nephew, and as far as i know she had no problems. She did get some more stretch marks and they didn't look at "pretty" as they did before but not to the point of her wanting to get them re-done.<br>  <br>  She breastfed my nephew too, til he was 8 months old. <br>  <br>  I guess it will all just depend on your situation and your weight gain and how much milk your breasts hold
lmk3mKJgaa	I started depo in september of 04 and came off it in december of 05 and started the pill then and in may of 06 the dr took me off the pill and then i got pregnant in september of 06. I know they say it takes up to 5 years to become pregnant but it depends on you and your body. best of luck!!|`|C1spuRsZaa	Been on Depo for 3 months now....haven't gotten pregnant yet...|`|duinadV4aa	i was on the depo shot for 6yrs and it took me a year to conceive|`|1o820L3Daa	I got pregnant on the depro, Id had an infection and was taking antibiotics. I didn't actually find out I was pregnant till I was 15 weeks, as I wasn't having regular periods. My daughter is now 6 years old, and Im pregnant with my second after stopping my depro for just 3 months.
S0RvtkZjaa	My man handled it the same way, although I wouldn't quite say my man- I would say "MY BOY" lol. He is so lazy, he literally plays XBOX all day, he is going through school but only twice a week, he has no job and even though im 23 weeks pregnant he told me I should consider getting another job! He spends all of his money on games, asks his mom for money, and he doesnt even drive his MOM drives him everywhere.. Its really ridiculous.. I regret having a child with THIS boy, but he will atleast be good to our baby hopefully and hopefully yours will too. Maybe he's a little nervous about becoming a father, and when he is around you its a constant reminder that- hey shes really pregnant. EVerytime I take my shirt off around my BF he stares at my stomach like its some walking virus, and he doesn't even want to feel the baby kick! <br>  <br>  Remember this- A women becomes a mother when she gets pregnant, but a man becomes a father when he holds his child for the first time.<br>  <br>  - He doesn't have a strong connection, like you and your baby do, and he will man up sooner or later! I do not think you should kick him out, because stress is harmful for you and your little one! Right now, you need to focus on that little bundle in  there, and tell your bf, "Babe, I need you to take more responsibility this stress is not good for the baby,", or "Maybe we should spend more time together". <br>  <br>  Guys need constant reminders because there a little slower at grasping women's feelings sometimes! haha :)|`|Fd4lITkvaa	He won't grow up until you demand it and even then he may decide that he doesn't want to. Don't ever ask him for help, tell him what you need from him. Take his name off of the credit cards if you need to. He is a grown man and should be able to pay for himself and soon you and a baby.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	He's mooching off you.  What are you  (and him) going to do for money when you have to leave work to care for the baby.  Tell him to grow up, take responsibility, get a job or GET OUT!!!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Wow honey. You've got yourself in a pickle,and not the pregnancy. This "man" you're with. He sounds horrible, irresponsible and laaazy! Why do you put up with it? He doesn't treat you anywhere near what you deserve. You're carrying his child and he doesn't have the decency to look for a job or grow up at all. He's going to be a father within months,and he's not ready.|`|duinadV4aa	sounds like you already have your mind made up you'll get tired of being sick in tired of getting put on the back burner you have to come first not second until the baby gets there good luck|`|DDnxY3k1aa	well i swear i got pregnant.. and i notice my belly growing more and me at a slow rate.. it's getting more pregnant.. i'm telling him.. look.. my belly is round like this.. and that and that... and today since people haven't been believing my pics i took a while ago on here, i decided to take me to the shower wall and see if i look round and how much if it looks pregnant or not and it does look pregnant! i layed down but i wasn't on my boobs or belly much after i lyed for a while my belly burnt so i got up and i feel blood pumping funny. well... he's still doing porn... he don't care of my feelings but he does love me... i want his kid so bad. he says he wants me to be the mother of his kids. i can't wait to have kids with him.|`|KYdg8tpUaa	Holy cow! There is no way i would date,have sex,definetly not marry a man with his lack of motivation! That is ridiculous you need to put your foot down and get him off his butt..or move on! He number one should not be lounging around while you are out bringing home the bacon for TWO years by yourself. It is one thing if you make a good living and he works and doesn't make the same..but the fact is that he should be contributing something too.. what is his future plan? Is he going to be a stay at home dad, since he doesn't want to work appareantly? Is that ok with you if he does? Will you be able to afford that if he does? These are all things you need to sit down with him and talk about. He is not going to take control of the situation until he decides he wants to..you should definetly start out by sitting him down and talking to him about how you feel..And he shouldn't be going out all night partying it up with his friends..sounds like he is just all around immature and in no position to be the husband and father that you need him to be..but hes never gonna stop as long as you are letting him do these things..|`|2zC1lpfVaa	I think he will never turn the corner... And I think that, now that you are pregnant with his child, it would be even harder to kick him out.  I am sorry, but he seems the type that only knows how to take advantage of other people, and how to live of other people.  For sure later he will use his paternity right as a way for you to keep feeding him.|`|LeQiljr7aa	He sounds very selfish and imiture. But you sound like a smart girl so there must be something about him thats good enough to have a child with. But now its time to not only think about whats good for you, but whats good for the little life inside you.|`|52U22fiAaa	Your husband sounds like a mooch.  It seems like you are caring for one child already...HIM!  <br>  <br>  I don't know how you're doing it, but I think you'd be better off on your own.|`|AA10967880	well now you have a child to consider. is this what you want your child to grow up to look up to? do you want your child to cry themselves to sleep because daddy didnt make it to their football game? you have to think about raising a child and what is best for them. my mother left her first husband left a house and moved into a 2 bedroom place with a 3 and 5 year old because it was right for the children. no matter what.<br>  <br>  <br>  i have to move now that im pregnant. i have to rehome my birds which is goin to break my heart because i need a bigger place for my bub and i have to sacrafic what i love for it. <br>  <br>  you need a serious talk with him get your mother in on it and have a serious sit down with him. tell him hes goin to be a father and this child comes first. he needs to pull his head in get a job or hes out. simple. either he takes care of the childs well being aswell or hes out. stress will cause trouble for you and your baby. <br>  <br>  he could mature but i doubt it 22 is still a very dumb age for males specially if hes been use to gettin it all his own way. ive seen males who are 30 and still dont live up to their responcibilties. you need to fix it and you need to do it now. you make him make the decision. either he steps up to the plate and bes a man and takes care of the child or he can run away like a lil boy to his mates place. but onces hes out that door its for good.<br>  <br>  you do what is right for the child unfortuantly some times it breaks your heart but you know its the right think. remember he has to make the decision give him is options and make him decide.<br>  <br>  my hubby is 26 at that age he wanted a child but i had to mature first im 24 now and happy to be a mummy to be, and ive been growing realyl quick since finding out.|`|Axle82kMaa	I would of kicked his *** out a long time ago! <br>  <br>  But I'm sure my husband thinks the same of me. (I just now got a job and hes the bread winner and pays all our bills)<br>  <br>  I told my husband thanks giving day that I KNEW I was pregnant. I could just tell. He was pissed! He kept saying over and over you better not be pregnant you better not be pregnant. He made me take a test that night. Took a digital and the beautiful words "positive" came up. He didn't believe it and made me take the other one took. and again, "positive" came up. We were out of town staying with his parents for the holidays. He grabbed the test looking pissssssed and ran out to show his mom. Surprisingly enough he was very very happy. Now when I tell him it kicks, etc he act like he doesn't care and it really hurts. All he does is drink and say he's depressed. I have an U/S friday so I'm hoping he'll straighten up after he sees it for the first time in real time.<br>  <br>  I'm not much help, Sorry!<br>  <br>  Do what you feel is right!|`|gWiZAsfBaa	During my pregnancy, I was disappointed in my husband's lack of interest with the baby. The only time he was somewhat interested was when we picked out names. We were both in college at the time. It was his last semester, so he was really busy with school, a part-time job, graduation and my constant nagging. He hardly spent any time out with his friends. As my due date drew closer, he started to help me out more. He helped me put on my shoes, give me foot and back massages. If I wanted to eat something, he would go out and buy it for me. He even did the laundry!<br>  <br>  After I had our son, my husband was really attentive. He cooked for me, massaged my feet, helped bathe our son, feed him. He helped me pump and washed bottles. He pretty much took over the things that I used to do. We set up a routine where I would take care of our son during the night so my husband could rest and go to class. During the morning, he would watch our son when he gets back from class so I could rest.<br>  <br>  I hope your husband comes around soon. Being a father is a big responsibility. At his age, I would expect him to know it.  I wish you two the best of luck!|`|pxbs9Vbqaa	It sounds like your man is too young and needs to grow up some still...  It also sounds like he had it easy and if you want im to own up your going to have  a long road ahead of you. Doesnt it suck when your heart is telling you something your head isnt. I guess the best thing you can do right now is t sit and talk with him openly and honest about the situation. See if he starts to take some initiative in moving forward. If not you will have to do some serious thinking about how much you want to put you and your baby thru, why would he want to leave his pregnant wife at home? Shouldnt this be a joyful time in life. If the time comes to get rid of him, it sounds like there is a supportive grandma there to lend some loving help. Dont worry ( i knw easier said than done) Everything always works out in its way... Take care, but dont take crap from him|`|tMeN2fm0aa	Men mentally age slower than women, and you are right *hopefully* about not kicking him out.  Hopefully when the child comes he will straighten up and things will get better.  It honestly might take kicking him out after the baby comes and he seeing what he is missing out on for him to straighten up.  If you can handle this now, then I would say leave things be for now.  See if things get better.  Let him know how you feel and what you are thinking and that you need him to change.   See how he acts after the baby comes.  If he doesnt, then kick him out.  I bet he changes! Mine did!! If he doesnt, then you dont need that in your babies life anyways!   Think about it!  Do you want your child to think that is the way a person is to be???  Is that the example of a man you want set for you boy?  Or if its a girl, do you want that to be the example of a husband set for her???  Let things be, but be honest about the changes you wish for....  Hopefully things will get better!!!!!!
i2Ytn70Yaa	I find it astonishing...it makes me want to think about it all day long! But people may have trouble pronouncing it, or may even make fun of a child with that name...|`|Elxuvon8aa	well it reminds me of a nick name for happy tobaccy to be honest|`|e2muGSbpaa	I apologize, but i find it quite odd.|`|3ERx4opSaa	lol, i was born at hadassah hospital.<br>  <br>  good name for girl, not boy.|`|F2cVt5jaaa	Sorry..I kind of think of a terrorist :o(|`|AOkucu5haa	Too much going on|`|lJd5OET6aa	weird?|`|qpCvG566aa	my cousin's friend had a baby named hadassah and we all think it is weird it makes you think "fat" i dont know why but i never liked it|`|yDfbQOTjaa	fine if you are in a Jewish community, if your kid goes to public school they'll probably be teased a lot.|`|fKdCBsfQaa	Well..im not a fan of the name itself but you could call (if its a girl) her Haddy(ie) which i like.|`|NPeKQBtTaa	What is the meaning? and origin?<br>  It sounds Arabic to me. Good name.
HF97Rs9qaa	you can get a lawyer and take her to court and they can court order it.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	You don't need to waste money on a lawyer/attorney.<br>  <br>  You need to go to court and file for a paternity test.They will more than likely require her to comply with the order.If the child is yours, you can then file for visitation or joint custody.If you are a "fit" parent, you will be granted visitation or joint custody.You should also file for child support too so you can help support the child and don't screw yourself.<br>  <br>  Make sure you do this as soon as possible because every month that goes by, is one months worth of child support that she can go after you for backed support.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rFwGnZIJaa	I believe you can get a court order for one. See if you can get a free consultation with a lawyer or look up the laws in your state. I'm not a hundred percent sure but it's worth a try. And thank you for being a man and realizing your duty. I'm sorry though that your ex seems to be too immature on what she is missing even if there might have been bad stuff between you.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Congrats on wanting to man up :)<br>  But you can't exactly force her to allow a DNA test but you can do it legally. Speak to an attorney and file a petition.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|vWY0vEyqaa	Just tell her that you'll help contribute to the costs of the baby's upbringing. Nappies etc are EXPENSIVE so she should come round|`|QR6IHIZxaa	take her to court and they'll make her get the test|`|UzORRjUXaa	If she takes u for child support. Tell the judge or hearing officer that there is a possibility this is not your child. Don't sign that birth certificate until you know for certain. Or you can buy one of them Dna home test and swap yourself and the child and they will mail you the results...Or you can go on Maury......|`|2TihZnvAaa	If you think the baby could be yours hire an attorney and go to court.  You have the right to know if the baby is your and you will definitely be granted a DNA test.
YFPMcHCbaa	If you think you're pregnant, take a test! It won't hurt you.
IU4uNH97aa	i wouldn't because even now at such a young age i see them grow more into their names each day. But saying that when my 3rd child was born i never quite thought that he looked like a Jude although i loved the name it didn't seem perfect to me like the other kids' names were to them but in a couple months time and his personality starting coming out I could have never pictured a better name for him. <br>  <br>  My kids are :<br>  Lucy August <br>  Sebastian Ripley<br>  Jude Michael River<br>  Bishop Oliver goes by Oliver though<br>  and I'm currently pregnant with another one which the name is undecided.<br>  <br>  I the only real regret that i sometimes have is with my youngest son Bishop Oliver, it is more on the unique side of names and there is always that fear of him being teased and then he always has to say that he wants to go by Oliver instead so yeah sometimes i do wish we named him Oliver Bishop or he would have a different middle name. Truly though Bishop was a name that meant a lot to my husbands side of the family and I'm happy was able to give this to them. Over all now i still wouldn't change his name and i hope when he grows up he loves it for the meaning it had to his dad. Plus i couldn't imagine naming him something else he looks so much like a Bishop Oliver its incredible.<br>  <br>  With the other kids' names i think we did an pretty awesome job. They all sound good with our last name and will age with them very well. My husband likes unique more different names so we gave them to it as middle names. I don't think it will cause that much of a problem to them in life later on so I'm very happy with the names i chose for them, they all have meaning to us.|`|wLzuCDmfaa	I have four girls, a set of twins, both 5, and two girls, 3 and 9. Their names are Jainalee Nichole Elle, Nicolette Marie Elle (the twins), Ashley Emma Lynn and Macy Lee Alice. I love all of their names. Maybe I would change Macy's middle name to Mae or Jade. I have a friend who was drunk when she picked out her names, she picked out Edna Louise and Edison Lee (She had twins), her daughter wants her name changed to Isalynn. Her son wants his changed to James. They absolutely HATE their names, so the girl goes by Ellie and the boy goes by Jack (I have no idea where he got that.) She has legally changed the kids names to Isabella and Issac and they are now happy. The girl goes by Izzy and the boy goes by Issac. My kids, Janie, Nikki, Ashley and Macy, want to change their names, except Ashley, who just turned 3 and barely even knows her name. Janie wants her name to be Rainbow Sunshine, Nikki wants hers to be Kitty Smiles and Macy wants hers to be Marie Claire. My other friend, Ashley (I named Ashley after her), named her five kids, (four girls and a boy), Alex Lee, Emma Riley, Elle Jade, Rachel Rae and lastly Samantha Alexandra. Her kids love their names, except Samantha who wants her name to be shorter. Just to annoy her mom she wants her name to be Flo or An.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	My son's name is Maddox Michael and his nickname is Max, and no i wouldn't change his name for anything lol, it suits him perfectly.<br>  Yea i think he does like his name, esp. his nickname Max (which he loves to say lol), but not sure if he likes Maddox, but he is only 9 months old lol, so it may be awhile til i know for sure what he thinks, although he is super smart for his age.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|WKxi3gWBaa	I named my daughter Kyra Elise Isobella Sounds funny until you say the lastname and it all fits together just right but ill leave that off here. I love the name isobella and wanted that to be her first name. my husband didnt cause he thought id call her izzy... (i woulda) and so i tossed that in and we came to Kyra and Elise.. two names we both really like.. i love her name its beautiful to me and she is a beautiful girl.. mean though lol i wouldnt change it for the world! shes only 4 months shy of 2 though so as of now.. i think she likes her name lol she calls herself Ky Ky. If anything i would have spelled her name better.... someonething more unique... like... Kighra ... her name is NOT KEER -a... most think it is and its KY .. like... Ky-le.. Or Ky-lee...  or Ky Rah.. lol|`|CAc7zMkgaa	My daughter is called Marlowe. She was named after Christopher Marlowe...and because I wanted a little girl I could call Lo. I still love her name, but sometimes I regret it. People look at me funny and go "That's an interesting name" when I introduce her. She doesn't seem to mind, although a little boy in her preschool class has taken to calling her marshmarlowe. I don't know. I'm not sure I would change it.|`|F2cVt5jaaa	My daughter's name is Zo? Ryan<br>  I would NEVER change it :o)<br>  I do however hate how popular Zo? is getting. But if you see my daughter's spelling is more unique..so at least I have that!|`|Elxuvon8aa	I think instead of naming my daughter Merry Kay I would have gone with Meredeth Kathrine I do not know why but I do like the double letters in her name it became a tradition|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Gary Dean and Thomas Brian......When I had them just about everyone used traditional names.  If I had them now I would name them something different but not back then.  They never said anything about their names one way or the other so I guess it's fine w/them.|`|23d4e5541c3e44e5449602e6ac5d7671aa	Knowing what I know now about life - yes, I would absolutely change their names. I gave my oldest son a "unique" name. Totally wish I didn't now. My youngest has a slightly different name, but not as much as my older one. People really have no idea what they are setting their kids up for in the real world as adults when they give them these "unique" names. I hope they are able to use their middle names if they should have trouble with their first - later on down the road in a professional sense.<br>  <br>  I think quite a bit different at 30 now than I did at 20.|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	I would not change anything. Ok maybe I would have went ahead and gave my son 2 middle names like I did my girls. My babies names are Autumn Jessalynn Faith- her dad picked out Autumn, and now that she has gotten older it is perfect for her she looks like the perfect description of a child in autumn.Jessalynn came from my mother and sister's name, adn Faith is something Ichose beacuse I was told several times that I would not be able to have children and faith is what brought her to us. My middle chil's name is Abagail Misty Renae. I have always loved athe name Abagail so I knew she would have to have that name, plus I wanted to keep the whole A thing. Misty is from a great friend of mine that was killed while I was pregnant with her so I knew that was a must, and Renae is from my sister. This way both of my girls are named after their aunt.*I also chose to spell her first name a lil different! My son is named Jaycob Elijah, spelled different again. I wanted to somehow add my husband's brother's name in my son's name but my husband wouldn't go for it. I felt as if my girls were named after their aunt it would only be fair for him to be named after his uncle. Jaycob was chose beacse my husband's name is James, and he is the 3rd, so I couldn't use it, and it means the same thing, adn Elijah is from an uncle of his that was very important to him and had passed away!So their you go my babies names and why. Do you have children?|`|hgPmwYAfaa	...my children...Michelledion and Michaeltravis...still have their birth names after...30 years...although one of them changed it slighlty and the girl's name....the ending may change with  marriage but, I have always liked them and never wanted to change them|`|CMuL7XpKaa	i have no kids
woEoXfaZaa	It is very normal to have a large increase in extra discharge during pregnancy.  It should be white or creamy.  It may become even more increased later - so many woman wear a panty liners to prevent it leaking on to underwear.  <br>  <br>  Keep your genitals clean and dry and avoid tight clothing, deodorants, soaps, bubble baths and perfumes. If the discharge turns yellowish, greenish or very thick, notify your doctor immediately.|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	It may be a increase in vaginal discharge due to increased blood flow to the area. It should be clear or kinda whiteish but if it has a smell or a weird color go to the hospital asap, but also check with your doc about it.|`|F7knBX1haa	Yes I had this throughout my pregnancy and I curently pregnant. Unless there is blood coming out, then I would not worry. This is normal.|`|6wGkycFAaa	I didn't but I have heard of fluid leaking from the uterus. I would strongly urge you to see your doctor in the morning. If you are unable to get in to him/her, then go to the hospital. There is a lot of fluid but if this has been going on for a few days, baby could be at risk. Please, see someone right away. Good luck and good health.

c5AJGcYcaa	During most normal pregnancies, you should have at least two (2). One between 20 and 22 weeks, that one is a long ultrasound where they check all the development of you baby. This is also where they determine the sex of your little bundle. Then usually the doc will order one (1) more around 36 weeks to make sure that your baby has flipped into head down position.<br>  If you are really concerned about this (which i can understand you fears if there are genetic heart birth defects in your family) then i saw get a second (2nd) opinion from another doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helped|`|ZQX4fjfdaa	During my last pregnancy I had two ultrasounds.....1 was around 9 weeks during my first visit just to determine i was pregnant and how far along.   my second was around 20 weeks and thats when they determined the sex of the baby and when they also look for any abnormalties. Some people have more if there is a problem detected it all depends on the pregnancy.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	I think you're supposed to have 3 ultrasounds through out the entire pregnancy. One to make sure your the right amount of weeks, i had one at 7 weeks to make sure then at 18 weeks, that's when i found out that i was having a girl, then one later on around 37 weeks to see if the baby is head down... i think that's the normal thing...<br>  i had 13 ultrasounds because i had a high risk pregnancy and doctors discovered my baby wasn't growing properly...i had all those normals ones and all the other 10 were between 33-38 weeks. My insurance covered them all. If your doctor request more than those average 3 then you will get them, let him know your concerns.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Usually if all goes well you only have one at around 19weeks<br>  <br>  Some people have eaerly ultrasounds if the have bleeding or previous miscarriages etc.<br>  <br>  If they find something on the ultrasound that needs to be monitored they will do further ultrasouns - but they dont like to do too many as the small amount of radiation does add up.<br>  <br>  I f i was you, i wouold ask the Dr again, considering your family history|`|436fREgIaa	Most insurances only cover 2 through the entire process.<br>  <br>  unless there is something they detect wrong with the baby,that is most likely all you will have.usually they can see the heart,but not the chambers at the first ultrasound.if the heart rate was good,you have nothing to worry about.remind them at your next ultrasound,your concerns that you would like them to check the heart.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	usually 3 ultrasounds.... a dating ultrasound in the first trimester... Nucal Fold Ultrasound in the 2nd trimester and your 20 week ultrasound. Well im from NewZealand and thats whats done here. All the best :)|`|uE0jhj9Qaa	I had two with mine. Both kids One at 10 wks and one at 16 wks Im thinking! MAybe at 20 I cant remember for sure.|`|oRaYQNXxaa	I had sonograms at 6 weeks (it was a threatened eptopic preg, turns out everything was fine though)<br>  -8 weeks just to make sure she was growing correctly and all<br>  -19 weeks (our insurance company required this ultrasound here on post...husband is military)<br>  -26 weeks, I was in a car wreck and they were afraid I was bleeding in my uterus...I wasn't though. Found out we are having a girl :)<br>  -29 weeks just to make sure the doctors office had an updated ultrasound of her<br>  <br>  Everyone is different. But if you have complications and all then chances are you will get more than two ultrasounds. But I think generally you are supposed to get 2-3 during your pregnancy.
kGkUG0fKaa	you should charge for the time the child is alseep becaus eyou are still watching the child. so don't cheat yourself on that note.<br>  <br>  I used to charge depending on how long I would have to keep the child and I normally charged a flat rate by day and not hour. for the weekend, a full 3 days, I charged $60 a day and that was if i had to stay the night. I felt it would have been too expensive to charge but the hour for three days and wanted to give a fair and reasonable price. <br>  <br>  but that was me...|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I would charge a flat rate of 50 dollars.  Thats how much I get paid for an 8 hour job.  <br>  Hope This Helps<br>  <br>  =]
wOLoYW7jaa	After my daughter turned 1 we slowly started getting her off the bottle...we first replaced her daytime bottles with sippy cups that resembled her bottles, then the daytime cups of whatever character she liked the best - slowly we would offer her the sippy cup at night and if she didnt want it, we would have a bottle standing by...each night we tried a little harder to get her to take the sippy cup and eventually she forgot all about the bottles - so take your time and do what works best for you and your son -- taking a few more weeks/months isnt going to hurt his teeth forever - just dont let it sit there.  My daughter is now 29 months old and still has a sippy cup of milk before bed....|`|hieQHR0daa	It's not formula or milk in a bottle that is so damaging to teeth. Some mums put juice, tomato soup, chocolate drinks, tea with milk and sugar and a whole variety of things in bottles.  Later the front of the child's mouth has a circle of dental decay.<br>  If your son wants to hang on to this for now that's fine. Limit it to milk and there is less chance of tooth damage.|`|umhjqZwLaa	your doctor sould be able to answer this for you. the baby should be on formula for 1 year if you don't breast feed. then on cow milk until 18 months old.as a father of 2 . experience tells me to give the baby the bottle. my boy's teeth are fine.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	he'll cry for a bit but just take the bottles away cold turkey...he'll be fine in a day or two with just his sippy cups...and yes laying a child down for bed with milk can cause havoc with his teeth.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	The sooner you get him off the bottle the better it will be and easier too. It wont take longer then two-four days and he will totally forget about it. But when you do it stick to your guns and throw them all away, if he is thirty he will drink even if its out of a sippy or a reg. glass. Trust me he isnt going to let himself go thirsty bc you threw out the bottles. It does mess up their teeth and like I said the faster you do it and just get it over with the better it will be in the long run. Good luck|`|Vqqc54oNaa	I've looked into this too. my daughters is 3 weeks into her 1st year and i hear its okay for them to have it until there13mos.- 15 mos. at the latest. so maybe just try to ween him off slowly so its not a slap in his face. and i also heard that for the teeth the only bad thing is the milk sitting on there teeth all nite, just make sure to brush his teeth (i'm just guessing he has some) twice a day. Good luck.|`|uCqT14VIaa	id have to agree with julie. my daughter is 2 and a half and she still takes 1 bottle at nap and one at night. for some reason i cant knock those ones out. and im not going to let her sit there and cry for hours. but she has great teeth not ever one problem. alot of people may have a lot to say about it, but you are his mommy do what you think is best.|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	I had a bottle when I was a baby... I had to have a lot of dental work done because the juice would sit on my teeth while I was sleeping.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	My son is almost 16 months, and we are now starting to try and cut out the bottles. <br>  I would say not to worry about it just yet. You brush his teeth right? I know how hard it is to deny your little man, and in my opinion, he is still a baby. Babies have bottles! <br>  Soon you should start trying to take the bottles away. Like maybe start working on it now, so that by 16 months it won't be so hard. I seriously wouldn't judge a person giving thier older babies bottles, I can imagine it won't be easy getting my son off them.<br>  Hopefully :)<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your little boy!|`|KRQtXHwIaa	I am going to get so many thumbs down lol but here it goes. Every single one of mine had a bottle until they were two years old.  They only got them at nap time and bed time. They were not allowed to have a full bottle all night or all during nap time just one to soothe them to sleep and that was it.  If you let them suck on it all night then yes of course it is bad for their teeth, but what is the difference between putting them to bed with a sippy cup (especially if it is one of those Nuby ones) or a bottle.  None of my kids has ever even had a cavity. It didn't hurt them one tiny bit. This is just my opinion, but at 1 year olds they are still babies! I know many moms who nurse to 2 years or more because they feel like their children need that well I felt like mine still needed their bottles. Good luck to you, you know what is best for your child :)|`|af96mcl1aa	My son was the same way about his bottle when it was time to give it up. Its his comfort thing. One night I just decided to wean him off of bottles for good, and get him started on the sippy cups. He was upset that whole night and cried for about an hour or so, then finally took the cup. I just cut him off the bottles cold turkey and it worked wonderfully for me. My son is incredibly mellow so i think that had alot to do with how smoothly the process went. Good luck to you on that. You both will get through it with time!<br>  <br>  <br>  Also I give my son his sippy cup of milk when he goes down for the night, and after he's been asleep for a while I'll go in and rinse it out and fill it with water. So when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he'll drink the water and rinse off his teeth in the process. Its worked beautifully for the past 4 months with no teeth problems what-so-ever.|`|lDqn5KICaa	Give that boy his bottle. He'll be fine. Sounds like he's not ready to ween from it yet. My daughter gave it up at 17 months when we went on a trip and "forgot" to bring bottles. As long as the bottle is not in the crib with him all night (and for God's sake, not full of juice), it's a very soothing thing to have before sleep. People who say that it's crucial to stop at exactly a year are silly. Who decided that? Doctors? What was their advice ten years ago? What will it be in ten years?
ot0TqzSvaa	K-eye <br>  (rymes with die or lie)<br>  Its kinda like Kite without the 't' i guess.<br>  <br>  It is definately one of my favourite Boys names.. <br>  Sounds a bit strange for a girl, but that might just be because im so used to it on a boy.<br>  <br>  As a boys name, i think its really cool and trendy; not too common; not too hard to pronounce or spell, and generally a really good name. 10/10!<br>  <br>  ? Bee|`|r2gonS44aa	Looks like the name "Mai"  which sounds like "my" (my house, my car)  --> I would only assume then that this name sounds like that but with a 'K'   So "Ky"<br>  <br>  Rhyming with sky, lie, "My o' my", pizza pie, my, try, blahblahblah...<br>  <br>  I would consider this a girls name, and a very unique name at that.

AA11303010	Yours is a firsthand account of the decline of society. Sad but true. It starts in the home. Parents stop caring, stop being involved. And then the ripple effect-these kids learn how NOT to parent and pass this poor parenting on to their kids. It's a sad cycle.<br>  Keep being a good mom. You will see later when you have raised amazing adults, and these other kids grow up committing crimes, not valuing the home and family-everything good or bad, starts in the home. It's a slippery slope, this lack of personal responsibility that is plaguing America, and we are passing this laziness and lack of responsibility and pride in one's self on to our kids. Some kids will rise above (I can speak from experience on that) but what real chance of decency are these lazy parents giving their kids? Not much. And I was a single mom for years and my kids have NEVER been in such a situation. You can be single and still be a caring parent|`|LJDiSCCNaa	Some parents don't feel anything at all. Some are at home getting high,smoking meth, getting beaten by the baby's daddy...etc. <br>  <br>  Try not to judge too harshly when you don't have all the facts. I feel really sad for those children you spoke of.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	umm, yeah, it's the neighborhood. try moving.|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	damn what kind of ghetto park did u go to?<br>  <br>  So irresponsible of the parents.

And so do they.|`|NmLMUOkXaa	My boyfriend and I were coming home one night about 10:30 and there was a little girl walking in the middle of the road who couldn't have been more than 7. Not only would we have hit her if we hadn't been paying close attention, we also don't live in the best neighborhood. Of course we pulled over and asked her if she needed help finding her parents, she wouldn't answer us so her parents or school had obviously taught her not to talk to strangers, but that wouldn't have kept someone from just picking this child up never to be heard from again. We called the police and I can only hope these parents got a wake up call. Seriously, some people should have to pass a competency test to have children.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Because:<br>  1) Their kids were mistakes that they never wanted to be responsible for raising to begin with.<br>  2) Because they are too lazy to meet the minimum requirements of the term "supervise".<br>  3) Because they are "too busy" to bother with teaching their kids some decency, manners, self respect, and boundaries.<br>  3) Because SOOOO many people tell ones like myself to "shut up and mind my own business"....so it is now normal for kids to run like wild animals.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I swear when parents take their kid to the playground its like a break for them which is stupid...they need to be watching them in public maaking sure they are considering others...i think its a good opportunity to teach that.  I get damn frustrated too at some of the brats running around.  You know whats the WORST?  Those damn shoes that are skates....i've had like 100 kids bump into me on those things and parents dont seem to care. I feel like rolling them into a wall sometimes...|`|iLLoc003aa	I would have called the cops telling them that I was at the park with my children and there are young children there unsupervised, with no shoes on and it was getting late and that I was concerned with their well being...cops would of scared those parents straight or gotten the kids some better attention.|`|xxS74ZsMaa	its called bad parenting..i agree...i think its absolutely annoying when parents don't supervise there kids..at mardi gras...they had this little boy hitting other children with a bull wip...why the hell would a parent let there child carry around a bull wip...these parents need to be better parents before something bad happens to there child.|`|nfb6VTK5aa	Some parents are retarted. Also don't you think they would of escaped or something come one they were barefoot and with their bikes.|`|Z0PqY7soaa	oh yeah i agree.<br>  where are parents these days?|`|T9fek24eaa	LAZY PARENTING! there are about 2 people in my neighborhood that do this. Their kids are always out in middle of the road and they can not be older than 2 or 3. I hate it when I see this stuff! I know back when I was little, letting your kids run around and ride their bikes in the street, was not a big deal, but I lived in a very small rural community and that was a different time. I seriously can not even imagine letting my kids ride their bikes in the road with out me trailing behind them when they are like 10! I dont get it either...|`|ngkNaQJeaa	it breaks my heart that alot of parents are so negligent,<br>  but what can we do?<br>  all we can do is be the best parents we can be with our own children.<br>  It is so sad to see examples of bad parenting. it's frustrating!<br>  I once lost my cool and rolled down the window in a parking lot and yelled out to a mother to put a hat on her little baby because of how cold it was outside, then you see those dumb and clueless parents who's kids are always sick, have snot running down their face, and have ear infections.<br>  alot of parents don't know how to keep their children nice and warm|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	those kids dont really have parents ..just birthers|`|2Hot9EJiaa	When I would take my 2 children to the park with friends, I was the only parent that seemed to watch them constantly.  All the other parents at least were there though.  I cannot understand how parents can let their young children go be alone at a park, or outside.  My children were not anywhere by themselves at such a young age. Parents seem to be asking for trouble these days.  My parents were even more strict than I was with my 2, they are now 17 and 20.  However, as I look back, I am very thankful that my parents loved me enough to care about where I was and what I was doing, and my children, were thankful I cared enough too.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	It is very very sad, I see it too. People are uneducated and unmotivated about raising their kids, and I cannot think of anything I would rather succeed at. Society as a whole pays the price. It is very sad. If you see this on multiple occasions and you know where these kids live, I would not hesitate to call CPS and let them investigate. You may be doing them a great favor.|`|AA10953561	I'm in agreement with you on most of this. I wouldn't bother trying to stop other people's kids from running up slides or jumping off them. Naturally if I saw them doing something extremely dangerous I would say something, but if there weren't any parents around I would simply call child services. <br>  <br>  I get so frustrated and angry when I see people letting their small children run free in parking lots. I used to drive a big Expedition and if it weren't for my brother being with me and seeing a little girl run behind my Expedition when I was backing up I'm sure I would have run her over. People have kids but don't do the necessary things like playing with them, reading to them, or even keeping them properly clothed  It's like they think kids should be able to raise themselves.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	WOW 5 is a bit young, but I know  I was running around when I was younger, maybe about 3rd grade.  I think it depends on certain areas.  Granted you situation sounds way worse  than when I was a kid.  <br>  <br>  I would ride my bike around town with friends, going to parks and what not until dark (or in some cases bed time, here in az 8 o'clock can come before the sun goes down).  But we never got into trouble, and always checked in with our parents every hour or so.  And they usually knew somewhat where we would be (at our school, the park, or a friends house).  But it was a group of us, and we knew most everyone around the neighborhood.  So it didn't seem like a big deal.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	the difference is you are not a single parent..i believe the stressed out mothers just send their kids off to go play and mom probably gets a breather..sucks but thats the reality of how some people lives are..how about where i live her in the bronx nyc..these kids play in the streets with cars and buses ..football in the middle of the streets with no adults around..i am so heartbroken when i see that. my son will NOT be playing with these neighborhood kids..if he want play time i will make play dates with  other kids at chuckycheese but not in the streets for now me and hubby will play with him.
ksWm9eCBaa	Not knowing how far along you are, I'd just say, "Can you give me ___ months of your life?  Do you love me enough to stay with me, trying to believe me, until this baby comes?  THEN, when it comes, we'll do a DNA test and I'll prove to you that it's Yours...I've never cheated on u!"<br>  If, on the other hand, you're both slanting towards a different route, and he's just trying to get out of any support of whatev you've decided...you may wanna consider ditching 'im...if he's trying to run now and WONT' stay by your side...well...it's up to you.  Only you can tell if he's has room to grow in this type (or any) relationship /w you!|`|L6U1joGAaa	I think what you need to tell him is " your far to insecure to be with right now. It is stressing me out too much which is not good for OUR baby. I will send you a copy of the paternal test results with your name on them and a court ordered request for child support as soon as OUR child is born." That outta get his attention.|`|zPxzBd3oaa	don't stress over it, it's bad for you and the baby, once you stop stressing so much, he'll have time to think things over once he's cooled off, don't argue with him about it anymore, if you're saying the truth you shouldn't have anything to worry about|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	He seems paranoid..|`|VB7RL0Jsaa	He's probably just getting nervous about the upcoming baby and freaking out like a typical guy... <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it. Just keep telling him its his. Finally if he keeps asking turn it on him and get mad at him for his continuous asking! It's kind of insulting and especially in your precious and emotional state he shouldn't be putting you through that!<br>  <br>  God bless and best of luck!|`|8ae9CGqcaa	I have no idea what you should say to him. He sounds a little unstable, and paranoid, which is unhealthy.  Just offer up a paternity test, if it really bothers him that much.<br>  It seems to me like you've said all you can. It's up to him now to grow up, and stop acting like a victim in this relationship.
VuUz8NgKaa	He just advanced a little faster than the others.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I do wish new moms would give up "normal".<br>  Children attain milestones at different rates.<br>  I've read things from new mothers who are convinced their children are damaged because they didn't meet this one, or that.<br>  <br>  Moms? Enjoy your babies now.<br>  All too soon they will be grown up....|`|DDnxY3k1aa	he seems to be normal. i think he can do it as he is willing. um... each child grows at different rates... so... i know u'd like to say ur son is way ahead of the rest and not below.. but it's neither. just u're not really able to see the other kids. they all got their own skills. your son is maybe trying to impress the female ones cuz little boys do... it's a way i guess. and so he's showing improvement as an individual. i never had a kid yet or been around a little boy for a long time enough but i think this is part be true.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Mostly it will happen like that when the parents sort of enforce it, ya know like not hold them all the time and etc. So then the child gets bored of being in one spot and will crawl and walk etc. My son was also doing all of that before he was a year old, but I had to stop holding him all day long lol|`|BRT2teSqaa	You don't have a baby book?

Statistically, no, but he's advanced for his age.  Look at it this way - he might be a prodigy!|`|WfMXn9hMaa	He just advanced a little faster than the other kids.  Totally normal.  Sounds like you've got your hands full!!
LrFiV2W7aa	It depends on the kid. Most stop by the age of 5. You can buy a mat-type-thing mattress protectors to put on their bed so they can wear underwear and you don't need to worry about them ruining their sheets every night (which might happen at first). Also, set a time where they are not allowed to drink after and make sure they go to the bathroom before they go to bed. Wearing underwear, for some kids, makes them more confident and well like a big kid. I am only 14, so I am doing it off my brothers and cousins. My youngest brother stopped when he was about 3 and my other one still sometimes pees the bed (age 9). My cousin, who is 4, only sometimes wears a Pull-Up to bed (only when she sleeps over someone else's house. It depends on the child, but try to start slowly getting them out of the habit of wearing diapers to bed.|`|233590b251f45be4c87301ea1aee7103aa	She was toilet trained at 28 months and she could stay dry all night since she was 16 months old and I could put underpants on her at night before I could during the day.  I don't believe in pull ups because they feel too similar to diapers and she would urinate in them, so I bought the good old fashioned cloth training pants and if she wet them she definitely knew she didn't want to have a wet bottom! The transition went very smoothly and she hasn't had any set backs as yet and she will be 3 in May! Good luck!|`|aQrURNqHaa	My 8 yr. old girl potty trained early, at 2 1/2.  She loved the idea of having undies with girly characters on them, even if she had to mind the 'special rule' (using the potty) that cam with the privilege.  She transitioned smoothly and only had accidents on days when she was tired/stressed.  My 6 yr. old boy was the opposite.  He was closer to four and refused to go until he was ready.  I also used Pull-Ups with him, but stressed over it for about a year. The wisest advice I received was from my father.  He told me to let him be, and that when he felt ready he would simply decide it was time.  And that is precisely what happened, he decided he was ready and transitioned from one day to the next.|`|ofx1a5pvaa	well, my son wore goodnites to bed until he was almost 4. Sometimes when he's at my parents house though, he wears them. He did fine. He wet the bed only a few times. Not as much as I thought he would. It was harder to potty train him then anything.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	my son was completely potty broke before his 2nd b day. i do put pull ups on him at night bc sometimes he will pee the bed. he is also a super heavy sleeper so he doesnt feel it when he has to go sometimes at night|`|lqlfIEjNaa	I was surprised at how easy it was for me. After 1 week of my daughter being potty trained I realized that she could stay dry all night. So when I noticed that, I just started putting underwear at nights also. She was fully potty trained at 28 months.

AA11404991	You obviously have a very special child.  Special in a good way. haha.  I would put him in one of those gifted schools.  Or let him skip like 3 grades.  Either way, don't let his intelligence go to waste.  Feed his desire to learn. True intelligence is such a rare thing these days.|`|02xxwMRBaa	wow. your lucky to have such an intelligent boy. <br>  all children have the ability to learn, some more than others.  <br>  maybe you can ask the teachers if its possible to skip him up a grade because you know it would be boring to be sitting in a class where you already learned everything that they are teaching. <br>  <br>  kids who are just like your son:<br>  <a href="http://www.yourbabycanread.com/ce-y-success.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourbabycanread.com/ce-y-succ...</a>|`|4a3082fdd27954f83d41c22c5367e1fdaa	Your kid is obviously very gifted, don't be scared by it. Be proud- your kid is going to go so far in life!<br>  I wish i was born like him haha =)|`|6ri7AYC1aa	You have a very gifted child. You should be proud.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	i guess a good sperm won the race|`|3p6fXiFpaa	Yes this is normal. My 5 year old brother can do the same. Depending on the schools how ever, certain children are taught at different levels. <br>  As far as the DVD, DVR ect, that just depends on how much the child is allowed near this(Keep in mind the child may run into something that you don't want them watching).<br>  Because my brother watches Deigo (child's show) he knows many animals names and things of that sort, even what types of dens/homes they live in, the noises the make, and the food they eat.They can also speak a little Spanish from watching this show and Chinese from another show.Depending on what the child likes he may also obsess over something (one brother loves trains and can name the different kinds, one can tell you what model and make any vehicle is) they become very knowledgeable in that area. (remember they are in their development stage)<br>  You may need to have him moved to a better school where he can grow and learn at his level with kids his age level, or if you intend to have him in the same area have him advanced in level. (This may mean that he needs to take summer school to catch up to the kids he will be in class with.) There is a possibility that he may not be able to relate with the other kids due to age difference though.|`|d3WiJVk6aa	I think it's perfectly normal.  Every child is different, and will do different things at different times.  <br>  <br>  Support him to explore the world around him, and if you find he's interested in something make new material and experiences available to him.  You may want to consider different schooling options for him if the school is not able to keep him interested.  You don't want him to be forced to wait around for his classmates to catch up to him.  Read up on homeschool and unschool if you want some interesting ideas about supporting his education (even if you are not willing/able to homeschool, you may find information and support to help you address his specific needs).  <br>  <br>  EDIT>>> Your son may enjoy "notebooking" (whether he's in public, private, or homeschool) <a href="http://www.notebookingpages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notebookingpages.com/</a><br>  <br>  A couple of days ago I was talking to my neighbor, who is a substitute teacher at the local elementary school, and she told me of a boy in Kindergarten who is very advanced for his age, and the school decided that while he knows as much as a beginning first grader, he was not emotionally ready for a first grade classroom.  While I agree with the school's choice not to put him in first grade, I was shocked by the solution they have to teach him.  They keep him in with the other kindergarteners, but the teacher gives him "hard" homework to work on at home with his mom.  I would consider putting my child in a different school or keeping him out all together until he was emotionally ready for a first grade classroom in that situation.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	My 5 yo could read really well and would point out words too.  He is also a why kid.  I was told when he was really little that the best way to teach a kid is to let them ask as much as they want and to nurture that the best you know how.  So when he asks why, I answer, show him stuff on internet, til I"m bluein the face!  Honestly sometimes it gets kinda long winded, but it's for the best.  give him the right tools and continue working him!|`|LfD4ouKOaa	you have 1 smart kid. i barley even know my shapes and i'm in 6th grade! i don't think it is normal but i think he sure is special. he will be like an rocket scientist! WOW!|`|uAgBwWuSaa	hunny god has made him this way its a good thang to have many people dont have children this smart but keep up the good work|`|UNBMeY0taa	steroids|`|242b5f34bdd602320413b07dcbbd44c7aa	That sounds about average to me.  My oldest daughter could operate a TV and VCR together when we put them in her room at 18 months old.  Both of my older children could read at 3 years old, were in 5K, and could do addition and subtraction.  At 6 years old my son was in 3rd grade and reading on a 5th grade level.  My 17 month old daughter is hearing-impaired, but knows the letters of the alphabet, colors, and shapes.<br>  <br>  So yes, I'd say very normal for that age!|`|4E5yePkfaa	he is just wanting to learn everything he can! he is more advance or his age. but i have a cousin who will be 2 in april that can spell her name, sing songs to the tv shows she watches she is in school and she knows her alphabet without missing a letter and can count to 100 she talks to people etc and can dress her self she is extra smart but he just wants to be more active its not abnormal u should be happy that he is learning these things maybe he will be able to skip grades and be able to get scholarships to go towards college.|`|tHbihIcuaa	i applaud your superior genetics and whatever else you did.<br>  <br>  do everything you can to keep him challenged and thinking. id consult a specialist of some sort with this, but if there are schools around you that are for gifted children or whatever they call them nowadays, it wouldnt hurt to look at them. the problem with kids who are smarter than others is they do become bored and eventually they can slack off and will still be smart, but they may not suceed in school as much.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Stop bragging.<br>  <br>  lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I know a few kids that are like that.My son attends a "gifted program" once a week (with kids of different ages) so I see those freaky geniuses lol|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	I wish I had the answer for you but I have a four year old that is like that . She can tell you the answer to almost anything. She loves going to the library and getting what she calls the big kid books. Her favorite place for vacations is the aquarium or a park so she can learn. Does he watch the noggin channel? I honestly think that is what has helped my daughter. Sometimes I feel like telling her to slow down, take a break and enjoy being a child. Also I really pushed her on learning material instead of stupid things like video games, so I feel that has helped her. She is going to be able to enroll in Preschool this year, but I was told by the superintendent by our schools that she feels as if my baby needs to be placed up some. I am scared about that because she is so little. She just turned 4 last month. She too can tell you shapes, colors-and if you mix them this is what happens, all about animals, and almost has the shoe tying down pat. I think that kids now days are just smarter. And as for the doctors- sometimes I feel as if they misjudge our kids, my daughter has a mild speech problem and our ped was suggesting I hold her back but now when she sees him she talks his head off-pay back buddy!|`|xKpllrKnaa	Your either very lucky, or just have a tottally infatuated sense of worth for your child.<br>  <br>  Maybe u have a "prodigy".  dont **** it up, maybe he'll cure cancer.|`|eSGBXFEjaa	It was normal for me!

I'd get him in an extra program to keep him challenged enough and to put talents to use
1z3C0R2Vaa	Congrats!...........)|`|syrh8J6Vaa	You are pregnant!  The T region is the actual test line.  Even a faint line is a positive.  Congrats hun.  You can also go to www.peeonastick.com and compare your tests to other positives.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	A faint second line usually means early pregnancy as the hormone is still building up.<br>  <br>  Test again in 2 days as the hormone doubles approx every 48 hours.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	A visible line in the result window no matter how faint is a positive result. Congratulations, you are pregnant.|`|R36nThwLaa	a line is a line! deff. pregnant.<br>  congrats :)|`|yp9rEMSraa	Can you post a picture of your test?|`|QBJrycvNaa	not necessarily but there is a chance. i don't know what kind of test it is but if there is a faint or slight line in the pregnancy window then you could be prego. however, there are times that it could mean you aren't prego such as: it's a cheap defective pregnancy test or you left it in the garbage too long and took it out. Anyway, take another test. It will be most effective first pee of the morning. Don't buy a cheap one. Buy "first response" as that will detect the pregnancy hormone the soonest. If you still have a feeling you are you need to go to the doctor and get a test.|`|GZYN1rCTaa	I've been there twice now...you're pregnant!  The dark horizontal line is what shows up no matter what (along with the one in the control area).  However, the vertical line only shows up when you have HCG (pregnancy hormone) levels go above 15-20.  If there is even the slightest hint of a vertical line, you're pregnant.  The longer the test sits, the darker it will get.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations!!!|`|qq8NaJHGaa	If you had a dark line and a faint line, then you are most likely pregnant. That's how my first test was and I am now 25 weeks. You could wait a couple of days and test again, by that time the T line will become darker.|`|rJ1uwS0Yaa	Yes =) yes yes you are pregnant!!!!!!!=)Good luck and enjoy your pregnancy.|`|E7tpMkdDaa	Check for baby.

Congrats!<br>  <br>  Best Of Wishes!|`|hErd3HeTaa	Calm down!  It sounds as though she's thinking about all the pregnancy symptoms she's ever heard of and is imagining she has them all, as she wouldn't be experiencing these symptoms at that early stage.  <br>  <br>  It's highly unlikely she's pregnant if your condom didn't split or leak, as Yaz tricks the body into thinking it's pregnant and so ovulation doesn't take place.  If there isn't an egg released, you cannot fertilize her egg with your sperm.<br>  <br>  The hormones in Yaz could be giving her sickness and could definitely be making her boobs tender, though she could also be about to have her period!<br>  <br>  If there's no sign of a period within two weeks then use a home pregnancy test and help your girlfriend go to the doctor who prescribed Yaz in order to work out what's going on.<br>  <br>  She should take her pill exactly as she was told to do so as it's not good to miss days here and there.  In the meantime keep using a condom as double protection - you are very sensible!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|N6VykHCFaa	she could be pregnant but i say have her take a pregnancy test|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	It's too soon to tell.

($1200+ for a whole summer program (at least for me)) The camp is structured around the 4-Core Values, being Caring, Honest, Respect and Responsibility. I have noticed that many kids leave the camp forever changed by the fun experiences they have had during the summer. For 13 year olds during the summer, they will be attending Movin-On Camp. Movin-On Camp is a camp for middle school to early high school students. This camp empathizes on responsibility, allowing the campers to choose their weekly activities. (besides major trips) They also allow the campers more freedom as they become young adults. Campers are allowed to go where they please, for example, where ever they want to go in a theme park WITH A GROUP.<br>  <br>  If your child is looking for a fun, exciting summer camp, I suggest you sign him/her up for YMCA Camp!<br>  <br>  PS: if your child is sport-minded, they also offer Sports Camp, where campers learn a new sport every week!|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Camp Roganunda.<br>  It's kind of expensive.

GZYN1rCTaa	if you had sex on your fertal days, then your chances are very high.  The soonest you should test would be the day you should be starting your cycle, that depends on when you ovulated.  I would wait 12 days after you ovulated.  That gives the egg time to travel to the uterus, and firmly implant.  Then your body will need about 5 days to raise your HCG levels enough to be detected by a pregnancy test.|`|QBJrycvNaa	going to the Dr. and getting a blood test will be the soonest you can tell if you are pregnant.|`|e7a42e7459777cd4908b6932136dba99aa	Your chances are 10:1!!!

ebHcrGdpaa	I like them all, except landyn..I dont mean to be rude but I think its too feminine for a boy : )<br>  <br>  Carley is cute and so is megan...you could spell them different too, like Carleigh or Meghan.  Faye seems a bit old for a middle name but Joy is always pretty! I named my daughter Lauryn Elizabeth...if you like Ys in their names ill let you borrow that one ; ) <br>  <br>  You are doing a great job, none of those names are over the top weird so dont stress about it! Hey, you have good taste which is more than I can say about some of the other weird names i've seen!|`|RpK7CoSHaa	Landon Cole - love it, especially spelled this way<br>  Carley Faye - it's ok, the spelling of Carley really balances out the spelling of Faye<br>  Megan Joy - blehh, Megan is really common, and Joy is unoriginal and overrated|`|9cQ4cxg1aa	I love Landyn Cole!<br>  Carley Faye sounds ok... (i made a rhyme :D)<br>  <br>  megan joy just doesn't fit...|`|w98UhLWvaa	Landyn Cole sounds really nice.  Megan Joy is okay.  Maybe you could try Megan Starr.  Megan seems to be a hard name to pair up.  Carely Faye...I don't like it.  Sounds odd and Faye is a surname.  Good luck!|`|7TXNlZL9aa	Landyn Cole is adorable! They are not too common or uncommon they dont sound funny at all either. carley faye and megan joy flow really good together too.|`|KRQtXHwIaa	I love Landyn Cole but I would spell it landon because I think the y looks a little feminine.

Landon is growing in popularity its number 49 and is still growing. I would keep this one though<br>  <br>  Carley is okay but i also think its getting to popular while Megan seems to old fashioned to me. The middle names seem like filler middle names so i would probably change those too. <br>  <br>  what about Madelyn Sophia ? Addison Shae ?|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Landyn Cole is really nice, but I prefer it spelt Landon. It sort of looks more girly, like with Ashton and Ashtyn.<br>  <br>  Carley Faye is also really nice.

kpnSKV6Eaa	i think that its great that you waited so long to have sex for the first time... if you are considering starting sexual activity you should go on birth control. and also use condoms. if the condom is used correctly then it is 98% effective. along with birth control you would have slim to none chance of getting preggers. talk to your doctor about which birth control method would be right for you.. i suggest nuva ring. its the easiest to use. condoms are also not very complicated to use so just make sure you do it right and you should be fine|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	My husband and I used a combination of condoms and birth control pills for eight years with no incident. After coming off of those and trying for a baby I got pregnant the first time, so that definitely worked for us.|`|QR6IHIZxaa	well if you always start your period on the 27th i would suggest not doing it with that week before you get it because your 'egg' is already going down the tube into your uterus which is a welcome wagon for his ***, if the condom did break.. maybe the day after your period is best, still using a condom but you have a lower chance of getting pregnant since your 'egg' has not yet released. Also maybe if you want to be safe you could get on birth control?|`|2jiNLOKHaa	i would always use TWO forms of birthcontrol if you don't want to get pregnant. pills and condoms or condoms and those vaginal contraception films/spermicides. good luck! <br>  <br>  p.s.~if something goes haywire, ie the condom breaks or something, you can always get the morning after pill. if taken asap it really decreases your chance of getting pregnant. you can get it at the walmart pharmacy without a prescription.|`|52U22fiAaa	You could use the condom with Birth Control (which you should be on now that you are going to become sexually active), but it takes a while for BC to go through your system.  You could also try a diaphragm and spermicide to use in conjunction with the condom and ask him to pull out too.  Best to be safe.|`|436fREgIaa	WAIT TILL YOUR MARRIED..YOU'LL THANK YOURSELF LATER.I SWEAR!|`|oRaYQNXxaa	You need to get on the pill. Because trust me once you start you are not going to stop. Its better to have that assurance there letting you know that you are doing your part in preventing pregnancy. Just make sure that whatever you do you ALWAYS take the pill at the exact same time everyday without fail to ensure a more reliable form of pregnancy prevention.|`|J2f5ZzSnaa	I got pregnant on the pill and the condom because the condom broke. I didnt take my pill the same time everyday though. I am also very fertile and this is very rare. I would just do both birth control taking it the same time every day(set an alarm) and a condom. You will be fine. I am just being honest, dont let my story scare you.|`|B94rAN5uaa	just get on birth control before u have sex and make sure he wears a condom. you can tell trust me. don't let him talk u into not wearing one. i know it feels wierd but its safe. just take ur time and enjoy eachother and have fun. just fyi it will hurt because its your first time but that will pass as time goes on.|`|CsjR9Vwsaa	Condoms will work but are not 100% in keeping you from getting pregnant. I would suggest using a female form of something to back up the condom just in case.  Also you could talk to your doctor about getting on some form of Birth Control|`|zUkaqbRDaa	go on the pill and use a condom|`|4A2g95hIaa	Ok well first id like to inform you im only 16 (sorry) but right now i am going through a huge pregnancy scare. so im suggesting that nothing is completly safe because we use bc and condoms but she forgot her birth control that day.  <br>  ADVICE:rember to take your birth control for atleast 2 days before and 6days after and use good condoms.<br>  SAFE=condoms, birthcontrol, plan b and spermicidal lube. than theres no way to get pregnant.<br>  REMEBER TO TAKE YOUR BIRTH CONTROL EVERYDAY<br>  also id wait a month just so you get used to your birth control. because it often gives of pregnancy symptoms for the first month because your not used to the hormones. you probably dont want to get a scare|`|AA10967880	ok first delay it. go get yourself birth control. try and ask for a tri. this means you get different coloured pills depending on when you ovulate. <br>  <br>  so this will stop you from releasing an egg.<br>  <br>  then plan your periods. look up the cycle and plan when you are most infertile which is generall the 2 weeks before your periods. so aim for bout a week before them. there is only a small chance of pregnacy but it does happen easily enough.<br>  <br>  then get him condoms. this will stop the sperm from hopefully getting into you. another thing is before you have sex stimulate him to ejactulate. this means that most of the fertile sperm will be released. the next lot of sperm is not as fertile as the first as its not as mature. so then you can re arouse him or he can play with you or what ever tickles you then have sex.<br>  <br>  if you do these things the chances of you gettin pregnant are a one in an infinity. <br>  <br>  trust me just remember pill<br>  <br>  a weekish before periods <br>  <br>  pre ejaculate<br>  <br>  and condom so you should be safe.
hNyedM9caa	Contrary to what everyone else has said in accordance to this question, Plan B is 89% effective. Not 99% and not 75%. 89%. It says right on the package. The sooner you take it the better, so if you waited just 3 hours, you should be fine. It probably just lightened your period. Either that, or stress could be a major factor as well. It doesn't sound like you're pregnant since implantation usually lasts just a day or two and is only minor spotting (normally light pinkish or brown). <br>  <br>  Also, as it states on the package, Plan B could cause your period to be either delayed or it could come sooner than expected. It's messing with your body, remember. You should expect your period next month whenever it normally arrives. I really wouldn't stress about it.<br>  <br>  God luck, hun!! :)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	if you took the pill correctly then you arent pregnant most likely. plan b is i think 99% effective, and will/can cause an irregular period/light period/early/late/etc. since the test said negative then i would trust that you are not pregnant. your next period may be off wack because plan b can make your next couple of periods irregular.|`|B0bWrvanaa	Plan B will make your period come lighter and it should work. youre not pregnant, it worked.|`|e2muGSbpaa	Plan B is only 75% effective, so you might be. Just watch for symptoms. You might just be paranoid.
CmLDcfMfaa	Yes that is the right answer, when they show signs of being interested while you are in the bathroom.  My grandson is 20 months and he likes to go in his potty once in awhile, but that is a start for him.  My kids were older when they started to show interest.  Don’t force them just encourage them.  My grandson keeps trying to take his diaper off so I think his mom is going to get him some pull up diapers now so he can go potty a little more.  When my kids were toddlers and if they woke up dry I would encourage them to go then too.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy every moment, before you know it they will be running out the door with your car keys (grin).|`|srbUajr9aa	Around that age, each child is different. If they show signs I would continue to encourage it.|`|XRoQES7baa	It's best to start when they show an interest. My daughter was the same way and learned by 2 and a half. Girls always pick it up faster than boys. <br>  <br>  I'd recommend getting the tape "Once Upon A Potty For Girls". It's perfect for that age and you'll love the results. Click the link below... Amazon has it for under a dollar.|`|bdiSM1UXaa	My mother is a daycare teacher. She says that if your daughter is showing interest, you can certainly start at 20 months. She says the best way to start is to put them to potty if they wake up "dry" from their afternoon nap, and try to keep them entertained enough that they'll stay there.|`|VruOUdUGaa	My son is 13 months old and I have already started training.  I sit him on the potty whenever he wakes from sleeping.  He will go 2-3 times during the day, but i have to watch for his signs.|`|lqlfIEjNaa	This is a very good website. <br>  I looked at this and many others when I was interested in potty training. <br>  My daughter is 29 months and has been fully potty trained for 1 month including nights.
KRQtXHwIaa	I got pregnant with two of mine when I had a baby who was only four months old. So I understand what you mean :) We wanted them very close together, and love having it that way!  If you want another one, don't let anyone tell you that you are crazy, you know whats best for your family!|`|70Z4DJOcaa	my son is 4 months old today and i feel the same... however, i am waiting until he is at least 2 years old before i start trying again... cause i know heaps of ppl that have bubs close together and its too much of a handful! i want to give all my children all the attention they deserve, and personally, i believe i can only do that if there is a decent gap between them all. but everyone is different.<br>  <br>  another reason i dont want to go again just yet is cause my labour was pretty bad, 46 hours and i had a tough run, honestly, i'm just scared and dont want to do it again LOL<br>  <br>  they dont stay babies for long thats for sure!!! time goes too quick!!|`|zSEJC6vZaa	I think it's completely natural to want more children...you must have a lot of love to give!<br>  <br>  Well, to be honest, I want another one, too, and mine is only 6.5 months old and if I were to find out I was pregnant today, I would be happy.  That said, I think it's really hard to have two little ones under a year old and if I am realistic, I think it would be unfair to my little girl right now if I were to have another one.  I simply don't have the resources to give both the care they deserve.  Also, your body still needs to recover.  <br>  <br>  Whenever I'm feeling a little baby crazy, I spend a day with one of my girlfriends who has two young children.  That always helps to cool my baby fever a bit.|`|AA10819958	I did not with my first, my next didn't come along until my first was 5 but after my second I wanted another the day she was born.  Now i have my 3rd and she is almost 5 months and i am slowly starting to get a little bit of baby fever.
F7knBX1haa	I think is he sees the u/s he will become more excited. Also, there may be a bit of jealousy, if he cannot feel the baby move and you can. Also, what I did is let my husband pick out the going home outfit and asked about the baby's theme or options. This helps get him more involved. He should in return give back rubs. Since my husband feels more included in the pregnancy, he gives me a bath every night adn helps more with the household chores.|`|O1TekaXDaa	i seems that he is having very stressfull days at work so i think u should give him sometime rather them bombarding on him about anything and m sure he will so happy when baby born and he will b in heaven but i guess give him sometime let him relax and just give ur love to him, he will b alright and all urs.|`|ETvV9aypaa	he will be. my husband isnt in the army but it seemed like he didnt care at all that he was going to be a dad. but he did get excited at the end. just relax he will soon. he prob just focusing on working now so he can focus more on bub wen he/she comes along :D|`|AZSIoSNoaa	Mine hasn't been interested since day one! I am 36 weeks along now, he has been to 1 dr. appt. Just because I asked him right infront of his parents so he couldn't turn me down, yes I am evil. Good Luck with yours though, and God Bless|`|kKSq5VFKaa	Be patient, the ultrasound might excite him,or he's just waiting for the birth.  Men seem to hide feelings, soften him up. women can always do that, very easily.|`|lDqn5KICaa	No, he won't, and don't do anything. I wish someone had told me this. It would have saved me a LOT of worry and heartache. My husband is an Ob/Gyn, for God's sake, and he was the same way. In fact, it really doesn't get any better until your baby is able to talk a little and play. Men are not women. He won't get it, no matter what you try to do to get him into it. It's not that he doesn't love you or the baby, but think about it: the baby is alive inside of you, a part of you at this point, and your every waking (and half the time, sleeping) moment is spent feeling that profoundly. He cannot, and will not ever be able to, understand or experience that. Consider it a precious gift from the universe that you were born female, and put the energy into your love for your little one. Your husband will come around, but it will be slow, and he will probably drive you crazy a million times over the next couple years. They really don't get it at all.  LOL|`|5fdgfNCRaa	I'm quite sure he's still excited, but we all know how outstanding guys are at showing emotion. Yours, luckily, is able to do so... just maybe not a very long time. It's okay. Maybe the reality is setting in that there's going to be a baby. Maybe he's starting to realize concerns and fears... ask him how he feels. If he's worried about something, he might not want to tell you because being upset might bother the baby.<br>  <br>  Talk to him - that's the best thing you can do! :)|`|a79e59daf6cbc1fa3c2e7cfcc2fc8db3aa	you cant make him seem more interested, you can help him to understand whats going on, for you there is a constant reminder, so you stay emotionally and physically aware, my husband doesn't put his hand on my belly out of his own i take his hand when ever i feel the baby move and let him feel sometimes he doesn't seem too interested but if there is pressure on him to prove something he switches off, give him time, and him seeing the ultra sound will def help him connect his emotions with your pregnancy, try to include him when ever you can and tell him little things that happened, when you need something ask, its an assumption of women, that men must Guess what they want, when you ask an communicate and make your needs known, in a gentle way then he will eventually get to know your character and needs and may do somethings out of his own, if he is a good man then be patient and give hi time and do your part, good luck|`|2jiNLOKHaa	thats how my honey was a little as well. at first i think he was more in shock than anything. then we have had a lot of trouble with threatened miscarriages and everything so i think he was affraid to get too attached. then he saw how big the baby had grown last week and i think it is setting in more. he has been a lot more supportive. guys are visual beings. him seeing the baby on ultrasound really helped him i think. maybe the ultrasound will get him all excited again. just keep talking to him about it.|`|SZOONQ1zaa	My Army husband got interested when I started sending him the e-mails that updated my pregnancy. Every week they send an e-mail and a 3-d pic, they send tips and facts and even "dad tips". <br>  This is what worked for me, hold on and I will send the link to ya.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://3dpregnancy.parentsconnect.com/calendar/7-weeks-pregnant.html" rel="nofollow">http://3dpregnancy.parentsconnect.com/ca...</a>|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Do you want him to seem more interested or be more interested. Either way you are more likely to just get him to "seem" that way if anything. A lot of men aren't really into it until they meet their baby, or feel or see them moving in your belly...
HEdGGmkhaa	Relax, if you took the morning after pill and you came on, thats normal, thats what it does....it makes you have a period and shed the lining of the uterus.<br>  I doubt you are pregnant but if you are worried take a test, the discharge could just be a symptom of hormonal changes.|`|pxbs9Vbqaa	Most likely if you took the morning after pill you are not pregnant!  You should have definately went to the doctor if you were bleeding very heavy and for a long time. Some serious problems like anemia could affect you. But thankfully it sounds like you made it ok!! With the discharge it does not sound good, it could be something from the pill but I am worried its likely an infection. I hope you go to the doctor soon and get yourself looked after. Take care|`|S1fxKSMTaa	Well you are most likely not pregnant but you could be there is always that chance. other things also effect periods too, like stress. Have you taken birth control at all? You should try taking a pill so you have less of a chance of getting pregnant.|`|yNoENquTaa	your most likely not pregnant but go to the doctor and tell him/her immediately about your symptoms. if something says on medication to do it then you have to do.
AA11763588	It's common to get a negative if you test to early. All HPT go off of HcG's, the DR's office uses the same thing. It just reads how many HcG's are in your system. If they are high enough you will get a positive. It's usually best to test 5 days after a missed period for the most accurate result.<br>  <br>  Morning sickness usually does not come around till week 6 due to the high surge of HcG levels in your system at that time.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I always used clear blue tests and they've always been accurate for me, even one day after my missed period.  When it was negative, it was negative and when it was positive, it was positive.  I have three children age 14, 11 and 9.  There might be some exceptions but I've never heard of one yet.|`|ETvV9aypaa	i didnt get a positive until 5 days after my period was suppose to come... just be paitant (i know thats hard, but hay) and try another test... but u can get false negatives... but once u get that positive it will be definate. good luck if u wanna find out now go get a blood test done by a doc.|`|GAxJNvxmaa	retest a few days later. i took mine when i was 5 days late and got a positive.<br>  <br>  if negative again, go see your doctor and he'll find what's wrong :)<br>  <br>  good luck.
Y1Lb5f4Eaa	I wasn't trying to get pregnant, but technically I wasn't trying not to, so I guess I was asking for it. We had sex on a regular basis. I think that when you relax and just wait for it to happen it'll happen. I always feel guilty when I hear about people like you. I wasn't trying and I have this blessing and you deserve it too. I really hope it happens soon, and I wish I could be more help. Good luck and god bless.|`|SZOONQ1zaa	We got pregnant when we quit trying to get pregnant.<br>  We tried, didn't work so we just gave up and prepared to start talking to doctors...that is when we got prego. No counting the days and peeing on color change sticks, no temp taking and propping up on pillows after sex. <br>  We just sorta gave up and went back to being us, and it worked the first month.<br>  Good luck to you girl.|`|ksWm9eCBaa	Most fertility docs recommend trying a year b/4 starting expensive, time-consuming clinical stuff---but if you're ready, you're ready.  Just b/c he's had a child before doesn't mean he won't benefit from visiting a doc re: sperm specimen.  No---guys DON'T like this, but he could've had something unknown (like even a mild infection) in the time since he had a child that could affect his sperm count and/or his motility (the "moving" ability of his sperm).  It just makes sense to get HIM ck'd before you get started, as it's quick, easy and less expensive than the various avenues to be explored by the woman.  <br>  If he cks out okay and/or you're still not ready to start your 'travels', buy a Basal thermometer--and start a temp chart.  (Can keep it on your night-stand for months worth of charting...as opposed to buying/repeat buying of ovulation tests).  It's a good starting point and the charting is explained at this website:  www.fertilityplus.org<br>  One last thought:  get really 'body conscious'...to the point that you ck your underwear daily for mucus AND 'listen' to your ovarian area---you may actually feel a 'pinch' when you ovulate...if you're really aware.  Know the 'panty checking' sounds gross, but it will tell you (in most cases) when you're ovulating; most females have at least a bit of something daily in their underwear (oh--and if you thong it--switch to bikinis for this--it's important!)---As you get "conscious" of what your 'norm' is...when your norm becomes (even slightly) more of an egg-white consistency, it means you're ovulating.  During a 'normal cycle', usually anywhere from day 12 to day 16 of your cycle.  Hope I've helped...I've been there, done it all and took notes!  But....#1 was conceived when I 'gave up' and forgot about it...used the Billings Method (that mucus scenario) to conceive #2.  Rootin' for ya!!!!!|`|FvQkq7RRaa	Funny thing is I was on nuva ring for 2 years after my first son was born. I got off the ring and was pregnant 2 weeks after i had my regular period. I didn't realize I would get pregnant so fast! Before my son, my periods were irregular. With this nuva ring it helped regulate my cycles and help pin point when I ovulate! This can helpful to many women|`|5ItOGyVHaa	i agree with charlie. i gave up and "TA-DA" i got pregnant. actually i decided if i wasn't going to have kids to wreck my body. i might want to go on a diet and have a rock-en body. so i lost 20 lbs and then gained 40 with my baby. LOL. <br>  <br>  ok most women ovulate 10-14 days after the FIRST day of their period. so have sex on day 9-11-13-15. give him a day to rest. a man can take up to 72 hours to fully resupply.|`|YpOSu2tWaa	have sex every day for a month and you have to hit the right day...We tried it twice and worked both times..|`|E2hfkKJ9aa	Obviously I havent done this, cuz 1. Im 14. So no. <br>  But my brother has had kids.<br>  So all they did was "that" and it just accidentally happened. Just give it some time, and maybe your little miracle will be 9 months away.

My husband and I are trying at the moment and I've learnt alot from this web site called firtilityfriend.com  My doctor told me to go back to her if I wasn't pregnant within 6 months so maybe you should see your doctor?

Austin sounds more country.<br>  <br>  As far as other country names....I have heard of the the name Cheylenne (I'm not sure if that is spelt right).  It is pronounced Chey-lean. <br>  Others that are (maybe) country: Dustin, Colten, Lee, Hazen,  (I live in the country these are the names that I know).  For girls...Wanda Lee, Sherry, Kayla, Rebecca.<br>  <br>  If you like Taylor swift...you could use some of the names of the people in her songs...Drew...Steve.

Taylor is not a "countryish" name it's really popular and extremely common|`|EhjnLAdpaa	i would say Taylor for Taylor Swift, but your names already Taylor lol<br>  <br>  i agree with poster above with Dakota for a boy or girl(Dakota Fanning(girl) and i think Lindsay Lohans brother is Dakota)|`|9cQ4cxg1aa	Umm all of these names remind me of cowboys and indians for some reason.

jy47TEVkaa	Sweetheart, you've already had a child.  You should know by now that ANYTIME you have sex without protection you can get pregnant.|`|FOeWqr0qaa	You are extremely fertile after giving birth because your body is just shooting out hormones trying to get back to normal.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Oh yes!! After birth-- Is the most easiest time to get pregnant!|`|aZRTTPn8aa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm living proof gave birth 9/12/1996 and gave birth again 5/17/97.  When I went back for my check up was pregnant be careful very careful.|`|ETvV9aypaa	oh yeah... i was told by the doc that u can get pregnant really easy after having a kid... mayb wait til ur 6 week check up. good luck.|`|d581953cf7c9a5c24c566b6ba9022dcdaa	no you cant.. but you can still have fun<br>    next time use protective measures ok|`|6qhRFXZwaa	Yes. You can be pregnant bcos after a childbirth its really easy to get pregnant again. You need to be really carefull to prevent this.
2jiNLOKHaa	if you had sex today...look on the calendar and circle the day two weeks from now. about 10-14days after sex you can usually get a reliable answer if you are pregnant or not. not always, but usually. you can always get the morning after pill for todays incident. if taken within 24hours it greatly decreases your chance of pregnancy. you can get it at the walmart pharmacy without a prescription if you are over the age of 18|`|lwhCG1Dlaa	If I were you, I would go ahead and take a test. Just to be safe. There is a chance if you are it might not show up yet. But if you feel more comfortable waiting until you've not had a period for a month, then you should go ahead and do that. I'm sorry I know that's not much help. But I completely understand about the irregular periods. Mine were always like that. I just waited a month from the time I last started. If it didn't come by then, I gave it 2 more weeks, then took a test. They always came back positive.|`|ksWm9eCBaa	Since you may/may not know about Cycle (calendar) info often used in fertility issues:day 1 of your cycle is the first day of your most recent period, in you case, 02/04.  USUALLY you ovulate on days 14-16 of your cycle, which in your case would've been 02/18-20.  That 'usually' was in all caps for a reason:  everyone's body (& cycle!) is different....we don't know exactly when you ovulated and, therefore, were fertile--esp since you say you have an irregularity issue.  But, let's say you ovulated then...the 26th would've been beyond your most fertile days.  Headaches are not a typical symptom of pregnancy; coupled with the nausea you mentioned---you may have something else going on...flu season's not over yet!  And, no, it's not too early to find out.  If you're so anxious and cannot wait for a home pregnancy test, there is a blood test a gynecologist can do, called a BioCept-G.  It will determine pregnancy 5 days after conception and it's far more reliable than anything over the counter.  You know this, but gotta say it:  As you well know, pulling out is a/b as effective as using a condom with a hole in it......esp if his 'guys' are excellent swimmers!!  Good luck!!!|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Wait 28 days from the start of your last period.  Then take a home pregnancy test.  Even though your periods are irregular, on a normal cycle, the hpt should tell you if you're pregnant.  They are pretty accurate but if it should come up positive then go to a doctor to make double sure you are.  If it is negative and you don't get a period within the week following, I'd go to Dr. for blood test.  If you don't want a baby you must use birth control of some form each and every time!

wOLoYW7jaa	Make a solid night time routine - the first few nights are going to be horrible - but he will get it.  We had this exact same problem with my 2 year old and now she asks to go to bed.  We give her a bath, get jammies on - get all of her animals on her bed for her - turn on a small light and the radio with soothing music - we read her a story, give her hugs and kisses goodnight and shut the door.  She is usually alseep within 5-10 minutes and then the CD plays until it is over and she is in a good sleep.   She does however still get up atleast once in the night for a drink and we turn the radio back on and put her back in her bed and leave the room.   Either way, it's made our world 100% better that she will sleep on her own|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Does it get better if he learns that you are always there for him, even at night, and will parent him at night time too instead of just ignoring him sometimes?  I've seen powerful changes happen when Mom and Dad can parent with love at night and help Child learn happy associations with night time instead of 'Mom and Dad ignore me at night and don't care about what I need'.  Parenting at night is hard, especially when we just don't understand why our kids won't sleep, and I know it's easy to get frustrated, but true learning doesn't come from dealing with the behavior (getting out of bed and not falling asleep with out you), but from using that behavior as a way to teach.|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	Good luck first of all, but I promise when the baby gets a lil older life does return to somewhat of a normal life.This is most likely his way of getting attention since the baby has came. My oldest daughter did the smae thing when my son was born. But after he was about 14 months old she woke up one morning looked at me and said, "mommy, I don't need to be a baby anymore." And now she sleeps by herself, or by her lil sister. So it will probably just take time. Also another thing is at nap time try and lay him in his room. What really helped my middle daughter is I let her go and pick out her bed set. Now she says that means she is a big girl and wants to sleep by herself. If I could only get the baby boy out of my bed, I wouldn't know what to do.|`|ofH9DWETaa	There must be something he wants to do to be awake. Take away anything that would keep him awake at night.

No use trying to force him to stay in his own room when he doesnt want to or is scared as that will make him more scared! I believe that a child 3 and under is to young to sleep in a room alone. And siblings should share if possible. Do you like sleeping without your partner? do you feel more safe and secure with them in bed beside you?<br>  <br>  EDIT: To Ramseycat. children do not manipulate parents. it is our adult minds that make this rediculous assumption! Childrens brains are not developed enough for them to even comprehend manipulation!|`|ofx1a5pvaa	If he is use to sleeping with you at night then it will be harder to get him to sleep on is own. My son slept in the bed with me until he was 2. I lived with my parents, it was crowded so I had no choice. But, when I moved out it was a pain to get him to sleep on his own. I guess it was scary for him to be alone. I know most parents won't agree with what I did but, nothing else worked! One night I was like i'm tired of laying down with him to get him to go to sleep. lol. most of the time i would end up falling asleep with him. So, I asked him if he wanted to watch a movie. I put in a DVD for him, and he fell asleep. So, that worked for us. The cry it out thing, never worked with my son. And, he will be 5 in september and, he still wakes up once in awhile at night, and then I go in his room and, tell him to go back to sleep, it's late. and, he usually does. I hope this helped, good luck! I have been there!|`|SeuAdzclaa	Put music on in the 1 year old's room, and let the 3 year old cry it out.

1vaqtRI2aa	It should work, especially since you took it so soon- thank goodness. So many women and girls I have encountered took it nearly a week afterwards.<br>  <br>  The pill is about 85% effective. It loses effectiveness the longer you wait. So there's still a chance no matter what.<br>  <br>  I have taken Plan B before and I had no side effects and my period was normal, and I was not pregnant. So even though we were both expecting side effects and an abnormal period, it didn't happen. Which is normal, everyones different.<br>  <br>  Take another pregnancy test in a few days after your periods over just to be 100% sure. Some people are pregnant even when they get their periods. The body works in strange ways sometimes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	Yes it means it worked.  You are not pregnant.<br>  well done! ;-)<br>  <br>  My sister got pregnant in college when the condom broke. They didn't have Plan B back in those days...  You can thank Senator Hillary Clinton for throwing around some serious weight to get Plan B approved for sale, to overcome the block the FDA had put on its approval. She was fierce!|`|tvtEVjdkaa	well actually, in aug of 2005 I had sex with my boyfriend, and the same thing happened, the condom broke, i went in the next morning to get the plan b, and i ended up pregnant anyways lol, but if you got your period then that's a good sign that you aren't, but just to be sure you could go see a doctor
vygYFdsSaa	Yup. Skip the period its just a withdrawal bleed :)|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Okay you say you want to still be protected but you do realize that you are still protected while you are on your inactive pills, right? Also, you are going to have to ask your own doctor if he/she approves of this but I have at mine's approval went straight to another pack before to avoid having my period while on vacation. It may depend on which pill you are on though but I'm sure you could just call and ask them.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	No you can go straight onto your new pack. You may get some spotting tho.<br>  <br>  Remember the pill is not 100% effective, so use condoms too|`|qfSKgxDsaa	You can skip and it's totally okay!  The way I do it is where I do like 2 or 3 packs before I have a period...you need to have a period at least 3-4 times a year, but you're okay otherwise.  You can skip and it's nice too :)  the pack i'm on right now actually is a full 3 months and then only the last week of the 3 pack is the placebo pills, so yep it's totally okay and normal!|`|eRX96A73aa	Nope, you do not need your period when you are on the pill. You can go ahead and skip the inactive pills if you like. You actually never have to take them! =) It does your body no harm if you don't take them!<br>  Good luck!|`|D0oqTblpaa	You can go onto the next pack.  I did that when my husband came home from deployment two days after my pack stopped.  I had some spotting but it worked.|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	yes you can skip all the sugar pills every month and just keep starting a new pack...never getting a period. Its not reccomended tho cuz it can lead to spotting if you do it too long and its not natural for your body. But if you have something coming up then yea just go to the next pack, ive done it many times|`|5nwDq07Uaa	Absolutely. But don't be shocked if there's spotting! Make sure you do take your active pills next time round, though. I once skipped my sugar pills for almost 2 months during summer and my hormones went mental... dandruff, mood swings, you name it. It was hell... just make sure your body can cleanse itself.|`|UIF7OBuxaa	You'll be fine.<br>  I do it.<br>  <br>  The only problem is sometimes the pharmacy charges more if you try to get them early.<br>  <br>  Having the shot completely rids you of your period, and I've talked to my doctor, it's perfectly healthy. You'll be cool.|`|lqlfIEjNaa	You need to follow the directions your health care professional gave you and the directions on the pills. <br>  Starting a new pack when you're not supposed to will ruin the pattern.|`|z0liYA7Saa	Yes you can, don't do it two months in a row, because it caused me spotting all month, and then the whole cycle got messed up until I had my next period.|`|KlJHZRSiaa	Yes, you can do two packs back-to-back like that; just skip the 'sugar pills' and begin a new pack. But don't make a habit of it. My doctor said once a year, if you have to, is fine.|`|16c836400ca09a5e1eadd5a523f3be35aa	you can start your new pack , but wait until the inactive pills have gone by . it WILL mess up your schedule .|`|uE0jhj9Qaa	skip it it will be fine!
bw6iM8Nxaa	Counceling<br>  or I would never abuse a child ever ever ever but sometimes a good smack across the face is what they need. The parents need to make him understand that they are boss and that the parents are not the bys peers. They are the adult and they have control over him. Me and my son have a great relationship because he knows that is he ever acted that way with me he would be grounded for a while.<br>  Best of luck to your sister in law!|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	As cruel as this may seem but he either needs a slap in the face or a night in jail.  If he's hitting his parents (even though they're divorced) when he becomes out of control and starts the hitting then they either need to put that child in his place or call the police.  They need to make this boy understand what life really is and they need to do this together.<br>  They need to also know the type of kids he's hanging with and if drugs could possibly involved.  I hope they both work on finding facts out and work together with getting to a resolution for their son.|`|JLcQAWgpaa	dont get involved mind ur own business|`|lJd5OET6aa	yea tell his mom to start whoopin his ***|`|p3VaFWB9aa	honest to got if mykid ever did that to me i would take him by the hair and slam his face into a door but honestly send him to military school that will straghten him outhe will be a perfect charm after them cause that dont put up with any **** and the drill sargents will paddle them|`|JarU67Ecaa	ok what used to get to me was when my dad would get in my face and just yell at me but only when i was doing something seriously wrong. this kid sounds like he really needs to be taught a lesson though. so ii suggest if he does something bad again go into his room REMOVE EVERYTHING. yes i said remove everything, when i was a kid i swore at my father once and that was enough. he went up to my room picked up everything and moved t into another room he only left my mattres. then put me in my room. i was only allowed to come out for meals. this was for 2 days. it really was the boredom that got to me. now i suggest you do this because it really works. but since this kid is so big i suggest the father and mother be there and if he starts hitting call the police they'll straighten him out. hope i helped and trust me this is not being harsh, your nephew sounds like a brat and needs to be taught a lesson. you should probably be there too just in case they need help. (trust me this works) :)|`|kRaVa0Wraa	He needs some discipline.<br>  He's acting like he's 3.<br>  Sit him down and be HARSH WITH HIM! He's acting like an entitled brat.<br>  I cannot stand kids like that.|`|AA11973712	The kid could use some discipline alright, in the form of a good, sound spanking!
993828fb52767f45cfd24d17879210e5aa	Your body has to just get used to it. Try changing your sleeping schedule every day or week by an hour until it goes back to normal. Hope that helps|`|436fREgIaa	cut your sleep /reverse it..by the time you near the end of pregnancy,you should be on a normal pattern.take shorttttttttttttttttttt naps if you must.so you stay tired for night.it wont matter either way if your baby is a night owl.i slept nights,and baby did to after.then my other baby,thought he was on a trampoline at 2 am. its all normal.stick to a pattern.like...<br>  say you worked from 12-7 am. keep super buisy all day.no naps.when 11 pm gets there,you'll be ready for sleep all night.it may be hard the first few nights to even fall asleep.just stay there and drift off in quietness,but after a week or so..you'll be sleeping like a log.|`|AA10967880	try moving your sleep pattern an hour at a time. for a few days go to sleep an hour earlier than you would normally and wake up an hour before you normally would. do stuff like you normally do then 2 days later shift it another hour. after a fortnight or so you should be generally gettin to a normaler cycle.  but this depends when you sleep if you go to sleep at 6 in the morning it will be easier to go back wards if you go to sleep later in the day like at 12 noon it might be easier to push your self forward in time.<br>  <br>  hope this helps it what my partner did building up to shift change
kpnSKV6Eaa	dont really know about the spotting but i did get preggo on the depo shot. it doesnt work very well at all|`|e2muGSbpaa	Depo is bad for you over all. I had horrible cramps and gained tons of weight when i was on it. I mean i play soccer, volleyball, and track and still couldn't stop gaining weight. I bled off and on, and had horrible periods. I would reccomend going on a regular pill. Thats what i did, and its easy to remember if you set reminders, and all my pain and weight is gone.|`|NPeKQBtTaa	Yes if you are in early pregnancy and have the depo shot you will have a very high rate of miscarriage. I had one around 4 years ago.<br>  They are meant to give you a preg test prior to the shot if you havent had a period before hand. <br>  Spotting and breakthrough bleeding (bleeding part way through cycle) is also common on depo. <br>  Delayed fertility - takes around 12-18 months per three month needle. to get out of your system.<br>  Depo is an awful contraceptive and if you are looking to conceive i would not take it!|`|ql0mhq1Kaa	OMG thank god I find someone with the same problem, so I'm sorry I can't tell u why its happening, but I got the depo shot too on Jan 5 and haven't gotten my period ever since only been spotting an I'm still am, and then started cramping for like 1 week and a half or 2 then stoped i've been havinh headaches, lowers back pains, I eat a lot more, and gained weight but idk if i might be pregnant or these are the symptoms of the shot... I'm so confused I think i'll be testing asap, can anyone tell me their opinion????
tSKBsbIyaa	Stomach ache and leg pain could be sign of pregnancy. that all depends upon generally you have what kind of pre menstrual syndromes.<br>  About the urine test, i think you should try after 15 days of missed period, that is because, in case the fertilisation or the implantation would have been in later part of your cycle, it may not show in the test.<br>  Wait for a few more days & test again.<br>  Good luck<br>  Lot of baby shower on you.|`|XpQSpKnRaa	My wife was exactly in the same situation as you are now! She showed every symptoms of being pregnant except for the urine test turning out negative. We checked it out with our doc, and it just turned out that her periods was just unusually late that one time for whom it was always regular.<br>  At that time, she had given us a tablet (can't remember it's name though). Doc said that in case by any chance she's pregnant, the tablet will have not effect or side-effects whatsoever. If not, it will help force her into periods. So, maybe you could also have a checkup with your doc. <br>  Wish you All the Best! ;)|`|rJ1uwS0Yaa	Why don't you go for the blood test now? It will help you more than the urine tests.Good luck to you and lots of baby dust for you.|`|SM4xIodaaa	Pregnancy signs are different for each person but it does not sound like it... go to your dr.. they can do a blood test|`|WfAKZifUaa	If your periods have started, no chance of pregnancy. Period late can be a problem for which you can consult your doctor.<br>  <br>  Try to remember did you took any medicine in last 10 - 15 days, what was that medicine.
yp9rEMSraa	If you have missed your period I would take a prego test...There is a good chance you could be....just because you dont have symptoms does not mean you are not prego...
33eeb10fef182b6b0b759e0b1e10dbb3aa	just a early period... i had that before
125baa5bf060d0a198bc94914f749bacaa	Sounds like he's the same old a**hole he's always been - he shows up only when the other woman is dumping him - never told her about your daughter - can't keep promises to her, etc. Your daughter probably sees this and will figure out for herself why you're both better off without him. You've done the best you can for her to have a relationship with her dad and if he screws it up, that's his problem. Both of you girls need to get over him. Maybe she can connect with her brothers on the internet. I think you're right about it being too soon to meet the gf, unless it's a family thing and all of you meet at a restaurant. Don't make too big a deal of it and don't listen to his crap. He knocked you up and abandoned you - he screws around on his "life partner" every chance he gets - he breaks promises to children ... who needs him?|`|OaiebnhQaa	I might not give you the answer you want, or what others might give you. But in this situation i would stop him from trying to contact her. he is only making her resent him and eventually she will start asking herself what is wrong with her that he wants nothing to do with her. i would cut all contact and when she is older have her decide if she wants to be bothered with him. <br>  <br>  Now if she wants to call him then do not deny it at all!! But I would tell him either be in her life consistently or not at all!! he cannot just be in and out of her life, it is hurting her!! <br>  <br>  As for him saying that you are jealous of him and his new GF then he is an @ss. You are completely right, it is not the time for her to meet this new gf and she barely knows him! <br>  <br>  Have you sat your daughter down and asked her what she is feeling about this situation, or has she opened up on her own and said something to you!!<br>  <br>  I am so sorry your daughter has to go through this!!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	No end them. My father jumped in and out of my life my whole life I sound alot like your daughter. Always calling him and really getting no response. Im 21 with a daughter of my own and now we do have a slight relationship. Im still hurt by what he did.|`|zUiNPk3Paa	i don't know what that's like for you but i know what it's like for your daughter. my dad was the same way except in a dif state. you have to keep bothering him for her sake. the less he talks to her the worse "daddy issues" she will have. trust me, it will be hell for you, but a girl needs her daddy.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	The answer is simple.You need to have a conversation with him.<br>  <br>  Tell him that he can either be in her life or not.He cannot say he will call her and then he doesn't.You cannot be a father and a flake.<br>  <br>  Make it clear that it isn't appropriate for her to meet his girlfriend yet because she barely knows him.When he spends more time with him, then she can meet his girlfriend.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't like it, tough.|`|lBw50ySpaa	This really sucks.  Are you getting child support?  I really think you should do that at least.  <br>  If it were me, I would not refuse him seeing her.  I would have long talks with her about the situation on a regular basis.  I began talking to my boys at bedtime when they were very young.  Their Dad did their nightly reading to a parent thing with them.  Then I would go into the room, turn out the lights, and tell them to get into their sleeping position.  Then I would tell them stories.  I would try to relate the story to what was going on in our lives.  Sometimes they were stories from the Bible, sometimes from my childhood, or some from their childhood.  Kids love stories about themselves or their family.  Some times I would just talk to them about what was going on, and try to help them make sense of or at least deal with problems.<br>  The rule was be still and no talking, but I would let them push the no talking rule a little just in case there was something important they wanted to say.  If it got frivolous, I would just remind them of the rules.  Years later I read that what I had been doing was one of the best ways to be a good parent.  That many kids will tell you things when the lights are out that they won't say with the lights on.<br>  Many teachers have complimented me on my sons being critical thinkers.  I think our talks went a long way.  If you can try to control your emotions, and take a zen point of view, it will help.  I am a firm believer that all things happen for a reason.  You have to accept that this happened to you and her for some reason that you may or may not discover.  Then try to communicate that to her.  Let her know that people have flaws.  Tell her that he was weak in many ways, but in some ways he is wonderful.  Tell her that God must have a plan for her; that this trouble she is having will help her be able to carry out his plan.  Give her examples like maybe she is meant to be a teacher, and some child one day in the future will benefit from her understanding.  Maybe it is just a way of showing her how strong and independent a woman can be.  Whatever God's plan, she will be fine.  She is loved and cherished by you, and his foolish ways are because he is weak, not because she is unworthy.  He is a fool that she should try to have sympathy for, because he is tossing aside the greatest gift that God ever gave....Her!<br>  God bless you both!
qHAgbuHkaa	Oh I'm sorry. Why don't you say something to her mom? I know her mom might get mad at you, but who cares! I would tell her that its not her decision. Its between you and your girlfriend and I would tell her dare she care so little about her little grandbaby. Why don't you tell her how much your baby means to you and how cruel it is for her not to even care about that? And as far as forcing her..her mom can NOT force her to have one. By law, her mom has absolutely no legal right to force her. The ONLY way your girlfriend ends up getting the abortion is if she chooses to have one. I disagree with abortion, especially when its a pregnancy that's not due to rape. Tell your girlfriend to go to www.abortionno.org and watch the video. Then tell her to have her mom watch it. Then see how she feels. I don't think she really realizes what she's going to be doing. So many people have abortions because they're scared and then later in life, they regret it so bad but they can never take it back. A lot of people aren't very educated about abortions and fetal development either so they aren't aware of how developed their baby is. Her mom should be ashamed of herself for wanting her own grandchild to be aborted. I'm really sorry. Keep trying to talk to her about it. If you know how far along she is, look up the fetal development for whatever week she's in and show her how developed your baby is. Also, if she believes in God at all, show her some bible scripture from the internet. God considers abortion to be murder. She will have to answer to him someday. And ask her this "Can you live with this decision for the rest of your life, wondering if it was a boy or a girl and what he/she would have looked and been like?" Its not something she will ever forget about. She will have to carry this memory for the rest of her life. It may seem like the easy way out now, but it will haunt her for the rest of her life.<br>  <br>  In reference to "Wisegirl"- Not to criticize, but keep in mind, if you breastfeed, then you don't have to worry about the cost of formula. Breast milk is free, its all natural, and its soooo much healthier and nutritious. If a person is really struggling that bad with money, then they should breastfeed (and you always should if you can anyway). Plus if you can't breastfeed, WIC can help with formula. If there's a will, there's a way.|`|B0bWrvanaa	I think you need to realize her side of this. She is only 17 and a baby will be hers forever. This will change her life forever. A man can get up and leave when he wants, but a woman has to continue to be her mother. In saying that, I think that her mother can't and shouldn't force her to have an abortion but I think you two need to seriously talk about your course of action. I just had a baby last week and a pack of newborn pampers are done and I already used 2 bottles of similac and 1 container of wipes. I'm 25 and it's hard. Everything costs money. I also have my bachelors degree and am going for my Masters. <br>  It's not that its not doable, its just extremely hard and I think her mother means well and what she means to do is to protect her from having to grow too fast. 17 is way too young to have a baby. Just because you feel like being a dad now, doesn't mean you'll feel that way months and years ahead or even she will. It's a very difficult decision and ultimately it should be hers and you and her mom just need to be supportive.|`|xcF30urOaa	Her parents can't make her get one . <br>  You have to show her you'll be there for her and rensure her.<br>  Her parents might be way over the top , but maybe you should talk to them (You and her together) They will see that you want to have this baby and you'll do what is right .<br>  <br>  If you don't have a job I suggest you get one ,<br>  Im four months pregnant my boyfriend has filled over 50 applications and NOONE is hiring here (Florida) Its awful but he has gone back to school and doing what is right .<br>  I thank him so much for being here for me and i love him with all my heart.|`|bql2RJzWaa	I don't know how you'd talk her out of it. It's her body, so she feels it's HER decision. She's probably scared that you'd leave her at some point if she did go through with it. <br>  But if it is her mom that is making the decision for her & she does have an abortion, she will forever regret it.<br>  Just tell her your point of view. Help her weigh out the pros & cons...|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Her mother cannot force her to get one, and I would turn her in to social services for trying. Pro choice or pro life, you should never force your child into a decision like that. <br>  Your girlfriend should know that you do not support her decision and let her know if it will cause problems between you two. Remember, she does not have to raise the baby, just give it up for adoption. If she continues with the abortion, I am sorry, I know it must hurt but unfortunately it happens all the time.|`|IAllZ5bLaa	Are you wanting to keep and take care of the baby? Is the reason for her not getting one a religious one? Are you wanting to take care of the baby with her? Sorry I'm asking more questions, but I just want to clear some things up.<br>  <br>  Its rough being a young mother. Getting schooling is important so I can see where the mother is coming from. What does your girl friend truly feel? It is her body, and ultimately, her mother cannot force her into it, however the mother can alienate and kick the daughter out.<br>  <br>  If it is religious, maybe try to convince them about giving the baby up for adoption. If you're wanting to take care of the child, nothing works like preservation and showing that you can take care of it.<br>  <br>  All in all, just try to communicate calmly; try to put yourself in your girlfriend's and her mother's shoes. This might help you in communicating with them.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Doesn't really sound like her mom is forcing her, but that she actually does want to get one.<br>  <br>  Nice that you are willing to step up and be a man and not allow her to do this<br>  <br>  But really there is nothing you can do :( Sucks I know. But its her body and her choice. All you can do is continue to try to convince her that what she wants to do you do not agree with and remind her it is your baby as well.|`|kDQ1ZCFFaa	her mom can not make her get one it is her choice completly.maybe you should talk to her and tell her how much its gonna hurt and that if the doctor pulled the babies head out 3 more inches it would be considered murder. you know they stab the baby in the neck right? and then suck its brains out that should be against the law. if both your girlfriend wanted to have sex then she needs to deal with the consequences|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	I agree have your mom or a women adult you trust try and talk to her. If she doesn't want an abortion NO ONE should try and force her to.. That's sick.. how could any force someone to kill their child.  It's her gran-baby...<br>  <br>  I wish you, your gf, and your baby luck.|`|L6U1joGAaa	Maybe you should have your mom talk to her. Right now she is scared and taking the advise of an adult and another women. There's a chance your mom could talk her out of it by letting her know that she has other adults who will be there for her.|`|YteCvUZJaa	Ask her what she wants first. If she's really getting this abortion because she wants to (not because her mom is telling her), then you should support her decision. However, I don't agree with abortion so you should really talk to her one on one.|`|84b26tbzaa	you guys should talk to a counsler|`|zPxzBd3oaa	tell her how much you want that baby and have a talk with your parents so they can talk to her mother, its just not right.....good luck|`|vKEYa8aeaa	well by law her mom cant force her to get one, but i know that parents CAN be over the top and threaten their daughters if they dont get one...so i know she is in a hard situation. talk to your parents about it, see if they will help...it is their grandbaby too. also have her talk to your school councelor tomorrow and tell him/her what is going on, the councelor will be able to help alot too with support, finding her help, opporotunities, etc. <br>  <br>  good luck and i hope you the best|`|tivpa7Vlaa	get on one of those abortion sites that show pictures of ripped out fetuses and show it to her i am sure it would crush her heart to see how these fetuses is laying in a garbage along with others with there little bodies shredded..that should do the trick as for you get a job and start taking responsibility for her and unborn baby...don't ask her to keep the baby and leave it up to her family to support her and baby..
jhKa4Zohaa	Well, yes you should take a pregnancy test. A negative might not mean that you aren't because the hormones that build up during pregnancy increases rapidly over a few days so its best to retake another one in a week after the one you take now. It is common that pregnant ladies experience slight (very light) spotting but not an actual period after intercourse. <br>  <br>  While its soon to tell with just spotting you probably will just have a period soon but if not just take a test.|`|zPxzBd3oaa	it might be, take a pregnancy test, it'll help confirm your suspicions
53c98641fa37351a0f3c0769f6fd7ddbaa	hey...i am 40 weeks and 1 day pregnant with my second child and only dilated to a 2.5cm right now. with my first child, i had the bloody show on his due date and i found out that i am 1cm.. so it doesnt matter.. ive been a 2cm this time for nearly 4 weeks now...dont worry...u will dilated when the baby is ready.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	hey.   your only 37 weeks, your not due for another 3 weeks and your body shouldnt really be dilating until then anyway, its just a few women are lucky enough to be dilating weeks b4 labor..<br>  <br>  if this is your first pregnancy, this also explains.. most first pregnancies actually go over due.. sorry to say !!|`|yR5BhCAzaa	I'm not a doctor, but that's fine. A lot of first time moms would be worried about being dilated, worried that they baby is trying to come to soon. <br>  Besides, even if you were dilated, you can walk around at the same stage for weeks even.  With my daughter, I stayed 1cm for two weeks. It wasn't until I was induced and had my water broken that anything even happened.<br>  <br>  The real way to find out if your particular situation is ok is if your doctor thinks that you are ok. If he/she thinks that you are 'behind' they'll let you know.  Although I'm pretty sure do doctor would have a problem with this. You still have 3 weeks until you are full term, and 2 weeks after that until your baby is considered "overdue."<br>  <br>  Just keep an eye on your BP and make sure you get to every single appointment from here on out. No biggie.<br>  <br>  Congrats!
Zl9eqKn3aa	Probably your Mucus Plug.. I just lost mine too.. Labor shouldn't be far off.. Usually less then 2 weeks.. sometimes hours or days away.
o1yy6KABaa	I would say you may have ovulated 10-14 days from the 17th Feb which is the estimated calculations of fertile days...if you were on birth control before TTC then maybe your periods are slowly changing as the hormones come out of your system...it took three months before my cycles went back to how they used to be before BC but I was on it a long time and everyone is different. <br>  Baby dust to you:)
jLI0IgWkaa	I was 16 before I grew out of the stage of wearing training bras. I was pretty flat until then. In fact I had friends who used to call me "ironing board" because I was so flat, so don't fret too much. Every girl turning woman has her own timetable when that maturity takes place. relax and take it easy. you'll get there soon enough!!|`|kRaVa0Wraa	80 pounds and 5'3''? YES, you could certainly put on some weight. I suggest it, actually.<br>  <br>  being as skinny as you are, its normal for you to be "flat".|`|BBfIXcI0aa	If you're eating when you're hungry, and eating healthily, and stopping when you're full, and getting a healthy amount of exercise, then your body is just the shape it needs to be right now. You're a little on the light side, but if you aren't intentionally not eating and you're getting all the vitamins and stuff you need, I wouldn't worry about it - as puberty continues, you'll fill out. <br>  Don't worry about your bra size. Love your boobs, however large or small they are - they're going to be perfect for you! My best friend is just barely an A cup, and her boyfriend thinks they're great ;). (Besides, when your friends are whining about their strapless bras and how they can't wear cute clothes, blah blah blah, you'll be able to smile and enjoy the freedom of being able to wear ANYTHING with or without a bra. A small chest is a blessing, my friend.)|`|wX46Gv4naa	I'm just like you but thats just how my body works. It will catch up to me one day but I eat as much as I want and I'm still 85 pounds.

But I think you can be in the mass next to your boyfriend when they baptized the child. You should wear a dress, nice, not too short in light colors, not black, becouse you are celebrating. For example:
75l2smfCaa	You could always ask for one. My friend didnt know she was pregnant with twins til she was 25 weeks and she has reg checkups and ultrasounds :) it could happen!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	If you had a blood test - they can tell if twins from pregnancy blood test levels as soon as pregnancy occurs or an ultrasound at 7 weeks can determine<br>  They do sometimes miss twins- Very possible when one is behind the other.<br>  & from two heart beats being heard aswel.<br>  <br>  It could be baby kicking and punching - They move around alot inside -especially in the 2nd trimester.<br>  <br>  God Bless x Have a fetal doppler to check or ultrasound|`|T9fek24eaa	I am pretty sure by now they would have caught that. Your fundal height would be considerably alot bigger than normal, the AFP test (you probably got this around 16 weeks to test for Downs Syndrome and Neural Tube Defects) would show increased protein which would make it come back as abnormal if you were having twins. Usually doctors can hear 2 separate heart beats on the doppler. Early u/s's are usually accurate on the "head count" too. <br>  <br>  Baby's legs dont always have to be together, one leg could be up, one could be down, he or she could be sitting indian style and the feet are on opposite sides or it may have been a punch, not a kick.|`|R2OMEjrhaa	If your 24 weeks and they havent said anything yet, then it probably isnt twin. They would have found a second heart beat by now, and you would be measuring larger than normal. You have to remember your baby has ARMS and LEGS, so you can feel it in two different places.|`|AA10967880	possible but it could also just be the hand and feet. as they use both hand a feet to move.<br>  <br>  try tapping back and see if it follows you some times you can determine if they both follow to the same point on your stomach. also they respond to your voice.|`|ZzcGlrtCaa	most babies have 4 limbs. Think about it.|`|KRQtXHwIaa	Could just be that you are feeling an arm and a leg at the same time. It is funny how they can seem to be all over the place at once. I highly doubt that you have more then one if they have already done an ultrasound and you have had routine care. You could request another one, but insurance might not cover it, if it is deemed medically unnecessary.|`|ksWm9eCBaa	I was huge /w my second and I remember sitting in a recliner (in that lovely sprawled position we get in to) and my sister saying, "Are you SURE you're not having twins??"  A/b that time, I felt a kick under my ribs, simultaneously with a kick down around my ovary??  I almost fainted, thinking they'd missed a baby on ultrasound!  Not true...guess he was kicking and punching same time?  Only 1 baby!|`|Axle82kMaa	I know for a fact that I only have one baby and I'll be getting hit in the *** and the ribs at the same time lol.<br>  <br>  Or hit on one side and then the other and back to the other. <br>  <br>  If you're 24 wks they shouldof done the u/s that checks the heart and stuff(they usually do between 18 and 22wks).. They would of been able to see if there was more than one baby.<br>  <br>  Congrats and enjoy the kicks!|`|c5AJGcYcaa	when you feel movements it is not always kicking, it could be arm movements, head movements, butt movements, ect. <br>  <br>  I know that when i feel my son stretch i feel one part of him low and the other part of him high. <br>  <br>  I seriously doubt with you being 24 weeks that you could be having twins without your doctor already knowing|`|3an5DPWmaa	i'm 33 weeks pregnant and i can feel my little girl kick me a couple  different places at once too, all the time really... usually high and low.  i definitely wouldn't worry, but if you ask they might give you another US just to make sure. good luck

lGcpXteaaa	If this carries on, it will get worse and have to do what i did...help her poop by picking it out...YES picking it out whilst she is screaming in pain!!<br>  <br>  So, what solids have you introduced. Powdered cereals? If so, cut them out, i found them to be the worst for my daughter. Also bananas, they really constipated her!<br>  <br>  They sell little baby tubs of heinz prunes. Feed her them every other day and that should get rid of the horrible constipation. Also apple-prune juice. Also found in the baby aisle in jars. Give her that once a day and she will be back to normal,<br>  <br>  After these changes my daughter was better in 3 days. If your daughters constipation stays after a week go and get her checked out by her ped.<br>   x|`|BUI9HnH1aa	my sons poo it like that to .. most of the time its "moist" but when i find it looking dry i always give him some purne juice ( diluted 1:3 ) and stop with the rice cereal and banana and potatos , anything really that will clog the poor thing up , lol<br>  her tummy is still adjusting to the new foods aswell so u have to expect different poos <br>  if shes crying in pain then its getting worse and i would stop the solids altogether untill she is back to normal . <br>  Grunting is fine tho ..|`|yR5BhCAzaa	Sounds to me like the adjustment of switching what she's consuming. How much food is she getting a day? Vs. how much breast milk is she getting a day?<br>  <br>  As long as she acts the same, it isn't hurting her. If she cries why she poops, I would say you might want to call the doc to find out something to do for her to help her.
E87JwnACaa	she may be getting ready for a growth spurt. That can cause a change in sleeping patterns. Teething could do it, but, as you said, that usually results in less sleep, not more.|`|UzXYIWBgaa	it could be the tereth but she is at a growth spurt stage, they sleep to grow, its fine dont worry mommy let her sleep, hey even take a nap with her|`|4qrH4pVraa	I have found that my baby sleeps more during the day when she is teething. It doesnt keep her awake, but it does interfere with her feeding habits!! Its so confusing hey, I'm a first time Mum too of an 8 m.o. <br>  <br>  I guess they are just like us and sometimes have extra tired days or extra active days!

168e1ad6c1f54e307a02551c3b7c8caeaa	Calcium from plant sources is the BEST Source of calcium.  Animal sources of calcium are good, but not ideal<br>  <br>  Sesame seeds, and green veggies and lots of other plants are great sources of calcium so don't worry if that if you feel he is not getting enough calcium. <br>  Sounds your doing a great job in feeding him veggies & fruits and he likes them, so that is wonderful.<br>  <br>  I assume by brand of milk you mean, you tried a different brand of cow's milk.  Try Rice, Almond (vanilla flavor) or Hemp Milk (vanilla flavor).Some kids love ALmond and Hemp Vanilla flavored milks and Hemp Milk has more nutrients than Cow's milk (surprisingly).  However, those other types of "Milks" are super-expensive compared to cow's milk.  But worth a try.<br>  <br>  ALso, he is old enough for Pediasure shakes. Maybe if his Pediatrician okays it, that is.<br>  <br>  And last but not least, juice is not exactly recommended for toddlers under age 2 (but it's the parent's decision and I am sure it's not harmful), but there are great fortified with Calcium "kid's" juices on the market, so you could definitely  try those,  if you want ensure he IS NOT deficient in nutrients. But of course, talk to his pediatrician about your concerns.<br>  <br>  IT could be phase, he could be just being "independent" and wanting to do things differently (and you'll notice in other ways also).|`|UzXYIWBgaa	Have you tried cheese? if he isnt wanting th milk thats fine, as long as he is getting calcuim then he will be fine, try giving him water instead its just as good for him,. my daughter stoped drinking milk at 15 month and her ped said as long as she is eating other calcium then she will be fine|`|f7930e1b0e3632495c035cf67bd8dc26aa	dont give him the formula, give him the real thing|`|FLXQ56DMaa	He's weaning himself.. he doesn't want the bottle... try the milk in a cup maybe he's getting independant. As the other answer said as long as he's getting his calcium its ok try cheese or yougert.
DvriP0Xvaa	Well if u think is not <br>  accurate i suggest she <br>  should get a blood test done <br>  thats always right<br>  good luck 2 u guys =] =]|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	a blood test would be more accurate.<br>  <br>  baby dust to you and your wife!!|`|6qhRFXZwaa	Take a blood test.
yNki8leDaa	maybe not. i had a friend who had an irregular period for like 2 years. she would even skip months and she was just fine. i always made her take pregnancy tests and it was always negative. maybe thats just how your body is. so i stopped nagging my friend and today she just told me she was preggo. lol. if ur really concerned just  wait a week n take another.|`|DDnxY3k1aa	no|`|0kWkX8yiaa	wait a few days and then take another test|`|E2hfkKJ9aa	It would depend. If you had "that" its possible, but if you didnt, then its normal to have irregular periods. So... But I only know this cause my older sister in law, has been pregnant before, two times, and well you get the memo.<br>  <br>  If it bugs you, go get a blood test.|`|S3t69kh2aa	Irregular periods mean irregular ovulation too.  It might be a little more difficult to conceive if you don't know exactly when to have sex.  It might also take a little longer to find out if you are pregnant.|`|HRiwLWpHaa	take a blood test. its more accurate
ZcrsqMbcaa	you have to use restraint at this age. Get the syringe..squeeze her face into a fishy face position squirt the amoxicillin towards the back cheek near the molar area. They have to swallow it from back there..also do a little bit at a time not to choke her|`|wOLoYW7jaa	We have always acted like it is a treat and said "look how yummy this is" - my daughter also had a lot of ear infections when she was younger so she's been accustomed to taking medication for a long time.  We started out just giving it to her but that didnt work - so we got excited about it, now she asks to take Tylenol sometimes because she thinks it is a treat.|`|Ql6qFk85aa	You could try getting the doc to prescribe pills instead of the liquid and then crush those up into chocolate milk.|`|i8cFHtUzaa	Give it to her in some soda or juice, and don't let her know that it's in there.|`|3HR1SfGMaa	You should not restrain your daughter to get her to take it because it simply won't work.  You may be able to get the medicine in her mouth but you can't make her swallow it.  Unless you are planning on treating her like your pet and rubbing her throat to get it down, which still doesn't always work.<br>  <br>  You should either make it like a treat or like a game so she isn't scared of it.  My 2 year old LOVES vitamins, and never fights me when I have to give her tylenol.  I got her to start eating her vitamins by simply pouring a few into my hand and letting her choose which one she wanted.  Toddlers love having choices.  Now she is fine with tylenol because we use the same word for all of it, it's all medicine.<br>  <br>  I even got my daughter to a point where she likes getting eye drops for her pink eye.  All I had to do was call them tickle drops.  <br>  <br>  At one point she had to wear a helmet because she had crib head and I even managed to turn that into a game.  The first time they put it on her she started to fuss and tug at it for like a minute, and then I took her to a mirror and showed it to her (it was decorated with purple butterflies)  Once I got her to the mirror I said "Don't you like your pretty hat?"<br>  <br>  I will give one warning though if you try this approach.  You absolutely must make sure she cannot reach any medicines, because she will get to a point where she actually likes the medicine and it could be dangerous if she gets her hands on it.<br>  <br>  Edit:  On a side note, I used to work with the mentally disabled, and I was trained in administering medications to them, and I was also trained in proper restraint techniques.  I have NEVER seen the technique that mommyme described used in a healthcare setting because it is unsafe.  If you are not property trained in techniques of restraint you can seriously injure your child and I do not recommend it.  Restraint should only be used in the most extreme of circumstances which is to prevent your child from hurting themselves or someone else.  It is far too easy to break bones or dislocate joints.|`|e6jrBORRaa	I know it sounds harsh, but I have to really restrain my 2-year old son to make him take his medicine or use his inhaler.  I have a method of restraining him that I'll try to describe.  <br>  <br>  This was shown to me by a nurse.  If you are left handed, you will want to reverse these positions:  <br>  <br>  I hold him in my lap sideways on my left leg.   I take his right arm and pin it under my left arm firmly.  I restrain his left hand with my left hand.  In this position, he is pretty secure and I still have my right hand free to give the medicine.  <br>  <br>  By this point, he is protesting, but he's old enough now that he'll swallow  the medicine when I pop it in his mouth.  When he was younger, I would use the dropper to put the medicine in his cheek then keep his lips open using my finger so he couldn't spit it out.  As long as he didn't close his lips, he wasn't really able to get it out of his mouth.  But, watch out, because if they tilt themselves forward too far, the medicine will roll out.  You'll want to keep her reclined backwards so that doesn't happen.<br>  <br>  I always feel badly about holding him down this way, but I talk to him as soothingly as I can while I'm doing it and I smother him with love when I'm finished. <br>  <br>  There is one other thing that I've done before with minimal success:  Let him "give medicine" (water) to a few of his stuffed animals with an extra dropper.  I was able to get him to take his medicine eagerly when we role played this way, but when he's really feeling rotten, role-playing just won't work as he's too crabby to play.  The other drawback is it takes me a good 15 minutes playing with him this way to finally make him willingly take his medicine.  I'm usually not able to spend that much time giving him his medicine.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  I know how tough it is.  And, I'm sorry about the cat attack, poor kid!  I know that hurt.  :-(<br>  <br>  Edit:  I respect Amy's opinion about this restraint method, but I was taught this by a nurse when he had an ear infection when he was about 18 months, then AGAIN by a respiratory therapist when I was being trained on how to administer his albuterol when he was older.  When I say I hold him down "firmly", I am not holding him so hard that he can't move.  Just so that he can't wiggle free and I'm keeping him from using his hands to push away the medicine.  He has asthma and I have to get him to sit through 2 puffs (20 breaths) of Flovent from an inhaler every day.  If I didn't do this, it would be impossible to get him to stay still long enough.  I've tried turning that into a game, too.  He will play with it and put it on his face, but not until his entire dosage is given. <br>  <br>  Every toddler is different in how they react to things.  My boy just won't sit still for medicine.|`|LUD8Ge9Naa	i had the same problem with my daughter so her pedi recommended to put in a cup with a little juice but to make sure she drinks it all cause the medicine is in it. so i tried it with the juices from juicy juice and she tasted the difference. then i did it with the real oj with no pulp and she took it. try giving her the juice with a meal that way she drinks it all. don't put to much juice in it put only what she will drink cause she has to drink it all. good luck|`|02xxwMRBaa	i wouldn't know what to do either honestly. but just out of the back of my mind, possibly you can make a popsicle from the medicine and juice combined. <br>  i mean, what 2 year old would turn down a popsicle?? =)
A733M5qeaa	yeah man..she might be...you know, the only reason you are supposed to have sex is for reproduction anyway, so, good job!!|`|iuwhOxTSaa	if the condom wasnt broken then 98% chance she isnt pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  but if the condom did break theres maybe a 25% chance she's pregnant|`|CwAffLaVaa	Relax... she's most likely not pregnant! Just to make sure you should get her a home pregnancy test. It's better if you wait until the week she's suppose to start her period for the pregnancy test to come out more accurate.
MXXOICquaa	that makes no sense they should have done an ultrasound to make sure the heart wasnt beating i would go to the hospital tell them you havent felt the baby move and let them go from there but if you have felt the baby move then the baby has to have a heartbeat but in your case i think i would lie and go anyway|`|VjMyHAWraa	It seems like they would have induced you today if there was any question about the baby's well being so I'm sure everything is alright! If you have doubts you should go to the E.R. now! As far as being induced...well, I was induced with all of my 4 children. After they give you the medication you start having labor pains pretty quick! They start really hard and fast (with me anyway). It just speeds up the process! After that mother nature takes her course and here comes baby!! Good luck and don't stress! Everything should be just fine! But I do stress, If you have doubts about the health of your baby go to the hospital now!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Go to the hospital NOW something like that you shouldnt wait =( If anything happens to that baby i would definitly go after those kids, that is just horrible, did they even do anything to help you after the ran into you?|`|jgtfWjE4aa	what? i'm confused.<br>  <br>  so after the incident with the two boys you went to the e.r and they couldn't locate the heartbeat?<br>  <br>  well i hope everything is going to be alright.<br>  <br>  and i'm sorry that you doctor wasn't informative enough and that you had to come here to ask if your babys is going to be okay.|`|bkOn30I1aa	I agree with all the answers you have, there is no reason for you to be waiting, you need to be at the hospital right now. Go Go Go! I hope everything is ok with your baby, good luck!|`|kG6VWsGvaa	I am so sorry that happened to you. I hope those boys' parents were around to discipline them! My God. You shouldn't have to wait either though. Get to the ER.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	If the doc couldn't find a heartbeat you should be going to the hospital NOW. Don't wait for tomorrow!!!|`|DS21ekeJaa	They use a drug called pitosin, which is naturally found in the body, but at much higher amounts to start contractions. It can be more painful than normal start to labor, so I suggest an epidural to lessen the pain. <br>  And I would go to the hospital right now. Unless your doctor gave you more information than you have given us here. I know the fear and pain of that statement " I don't hear a heartbeat". If you already know that the baby has not survived, than you need to know they should give your the choice of being put to sleep for the induction, and will also allow you to see and hold your baby afterward. No matter how awful you feel, I suggest you do so or you will wonder as time goes on. <br>  If this doctor is a jerk and did not give you any more info, you should be at the hospital, demanding more tests to find out what is happening wth the baby.<br>  My heart hurts for you.|`|6wGkycFAaa	That's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard!!! Go to emergency at the hospital and they will do an ultrasound. Your doctor is jumping the gun! They are humans too and make mistakes, bad choices and errors in judgment. I had a doctor do exactly that during my first pregnancy and no one told me I could fire her on the spot and ask for a new doctor. You can. And should. Please, I'm begging you to go to emergency room immediately. I'm so shocked and so sorry. I wish you all the luck in the world and good health too.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	oh gosh girl I am sorry, I am 36 weeks and took a good belly flop onto the sidewalk a couple days ago and was scared to death. Keep trying to get your lil one to move around though, it could be just hiding from doc, thats what mine does all the time. Drink some ice water, alot of ice water, and just keep trying to get him/her to move around. At induction, expect them to put a pill onto your cervix to dissolve and start you dialating, and then contracting. Good Luck, you are in my prayers. need anything at all, amanda.koval@yahoo.com is my email and messenger.|`|lmk3mKJgaa	Wow Im sorry and i hope everything works out ok. If your dr was not so worried about it right now then you should be ok but if you would feel more comfortable go to the hospital and get checked out. Again best of luck to you and your lil one.|`|ETvV9aypaa	OMG really... can u still feel him moving? if u dont feel him moving dont delay and head to the hospital ASAP. if u are still feeling him move but still concerned i suggest go straight to the hospital anywyas to put ur mind at ease.. good luck|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	I'm sorry that happened, but why would they wait so long if they couldn't find a heartbeat? That's an EMERGENY and needs to be handled asap.. Go back to the doc now.|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	Go to Hospital ASAP! and when you are done fire his ***, I pray everything is fine, please tell us do you feel baby move? just get up and go right now|`|COWXFwKlaa	I'm so sorry to hear that honey, you should be at the hospital right now!!

AA11763588	It's actually normal to lose weight the 1st trimester, especially if you have morning sickness.<br>  <br>  I lost 15lbs with my 1st child and nearly 20lbs with my 3rd.<br>  <br>  If you have a Thyroid problem then your DR should know this, they can test it again.|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	DOnt even rush on putting on weight, just eat healthy and eat whatever you want dont push yourself on gaining once more,  Most important is to eat healthy diet and baby will rake whatever he need from you, you might balloon up later on in the pregnancy and might regret pushing yourself to gain Weight.<br>  <br>  I am nearly 22 weeks and I have only put 2kg so Far, I eat healthy and I walk a lot. BUt I was overweight in the start of pregnancy, even though I have not put any weight on my Baby si bigger than he should be and is really healthy and fine :)|`|AA10967880	yea go to the nutritionist. yo need more carbs i think. eat more pastas will help. its natural to loose wieght in your early stages but yes seek help to get blood tests and to make sure everything is right<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|TlFnIei0aa	It's actually pretty normal to lose weight at the start of your pregnancy.

kpnSKV6Eaa	during my pregnancy i have had excruciating kidney pains and turns out it was actually kidney stones. when baby gets bigger he pushes on your bladder and kidney and traps sedements in there which make having kidney and gall stones during pregnancy very common.. i hope you dont have them though they made me have 3 hospital stays because of it before they found out what was wrong and it was very painful. it also made me extremely nauteaus and throw up all night because the toxins could not be released properly.|`|e597894e99bf08720282624abb1be4d5aa	Go see a GP|`|DDnxY3k1aa	see the doctor if u think it's serious enough.. how bad is the pain? how frequent is it? if u worry about it a lot.. u should have it checked out.
CJkrXeDgaa	I bought a few elastic waist band skirts that I would be able to wear after the pregnancy and waited until I was a little further along before I bought any maternity clothes...no need to buy long pants now if you will be mostly pregnant in the summer months.<br>  Of course, you can find some great deals on ebay and at consignment sales.  Then, I have to say, there is nothing more comfortable than panel pants!|`|M5HyStReaa	i am 24 weeks and i have bought some maternity tops (which are longer than normal tops to cover the bump), My maternity trousers are still falling down so I am still in normal clothes that still fit.<br>  <br>  My skirts are either under or (if long) over my bump as my waist is now just under my boobs.|`|DDnxY3k1aa	i'd say.. bigger size clothes till those don't fit then buy the maternity dresses... not sure how far along i really am.. i look early still.. but medium sized pants got tight on me... so i bought two pairs of large. one large is a bit tight though... odd.. they fit funny so that's how u know u are pregnant.. but i guess the maternity clothes are meant for when u are more shaped pregnant... like second/third trimester. so we aren't ready for that yet.|`|CxJFfSeiaa	I wore Marernity pants, and sweat pants. Also a little trick would be to loop a rubberband in the button hole of your normal pants and loop that around the button. Called the rubberband trick!! :) Hope that helps out.|`|DMsjoZwSaa	11 weeks! Jeez you are going to show for at least 2-3 more months! I'd suggest not even wasting money on the maternity clothes until you have to, most of the time they only get worn in the last 4 months. I used a belly-belt type thing from Target, they are cheap and ultra stretchy...not to mention comfy!|`|ad8dOQVWaa	Dont they make pregnancy pants with strachy fabric that goes up the belly instead of a button and zipper?  You can make them too, just cut off the waistband and sew on the top of some old sweatpants, easy.|`|AA11388887	I always just wore slightly bigger clothes, at about 6 months I switched to stretchy pants.|`|fRs4nUdVaa	I just started buying bigger pants which was a big lifesaver because i didnt drop the weight fast after my baby was born. But it's mostly what your comfortable in.|`|dvQYaRNDaa	Wear what fits.|`|bkOn30I1aa	My regular clothes were fitting up to when i was around 22 weeks, still right now i am not that big and i am already going to be 28 weeks...just wear whatever you feel comfortable with, make sure you wear comfy shoes too!.

Let it go for a while...it will happen.|`|Yq3a6UAXaa	don't stress, just give it time. maybe he isn't ready yet. go back to your old routine and wait a month or two before bringing it up again, and if it doesn't happen then wait longer. some children are not ready until after their third bday. they won't do it until THEY are ready.<br>  i also recommend you get some potty books/videos for him to check out. let him go with dad/grandpa/uncle into the bathroom so he can see how they go "like big boys". <br>  good luck [:|`|02xxwMRBaa	well right now i actually have my 26 month old daughter sitting on her potty.<br>  i kinda got her to do it by using the potty like a chair and sitting a table in front of her with a coloring book and crayons... and when i hear her tinkling, i applaud her and "YAY!!! good girl!! you did pee in the potty!!!"  try this with your son and put something he really likes to play with in front of him or get him to do some art.|`|WMPqVYe1aa	Hi, maybe he is not ready yet. he will when he wants to. But one idea ive heard works is-get a little step for the big toilet, draw a face on a ping pong ball & put it in the toilet(i believe it wont flush)get him to try and wee on the ball.|`|k8GgGGOgaa	It sounds like you've tried just about everything. My daughter wouldn't use the potty chair until I bribed her with mini M&Ms. She would get one for going pee in the potty and two for going poop. I basically gave her a bunch of liquid to drink, set the potty chair in the middle living room floor, stripped her from the waist down (no underwear or anything) and waited until she had to go. This runs the risk of a mess, but it worked for me. Also, boys potty train at an older age. He might just not be ready yet. Another idea is to enlist the help of another potty trained boy his age to get him more interested. Good luck!|`|lDqn5KICaa	25 months is really young, especially for a boy. My daughter is 26 months now, and she's the same as your son. I've given up until summer. If he's not ready, he just won't do it.|`|wOLoYW7jaa	My daughter is now 29 months and we are just starting to make progress on her potty training - we've been working since about 23 months.  We let her do it on her own time, when she starting getting interested is when we started going with it.  One thing that has worked fantastic for us is a sticker chart.  There are 10 squares on the sticker chart and she gets to pick out a sticker each time she goes pee in the potty and 2 stickers for poop - she loves to pick them out and put them on the chart.  When she fills all 10 boxes she gets to pick a prize (we have a bag full of inexpensive prizes such as crayons, books, markers, sippy cup, bath toys, etc.) We also started giving her a small candy (an M&M or a sweet tart) every time she would go, she is now down to every other time since she got too smart for us and was going a small amount each time to get candy.  She now recognizes when she has to go and can even hold it a minute -  However, it's been a long time coming.  So let him get ready on his own - keep showing him the videos and talking about it and try every couple weeks once or twice to see if he'll go - if he doesnt, he doesnt he will on his own time.
IjOEpqgOaa	Oh no, don't be worried. That little man just getting to big, his long legs don't have no room! If he moving around then thats wonderful!<br>  <br>  My little girl kicked me the other day, it was a little painful! && it scared me, I screamed haha! It was just i big ol KICK one sec. So be thankful he not kicking you.<br>  Mine likes to stick her foot in my rib, or really far out my side making my belly look all crazy! <br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats again!|`|cnK4X2sZaa	normal, he's running out of room to do any kicking but as long as you still feel him moving thats all good. but i would mention it this week when you see your OB.<br>  congrats|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	hes just getting big and doesnt have room to move around anymore.. dont worry about the kicks as much as making sure you feel him moving.. as long as he is moving normally he is fine|`|MXXOICquaa	im 35 weeks and i felt him kick yesterday for the first time in weeks its totally normal he is just running out of room|`|13efe42c1b43aea736580b4a5176e231aa	it's probably because he doesn't have room to kick.  As long as you feel him moving, you shouldn't be worried.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	as long as he is still moving around, don't worry about it. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|VjMyHAWraa	You are right! There is not much room for him to kick! My son weighed 10lbs.2 1/2 oz and he moved very little the last month! We finally had to induce because my beautiful  little (or big should I say) son was really comfortable inside! But mom was miserable!! Couldn't even walk! Oh! The memories!! It was great!!! Now he's 18, 6'3" and extremely handsome!!! Good luck!|`|giRRCXU4aa	I have the same problem and I got really worried! Doctor said it's completely normal. Our little guys are just too big to really get a kick in. From now on they will just squirm around in there. YAY not too much longer for us!!
AZSIoSNoaa	Girl don't waste your money on another test, your PREGGO, congrats!!! Call the docs in the morning and set up for a blood test. What made me test early (I was 3.3 weeks along) was smells were kinda off to me and the fact that I just didn't feel right. Good Luck, and  God BLess ya|`|G8lGIytPaa	congrats! when i took my first test both lines were very light i thought the same thing. went to the doctor a couple of days later and sure enough. i have a daughter now.  dont try but i had went out with my BF and we drank i got really sick and started to throw up off of one wine cooler thats what made me get the test in the first place. <br>  sore breast, are the biggest change you will notice right off. congrats on being a new mommy.|`|2353cf98fbef8063b560af8b1555cb48aa	Congratulations! Sounds like you are pregnant. During my prior pregnancy the line was faint until I got further along.  When you take your test tomorrow be sure to take it first thing in the morning. If you are normally regular and your AF does not appear then it sounds presumptive that you are in fact pregnant.<br>  <br>  My early pregnancy symptoms were nausea and some mild cramping in my uterus and that was about it.  No implantation bleeding or anything like that. My breast didn't feel tender until I was furter along. Symptoms depend on the person.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust! Let me know how that early morning (first morning tinkle) on the stick goes. :)|`|hNyedM9caa	It's SUPER unlikely that you would get a false positive, so you're are more than likely pregnant. Congrats! <br>  <br>  Expect PMS-like symptoms. Cramping, bloating, hormonal, back-aches, etc. In addition to this, you may experience increased/decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation (ugh, I know...), dizziness, fatigue, heightened sense of smell (for example, the tea), aversions to certain foods/cravings, etc.<br>  <br>  These are all common symptoms in early pregnancy. However, no one is the same. Some don't experience any symptoms at all until later on (lucky them!). I'd suggest reading up on it. The internet is FULL of wonderful information! You can even find week-by-week progression of your baby and see what is going on in there.<br>  <br>  In addition to this, set up an appointment and get a blood test so that you are completely 100% positive. Then it's time to start taking your prenatal vitamins and staying healthy for the little one. Congratulations!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, hun! :)|`|WMPqVYe1aa	hi, congrats-maybe the line is very faint because your only just pregnant-body just starting to release hormones due to pregnancy<br>  I didn't know i was pregnant with my second daughter-nor was i trying, until i took a bag of rubbish out of the bin to tie up and i nearly threw up & i noticed that certain smells had been making me feel sick.|`|Axle82kMaa	The only symptoms I had were cramping..and then at 14wks i started leaking out of my boobs and they started hurting.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10153923	Your pregnant alright, no matter how faint the line is.<br>  CONGRATS!!!<br>  <br>  Loss of appetite, <br>  Being VERY, VERY tired.<br>  Breast tenderness, <br>  Headaches, <br>  Nausea <br>  <br>  Fun stuff huh? ; )<br>  <br>  EDIT: OH BTW! I had a very faint line on my test, then I peed in a cup and just soaked the test. Then the line became clearer|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	Faint positive is Positive! Yay you are pregnant congratulations!! :)) I am in my week 22 and even now I cant believe I got pregnant :) I told my Husband yesterday OMG i cant believe I am pregnant :)) and Baby was kicking me in ribs :) I am saying that because it might take sometime to get used to idea and feel really happy and not be scared but this is all down to hormones! :) do another Test tomorrow if it  makes you Happy and then book doctors APPT :)
ISjFdI1taa	Check your car insurance - some stipulate 6 weeks, but most don't.  I phoned my insurance company to check.<br>  I drove after 2 weeks with my second c section.  Basically the advice is that you can drive as soon as you are out of pain and able to do an emergency stop.  My first c section was an emergency and I didn't feel up to driving for a few weeks.  It varies depending on how you feel.|`|498JdszFaa	Till you're certain that (while driving) you can deal with the pain that it may cause without endangering yourself or others. In short: better wait till the moving pains are over.<br>  <br>  You need to lift your leg(s) while driving, which is a painful movement.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Well, Someone is an early bird!<br>  <br>  The general advice is to wait 6 weeks before driving; however there are women who went back to work and/or driving from as little as 1 week. <br>  <br>  Please take a look at the links below, they're useful and related to your question.|`|kykmpr0Caa	you should be advised by your doctor that you cannot drive for minimum of 6 weeks after a c section, due to fact you have had major abdominal surgery. if you crashed you insurance wouldnt be valid. ring and ask if you dont believe me|`|JbHdLERgaa	the advice is 6 weeks and try stick to it !! also check with your insurance company as they may not cover you till 6 weeks after your c-section|`|UtvBfdR3aa	We don't want you on the road.|`|bx29mHrYaa	well docs say you should wait for 6 weeks before driving, BUT we all have to get on we cant just sit around for 6 weeks...... I think its something to do with you not being insured for 6 weeks after a <br>  c-section...... . But altough im havin my third section i WILL NOT be waiting 6 weeks as i have two other kids to look after. its just not realistic is it....... I will wait around 1+1/2 -2 weeks tops. Depending on how i feel of course.
dIW2tVxhaa	Okay. Take is slowly, stop pushing your body to do stuff before it's ready. You've had major surgery and you need time to recover! Meanwhile, you can take Arnica pillules to help the swelling and bruising lessen a bit faster. The more you push your body early on, the longer it will take to recover fully. And believe me, you'll know about it iof you bust your stitches open...|`|13efe42c1b43aea736580b4a5176e231aa	i hurt for a good two weeks after mines.  I was taking vicodin but you probably won't want that because you are breast feeding.  You really have to just take your time and take it slow because you can't rush your body into healing.  I was mad too cuz i had stuff i had to do round the house and couldn't.  I tried motrin the first time around and that worked better than the prescribed stuff so maybe that will work.|`|AA11520456	you can only take paracetamol. i had c section myself... wait for another week and you'll be better... try not to move around fast.. take it easy.|`|W0AK2Lumaa	Nope.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	I have an idea.... maybe you should start driving- just like YOU want to!  That will help A LOT!!!|`|kykmpr0Caa	AND YOUR ASKING WHEN YOU CAN DRIVE AGAIN...??????????? <br>  <br>  i had this after i had a section, i was told it was where they may have nipped a muscle during surgery, it should go away within a couple weeks from surgery, muscles heal quite quickly apparently.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Contact your midwife or GP to get a suitible painkiller. Paracetamol does f--- all!!<br>  <br>  Not all women experience a fast healing after a C-section, I know a woman who couldn't pick her baby until 4 months afterwards and had her mother babysitting the baby until she recovered!|`|z7YyYCYRaa	after my c-section i had awful pains and could barely bend over to get baby out of her basket, i went to my gp and found i had a little infection.<br>  <br>  maybe its worth going to see your doctor incase you need some antibiotics.|`|oem5yEUDaa	You shouldn't be lifting anything, including your baby, for six weeks. You need to have someone around to help you. If you keep lifting it's going to take longer to heal.
xMT9XTT6aa	I'm so sorry you're going through this honey...I know some of what you are feeling and my heart goes out to you. <br>  <br>  I was pregnant and at about 6 weeks gestation and everything was fine. I was sitting watching tv and got up to go to the bathroom to find that my underwear and pants were soaked with blood. My boyfriend rushed me to the hospital and while waiting for the doctor I passed a large clot. The doctor examined me and said I had definately<br>  miscarried my baby. It was devastating. I stayed in the hospital overnight because I had lost so much blood and they wanted to monitor me so I knew there was no hope that they were wrong. <br>  <br>  Three days later I had a ultrasound and to my shock and amazement I was still pregnant. The doctor said I could have possibly passed a twin but they couldn't be sure exactly what had happened. I continued on to have a completely normal pregnancy and a healthy baby.<br>  <br>  Honey, I don't know how this is going to turn out for you and I don't want to give you any false hope. It can happen but please be prepared for the worst.  <br>  <br>  My thoughts are with you.|`|AA10153923	I hope you have not, you will be in my thoughts.|`|i3t1BhNmaa	Hey !<br>  Wow what a twist of events ! my thoughts are with u hon !<br>  If the ER heard a heartbeat then there is no mistake that there is smone living inside :)<br>  <br>  U know my doc said that(after doing a scan) that i had miscarried (7w2d)and i'm supposed to come and c her after my period next month. This was in early Feb. I'm always having a cycle of 25-28 days. (never late on my period). I was supposed to get mine on the 2nd of March and i'm already more than a week late. I'm still continuing to have backache/ metallic taste in my mouth (never had morning sickness)/ extreamly tired/ terrible mood swings/ pee a lot/ sore boobs/hav had watery pinkish discharges/ period cramps but no period. I'm thinking that i might still hav my baby inside me and too scared to go and c da doc.....<br>  <br>  Hope it goes well for u !<br>  Gud luck|`|3N5ZovGXaa	Well first of all I hope you are going to the doctor very soon, because that would drive me insane!  Second of all...Yes I was told that I would miscarry with my youngest son.  It was a bit different, I had had a miscarriage before, so they did blood work, and the Doctor called me and said unfortunately my HCG levels were very low and did not double like they should in a normal pregnancy, and that she was like 95% sure I would miscarry.  Well I was devastated, horribly!!  I had a good friend that remained optimistic and really helped me get through it!  I just waited and waited thinking any day it was coming:(  But to my Doctors surprise every check up everything was great!!  I delivered him about 2 weeks early, he was 7lbs and 8 oz, very healthy, and he is doing great!  I don't want to mislead you though, this is not common, it was by the grace of God I continued to carry him.  I truly wish the best for you, and just try to keep positive!!!  Anything is possible, and just hold on to that hope:)  Good luck sweetie, and God Bless you and your baby!<br>  Please if you could let us know the outcome, I will be checking on this one!  I really hope everything works out for you!!
342fTepYaa	Copied and pasted:<br>  Precum or pre-ejaculate is a fluid coming from the penis and is produced by man’s bulbourethral glands. The main bulbourethral gland is the prostate, and there are also few smaller glands that are situated in the body of the penis. They produce clear liquid that is similar to other mucous excretion of the body, the main difference is the different contents of proteins and increased concentration of sugars like fructose. Precum’s main purpose is cleaning the urethra from any bacteria or the leftovers of urine, also precum is a lubricant that is used for lubrication of the glans and foreskin during the intercourse. Depending on the person precum may or may not contain small amounts of spermatozoids, the chances of pregnancy are small but, since in theory, only one sperm is enough to get a woman pregnant there’s still a chance that the pregnancy will happen. It would be the safest to use condoms during the entire duration of the sexual intercourse. <br>  <br>  But seriously if you have to ask, like a previous answerer said .. you shouldn't be *******.|`|82dikbhoaa	Aree you dumb?? <br>  <br>  Your picture makes you look like your 45 <br>  you should know that unprotected sex of any <br>  kind lands you in the possibility's of being <br>  pregnant every women knows that... <br>  <br>  did your mother ever teach you about sex?|`|fRs4nUdVaa	Yes you can but its highly unlikely.

AA10967880	this is one tough decision. <br>  <br>  for starters you should speak to him. its his child as well.<br>  <br>  no one can tell you yes or no to an abortion. there are may cases where women regrete aborting and otheres where they dont regrete it at all. women who kept the child and then were poor mothers because they resent the child for taking away their youth and then mothers that would never give their child up.<br>  <br>  since he is 16 you need to speak to his parents aswell hes not matured enough to think far enough head of time to understand the full conciquences.<br>  <br>  ask yourself<br>  <br>  are you ready  for a child (mature enough)?<br>  are you living in a stable situation or can you move to a stable situation (eg home and money)?<br>  are you willing to stay in contact with this boy for the next 18 years?<br>  are you willing to put another human being before you?<br>  are you prepared to give up certain luxturies such as goin to the movies and spendin your money on just yourself?<br>  would you enjoy the constant love and need of a child?<br>  are you wanting to experience the joys of motherhood and see a baby give you an unconditonal smile of approval?<br>  <br>  <br>  you have to ask yourself these things. sit down and right out a list of pros and cons for keeping and aborting the child. you can also give the child up for adoption. specially if you have a family member who would be willing to take the child. <br>  <br>  talk to your mother and his parents run through all the details and decide no one on here can tell you how to deal with your life,<br>  <br>  most of all dont listen to all the religious sh!t saying all life is sacred and deserves a right to life. its a bunch of cells for cryin out loud. but on the other hand. this is your child your off spring that will grow and the longer you have inside you the more attached you will become.<br>  <br>  i know you will make the right decision. research all the topics and options available. even if your mother is angry she will help you throug this.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ngkNaQJeaa	noooo don;t if you think that you cannot handle this child, give the child up for adoption, don't take the child's life away because of your own selfish pleasure.<br>  aw hun, does your family know about this?<br>  are they supportive?<br>  they deserve to know, even if they do flip out, you may be surprised on how much help they can give you. even if he isnt ready to be a father, be a good mother. or there are so many people who cannot concieve and actually wish to have a child, please consider adoption if you dont keep this child, i seriously recommend that you get an ultrasound, when you actually see the baby, many mothers change their mind and decide to keep the little one.|`|3SspTmIeaa	i wouldn't have an abortion...right now it seems like it would be the right thing to do..but in the long run you would never forget what you done...i think you just couldn't fight the feeling that night need to take to the next level...but this isn't the end of the world if i was you i would just talk to people who have had kids in there 20's and ask them how they made it threw|`|cnK4X2sZaa	at 20 you should know better... your about to find out just how exciting sex can be.... deal with your actions dont run and cop out with aborting. thats not cool.... and something else thats not cool iis the fact that at 20 you were with a 16 year old.  thats SICK!|`|O1TekaXDaa	1st of all what was the necessity to have sex on such small age,<br>  abortion is the only option u have, else get marry and start ur marriade life.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	No you shouldn't get an abortion, ain't the childs fault, Why you are sleeping with a 16yr old I will never understand, but seriously, don't get an abortion, ain't the childs fault.|`|f7930e1b0e3632495c035cf67bd8dc26aa	If you don't want to get an abortion adopt it so a family that can't have kids can have one|`|xubIaiZaaa	yes it is your fault and i hope you get found out and go to jail|`|2353cf98fbef8063b560af8b1555cb48aa	I am sorry to hear that you are going threw such a dilemma. <br>  <br>  About abortion..... that is your personal choice and your right no matter what anyone says. You have to do what you feel is necessary.  My cousin asked me to go to the abortion clinic with her and although I did not want to go I wanted to support her because she was alone. I sat in the room when they gave her the twilight and then I got up to leave and they told me I could not leave the room and it was too late.  I cried for days because I could not believe that at 5 months pregnant, they would perform an abortion on this baby.  It is an experience that I would not recommend. My cousin cries about it to this day and regrets ever getting it and I regret ever being in that room.<br>  <br>  Adoption may be a better option if you felt like you could not care for the baby.  Ask the father about what he wants *regardless at the fact that he's 16* and make the decision together.<br>  <br>  I pray that your decision is in the best interest of you and baby.|`|Axle82kMaa	For one, That's rape.<br>  <br>  If you're asking about an abortion then I'm guessing that's what you already have your mind set on. I wouldn't get one, but then again I wouldn't want to go to jail for rape either..|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	Wow this is wrong on sooo many levels.. This has to be joke.|`|HHI5q9r4aa	LMAO you slept with a 16 year old?!|`|AA11520456	why did you have sex w/ your best friend?|`|xZigibGYaa	wow, are you studying to be a teacher too?  SICKO!|`|VjMyHAWraa	Great! You're having a baby with a baby!! Couldn't you find someone your own age???|`|VuGPufs4aa	pro choice|`|P6trt7u4aa	Abortion is Murder<br>  <br>  If you do not want the baby that give it up for adoption.  There is like a 5 year waiting list for people that want a baby|`|57LFRfqCaa	I hope the excitement was worth it.|`|AA11851101	Shouldn't you be responsible for your actions? <br>  Is that what u are going to do each time this happens?|`|qzY6TuQmaa	hmmm u didn't think about this b-4 u did it huh... u can go to jail for sleeping with him.
75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	It may have been faint because you are early and there may have not had enough hormone in your pee. Best advice is to take one first thing in the morning. If it was a positive, even a faint one, you are more than likely pregnant. It is incredibly rare and pretty much impossible to get a false positive. I didn't have many early preg symptoms as well.|`|woEoXfaZaa	Yes it means you could be pregnant - go to the gp and have a blood test to be sure.<br>  <br>  It would be a really light positive line if your period is not due for a while - good luck :)|`|AA10153923	If the line is there its there, congrats.|`|wNGIhlM7aa	you could be....however check with your dr. you might need a d & c....my cousin died of cariocarcinoma because the dr did not test her hgc levels right and she developed cancer which caused kidney failure, cancer in the brain and lungs...<br>  <br>  if you are congrats, i just dont want what happened to my cousin happening to you<br>  <br>  i took a pregnancy test at home 2 weeks after unprotected sex and got a faint line....now i have a baby boy|`|3N5ZovGXaa	Wow...what a shocker huh.  Well I would like to know the brand of the test, but without knowing I would say there is definitely a big chance you are pregnant.  Those tests are very accurate and even the slightest second line is usually an indicator of a positive result.  Just because you don't have symptoms could be that it is so early on.  Usually tests don't read positive that early, but stranger things have happened.  Personally I would buy another test with a couple tests in it, see what those show.  Other than that, I guess you could go to the doctor and see what they say.  Good luck to you:)|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	You are getting a false positive.  You are only on cycle day 10 and there is almost no way that you ovulated, fertilized an egg, and had implantation in that time... unless you got a period even though you were pregnant which can happen.  I recommend either taking another one to make sure or making an appointment with your OBGYN.  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I was TTC with my fourth and found out I was pregnant on CD (cycle day) 26, 10 days after I ovulated, and 4 days before my period which is the earliest that a HPT can detect the pregnancy hormone.<br>  <br>  One more Edit:  After doing some research on this, I recommend making an appointment with your OBGYN.  It is possible that tissue still remains that has the HcG hormone in it - or that you are just getting a false positive  - either way, its best to have your doctor take a look just to make sure.  I wish you the best.  Hang in there - honey.<br>  <br>  Take a look at this site: <a href="http://www.pregnancyloss.info/waitingforaf.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancyloss.info/waitingfor...</a><br>  <br>  click on About Follow up Exams then scroll down to the question: Why do I start and stop bleeding and the hCG refuse to fall? It's been several months now!|`|bkOn30I1aa	I think it is way to early to know if you are pregnant, i would not trust that pregnancy test too much. Dont worry about it for now, just wait till the day you are expecting your period. Good luck!
AA10445217	I am 38 weeks pregnant too. Im very ready and I think Baby is too! I want it out! He is causing me painful pressure and I have to pee all the time. Sometimes my legs get "stuck" and I cant walk for a few minutes. My feet are swollen and my knees are so puffy it looks as if I dont have knees! And my lower back is killing me!

I love feeling my baby inside and will miss it greatly but I think there's just a point you reach that you just feel like that's enough lol. I've got a 4 year old too and it annoys me I can't do alot with her these days either which is frustrating. I just can't wait til I go into labour knowing it'll be all over and I'll meet my new bub.

fTLzKg5Eaa	180 millimeters what is 180 millimeters? is it baby itself?<br>  if you are in early stages of pregnancy it is possible  that babys length is 180MM but otherwise it can be anything...it is just a measurement|`|i6mydMOyaa	It's referring to the length of something that was measured. <br>  <br>  You would have to specify what was being measured. A cervix, the baby...etc.
ux6j2OIeaa	thanks for the link, looks like a good site!
AA11763588	Nothing can "make a miscarriage" 99% of the time they happen because chromosones did not meet up correctly when forming the baby.<br>  <br>  Stress and other things can trigger one, but it's not something that happens a lot.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	genetic defects are the #1 reason for miscarriages...<br>  <br>  anyway...?|`|AA10967880	a miscarriage is when the sack that the baby is protected by becomes detached from the womans uterus. this causes bleeding. a chemical change in the body or trauma can cause a miscarriage. sometimes its just nature and the womans body was not yet ready for a child.<br>  <br>  NOTE TO OTHERS just because a male is asking doesnt mean he intends on aborting his child or anything. <br>  <br>  my partner is curious about my pregnacy too and has been asking all sorts of wierd and wonderful questions. from how big is it to how do i feel to if we have sex where does the sperm go? sort of thing he wants to make sure that the baby is fine with everything i do. and good for you for being curious.|`|nTNnSpclaa	hmm, a lot of miscarriages happen spontaneously.  If the fetus has an incorrect number of chromosomes a miscarriage is very likely.<br>  <br>  If you are asking about specific agents, I won't answer that because this is the internet.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	Smoking, drinking, doing drugs, falling down stairs/on your tummy, stress, chromosomal issues, or it can happen just because. You can be doing everything right in your pregnancy and still get a miscarriage.|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	thats called abortion.... and being a guy its odd you are asking it.
d8b679aafc18801188a471ee28b26000aa	Sundar! Let us be very honest here because it involves someone else's life too.<br>  Stay back and try working your marriage out by overlooking the "lie" if only you think you have such a big heart, if you think the girl has other qualities which can overpower this. If you think that you can handle this strongly enough throughout your life without making her feel guilty for what her parents did and she was a part of it(willingly or forcefully).<br>  <br>  BUT if you cannot and you think you will always live with a grudge against her, please step out of the marriage before its late further. <br>  <br>  She will manage to live with it at the end but being in the marriage, fighting her health and then going through the emotional trauma of not being accepted by her husband and in laws could make her life miserable.<br>  <br>  If you cannot accept her the way she is, just let go of her. I think that would be sane for both of you.<br>  <br>  But Sundar, one more thing, how many of us come forward and accept the practical challenges? Life has come to you with one, do think about it. Talk to her. What if she was physically fit but a jerk and a shrude person who would have spoilt the sanity of your family, then? <br>  My mum in law married my fa in law knowing that he had a disease which will keep him bed-ridden all his life and he would not survive beyond 45 years. <br>  We all live normal lives and die one day. People who are tough, strong and special only can leave a mark.<br>  <br>  Think hard!|`|DS21ekeJaa	That is one of the downfalls of arranged marriage. You live with it, just as she has to live with her problems. She is your wife now, so learn to see beyond the imperfections to wonderful person she is inside.|`|rHwxnhCOaa	its too stupid to happen this kind of marriage because no one can accept his wife to be a physical defective .so the parents should tell to children to accept because they had done a mistake.<br>  <br>  and the boy should understand if in case after a month/year if she is getting defect by an accident what he will do , just like that he should think and take her happily and should not think about she is defective .<br>  because she may be having physical defect but when a husband gives this much of love she will be able to do all the work by her self and get confident that she is not a physical defective person and gives more love to her husband.<br>  that what i will do and every on should do in this kind of situvations.|`|T9fek24eaa	The boy should just get the f*** over it and be a man about it! What kind of question is this!?|`|rJ1uwS0Yaa	It's hard for think.=(|`|Axle82kMaa	say what?
KmC0K59taa	I only have a 2 yr old girl.  My husband has a son that is now 10 and he potty trained him to stand while peeing.  He said it was difficult.  A lot of moms I know teach them to sit first.  When they get the hang of it and they get a little bigger, they had daddy step in and show him how to pee standing up.  I cannot imagine the mess a toddler would make standing up to pee!!<br>  <br>  In some countries (Germany is one) men do indeed sit while peeing.  They will ask American men to do the same as not to get their seat wet!|`|4BoteYDwaa	If it helps him get through his potty training, I say go for it. He can work on his aim later. He will pee standing up when he's ready, it's in our nature.<br>  Set aside your past, your son is your future The idea is to make him better than you, and give him a better life than you had.  Use what you have learned in life and teach him how to make better decisions. Try to provide a healthier life, and a better education. Teach him how to be a respectable man.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	If you are for real, no, nothing wrong with having him sit. There are multiple reasons why it makes sense.<br>  <br>  But if he's three months old, why is this really coming up? It's at least a year, more likely two years off.|`|EBkW1ME4aa	yeah, i would laugh at him if he was my age and had to go sit to pee. Boy's restrooms are kinda dirty and making him sit to pee is kinda abusive lol. Your son is not your dad or husband or boyfriend, so get over it, he's from your womb and don't make him suffer anymore than that he has to deal with, no father and a mother who can't deal with him.|`|PfP8LSF6aa	Umm that's really weird. Maybe you should have a man figure around when that time comes. That way you won't have to teach him too pee, the guy can. I mean that's how it goes, woman sit, men stand. It's normal.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	how strange- but sitting to pee is not a problem- actually cleaner that way if his aim is bad- haha<br>  <br>  but seriously, boys are totally fun, just enjoy him!!|`|i8cFHtUzaa	I don't think it's wrong at all.<br>  <br>  My 8 year old brother was taught to sit when he peed, and it was very helpful- No missing!<br>  <br>  Little bodies have very poor aim.|`|3RGqsE7Qaa	Yes, because if he makes that a habit it could become an issue.<br>  <br>  He could develop a mental complex and have to pee sitting down<br>     *pissing in public bathrooms could be an issue.  <br>  <br>  The piss could escape under the rim of the toilet for a while as he's learning to pee sitting down.<br>  <br>  The force of the piddle leaving your son could cause it to back splash onto your son, soaking him in piss.  He would then be forever known as pee pants behind his back... and sometimes to his face.|`|JITTMjasaa	You need to get over your issues before you cause your little boy to have them. I always wanted a boy but got another girl. I would never tell her that or make her feel bad about it though. Be grateful for what you have because there is always someone out there wishing they had it. We need to make this world a better place by making the people better in any way we can.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	you still have a while before you hit the potty training stage...but to answer your questions it would not be harmful to have him sit to pee...my 5 year old sits to pee because he has bad aim and i got tired of wiping pee off the seat all the time...he's none the less traumatized for having to sit to pee.|`|PrRNMDXRaa	hes a boy! us guys stand to pee darling, dont teach him the wrong way. That wouldnt be right... If you going to do that you might as well put makeup on him, dress him in pink and let him play with barbies. I mean all that with all due respect, i just want to get my point across|`|wDOjkaYUaa	You may begin teaching him to use the potty while sitting but after he becomes comfortable with the toilet than you really need to teach him to stand. That would be the best thing in my opinion. That is how my mom taught me and it seemed to work fine.|`|q6hOg022aa	suppose to stand but sitting is okay til theyre at next step knowing when to go step 2 of potty training.|`|oZ5QPymuaa	well just let him be till you feel like telling him that he can stand and pee|`|f8adc4c9c88d9c4a99289b4da8ed6c76aa	Boy, this is kinda hard to answer cuz we don't know what issues you have and why you have a problem with your boy standing to pee. Without knowing the issues, it don't make sense. With my boys, I started out training them to sit and pee but when they felt the urge to pee and knew they had to go and started telling me I changed and had them stand and pee like a normal boy would. I am just not understanding what the problem is with him just standing. It is so much easier for them. If they don't have to pull everything down then don't. Just unzip. Your past issues aren't your boys' fault. Don't make him suffer. Get you some help. Like you said later on down the road he WILL be made fun of if he has to sit and pee. I mean are you gonna have him stand and poop? Seriously.|`|7imMv3Niaa	1 ) either way he will have to hold it or get a wet floor (personal experience) <br>  2 ) he will have to learn sometime and before he is made fun of at school<br>  3 ) your not holding it for him and you don't even have to watch - so whats the problem?<br>  4 ) you don't stand to pee in a potty - you stand to pee in a toilet or urinal so this comes later...|`|ngkNaQJeaa	yeah it's wrong?<br>  do you want him to be made fun of?<br>  and how the hell can you not handle him standing to pee, that is seriously weird!<br>  ok sorry for being harsh but if you cant handle it, have someone else potty train him, like a close relative.|`|KqrazQtxaa	YES!!! It is wildly wrong. Males stand to pee. End of story.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	you won't have to worry about this for a couple more years or so.<br>  <br>  boys learn to use the potty by sitting at first.  get him a potty chair when the time comes.... <br>  <br>  take care.|`|UI6vdCrWaa	if its too hard for u try getting someone else realy close to u to help him with hes potty training|`|aY08TZIaaa	ok
WMPqVYe1aa	Hi, i don't think he will ask until he is probably at school, and these days there are a lot of kids who don't have dads, so its not uncommon.  Don't tell him until he asks and hey, maybe in the mean time you will have met someone who will take care of you both.  As for his real dad-who cares.  When your son grows up, maybe then you can be honest and tell him the real reason hes gone.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I cannot believe you let him be there for the birth. You need to seek some counseling and work out these concerns there. You leaving him is absolutely the right thing.|`|DS21ekeJaa	Usually, kids don't ask a whole lot of questions about their parents until they go to school. I would keep it simple, be straight forward but not bad mouth the father. You don't know what changes may come and how much involvement he may eventually have in your child's life. Stop worrying about the father, he sounds like a jerk, and  enjoy the baby you have in front of you. When the questions come, you will figure it out.|`|LJfAhlJ6aa	Tell him the truth (well maybe not emphasize too much on the killing part) and that the best solution at this time is that you are apart. at school he will feel that he is missing a parent (especially at father/child days etc) but try to explain to him that sometimes people are better to each-other when they are apart. And that you know his father loves him etc. But dont keep it a secret (its best he knows from you than anyone else)|`|3HR1SfGMaa	I have been wondering the same thing, my daughter is 2&1/2 and her father lives on the other side of the country (thankfully)  He calls her maybe twice a month.  <br>  <br>  What I have decided to do is not bring it up at all until she asks.  Personally I don't think you should tell your son what a bad person his daddy is though, if he ever actually meets him he'll figure that one out for himself.  <br>  <br>  What I plan on telling my daughter is that mommy and daddy just couldn't live together anymore because we couldn't get along, but we both love her very very much and nothing will ever change that.  I feel like at a young age that's all the kid is really asking for, reassurance that you both love them.  When they are older they will be able to figure things out themselves.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Whlvlbmmaa	i just went through this exact thing with my 4 year old son and i was honest to a point.<br>  <br>  a little boy doesn't need to know that daddy hit mummy, you can answer that better when they are more like 10-15 or even older.<br>  <br>  i told my son (and a few curious friends of his, you will get those questions from his friends too) that his daddy had to live somewhere else because him and mummy didn't love each other any more (but he is loved by both of us) and daddy wasn't nice so it was better that we live somewhere else.<br>  <br>  you did the right thing, your son will always have the opportunity to get to know his father when he is older but its better for him now to be in a safe and loving environment.|`|f8adc4c9c88d9c4a99289b4da8ed6c76aa	I don't think they will be asking that question until they are about 5. You have plenty of time to find someone else to fall in love with and he can be his daddy. In time you, when they are old enough and you think he will understand you can tell him in simple terms what has happened. Don't go into great detail. He's just a kid. I was in the same situation with my first husband. I had 2 kids with him. I left him when my oldest was 4 and the youngest was 2. Now they are 10 and 8. They have asked me that question and I assured them that none of it was their fault. Although I was beat, I did not tell my children that. I just told them that we were not happy with eachother and dedcided to break it off. The older they got, the more detail. Now, they are satisfied with the answers I gave them without telling all, have remarried and love my husband as if he was their real dad even though they both know he's not. I never dog their dad even though he was one, but if he is a dead beat dad don't try to make him look good cuz then he will think you are keeping him from something special. Let him know who his dad is for what he is and that's it. Good or bad. Just try to find you a hunny that will love you and your boy unconditionally. Let him grow up with him so that he is all he knows. That way when the time comes for you to answer it hopefully will not be a big deal cuz he loves his "daddy". I kinda feel like I'm rambling. Sorry, but best wishes to you.|`|LUD8Ge9Naa	let him know when he asks you and tell him mommy and daddy did not get along and that you guys had to go your separate ways.|`|N0EHtPKsaa	You have to be honest. Tell him daddy was mean to mommy, so daddy left. It will hurt, but if you lie... they'll hold that over your head forever!|`|sKfDUAcvaa	Tell him his dad went to college.
TFmKNu24aa	I'm in the same boat as you are. I love my Husband with all my heart, and I would do anything for him. Although the mother is using her issues against you, or perhaps against the relationship itself  - that doesn't mean that you have to put it out towards your love one. Despite her mother is depressed, alone, bitter, and in distressed that doesn't mean that the love that you have for one an other should diminish. True Love will always be there to support you through good times, and bad times. Your Wife will be Forever there during this time while her mother, and you are going through a difficult time.<br>  <br>  In terms of being too attached, or by having space - I can't tell you what's the best solution because only the heart knows. I would say, have a day or two, or three to decompress. But, let your love one know, and feel that despite her parents treat her badly that doesn't mean that you won't be there for her. I know that you'll Forever be there for your Wife - and, I'm sure that she'll understand because I do. Being too attach is not a bad thing, but yet it's good to have time for yourself to decompress, and still be there for the person.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, I will always see you no matter what event occurred. I do understand that you need a few days to cool off - I am looking forward to see you on Thursday. True Love conquers it all - and, no matter what others are going through, and no matter how they affecting you, or the both of you. THE MAIN THING IS YOU HAVE EACH OTHER - WE HAVE EACH OTHER SLOUCHY FOREVER.<br>  <br>  Your Wife,<br>  <br>  Amanda.<br>  <br>  I forgot to add - be strong, and let's be strong together. Like you said "never loose faith" - with True Love, and with you that doesn't even cross my mind. REMEMBER - STARTING AT FOREVER, AND ENDING AT NEVER.|`|bUDcM8Q3aa	Been there done that. You have to focus on the relationship you have with your wife first of all. Secondly you need to fix the issues, not shut them out. Shuting them out only makes it worse in the long run. Why do the mothers hate your spouse so much? If you get to the root of the issue and try to resolve it you will be better for it. You dont do your relationship any good by calling her mom names even if you feel that way, trust me you might be her husband but the mother is always the mother. Did you ever stop to think its not a control thing that its an issue of simply letting go? If I were you Id start by talking to your mom and finding out her issues with your wife and the same for your mother in law and then share your findings and try to work on one thing at a time. Not changing your self per say but maybe takeing a different perspective on what you hear your mother in law saying and attending to it. I tried it and it has been nice and quiet for the most part for nearly 3 years now after 12 years of marriage and ten kids. Hang in there and just remember fighting with family is a lose lose for all. Just focus on what you and your wife can make right in the moms eyes and then build from there.|`|4gZYucHMaa	Your wife needs to get to a counsellor/support group to let go of her anger. She's deflecting what she feels to her mom to you bc she knows you love her, whereas with her mom she knows she cant let it all lose, she's afraid of the answer.<br>  <br>  She needs to get to a person other than you and talk|`|ngkNaQJeaa	Me and my husband are in the same situation, my mom hates him, his mom hates me. we understand the constant bickering and annoyance! <br>  my husband asked me before, how is it that your mom is a B**** and you turned out so wonderful? <br>  dont take it out on your wife. me and my husband have to shut our mothers out of our life, we keep our communication to the minimal, maybe we will awkwardly say hello once in a while.<br>  it got so bad where my mother in law came to my house pounding on my door. i locked it and so she called my husband to tell me to open the door. my husband told her to go away. i had to call the cops on the woman, finally after a couple of months she left us alone. <br>  <br>  sometimes you have to fight the evil battle of mother in laws:(<br>  the best thing to do is sit down with your wife and explain to her how it affects you. good luck with the monster in law!
