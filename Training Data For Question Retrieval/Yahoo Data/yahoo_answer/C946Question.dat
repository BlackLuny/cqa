20090129044415AAL5eAq	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	(UK) Best way to invest ￡10,000?	I live in England. I have been given almost ￡10,000, which I hope to use towards a deposit for a house in a couple of years.       In the meantime I need to put it somewhere safe. I would like it to earn SOME interest, even if it's not much. I don't want to invest it in anything high risk, because I'd rather earn minimal interest than come out with less than I put in.      Where is the best place to invest this sort of cash?       I am looking into ISAs, but obviously you can only put up to ￡3,600 into it annually. I hope to get one opened before the end of the tax year, so that in April I can deposit a further ￡3,600. That would leave me with around ￡2,800 to put somewhere else.      Are there any high interest bank accounts around at the moment? I'm happy to lock my money into the account for up to 2 years, but anything longer than that I can't guarantee, as it would depend on our living situation.      I've read a little on www.moneysavingexpert.com, but the information can be a bit vague. I was wondering if anyone knew on the top of their head a good account to go for...

20090129043449AAQd3GP	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Problems with housemates!!!!!?	Long story but when i moved in a year ago to a student houseshare and i had taken over another girls room.i paid one months rent as a deposit for the room which the three people agreed they would keep my deposit and give me a contract which i have never seen to this day. Over the last year we have had major problems with the landlord over house repairs and rent which has lead the other housemates to believe that they wont get their deposit back from the landlord.       However, as i am moving out next month and asked the housemates about getting my deposit back from them beforehand or to just take it as my last months rent, they have all decided (their all best friends) that it is unfair that they may not get their deposit back but i will and because the landlord doesnt have mine and they need to discuss it with the landlord who may i ad doesnt even know that i paid a deposit to them as far as he is aware.      So at the moment i have one month left there and i dont have any contract or receipt to back myself up with and it is stressing me out

20090129054420AAsiTQJ	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Am I  wrong? If you click on any of the foreign countries listed do you get answers from people in that countr?	It is confusing  to me when people from foreign countries do not go to the countries listed at the bottom of each page for their answers, rather than the US section.  Especially for financial questions that have laws and regulations different than the USA and applying only to that particular country. I once worked for a number of years for a large mortgage lender with offices all over the world. None of the  loans that were not originated in the US could be underwritten in the US because the guidelines and what was necessary for approval were not the same as here. Those loans had to be underwritten in the country where they were originated. It concerns me when questions in, for instance,   Australia, India or England, are answered in the section for America. Am I  wrong in assuming  that the foreign question section is more likely to be answered from someone from that particular country ? It concerns me that foreign questions are getting incorrect information from people in the US.

I have been trading and investing in stocks for many years, but I still have a question that I hope somebody can answer.   The number of companies in the market is growing everyday more and more raising the number of outstandig shares to trillions.   A single company can also make second offerings diluting that way the value of its stocks.   If this process of endless dilution doesn't end, and it looks to me like it'll never end, why would stocks be worth anything in the future?

20090129062516AAsKGxa	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	How is this Beta Business Plan sounding to you, Mr./Ms. Expert?	In all accounts, I am a rookie who is, in the near-future, about to dive into the risky entitlement of business ownership.      This is going to be a purely E-Commerce Business, that is, until profits rise high enough where I am able to purchase a massive building... the H.Q.      I have a general business plan which will only become more specific as the day of judgment, Day One, approaches. I intend to use my own funds to start this movement ((when I obtain roughly about $4,000 from my current job))... I already have a good coding expert on my side, who happens to be my good friend. I also have my other friend who is majoring in accounting.      They will be my partners in crime as this company begins to take off; My Coder handling the Behind the Scenes work ((updating the website with goodies and whatnot)) and my Accountant handling the funds and sales records. I myself am concerning myself with customer representation ((one of my top top top priorities ^_^)), optimism, goal setting, legalities ((need to find a lawyer)), third party deals, vendor relationship, etc.      I have a lot to learn, but I'm quite confident I shall be successful.       I don't really intend to seek Angel Investors, or whatnot, in the beginning, since I feel $4,000 for an e-commerce business + the funds from my current job, will suffice. Only when I start seeing profits, as well as get a feel for the business and people, coming in will I seek to expand the empire... but, only when things are stabilized.      Once the investors come a knocking, or vise-versa hehe, will I then begin to reach around all corners and blocks, being ever vigilante to the changes that may go on around me.      I'm leaving a lot out, but for now... what do you think? Do not hold back any criticism, so long as it's constructive. :)

Each 10 gm of Nutrilite Protien powder gives 8g of protien. Protien is one the most important components in the human body and it is needed daily to maintain good health. As the human body cannot store protien easily, the supplementary diet like nutrilite in our daily diet helps to maintain good health. It comes in 200g, priced at Rs.779/- and 500g priced at Rs.1609/- To purchase this nutrilite one has to be a distribtor of Amway or should purchase it from an Amway distributor. The way I used to take nutilite is I mix it with wheat flour and make rotis, or mix it with dosa batter or mix with vegetables. I find it very difficult to drink when it is mixed direcly with the milk. It becomes very heavy. The major disadvantage is the price.

We told them they needed to give us a $500 security deposit as well. They would not sign the agreement or pay us. So now, basically we have squatters living in our house. They are not technically renters so it seems like it would be wrong to have to go through the whole 30 day eviction process. Does anyone have any ideas about what is done in a situation such as this?

20090129064954AATcdWg	Business & Finance;Corporations	Can my company refuse to pay me my contracted hours?	I'm currently working full time at a hotel in the food and beverage department. As we all know the recession is in full swing and things are running a little slow at my work.      There have already been some redundancy's and we were told before christmas that we would no longer be paid for any overtime. But recently, because there's been fewer people checking into the hotel, they have been cancelling some of my shifts and bringing me in later.      First they said I could make up the hours in the month (but it's obviously going to be impossible with the amount of hours Ive been cancelled), or I could take it as a holiday. I've refused to take any of my cancelled shifts as holidays cause I'm not using them up just to sit around at home when I'm more than willing to work.      I'm already on minimum wage and can't afford to be paid any less than my contracted hours. I have offered to work in any other departments if needed but they've not got back to me.      So back to the question. Can they refuse to pay me my contracted hours, even though I'm willing to work and through not fault of my own, they have failed to give me my contracted hours?

20090129040816AACcHjT	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Question about when I get my tax refund?	I e filed through H and R block free edition online on January 11th. My federal return was accepted on January 18th and my state return was accepted on January 23rd. It says you can check your status of your return 7 days after you file online. It has now been 11 days since my federal was accepted and 6 days since my state was accepted, but neither say they have any information on my return. They tell me to check my information and make sure it is right, but it is. The IRS refund chart says if your federal return was accepted between Jan 16th and Jan 22nd your return will be sent through direct deposit on Jan 30th. What could be the reason for my information not being on the website? Also if do not receive my return withing at least a week of the date saying it will be sent what can I do?

20090129060722AAgNwxe	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Ex claimed kids and ME on his taxes - help!?	I filed my 2008 taxes online yesterday and it got rejected. I spoke to a lady at the IRS and she stressed to get my paper return in the mail ASAP. Last year the same thing happened and I figured the ex put the kids on his return (I have full custody). When this happened last year, I filed a fraud form, sent letters to the IRS, including kids report cards, med records and statements from neighbors that the kids lived with me full time. All I ever got from the IRS was a letter stating I'd get my money in a couple weeks - it never arrived. The IRS lady today told me my idiot ex also claimed ME on his return last year...he filed jointly....he did not have my W-2s or anything and the IRS did not catch this. They also sent him the stimulus check I was entitled to.    BTW - this was done thru an H&R Block office. The guy told him to say the kids lived with him and he did not have to get some form signed off by me in order to claim the kids. Total BS, as the kids spend NO time with him. Ex has been unemployed almost a year. We are not getting child support and are getting food from or local food pantry. I am going to a local IRS office tomorrow. Pray we get help because my kids and I need our refund desperately. I do not understand how the idiot ex can put me on his taxes when I work and he does not have my W-2s - he put me in as 0 income. How can the H&R Block guy put this through? Why does the IRS not catch this? This is going to cause a HUGE problem for me in confronting him, as he is violent and I am afraid of him.
20090129064717AASQ5Gg	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Refund check put into bank account w/o my name?	Hi - thank you to the folks who offered advice and support (I am the person who asked about the unemployed ex fraudulently claiming ME and our kids on his taxes). I am so upset and scared, so you guys did help me! I still don't understand how the IRS did not catch that my w-2s were not on his false return, but...      It occurs to me that as he sneaked and filed us "jointly" the tax refund would be in both our names.  How did he get away with last year's refund getting direct deposited into HIS bank account - a bank I have never had an account with. Don't banks check to see that names on checks/deposits match account holders?  Would it help if I called his bank and asked them to block the deposit of this years return, as he is pulling the same stunt with the IRS and my name is not on his bank account?       To the person who asked if H&R Block disclosed about his return to me - no, but they are intentionally helping him to commit fraud - ex is not smart enough to do this on his own. Also as idiot ex put my name and SS # on the return I think HR could give me info.

I am very self-motivated and earn top grades.  I have a keen interest in biology and in human anatomy, but I don't know if I want to put in the 8+ years to become a doctor.  I also love english and history, writing and researching comes pretty natural to me.  I work well with kids.  I love animals (from domestic to wild).  Most importantly, I feel very passionate about humanitarian work.  I want to be able to help communitites in Africa or possibly work with an organization that does.  I definitely do not want to be cooped up in a cubicle all day, no 9 to 5 office job. Can anyone give me any suggestions?

20090128220132AAXmSM3	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Can you please please give me some career advice. I really need it. Thanks a lot!?	I have a keen interest in learning about new technologies and would love to be a part of something to do with technology. The only problem is that I don’t know what college major to pick. I’ve thought about computer science and have even gone to my friend’s computer science courses and find them REALLY boring. I don’t know about engineering either, it’s just too complicated and math oriented. I just know that I want a unique career in technology which will give me the opportunity to make some good money. I don’t want to go into software engineering, interactive media and graphic design though. Whenever I hear about new technologies such as cyborg, I get really excited. I love to build things. Someday I want to create something really great. I highly doubt engineering is for me since I never really got good grades in math all throughout high school. I also didn’t take chemistry or physics or anything in high school. Chemistry, physics and math doesn’t really interest me much, but I still want to do something that has to do with technology. Please suggest something to me. Thanks so much.

20090129060234AAgs1Tw	Business & Finance;Taxes;United Kingdom	PAYE & NI - consequences of non payment?	Due to hard times, my employer wants to avoid paying the PAYE & NI contributions for the company this month.  He proposes doing this by still paying staff their net pay, but from his own personal account, and declaring ￡0 in wages to the revenue, thus creating ￡0 liability.      He doesn't see that there's anything wrong with telling the revenue that all us employees agreed not to be paid this month.       My question is, what are the potential consequences of doing this, for us as employees? Will we be liable to pay the contributions later down the line if he gets found out? Surely our new tax codes for tax year 2009-2010 will then be incorrectly calculated? We won't have paid enough in NI for such things as state pension, JSA etc?      I'd be grateful if anyone can tell me officially where we stand on this please?

[This question was asked earlier, so no need to answer again if you did the first time round.]      I work 16.5 hours per week. I earn just over 90 pounds for that, I also get 115 in working tax credits. I get 92 pounds in housing benefit and free prescriptions. I live with my wife and we have no children. I 'earn' 297 pounds per week tax free because I'm below the threshold for tax.   That's approx 15k per year for 16.5 hours, if I worked full time I'd get approx 10k. Plus I'd have to pay full rent and council tax...      As a delivery driver at 42 I can't see my career going anywhere, so I'll not earn any more than I'm on now unless minimum wage goes up.       Would you consider me a scrounger?

20090129065911AAtbY0d	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Do I need a real estate agent for a short sale or can I do it myself? ?	I own a condo for the last three years.  I bought it for 290K, interest only arm loan.  I tried to sell it for two years with no luck, but at 290k.  It is now worth about 260k. I got married and bought another house with my wife.  We have four children.  I rent my condo out but it does not cover all the costs.  I am losing 10k a year on this property. I lost my job and  can not afford to keep it.  I want to sell it, but are concerned if I hire a real estate agent, then I will have to take a bigger loss on short sale and be taxed on an even bigger difference.   Would it be possible to do this myself?  Or would I be better just foreclosing on this?  My wife and I have a house, so I don't need credit right now...we live in Massachusetts. In Mass, can they come after deficiency?  or is Mass non -recourse?  I have one loan for this condo.  But it is considered a property investment, although that was never my intention.

That's $487.99 LESS than I actually paid, according to my pay stub.      Did the IRS make a mistake on my W2?  What is going on?      I know this is a lot of information.

I moved out of my apartment before the lease was up based on bad room mate situation even though my name was on the lease. Now that I am getting divorced and about to move out on my own for the first time, I am afraid that the eviction will hinder my chances of getting an apartment. I don't have time to pay it off since I have to move out right after the divorce is final in one month.    Is this a deal breaker with apartment complexes?

My issue is why does government pay more for time spent on the job than skill? Maybe this is why skilled workers go to the private sector. I have complained to management and their reasoning is I need more time on the job. I do as well or better than my colleagues and know just as much and because I am new I cannot get equal pay.

God help me if i wanted to claim property tax deduction b/c for some reason that added yet another $300 to my bill.  And just found out that the $600.00 stimulus check I got last year, yeah they are going to tax that.  So the government gave me money but then taxed me on it.

Im 17 right now, already working on university credits thru online studies at Athabasca U. and i still have no idea what i want to be!!       When i was about 3 my aunt gave me a doctor kit and i played with it quite a lot. So everyone said "oh look whos going to be the next doctor in the family" and when i was little i didnt know anything so i said, yeah ill be a doctor.       Ever since then it was either, hes going to make it to the NHL and make millions of dollars and if not he can always fall back on a doctor, they make good money too!  I never really had a say or was asked what i wanted to be.       about a month or 2 ago, i said i didnt want to be a doctor (having given up playing high end hockey, this was now going to be my job) because i dont really find it an apealing job, yes i like the pay, but i dont want to be stuck doing somthing i dont want to do. also the amount of schooling is insane!       But my mom said, well what do you want to be?   This kinda stumped me because..... i dont know... :S ive always had to be a doctor!

I think I'm in desperate need of a "mental health day" because it seems that the few things I've had to deal with here today are annoying the Hell outta me!      First, my supervisor asks me to revise a document for him per the instructions of one of the workers. I do as I'm told and he then shows the document to the worker's supervisor and has me revise it AGAIN. Why didn't he just ask the supervisor beforehand to save me from having to revise twice?       Then, one of my co-workers gives me a transmittal for something that needs to go out but I notice that the company name is wrong. I asked him to fix this at least 2 times in the past. So I have to e/m him to ask him to revise it and cc: our supervisor just in case it's not done.       Why do I have to do things more than once and/or get on top of ppl to do THEIR jobs? It makes no sense to me. I know what my tasks are and I do them on time. Is it really that hard or am I just having a bad day and I'm mad at the world? lol

20090129072808AA8cHh7	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Should I let my rental property go into foreclosure?	I purchased my house a few years ago as a fixer-upper and it is in my name solely.  I then met my husband a year later and I moved into his larger/nicer home.  My husband who is skilled as an auto-industry machinist was laid off 5 months ago and is still unemployed and looking for work.        I currently rent my home out (but I still have to shell out $300 a month to cover the mortgage).  I was notified that my renter will be vacating my rental property once his lease runs.  I know I will not be able to find a renter willing to pay the same rental amount and I cannot afford to lower the rental rate because I cannot not afford to make up the difference.  I currently pay the mortgage and 2nd mortgage on the home we’re currently living in (and credit card and medical bills) and my husband’s unemployment covers our utilities and other necessities.        Since I purchased my home the comps in my area have decreased drastically and similar homes are selling for $25,000 LESS than what I owe on my rental property mortgage.  So I’m very upside down on my loan.  In addition, there are 10 foreclosed properties in my neighborhood that are selling for between $50,000-$60,000 less than what I owe on my mortgage.  I know I will be unable to sell the home for the price I owe on the mortgage.  In actuality I would only be able to sell it for half of what I owe on the mortgage, even if I did find a buyer as it is still a fixer upper and needs a lot of work.        I don’t want to file bankruptcy so I am considering letting the rental property go into foreclosure.  How long does a foreclosure stay on your credit report and how long does it usually take for the bank to actually take possession of the home once the loan is defaulted on?  Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks.

20090129072944AAoQBaH	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	My relatives want me to go into Nursing but I think differently..?	So here's my story. My 2 aunts and my grandmother want me to go into nursing because I'm good in science, I'm a nice patient person, etc. etc. But I wanted to go into Psychology or Journalism, preferably Psychology. Now since I started high school i''ve had time to think about it and now I'm attending my second semester of CC. I've done all my research and reading and of course I know that nurses make more money and are always in high demand but, I went into the field for them, to make them happy and because of the money. It's not what I want to do. I know a career psychology is only good if you go to get your Master's Degree but it's what I want to do, and if I tell them that they'll yell and fuss at me like they always do because I didn't do what they wanted me to do. I don't wanna go into a field where I know I'll be miserable and unhappy and I know they won't respect my decision. My mother does but she may be the only one. And I when I attended the few nursing classes this past week, I knew for sure I didn't want to go into it. What should I do?

20090129073402AARKGw3	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	EEOC charges, EEOC investigation?	11 months ago (Feb 08) I reported my immediate boss for harassment, and while at the meeting HR told me that they could either "file away my complaint" or look into it, I of course, told them that I wanted an investigation done.       After 3 months of "investigation" HR decided to support the executive that I work (I work for the very poweful privately owned company).  Because my boss had not stop his conduct during this time, I made the difficult decision to file a report with the EEOC (May 08).         After presenting evidence (same evidence that I also presented to HR) it was concluded that I had grounds to file harrassment charges based on SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN and RETALIATION.      While the EEOC's investigation process was going on (the company declined mediation), I decided to consult with several attorneys, three to be exact, and they all concluded that I had a case.  I however, decided to wait for the final EEOC report.        It has been almost 9 months since I filed charges with the EEOC and at the present time I'm still working for the same company and under the supervision of the same person that has done the harrassment, even after numerous verbal and writen requests on my part to get a transfer.      My last contact with the EEOC was in late December when I was told my file was being reviewed (I'm thinking perhaps they concluded with the investigation), however, to date my calls to find out about the status of the case are going un-answered and I'm not sure what to do.      Is this time frame normal?  Should I just sit tight and wait for their final determination?

I am a senior in high school who is stuck on deciding which major is right for me. I'm interested in different business fields like marketing and accounting and always love to travel, the thought of meeting people, being seen and known and dressing professionally in business attire. Also, I dreamed of working in a big building and possibly owning one. Every career quiz I take says the business fields or the government fields are best for me but I am stuck between which one. I want a high paying career and I want to put my brain to work but at the same time I want excitement and not the same thing everyday. I have dreamed of being on television or doing something that catches people eye. Also, I thought about the medical field.

It needs new windows is pretty much the jist of it. The listing price is 59,900. My dad and girlfriend want me to make my first bid of 45,900 but some people tell me not to go that low that the seller might just not want to sell to me after that or not want to budge on the listing price.

You have to donate R50 (about $5) to each of these persons. Then you will be given the password of the doc and you can then replace the first name on the list with your name, bank details etc. and forward the mail to allot of people.

20090129082618AADyL0m	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	How do you deal with businesses that don't care? And can be ruthless?	I've had to deal with various businesses out there that just simply do NOT care. They also can be ruthless about getting YOUR money,but when it comes to services, customer relations etc, they just don't care and "yep , yap, yupp, " and give you the run arounds.      From hair salons, to car mechanics and body shops, to hospitals, to larger corporations,       From important management positions, down to the lower positions, many people just seem to not care, and the whole business then represents that, and they come across like they don't care either.         I've dealt with a car repair place that I was acutally SENT to to repair my car. They overcharged me on the repair price, ignored my warantee for the part, automatically put me in their schedule books for a future appointment against my knowledge and will, recommended that I spend even MORE on things THEY think should be done, which didn't even need to get done, and just were generally unfriendly, jaded, and kept giving me "k, k k, yep," answers.      Then we have the hair salon I went to, where they almost treat me like the enemy. They treat me like I'm not to be trusted, and that I must go in...pay, and tip well, and then they give me their fake "bye bye's", and it's all just so fake and untrusting; then we have nurses/doctors at hospitals who act so "okay so..hi u ok? what do u do? where do u work,...yea u CAn die from that..ok just sit there, hush, well be back," and they dont even care, they can be sloppy with their jobs..."oops, missed a vain, have to poke ya again,"..bla bla bla...         I mean, I just feel like I can't trust many people and businesses now because of all of this, and I'm not sure how to effectively deal with them either.      Any advice?

My friend was telling me that she didn't get her w-2 forms yet and she moved last year and is afraid it went to the wrong address. She wants to file like now cause she needs the money so she doesn't want to wait to get a copy from her employer b/c they would have to mail it from corporate. She tried to access it online at w2express.com but is getting no luck, any other ideas?? She was saying she was going to use last year's w-2 forms cause she has it and said she probably made 'about the same' but I dont think that's legal. please advise. What if she had the last paystub for the year - will the company's EIN be the same?
