I'm curious to know how to approach women in the Philippines and what the dating scene is like.  I am Filipino (but born and raised in the U.S.)  How is the dating scene different in the Philippines as opposed to the U.S.?      I've heard from people (mostly aunts and other relatives) that girls in the Philippines are conservative when it comes to dating.  Is this really true, I think that might have been true in the past but not these days.        If dating in the Philippines is different from the U.S. how should I approach a woman differently?  How are the clubs and bars as opposed to other spots to meet women?  And if a girl is reluctant to speak english or doesn't talk much should I just take that as a sign that she isn't interested or is she just shy?  In general, how are women in the Philippines different from the women in the U.S.?      I know that things are a lot different in the Philippines as opposed to the U.S. so any information would really be helpful.

I am stationed in Alaska and I am deploying to Iraq in a few months.  My family is going home to Illinois for an extended vacation while I am deployed.  We are planning on traveling through Canada to get to the lower 48.  Now, we know we don't need passports but will the border patrol deny us because my husband has a felony.  The felony is due to stealing less than $200 from a friend's house but he was convicted shortly after turning 18 and the court wanted to make an example out of him.  He only got 2 months with probation.  He is now 29 and he has not been in any other trouble.  Is there a way to figure out how to know before we drive to the border?  This is our only option to get home we can't fly because we need a vehicle at home and we can't take the ferry because of timing and money.
