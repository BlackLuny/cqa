ji7gqCWxaa	Fly a Cessna!       How To Whistle Loudly    What you'll need:    Your fingers, washed (if you're starting a practice session)   A mirror (optional)   Practice 5 minutes a day in the mirror, and you'll have it in a few weeks (at the most)    Terms to know:    Bevel: a sharply angled edge which air flows over and produces a tone. In the case of a whistle, the sound is created by the upper teeth and tongue forcing air on to the lower lip and teeth.   Sweet spot: the bevel's area of maximum efficiency, where the air is blown directly over the sharpest part of the bevel. Once you locate the sweet spot, your whistle will have a strong, clear tone, as opposed to a breathy, low-volume sound.   You'll be shown two techniques for whistling: one that uses your fingers, and another that doesn't. Say it's raining, your arms are full of shopping bags, and you need to flag a taxi. This no-hands whistle will allow you to emerge victorious in this situation and others. But the fingerless whistle is a little trickier to master, so you should practice the fingered whistle first. Just practice a little bit every day; soon pets and taxis alike will be at your beck and call.    Familiarize yourself with the different parts of your mouth, and get a feel for how they work together. It's mostly a matter of practicing whenever you get the chance: for example, walking a dog, applauding a live performance, or...flagging down a taxi.     If you can't produce any sort of whistle at present, maybe just loud wheezing sounds, you may want to try the fingered whistle first. Some say it's easier than the "no-hands" technique; others say they are equally easy (with practice.)     If you've set aside time to practice (highly recommended) then wash your hands first. It's good to be picky about what you put inside your mouth.     Method 1: Fingered Whistle  Tuck away your lips  First, your upper and lower lips must reach over to cover your teeth and be tucked into your mouth. Only the outer edges of your lips are visible, if at all.     1.) Choose your finger combination  The role of fingers is to keep the lips in place over the teeth. Experiment with the following combinations to discover which works best for you, depending on the size of your fingers and mouth. Regardless of your choice of fingers, their placement is the same: each are placed roughly halfway between the corners and center of lips, inserted to the first knuckle. (Again, this will vary depending on the size of your fingers and mouth.)    Your options are:    a U-shape created with thumb and middle finger, or thumb and index finger, of either hand.   right and left index fingers.   right and left middle fingers.   right and left pinkie fingers.   Now that your fingers are in place, be very clear on these two matters of form:    Your fingernails should be angled inwards, towards the center of the tongue, and not pointed straight in and towards the back of your mouth; and   your fingers should pull the lower lip fairly taut.   2.) Draw back the tongue   Now comes the crucial part of the whistle.     The tongue must be drawn back so that its front tip almost touches the bottom of the mouth a short distance behind the lower gums (about 1/2 inch/1 cm). This action also broadens and flattens the front edge of the tongue, allowing it to cover a wider portion of the lower back teeth.     The sound is produced by air flowing over a bevel, or a sharply angled edge. In this case, the sound is created by the upper teeth and tongue directing air onto the lower lip and teeth.     3.) Blow   Steps 3 and 4 follow each other very closely, if not simultaneously. Inhale deeply, and exhale over the top side of the tongue and lower lip, and out of your mouth. Some extra downward and outward pressure by the fingers onto the lips and teeth may be helpful. Experiment with the position of the fingers, the draw of the tongue, the angle of the jaw, and the strength of your exhalation. Adjusting with these will bring success.     Start off with a fairly gentle blow. You'll produce a whistle of lower volume at first, but you'll also have more breath to practice with if you don't spend it all in the first three seconds. As you blow, adjust your fingers, tongue and jaws to find the bevel's sweet spot. This is the area of maximum efficiency, where the air is blown directly over the sharpest part of the bevel. Once you locate the sweet spot, your whistle will have a strong, clear tone, as opposed to a breathy, low-volume sound.     Listen for these sounds: as you practice, your mouth will learn to focus the air onto the bevel's sweet spot with increasing accuracy. You'll probably hear the following: a breathy, low-volume tone that suddenly, as you adjust your fingers, mouth, or jaw, will switch to a clear, full, high-volume tone. Success! You're on the right track--your task now is to reproduce the mouth and hand position that led to the better whistle.|`|TPCFxRqQaa	i wish i can for once smile from the heart and have a good day without feelin the need to jump in front of moving vehicles.      seems easy for others but for me its a constant internal struggle|`|wbJXqkVGaa	cooking;-p|`|FDjn05cNaa	Be fluent in Arabic ...even if my accent wasn't any good !|`|79nC5n4Daa	ski|`|KrqGoxoUaa	me too!!!|`|d72zw1nQaa	Change my handwriting.|`|LGesuIM8aa	I wish I could do backflips.|`|qrRGbiBvaa	I wish I could play and instrument really well.

LPCfOtiKaa	All these joksters. the West Edmonton Mall is NOT in Ontario! It is in Edmonton, which is a city in Alberta.    Vaughn Mills is a big mall, but it is NOTHING compared to the West Edmonton Mall (which actually has a population of homeless people who live in it because it's so freaking huge.)|`|1e517d457abe5a99863a757df71245e3aa	no, the West Edmonton mall in Ontario is the biggest mall in North America and the 5th biggest in the world.     It was the biggest mall in the world for 23 years. Up unitl 2003|`|n5FNbQRNaa	I hardly doubt there's enough space to expand it that much. Ontario is way cluttered as it is|`|l9c2Uw5baa	It might be one of the largest in North America, but it won't surpass the West Edmonton Mall - that place is massive!|`|XfjAwH7Haa	It might be true as it might have the most stores in north america. But it won't be the biggest. The Mall of America and West edmonton mall are the biggest in north America, but they have a crappy theme park and water park. Statistics prove that these malls are very hard to run a store in, West Ed says goodbye to 9 stores a month on Average.  West edmonton mall may be the biggest in Canada, bu the stores they have in there suck majorly. I much prefer yorkdale, sherway, eaton centre, and Vaughn malls and when I want to go to a theme park or water park, I go the Canada's wonderland with 15 coasters, not 2 crappy coasters.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	I thought it was finished...it's big, but not as big as the West Edmonton Mall....|`|bvzJ9hAbaa	No.  Even as simply a mall it is only of a size with several others in many parts of North America.  It might qualify as the biggest mall in Ontario, maybe, because some others like the Eaton Centre in downtown Toronto are pretty huge by the time you add up the four floors of shops there!
fIK9LBEuaa	1. No, you do not need a passport to cross the border VIA CAR yet. That only applies if you fly internationally. If you have a passport, then nothing else is needed to cross the border. If you don't have a passport, then bring a birth certificate, drivers license, and any other photo id that you have.    2. That depends on the area, and how busy the passport place is. But generally; 6 months is the time. It took about 4 to get mine.    3. No, you don't have to drive to take a bus across the border. Just make sure that you have either:  (a) a passport  (b) other I.D like a birth certificate, and a note from your parents if you are underage    4. That all depends on your planning and organization. If you do everything ahead of time, it shouldn't be to bad. But if you wait until the last minute, or play it by ear and see what happens, then it will be difficult. I would recommend finding one bus and taking it all the way.    Good luck! :)|`|1e517d457abe5a99863a757df71245e3aa	1. your passport should be all you need, possibly some photo ID.     the rest you should probably try asking in the US section|`|yJq1uqZ6aa	2. there are services that can get you a passport pretty quick.  i once got one for a lst minute trip to eurrope within 2 weeks (google express passport, and dont take my word for it, get it as soon as you can)    make sure no one you're traveling with has ever had a dui, they can be turned back
AA11466154	You might be able to get 4 people on a 7 day cruise but it all depends on where the cruise ship is going the more exotic the more expensive.|`|6936d268b8ae755b33097885ef951cf9aa	It all depends on how the length of the cruise you want to take and the type of cabin you choose.  The most inexpensive is an inside stateroom, followed by Oceanview, balcony and then suits.     Check out the link below (www.CruisesOnly.com) where you can get a full list of all available Carnival cruises and can sort them by price.     Best of luck!|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Each cruise is a different price.  Like airlines the price goes up and down with special rates.    Also each category of room has a different price.  Interior, Ocean view, Balcony, Suite.  If you want to determine your own room (Say 7th floor, aft, or even 7430) you will pay more.    Rooms are sold per person with double occupancy.  If you are adding people there are additional fees per person that also change.    A rough estimate is $200 per person but that's really rough estimate.  For a Caribbean cruise.  med cruises are more expensive.    If you had $3000--7 day cruise ocean view room is usually 100 per night per person.  So 1400 for two of you.  Additional two people 1600.    $3000 can also get a suite for 2 people and that's it.  For a med cruise, it can also be not enough for 2 people.  For an interior room, you can get prices as low as $300 on a special rate for past guests.|`|jBv0eBCNaa	I Got a Suit and a stateromm with two adults and four kids for $6.000|`|AuxlgxjBaa	Where are you going?  Inside berth or outside?  oceanview or suite? 3 day, 7 day, 10 day?  etc etc...Right now most cruise lines are offering 50/% off or two for one. Im going to Alaska on Princess Lines this August  7- day inside for 447.00|`|gPeEdjmuaa	It all depends on how you budget. If you spend wisely, do your homework, spend time finding the right deals, keep records of the price reductions and when they increase, then you can go on a 7 day cruise for 4 easily with that amount. Now, that's just paying for the boat, government taxes, port taxes, etc. If you plan on spending more money with excursions (booking through Carnival is usually double the price; although it does have perks. If you were to get lost or in an accident, the ship will wait for you before it departs. If you decide to book privately -much cheaper- than your taking a risk to be stuck there if something were to happen) Also, you can get the fountain card if your family is big soda drinkers, but that adds up easily too. If you drink alcohol, be sure to budget on that as well, that adds up! I have a friend who spent 3,000 dollars alone just on alcohol and shore excursions. So then again, you really have to be careful. Carnival is slick by giving you an option whether you have unlimited spending money on your card they give you (which needed onboard and offboard of ship) or you have another option of putting a deposit on the card so you can't overspend. My recommedation is to set aside a certain amount of spending money and don't go over it. I booked a 7 day carnival ocean view room for around 2,500 dollars for 4 people. It's not the cheapest, but family will all be attending, so it was worth it. We also didn't have to include airfare because we decided to drive the port. So maybe somewhere around that ballpark. Also here are some helpful sites:    http://vacationstogo.com    http://cruise411.com    http://cruisecritic.com    * vacationstogo is the best cruise site I have found (my personal favorite)    Good luck and enjoy your future cruise! :)

P0fcmrkSaa	Why does everybody think that Russia is teem with skinheads? Yes there're some... But it's not so common to meet them. In such big cities like St.Petersburg and Moscow there're so much foreigners! And also not with european face...   In my city where I live there're whole districts where live Chinese and people from caucasian countries... Also many persons from Kazakhstan, Uzbekhistan live or work here... I see them every day.   Many persons from Russian republics like Tartarstan, Bashkortostan and so on...also live here... from Yakutia... Skinheads do not like them all too. Even persons with dark skin live here. I've met them many times. The skinheads don't like even Russian persons who have unusual look... so.. if we see. Other persons are more numerous than skinheads...    If you are afraid even now...so the first: I haven't ever heard the skinheads to attack or kill a girl...maybe they can tell something...but I don't know  the second is....don't stay at night in some lonely dark areas... There you can be attacked not only by skinheads...and if it's day-time, many people around you... You think some nacist persons come to you and attack?? Of course not.  the third: I've seen them about 2 times...in all my live. And that persons were just stupid teenagers that want to look adults... They said much more than did.     It'll be ok.

If there are Arabs in the country that don't serve the country but their own agenda that hurts Israel, Lieberman will find them! And you know what? He found some. Go get them Lieberman!  He didn't murder them like Fatah and Hamas murder each other now did he?  So be quiet about that as Lieberman is doing his job.    As far as Hamas, those people voted in that terrorist regime.  We saw what Hamas did to Fatah.  What makes you think blockade is to do with elections and not with the violence? They are VIOLENT and bad people.     The elections were in 2006, the blockade started in 2007 after Hamas took over Gaza from Fatah. It is because of the violence. You think this is ok for Hamas and Fatah to do since they were "democratically" elected they can just do what they want? Nobody is democratically elected to murder their own people and attack another people in the country next door that is craziness.     Look, here they are murdering 14 year old daughter in the head and then her mother in the chest when mother tries to get the daughter. Is this what Hamas and Fatah were "democratically" elected for?    In another crime, 14-year-old Alaa Hamdi Farawana was killed and her mother was wounded while they were inside their house in Khan Yunis as bloody armed clashes erupted between militants from Fatah and Hamas movements. In her testimony  the childs mother,   35-year-old Sabreen Fathi Yousef Farawana, stated:  Our flat is located on the 3rd floor of an apartment building belonging to my family in the Sea Street in the center of Khan Yunis. At approximately 11:30 on Wednesday, 13 June 2007, while my daughter Alaa was taking dishes to the kitchen after we had  finished our breakfast, she was hit by a gunshot to the head coming through the western balcony. I attempted to help her, but I was wounded by a gunshot to the chest. We could hear sounds of shooting in the street in the context of clashes between Fatah and Hamas movements. The neighbors came immediately and evacuated us to the hospital. There, I was informed that my daughter died.    -------------    Look, here they use Al Quds hospital, to fire upon a Red Crescent humanitarian building, while hitting a civilian in a third civilian building in the crossfire, that is NOT ok. Is that what they were democratically elected for?    In another attack, a Palestinian civilian was wounded when he was inside the house of  Reem Khalil al-Souri, 28, near al-Quds Hospital in Tal al-Hawa neighborhood in the southwest of Gaza City. In her testimony al-Souri stated:  At approximately 15:30 on Wednesday, 13 June 2007, many militants deployed inside the headquarters of the Preventive Security Service, and some of them took position on the second and third roof of the building of Palestine Red Crescent Society opposite to our building, where I live on the first floor. An intense exchange of fire erupted between militants of Fatah movement and those of Hamas. We also heard sounds of explosions. On the following day morning, the fighting escalated and consequently, we were not able to move inside the house. We were 3 families comprised of 14 individuals, including 5 children. We all stayed in the southern part of the house, which was the most secure. Later, gunshots hit the house. We could hear glass of windows being broken and voices of militants. As a result of the gunfire, electricity was cut off. A few hours later, the fightingfurther escalated and we realized that armed clashes were taking place near our building. Militants from Hamas were deployed near our building and neighboring buildings, firingat members of the Preventive Security Forces positioned atop of al-Quds Hospital. At approximately 09:20, Sameer Ibrahim al-Jilda, 48, was wounded by a gunshot to the left leg inside our house. We called a doctor and woman who has some experience in first medical aid, who live in our buildings, and they offered him first medical aid. We called for ambulances, but ambulances were not able to reach the area. We told one of the militants that we needed an ambulance to evacuate the wounded man, but he told us to offer him first medical aid. The situation became more dangerous, and the part of the house in which we were sheltering was no longer safe. The fighting continued until 12:30. It ended with Hamas takeover of the headquarters of the Preventive Security Service. We then evacuated the wounded man in a civilian car to the Arab National Hospital in the east of Gaza City.

CKRtwea6aa	June in Delaware --- it can be 100 with 100% humidity or some days can be chilly. On the beach tends to be cooler until the ocean gets warmed up (late summer). The breezes blow the cool air off the water onshore. But the whole month of June really doesn't vary much, just hit or miss on hot or cool days. (mostly hot).

This is how we know it before.    Each entry point going to Makkah has a checkpoint. The checkpoint guards check the Iqama of the driver and each passenger inside the car.

uKWcgLLoaa	Maybe you mean VIEW Ridge? (And I'm not sure what "North Beach" is--there's a place called that in San Francisco, but not in Seattle!)    If you mean View Ridge, it's a nice, middle class neighborhood quite near to town without being right in the middle of things. Affordable housing, relatively quiet...a place you could get to know your neighbors and have access to some of the better public schools in the city.    Maybe "North Beach" means the area at the north end of Lake Washington? That would be Shoreline, Lake Forest Park, Kenmore....all nice, middle class neighborhoods. Suburbs all (but "close-in" suburbs. Good schools, mostly good neighbors--no major problems to deal with except perhaps the commute into Seattle.

Q3RqWHFsaa	No easy way. Father don't always love you as you love him.   The clue you have is too little to look for him in so many population of Japanese in Japan and too old as more than 15 years ago. Everything has been turned so quickly as time goes by.    If he really loved your mother and you, why he didn't register you officially as record and take you back to his home in Japan later? It seems he just played with your mother for fun. There are so many same stories between Japanese men and Asian young women I heard a lot of them again and again. I think he'd have had his own Japanese  or other real wife in Japan too. Unhappy Japanese illegitimate are not only you in the world.    Japanese male is not so often serious to keep loving foreign   second wife unmarried after her pregnancy. His desire is quite naturally rather just sexual relationship than affection for eternity. Sorry but it is the fact and reality.    If you have his full name in Kanji and the address and telephone number those days, all what you can do is just to employ professional private eye. It cots very much and won't guarantee to successfull result in the end. I suppose it'd be better that you just keep going by your own way. Sorry again. I know you surely have right to love him though.|`|AA10662056	That's very difficult. In Japan, personal information such as address and telephone number is strictly protected.

B3FBgxjEaa	Over the past decade, some 1,500 members of the community have made aliyah,      (IsraelNN.com) Israel's Interior Ministry has granted permission to the Shavei Israel organization to bring a group of 150 Bnei Menashe Jews from northeastern India on aliyah (immigration).    The Bnei Menashe claim descent from a lost tribe of Israel and some 7,200 of them reside primarily in the Indian states of Mizoram and Manipur, which border Burma and Bangladesh.    "We have been working on this for quite some time, and I am grateful to the Prime Minister's Office and the Interior Ministry for approving our request," said Shavei Israel Chairman Michael Freund, adding that, "With G-d's help, we will shortly bring the immigrants home to Israel."     Over the past decade, some 1,500 members of the community have made aliyah largely thanks to Shavei Israel, which assists "lost Jews" seeking to return to the Jewish people.     http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/N...    The Israeli cabinet has yet to formally discuss the issue of aliya of the 7,200 that still live there.

2EVoNHHbaa	The temperature in early March can vary--anywhere from the 30s to the 60s.  Snow is very unlikely, although there might be rain or freezing rain.      People dress pretty much the same as they do anywhere else in the U.S.  If you're a teen, jeans are pretty standard--pack a pair or two, and a nice outfit or two.  Take along some shoes that are good for walking, since you'll likely do a lot of it.  Forget about flip-flops and shorts--the weather will be too cold for them.  Long-sleeve tops will be good.  If you don't have a cold weather coat, take along a heavy sweatshirt and a sweater.  Outfits you can layer will be ideal, since the temperature can range a lot during a day.    Unfortunately you won't meet the President since the places you'll go as a tourist are places he's unlikely to be.  There is a slight chance you might see some other famous person, particularly if you take a tour of the US Capitol where you might see some Congressmen and Senators.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	usually it's in the 40s for highs and around freezing at night.
1cJjGNOBaa	Go to Centennial Park, walk around the lake and feed the ducks and then go check out the Parthenon- a full scale replica of the one in greece which was built for Nashville's centennial celebration over a hundred years ago. it's only about $3 to get in to the museum. Go hiking all the way around Radnor lake- it's absolutely beautiful and free. Go to the Nashville Zoo- I think it's about $13 and you can easily spend more than a half day there- especially if you have kids. We have one of the largest wooden play structures in the country there! Take the 2 mile walk around downtown- it starts at Fort Nashborough on 1st Ave. at Riverfront Park (on the CUmberland River across from LP Field where the Titans play) Follow the green line on the sidewalk as it takes you all around the most interesting parts of our historic downtown. You'll pass the historic and fun Wildhorse Saloon- go in for fried pickles and a free line dance lesson-, the Ryman Auditorium which was the original home to the Grand Ole Opry- go in for a tour for a small fee-, the Capitol building where 2 presidents are buried, and some great architecture. You'll also be close to The Country Music Hall of Fame which is about $15 to visit, but you can go to the fabulous gift shop for free. There are loads of civil war era mansions and platations to tour for a fairly nominal fee- belle Meade Plantation, Carnton plantation, Travellors Rest, Belmont mansion, the Hermitage which was Andrew Jackson's home, Mansker Fort, Rock Castle, etc. There is a great Farmer's Market which is free and lots of fun. It's on 8th Ave. From there you can also take a local tour on the Big Pink Bus with the "Jugg Sisters"! It's kind of pricey, but so much fun! Google it to find the times and make reservations. have fun here- it's the best town in the country!!!!

For one thing, Canada has mineral rights to everything underneath Canada. Other countries can't just take our resources, even if they managed to get them through long tunnels! For another thing, obviously such a tunnel could potentially be used for illegal smuggling or terrorist activity. Even if this guy's tunnel digging proclivities were innocent, no doubt Canadian authorities would be very alarmed for those reasons.|`|NvPIYdHoaa	If the border gard's find out they could arrest him for illegally crossing the border!|`|Rzs7rrbEaa	lmao you got me..can I help?|`|2wyDALHgaa	You are right, it's make believe though but if you want to look at it in a realisitic sense, private individuals who buy land in Canada, and in the US I believe as well, do not own either the airspace above the land and the area under the surface.  Thats why when you buy a house it says in the paperwork that you don't own the mineral rights and such.    SO, with that having been said, once he breaks that physical border between Canada and the US you "mole man" has entered Canada illegally and can be arrested and/or dealt with by Canadian law.  Keeping in mind they would have to either catch him in the act (dig to get him) or have sufficient evidence to have US authorities pick him up under one of the various MLAT's and extradite him to Canada for prosecution.    Also, regardless of who opened the hole, nature or him, it doesn't matter since HE is the one who crossed the border boundary illegally in the first place.
0KR4wyoQaa	Well if you're going soon (ie: this month or even next month), then it's not really that warm since it's still winter, so u might still need some light winter clothes.    As for the 4 day cruis along the Nile, I guess this is going to be in a hotel boat, so u can wear what u want in the boat, yes even swimsuits. (I've done this 4 day cruise thing (from Luxor to Aswan), and it was great.    But in general, u can wear what u want, but not too revealing, like no miniskirt, and preferably no cut, but tshirt is ok, and pants, or long shorts.    Maybe just in case if it rains bring an umbrella.    Hope this helps.    --------    Also yeah some important info: Don't swim in the Nile of course, it has lots of diseases, and lots of swirls and currents and stuff, and when visiting a mosque, take off your shoes.|`|0pM85b5Baa	Most probably you are visiting during winter. It's not so hot as you think during winter, it's warm and sometimes cool at night or the evening. In the south (Luxor - Aswan) it's warmer and the sun is stronger during the day and during visits, so try to wear a cap and drink enough water.     The Nile cruise is like hotel, you are free of course to wear anything you like there. You can wear swim wear one piece or bikini as you like. There will be a small swimming pool more suitable for children. Sunbathing would be interesting for you. Dress code will be applied during dinner in hotels and the boat, that's normal I think everywhere.     The best to wear should be suitable to what are you going to do. During visits to monuments, wear comfortable clothes and shoes. jeans may be appropriate.     For Mosques or churches, wear a scarf and not revealing clothes otherwise they may give a cover which you may not like.     In general during visits and in touristic places, it's the normal suitable clothes for the situation. In the streets or if you visit Khan El Khalily Bazar area, try to keep it not much revealing clothes. Same goes on all crowded and public places.

I'm guessing you'll be staying in tourist areas. It's okay to wear bathing suits. I'd wear a one piece, though. It's a good idea to keep your shoulders covered. Just dress modestly. I think you get the idea. In other words, no cleavage. And the girl above is right about the mosques. If it were me, out of respect, I'd wear long pants and sleeves, too, along with the head scarf.|`|ghMhb406aa	Well,,I think u should wear something appropriate ..

During climbing and hiking, wear jeans and cotton t-shirt.  Have some sweats too, as it could get cold in the evenings in the desert, if that's where you're going.  In general you can wear bermudas or pants and short sleeved t-shirts or blouses. When visiting the mosques and churches however,  you should have a shawl. Also expect to take off your shoes in mosques.   Yes you can swim wearing a swimsuit in the swimmingpool of the cruise along the Nile. No problem there.|`|KLv4OZMYaa	If you're going to mosques i highly recomend wearing a scarf and covering your legs (if not covered), i think they'll give you a scarf there.|`|hI1V3SB5aa	At this time of year it's not going to be hot, so you don't need to worry about that, the temperature in winter rarely breaks through the 25c barrier in the valley, even at the height of the day. At night it gets downright cold (around 10c)    The best thing for this time of year are jeans. Tough, warm, breathable, and nobody can claim to be upset. A loose cotton top with long sleeves to keep the wind off will serve you well, with a fleece or jacket for the mornings and evenings. A good pair of walking shoes is invaluable. Lightweight Hiking boots are useful, as is a light rucksack, preferably of breathable material to bring water, books etc. sunglasses are important, as the sun is very bright and the desert sites have a lot of reflected sun glare, hence some kind of sun block as well.    On the ship swimsuits are fine on deck, and at midday/early afternoon it's usually warm enough to soak up the sun for a few hours, but don't expect the full glory on the sun god at this time of year. Think along the lines of an average north European late June kind of weather.     It's worth taking a light headscarf to visit mosques. Touristic mosques often have them to give to visitors, but smaller ones won't, plus it's useful to keep the chill off at night or on an AC train/bus.

5bf3a310d6b6a11a26b378adb5b0e72daa	Generally, yes. Most of our annual precipitation falls as rain, much like your Pacific Northwest. Our climate isn't as extreme as yours, we have milder winters and cooler summers as a general rule of thumb. A bad summer's day can be almost identical to a good winter's day, i bet the same can't be said about New England!    Others have correctly mentioned that some areas get more snow than others, southwest England (excluding the moors) can go years with no snowfall or even an air frost in some places, while parts of Northern England and Scotland can get up to 2-3 feet of snow any time between October and May. Even so, most precipitation anywhere in the UK falls as rain, snowfall and freezing temperatures usually only temporally break up the monotony of wind and rain for a few weeks of the year.|`|bxlYleZkaa	No, snow is not a rarity here. I happens every winter. Ignore what you read or hear in the media. It can snow anytime between November and Easter.|`|1yGDFTieaa	It very rarely snows in England and when it does, a short while after it rains - so we're usually just left with a brown load of slush.    I'd say no more than a few centimetres which quickly melts. That's why when it snows in England we all go crazy with our sledges and begin building snow people!|`|wZYs1Nz6aa	Snow is a rarity in England, especially London. That's why everyone tends to go a bit mad when it does actually snow. I'm from Scotland, where snow is a bit more common, but we rarely get snow like we've been having the last few days!|`|RGEsfb5waa	in the south of England, like London, there is not much snow, but further North, heading into the Pennines in England, and into Scotland, snow is more common    but what we have had over the past few days, is more than what we usually get.    Where i am in the pennines, it will snow maybe 5 or 6 times over winter and usually leaves 3-6 inches normally, which will melt over the next few days, before the next one comes.    The weather here is unpredictable, and all winter the temperature is up and down, and it never settles into a pattern|`|GjsLzmNAaa	It very rarely snows here, most the time it's still cold and miserable weather.. like wind and rain and when we do get summer it doesn't last for too long.

Ok?       Sincerely yours.
QK4r41Hqaa	I'm really happy with yesjapan.com  you pay monthly, so it's not super expensive. The site is really great (the drawing illistrations are creepy. ignore them XD) and there's lots of vidoes that help teach you as well!!!    It is great for sentance structure, I think. After a while it starts introducing Hiragana, then Katakana, and I assume Kanji even. Unfrortunatly there's no way around it.   But you can look over allthe lessons and just read over the grammar section.  ^-^'      i have found the site to be extreamly great, and I trust them i nthat the lessons are correct.  And they do not teach the rediculous formal speach that some classes do.  My aunt took formal classes, but her coworker told her just not to talk cause it was so formal she talked strangly XD  She only knew the super-formal way of speach that isn't usually used    i'm sorry for all the typoes, my words are all jumbled up :(  I'm on a new keyboard... and I'm typing to fast..  sorry|`|AA10882951	sometimes you don't always have to learn it by a learning video.  sometimes it ish fun to learn it by watching a bunch of anime. they usually always have a phrase they like to repeat. then you will always remember it that's how I learned Japanese.

In my opinion, Nebraska, Kansas, and Alaska have some of the nicest people, and Wisconsin and Minnesota are right up there with them. I've lived in California my whole life, but my dad, brother, and I have done road trips every summer since 2004. Last summer we drove to Wisconsin. People always ask me, "Where are you from?" and I say "California" and that is followed by either a sour look or "Oh...then why aren't you blonde?" and I'm like uhh, wtf?|`|05ro4YOtaa	I'm thinking you're wearing a parka with cheese in the pockets.  Nothing wrong with that.
d8876255c27f26ef43eeab619d5cc580aa	I Absolutely love the Renaissance!! Especially their private island..only 5 minutes from the hotel (small skiff picks you right up in your lobby). I really would not consider the all-inclusive plans that are offered. The reason being is that food is very expensive (it's all imported) and all inclusive plans are very very expensive...so unless you eat a great deal it really isn't worth it. Plus if you have small children you will not benefit from all inclusive. I would "pay as i go" for food. Oh, and a comment about missing girl and the treatment her family received?? Well, look in the US murders happen daily in the hundreds and victims do not always get treated the way they should here either. Remember, murder and kidnapping is extremely rare in Aruba....your chances of that happening in the US are far greater. Enjoy your time in Aruba!! I love it there, soon to be traveling my 4th time and staying at Ren.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	I don't know about all-inclusive, but I stayed at the Hyatt Regency and it was fabulous.  Food wasn't included in the price, but it was half price for guests when I was there last June and it was outstanding.  By the way, this isn't just my own personal opinion.  The Travel Channel listed it as one of the 10 best resorts in the entire Caribbean.|`|ncojw5ttaa	I stayed at the Westin last October. It had just been renovated and was beautiful and clean. The rooms are luxurious and the beds are extremely comfortable. Each room has a balcony. We opted for a room with a view which cost slightly more, but worth it to be able to walk onto the balcony and see the ocean. Also we signed up beforehand as Starwood preferred guests and got to stay on the preferred guest floor (higher with a better view).    The trip cost us $1600 each for all-inclusive (food and drinks). Definitely worth it since Aruba can be expensive. They have a buffet for breakfast with everything you can imagine, a nice beach-side lunch spot, and 5 other restaurants (including Italian, Japanese, steakhouse/fish). They also have a romantic dinner on the beach at sunset, very intimate. There's also a casino, dinner show, beach-side tiki bar, spa, pool, etc.    The Westin also has it's own beach, which is right there when you walk outside. The staff is very accommodating. They offer a number of water sports (non-motorized sports are included in all-inclusive).    I will definitely stay there again. I know a lot of people that stay there and love it.    Westin:  http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/pro...  http://specialoffers.starwoodhotels.com/...    The Official Tourism Website of Aruba:  http://aruba.com/    Enjoy your trip!!!|`|NllWkSDiaa	The best all inclusive is the RIU or Renaissance, if your on a budget the Holiday Inn is affordable.|`|7tX1dX5waa	the renaissance casino or ocean suites, divi village, marriott ocean club, and the radisson|`|ZFFLhRtaaa	No offense but after the way the Aruba's government treated the lady that lost her teenage daughter there I would not spend a second there is trip were free.

c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	They love to kill me on this board because I'm a Bavarian who loves the German capital, Berlin. I lived there for seven years, and in my humble opinion, it is the best city in central Europe regarding culture, nightlife, and all kinds of fun. Try flying into TXL (Berlin-Tegel), that's loctated "center city" whereas BLN or BRB is out in the sticks. Berlin is great for it's museum island, the historical museum out in Dahlem (with the famous mask of Cleopatra), and lots of scientific ehibitions. With churches and cathredals, you'll probably not do so well in Berlin, but a cruise on the river Spree can show you some kind of history "not so long ago", like where the "iron curtain" once was. It's an interesting thing to see.|`|2rjwntWbaa	If you wanna see the Blackforest, fly to Stuttgart.  Frankfurt is a very modern big city, so you can fly there.  Berlin has lots of history and is HUGE, you can also fly there.  Munich of course has it's own bavarian flair with lots of things to do. REally i dont think you can do  more than 1 city in 4 days. depending on what you guys like, ie museeums, theme parks, outdoors, clubs, that would be a factor.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	To get the most bang for your buck, the barkeep at a place I went to in Garmisch told us to go to Berlin.  But, Munich has Dachau about 25 km from the city center.  Then you can see the Crown Jewels of Munich and also the Glock.  So...have fun.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Don't go to a concentration camp, they are the most depressing places ..... I went to Dachau near Munich, never again.    I'd say Munich is your best bet. Try www.hostelworld.com for accommodation, and it is actually quite handy to get the public bus from the airport into the city centre. Plus Munich has all the things you're looking for, as well as a good suburban rail network.

6F2diLGUaa	I actually prefer Sedona to the Grand Canyon. Jerome is fun too. That is, if you are looking for a day trip or one-night trip. Staying closer to home, why not go on a family hike in the desert? Usery Mountain Park is awesome and you could even bring a picnic. Another great day trip - go to Tucson and the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum.

Barcelona, Spain has many street statues, a landmark which if i remember rightly is called Gaudi    Paris, France has the Eiffel tower and great shopping places    Berlin, Germany I believe has the Berlin wall and is also a great place to shop    Amsterdam, The Netherlands is most famous for its red light district, legal drugs etc (they sell space cakes in cafes and weed is legal)    Also try Rome, Italy or Austria (I believe many go sking there)

Also the beaches are cleaner in SD, but I would have to say that Huntington in LA is a very nice beach very clean stay away from Newport Beach it's very dirty. huntington has a lot of shops and bars  for night life... and the hotel and motel are not that much  for a 2 bedroom suite... have fun|`|2uWES9Agaa	San diego|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	While Los Angeles has many more things to see and do than San Diego it is also more expensive.

And through the darkness of unbelief, he descends to the lowest of the low and falls to a position fit for Hell. For belief connects man to the All-Glorious Maker; it is a relation. Thus, man acquires value by virtue of the Divine art and inscriptions of the Dominical Names which become apparent in him through belief. Unbelief severs the relation, and due to that severance the Dominical art is concealed. His value then is only in respect to the matter of his physical being. And since this matter has only a transitory, passing, temporary animal life, its value is virtually nothing. We shall explain this mystery by means of a comparison:    For example: among man's arts, the value of the materials used and that of the art are entirely different. Sometimes they are equal, sometimes the material is more valuable, and sometimes it happens that five dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art is worth a million while the material of which it is composed is not worth five cents. And so, if such a work of art is taken to the antiques market and related to a brilliant and accomplished artist of former times, and announced mentioning the artist and that art, it may be sold for a million dollars. Whereas if it is taken to the scrap dealers, the only price received will be for the five cent's worth of iron.Thus, man is such an antique work of art of Almighty God. He is a most subtle and graceful miracle of His power whom He created to manifest all his Names and their inscriptions, in the form of a miniature specimen of the universe. If the light of belief enters his being, all the meaningful inscriptions on him may be read. As one who believes, he reads them consciously, and through that relation, he causes others to read them. That is to say, the Dominical art in man becomes apparent through meanings like, "I am the creature and artefact of the All-Glorious Maker. I manifest His mercy and munificence." That is, belief, which consists of being connected to the Maker, makes apparent all the works of art in man. Man's value is in accordance with that Dominical art, and by virtue of being a mirror to the Eternally Besought One. In this respect insignificant man becomes God's addressee and a guest of the Sustainer worthy of Paradise superior to all other creatures.However, should unbelief, which consists of the severance of the relation, enter man's being, then all those meaningful inscriptions of the Divine Names are plunged into darkness and cannot be read. For if the Maker is forgotten, the spiritual aspects which look to Him will not be comprehended, they will be as though reversed. The majority of those meaningful sublime arts and elevated inscriptions will be hidden. The remainder, those that may be seen with the eye, will be attributed to lowly causes, Nature, and chance, and will fall utterly from value. While each is a brilliant diamond, each becomes a piece of dull glass. His importance looks only to his animal, physical being. And as we said, the aim and fruit of his physical being is only to pass a brief and partial life as the most impotent, needy, and grieving of animals. Then it decays and departs. See how unbelief destroys human nature, and transforms it from diamonds into coal.         SECOND POINT    http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&...|`|6WsTRKENaa	Like in every nation, there are very friendly people, and not so friendly people in Turkey.

Last year, the stimulus was sent out about a month after a refund came in. You should look into the new economic policies of the new administration. Changes, if any, for this tax season should be outlined there.
QWCBoTtraa	Bern?
CyP7VMHHaa	No, they will not send you a ticket. An e-ticket is an electronic ticket. It exists only in the airline's computer system. Contrary to what some other answers say, you cannot print an e-ticket. You can print your own boarding passes, but those are not the same as a ticket.    The website where you purchased the ticket will e-mail you a confirmation. It will contain your flight schedule and a confirmation number. That's all that you need. You can check in at the airport or check yourself in online and print your own boarding passes within 24 hours of departure.    If you forget or lose your confirmation number, you can still check in at the airport using your flight number.|`|e77c54a2105590029b5c1b09151eef4aaa	No, But just print out your e-ticket and PNR/Confirmation code|`|VlhmbHGGaa	Print out the confirmation, which includes the booking reference code.

Now if I was married and with kids then it has to be Oahu.  I like to gamble with the best of them but with the kids and wife in tow, it is just plain better to go to Oahu.

PA0bGBtCaa	You will have to check those travel sites such as expedia, ortitz, and fare compare to get a good estimation. I have no idea when you are leaving, what airline you are looking to fly and what city you are departing from.    All of those factors play a huge role in determining how much you can expect to pay for a ticket. For instance, if you're flying from Paducah, KY, then you'd pay a hell of a lot more than if you flew from Louisville as one is much larger than the other.    The smaller cities are only served by regional carriers and the ticket prices are way more expensive. I would venture a guess that you can look to pay about $500 minimum for that round-trip, maybe more. If you find something lower, then I'd consider myself lucky!|`|rSwce38saa	http://www.orbitz.com    http://www.expedia.com    ;)|`|64IEjXOBaa	About $250 roundtrip|`|fZSJfirlaa	it will be around $270 dollars and all   :]    good luck

4OKE5zAlaa	I haven't been to enough places to tell you which is the most beautiful. I've been to California, though, and it's absolutely stunning. The sky is just amazing and when you're on a hill or something, it's amazing to look at the view and see the sky stretching on endlessly and the city, hills and mountains, for miles and miles. It's so beautiful, I get lost thinking about it. I've been there twice, both times were the LA/Hollywood area, and I went to Venice Beach, Malibu, and places near there as well. If you haven't been there, you need to. Of course, there's a lot of beautiful places outside the 50 US states.    I went on a cruise once. It stopped in Puerto Rico, St. Thomas Virgins Islands, Dominica, Barbados, and Aruba. Aruba was very wonderful but didn't look quite as foreign as the other places. St. Thomas Virgin Islands was VERY beautiful. Beautiful tropical forests and hills/mountains, surrounded by tons of ocean. Actually, all of those Caribbean places are really beautiful.    Cities in South America are probably beatiful, mainly places in Argentina for sure. But I've never been there.    Try any big city in India.|`|fb7u8ctSaa	As cliche as this sounds, I cannot choose just one, so I'm going to give you MY top three from my extensive world traveling:    1.  Prague:  This city is both STUNNING as well as semi-Cheap (when compared to places such as Paris or London).  The Charles Bridge is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen, and the view is absolutely gorgeous at any time of the day.  However, I did go during the Bush administration, and I would caution you to perhaps attempt to pass yourself off as some other nationality other than American.  I was German, and that worked for me.    2.  Venice:  As cliche and touristy as this city is, it's absolutely amazing and fun to just wander around in.  I would LOVE to get married here, and I've pretty much decided to go visit again REAL soon.  The Italians are awesome and renowned for their cordiality.  However, theft is a problem in this sinking city, so make sure to spread your money throughout your person and don't keep everything in one place.    3.  Paris:  Definitely a favorite of mine.  The city is wonderful both during the day and a night.  Their public transportation system is phenomenal and I would love to just be able to walk around all day.  The French, contrary to popular belief, are VERY nice as long as you attempt to ask them in French foirt and don't just assume that they should speak something other than French since that's not something you may speak.  Once you put a little effort to talk to them, they're some of the most helpful and nice people I've ever met.|`|HVQQujUvaa	Paris|`|q7frgtB6aa	new york|`|q1nwoSh1aa	Boston. :)  Ive been to Paris and its nasty & dirty & the people there are SO mean.  nyc is pretty, but in a city way|`|EJpiaCMQaa	There are many beautiful cities in the world, but none can compare to spectacular San Francisco.

JEb2Kqd4aa	Willie Revillame.|`|Imqb5ueqaa	If and only if there has to be a king, I wish our king will be Bayani Fernando.    1. He will be called King Bayani (so revered, a king and hero at the same time, how can he miss?)  2. He already performs decisively, and this attitude has rubbed off on his men (Esquivel was targeted for assassination because he implements the law to the letter)  3. He has his face all over the metropolis and even in the provinces (kings must be known to their subjects)  4. He is, I think, benevolent. His constituents in Marikina say that, and are proud of him. Benevolent kings are good kings.    In sum, he is both loved and feared. That is how kings must be seen.|`|7ONAv4vYaa	Search for all the tribes and the heir to be Datu in all parts of the country.    This can be done by DNA mapping all the people.     Then the tribes will then compete or battle each other. The Datu of the winning tribe becomes the overall king.    And his territory becomes the capital of the country, the united tribes of the pacific islands.|`|I07MtJzAaa	I would like Noli de Castro to be|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	King Noli de Castro... sounds royalty...|`|kFq62tBpaa	Imperialism !!!!!!!!!!!!

nEgJAtK7aa	I can tell you I do not like boats either. My dad drowned when I was your age. He was flipped from a fishing boat when his seat broke. I am 46 now and have been on 18 cruises. I still have problems with some boats. I will only get on those I feel safe on. On the cruise you are on a huge ship not a boat. You do not have anything to worry about you will have so much fun and will not even realize you are on a ship. There are a lot of teen activities that you will be involved with that.  Imagine the length of 3 football fields long and 8 lanes on a highway wide that is the size of some of these ships. They have shopping malls, teen dance clubs, karayoke, some even have a seperate pool and hang out area for teens.  You will have a great time. The captain of the ship will not do anything to jepordize the safety of the passangers on his ship. That is his  1 concern. I hope this helps and I hope you realize this is different than a boat and have a great vacation with your mom|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Hmm, this is a good question. I want to say that once you get on the boat, after a short while you will relax and have a great time.     However if you really have a phobia, this could be a bad idea.    Cruise ships almost never sink. Every time it happens it's all over the news, and how many times have you heard of it happening? If you're 13, I'd be surprised if you heard of more than one during your lifetime. Out of all of those cruise ships that are everywhere in the world! And even if there is some horrible problem like that, everyone can get out. There are safety boats, and at the first sign of trouble, other ships start coming to help out.    The point is, you really don't have to worry about it sinking. We've come a very long way since the Titanic ;)    But if you have a serious phobia, you'll want to see a therapist before you actually book a vacation.|`|vn6A6xK1aa	well does she know about your fear? if she does then she should understand and go with someone else, or you can practice on a small boat and slowly get rid of your fear by the time of the cruise, but i wouldnt push it.
JPssvCAvaa	They always gave out boiled sweets to suck during take off. It must be cut backs that this small thing has been stopped. Landing can be as bad. <br>  <br>  The sucking motion is best. Yawning also helps.<br>  <br>  Chewing gum wont help. Sneezing or gently pinching the nose then blowing. Like blowing your nose in a handkerchief.<br>  <br>  The ears nose and throat are all connected which is why sucking and blowing can give relief.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your flight and your stay in Tampa.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	blow your nose or yawn (those are some suggestons i have heard|`|wObFm9B4aa	LOLLY pop it is the swallow  that prevent you ears from hurting so slow sips of water but be careful if it is a 20 hour flight you don't want to be up to the bathroom two hundred times|`|Jq2K3N1Zaa	Try holding your nose closed with you fingers and blowing out.|`|kvCdRzzBaa	chew gum, i always get tons of it before i go, best way to open up your ears so there is less pressure! gooodluckkk

For example I have a problem with long walks where my ankles were killing me.  I got a shoe with an extra-wide heel for stability.  Problem solved.    You'll pay for it, but it might be worth it.

AA11450877	SYNTAX ERROR    please rephrase your question and please ask it in proper English so that normal people can understand|`|MATiTs5Oaa	Here is a link about Geography of Turkey  including Izmir  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_o...|`|7253f413ed077e409c57db486eba9fa1aa	maybe you can get some information from here : http://www.koeri.boun.edu.tr/eng/topeng....|`|q7z7Ni3Daa	If I'm understanding your question correctly, Izmir lies along the western portion of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ).     The Anatolian Plate, which consists primarily of Turkey, is being pushed west about 2-2.5 cm (0.8-1.0 in) a year, as it is squeezed between the Eurasian Plate on the north, and both the African Plate and the Arabian Plate on the south.     Major earthquakes in Turkey result from slips along the NAFZ or the Eastern Anatolian Fault.     Hope this is what you mean =).
CEy7S2Nlaa	yes, everyday i ride them...the LRT lane 1 is crowded and hot but LRT lane 2 is more comfortable and not that hot...|`|Imqb5ueqaa	Yes, a few weeks after the inaugural run.

Though I prefer MRT.|`|eDjiOWKtaa	it's convenient because i'd rather stand feeling like sardines but get to any strategic point in Manila quicker than sit in a jeepney where traffic is a factor.    there's nothing to it, just know what station to alight and make sure you're going the right way (northbound or southbound).|`|AA11441260	you should have ridden those early runs. It was total stupidity to have large glass windows that can not be opened because there were no airconditioning units yet. Yet people still rode it because it was fast|`|i1bj5UDBaa	Yes, had been riding it on the last 6 years when I was working in Manila. Getting to and from work in 20 minutes outweighs the disadvantage of riding it like sometimes the AC doesn't work or getting stuck for few minutes and being shoved when it's high peak time. It will take me 45 minutes if I take a commuter jeep or FX on the same distance and even before I reach work I would smell like I need another shower and there's also the chance that the I might get held up or my purse snatched.|`|z5fFoTMBaa	Yes, I have. Why do you ask?|`|AA11828341	Yup. Luckily, I haven't encountered any problem.    In case you need a map: http://www.lrta.gov.ph/system_map.htm|`|50pKPrHxaa	depends on what lrt you are riding. i prefer lrt 2. lrt1 is kinda not that good. i like riding lrt2 the best.i think its more spacious and nicer interior.|`|c158ee5146582ecc037e3dc9d2709399aa	Yes! I tried and used it. Its more expensive as the bus or the jeepney, but at least faster!It is not as comfortable and reliable as the metro in Paris or the equivalent in London or Tokyo  and the Stations are not customer friendly. Its the minimum possible!|`|zZZ6I3nkaa	Yes I did.     It is the first time I experience a train system that does not allow eating and taking pictures and videos.    It is the first time I experience a train system that has a section for girls only. It was unfair because in the boys section girls can stay. In North America its not like that and it was not a good experience. I would be nice if theres equality.     And lastly it was the first time I experience what sardine fishes feels when theyre in a can because we are like sardines in the train.    Anyway I'd rather take a taxi when traveling to Metro Manila. LRT is convinient and fast but expect crowds.|`|EHw8zCgJaa	It is crowded and hot but IMO, it's better off than the MTR in hong kong, or the Cityrail in oz, -it's as if you've  gone inside a train-sized armpit on one of those cars

s2IOyj8iaa	At the moment and only on certain days then Emirates have had some flights from Brisbane to Auckland and I think from Sydney also for $125 all up Fares to Nz are something to keep watching for as they have been the cheapest for many years but one needs to book when they find them Check out Jetstar as well some of the fares are expensive. You will have to live cheap on your $7000 but can be done if you shop in the supermarkets for your food and keep looking for the bargains in fares. Most fares to NZ would be 2 or 300 one way but from Cairns dearer as you would need a flight to Brisbane as well|`|NyJeK6NSaa	$70000.00 Is enough for the single person. But that totally depends on the services you take. I advice you to spent the money carefully so that you can have better tour. Travel within a zone at ￡30 , or between zones at ￡80 plus taxes.

aiKLvwGTaa	When I drive from Brum to Manchester (about 85 miles, door to door) it costs me about ￡14 return, so I'd say about ￡11.<br>  <br>  I have a 1.4 Clio, which has done 150,000 miles and is 12 years old!|`|8YfnjvExaa	Err,<br>  If you normally pay ￡20 for an hour you must drive incredibly fast or your petrol tank is leaking :-)<br>  <br>  According to the AA website the distance is 95.1 miles, OK so I take it the exact distance is 117 miles from where you are to where you want to be. Lets assume you use the accelerator quite vigorously, you should still get about 35 mpg from a 1.3 litre engine, so 117 miles will use 3.3 gallons which will cost about ￡13.50. <br>  <br>  ￡30 should do for the round trip.
4blm4djUaa	Firstly, I'd check on the maximum visa stay length allowed by Laos.  It might be as short as a maximum stay of 7 days.  That wouldn't be a problem though since areas frequented by tourists tend to be on the river which borders Thailand.  So you can just check in and back out to continue your stay.    On mid priced to budget hotels, the average cost will be 50% of the same quality in Thailand. Budget locations in Laos can be 300 to 500 bht ($11 per night) and pretty clean.    Food on street is much cheaper but more limited.    I hope this helps and you can find me here: http://kohsamuiholiday.com if you have some more questions.
MBiAm9zaaa	it really depends where you are filming. first off, what state you are filming in, and second off, are you filming on private property that doesnt belong to you or on public or your own property? if you feel like youre doing something you shouldnt be doing, you probably are.|`|fj78wRV5aa	No, I don't think so, but I could be wrong, ask your local law proffesional. Other things you will need, however, is a good crew, and decent lighting, as well as a polished script. You may also need to have people sign a release to be in your film.     Generally, schools look down upon selling things amidst the sanctity of knowledge.    But whatever.    Here's a decent way of publishing your film: Lulu.com|`|1hciyvKdaa	If you are walking around with a camera no. If you have people with lighting and grip stands, directors chairs, things that involve public safety and the likes, yes you would. So no you will not need to.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Highland Park is adjacent to Eagle Rock, but the area has a moderate to very high crime rate. Overall, NOT a safe area. There are some nice areas of HP close to Eagle Rock, but there's a reason those rents are so low: Most of it is high-crime. The main gang there is know as "Los Avenues". Coincidentally, many east-west streets are named Avenue 52, Avenue 53, etc.|`|lzEuuseJaa	Some of Highland Park is not safe, but some is nice and safe. Look bordering Pasadena, Avenue 64, near the Church of the Angels to the east around San Pasqual, which runs into South Pasadena. There aren't a lot of apt buildings, some are tucked into neighborhoods with mostly houses. Sometimes there are good deals on little house rentals in these areas.     Eagle Rock can be sketchy too, it will be obvious to you when you drive around the neighborhoods which ones are safest. Generally up above Colorado Bl or some of the hilly areas are safest. Glendale is generally safe, can be quite crowded, and varies greatly neighborhood to neighborhood. But, hey, the Galleria and Americana are right there. = )    You might look into South Pasadena. While it can be expensive, there are also smaller older buildings that aren't too bad. Most probably won't advertise, except for a sign on the property. It's very safe, people actually walk around town at night. South Pas is only 4 square miles, so you can drive around looking for signs. There are a lot of apts near Fair Oaks & State St / Raymond Hill area (near the OSH), over near Garfield Park, and near Huntington Dr.    Good luck!|`|jR8mclWIaa	No|`|cxNLOPHNaa	Highland Park is a very old (mostly depressed/run down) section of LA, just south of Eagle Rock, and Pasadena. It's mostly Latino in it's ethnicity. But you will find White and Asian residents there too (mostly towards Pasadena). The area is also seeing a lot of young urban types coming in. They seem to be buying up and restoring all the Craftsman bungalows in the area. The area is relatively safeish during the day. But at night, stay indoors. Like all of LA, some parts are better/safer than others. Personally... I think you'd be better off looking in Glendale, Pasadena or Eagle Rock. Even Alhambra if it's not too far South for you.    Basically if you can avoid it... Stay clear of Highland Park, Mount Washington, El Sereno, Garvanza, and Cypress Park if you see them in your search.
lo3T01BOaa	Most parts of Myrtle Beach are nice. The main tourist area on Ocean Blvd, the original older part, is a little seedy, but it's not too bad. In my opinion, anything between of 38th Ave at Route 17 / Kings Highway (near The Village Square shopping area) and the Highway 17 bypass / Main 17 merge (near the Dixie Stampede show) is nice. A nice place to stay is at the Marriott Grande Dunes hotel. It's located in an upscale area. It isn't like anything you would find in Florida or California, but still nice.|`|Y7koJRd5aa	There are plenty of upscale accommodations, attractions, dining and shopping. For shopping and dining try the Market Common, an new urban village. For upscale accommodations on the oceanfront Island Vista is a great choice. Marriott at Grand Dunes is another oceanfront option. These two are located on the northern side of town and are situated between large oceanfront homes. Much less crowded and about 40-60 blocks north of the downtown strip.    You can also go on the Intracoastal waterway and here you can find some nice places like Marina Inn at Grande Dunes.
NCMZy6Uqaa	Maybe you can find some store that has these kind of items in San Francisco's Japantown mall:    Some stores have website:  http://www.sfjapantown.org/shop.html    Good luck :)    EDIT: the pictures look like a craft that is called "chirimen", which is made from fabric.

cK28Kl0Uaa	CSULA is NOT in a nice area.  It's in the heart of east LA.  Almost all the students commute to school.  There is no "campus life".    CSULB is in Long Beach which is a much better area.  It is a very large school (50,000 students?).  Not that many live on campus but a lot live in apartments near the campus.  Long Beach is a beach community so it is not a "hip" as the UCLA but there are many areas for students to go out.
eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	When you try to enter the clubs after 11pm, if you look too young, the door person asks for your sea card. When the sea card is scanned it shows if you are underage or not. There is no way to fake the sea card or even use someone else's sea card as it also shows a photograph of the owner.  If you look old enough, normally the door person just lets you through without asking for your sea card.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	I would think not, as you are required to have either a birth certificate with seal or passport when you board ship.  There they give you a card that you use for all purchases.  fake driver's license etc wouldn't make any difference at any bars or night clubs.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Hmmm. You are on a cruise ship. Have ever heard about passports? Do you really think that you can get on one without the staff knowing exactly how old you are? You have to provide your cabin details to be served.|`|S0uCKptBaa	No a fake ID won't work to get in the clubs. On the ship they issue you a sea pass card which acts as your ID, credit card and room key. The cards have different markings on them to distinguish your age. So if you are underage they can immediately tell when looking at your card.|`|X6rFPI2laa	The only ID that works for anything on a ship is the ID the ship makes for you the day your board the ship.  If a club has an age limitation and if they are checking IDs at the door you can probably forget it!  However, some ships don't enforce the age limits for entry into clubs, particularly if they aren't very crowded, so you might get in just fine.  Everybody will check a ship ID before selling alcohol, though.|`|gXJdryRNaa	It may get you into clubs but it won't get you served drinks.  Your cruise card is what they look at and it has all your personal information on it, including your age.  You can show them your fake id but they will still want to see your cruise card and they will scan it.  Standard procedure.|`|vA1zMzhKaa	You might be able to get into the club, but you won't be able to buy drinks. When you board you will be given a cruise card, it acts like a credit card for everything you buy onboard, but is also your cabin key and your ID when entering or leaving the ship in ports. As soon as the bartender swipes your card, the system will tell him/her that you are under 18.    By all means, go, you'll still have plenty of fun. But if you want to drink with your friend, I suggest you wait until you're 18 (if you're cruising the South Pacific, everywhere else the drinking age is 21).|`|dCw0maZnaa	no. most cruises now have a card you must use to get into clubs like that, and theres no way you're gonna get a fake one of those to work.|`|AA10863339	No Way! the people that check you into to the cruise and customs which you will have to get through even before you are allowed to board the cruise are trained to look out for fake id's including travel documents and passports.don't try it because you can get arrested if you get caught!~|`|7d8e86a9aedfe299e8309f1c873cc2d5aa	Nope, not a chance.
ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Dance: For LA, you can always go with the old standby "I Love LA", by Randy Newman. Or how about "La La Land" by Demi Lovato?     Male Cheerleading? That's a little more "West Hollywood"    Style? Casual. Cargo Shorts, flip flops, and a polo shirt. Hey, it's 80 degrees today.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Here are some themes synonymous with LA:    "I Love LA" by Randy Newman is a great song to use, so is "California Dreamin' by the Beach boys and Dr. Dre's California Love.    Surfer dudes - they definitely still exist out here, Baywatch, classic Hollywood stars (Marilyn Monroe, etc.), crowded freeways (the freeways are so crowded it's practically a joke now out here), movies, LA Lakers, LA Clippers, the fact that we have two of every team except NO pro football teams, palm trees, valley girls, etc.    Some of those could be used for decorations and dressing up (surfers, hollywood, homeless people, lifeguards, LA Lakers)|`|Ww0xfq5Aaa	depends on what the competitions are like if you have to decorate a float, i would say focus on hollywood blvd and do grauman's & kodak and the H&H shopping center, and across the street is El Cap. and Jimmy Kimmel Live Taping plus the TV Guide Studio Also you can have the hottest guys in your grade walk around shirtless in denim jeans and rainbow sandals...like 'crombie models...|`|DhFEDEwIaa	1 word: HOLLYWOOD!  why not have everybody dress as a celebrity or something to do with old Hollywood?  film directors? Beverly hills  CA is known for its beaches, and surfing  Disneyland (:
Uv3TFsqOaa	Woodgate (Queensland) a small caravan park on the coast you turn off at Childers and have a 45 minute drive. This quite spot is only across the road from the beach and is a pet friendly caravan park. The sites are always well maintained and the grounds are very clean and tidy, all amenities such as showers and toilets always spotlessly clean and neat. The other advantage of this park and town of Woodgate is the abundance of local wildlife from birds to Kangaroos who all move around town with complete freedom Woodgate is not a town which has been commercialised  few shops (just the necessary) plus a small pub with a great front lawn with tables and chairs which you and you dog (in our case a Cocker Spaniel) can sit and enjoy a cold beer or wind and watch the water or the world go by.|`|L7eFJpBtaa	Come on Sunrise wake up - there are some fantastic parks around Australia, but the best? - Ashmore palms without doubt.  We have 3 girls they love the pool and the laid-on activities, all in a safe friendly family environment.  And all in the middle of everythng else the Goldcoast has to offer. We just love it...The only downer, it is so good you have to be really organised and book well in advance to be able to secure the accommodation you want.  But it is worth the effort.  If there is a better place in Australia for families to stay - I'd love to see it on Sunrise.|`|lpXuohzwaa	There is no competition here... The best caravan park by far is Darlington Beach Holiday Park on the Coffs Coast. The staff are super friendly, the location is amazing and the facilities and activities on offer keep our whole family happy and entertained the entire time we are there, half the time we don't even leave the park.  To top it off the local wildlife is the friendliest I have encountered, not many places you can go and feed the wild birds and ducks out of your hand. Even the Kangaroos let you get pretty close to them.  We met lots of friends on our first holiday there a couple of years ago and we all return every year, meeting more new friends each time.  Can't wait to go back this year, the kids are already counting down the weeks.  Highly recommend it as holiday destination!|`|wzTnhDgCaa	We flew to Darwin and on a recommendation from friends booked in at Hidden Valley Tourist Park at Berrimah.  We spoilt ourselves and travelled to Darwin on the Ghan.  The staff were extremely helpful in offering advice on transport options to the park.  We were picked up by a personal driver who drove me to the park where the staff had arranged for the lights to be left on together with the air conditioner.  Our Rainforest Retreat was exceptional - very clean and comfortable set in a beautiful rainforest active with lizards, frogs, birds and all that makes up the Top End.  Each morning we were greeted by the cheerful reception staff as we purchased the local paper & milk.  We spent a very enjoyable evening with Gina at Bush Poetry sessions which were a great event. Would definitely recommend Hidden Valley as the best caravan park in Australia  - no bad bathrooms or uncomfortable beds there!|`|NRSos0hVaa	Darlington Beach Holiday Park - just north of Coffs Harbour.    This park is incredible. The staff are outstanding, I have never been anywhere where you receive the service you get there. From the moment you arrive at reception you feel like you are entering another world.     The children are entertained for your entire stay. The villas are amazing, or if you are camping the sites are the biggest I have seen anywhere I have travelled. You are right on the most beautiful beach.     Don't miss this out on the best park in Australia. You will regret it if you don't go.     This park was voted the best of the best last year in the CCIA awards, your only have to go once to see why.|`|ph8DN0Ffaa	Ocean Beach Holiday Park - Umina Beach, NSW    This park is awesome! A great holiday for the whole family! Cabins, villas and plenty of camping/caravan sites. Located on the beach just over an hour from Sydney, a great spot to getaway for the weekend. Plenty of activities for the children and excellent facilities and services. This is by far the best park that caters for caravans that I have been to.|`|rvYmTRkAaa	Come on people, sure these parks are nice if you like the hustle and bustle of the coast, but if you want a true aussie caravan park experience, head inland.  There are so many to pick from, it is hard to single out any specific "best" one.  Thargomindah, south west queensland would certainly make the finals though, with facilities and ground design second to none.  Such a little pearler in a small country town.  You've got to experience it.  Richmond, western queensland, again a pearler of a spot, complete with awesome views, and a top little butcher shop in town as well.  These and many more reasons put it onto the must do list.             So many out there, hook up the caravan or pack the tent and get out there and live the "real" life, you won't regret it|`|BdA7wDT1aa	I totally agree with Ashmore Palms Holiday Village, however their sister village, Brisbane Holiday Village is Queensland's best kept secret.  Boasting an eco-friendly environment with luxury 4.5 star cabins, first class facilities including a cafe, putt-putt course, exciting playground, tennis courts and two impressive  swimming pools. It the most family fun you will find only 12 mins from Brisbane CBD. Whether you are camping, caravaning or just wanting a relaxing holiday, Brisbane Holiday Village will exceed your expectations.|`|U9yBCtfKaa	The reason why Ashmore didnt get a mention i would imagine is   look at the titile,   Australias best CARAVAN PARKS   ashmore is not a caravan park,  it is only cabins, and chalets, and some on site vans,  yes we have stayed there and have no complaints, but  they were looking at CARAVAN PARKS meaning you take your own caravan,      half the sited they mentioned I would not vote as the best at all, I have been to sharks bay  and coral bay , nothing flash about them at all,    I think he was more going on the location of the parks not what they offered holiday makers, as both the above, dont have pools etc, are right beside the ocean    I love Mandalay here in wa, at busselton 1 st class, i must say, no doubt there is more, we have not been to|`|8f1pxRwFaa	I believe the best caravan park in Australia is Ashmore Palms in Ashmore, QLD.      My family and I have been there twice in 4 years and we absolutely loved it!!!  The family atmosphere it provides was exactly what our family was after and the kids loved the adventure playground and the fabulous swimming pool it has.      There was no time to sleep in because of the numerous children's activities that were on in the morning and throughout the day.  They also have beautiful paths / walkways with interesting sights to look at ie. beautiful macaws that the children were taken with.  We were always booking a game of tennis, as this was our way of finishing up for the day and we loved it for the fact that my mum (grandma) always wanted to be the umpire and she enjoyed making us laugh trying to get up on the umpire's chair. That vision will always remain with us.    We always felt safe and secure at Ashmore Palms and the facilities such as laundry, BBQ areas  were always kept clean and tidy.  I never had more fun cooking and cleaning!  We'll always have very fond memories of our holidays at Ashmore Palms and can't wait to save up so we can go back there before too long.|`|o3vFcIgmaa	Ashmore Palms on the Gold Coast would be my top pick for the best caravan park.  We stayed last year in February and it was the most gorgeous tropical paradise.  We live in country Victoria, so we were so grateful to see lush green gardens.  We are used to seeing dead lawns and wilting trees every day, so it was just beautiful.  The pool area is just lovely with waterfalls and fresh green plants.  The staff were also very lovely and helpful.  Ten out of Ten for me!!!|`|BYZw8fkOaa	My favourite caravan parks are varied in price, amenities and locations!  1. My favourite would have to be Ashmore Palms Holiday Park on the Gold Coast. It is centrally located, has fabulous amenities, the accommodation is beautiful and the staff very friendly. I wish I could visit it more often!  www.ashmorepalmsgoldcoast.com.au    2. My second favourite would be Middleton Beach Holiday Village in Albany WA. It is centrally located, has wonderful amenities, and good accommodation. We have been there several times.  www.middleton-beach-holiday-park.wa.bi...    3. My next favourite is Pemberton Caravan Park in Pemberton WA. It is a really old park, the amenity blocks really need replacing, which I have been told is on the way, but the people are incredibly friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxing and peaceful. It is in the middle of Karri forest and you are surrounded by nature. Close to a natural swimming pool and 500m to town, and only 300 km from Perth, it is a regular destination.  www.pembertonpark.com.au|`|imMFOlOlaa	The best Caravan Park in Australia by far is Ashmore Palms on the Gold Coast.  We have stayed in many caravan parks from far Nth Queensland to NSW and I can tell you Ashmore Palms wins hands down.  They have a wide variety of accomodation types to suit all needs and budgets.  The accomodation is clean, lovely furnished and has everything you would need on a holiday, like a home away from home.  They cater for children with activities each day and I know my children loved the birds and the pool.  Our family would not hesitate to recommend this caravan park to anyone.    Karen Tindall|`|aq6PMfSsaa	Our family of five stayed at Ashmore Palms Holiday Village on the Gold Coast in one of their wonderful fully equipped cabins. Not only did we have a great pool, playgrounds, BBQ facilities and amenities we were very close to all the major attractions of theme parks and shopping. The whole family had a great time and can not wait to head back there. We can not believe you missed this sensational place Greg!!!|`|HH5dmGAcaa	As a Victorian family with children that are getting onto teenage years, we have found Ashmore Palms on the Gold coast provides a great location to access all the beaches, theme parks and the other Gold Coast attractions. We have found the beautifully cared grounds at Ashmore Palms are kept to the same five star standard as the new RACV caravan park and resort at Inverloch in Victoria where we have recently stayed. Before RACV Inverloch opened we had some wonderful holidays at the RACV caravan park and resort in Cobram on the NSW border, RACV Cobram is more suited to families with younger children. As our family gets older, we appreciate the extra trimmings that are provided for us in a resort like Ashmore Palms, it is fantastic resort for both younger and older families.|`|u9knn1skaa	Hi    To me and no doubt as i used another caravan Parks before, Ashmore Palms at Ashmore in Queensland is the best caravan Park in the whole world.We,me and my family went there first time a few years ago and since then it is a must for us to go on our holiday and we been staying there anytime we go to QLD for holidays.My older daughter just did get married and she choose to stay there as well as she knows the park very well and she just loves it!!!You can stay and choose depending on your family budget form a caravan to a luxurious challet.Simly the best!!!|`|QCydp8rmaa	In my opinion Ashmore palms holiday village was fantastic , the accommodation was fabulous the whole park was spotless . It was the best place for our three children , it has playgrounds, pools, tennis courts, a walking track that goes around the whole park,and daily activities for the kids. Best of all it was only 10- 15 mins away from all the theme parks and 5-10 mins to the main street of the gold coast, so you were not amongst the hustle & bustle of the gold coast, which is great with small children . We will return and stay there each time we stay on the gold coast.|`|0wqa0ciVaa	Treasure Island Holiday Park on the Gold Coast wins hands down!  Its an amazing place.. There is so much available - 3 swimming pools, putt putt golf, tennis, go karts, a jumping pillow and much more - the kids have so much fun and its great to be able to spend so much time with them at all the facilities and activities as well.  Its also central to all the major theme parks, close to Harbourtown Shopping Centre (only 200m away) and there is a bistro and bar onsite.. So there is nothing better than at the end of the long day - walking into the bar, sitting out on the deck and enjoying an ice cold beer or wine!! Its the perfect place for families!  If you havent been there - you need to!|`|5wq9AC4jaa	My favorite Caravan Park in Australia would have to be Hidden Valley Tourist Park in Darwin.  The staff are very friendly and helpful and will go out of their way to give the extra mile.  The young managers take an active roll in the running of the park and provide guests with that personal touch.  Noel's Happy Hours and Gina's Bush Poetry are to be seen to be believed!!  The grounds and facilities are superb offering all the lush tropical plants & gardens. The standard of the accommodation would rival the top hotels, but don't have the same price tag. I have visited this park on many occasions and we have always had a wonderful experience.  It's all about atmosphere at this park and the Managers & staff certainly know their stuff!|`|wDAYYHDCaa	We went to Darwin as a special destination point in June, 2008 and stayed at Hidden Valley Tourist Park for what turned out to be a great time.  The park was the greenest in Darwin, a central location with easy access to the city.  The only park not located on a main road.  Not a huge park but quiet and personal with the nicest swimming pool.  The happy hour and bush poetry sessions were really enjoyable. The staff were very friendly especially an extra jolly housekeeper - Dipsie Densie!  The degree of personal relationships set up here was great as the staff took special interest on getting to know you, your interests and what you want to do during your stay.  The tour information desk was informative and extremely helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at Hidden Valley - our pick for best caravan park in Australia for sure!|`|2JOlwsl7aa	I too have traveled this wide brown land for many years and one cannot beat the wonderful Hidden Valley Park in Darwin.  If you are heading up to the Top End, this park is definitely the place to stay.  The staff make you feel like one of the family and Noel is just a scream!!  Watch out for his beautiful blue eyes though, they make you melt.  Noel's wife is a bit of a character too with her performances of Bush Poetry a real treat.  Her rendition of "Turbulence" is the best I have seen, complete with spectacular bull bucking and Akubra hat!  "Buck you Bastard Buck!!" This park is by far the best!!  There is just no place like Darwin either.  Hope the staff at Hidden Valley read this - Keep up the good work guys.|`|qTW0HrhCaa	For all those people who say Ashmore Palms I agree it is good...but you haven't ventured to far Nth Qld and the Coconut Resort in Cairns.  I believe this place is THE BEST caravan park in Australia.  It offers the best of both worlds from pitching a tent, to pulling up in a caravan, to staying in one of their cabins.    They have the BEST range of activites within the resort from trampolines, mini golf, adventure playground, swimming pools with water slides, tennis, giant chess and the list goes on...........    It is set in lush tropical parklands and is a little piece of paradise for the perfect family holiday that need not cost a fortune!!!!!    Check it out for yourself at www.coconut.com.au|`|wPaulbSaaa	Treasure Island Holiday Park on the Gold Coast would have to be the most fantastic Holiday park in Australia - My children love it and when you have happy children you have a great holiday - From the moment you arrive the staff make you feel so welcome the cleanliness and the facilities are amazing - The location is perfect away from the hussle and bussle but yet still close to everything.  Next to Harbourtown Shopping centre and close to the theme parks is ideal for my family|`|KOz6vz7Haa	Cowes Caravan Park Phillip Island - located right on the beach, none of this path ways to the beach. This family / dog friendly park in open to the beach right in the heart of the main suburb of Phillip Island. Walking distance to main town centre, by beach or road.   Friendly staff and Managment. Ideal family retreat (even with the doggies).|`|SJTPBLcHaa	My vote is definitely Brisbane Holiday village in Queensland. My family and I stay there every year. We have traveled all over Australia and it is by far the BEST! The facilities are to 5 star standard- pool, cafe, tennis court, putt putt, and the rooms are immaculate and perfect for families! They also have tent sites, caravan sites, we choose the cabins cause my partner and I like to travel in style. The staff are so friendly. Every year when we arrive the Manager always comes to greet us, and he even kicks the footy with my son and takes him for a ride on the golf buggy. My son always asks how many more sleeps until we go to Brisbane Holiday Village, and when we leave all I hear is I want to go back to play footy with Geoff (he is the Manager). By memory I think they have even won a few Australian tourism awards. Honestly if your reading this and you are looking for a great place to stay Brisbane Holiday Village is the place for you. www.brisbaneholiday.com.au.  5 star vote for me!|`|a17KCIiLaa	Hi Guys...  Have to agree that the 1770 camping ground is one great spot. After stopping there some 6 years ago for a night, we spent the following 7 there...Had to return a couple of weeks later, (we lived in Brisbane).  Eventually we had to have some for ourselves, so we purchased the most magnificent ocean view land, talk about sea change for the better  The travel shows come here a couple of times a year, they don't need too, as they have been before, but they love coming back, again and again, your turn next Fifi..  P.S. 1770 is so named as it was the landing spot of James Cook., 24 May 1770 This was his first landing in what was to become Queensland.

Go on come and have a look, it wont kill ya...!!|`|fCIL6Rkzaa	Discovery Holiday Park in Eden is the most beautiful I have been to, having driven all round the county staying in cabins in parks.  Waterfront, green, leafy, magic.  I drive the long way from Sydney to Melbourne to stop off for a night there.  Gets my vote!|`|lQ16mxrjaa	Ashmore Village in Nerang and its sister park; Brisbane Holiday Village  Both parks are centeral to theme parks, Gold Coast and Brisbane.  They have excellent facilities, resort style pools, clean environments and range of accomodation options.|`|DA7GvaX9aa	Ashmore Palms on the Sunshine Coast.

Not only is the location of this caravan park fantastic, (close to all theme parks, walk to local shopping centre and public transport at the door step). The staff at this wonderful resort are so helpful, its like having a tourist info on site. I have stayed at Ashmore Palms once, and I stayed in the budget 2 bedroom villa unit and then in the Macaw Mansion, they both were fully equipped with everything that I needed to enjoy our family holiday. I have receommened Ashmore Palms to so many families and they have all come back from holidays raving about how fantastic this place is to stay, but not only that, it is also suited for the budget conscious traveller. This destination has also got a great swimming area with several pools to accommodate everyone and also plenty of playgrounds, walks and bbq's.

I have stayed there twice now and if money allowed would stay many more times.|`|sif9IUCzaa	ASHMORE PALMS HOLIDAY VILLAGE Gold Coast.  You have the best park with so many visitors coming from Australia wide.  The mushroom pool and the waterfall pool are enticing, the accommodation A++, the shop and internet room - a great way to keep in touch or buy products.  I have stayed at Ashmore Palms with my family for 3 weeks and met a lovely family from Albury where we still stay in contact after 5 years.  We enjoyed lazing around the pool and going by bus to the markets and shopping in Surfers. Their website is www.ashmorepalmsgoldcoast.com.au.  What a great website for anyone looking to stay at gold coast. Take a look for yourself.|`|HMvM54Nwaa	We are not regulars at caravan parks, but when my husband had to work on the Gold Coast for a week, we decided to stay at Ashmore Palms so my 4 year old would have a playground and pool to entertain her. We stayed in a Lorikeet Lodge which was very nice, clean and had a well equipped kitchen etc. The playground - actually there were two - was great fun for my daughter. There was also daily activities in the mornings for the kids, and a shuttle bus service to local attractions. The pool was lovely and my daughter loved the colourful concrete mushrooms and croc in the pool.  I think what I liked the most was the walk way around the perimeter of the resort, and the many birds they had - including the magnificent macaws.  Our stay was wonderful  - it was like a 5 star resort but designed for families. It certainly opened our eyes to how caravan parks could be. My daughter is still talking about it. And next time we plan a holiday up to the Gold Coast we won't have to look around for accommodation. We will stay at Ashmore Palms again. I believe they own another park in Brisbane. I would probably check that one out if we are going to Brisbane as well.   So if you want a great family holiday park I definitely recommend Ashmore Palms Gold Coast.|`|0BKL63itaa	Definately Ashmore Palms Holiday Village on the Gold Coast Queensland!

VvbOSbRnaa	My roomate was from Japan. I live in Tampa... but what she did was she had a layover in Dallas. She would fly to Dallas from Tampa. Then from Dallas to Toyko. More than likely you will have to fly into a larger airport (ie: Dallas) and that would get you there. I highly doubt there is any direct flights from Memphis to Toyko.
Al4xzacyaa	Angeli what are you asking?    Well if a foreign tourist gets a job and is allowed to work legally, additionally have a nice character and appearance, I am sure they would attract.  Bar tending is a hard job and require mainly night work.  However I am not a bar type and without insulting those who frequent bars, I would suggest that your best choices will not be found in a bar because these are lonely people who do not have a happy social life and that is why they are in a bar. . .What can I tell you.  For the present your question is unclear and this is my best analogy. When I was looking for action that was the place I hung out.  Recently I hung around Manila PI bars and gawed I am ready to go back soon!  OH one more thing, wages are not very good in bars so you must really be special and put up with lots of characters to live off tips and all those who make passes at you.
oAOUXSJcaa	As some people wrongly think, Catalan is not a dialect of Spanish or a mixture of Spanish and French. Catalan comes directly from Latin and is as old as any of these languages.    As an example. Portuguese is more similar to Spanish than Catalan. Whereas Catalan has common elements with French. Compare the translation of the sentence "I want to eat eight apples".    Spanish: quiero comer ocho manzanas  Portuguese: quero comer oito ma??s    Catalan: vull menjar vuit pomes  French. je veux manger huit pommes    In any case Catalan has a twin language, which is Occitan (also called Proven?al), spoken in Southern France, on a valley in Catalonia (Aran) and some areas of the Piemont region in Italy.    Catalan is official in Catalonia, toghether with Spanish and it is also spoken in big cities, also Barcelona. Working class of urban areas is more Spanish-speaker, as most of them are immigrants or their children, who arrived in Catalonia in the 60s from other Spanish regions, whereas middle and upper classes from the cities speak more Catalan and in villages nearly everybody speaks Catalan.    All Catalan speakers can also speak fluent Spanish nowadays but not all Spanish navite speakers in Catalonia have learnt it, even if Catalan is the main language used at primary, secondary education and university.    Catalan is spoken not only on the autonomous region of Catalonia (capital Barcelona) but also:  - In Andorra, an independent state, where it is the only official   language.  - In the Balearic Islands (Mallorca and rest of islands)  - In the Valencia region, where it is also called Valencia.  - In a stripe of territory in Aragon, neighbouring region to Catalonia.  - In the French Catalonia (Rousillon), on the other side of the Pyrenees.   - In Alguer (Alghero), a town in Sardinia (Italy).    The independence of Catalonia has never been voted (as some previous post wrote). It was the modificationof our statute of autonomy|`|tQsxsuNPaa	You'll be able to understand it written without any real tutoring, and you'll be able to pick it up pretty quickly.  If you're already fluent.  Of course, everyone speaks Spanish everywhere.  Most people were raised before it was legal to teach cataln, so, you'll do just fine.  They will surely LOVE it as you pick up a little Cataln along the way.    BTW, if you feel the urge, there are some places online, where you can study Cataln for free.  Just search.|`|33b29bdd98f8d8d34167893336d47bfeaa	Just to reemphasize, Catalan is nothing like Castillian Spanish. It is a completely different Language. But "Spanish" is spoken everywhere in Spain. In the Northeast corner of Spain they speak Gallego. The Basques speak Basque.|`|8a1c4efde714f3448706c28696452e2eaa	Catalan is a Spanish Language because it is spoken in Spain. Castilian is thought of as "Spanish" throughout the world since it is the dominant language, but it is just one of many Spanish languages. You are right that Catalan is not related to Castilian. Saying Catalan is not Spanish is like saying Cantonese is not Chinese because everyone associates Mandarin with Chinese or Hindi as Indian, when there are many other languages in India.     Catalan is a Spanish language. Meaning people from Spain speak Catalan. It is thought that around 10 million people do so. However almost all Spaniards speak Castilian which is what most people think of as the Spanish language spoken in Latin America as well but in its only dialect depending ont he Country.     Catalan is mainly spoken in Catalonia which is a province including Barcelona and the surrounding evirons. You can get away with out knowing any Catalan. You really don't hear it much outside of this region. If you are looking for beach locations then Barcelona is good, you may also consider Malaga in the south, or San Sebastian in the North.     San Sebastian is in the Basque country where they speak Basque. This is a non-Latin Language that is spoken in this area of Spain and the Basque country of southern France as well. Most people in the Basque country also speak Castilian, so you can get away without knowing this as well.     In Southern Spain you will mostly only find Castilian spoken in its regional dialect.     Gallego is spoken in the north eastern part of the country above Portugal. This land is called Galicia and not surprisingly, sounds a lot like Portuguese. Again, everyone speaks Castilian as well, so you don't need to learn Gallego if you want to check out a cool beach location like A Coruna.     The region around Valencia speaks Valenciana and they also have their own language on Mallorca. So many languages for a Country slightly larger than the State of Arizona.      The state was united under Castilian which was emposed by the government at the time. This is why it is spoken everywhere in the country today as well as Spain's previous colonies.     You can read more at: http://www.spanishabroad.com/barcelona-s...    If you want to learn Spanish (Castilian) at a school in Spain, feel free to check out our programs at: http://www.spanishabroad.com|`|4oLThcKEaa	I'm sorry Matt but you are wrong.    Catalan is NOT a Spanish language, or a dialect of Spanish at all. It is it's own individual language, and to be honest is nothing like Spanish at all, if you wanted to compare it, it is more alike French and Italian than Spanish.  You will have to take lessons just like you would with any other language. To be honest with you, you can get by just fine with Spanish, and you can pick Catalan up as you go along!! There was a recent poll for the ''independance'' of Catalonia. There are close to 10 million native Catalan speakers......... only 2 million bothered to vote......... and out of those 2 million, 76% percent want Catalonia to be independant, and have Catalan as the only official language.    SO........ i wouldn't worry about it too much, Spanish is the dominant language especially in the bigger cities in Catalonia, especially Barcelona. You may need to know some simple phrases, and be able to read Catalan menu's when eating out, but i wouldnt worry about it too much :D|`|2IeIDq2raa	Cataln is a language, it is not a dialect from Spanish.   It is as old as Castellano (Spanish) and French. They all come from latin.    Basque is spoken in Basque country, it doesnt come from latin and its origin is unknown. it is even older than french, castillian or cataln.    Gallego comes from latin and it is spoken in Galicia. It is very similar to Portuguese.    Thats all, it is not so difficult.    SPANISH IS SPOKEN, WRITTEN AND UNDERSTOOD IN WHOLE SPAIN, ANYWHERE.    To Matt: Yes, we have many different languages in a region even smaller than Arizona, but Spain is a very old country with a great history... How old is Arizona??  What is the history of Arizona??

Florence - the Uffizi, Galleria d'Academia, Pallazo Pitti and the Boboli Gardens, the little town of Fiesole.    The leaning tower of Pisa, but it's a real tourist trap out there.     The mediaeval city of Siena, particularly in early summer. Try to go on a weekend.     Pompeii, near Naples. Everyone should see it once.     The city of Naples. In a country of friendly people, the Neopolitans outdid the rest of the country in friendliness, which is really saying something. It is also a gorgeous city, and I think it's a crying shame that there are problems there again.

Xoooc2K1aa	Considering that we in Hawaii can barely get to Los Angeles for less than that $400 right now, I doubt you'll find anything coming this way in the price range you're looking for.    I would suggest you look into getting a flight on something like Southwest to the West coast and then jumping on a "cheap" $400 fare from the west coast to Hawaii.    You can also try priceline, expedia, or travelocity.  Sometimes they have some really good fares on there but you should always price verify the flights you want on the actual airline website. Sometimes it's cheaper to get it direct from the airline themselves.    Good luck and happy travels!|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	If your dates are flexible, I highly recommend Travelocity.  There's a check box that says "flexible dates".  If you select it, it will show you the lowest fares available for the entire date range you're considering.  You can often save hundreds of dollars by flying on weekdays rather than weekends.    By the way, I think it's Priceline that lets you name your price.  As far as I know, Expedia doesn't offer that.|`|hkzGYQD4aa	None of these are under 650, but here are some:  http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/app...  http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/app...

KdFXk0ajaa	No, that is just silly. You feel like you are wearing a wet, woolen blanket. In cold weather states they have the wind chill factor.. here in the Sunshine State we have the heat index. So if the air temp is say 88 degrees then factor in the at least 70% humidity it feels like 100 degrees. Link below. Live like a native... do outdoor activities either early in the day say before 11 a.m. and after the sun sets.
KdFXk0ajaa	dc20k is a tad delusional about Florida. I have lived here since 1983 and hurricanes are a part of life she does not recall 2004 when we got hit by four succesive storms one even hit the state 2 or 3 times. Obviously she is not a homeowner as between ridiculously high homeowners insurance rates, equally high property taxes and low wages it is not the great escape it used to be.. unless your family has really deep pockets. Having been in all states on the East Coast and as far west as Colorado Springs, CO down southwest to Texas, New Orleans, all of New England, NY State, Ohio, thru Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas. Having family and friends in So. Cal (Burbank to be exact), Seattle, Las Vegas.. if I had to do it all over again I would live in one of these 4 states: Colorado.. Colorado Springs is absolutely gorgeous. Very Conservative place.<br>  Charleston, SC... really laid back mid size city with no state tax, low cost of living, Folly Beach, and golf courses galore... very historic place.  Upstate NY.. if you like winter sports in the Mohawk Valley there are snowmobile trails that stretch from Lake George all the way to the Canadian border. I was stationed in Rome, NY in the USAF and it is 40 miles from Syracuse which is a really rocking college town. Finally.. I never imagined myself saying this but the San Antonio, TX area. Over to Austin in the foothills or even down to Houston as you are not far from Mexico or South Padre Island for spring breaks and vacations.<br>  Lastly in my adopted home state of Florida. The best place in this state is in the horse country around Ocala. Centrally located you are equidistant to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. No more than an hour to Orlando and Gainesville .... Home of the Biggest Party college and NCAA Football and Basketball Champions in the same calendar year... University of Florida Fighting Gators.

HIMsPI8eaa	The Tower of Pisa was a work of art, performed in three stages over a period of about 177 years. Construction of the first floor of the white marble campanile began on August 9, 1173, a period of military success and prosperity. This first floor is surrounded by pillars with classical capitals, leaning against blind arches.<br>  <br>  The tower began to sink after construction progressed to the third floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-meter foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil. This means the design was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, because the Pisans were almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled. In 1198, clocks were temporarily installed on the third floor of the unfinished construction.<br>  <br>  In 1272, construction resumed under Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built higher floors with one side taller than the other. This made the tower begin to lean in the other direction. Because of this, the tower is actually curved.[3] Construction was halted again in 1284, when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.<br>  <br>  The seventh floor was completed in 1319. The bell-chamber was not finally added until 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the bell-chamber with the Romanesque style of the tower. There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.<br>  <br>  After a phase (1990-2001) of structural strengthening [4], the tower is currently undergoing gradual surface restoration, in order to repair visual damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly strong due to the tower's age and to its particular conditions with respect to wind and rain.[5]<br>  <br>  Timeline<br>  <br>      * On January 5, 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sessanta soldi or "sixty coins" to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. This money was to be used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower today.[6]<br>      * On August 9, 1173, the foundations of the Tower were laid.[7]<br>      * Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote : "Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in [this] year 1174 with Bonanno as sculptor, laid the foundations of the belltower of the cathedral in Pisa."<br>      * Another possible builder is Gerardo di Gerardo. His name appears as a witness to the above legacy of Berta di Bernardo as "Master Gerardo", and as a worker whose name was Gerardo.<br>      * A more probable builder is Diotisalvi, because of the construction period and the structure's affinities with other buildings in Pisa. But he usually signed his works, and there is no signature by him in the belltower.<br>      * Giovanni di Simone was heavily involved in the work of completing the tower, under the direction of Giovanni Pisano, who at the time was master builder of the Opera di Santa Maria Maggiore. He could be the same Giovanni Pisano who completed the belfry tower.<br>      * Giorgio Vasari indicates that Tommaso di Andrea Pisano was the designer of the belfry between 1360 and 1370.<br>      * On December 27, 1233 the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the construction of the belltower.[8]<br>      * On February 23, 1260 Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni, a worker on the cathedral Santa Maria Maggiore, was elected to oversee the building of the Tower.[9]<br>      * On April 12, 1264 the master builder Giovanni di Simone and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[10]<br>  <br>  The architect<br>  <br>  There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano [11], a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, famous for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Bonanno Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. His sarcophagus was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820. However recent studies[12] seem to indicate Diotisalvi as the original architect due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola (Pisa) and the Baptistery in Pisa. However, he usually signed his works and there is no signature by him in the bell tower which leads to further speculation.|`|6UHMxWKBaa	Didn't Chuck Norris once lean against some tower in Pisa...|`|URZNtrxsaa	You have asked one of the great mystery questions that has alluded historians and architects alike for years. While everyone knows that the tower was built as a bell tower for the cathedral and when it was built, no one has every been able to determine who was behind the design.|`|uzQFfUypaa	i'm from italy and i live in pisa is beautiful but usa is very beautiful =)|`|nbrOvWxDaa	Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano

I think there's Starnberg nearby, where you'll also have the advantage of having the Starnberg Lake (Starnberger See) nearby, a great place to go swimming, and the S-Bahn (suburb train) to Munich ends there, so you can be in Munich in less than an hour.<br>  <br>  Other villages with a good train connection to Munich are Ottobrunn/H?henkirchen or Neuperlach. They don't have the advantage of a nearby lake, but accomodation should be cheaper and should be easily found for a family of five.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  edit:<br>  I don't understand why people thumbed Manni down; he's absolutely right, except for one thing: I would rather recommend the BMW museum. All kids, young and old, love cars! I also agree with chapinero about the Filmstudios: They have a life-size model of "Das Boot" there and make guided tours. [Att., spoiler ahead: They sound the alarm sirens and shout "dive, dive!" when you're in about the middle of the tour.]<br>  <br>  But I disagree with the point that staying in the center of Munich is best. Traveling on the local trains can by itself be a wonderful experience, and upper Bavaria has beautiful landscapes you'd completely miss if you're only "in the heart of the city".|`|AA10678637	Especially with kids I would recommend NOT to stay far away , but in the center of Munich.<br>  <br>  Makes things so much easier. There are plenty of things to do here with kids:<br>  <br>  - English garden<br>  - outdoor swimming pools with fun rides<br>  - Bavaria film studios<br>  - beer gardens with playgrounds<br>  - parks<br>  - toy museum<br>  - and much more

HziXc5Ovaa	Yes, I read this article today as well. I'd learned they were our brothers at the time of the crash because a couple of different friends of mine knew them here in Canada.<br>  <br>  Especially being a whole family...how sad. But they were faithful and are in the best place being in Jehovah's loving memory. They will be back and will be warmly welcomed back. May Jehovah continue to strengthen their families, as well as keep all of us as brothers and sisters encouraged.<br>  Agape.|`|k03dYskYaa	I was sad to hear about it. I found out our brothers and sisters were on the plane about a week and a half ago.<br>  A sister here in Georgia told me.  She knew them.

It blew out all her windows.|`|4fffa6bae2775acc0a4469d4a0d63b20aa	Wow, I'm so sorry.  It sounds like they were a wonderful family.  I am looking forward to meeting them in paradise when they are resurrected, when Jehovah God through his son Christ Jesus will "wipe out every tear" from our eyes. (Rev. 21:4)  I am sure they'll feel honored to find out that their memorial service was held in a place such as the Stanley Theatre assembly hall, and that so many people cared about them and remembered them so fondly.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Ah, I get it now.  I was thinking you meant that you knew them personally. :)  They of course are my family too. :)|`|UPgLy0Ahaa	I'm so-o sorry for your loss. :( <br>  I had no idea our spiritual friends were on the plane until now.<br>  My prayers go out to you and the familiy of the victims.<br>  <br>  Philia'<br>  JehovahServant Girl<br>  <br>  To the avatar *Dan the Man* if you have a heart at all, you'd edit your comment for the good.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	Even the Governor of New Jersey was able to attend and extend his condolences to the families.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	The two countries are actually very close culturally and share a great deal of traditions and beliefs.<br>  Historically it was Italy that influenced France. For instance the Renaissance started in Italy and spread northwards, though the subsequent rococo style originated in France. The smooth,  streamlined and uncluttered modern Italian style has only taken off fairly recently in France where interiors are still full of inherited peraphernalia, traditional furniture, souvenirs and ornaments.<br>    <br>  Obviously, despite similitudes, the language is different, and Italy still has many local dialects: Central Italian, Florentine language, Friulian language, Lombard language, Milanese, Neapolitan language, Romanesco, Sardinian language, Sicilian language, Tuscan dialect, Tuscan language, Venetian language. France lost many of its local dialects after WW1. There also are more local traditions still respected in Italy than in France. This is due to the fact that Italy only became a single unified state in 1870.<br>  <br>  The Italians are still deeply religious, still believe in marriage rather than "living together", and divorce  was not permitted by law till the 1970's, whilst "la?cité" is the  French concept of a secular society, and  divorce was allowed there much earlier, going back to the French revolution nearly two hundred years previously. Church attendance is much higher in Italy than in France where the number of priests has dropped enormously and many churches have to share one priest with services performed in alternate churches. In Italy women are requested to enter chuches " decently attired", namely no bare arms (shawls are lent at the entrance of larger churches to unprepared tourists)  and neither shorts nor mini skirts with bare legs.<br>  Despite impressions that Italians are more "laid back", they actually are less "laissez faire" and more straight-laced than the French, though they still are great romantics. They take a dim view of public nudity for instance, whilst "topless" is accepted on French beaches. <br>  <br>  However, the great tradition of singing, which gave rise to the vast quantity of amazing Italian operas, is still very much part of the Italian culture, and every family still boasts a few "singers" who perform at weddings and family reunions. The French on the whole are more subdued, less demonstrative, and prefer not to make fools of themselves in public.<br>  <br>  Both countries tend to stick to their traditional dishes, foodwise, with more emphasis on pasta in Italy whilst the French, although they do eat some noodles and spaghetti, prefer to use potatoes with their meat dishes. Sweetcorn tends to be considered animal food in France, whilst in Italy it is frequently served as Polenta. Pizza that was popularised in the USA through Italian immigration is actually eaten more frequently in UK than it is in France. The French do not go in for the large variety of coffees offered in Italy and alcohol-wise prefer Cognac and Armagnac to Italian Grappa or Limoncello after a meal.|`|2b27c4496c4784176510cc9ec0ab88abaa	The same difference between a fish and a Cow....<br>  <br>  But for sure Italian often cheat in soccer....|`|zEoRcL91aa	Lots - we only ask that sort of question to tease, like what is the difference between Greeks and Turks ;)<br>  <br>  Diff between It and Fr - language, history, art, architecture, food.
