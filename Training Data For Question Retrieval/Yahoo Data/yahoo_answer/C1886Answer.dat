F0sSROOxaa	Code looks fine. Your prn_it() function reverses the user's input correctly.<br>  <br>  However, if you need the "Reversed order: " prefix to appear, there are probably several ways you can go about it. Here's my take:<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  #include <stdio.h><br>  <br>  bool prefixShownFlag = false;<br>  <br>  void prn_it(void)<br>  {<br>  char c;<br>  if((c=getchar())!='\n')<br>  prn_it();<br>  <br>  if (!prefixShownFlag)<br>  {<br>  prefixShownFlag = true;<br>  printf("Reversed order: ");<br>  }<br>  <br>  if (c!='\n')<br>  putchar(c);<br>  }<br>  int main()<br>  {<br>  printf("Input no.: ");<br>  prn_it();<br>  printf("\n\n");<br>  return 0;<br>  }<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Not the cleanest of examples, but it does get it done. <br>  <br>  P.s. I have a feeling I'm answering your programming homework. If I'm wrong, welcome to programming. If I'm right, at the very least, please try to understand what the code is doing. And welcome to programming.<br>  <br>  [Edit]<br>  Another note: the code that you have provided is pretty "clever", using recursion to print the input in reverse order. However, my advice is to stay away from "clever" code. It's almost never worth the trouble (unless you're doing it purely for fun).<br>  <br>  Another solution (that would be easier to understand) is to use a stack, and do away with recursion completely. Its LIFO property makes it ideal for solving your problem<br>  <br>  [Reply]<br>  The boolean is (what I think, is called) a flag. It's a quick-and-dirty solution, and will fail any subsequent calls unless modified. <br>  <br>  In my defense (for posting a direct answer):<br>  <br>  * The code in question is already working (correctly reversing user input). I simply hacked together a solution to display the output exactly as requested.<br>  <br>  * From experience, if someone has really done their best and still can't accomplish what they need, it's sometimes benefitial to let them in to the answer AND the concepts/thought process used. <br>  <br>  In any case, that's all from me. Wish you the best in your studies. And once again, welcome to programming! Hope you enjoy it as much as we do, and NEVER ever code like how I just did.|`|ebuxHnScaa	There's no code to reverse anything in there.<br>  <br>  Here's a hint: You want to output the last digit of the number first. The last digit of a base ten number is always that number modulo ten. Then you can 'shift off' the last digit by dividing by ten.<br>  <br>  For example, take 143:<br>  143%10    -> 3<br>  143/10=14<br>  14%10      -> 4<br>  14/10=1<br>  1%10        -> 1<br>  1/10 = 0<br>  Notice the output is "341", exactly what you want.<br>  <br>  Update: WOW! That code really does reverse the input string, but it does it in a very, very odd way, using recursion and the stack. That's a very advanced concept and it's really not worth you trying to understand it right now.<br>  <br>  Basically, it works like a stack of plates where you can only add/remove plates at the top of the stack. If it gets "143", it puts a 1 plate on a stack, then a 4 plate on a stack, then a 3 plate on the stack. Then, it pops plates off the top of the stick printing out their numbers as it does so.<br>  <br>  After "143", the 3 plate is on the top of the stack (since it was put on last), so it prints the 3 first. Then the 4 plate is on top, and so on.<br>  <br>  It's so subtle, I didn't even notice it.|`|1vv3KvS8aa	the answer i have in mind is to use arrays.. so that each number inputted will be stored in different indexes of the array then you can get your desired output by printing the array backwards (starting with the highest index to the lowest...)<br>  <br>  !!! i don't really know if my answer is correct.. so still refer to other answers. !!!|`|7Sm9iB6Jaa	This is complicative.u can use a simple prog of a palindrome.

qs9QHvy9aa	I just set mine up last night on my new computer, I know the answer to this.<br>  <br>  First, you need a static IP on your computer.  There are two types of static IP's, one is an outbound static, and one is a LAN static.  The outbound static (which you don't need) costs money and is set up by your internet provider.  The other, is a static IP address for your computer on your own LAN.  It will be something like 192.168.1.xxx  I used 192.168.1.103 for mine.  <br>  <br>  Once thats set up, you need to figure out which port your torrent program uses.  Then log into your router, and set up port forwarding for that port, so that it directs it to your LAN static IP'd computer.<br>  <br>  Once thats done, you should be getting all the speed your going to get.

How pathetic it is to be a company selling security software of all types and claiming there products to do well and get their site hacked.

But I personally would recommend installing ClamWin, Spywareblaster and Spybot: Search and Destroy (with Tea Timer installed). ClamWin is the windows "port" of the famous anti-virus server software, but the downside is they still haven't got a on-access scanner (they are still developing it). Spybot blocks any sites and redirectors set by malwares on windows computers. spybot is also a scanner and site blocker.

Domain names better dont get involved, let your client deal with it or help him but in the end let them own it and have the control on it.|`|0wUwKbHsaa	Ditto what was said before.  Being a web host is an entirely different beast than developing a website.  Web developers and designers simply do that aspect and will work within the limitations given to them.  For example, a company may want to host their own website on their own computers and will only offer the ability to use JSP.  They will find a developer who is comfortable with that.  Other companies will want you to do the legwork to find the host.  That's fine, many developers will do that as well.|`|0IDasalAaa	Making money from domain registration and web hosting is a source of revenue often overlooked by web designers.

Maybe a low end PC for basic uses, or a high end one for gaming, or all in one PC. Again, in Macs you get what you get..|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	For style, Macs cannot be beaten. Macs have beautiful exteriors. The magnetic cords are pure genius. The internal hardware is identical that in Windows PCs. So all that crap about "Macs have superior hardware" is a bunch of hooey. Macs have the same interior hardware (hard drives, optical drives, processors) as Windows PCs.<br>  <br>  Macs tend to use the highest screen resolution available for the screen size, and Mac OS X generally uses very high-resolution program icons, so when you do that mouseover magnification effect, you don't see pixelated icons.<br>  <br>  In terms of features, Macs do all the basics that Linux and Windows PCs do. iPhoto manages your photos. Mail is your mail client. Safari is your browser until you replace it with a better one (Camino, Firefox, or Opera). iTunes manages your music. Just as with a Windows PC, you'll have to install an office suite, but there is a free one available--NeoOffice, which is the Mac-native version of OpenOffice.<br>  <br>  Macs are not any easier to use than Windows PCs, but that doesn't really matter anyway, since "easy" is subjective, and people tend to get familiar with even difficult or counterintuitive tasks pretty quickly (how long did it take you to memorize the Control-Alt-Delete key combination or to go to the Start menu to "end" the computer or shut it down?). Several things in the Mac interface are very annoying, especially if you're used to the Windows interface:<br>  <br>  1. The plus sign on windows does this thing called "zoom" (except in iTunes, where you'll transform the window into a "mini-player" and back again) instead of maximizing the window. Presumably, this changes the shape of the window to exactly fit its contents, except that in Finder's column view, you'll still get truncated filenames displayed... and if you change documents or webpages to something that requires another shape, you'll have to press the zoom button again to resize things.<br>  2. There's no easy keyboard navigation for the top menu (no equivalent of Alt in Windows)<br>  3. There is a universal toolbar at the top of the screen, which is another one of those "nice in theory" things, but it's annoying if you have a very large screen (say, an Apple Cinema Display or extended desktop), since the menu for applications will be far away from the windows for those same applications.<br>  4. You can't cut and paste in Finder. Or you can but it's not intuitive. You have to look up how to do it.<br>  <br>  Some advantages:<br>  <br>  1. Mac OS X has a beautiful interface with very smooth animation.<br>  2. Even though OS X has a point-and-click interface on the surface, underneath there is a sophisticated Unix-like filesystem hierarchy and a fully functional bash shell for terminal commands.<br>  3. Software installation isn't as easy as Linux distros' package management, but drag and drop into the Applications folder (once you get used to it) is at least easier than the setup.exe-next-next-next-next-finish routine in Windows. Unfortunately, a few software packages for Mac OS X do make you jump through the installation wizard hoops.<br>  4. If you buy into the whole Apple experience (and can afford it), it's nice how everything is guaranteed to work together (Apple TV, iPhone, Apple Airport Extreme, Macbook, Apple Cinema Display).<br>  <br>  As for security, Macs aren't invincible. No operating system is invincible. If you're connected to the internet, there's always the possibility your computer can be compromised. Macs' security defaults are better than Windows'. Windows makes you administrator by default, which means if there's any kind of security breach, it immediately has access to the entire system. It also means security breaches are harder to clean up, as you can't just delete the compromised account--you have to reinstall the entire operating system. Windows also has more autorun features and integration between its web browser and the operating system (good, old Internet Explorer), not to mention that it hides file extensions by default (making it easier for malicious files to appear harmless).<br>  <br>  You can secure Windows. Most people don't, though, because a secured Windows isn't very convenient to use (every tried administering your system using Run As from a limited user account?). So instead of securing Windows, they run useless "antivirus" software in the hopes that nothing bad will happen.<br>  <br>  Antivirus software is flawed, though, as it is in a constant arms race against newer threats. If a new threat appears, your antivirus won't automatically have updated definitions to detect that threat or remove it. And if it tries to guess viruses instead by behavior, it ends up with a lot of false positives and makes people generally paranoid ("A tracking cookie? I have a tracking cookie? How do I get rid of it?").<br>  <br>  The truth, though, is that the biggest security threat isn't the software. It's the user. Most users have no idea what's secure or insecure. They download software from all sorts of untrustworthy sources and then get all flustered|`|AA10954273	Do you mean the actual iMac?  It's underpowered, overpriced and can't be expanded.|`|kWxhWET7aa	13's got a good point, but here's another one.<br>  <br>  The Mac doesn't have the best hardware installed, but since the hardware for the Mac is predefined, the operating system, and programs written for the thing tend to run a lot faster than PC programs. That's simply because designers don't have to worry about little hardware nuances when developing software.<br>  <br>  Still, I'm PC and don't care who knows it. There are a lot of people out there that swear by the Mac because it's great for 'artists' or whatever. But the truth is you can do whatever you want on just about whatever machine you choose, as long as you know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  The only exception to this rule is that sometimes you have to build a PC around a given interest, for example, gaming or office. If you want a gaming PC, then the little weak graphics card that came with your motherboard isn't gonna cut it, but you don't need DirectX 10+ compliant SLI graphics cards with pixel shader 3.0 for and office PC either.<br>  <br>  The choice is yours.

ebuxHnScaa	MOVs and fuses do completely different things. You can remove the MOV, but if you connect a fuse there, the fuse will just instantly blow.<br>  <br>  MOVs sit across a voltage. If that voltage suddenly increases, the MOV will very, very quickly absorb the increase in voltage before it can damage a connected device.<br>  <br>  Fuses, on the other hand, have the load current passing through them. If the load current exceeds the fuse's rated load, the fuse blows. Fuses are typically at least a hundred times slower than a MOV and are more to prevent a short from creating a fire than for protecting devices.<br>  <br>  So again, MOVs sit across the circuit, fuses have the load current pass through them. MOVs are very, very fast. Fuses are much slower. Fuses prevent fires. MOVs protect electronics from being damaged by surges or spikes.<br>  <br>  Fuses and MOVs both fail open. A failed fuse causes the circuit not to work. A failed MOV leaves you with no protection.<br>  <br>  Replace the MOV with a new MOV of the same voltage rating.

SJM0rzHtaa	If possible, try connecting the LCD to the computer using a digital connection, via the TV's HDMI port.  An LCD TV's HDMI port can be connected to a computer's DVI port using a DVI-to-HDMI cable, and if the computer has an HDMI port, one can use a standard HDMI cable.  DVI/HDMI is a digital signal (everything else like VGA, composite, S-video, etc. are analog), and the digital connection might work better.

I have listed two pages from w3schools.  The first gives you lots of information about forms.  The second is a real world example on sending a form through e-mail where you can edit it and try it for yourself.<br>  <br>  Note that you need server side processing for form information to be sent to you without invoking a client side e-mail application.  Server side processing could be done in PHP, JSP, or ASP (just to name a few).<br>  <br>  Good luck.

The usually start with "Teach yourself" then give a date range for instance "Teach Yourself Perl in 24 hours". The 24 hour series of books allow the more advanced user to tackle the subject in a day whilst there is also 21 day series that allows a more relaxed approach. Your best bet is to get down to a book store have a look at each and see which suits your learning style. All the books are styled in the same teaching manner which means if you have a copy of any it should be fine to assess yourself you can then order the copy you want online.

xERzGZ6Baa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

RjwyRrxtaa	If your computer always restart, There are some reason:<br>  I. It's Hot in There<br>  Sometimes this can be caused by an overheating situation. Itunes, RealPlayer, Windows Media player,etc. require a lot of processing power to decompress and decode music files, which can cause the processor or hard drive to get hot.<br>  Memory Fails Me...<br>  If you determine that overheating is not the problem, the most likely suspect is bad memory.<br>  II. Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III. Computer Restarts After Download?<br>  <br>  This can also be a virus or spyware problem. I suggest you go through your Control Panel / Add or Remove Programs list and remove any programs you don't need, then run thorough anti-virus and anti-spyware scans.

It might be that you have so many hardware attached on your computer but you never upgrade the power supply<br>  <br>  THIRD:<br>  Motherboard, some internal error on your mother board, it's rare but might be the reason somtimes.

jQBM2AGkaa	Which IP address are you pinging? If it's 0ms, it sounds like you're pinging the router or the loopback. Pinging a website IP would give a larger time. Try pinging bbc.co.uk and then 212.58.224.138 (BBC's IP address). This will tell you if you're connected to the internet. If you aren't connected, try a direct connection to the modem and try again. Also, check for a static IP. Virgin's IP addresses are dynamic and assigned by DHCP.<br>  <br>  Also, when you have a direct connection to the modem, type in ipconfig to command prompt and find out your IP address (IPv4 on Vista). If it starts 169, remove the thick white cable from your modem and restart it (by pulling the power cable out and putting it back). Get your IP address again (with the white cable still removed). If it begins 192, connect the modem up again and restart it. You should then get a valid IP (for virgin it'll begin with a number between 60 and 80, most likely). Then connect your router back up, turn both the router and the modem off. Turn on the modem and wait for the lights to settle (depending on your modem, it'll be either the Online (motorola) the Cable (surfboard) or the Ready (ambit). Only then turn your router on. <br>  <br>  If you can ping a website but not connect, try restoring the defaults on your browser. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. If it doesn't work, you'll need to contact D-LINK or check further on your PC.|`|9Jgp8ffSaa	It seems you already have the information I was going to send.|`|NO5ThKw4aa	when changing a connection to a virginmedia cable modem it has to be switched off and the on again with the new device attached, this is because it maps itself to the MAC address of the first device, when powered back on again it will remap to the new device. so basically switch off modem disconnect old router, connect new router then switch on modem, wait for lights to synchronise then try connecting to internet.

AA11236094	Let's cover the operations here.<br>  <br>  You click on a tab that had been downloaded earlier, going back to the pages you were working on some time ago.  IE stores what had been downloaded to that tab in your computers' RAM.  <br>  <br>  When Windows needs more RAM for other applications, or for the other pages in the open tabs,  Windows swaps that RAM location with a temporary RAM on your Hard Drive known as the (wait for it), Swap File.<br>  <br>  Now, IE has tools, called pointers, that tell it where to find the pages it left stored in RAM.  And, Windows should be nice, and redirect those pointers to the swap file.  But, windows isn't always nice, and sometimes the swap file gets overwritten as you use more program or memory resources.<br>  <br>  So, IE freezes because it cannot find the pages it loaded earlier for the tab you are clicking.  This is known as windows behaving badly, and occurs more often on older systems, with less RAM, fewer CPU resources, and old versions of Windows and IE.  There are other reasons IE could freeze up, but this is the most common.<br>  <br>  The fix for this, the best solution without a major computer and windows upgrade, is to switch to FireFox, which is a well-behaved browser, or perhaps to Opera, which is also well behaved.  Personally, I use FireFox on Windows, and Opera on Linux.<br>  <br>  If you are desperate to use IE, then get Windows Vista 64 bit Premium or Ultimate, with at least 4 GB of RAM, and these problems will mostly go away (others may crop up, but that's Windows for ya).|`|PyEhrC08aa	it can be for a variety of reasons, but most likely, you don't have a lot of RAM, so it gets stuck, or freezes :)

ELF5Y6IQaa	In cell d1 you put this formula<br>  <br>  =b1*c1<br>  <br>  Then you just copy the formula down. There are many ways to copy.

But, as long as column C has entries (including 0) that continue to the last row you want calculated, you'll find AutoFill is MUCH easier than good ol' Copy/Paste.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11541242	That's a cinch!<br>  <br>  Step 1 - In cell D1 type: =B1*C1<br>  Step 2 - Hit enter<br>  Step 3 - Copy cell D1<br>  Step 4 - Highlight cells D2:D20<br>  Step 5 - Paste<br>  <br>  That should do the trick.

7ToeKBzYaa	Hi dude,<br>  Immediately check your CPU fan health, Did you over-clocked your CPU? if so please rollback to the previous state, it's going to damage your CPU.<br>  <br>  Highest acceptable temperature is about 40 degrees Centigrade.<br>  ============<br>  You're right friend, but this is for professionals who have professional CPU and do professional tasks, If he do professional tasks which are causing a CPU high load then you're absolutely right.<br>  ---------------------<br>  Dear friend, he has added that additional detail after my answer's edit. As you see I said "I think.." I did not said anything like exactly 3.2v or absolutely 3.2v, so take it easy man.<br>  ============<br>  Check everything with your fan be right, CPU temperature depends on many factors such as your room's temperature, CPU tasks, case position, fan power, case physical style and etc... .<br>  so check everything and if nothing happened, take your computer to a local costumer service.<br>  <br>  * Something more, In some cases a damaged power supply can cause CPU voltage to changed in an unwanted way. so while you're checking your CPU temperature, check its core voltage too, I think it must be between 3.1500 V and 3.2500V.<br>  <br>  good luck...|`|RRBv9zIVaa	That's somewhat high, but within a acceptable range.

xERzGZ6Baa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements.

Well, in any case, the more ram you have, the better. I'd install as much RAM as it will take. You need to find specifications of your laptop (owners manual will be a good place to look) and see what is the maximum amount of RAM this particular laptop will take.<br>  As for switching to XP, it's a good idea because XP is better Operating System than Win98, but it needs more Ram than Win98. <br>  Lets say you have only 128 MB of RAM. Win98 will run OK, but XP will run very slow. But if you have at lest 512 MB of RAM (and more is better) XP will run well. <br>  Also, a real drag on your system is a bunch of programs running in the background. I bet you have some running all the time and you don't even know about them. Investigate what is running all the time in the background and get rid of the programs you don't need.|`|Fk3TupqVaa	You can use a registry cleaner to clean up your computer and then make your computer faster,Why?the reason is that there may be some registry errors and remnant,corrupt files and temp files in your computer to cause "computer slow".<br>  Every time you install and uninstall software on your computer and surfing online you create junk in the computer registry.over time, the registry can grow to enormous proportions, especially if the various programs you've installed do not do a good job of deleting and/or updating it's Registry entries.You need to scan and clean your computer with registry cleaner to make it fast.Good Registry Cleaner will improve your computer and Internet performance dramatically!<br>  There are some comparison and review of TOP 5 registry cleaners.<br>  <a href="http://www.speed-up-my-computer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.speed-up-my-computer.com</a><br>  You can download and scan your computer for free.|`|lOg4fEiCaa	Go to <a href="http://www.pc-optimizer-pro-download.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pc-optimizer-pro-download.com</a><br>  With pc optimizer pro you can safely clean, repair and optimize your computer.<br>  It will help improve your system performance without expensive hardware upgrades.|`|VPCl2C9daa	it will make it slower, as xp needs more of everything to run well than 98 does, install more ram, that will make 98 run smoother.

PBFD1Do3aa	Well I just bought the game and was sort of disappointed because my computer cannot even run it on High. (The graphics go from "Low" to "Ultra")<br>  My specs:<br>  2.7 GHz AMD Athlon 64 X2 5200+<br>  XFX GeForce 8600GT (1GB)<br>  2 RAM (1066)<br>  Power supply 350 watts<br>  <br>  I need at least 2GB more of RAM and a much better graphics card. I'm going to wait until I can afford a GeForce 200 series, but I understand if you're desperate. It's a great game and you want to play it like Creative Assembly. I'd recommend a 9800GT. (Check the dimensions to see if there is enough room).<br>  <br>  Newegg is selling XFX version for $110 with free shipping:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150316" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Make sure that your power supply is at least 400 watts though. I ran into that problem and wondered why the computer emitted a beep code and wouldn't proceed to the bios.<br>  <br>  As for RAM, it's best to use the same manufacturer's cards that your computer currently uses, provided that you aren't experiencing problems. I use Crucial (two 1GB sticks).|`|bcqS54bfaa	1gb of ram is fine. For the card i wold get a 8600gt it can play any game out on high settings and its only $60. But you have to make sure you have a 380watt power supply.|`|cW3t6f6naa	Go to newegg.com And if i were you i would get  the 8800gt, 9800gt or the  9600 gt as i have a 8600gt and i can play games like crysis on high/very high settings. But i can barely play empire total war on medium..... You should get another gig or 2 for ram. I have 2 gigs and it still laggs horribly on low... the designers made it so you have to have a top of the line gaming computer to play it which is bullsh*t.. and on medium settings it looks worse than medievil 2 total war and i could play that game on ultra with ease and get about 70 fps. but on empire total war i can only get about 25 if that, then around 5 when i zoom in. sooo yeah.... sorry if i'm blabbering i'm just so pissed that i can't play the game hardly. But if you can go with the 9800gt it's the best for it's price. which is around 120$ and is alot better than any of the others i told you.

Hit enter again to confirrm the new (blank) password, and you should be good to go.   <br>  <br>  This does however, leave your computer open to tampering by others who have physical access to the machine.<br>  <br>  I would NEVER leave the account password blank without first setting a password on the Administrators account if you have one.<br>  <br>  IF your password is already blank - then you need to check in two locations to see if the system has been told to always ask for the password.<br>  <br>  Look in the screen saver settings in the Display control panel.  There is an option there to force asking for the password when the machine leaves sleep mode.  Booting runs some of the same sub-routines and can trigger this.<br>  <br>  In the Power setting control panel, there are similar settings to ask for a password when windows has been in suspend or hybrination mode.

However he fell flat on his face with the length limitations.  The wired Ethernet standard allows for an absolute wire length between device ports of 100 meters.  This is due to the timing of the Ethernet signaling, not attenuation.  Even a few inches past 100 meters will cause noticeable speed degradation and a few meters past 100 may bring the segment down entirely.<br>  <br>  100 meters is 328 feet.|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	Get ye a switch, and don't worry about the length. You can go another 100 feet or so before you have to worry. The switch starts it all over again so you won't have any problems unless the squeeze box is in ANOTHER neighbors house. You COULD also stick a Wireless access point (not router) on the end of that wire instead of a switch, and then you would have your wireless cake, and fork to eat it with too.

You need a better CPU, RAM, hard drive, or video card.|`|xERzGZ6Baa	Clean windows registry means faster PC performance. The registry is one of the most valuable sections of your PC. This is where important information and directories relating to installed software, hardware, temporary files downloaded from the Internet, created documents and folders, and other minor and minor applications are stored.<br>  <br>  Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software's, install new devices, download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system. This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the windows registry however is quite risky so these reminders might be a great help before you begin.<br>  <br>  1. Before you clean the registry, be sure you really now how and what you are doing. If you are in doubt and just plain curious, you better consult a professional IT. This is for you and your computer's security.<br>  <br>  2. It is very important to create a back up of all you files before cleaning the windows registry so if the worse thing happens, your files are safe.<br>  <br>  3. Find a reliable registry cleaning software on the net. You can either download a free ware or purchase it. A good registry cleaning software is one that includes multiple features - defragmenter, PC scan, junk file remover, uninstaller, and RAM optimizer.<br>  <br>  Now that you know what it takes to clean windows registry doesn't mean you can do this all by yourself, unless you are an IT professional.<br>  <br>  For more information on free Windows registry repair visit the site.<br>  <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>

However, a Google Search to 'change static ip' should provide you some results.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|wTwppABQaa	Yes, it all depends on your ISP, if you want to change, you have to be more specefic on what kinda of internet service provider you have and if you are on a modem or router.|`|mbHZ10ZZaa	You can change your lan ip any time you want.  Your public ip is different.  Most ISP's use dynamic ip's, which can change at any time without warning, but you can't change it yourself.|`|AA11083623	Yes it is possible.|`|uCzSEgT6aa	Depends.  Some ISP's give you a new IP every now and then (or at every log in with dial-up).  Others give you an IP and will only allow you to access the internet from that IP, so if you do change it you won't have internet access.  Other times they base it on your MAC address, so using a different network card, or using MAC address cloning in your router's options will give you a new IP.|`|5JxIS9n1aa	no, you cant change it<br>  <br>  if you want to, change your modem(DSL, yadda yadda)

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.<br>  <br>  There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.<br>  <br>  Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.<br>  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist. <br>  <br>  You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.<br>  <br>  Your risking your computer rights/detention/suspension by trying to bypass their security.|`|oZydD2rsaa	Here's a free proxy created today:<br>   <br>  <a href="http://isgreat.info/2a/" rel="nofollow">http://isgreat.info/2a/</a><br>  <br>  -Unblock ANY Website<br>  -watch youtube videos<br>  -download up to 100 MB<br>  -hide you IP and stay anonymous<br>  -Fast and hosted on a dedicated server<br>  <br>  I get new proxies here everyday:<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxies">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxie...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  Email me if it's not working and i'll email you a proxy that I haven't advertised yet|`|TDepUOYWaa	Hm... try my personal proxy - <a href="http://proxyfreely.com/" rel="nofollow">http://proxyfreely.com/</a> <br>  Hope it help you.

Bring your cloud background into the stage area and create the animation with keyframes of your clouds moving sideways using motion tweening. Play it to test it out.

IbxhRebgaa	We're running out of IPv4 addresses. With IPv6, we can assign obscenely enormous IP blocks to government agencies and corporations without running out of addresses. That's the basic advantage in my opinion. Hell, with IPv6, my ISP could, in theory, assign me the equivalent of a class-A IP block if it made sense financially (obviously, it doesn't; that's the only reason I don't have a class-A block - not because of shortages of addresses).<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just to give you an idea of the severe shortage of IPv4 addresses, the number of possible IPv4 addresses is 2^32 which equals 4,294,967,296<br>  <br>  When you think of how many individuals and organisations require IP addresses,  that's clearly not enough to cover them all. <br>  <br>  The number of IPv6 addresses is 2^128 which equals 3.402823669 x 10^38<br>  <br>  That will be enough for the foreseeable future.|`|Pv4Z88wPaa	<a href="http://www.networkdictionary.com/networking/IPv6vsIPv4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.networkdictionary.com/network...</a>

V1qHYfUfaa	Every piece of software is going to have some kind of exploit, but there are several things you can do in order to keep yourself safe no matter what PC or operating system you use.<br>  <br>  1. Be careful what type of sites you visit. There are many unscrupulous websites out there that will readily infect your machine with a virus or adware.<br>  <br>  2. Instead of downloading music, go to the store and buy the CD or buy the MP3’s from legit sites. Not only will you avoid any financially difficult legal situation, you'll also avoid any website that promises free MP3 downloads but only delivers viruses and adware.<br>  <br>  3. Instead of looking for software cracks or serials online, look for coupons. The "crackz" scene is filled to the brim with malicious websites. You're not safe when you're visiting these "seedier" websites.<br>  <br>  4. Do not run in Administrator mode. You should only run in Administrator mode when you're installing hardware or software, but running in a lower security mode you'll avoid a lot of the more invasive attacks.|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Do not use Limewire.<br>  =<br>  No Limewire, No virus.

IFtV7g2Zaa	I don't have cricket, but I like their price.<br>  <br>  The device is probably manufactured by somebody else, like Motorola.  Therefore the experience when using cricket's broadband adapter should be similar to the experience using other provider's broadband adapters.I have customers that use it to connect to their office networks via a VPN connection.  Its fast enough for email, and sending / receiving files to/from the office.<br>  <br>  The broadband adapters on other services are sufficiently fast for most Internet uses.  But, you need to assess where you're going to be using it.  <br>  1) 3G speeds are only available in very limited areas.  To get the fastest possible connection speed you need to be in those area.<br>  2) All broadband adapters only work where there is digital service.  If you're going "out into the sticks", you probably won't have any connection -- even on your cell phone.<br>  <br>  I've connected several broadband adapters for folks on Sprint/Nextel.  They work great.<br>  <br>  Pros: no contracts, no credit checks, make your own hot spot, connection nearly always available, use your vonage device/phone anywhere your laptop is, over your cricket adapter.<br>  <br>  Cons: digital only, cricket has limited coverage, $59 device charge is online price only, requires $118 paid up-front with a $50 mail in rebate<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Edit: There are no boundaries like state or county lines.  You can go anywhere that you could go with a cell phone, provided there is digital cellular service there, AND cricket has a reciprocal agreement with that area's local digital cellular provider.  You probably won't be able to go out of the country.  Verify that cricket has service in the areas where you will use the adapter, before you buy it.|`|47g0IZXFaa	i heard u cant go out of state  but one person went to another state like 3 hours away and thats how far it work and another went to a small town like 2 hours away and it would work

As you did not mention which version of Excel you are using, I will try to find a generic way to set things up for you...There are definitely shorter ways of doing this, but I am trying to keep everything simple for you.<br>  <br>  You have to set up a start time and an end time in two separate cells...for example A2 put in 1:00, in cell A3 put in 9:00.  In cell A4 put in =A3-A2.  This should add up the cell values.  It should now show 8:00.  In cell A5 put in 0:30.  In cell A6 put in =A4-A5.  It should now show 7:30.  If I try to add all this up I will get a weird result.  So I have to change things a bit now.  In cell A7 put in =HOUR(A6).  It should now show 7.  In cell A8 put =A7+.5 .  This will add that half hour you need and show 7.5.<br>  <br>  So now we have the generic shift information.  To copy it, click in the middle of cell A2, hold down your mouse and drag to cell A8.  You should see A2 with a black border and all the others with a black background.  Right click and go copy.  Select the FIRST cell of all the other columns you need this info for...B2, C2, etc all the way to H2 using the same method I showed to select the A2 group.  Once you have that, right click and paste.  All of the other columns should have the info you need now.  <br>  <br>  Now you want to add it all up.  Click on the cell I8 and the go up into your toolbar and look for an icon that looks like a funny looking E.  If you rest your mouse on it, without clicking on it, it should say Autosum.  Click in the middle of the E.  It should now have highlighted A8 to H8.  Click on your "Enter" key.  It should now show you 56, which is the sum of all the hours in this case.<br>  <br>  Now this is the sum off ALL the days.  If you don't want it to add certain columns, just select the entire column as shown above (D2-D8, for example) and click on your "Delete" key.  This will remove that info from your spreadsheet.   If you want to move things around, say next week, it's C2 instead of D2 that's off, then select all of the C cells (C2-C8) and right click on it and "Cut".  Then click on D2 and right click and "Paste".  <br>  <br>  As I mentioned before, this is not the fastest way to do this, but it is the most straight forward way for someone with little experience with Excel.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Fac|`|dGCrFDjXaa	the best way to deal with these are to enter the actual times you work/etc in the cells (i.e. - 7.5 hours). Then you can run the formula "=sum(A2:H2)" and it would total all of these. <br>  <br>  I would recommend you go about it this way and set the x-axis (row 1) to the date and the y-axis (column 1) to be the shift you are working. <br>  <br>  The only other way to do it in your instance would be to enter the formula "=9-1-[enter your break time taken]" and this would still only show your hours worked. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and if you need additional help please message me directly. Take care, <br>  -G|`|yczfFQXmaa	If you're going to be working different hours and want this to work for you long-term, I would set up different rows with your time in, time out and and length of lunch.  Then it would be pretty easy to set up a formula to tell you how much time you worked.<br>  <br>  So make Row 2 "Time in", Row 3 "Time out" and Row 4 "Lunch time".  Enter your schedule, making sure that you enter as number of hours (so if you take a half hour break, enter 0.5; if you clock in at 1:30, enter 1.5).  Also if you're going to be working sometimes before noon, you should use military time or the math won't work.<br>  <br>  Now you can set up a formula in Row 5 for total time worked.  In column A (which you may need to shift to B so you can label your rows) you would enter "=A3-A2-A4"  That should give you your total hours worked.  Do this for each row or just drag that cell over across Row 5 to fill in the rest. (If you're not familiar with Excel, when you select a cell a little black box will be in the lower right corner.  You can click on this and drag it to the right and it will copy the formula to those cells, but adjusting to use the numbers from that column).<br>  <br>  Now if you want the total hours for the week, add another box and use the summation feature.  Click on the AutoSum button on the toolbar (The capital sigma) or just enter =SUM() and then highlight between the parentheses and highlight all your totals for each day.
3GmG8uQzaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"<br>  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|95jGqw2Gaa	I also stuck when my pc crash.<br>  i use registryFix to repair it.<br>  it works<br>  you can go to <a href="http://www.make-pc-faster.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.make-pc-faster.com/</a>|`|WeQzNwLbaa	try to restore or repair ur system. if it doesn't work, u might have an hardware problem. maybe the temperatures are high or maybe there is a problem with some Other parts.

ZvkUBNOtaa	I need some more information.  Is it a PS2 or a USB keyboard?  PS2's use the round nine pin connectors and USB's use the flat connector.  If it's a PS2, then you need to replace the keyboard, simple as that. <br>  <br>  Most likely if you get a keyboard failure at boot on the POST (Power On Self Test) and you can unplug it and plug it back in to hit F1 and continue, it's not a PS2 keyboard.  Do you have to restart your computer after unplugging and plugging back in the keyboard?<br>  <br>  If it's a USB keyboard you need to enter the BIOS setup controls to turn on Legacy USB.  Different computer manufacturers and motherboard makers use different means to get to the BIOS setup, but most likely there will be a notice that says something like "Hit Del to enter setup", or "Hit F2 to enter setup" when your computer first starts.  It's usually in the bottom left corner of the screen and it's not there for very long.<br>  <br>  Once you get into the BIOS setup program you need to look for something that says "Enable USB Legacy Devices" or "Enable USB 1.0, 2.0, ALL" etc.  You're looking for a USB control to turn on because most likely the motherboard is set to use only USB 2.0 and your keyboard is a 1.x device.  You want to get as broad a range of USB turned on as you can.<br>  <br>  If you try all that and have any trouble or need more help, I'll check back later today to see if you've added any additional information .  It would really help to know the motherboard manufacturer and model, or the exact model of computer and manufacturer, if you're using a USB or PS2 keyboard, and at what point during the boot process you get the error message.  Can you hit  F1 and continue to boot after plugging in the keyboard?|`|DJoQnwNbaa	did you spill something on it? are the cable broken or in the wrong slots? if its no to both answers get a new one might be a problem with the keyboard or ur computer go to start>control panel>performance and mantainance>administration tool>event viewer>system>errors>and next time that same pop up appears check there it might answer u why its not registering|`|aX4QrA4Iaa	ummm first of all u said quote: "(says "keyboard Failure)" its supposed to be: "(says "keyboard Failure")"<br>  <br>  alright for the anwser. all you have to do is keep plugging it back in. make sure thers nothing that could possiably be pulling the wire out. if there is, eliminate that threat

So...the difference between the 7600 and the 9600 is the 9600 is overclocked, has more memory, and, is $200 more expensive.<br>  <br>  Is the card passively cooled, or is it fan cooled?<br>  If passively cooled...you may have issues with compatability, which means the card may be drawing more power than it should. (And it likely is, which explains the heat.)<br>  If it is fan cooled, make sure that your fans are working properly.<br>  <br>  Also, you could have a virus. Or, the particular unique card's bugs may involve thinking it is an X-box 360 (aka: Microsoft Brand Space Heater and Fire Starter).<br>  <br>  Beyond that...nVidia tends to be rather backwards about support where drivers are concerned.<br>  <br>  PS: a tip for nVidiaphiles out there...the 7x and 8x generation cards are now called the 250...identical cards in every conceivable way...except the price. The cards called 250s are a couple hundred more than the not re-branded cards.|`|ebuxHnScaa	If the fan spins freely and you didn't overclock the video card, it's probably perfectly normal. Graphics cards get hot.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Make sure the fan is running.<br>  <br>  Graphic cards can become very hot.  Their maximum operating temperatures are higher than those of the CPU.  A CPU might be limited to 60-70 degrees Celsius, whereas a graphics card might have a limit of 105-125 degrees Celsius.<br>  <br>  When the card is in use, it's normal for the fan to make noise.  When you are doing something that puts a load on the video card, such as playing a game with fancy graphics, the card will get hotter and make more noise.  As long as the temperature stays within the limits for the card, no problem.

83967d29b62071929323e508eab23abaaa	Dear its not just concerned about you only. And its not that Its because of Proxy address, because even if you disable the proxy settings, then also you are going to fins the same message at that time.<br>  <br>  Actually RAPIDSHARE reads the outgoing servers details and that generally have a single IP all around the server provider in your community. So, If anyone is downloading from rapidshare in the network provided by the same outgoing server that your INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP) provides then it will show the message "Your IP address is already downloading a file".<br>  <br>  So, There is no problem in your configuration or system, Just You need to wait until his download gets completed every time this message appears.|`|r5o4FjEYaa	Rapidshare track base on your ISP Proxy address.

Obviously you have a problem with authority and it is what led to your being blocked from facebook.  <br>  <br>  If I were your parents, I would move your computer into a public part of the house and would closely monitor everything.  You have shown that you are untrustworthy by your post here and you would have to regain trust before I would ever consider unblocking any site like facebook (which would be very unlikely in the near future)|`|IbxhRebgaa	My first piece of advice, of course, is that you should ask your parents to unblock it. Communication is a much better route to take than underhanded tactics.<br>  <br>  Now for the underhanded tactics:<br>  <br>  It depends on how the blocked it. If they blocked it using URL filtering, simply type in the numerical IP into your web browser and hit <enter><br>  <br>  If they blocked it via an IP blacklist, simply use a proxy or TOR.<br>  <br>  If they blocked it via content filtering (weighted phrases, for instance), use a proxy or TOR.<br>  <br>  If the method through which they blocked it is software, then you could just uninstall the software. Then you wouldn't need to use a proxy or type in any numerical IP addresses. Of course, you'll need an administrative account to undo anything that your parents have done to your machine.<br>  <br>  If, however, they have used your router to block the site, then simply reset the router and assign a new password to it without telling your parents. This will effectively make you the new network administrator. <br>  <br>  Of course, anything other than the first thing I said will lead to conflict between you and your parents. It's not like your parents won't notice what you've done; they will notice immediately and will probably get upset with you. That's why I said it's better to simply talk to them.|`|6OmKjeT9aa	This usually works,<br>  go to google, and type in 'facebook.com' <br>  and then go to it for a different language.<br>  everything should be the same. <br>  if that doesn't make sense;<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip4wQmD0U0E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip4wQmD0U...</a><br>  <br>  that should help.<br>  good luck.|`|aa2131f0b0d93de418b8d02cace49bafaa	No you don't.

Most computer purchasing decisions are the technology equivalent of buying a Corvette, then buying a replacement for it the following week in order to get the new radio.<br>  <br>  Fortunately for people who need a good computer, some of the "replace replace replace" frenzy has subsided to a great degree recently, mainly because computers have been categorized into budgets based on what they are going to be used to accomplish.<br>  <br>  The basic rule of budgeting for a computer purchase is "inexpensive, but good enough." Basic everyday computer use does not require a quad-processor liquid-cooled server with a double-failover power supply and dual SATA terabyte RAID arrays, but by the time the average person gets past all of the jargon and technobabble and grinning salespeople, they find themselves with way too much computer with way too much price tag attached.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basic everyday computer use can be categorized into four things: e-mail, word processing, web and most recently, organization of vacation photos and home movies. The only activity on that list with even the remotest need for an over-powerful system is the home movies part, and that's only if the computer's users plan on editing movies.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, a basic computer will suffice for 99% of what is required by e-mail, web and word processing, so people shopping for computers should consider the following guidelines:|`|oesAfUUGaa	HP a6512p Refurbished Desktop Featuring Intel PD E2200 Processor with 4GB memory and 500GB Hard drive <br>  <br>  this has a lot of memory and i have it i love it it has good graphics in General|`|FteB0LOraa	Buy a Dell.

You can keep running as admin and using "antivirus" and getting infected all you want, but you shouldn't advise others to do it. I'm detailing how you really avoid infection.|`|MGvue1KTaa	If you are not downloading anything, then no. Although if you do a lot of web surfing you have a small chance. It's good to scan once every month, or so, just to make sure.|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	You dont need to scan but you need to update your definitions so you can catch new viruses etc
4MYWPD9Yaa	"The internet" is not something a laptop can come with.<br>  <br>  Most laptops come with a wireless card and a wired ethernet port so they can connect to the internet through a wireless signal from a router or from a wired connection to a router.<br>  <br>  Something else has to provide a connection to the internet (the router's broadcast signal at a coffee shop or the one in your home that you use to broadcast the signal from your internet service provider).<br>  <br>  What your laptop comes with is the ability to use that connection.<br>  <br>  Generally, this is how things work. You pay a company (usually the one who provides you with phone service at home or cable TV) to provide you with an internet connection in the form of a cable modem or DSL modem.<br>  <br>  Then you can use a cord to connect directly from your laptop to that. Or you can use a cord to connect from your wireless router to that.<br>  <br>  Your wireless router then broadcasts a signal that laptops can pick up on and use.<br>  <br>  Your question is sort of like saying "Does my radio come with radio stations?" No, the radio stations broadcast on the airwaves, and if your radio is within range, it can pick up those signals. But if you're in the middle of the desert, you won't be picking up anything.<br>  <br>  So, no the laptop doesn't come with the internet. It comes with the ability to connect to the internet if an internet connection is available.|`|d1d43c8be7b4dd12bd1e7e90583bbe5eaa	Bunch of Morons ... it doesn't "come" with internet ... it may well come with the means of connecting to the internet ... did any of your computers "come" with internet? ... you either already had the internet or had to apply for it separately ... <br>  Depending on your current setup ... it will either plug into your existing modem/router ... or if you have a wireless connection on your modem/router you'll be able to connect through that|`|uV54p794aa	Most new laptops have internet explorer, and many have intro programs for AOL, MSN, Yahoo etc. You'll have to check & see what it is loaded with once you get it. Chances are, you'll have what you need. If not, just go onto internet explorer & type in Yahoo or whatever program you want to use.

Her laptop connects back to my home network via a VPN connection whenever she is online.  I, can connect remotely to her desktop through the VPN connection and see what is on her screen at any time when she is online.  She is also using opendns for her DNS server and I can get a report of every site she has visited.  I can also look through thte logs of her machine to see where she's been.  The VPN logs also tell me what IP address she is connecting from, so I can actually tell where she is when her laptop is connected.<br>  <br>  By the same token, should her laptop ever be stolen and someone manages to know her password, it will "phone home" so to speak, and the authorities could easily trace the IP address back to exactly where the laptop was last connected to the internet, and I could also trigger the web camera to get a picture of the surroundings.<br>  <br>  Has your company installed any such software/backdoors?  I can't say. None of the companies I do IT work for have any such policies in place, and I doubt your's would either, unless you work for a company that handles confidential or proprietary information that they are worried about you sharing.|`|IsUYFV82aa	They can do by some network monitor tools, eg.Ethereal,sniffer,Sax2 NIDS

Restart MSN Messenger.<br>  It would do no harm to also use regsvr32 to re-register: wintrust.dll and initpki.dll<br>  4) Another problem could be firewall related, thus try temporarily disabling the firewall.

Messing in the registry can ruin your OS to the point of having to do a complete OS re-install. So use a Registry cleaner at your own risk!<br>  <br>  Once your registry is clean of all entries related to the program needing to be gotten rid of, you then go into Start>Search and find all files related to that program which are NOT in the registry and delete those manually.<br>  <br>  Then just to make sure your computer is squeaky clean , UPDATE and run your Anti-Malware aresenal. You'll be setting a Restore Point later so you don't want to set a Restore Point where you can re-infest the computer if it has anything on it. That's why it's a good idea to run all you AV and anti-spyware, etc. before and after installing a new prog.<br>  <br>  ONLY THEN will you be able to do a "clean" install of the newer version of your selected program.<br>  <br>  After installation is complete, then run Scan Disk, Defrag and set a Restore point. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

We know about them before you do, and the scripts ensure that they're blocked even before you get a chance to try out that "new" proxy!  (We don't waste our time copying them from Y!A.

bruL6qanaa	You cant back up virtual memory. In simple terms virtual memory is when there is not enough RAM available, so the processor partitions off a section of the local hard disk, and uses that partition as temporary RAM, until there is enough free RAM to run the other applications. The problem with virtual memory is that there is a constant using up, and freeing up space on RAM, and this can be hard for a hard disk to keep up with, thus reducing your computer's speed.<br>  <br>  So, for your second question, just go onto your computer maker's website, and find what kind of motherboard your computer has, then research that motherboard to find out how many RAM ports it has, how much RAM (in GB) it supports (you may also may need to check your operating system specs), and what type of RAM it supports (there are many types like SDRAM,  and DDR2 RAM, to name a few). After you figure this out, you can usually find more RAM on eBay (that's where I got mine). And by the way, laptop RAM is harder to find and install then desktop RAM (unless you are on a mac, which makes it really easy to upgrade your macbook's RAM). The price range is anywhere between $10 and around $50 depending on how much and what type of RAM you buy.

wQhVzHqRaa	There are so many choices for free web sites from basic, intermediate, and advanced (with html/layout editing)...<br>  <br>  You can start easily with the popular free NVU. Then maybe start by signing up with a free host, e.g. Netfirms Basic or the popular 110mb host.  You can also create a web site easily with Weebly, Synthasite, Jimdo, and Webepags. Visit their web sites to review them, and sign in if you want.<br>  <br>  Then perhaps download and use a free template from one of many templates web sites, then upload your site to your free host (use a free FTP program to upload your site - e.g. Core FPT Lite. Then you can optimize for search engines, directories, etc, if you want. <br>  <br>  I use the free host, Netfirms, but their are restrictions, e.g. bandwidth, file upload size, file space size, no direct links to flash sites, etc, but has worked ok for me. Many free hosts require their company name to be added to your URL as a sub domain, (e.g. my site.their sub domain.com) and you may have to add one of their ads (link or banner) to your site. <br>  <br>  You could start with a blog as well, e.g. try the Google’s blogger or the advanced Wordpress (which you can add plugins for enhancement), or use the simple Google Page Creator (soon to be changed to Google Sites - You need a Gmail account) - easy to set up for a beginner. <br>  <br>  There are free (and easy) web site building tools, such as Weebly (Using drag and drop), Snap Pages (Good for sharing photos), and Edicy Pages (Various templates/themes similar to Blogger and Wordpress).<br>  <br>  Later on though, it might pay to learn html/JavaScript/PHP etc, which allows more flexibility to design and modify your web site.

Therefore, stick with the web-safe fonts (which everyone is guaranteed to have):<br>  Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman etc.<br>  <br>  For fonts, you can use names (purple) or Hex values (FFFFFF=white, you can Google for more schemes). I personally prefer hex colors, because there are hundreds of thousands of colors to choose from.<br>  <br>  To center comments etc., it's best to stick with the <center> tag. Even though it's old and isn't used by developers anymore, the new styling requires a lot more code. And besides, center still works.|`|wGjvx0Z9aa	I'm pretty sure bulletins have to have this kind of html used.<br>  <br>  <font face="verdana"> text here </font><br>  <br>  <br>  To change the color, you do this.<br>  <br>  <font color="purple"> text here </font><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As for centering in comments, the only way of doing that would be the <center> tag, and I'm not sure if that still works.<br>  <br>  <br>  <center> text here </center>

These are VERY popular becuase of the graphics quality and small file size for large books, and most laptops can run them anywhere these days.<br>  <br>     The other types are designed for less powerful devices that don't run full versions of Windows, or have large or graphics-capable screens, and they're suually just a text file that has some etra info added to the fle to support fancy characters on the screens or security t only run on their brands of devices, so You'd ahve to have one of their devices that supports those extra info settings.<br>  <br>     Basically it's like getting an MP3 player, in that a music iPod won't run WMA files, or Realmedia files, or hates most simple MP3 files, and most other players won't play a iPod file. But there are still some Mfrs that really dn;t care how the msic is done and make hardware that will run anything.<br>  <br>     Besides hardware, the next option falls to conversion with software from one type to another. If You use this method search for software only from reutable download sites, and THEN use a private website to get a full versin of a software that fts Your needs, most private websites promise theirs will do anything for You then basically You end up getting a virus. They usualll create a million websites offering a program that converts anything from anything and back including the type released at 4:00pm this afternoon for the newest devices. The reputable sites actually test, scan,m and verify their submitted software before you can search for it on their sites.<br>  <br>     If You have a reader device, do a search by brand and model, and You should find at least one page (for sale ads) that will tell You what files it can use, then find a converter software, then start looking for any types the converter supports into Your device's filetype.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                    Good luck!.

If it does, you might get away with it for a while but they will most likely catch on eventually and revoke your activation, and then after 30 days the OS will expire and you won't be able to boot from it. <br>  <br>  I did this before I knew, I had one copy of Vista on both my laptop and my desktop, they both activated fine and worked for a few months, then one day my desktop's activation had been revoked, and I had 30 days to reactivate it with a different key.<br>  <br>  I had to call the automated Microsoft hotline to reset my Windows key, then lucked out that my college gives out a free copy of Vista. <br>  <br>  You can't do what you're trying to do, and really you should need 4 more copies of XP Pro.

If you don't know if your laptop has a built in wireless card you can search on Google for your laptop name and model and find out.<br>  <br>  I would suggest buying a netgear router.  The cheapest one would be fine for the average home user.  If your laptop HAS a wireless card All you need to do is buy the router, come home and power off your cable modem, plug your wirleless router into your cable modem with the cable supplied with the wireless router, power on your cable modem and wait about a minute, then power on your wireless router and wait about a minute.  Turn your computer on and follow the instructions for setting up a wireless connection.  If you need help with that just type in "Setting up wireless connection" into windows help.<br>  <br>  If your laptop does not have a built in wireless card I would suggest buying a netgear wireless adapter.  Just plug it in, let windows find and install the driver, then follow the same instructions mentioned above to set up a wireless connection.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Wireless Router == YES<br>  - I recommend Linksys<br>  PC Card == Maybe<br>  - Depends on age of your laptop.

4MYWPD9Yaa	People are paranoid, because a lot of antimalware programs label some cookies as "tracking cookies."<br>  <br>  Cookies are text files that help websites help you use them. For example, Yahoo! sets a cookie when you log in keeping track of the fact you're logged in. If you delete the Yahoo! cookie, you'll no longer be logged in. If you go to Amazon and add things to your cart, Amazon sets a cookie to your computer keeping track of what items you've looked at and what items you've added to your cart. If you change your Google search preferences to search only in a particular language, Google sets a cookie to your computer to keep track of that. If you delete that cookie, Google will no longer know your preferences.<br>  <br>  Websites can read only the cookies they themselves have set. So Yahoo! cannot read the cookie Google set to your computer. It is not true that cookies contain personal information (like login passwords).<br>  <br>  Websites that contain advertising sometimes have third-party cookies that get set. So if you visit a webpage, you may think you're accessing only that webpage, but ad.doubleclick.net is also setting a cookie to your computer to keep track of what webpages sponsored by DoubleClick that you're visiting and how many ads you've clicked on and which ones. As stated before, in this case, DoubleClick can read only the cookies it has set.<br>  <br>  If you delete cookies, they'll just be set again the next time you visit those sites.<br>  <br>  If you use a decent web browser like Firefox or Opera, you can be prompted every time you visit a website (Allow cookie always, Allow cookie once, Deny cookie always).

You select Properties. You go to the Settings-tab. There you see a slider with the text "Resolution" on top of it. You select the resolution you wish to use and click Apply. You better click Apply instead of OK because if you select an unfitting resolution it will automatically change it back in a few seconds. If everything goes alright, you click OK and you're done.

7rTnvYRMaa	You sound pretty new at this.<br>  <br>  I went to your blog and the adsense ads are up, like the other post said it takes 30 mins to a few hours for the adsense ads to kick in.<br>  <br>  I think you have high expectations for adsense, I think there are a lot of things you need to learn. I would really like to help you, but this box provides so little space. I did a google search on 'pgfgamers' and your blog did not come up. You really should have done some keyword research to come up with a better blog title and blog URL, this would have made it easier to attract more traffic with google.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" rel="nofollow">https://adwords.google.com/select/Keywor...</a><br>  <br>  You need to attract more traffic, that's the name of the game, for every 100 ppl that go to your blog 4 ppl will click on your adsense ads, its a numbers game. Also goggle will give ads that match the content of your site, therefore if your blog is about matchbox cars your adsense clicks will be worth 2 cents each, if your blog is about 24 carat gold designer jewelry, then chances are your adsense clicks will be worth 20 bucks a click. <br>  <br>  Work smarter not harder young jedi!<br>  <br>  To get a rating on Google you need to make as many 'high quality' back links to your site as possible, the main problem with your chosen topic is that it is going to give you cheap adsense ads.<br>  <br>  I did some research for you the keyword [gamers] is valued at $1.62<br>  yet the keyword [gaming] is valued at $4.10 better still the keyword [gaming laptop] is valued at $11.32. This demonstrates how just modifying the keywords you target on your blog can dictate how suceesful your blog will be at making money.<br>  <br>  You want to have a blog  which targets the most expensive keywords that way any clicks will pay more, much more! <br>  <br>  Back to creating backlinks, create an 'Ezine' account and write 3-5 articles about your chosen topic, make the articles keyword rich.<br>  <br>  That's just a start..... you have to make backlinks from a number of sources, I couldn't list them all here cos there is too many.<br>  <br>  Write a few press releases, place links on social networking sites, bookmarking sites, forum posts, squidoo lens, submit your blog to search engine directories, and if thats not enough post regular high quality content to your blog. Do this for six to 12 months and then maybe you can give up your day job.<br>  <br>  That's why the most important thing is to do your research on your chosen niche/topic before you commit yourself cos you could well be flogging a dead horse and end up giving up, and you would have missed the 'motherload' by a few feet and not even realized it.<br>  <br>  Where did I learn all this I hear you ask, lots and lots of late nights or rather early mornings.<br>  <br>  And just to annoy the yahoo page monkeys I used this program<br>  <br>  <a href="http://saljoh.netsalaries.com" rel="nofollow">http://saljoh.netsalaries.com</a><br>  <br>  It has all the information and tools you could ever want!<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, you have to go into adsense and allow blogger to access your adsense account, then you have to create the adsense ads within blogger, sounds a round about way of doing things I know.<br>  <br>  Anyway if you want more info I will only be too happy to offer any resources I have. Here's my blog<br>  <br>  <a href="http://internet-for-marketing.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://internet-for-marketing.blogspot.c...</a>|`|c4f45cb3208d42f175407510ca9d9c07aa	It can take up to 30 minutes for an ad to show up.    if you just created your adsense account though it can take longer as the adsense crawler will have to crawl your site before ads show.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps

8gnp5Kkjaa	Does the laptop have the capability to connect to a wireless network?  Does it have a built-in wireless network card or a PCMCIA card that you have installed?<br>  <br>  If so, then you will need to install the proper drivers so Windows knows how to use the card.  You will either have to download the drivers on another computer, save them to a flash drive or CD, and put them on the laptop that way or you will need to connect the laptop to your Internet router with an ethernet cable if the laptop has a built-in ethernet port, which it probably does.

See if this clears up your problem.<br>  <br>  If not, then try using an ethernet cable or USB cable depending on what the Netgear has as a hard wired connection option, and see if you can get to the internet that way.

IBGoiMKJaa	well when you add pictures or in your album on  the top it might say edit album and them you can tag yourself in your photos you have and that will increase your number on the facebook pictures|`|D3xGtrwwaa	I am not quite sure that I am understanding your question properly... For instance, under my name on Facebook it says "Click here to view pictures of Linds Ward (458)" But that means that I am tagged in 458 pictures. Each of those pictures belong to an album on Facebook whether they are one of my own albums or someone else's. <br>  <br>  The only other way to get your pictures on Facebook is to upload them as a new profile picture. As you add a new one, it will replace the old one but will still remain in your "Profile Pictures" album so that anytime someone clicks on your main picture, any pictures you have previously uploaded as a "Profile Picture" will appear there.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped :)
