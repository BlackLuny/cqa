Ok. so my computer consists of 2 hard drives for storing .. and some other drives      the 2 main ones are:    (C:) Windows.. and (D:) Storage      I keep getting notifications on my desktop that hard drive C has no more room.

20090304124812AAZX9Wn	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Port Forwarding not working?	I wanted to forward ports so a program I have will work faster. I could do everything except the static IP address. Apparently, even though I'm looking at a DIR-615 Dlink router, when I tried the IP's to change the settings it comes up with a lynksis. Then when I set up a static IP address I made it 192.168.0.2 and the internet worked fine.      Then when I tried forwarding the port it only let me change the last number and the first 3 were 192.168.1 so I added a 2 on the end and it didn't work. Then I decided to try to make the static IP 192.168.1.2, but then the internet didn't work.       Theeeennnn, instead of typing in 192.168.1.1 for Lynksis router site I typed in 192.168.0.1 and it suddenly asked me for a password. I can't figure out the password and that says it's a DIR-615.      What  the heck do I do?

20090304125232AAQa3hd	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Should I have two separate Computers for Editing and Gaming?	I getting more into video editing as a professional hobby and have decided to buy a Mac with Final Cut Express.  First, I was wondering if it's better to use a Mac Desktop (Mac Pro) or Mac Laptop (Macbook Pro) for video editing.  I would like to be somewhat mobile so I'm not always stuck in my room...but it's not really an issue.      Also, I'm a pretty hardcore PC gamer and was considering building my own desktop with the best graphics card, memory, hard-drive, etc.  This would mainly be for PC games.      I'm going to cap my budget at $5000.        So would you recommend me using two different systems for editing and gaming?      Or would it be wiser to just choose one system like the Mac Pro Desktop for my editing purposes and soup it up with a decent graphics card and install BootCamp to run windows based games?      I appreciate the input!      Thanks,   ~Michael

This usually doesn't damage anything but it is very annoying.

I decided to download Firefox from the internet, and have been using it as my browser with lots of success. However, I have one question- every time I start up Firefox for the first time after turning on my computer, there's a little pop-up window that appears, showing the Firefox logo and an arrow pointing towards the Applications logo. I assume this means drag and drop Firefox (which has a desktop logo) into the Applications folder, but even though I've done that multiple times, the same window pops up every time I start up my computer and Firefox. And even when I do drag and drop the icon, it still stays on my desktop as well as moving a copy into Applications.   Any suggestions? It's not a big hassle, but I'm wondering why I keep getting the same window when I open Firefox.   Hopefully that wasn't too confusing!

I think my dad has something on one of the doors on the house that detects whether someone opens it or not (it's the back door to the house).   I think this because whenever my mom comes home from work (through the back door), he calls right after she walks in.      So is there such a device that does this? And if so, where does it send the "information"?

Per the properties, it was created, modified, and accessed at 2:38am on Sunday when no one was awake to even use the computer.  How could this possibly have happened?  Nothing showed up on my AVG virus scan - I also updated & ran Spybot Search & Destroy and nothing turned up there either.  I have already deleted the file, and emptied the recycle bin, so I can't obtain more info on it - I'm just wondering how someone could have remotely saved a file like that to my desktop?      We have a Wii that's online as well as an XBox.  We also use a LinkSys router, in case that sheds any light on how this might have happened. ??

20090304140628AAiDqIE	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My HD crashed, and I want to re-install Windows, but there is a twist...?	I purchased my Inspiron 6000 laptop in 2005.  Just about a year ago the hard drive crashed.  I had to buy a new hard drive and replace it with the broken one.  I was extremely busy then and needed a computer ASAP, so I took my dad's Windows XP cd for his desktop and installed it onto my laptop.  Since then, my computer has been running pretty funny.  The battery life is down to about 20-30 minutes, whereas before it crashed I was getting about 1:30 per charge.  Also, I have extremely limited functionality, such as not being able to put my laptop into Standby Mode, Hibernate, or do anything when I close the screen.  The computer gets very hot quickly, and the fan goes into overdrive every 3 minutes or so and is distractingly loud.  Usually when the fan kicks on, the CPU usage goes sky-high and everything slows down.  It can take over 30 seconds to open Internet Explorer and even then the pages don't load quickly (even though I am on Wireless with a good connection).  I have deleted all unneccesary programs and made sure that nothing big was running in the background at start-up.  This appears to make no difference. I have had a couple viruses, but no major ones.  I've beefed up my security and am running clean now.      What I want to do is to install Windows XP for my laptop in hopes that things will start working correctly, but I never got the CD when I bought by computer.  Does this sound right?  Are there different versions for laptops and desktops?  Will this help speed things up?      How can I fix my laptop?      * I realize the poor battery life is probably due to age, but there was a dramatic drop once the HD crashed.

20090304141943AAvePZj	Computers & Internet;Security	I think I have a virus, but I'm not sure?	I use AVG free, every time i go on my computer, it say it has found a tracking cookie, when I click heal, it says that the specified file could not be located.      So I kept just ignoring this, but one day, it cam up and I decided to try and find it myself. Well, I didn't get very far before finding a folder called: Tracing.      In this folder was another folder which was empty and a document called: WindowsLiveMessenger-uccapi-0.uccapilog. This document was a UCCAPILOG file and it was 0kb.      Obviously, with everything in the folder stating it had nothing in, I delted the original folder permanently.      However, the next time i signed into MSN, it appeared again, with the same folder and document.      I have scanned it all with AVG, it says it is clean.      Also, MSN keeps signing not responding after only using it for about 5 minutes, I aslo have the latest version of messenger.      Umm... i think that's it.      Please, I really need to know what's going on.

Say I go      int[] s = new int[2];      Now it will make an array that can hold 2 ints, but right now the values are null right?        So if I go s.length what would be that value?  2 or 0?      OK.  Now say I go:      s[0] = 5;   s[1] = 15;      and I use those values for awhile.  OK but now I want to be done with 15 and I want that space to be null again.  If I go s[1] = null; the compiler throws an error saying:       found:     required: int      OK.  So what do I do?  Can I not delete elements of an array after I've put something in there?

Just purchased a Belken MIMO USB wireless adapter to install on an old HP Pavillion a300n.  (Using a Belkin wireless router) I am confident that all of my settings are correct as I have confirmed with Belkin tech support. The problem I am having is that with shut down of any kind and a restart all I get is the blue and white HP Invent screen.  It will not boot to the windows screen.  The only way I can get it to start properly is to unplug the wireless adapter and then plug it back in and mess around with getting the wireless connection back again.  Belkin swears it is not their product and that it is regarding a setting to be abled or disabled on my HP.  My sister is experiencing the exact same thing with a Belkin wireless adapter.  We are thinking of installing a wireless card instead.  We have heard also that the problem might be with the USB.  Any ideas or comments. I want to get the adapter returned to the store if it isn't going to work.  Please help!

My virus blocker ran out the other day, and being stupid and broke I didn't get it replaced. Today I got sent a link on messenger from a friend and foolishly clicked it. Yes I know I must have had my brains replaced with jelly.      Here is the link DO NOT CLICK for obvious reasons!      ahha is this you??  http://www.hi5-images.org/images.php?==f...       The final email address varies (I ended up being sent). One of my friends is pretty sure she recognises it as a Trojan but can't recall the name. I'm still broke and I think this virus is pretty damn bad. Any ideas on how to get it out of my computer since apparantly it is unspottable?      I've downloaded AVG which doesnt seem to solve the problem, I've tried Stinger in the hopes that its on file (doesn't seem to be). Any solutions bar getting rid of my laptop would be welcome.       Part of the effects include the hjacking of my msn to send the same message to everyone on email list, so some of them are infected. I am in university, and thus don't want to be the responsibility for hundreds of computer crashes
20090304150559AAoijNK	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	My DVD-RW drive keeps opening and closing by itself and I don't know what is causing it?	The DVD-RW drive keeps opening and closing shortly turning on the computer, without me acting in anyway to make it open. I have read about viruses referred to as a coffee holder, although I have norton 360 and it hasn't picked up any viruses. To stop this problem occuring I physically hold the drive whilst its open until it gives up trying to close itself, therefore it will stay open and stop its annoying repitition of opening/closing.       If I insert a cd (whether manually or when already open) and close the drive, it will attempt to read the cd then it will eject itself. The only way I can get the drive to recognise the cd is to open my computer and click on the drive.      What is the problem?      I have a CD-RW which I could change over to see if its a faulty drive, though I don't know what process to follow to do this. Any help appreciated.

Will someone help me to solve this issue? I can see  a big red cross between the icon  featuring my laptop and the icon of the Internet.

If I mentioned the other networks it was to make sure nobody would mistake the fact that the issue was not due to my modem or whatever, but only with my laptop

Of course, it should come with other basic computer necessities (virus protection, USB outlets, Internet haha). Only problem is the price. I'm not rich, so lets keep it under $900, preferably between $200-500.  Don't even know if that's possible. Hey, that's what you're here for =)

20090227081055AA1fLIB	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Why is my computer/laptop so slow when it used to be fast? 10 points!?	I have a Sony Vaio PCG-K45.   Specifications:   Pentium 4 CPU 3.20GHz   2.10GHz, 448 of RAM   Windows XP Home SP3   Display Adapter: ATI Radeon IGP 345M      When the computer was new and up to 2 years old, it was fast. I could run many programs at once.   I even could play a game like Gunbound smoothly.      It got slow after about 3 years. Gunbound runs at like 2fps.      Things I tried already:   I recovered the C drive to factory state.   Took to technition which said I needed more RAM.   Scanned for viruses, malware, and adware.   Scanned registry.   Ended non critical processes.   Defragmented drive.   Set virtual memory to maximum.      What else would cause it to be slow now when it surely use to be fast. Could it be melted parts from keeping it on too long? Fan needs replacement?

20090304150224AAVPqbC	Computers & Internet;Software	Question about Microsoft Outlook 2003 and the sent email databse?	When we send out emails and type the email address manually or get the info directly from the phone book, eventually it builds up an entire database of recently used names and under the "To:" field if we press, for example, the letter B, people we emailed in the past that have a B starting with their name or their email address will show up in a small list and we can select from them. Is there a way we can backup this database? My client wants to get a new computer and wants this database transferred to the new machine, otherwise it's not worth it to get a new machine   He is 65 years old so alternatives are not available (such as sending an email directly from the address book itself). He is used to certain things and wants everything as simple as possible without learning anything new.      Thank you very much

20090304150049AAMnTtq	Computers & Internet;Software	HP/Vista error is becoming a real pain?	I have an HP pavilion laptop with vista, unfortunately.  It worked fine for about a year but now I am getting a stream of inconsistent errors and I have no clue how to fix them.      About half of the time when I start the computer, everything works fine.        Sometimes, it will work fine after start up but within a few minutes of playing video or listening to mp3's, the sound will just quit working.  If I am lucky, when I close whatever i was running, winamp media player etc., turn the volume to zero with the quicktouch button, then turn it back up, the volume will work again.      The alternate to this process is that windows explorer will crash and I will have to restart it.  just like before, sometimes this will bring the sound back, and sometimes it will just continually crash with no progress being made.      Other times, when I start the computer, I get an error message saying "HP quicktouch onscreen display has stopped responding" and there is a red X over the speaker icon on the right side of the task bar.      When this happens, it tells me that I have no driver installed for my speakers and I cant do anything about it.  This is obviously not true as my sound still works some of the time.      Steps I have taken to remedy this situation:      gone into system configuration and disabled HP quicktouch OSD from opening at start up.  Assuming this was the problem, it should have fixed it by simply not opening it.  This has done nothing to help me.      Downloaded and re-installed the sound driver from HP's website.  this did nothing.      My last thought was that through downloading i had let a malicious virus onto my computer that was creating some kind of anarchy in my speakers or drivers so I recently reformatted my system.  It worked fine for about a day, then the errors came back.      I have spent hours trolling forums trying to find a solution to this, and I am completely out of ideas.  If anyone has experienced this or has any suggestions it would be GREATLY appreciated!

I am using PrintMaster Platinum 17 to publish a website for my husband's restaurant.  I have graphics on my computer that I have created for the purposes of designing the website and the printed materials (menus, business cards, etc.) necessary to run the business.  My computer displays them properly on the screen until I publish the pages, and then they come out awful!  They look terrible on the site, and I would love to know of some way to go about fixing it or what I can do to fix this.  Graphics look great on screen as I am editing, but when I preview the project in IE and after publishing to OLSB, it looks atrocious.  Example: www.elpotrilloonline.com    The logo displays the kid of poor quality I am talking about...      I am using PrintMaster Platinum 17 to publish, I used a trial of Paint Shop Pro X2 for photos and logo, and Microsoft Office Live Small Business to host the site, if it is of any importance.  Thanks in advance for your help!

20090304151811AAakVsY	Computers & Internet;Internet;Google	Is MNU, mnuspreadslies.com, and district 9 real?	Ok. So I was just browsing the web a bit and came upon this website: www.mnuspreadslies.com. I was interested, having never heard of MNU and I was wondering what lies it was spreading so I went to the site. It talks about the rights of "non-humans". So I delved a bit deeper and it starts talking about aliens. So I go to MNU's website, to see if mnuspreadslies.com is a sham. Well MNU is what appears to be a legitimate website. If you look at the "careers" section, they are all jobs for interaction between humans and non-humans.       MNUspreadslies.com also talks about an area called "District 9" where a supposed space ship crashed in the desert. I've searched on Google, but the only things I can find are Wikipedia articles.       Does anyone know if this is real or if it's all just a hoax. It seems like a lot of trouble for a hoax, since there are non-human rights rallies and other such things. I would really like to know if anything about these websites is true.       The only thing I can find, besides the absurdity of it all that shows it's not real is on MNUspreadslies.com it shows a letter that MNU supposedly sent to "George" about his website. The letter says that he could be sued for slander and other such things. Slander is spoken untruths. George obviously doesn't TALK about MNU he simply blogs about it, which are written "untruths", which are considered libel not slander. It seems a huge company would know the difference.      Any help?

As a result I guess, I'm not able to connect to the internet. I've switched out cat5 cables and switched out routers, but nothing seems to help. The other machines on the same network are plugged in and working fine.       I'm not exactly sure where to start more troubleshooting to find out what exactly the problem is. A little background info though, I've been experiencing a series of BSoD. I was also having game crash problems, but I replaced the RAM which seemed to stop the errors, but I'm still getting BSoD. I've written down the most recent stop codes, but I can't seem to find any information on them when I google.      My networking problems started yesterday afternoon, but I haven't made any other changes to the system other than new RAM. Today I even did a system restore and nothing changed.       My OS is XP SP3-- if any more info is need, please let me know.      I would greatly appreciate any insight to what the problem could be, or even where I can begin more troubleshooting.

For starters,the only option i have for a display adapter is vgasave which makes everything run really slow, like when i move awindow itll be slow and and choppy. my computer never came with a motherboard disc.  it is a compaq sr2020nx.  when i went to the manufacturers website,i either couldnt seem to find the right drivers or the ones i would find wouldn't work or when i would try to download the graphics driver for my video card i get "setup was unable to find components that can be installed on your current hardware or software configuration..." I think i'm probably  having the same sort of problem with my audio drivers\lan-modem,etc. Another problem (though less important) is when i look at the specs of my c drive it reads thatthe full capacity of it is 130 gb , it normally reads 140 although its a 160gb drive.  somehelp would be appreciated..

I got a new Hanns G HB191D monitor, that I need to run at 1440x900 resolution.

I'm trying to get my profile to have the two columns kind of stacked on top of each other into a single column. I don't really know how else to explain it. I need to find a code to do that, but I can't find anything that actually works. I'm getting frustrated.         I've tried   In the about me section and   in the heroes section.       I've tried:                  And I've tried a ton of other things.       I used to have my Myspace in one column, but when I logged on today it wasn't. I probably erased the code I used on accident and I can't remember what I used before, because it was a while ago.

20090304153504AAgple7	Computers & Internet;Software	Can Someone give me an Excel Formula?	I have an excel document that contains several sheets specific to each account. Columns A (Deposits), C (Interest accrued for the month) & E (disbursements) contain dates while columns B, D, & F contain the amounts for each transaction. Column G contains the running total for each month B+D-F. I need a formula that can disperse the amount of interest accrued for the month between the different accounts/sheets assuming there is money in that account at the end of the month in which the interest was earned. For example I accrued $1,146.00 of interest for the month of January 2009. I need a formula to go in column D that divides the $1,146.00 among the different spreadsheets based on each account's average daily balance on 01/31/2009.      Thanks!
