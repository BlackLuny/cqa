a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	It always has been entertainment to some degree. There will always be political junkies and some folks who get their kicks hearing about death. Some of us can't get enough bad weather and sporting news certainly is nothing but entertainment.  Ever notice a slow news day they seem to invent issues? Even old dead issues become monumental then.  News has to entertain or nobody would bother except those who absolutely have to know all of the individual things they report. Anymore the informative aspect is just icing on the cake..a happy byproduct..|`|KVlRYoidaa	yes,every time i see the president face on TV,it makes me smile.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	It is.|`|E70A7aqcaa	Well, it certainly isn't for any unbiased, truthful conveyance of information, so we  might as well call it something.  God Bless you.|`|xHvuJZaSaa	How you feel is what it is. It's different for everyone. News, (depend) might be a form of entertainment for me and not for you, or Viceversa.|`|77daNNz5aa	News and entertainment are pretty entwined, I'd say. I think there was a point in time (various points, I guess, depends on the mediums around) but gradually entertainment news is making up a great deal of the news we consume. But, in a perfect example, the Daily Show made an excellent point earlier this year. The day after 200+ were killed in Mumbai, many of the major US papers were detailing the Plaxico Burress shooting himself in the leg business....  So because there is this blurring between the two, it is certainly entertainment. I think real news alone is less of entertainment and more about learning, knowledge, awareness, etc. At least that is why I tend to consume news... I may be different from the typical person who watches the local news for the weather, sports, a heartwarming community story and a brief national or world piece.

swiOhDo2aa	This is confirmation that the BBC was right not to show an appeal for funds for Gaza.    There are places - Zimbabwe is one, Palestine is another - where a ruling class will, by fraud or force, embezzle for their own purposes aid meant for the mass of the population. That is why aid agencies have withdrawn from Zimbabwe. It is why it is irresponsible - in fact positively wrong - to send aid into Gaza unless a system can be put in place to ensure that it goes to the people who actually need it, not the rulers.    We now have confirmation, if we needed it, that Hamas is as corrupt and criminal as Mugabe.|`|7zZZEUxqaa	Ok ok, you caught them, so they were hungry and stole some food.

We intrude on it's territory, not the other way around.      As far as the geese and other types of birds are concerned, there is nothing more that can be done at present to keep them away from runways at airports.  We cannot go around eliminating species for our convenience.  All species have a right to exist as they were put here for God's purposes.|`|l4Rbb8Q5aa	An international ocean science organization reported that between 1990 and 2006, there were 8 great white shark fatalities worldwide. One more was added in 2007. That's only 9 fatalities in 17 years. Worldwide, as in the whole planet. Population: 6.75 BILLION.    Heck, an average of 37 human fatalities are reported every year from violent encounters with malfunctioning vending machines!     Wouldn't it be more ecologically responsible to leave the sharks alone and embark on a worldwide manhunt to rid the planet of all those vicious coin-operated carnivores before they wipe out the entire human race if we fail to act?    And geese? What the flock did they do to get your knickers in a twist?    ;)|`|cNVTtkgmaa	No|`|CMJVWGThaa	Lightning kills more than Great Whites by a factor of a hundred.

6JXrlnYsaa	There are two separate procedures going on, stemming from the same group of incidents.    The first is the federal government's legal investigation and prosecution of Blagojevich's alleged criminal acts.  He was arrested and charged with trying to sell Obama's vacant senate seat, attempting to extort bribes from various people and organizations, and other crimes.    He is out of jail on bail.  The US Attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, is still investigating.  Eventually, there will be a criminal trial.  If Blago is convicted, he could go to prison.    The second set of procedures is the impeachment.  According to Illinois law, the state legislature has the authority to impeach a governor for certain offenses.  That's like charging him with crimes, but it's not in the courts.  The offenses are the same as those in the US legal proceedings.  He was impeached.    After that, the Illinois state senate holds a hearing to decide whether he is guilty of those offenses.  They did that, and they found him guilty.  That means that he lost his job as governor.  That's all they can do to him.  The rules of evidence and procedure in the senate hearing are different from a legal trial.    The evidence includes wiretaps of his home phone.  There may be other evidence as well.  The US attorney is interviewing people who may have had private conversations in person with him.|`|cNVTtkgmaa	Did you do as much research on your vote?|`|QvF8dR7Taa	that's why he could be a crook for so long,they all cry the big alligator tears when caught|`|40527ad60966d944ca757e8d6d1c6c28aa	He admitted his guilt when he spoke at the end of his trial.  He asked the politicians to understand his attempt for financial gain in auctioning off Obama's seat... telling them they of all people should understand how expensive it is to be in politics.  He represents a whole bunch of crooks running our lives... I think the question is who's next to be revealed?|`|0PQRC8yraa	You werent missing much.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	the Ill house decide to impeach (accuse) the governor of acting in a manner that was not good for the state.    the Ill senate then voted to remove him from office.    it's not a trial.  no lawyers, and no evidence are involved.  he can say whatever he wants to whomever he wants.  he messed up, and he's out.    at some point, there will probably be a criminal trial.  that's where he can present his defense, and the prosecution can provide evidence.   however, he's pretty much toast in Ill politics.

The true middle class ("bourgeoisie") are the doctors and lawyers and small-scale capitalists.  They won't join the revolution, by and large.  But the working class, who are truly in the middle, might.    In classical Marxism, the proletariat never initiates the revolution and that's why you either need a "vanguard party" like the Sans Cullottes in France or the Bolsheviks in Russia, or a middle-class revolutionary elite, such as the Patriots in the United States or the Criollos in Mexico.    Marx was actually wary of the lowest socio-economic rungs, which he termed the "dangerous" classes. He didn't think the poorest groups would very useful as revolutionaries, and history has generally proven him right.

The Human Rights Act is very specific about the fact that different Articles can't be used in certain circumstances, such as after criminal behaviour.

Personally, I think that prohibition of torture should apply to all humans regardless of what crime has been alleged against them because it is a fundamental human right, and the ECHR agrees.|`|a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	Don't bother to torture them hang them.

(6 times faster than the Nazis!)  in Sudan, it is the muslims from the north attempting to make the "fur people" (hence darfur) convert to islam.  there is a rebel group called the SPLA in sudan which is combatting the muslim sudanese government.    similarities:  both in africa  both genocides  both about difference in race or backgrounds  without international intervention, neither would have had the conflict in the first place (is belgium hadnt colonised rwanda, if china didnt support sudan for oil)  both had/have rebel movements fighting against the oppressors    differences:  sudan concerns religion, while rwanda concerned revenge (taken well out of proportion)  a lot more people died in rwanda  in rwanda, the hutus and tutsis lived in harmony and it is more of a civil genocide, but in sudan they lived more apart so it is like a regional genocide      i hope i helped|`|KVlRYoidaa	two peace loving countries.  darfur is mostly muslim and  rwanda is jewish.|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	Read Barbara Tuchman: The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Te... / http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/us/21g...    This predates the massacre, so to me it stands to reason that having been previously accused of stalking, he probably knew what it was if he did it again... on the other hand, he was mentally ill.     Further information cites that "Gunman in Virginia Tech massacre known to police over past stalking incident" which again indicates that if he had run-ins with the police over stalking, I think it would be safe to assume he knew exactly what he was doing. (http://www.capebretonpost.com/index.cfm?...|`|CCqqTw6paa	stalking women?  what, did i miss something  here?  i thought he went in guns blazing|`|Ss49su1Baa	The gunman prior to the massacre did stalk 2 or 3 women. One of them did call the police but didn't press any charges. Another got a little scared by his " i am a question mark " remark.

AA10307482	The Impeachment of the Governor of Illinois.  Very Positive,  The unqualified Kennedy Brat was talked out of running for Hillary's seat.  Good Job.  My category is the downfall of unqualified candidates.|`|52cGZS3caa	The most positive thing I can think of is the absolutely grand way this country has a change in government administrations.

He maybe behind in brat support but at least the man wasn't eaten by sharks like they were thinking from falling over board when they thought he "dissapeared."    Obama is close to being impeached already, that's also positive.

1G3XPiq3aa	I'd still have a job. You know the difference between right and wrong. Don't say things you know you shouldn't. If it's not considered politically correct, there's a reason it's not. What's the point in saying stupid things if you know better? You don't gain anything from making these comments.     But I have yet to hear of someone being fired for a politically incorrect remark made in private outside of the work place, so I'm not sure why this is in Current Events.|`|jTQSSGAbaa	no i havent as you say no one would have a job would they i dont know about you but i am sick of pussyfooting around everyone|`|QNA6eKsvaa	UR A WIMP/Y|`|5AwLW1buaa	You are right. All these mistakes and comments are blown totally out of proportion. The world needs to get with it - and realise that offensive remarks will never be stopped, and more often than not, they are not MEANT to offend.

I am pleased that they sacked her anyway - her attitude annoyed me, and I believe she was only employed because of her mother.  The real problem is that she has refused to apologise.|`|64SObnr5aa	I was told, by people at the place I worked, that I would likely lose my job if I kept up what I was saying.    I was in total disagreement with getting into our wars.    I really feared for my job, so much so that I kept my mouth shut.    I worked for the "liberal" San Francisco Chronicle at the time.  They had become a mouthpiece for the NY Times who admitted after the fact that they were nothing more then a mouthpiece for the Bush White House and didn't do their homework and willfully buried the opposition.    I have since been vindicated.    Peace  Jim    .|`|hpzfccwaaa	And for those who have never kissed up to the ring of politically correct . Do you suppose that be the reason for their years of unemployability. Of course i do not want to be wandering on the question because i would simply be abusing my mind with non essential fact searching and thus waste my valuable remaining time here on earth.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	That's true. I think the Carol Thatch' fiasco is different, since it's not really her income generator and she is on the telly so should know better. I didn't or wouldn't have sacked her, but I didn't agree with her comment at all.    She should have apologised.|`|VfYvJypEaa	It would be zero  employment .|`|TRgc8Wvwaa	yes, and half the time you don't realise you're doing it, and nobody notices either. it's just the few that pick up on it and turn it into a big deal.|`|EEpBrsSnaa	There would be no one in work.

I refuse to let some bureaucrat tell me what I can and can't say in my own country.|`|E9yH3tWMaa	While I sympathise with Carol Thatcher, I do think she behaved rather recklessly. The BBC is one of the most PC organisations in England and to make such a comment within earshot of Jo Brand does show bad judgement.    Why we should pander to the ultra sensitive on matters of race while permitting many other forms of name calling is a question that denies rational answer.|`|AA12349988	Every one who made a racist remark at work to a co worker should lose their job.    This was not a comment to a friend in the home or down the pub but a remark at her place of work  -  whilst she was being paid for by members of the public - many of whom have been personally called or described as a golliwog.    There is no excuse - she was sacked and rightly so,    I wonder what the reaction would have been if it was Robert Mugabe sons making racist comments about the white British people while being paid by the BBC......   I am sure that you and others  would be demanding blood not just a sacking|`|AMFajJCgaa	I would say around 98%|`|MLLCn4weaa	Very high unfortunately.    Many, many people think it's acceptable to make overtly racist comments in the workplace, when really it just displays ignorance.  I'm glad the BBC sacked that idiotic woman.    Edit: Well said Hal - you're always so much more explainatory than me!! x
vl0HWTDJaa	I don't know really I guess it must just be a sort of jealousy because if the had cancer the general public probably wouldn't care or pay them money to talk about it. I think it's understandable though, she's already in a terrible situation, the last thing she needs is to be worrying about not being able to pay the bills as well.    And she is spending as much time as she can with her boys. It is possible for them to be in the room at the same time as a reporter or photographer. But at the same time, they are very young and she's trying to protect them from her illness by letting them stay with other people while she feels worst so it doesn't affect them too badly.|`|8897ef26cacbd959d0b80f92cb194984aa	Sorry, technically we are not dying from birth.  Cells may die to be replaced by new cells, but you as a sentient being are not.  I have no issue with Jade making money, I take issue with her making money off the back of her illness, and trying to disguise it as awareness.  If she really wanted to make people aware and raise money for cancer research, she wouldn't be pocketing the cash.  Save the BS argument about her kids, before her illness she was worth 3 million quid, healthcare is free in the UK.  Those kids won't benefit from the money, because her crackhead mother and junkie boyfriend will spend it all long before those kids benefit.    No, sorry, it's not true, it's some hair brained theory, that some half wit has told you.  "The death clock is ticking" and how does this mean we are dying as soon as we are born?  Your body does not start dying from birth, but yes we do have a life cycle, and from birth we are moving towards that inevitable end and how long your life lasts is dependent on many factors. But again you are not dying from birth. And it has nothing to do with being morbid.    Lol, no you are obviously another brain dead who can't comprehend two separate ideas.  I am not dying, skin cells may be dying, lung cells may be dying but they are being replaced, as a whole I am not dying, But I am still heading towards the end of my life cycle.  Meaning one day I may be dying and one day I will die, but I'm not dying now. Try telling a healthy active 65 year old that he is dying, when there is nothing wrong with him.  People are dying when a major organ or whole body is facing catastrophic failure, ie, cancer, brain tumor, lukemia, and an assortment of other terminal illnesses,this is not the case at birth. Wake up and engage your brain!    Think about what your saying, I mean, by this "we're dying from birth" rational, why have medicine, why have doctors, who gives a hoot, we're all dying anyway.    Yeah, Knots of frustration, that in the 21st century, with a first world education system, unimaginable amounts of information at our fingertips, people still think that a new born baby, who is growing, is generating cells, synaptic nurons, re-generating white blood cells, fighting sickness, strengthening an immune system, etc.etc. is "technically dying".  It's shocking!|`|wnyuH0aTaa	Who is Jade Goody?    Is she that git with the big mouth?|`|UmIRYF6Jaa	It's life and possibly jealousy.|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	Because her clock seems to be running out of time early and she's spending more of her limited remaining time with the media than with her family.|`|MlQeaP1caa	I dunno about the rest of it but I've been browsing some of the youtube comments out there on jade. I think a lot of people dont have any concept of life / death - pretty sick society really. Its all jealousy, its quite sad to read insults directed towards someome whos dying, ffs have a bit of decorum and respect ppl|`|dK0nBUQraa	It is not big and it is not clever, but they think it is.|`|o3Uq6irbaa	Elliot you are a clown your whole statement is one big contradiction. You even admit we are if you actually read what you are writing. Take your head out of your backside it will help.|`|S8RL9lieaa	She has her face splattered across newspapers every day and that lays her open to criticism. Most people choose to suffer in silence not to make a song and dance out of a situation we all know only to well.|`|EEpBrsSnaa	Good on her for making some cash out of it, I aint knocking her for that. BUT she needs to sort her prorities out now.  Enoughs enough, spend some time with your boys Jade!    News reports suggest the boys are with their dad.|`|61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	Hi.well i do not knock her & hope the new medications helps her.
AoJKQRNXaa	this is where we will disagree Dutches.  Parents know whats best for their children not the other way around, she is doing exactly what i would do if i were in her unfortunate position, any real Parent would.  A friend of mine died from this horrible disease, and when he begun to waste away he stopped his loved ones from seeing him in that condition, to spare them the extra pain, was he right or wrong for doing this? I was with him in his last days and I am as hard as they come, it broke me but it had to be done, it took a dieing man to show me what a real man was.    Edit   dutches i understand what you are saying , but she is providing for her children before she dies, how any one can say that is wrong i do not nor do I want to understand, and I do not think that her children buy or read the tabloids , cheers.    Edit,  Dutches I know you have not knocked her for providing for her children.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i can understand what your saying, i should imagine making cash is done while the boys are at school.. my friends husband died when her daughter was 8, her husband died of renal failure it was a slow and painfull death . her daughter found it very difficult to cope watching her dad die and would beg not to go to see him in hospital, for 6 months this little girl practically lived at my house, this girl is 18 now and has very painful memories watching her dad suffer. from my experience as much as i love my kids i think id want their dad to become more and more involved to make things much easier when the time comes|`|TRgc8Wvwaa	It depends on the childs age. And how close you are. obviously young children would be quite close. She (jade goody) is in the papers a lot etc. but how many hours a day does that actually take up? we can read the stories all day long, but that doesn't mean she's not sat at home with her kids while we're reading them. For all I know, she could be spending lots of time with her kids?|`|aOjMf5SPaa	I want her to make a bucket list - lets make all her dreams come true and experience the life she's got left.|`|3TsO2UWRaa	Well i'd feel guilty if i did the first option, and it will add more pain to remember your mother...    Hard choice =P  but i'd go with the 2nd one  im just not like that    wait do you mean get life insurance for your mom ??|`|AA10950898	She's dying, so she should spend the time the way she wants. The child will still haven't memories, wouldn't she/he?|`|GfphOIdOaa	i would want her to stop dying.  if that's not an option, I would want to spend as much time as possible with her.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	both.  If you grew up in poverty, you'd do both too.|`|0pX1oQAJaa	memories. why have her go out and make money until she died, just to leave you with money, than no memories of her?|`|LzeB46RLaa	keep the child with her chest full time each moment till her death and try to talk with the child any thing as if the child do not understand anything but he can recollect some portion / moment of this memories of his / her mother when he grows up.|`|i2wbADHbaa	Children will want their mum.     I think a lot of Jade's need to earn money is because she doesnt want her kids to have the same upbringing as her. She missed a lot of her education to look after her mother after a motorbike accident and they were short of money.    I don't think she is doing it to be selfish|`|qDLT1eh6aa	My mum did die, my sister was 11 so still a child, I was older, but it was still hard.  I'd want her to stay with me. I'd want her to literally hug me 24/7, although its not practical.

I read yesterday I think that her boys are staying with their dad at the moment, but that could be part of the usual custody agreement or because of her treatment, it's hard to say. I don't blame her for trying to make as much money as she can to give her children some security, I'm sure she does still spend plenty of time with them.|`|FO1XCZc4aa	I think most kids would opt for their mum to mum - close by and there always :|`|S8RL9lieaa	Money can't buy happiness.

Those boys are at risk of growing  up not knowing her but seeing her all over the internet and the press and wondering why the hell she wasnt with them in her last few months.    see what I'm saying?

She's not on her death bed quite yet.  But I'm sure Heat will be there to capture that moment too.|`|i2wbADHbaa	I don't think kids should ever be lied to about the graveness of a situation. I know that jade goody has kept a lot of her illness from her boys because they are so young, but kids are a lot more resilient than we give them credit for.    Either way I think a parent knows best for their child and I am not one to judge how people chose to do things.      I just find it heartbreaking when young kids are left without a parent because of this horrible disease|`|q4tTabfjaa	Shady, People who are ill are called "patients" and if it is relevant to be with the person it is irrelevant if they are ill or not.

There's a fine line and it's up to the parent to decide what is best for their child. We know what the media shows us but we don't know everything that goes on behind closed doors so I think it's best not to judge.|`|AA11587891	Not everything in life can be happy all the time and its necessary for some people to witness suffering and death in their family - its part of human life.

4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	I am disgusted with her behaviour.  If she's desperate for publicity she should do something constructive like try and raise money for cancer research or cervical cancer awareness.  Patrick Swayze is an inspiration, he has admitted he is ill but is staying away with dignity.  It must be awful for her and her family but, I'm getting sick of reading about it!|`|LV9l8EFkaa	nope, I fell bad for her that shes dying but why does she think we would want to know everything, makes me hate her even more|`|AA12279950	Personally, no I wouldn't but you have to put things into context. Consider the girl's background - her father, was a drug addict and habitual criminal, who served prison sentences including a four-year term for robbery. He died of a drugs overdose. Her mother was never there for her and is a recovering addict with many health problems of her own. Jade wasn't well educated and isn't the brightest button on the jacket. Yet she found a way to make a very good living for herself and her family (credit, I'm sure, to Max Clifford). I've never been her biggest fan but she's made the very best of a sh*t life and I certainly don't blame her in any way for wanting to do the best for her boys.|`|aIZfiU6Kaa	I would do ANYTHING to leave my children a secure future, whatever the cost to my own dignity.    It takes very little of her time to have the occasional photograph taken and to keep interested parties up to date on her progress.    I think it's a very unchristian attitude for those who judge her badly.|`|ULgGWDnWaa	oh stop giving out  about the poor woman!as you said she is dieing. if this is the way she wants to do it so be it! obviously people want to know about it or you wouldn't hear about it! If you don't want to know about it then don't listen to it! who are you to give out about the way someone wants to live the end of there life. its not very dignified to give out about a dying person is it?|`|joCmpG63aa	Jade has said she is doing this for her kids future.  I don't think it's right to judge her in the situation.  At least she is raising awareness.|`|i2wbADHbaa	She is naive and gullible and young for her age.      She thinks by doing this she is making sure her sons never go without if she does die. She is famous for being famous, the other people you have named are famous for being actors and TV presenters.|`|ifUIxyauaa	No I'd get a tommy gun and go on the rampage in Afghanistan|`|hviykDAraa	No - i find this really bizarre!   I understand that she is in the public eye and it would be very hard to keep it private but that doesn't explain why she is in every magazine with her story. I really feel for her as she has two young kids but how many other people have cancer with children and they are not in the papers and magazines all the time!!|`|dxlNwGuWaa	I can kind of understand wanting to make as much money for her kids before she dies-i mean she is unlikely to be well enough to work again is she?  BUT in the same respect, going to the media is a double edged sword.  On the positive side, she is bringing cervical cancer into the limelight, and, as most people will hear her story, it might encourage some women to go get a smear done-my best friend took some convincing-everyone just assumes it is an old ladies cancer, but since Jades diagnosis, countless young women have come forward with their stories, campaigning to get the screening age lowered back down to 20.    On the negative side, her young chilfren are going to be exposed to all this, which isnt fair on them.  They probably arent old enough to understand what is happening, and seeing their mum plastered over newspapers, tvs etc, with the dreaded 'C' word, is probably really distressing for them.    I think now she has said her piece, she should concentrate on spending time with her children.    She has always been famous for the wrong reasons.|`|fCgfReMiaa	No i do not believe that she is fame hungry and selling her soul. Any money she has made from this will go to her two young boys, shes trying to secure their future for when shes gone. i think she is very brave and dealing with it the best she can also i think the publicity is good because it helps other women become more aware of cancer especially at a young age. She is only a year older than me. i find it frightening and terribly sad. I wish her all the best and really hope she pulls through somehow. God be with her and her boys.|`|mDkUmEUzaa	Perhaps due to the bad press etc and also the fact that she lost a lot of money and was verging on bankruptcy - maybe she is doing it for the money so her boys can have a better life.    I have never been a Jade Goody fan but I admire what she is doing now.  She obviously loves her family very much and perhaps people should lay off her a bit now|`|d7bf572dbd1b69fb93ce34ee4b827357aa	I'd just want to spent my time with friends and family.|`|mobG2SVZaa	if i thought they'd pay me lots of money then yes i would want the same as all parents to be able to provide for my children even after my death    is it any worse what she is doing than what all the small minded people are doing by constantly slagging her down ive never been a fan of hers but i can see no wrong in wanting to provide for your children.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	yes why not the money will provide for her children., have you any idea what it must be like knowing your not going to be there to bring your children up, who are you to judge      edit    ive answered your question i would do anything i could while i was still able for my children, dont you think its a good thing that the media is taking up this story as it just might save some lifes.as you say die with dignity im sure jade will when the time comes, you question like many others is suggestive and quite honestly vile|`|3VJvfjbIaa	I never liked Big Brother i like to know why she makes the tv/papers all the time because intruth she's just like all of us, my grandad had cancer and died via it and he wouldnt of gone to the papers and broadcasted it!    i think Big Brother is a stupid show and acting personally like an idiot for a month or two and then your so called famous at the end!      mind you in 1 way i hope she gets better soon but in truth shes like the lot of us!|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	Haven't you ever seen it the other way round - the media hound her because it sells newspapers and magazines.  Of course she is not going to say no because she needs the money for her boys.  Nobody said bad things about Kylie who was in the paper constantly or Patric Swayze.  People like you who say bad things about her will get it paid back.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	She has answered that question herself & her answer is she is doing it to make as much money as possible for her kids future.  She grew up with little money & is trying to give her kids a good future.|`|4UQegWk0aa	No, she doesn't know the meaning of the word dignity.    She only knows the words "fame whore" and "media hungry".|`|ea1ed505e3c0a89111a6fcd5e18dd1a8aa	I try not to criticise dying people. Sounds like bad karma to me.

You are all slamming Israel and I'm just telling it like it is. Israel is heavy handed and the fundamentalists in Palestine are suicide happy. How is any of that different to what anyone else has said? Learn to read English. Bunch of idiots. Neg someone for being rude or talking BS, not for stating facts.|`|ufItSQsZaa	Israel want to isolate the Hamas leadership in Gaza because they do not wish to collaborate with Israel (!) :  Israel seeks to isolate Hamas in cease-fire talks with Europe  By Barak Ravid    Israel would like to see a diplomatic agreement bring the military operation in the Gaza Strip to an end - so long as the deal excludes Hamas, according to a decision made Sunday by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his Foreign and Defense ministers, Tzipi Livni and Ehud Barak.     Israeli leadership will convey that message to visiting European statesmen Monday, stressing that an agreement on the Gaza Strip should include both regional and international components.     Olmert is scheduled to meet today with visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Livni will meet with a troika of foreign ministers from the European Union.     In addition to the foreign ministers of Sweden, France and the Czech Republic, which currently holds the rotating presidency, two senior officials charged with EU foreign policy, Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner will also attend the meeting.     Israel's diplomatic strategy is based on a conclusion that it will not seek a new cease-fire agreement with Hamas through the services of an external mediator, which decision makers believe only legitimizes the radical Islamist organization.     "Hamas has already proved that it is not a partner [for peace] when it violated the cease-fire," a senior political source said Sunday in Jerusalem.     Israel will instead seek separate agreements with moderate Arab states, with the Palestinian Authority and with the international community.     "The international community will initiate the agreements and will impose it on Hamas," the same source said. "The agreements will be with both the PA and Egypt and then if Hamas will not agree it will pay the price, mostly by even greater [diplomatic] isolation."     Israel is seeking three agreements:     *On smuggling, a deal with Egypt, with American involvement, which already exists in the form of combat engineers working to uncover tunnels.     *On the crossings, Israel would like to bolster a 2005 agreement with the PA, Egypt, and the EU, that will restore use of the Rafah crossing and deployment of PA and EU officials that will oversee its operation.     *On a cease-fire, Israel would like to involve the U.S., France and moderate Arab countries, in a Security Council agreement that will grant Israel the right to respond to Hamas violations.     Olmert told Sarkozy during a telephone conversation Sunday that, "the government has not authorized any steps to date that include the reoccupation of the Gaza Strip."     The Prime Minister stressed that Israel is differentiating between, "terrorists and innocent civilians living in the Strip" and reiterated that Israel is "doing a great deal to assist the population by allowing the transfer of humanitarian supplies."|`|cCQlcIntaa	To prove that the common man,s view about jews is correct,|`|HTwnjVo9aa	Give them a rope long enough....

i2wbADHbaa	I think there is some good come of it.  Jade is famous for being famous and like it or not there are plenty of young girls who look up to her for this.  They follow her every word in each gossip magazine and are learning how ignoring smear tests and follow up treatments can leave you having cancer throughout your body.      Not every person who has cancer raises money for Cancer Research or indeed any charity, not everybody is going to do that.  It's her choice and yes it can be called selfish.    Cervical cancer and breast cancer is very rare in pre menopausal women, reading in gossip magazines about Kylie or Jade's illnesses with prompt a lot of young women to have smear tests or do a breast examination.|`|qBGcU465aa	I would have thought that the the publicity this unfortunate mothers sickness has raised covers all you have proposed.  if she can make money while  doing so it is not to Cancer research she should be giving it to, as a mother she is doing the right thing , providing for her children, there are a lot of so called mothers in here who could learn from that|`|zZ6wjO6Maa	Hang on a minute - her mistakes??  She went to the doctors a long time ago but they didn't pick it up - she was actually tested for ovarian caner in 2004 (also bowel cancer in 2006) but was given the all clear so she didn't actually make mistakes by not getting tested!    And most cancer tests are for older women (apart from the smear tests) so younger women have no chance as far as those particular tests - yes you can test yourself with breast and testicular cancer for men but others such as ovarian you can't do that.    Yeah i just read that - i apologise. But if she kept getting abnormal cells she probably got fed up and thought she would bury her head in the sand - doesn't mean she is a bad person - just that she made a mistake and she is well and truly paying for it now isn't she?|`|xcdHd7G0aa	Personally I think she should conserve her energy and put it towards fighting the cancer and spending time with her children rather than go off campaigning. I think her being so public about this will have done some good as it is. She has been open about her mistakes and I'm sure that a lot of young women will learn from that.|`|oUFDy2Koaa	Well what has happened to her made me go have a smear test this morning so you could argue that depending in the results, she could have saved my life. You never know.    The fact that she is so young has opened up a lot of eyes. I haven't had a smear test in ten years which is probably one of the dumbest things I have ever done - but hearing about Jade made me wake up and get my butt to the doctors - I might not have done before - I'm young and I hate smear tests and now I know how stupid I have been.    She's spending her time fighting cancer and being a mum - just because she is famous does not mean she owes anyone anything, you know.|`|kXwYz5EKaa	i would prefer if it was someone more "reputable" (please excuse the phrase), because its jade goody for many people it looks more like she's trying to stay in the public eye rather that raise cancer awareness|`|08ac3ef6018bc4ead2fd5466972287b5aa	yes , her death ..anyone who uses there cancer for publicity (for herself not some charity) is a lost cause.|`|5AwLW1buaa	You could ask so many things of Jade at this time. But all I knows is, if I had this news, I wouldn't be thinking straight. There is plenty she should and shouldn't do - but will she be strong enough to make wise decisions at this time in her life?|`|uKrdjrJiaa	You really do seem to hate this girl dont you?What concern is it of yours if she tries to make the best of a terrible situation.Also to quote you 'i would look up more links about her story if i could be bothered'.For someone who is no bothered you seem to be extremely interested in what she is doing?No one forces you to watch or read anything about her but can you imagine if that poor girl read some of the spite that has been written on these pages.Edit-surely by the way you are asking these questions you r complaining about the fact she is spending so much time in the public eye?.If the picures of her yesterday are not publicity enough about the dangers of skipping tests i dont know what is.You cannot say she is hiding away-on the contrary i think she is doing a good job highlighting the dangers of cancer just by allowing the public to see what is happening to her.Out of interest what more would you suggest she does?|`|FO1XCZc4aa	No Skidoo. She really wants to use her time fighting the cancer and still being a mum to her boys. Her position in the media spotlight means she will be indirectly raising awareness and supporting the cause.   I think her boys would prefer her to be local and have used every ounce of her to fight the cancer than running around raising awareness for same cause|`|nW3iJkT5aa	Max Clifford is doing very nicely|`|EEpBrsSnaa	Yes. That is exactly what I have been saying.  She could use her obsession for publicity for the greater good whilst still making money|`|vl0HWTDJaa	I don't think she should feel obligated to do anything when she's running out of time to spend with her family.

There reasons to sack her  are hypocritical garbage when you think about the Ross affair a planned act to offend on air. Its also sad that royals are going to stop selling golly wogs caving in to the PC lobby i think we should do the opposites to defend freedom and common sense.

The picture showed him with his hair all awry and yes I think I would have made the harmless remark that he looked like a golliwog.  A golliwog is a soft doll with fuzzy hair made from rags.  I have nothing against Andy Murray nor am I racist but I am older and a golliwog is still within my vocabulary.  I suspect that a lot of younger people will hardly have come across the word.    I see you are a Commander in an Infantry Battalion, may I support you for the tough job you do in various parts of the world, and as a Commander I am sure you will have heard many words used in circumstances where perhaps they should not be used however it does not give anyone the right to police these words.

LgKYrup2aa	What you don't seem to understand is that if they can torture one  -  they can torture everyone.     If they can break one law themselves - they can and will break others.    Do you think laws should only apply to people outside the government and the Police.?    Are you happy that they ignore their own laws?    I suggest you think it through to its logical conclusion.
Klp0Mv6kaa	Its very simple.Europeans support Israel,because:  1.Israelis do not urinate in European churches when they are in Europe on busines or as tourists.  2.Israelis do not rape European women and do not call them "Christian sluts".  3.Israelis do not burn cars ,smash windows,and attack the people in the streets of the European cities even if the Europeans cast a film Israelis do not like or make cartoons on Moses.  4.Israelis do not threaten to convert all Europeans to Islam(pardon ,to Judaism) - or kill them if they refuse.  5.The most important.Israelis DO NOT KILLL EUROPEANS AND DO NOT PERPETRATE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THEM,like your muslim"brothers" do.  All is clear?|`|S8RL9lieaa	We like Israeli's and people who can spell.|`|RRTDRSw1aa	Europeans mostly not still support Israel.

If you say the leader of a group is know by facts to be a terrorist and those who willingly follow are as the same leader acting on the leaders orders the suspected terrorist must be given the opportunity to retreat from following the leader and be in protective custody until the leader is apprehended and detained for further sanity testing.

Let them be sold in the shops if people want to buy them - trade is trade. What does offend me is the patronizing whites holding up their hands in horror to prove how unprejudiced they are.  B*llox!  They are just using this as an excuse to have a crack at a woman they don't really like.    Many whites still have a crack about colour - my family have been here 80 years - I give as good as I get.  The only ones deeply offended are Blacks with deep seated psychological hang ups, trying to score points and get a moral edge, and very low self esteem; and weirdo whites with something to prove.|`|UmIRYF6Jaa	No, they were popular soft toys till people started to take offence at nothing.  There was one in the noddy stories and a sticker of one on every jar of Robertson's jam which you collected so many to get a free enamel badge with loads of different ones to collect i.e. playing musical instruments or sports.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	I'll buck the trend and say they are offencive in my opinion. The name golliwog was meant to be offencive in the British Army in the 19th century. I'm not black either. Many black people may not care one way or another, but some may still find it offencive. It is unnecessary to have to refer to that name. It serves no purpose other than to insult.|`|aGcRB3pyaa	I do not personally believe they are offensive in any way shape or form.  Political correctness is making a shambles out of common sense.
8b6drjYIaa	Q1. yes  Q2. 16, because 14 is too young, and I think there should be requirements for voting in high school (at 16) such as, you must attend a high school, have a high-ish GPA, take a politics class.    The problem with lowering it would be that many people just vote the same as their parents, you would want them to have their own opinion.|`|5AwLW1buaa	It wouldn't make a difference, pal.    Notice the huge percentage of indifferent voters at each election. Is a 14 year-old really gonna be into voting, or asking questions about Miley Cyrus?|`|dK0nBUQraa	From what I have seen on here, it should be raised to at least 50.|`|bIxZiOaxaa	Q1. it probably depends on a lot of things, like what's the age of consent, what age depending on which country you are from can you drink alcohol and enter pubs and clubs, what age can you attain a driving or gun licence. It could relate to a number of things as to whether or not the voting age should be lowered, what do i think, probably not...  Q2. i think 18 is a good age.    2 reasons why it shouldn't be lowered - 1. i think at the ages of 14-16 politics should be taught more in schools and 2. honestly it's to young...    i think you can increase the young people in politics if it is taught in schools and taught well, compulsory at some point, then we can make sure that our young people have some background and some idea about what the hell is going on...    unfortunately the next generation will always have those problems to deal with, there are too many factors at play...can it really be solved...what about the NIA a legal term that means intervening, what are the intervening factors that changed its course...what happens if we had a world wide viral pandemic killing off most of the worlds population, right there is the unpaid debt, what happens if a lethal viral infection only affected adults between the ages of 25-35 another lot of mortgages unpaid, car loans, education fees not finalised. maybe it wont happen but other N.A.I's are out there...check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_th... ...i know its about negligence but the principles are the same...    talking about adults not being mature or knowledgeable enough really comes back to the classroom in regards to politics i mean, it could solve the problems of the next generation of adults if they have a solid background in politics...do people have the right to not give a damn absolutely we see it all the time and thats the way it is, you can't force people...    do we need to put more stress on teenagers...they should focus on being the best they possibly can...and not worry about pressures of compulsory voting they've got enough on their plate.     Kind regards|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	yes i think it should be 16 , it will get younger people interested and understanding politics after all it is there future|`|EEpBrsSnaa	You make some good points, my initial reaction on reading the first question was 'no'  To lower it to 16 could be a good idea, teenagers could start to take some responsibility for their own world.  Theres many young people that are members of a political party even though they aint old enough to vote.|`|8897ef26cacbd959d0b80f92cb194984aa	No, we have enough unrealistic idealist adults voting already, start letting children vote, we will heaps worse off.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	And then 13, 12 ,11 and before very long, 3 year old's are standing at the voting booth, deciding between ice cream and chocolates.  And the 'uncle with the nicest smile.  According to most psychiatrist and learned folks, people mature around about 27 years of age. That is the age your brain will stay at for the rest of your life. (experience).  Whether married, with kids or without. Read all the 'Election' trifle being written about Obama, and the poor man hasn't even started working.  Peace.|`|AA12292803	i think the voting age should be at least 30 ,lets face it most peoples brains are up their @sses (including me)until they reach 30 ,thats when people start to actually think ,|`|xDPQ700baa	Good god no. I do not want fickle hormones deciding my future.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	I very much doubt any teenagers would be interested in voting.  Most adults aren't even interested.|`|ej9oM98paa	Absolutely not.  If anything it should be raised to age 21.  It's understandable that some teens are current with politics and world situations, but this is a small percentage.  I do agree that teens know about issues that they face.  This should be handled locally (and is).|`|AA11893861	NO    any younger and they are considered minors . Plus the kids don't have a clue what they really want at that age . I don't care what IQ you put after their name . they are still kids . If they lower the voting age , then maybe they should lower the age that they can go to war . That is why the age was lowered in the 70's , The phrase was old enough tho go to war , but too young to vote .  So , NO ! is my answer
