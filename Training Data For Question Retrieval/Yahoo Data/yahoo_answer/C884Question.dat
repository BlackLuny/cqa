My wife and I are looking to buy our first home..especially with this new tax credit this yr...she is a teacher and I am in banking..our combined salaries are $120k...only problem is we have ALOT of debt...roughly $3800 a month for credit cards, cars, and student loans...our credit scores are over 700, but im afraid the debt to income ratio being too high will be a big issue..we do pay $1100 a month in rent (not aprt of the $3800/mo debt)..so i dont know why we would be turned down for a mortgage of $160k..but im just wondering if anyone else has been in this situation, if they were approved, or if there are any special offers we could take advantage of...

On Saturday my car caught fire while I was driving it (apparently the fuel line came out). It's a Peugeot 206 1999 and has done 87,000 miles. It wasn't in bad condition either. It's blatently a write-off, the engine looks like one big bit of plastic. My question basically is 1) how long do insurance companies usually take to pay out on this kind of thing, and 2) what will I get? I've looked on parkers and stuff, but you have to pay to find out... so I thought I'd see if any of you lovely people know first! :)

How do you treat CAPITAL contribution made after a business has already started...      I mean say the owner (sole trader) continues to inject or deposit into the biz account his own    Funds (ie  money from other sources or funds that have already been taxed).      Now I know from a COMPANY perspective (not sole trader) if a shareholder or    director of a private company continues to take out money from company account,    say ATM, Credit Card etc, a Directors Debit Loan account is established......   (appears as an asset in the company balance sheet)      However come year end in some cases, we do a journal entry where we DEBIT    dividend and CREDIT Loan account to reduce it, then that dividend is assessable    in the directors (or shareholders ) personal tax return.....(unless its a loan    account re div 7A issues )      Now back to the sole traders situation.....      As I mentioned he continues to put money into the bank account, and for which I    should record it in MYOB as Capital....(Debit bank -deposit and credit Capital)      However when he takes money out of the Account thru the year  How should i    treat it?      Do I debit drawings and credit bank or debit capital and credit ??????        In other words, overall im trying to sort out this sole traders tax returns for    the last 4 years...      Hes continually contributed funds into the bank account (business) and I want    to somehow reflect that in the tax return......      Can you shed some light, i have totally gone blank as to how to deal with    this....      Anyway I hope to hear from you or at least get some links or signpost from you    to resolve the above issues...      Thanks so much.      Victor   :-)

We have been looking at different areas and are trying to get a basis of areas that offer what we want. I travel for work so just need access to the airport, and my travel times are going to be off hours, so really not during rush hour in the morning or evening, however don't want to be an hour or more away. My wife works from home currently, however she eventually wants to find a job there and does not want a long commute. As for areas we are after...we would like an area that is quiet but not shut off from everything. We like the idea of having restaurants in an area that would deliver. I myself would like to find an area where if we buy a house I could have an outbuilding for my workshop and know most developments or places in the city would not allow that. The outbuilding is not a need, but would be nice. We would also like to have a house that has a yard, but does not have to be 3 acres. We have looked at areas such as Midlothian and Mansfield towards the south. We also have looked at Grand Prarie but that area just looks over congested. As for north, Lake Dallas, Lewisville and liked a lot of houses we found online in Little Elm. Little Elm is our current focus, but if anyone knows better area that may suite our needs, your input is appreciated. Good schools are an option, but is still a few years down the road.

20090223080755AArwJoh	Business & Finance;Investing	Partnership question - answer in layman terms only?	In layman terms, can you please explain each partner’s profit/loss amount? I need it in purely layman’s terminology as it would be much easier to convince my partner.       A friend of mine and I started a Business Last year during Christmas which was only for 3 months. All the figures are given below.      Payroll 9151   Inventory (Cost of Goods) 17420   Rent 23100   Woodwork 950   Display 200   Phone Bill 200      Total Sale amount received is 25775      Left over inventory is around 6,000, which is only good to be sold during next Christmas as this is a Christmas product.      Profit/loss  = Total expenditure – Total sales     = 51021 – 25775     = 25246.       According to me the total profit/loss is a loss of -25,246, which needs to be shared by both of us equally as this is a equal partnership business. So the loss is -12,623 per partner.      Assuming everything was on credit, and we had to pay off the credit now, how much do each of us have to pay to the creditor? I assume it is the 12,623 per partner.       My partner argues that the left over inventory needs to be accounted again, so the 6,000 needs to be split by both of us and it will be 3,000 additional losses per partner. When the inventory was already purchased, how can we double count it?      In layman terms, can you please explain each partner’s profit/loss amount? I need it in purely layman’s terminology as it would be much easier to convince my partner.

I'm seeking legal advice as to what I can/can't do.      -I have signed a fencing job in the suburbs of Toronto Ontario Canada for $58,000   -There was an error in the technical drawing, which set us back, in fact we had to tear a bit down and rebuild.   -On the very last cheque I have requested that they compensate for the error, as we've been discussing the whole time the job was getting completed.      Now, I have yet to finish the job due to the lack of or should i say 2 months and going strong delay of the last payment.      In my contract I have specified under Article 4: General Provisions      "8. In the event Project Assigner/Property Owner shall fail to pay any periodic or installment payment due hereunder, Contractor may cease work without breach pending payment or resolution of any dispute. In the event that payment continues to fail for over a period of 31 days, contractor has the right to remove any property belonging to the contractor including material, installed or not."      Now, the remaining balance is $12,000, which isn't so big, but big enough to be bothersome... (including the amount for the rebuild we had to do which they acknowledge was their fault but refuse to pay)      ======================================...   Now, given the situation, what are my legal rights and limits?   Can I charge them interest? Inconvenience fee? (both were not discussed in the contract) If so, how much can I charge?      When I do go remove the fence for the amount owed, in the event that they do refuse to pay, I want to do it as late as possible(because it is still unfinished and I know that is a very bad eye sore.... so later I remove it, the more inconvenient it'd be for them) do I have the time limit to do so? Can I remove more fencing than what is actually owed due to the labour going into demolition which ultimately is going to come out of my pocket?   ======================================...   It's been quite a hassle for me, and now I want it to be a hassle for them. They're a multi billion dollar corporation who built many different buildings in the city, and shouldn't have a problem paying.

20090223083807AA0qnQC	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Do you think the marketing of business degrees is in itself a business?	I heard that career colleges popped up when companies cut out training programs. Used to be that a company trained its employees and nobody needed a business degree to get a decent job.      But when they cut out training, career colleges popped up to fill the niche. Thing is, I've worked in corporate America for ten-plus years. I've met managers who couldn't even spell a word with more than three syllables and they graduated with business degrees. Also, career college admissions reps have backgrounds in sales, not academics...does a person really want someone with a sales background helping them make an important decision on their education? And why is it that so many people get these business degrees and then five years into their career they are unhappy/unfulfilled?      Do you think career colleges are all a big scam (unless you go into finance/marketing) and they encourage people to invest money in a degree that will lead them into an unfulfilling career? (Consider how several of these career colleges are also publicly traded companies before you answer.) Thanks!

I want to make more money so I am debating on going to this restaurant and trying to get this job.  I just hate having to give up my set schedule but wouldn't it be worth it?  I also think about how the job I have now does look better on a resume than the fast food job will look.  Should I go try to get this job?  I am living at home with my parents too and if I get this job, I could probably afford to live on my own.

And then you make a big one.. Your boss gets mad and sends a secretary to talk to you about your mistake. Then a few days later you see your boss and they smile and say hello. Do they secretly hate you? What happens when you make a mistake at work? Do your co-workers and boss think differently about you after wards? I always get that feeling. I can't help it sometimes when I make mistakes, but after I think that everyone hates me.

20090223082530AAXUUA4	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Please help us! Apt owner charging for damages?!?!?	My brother moved out of an apartment that was in my mother's name. They, of course, gave notice. My mom and I helped him move out, and everything was cleaned and left in order when we turned in the keys. I myself own rental properties, so I feel confident in saying that they premises were left in satisfactory condition.   A few weeks ago, the owners called my mom saying that they were charging her $3000 because the apartment had been vandalized! They must have known that my mom was trying to buy a home, because they lady told her "and you don't want me to put this on your credit while you are trying to buy a house". My mom felt like she had no choice but to set up payment arrangements.   This is wrong-what can we do? I think we need to ask for proof of damages and a detailed bill, but what can we do? An attorney is out of the question-my mom closes on her new home in 7 weeks and needs to save money for the closing, so she can't hire one. What can we do in the meantime?

20090223085116AAmgufI	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	How do I know our mortgage company actually paid our real estate taxes to the taxing authority in 2008 or not?	How do I know that our mortgage company actually paid our real estate taxes to the taxing authority in 2008 or not?      We bought a new house last November and this is our first year of doing Tax Return dealing with "Property Taxes, Mortage Interest, Closing Costs and Points (loan origination fees).      We made our first payment in December 08 (for January 09 payment) and received two Form 1098 from two different company, a real-estate/home building company and a mortgage company.  Box 1 and 2 of one form show $795 and $7080 and Box 1 of another form show $1007.  I think that I should sum this amount (Total = $8882) and put this on Line 10 of 1040 Schedule A.      I have a question about Line 6 of 1040 Schedule A (Real Estate Taxes).  The instruction states that "If your mortgage payments include your real estate taxes, you can deduct only the amount the mortgage company actually paid to the taxing authority in 2008."  In fact, our mortage payment includes the real estate taxes.  How do I know that our mortgage company actually paid our real estate taxesto the taxing authority in 2008 or not?  Is this amount supposed to be informed to us every year prior to Tax Return or should we somehow find out this amount (by contacting our mortgage company)?      My assumption is this: they haven't paid our real estate taxes yet because they received our 1st payment last week of December 08.      But, while searching Internet, I read "Real estate taxes and points found on your settlement statement are usually deductible on Schedule A. Mortgage interest shown on the settlement statement is usually already included in the Form 1098 you receive from your mortgage lender."  I checked my settlement statement and saw this line: "County Taxes 11/7/08-1/1/09: $100.43" under "Amount Due from Borrower" and "Amount Due to Seller."  Does this mean my real-estate taxes for 2008 is $100.43?      My question may be confusing everyone?      Stick to my original question: How do I know that our mortgage company actually paid our real estate taxes to the taxing authority in 2008 or not?

I'm an undergraduate psychology student whose next planned step is law school. Would this be a waste if I, after passing the bar moved to another country like England or France?

How much of a house can I afford?  Here's my rough financial standings:      - This will be my first home.  I'm 25, single, no kids.   - Gross annual income roughly $80K per year.   - Excellent credit history (credit score around 770)   - No student loans, no debt...I don't owe anybody anything.   - no car payment.  my current car is paid for.   - I currently pay rent/utilities in another state that I live in, about $1000 per month total.  The only other monthly bills I have is about $200 (car insurance, cell phone, givings to my church, misc.)      Also, I'm black.  Not sure if that matters, but do minorities get treated differently when buying their first homes?   What is the max you think I can buy for a home on my own?

My sister/father rented an apartment to a mother and daughter... the son who showed up 19-20 years old, has a history of stealing, harrassing landlords etc.  started really harrassing my sister and Dad.  Copper came up missing, computer, i touch phone, personal documents (birth certificate, license, social security cards etc.) they tried to say the plow truck driver did damage to their $500 car it goes on.  To get to the point... they ended up getting the apartment condemned which my family was happy about.  Problem is it has been 3 1/2 weeks and their stuff is still in the apartment.  They come by everyday and get stuff supposedly.  It is a one room apartment!  Now they have put a new lock on the door?!  My sister has an antique shop down stairs and she is not happy!

We have a rental lease with a family friend, because they were thrown out of their house (banrupcy), we all agreed that they could rent our house with intent to buy...this was over 4 years ago....during that time the house has stayed in our names (they had no credit)...and they signed an agreement that it was on a rental basis...no money set aside for sale...which we also agreed would be the remainder of the mortage when they bought it.   Since then we have paid ALL remodeling and problems....but they have started to take for granted that the rent NEEDS to be paid on time, otherwise, WE have to pay late charges...one excuse and another over the months has left us with that to do...also, there have been numerous times that other parts of the lease have been neglected.   The mortage co that had our note originally has now moved it to another...still another change or amenment that should be made...or new lease drawn up.   The people in our house recently took it upon themselves to call a window co and tell them THEY owned the house and drew up a contract with them for replacement of a NEW window....and never told me about it....its a mess, but now I'm fuming that they have breached yet another part of the lease  "....all interior and exterior changes will be decided upon by BOTH parties involved."   I was never notified....till the cat slipped out of the bag....UGH.....someone told me that the lease isn't worth the paper it is written on now because of so many changes that have taken place....is that true?

I have been working at the same place since September 2007 and was on an 8 hour contract. I began to do lots of overtime in which they were giving me an overtime rate. As I was getting an overtime rate the management decided to put me on a 20 hour contract(working Wednesday-Sunday) beginning of September 2008 and I agreed because I didn't want them cutting my hours after Christmas.       I have come back from a 2 week holiday to discover they have cut my hours below contract and are not paying me for the Wednesdays I had off. I did briefly speak to a manager and was told that payroll has been cut and it wouldn't be permanent. There are still people working there that are working there more hours than the contract. I have also looked at the schedule for the next few weeks and my hours are the same.       Can anybody suggest what action I take on this matter?

20090223092113AAyubax	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Administrative and Office Support	Am i going to get fired if i confront my boss about this?	When I started my job close to a year ago, I started as a Personnel Assistant for a staffing company. My main job duties were to answer phone, make start packets for new hires, and keep up with the start to finish of these new hires. Background checks, drug screening results etc. Pretty easy. As time went on I became more familiar with Payroll, I helped out here and there and now I basically handle all aspects of Payroll and my original job duties. Since we handle all of our new hires nationally, everything we do is sent out through fed-ex packets. So when we have a rush of 30 new hires beginning in a week, its a lot for me to keep up with. Did they return all their paperwork? Did they take their drug test? Did I send over their client paperwork to their new manager? While that’s going on, recruiters are telling me, HEY, I need 5 packets to go out overnight to these people who need to start next Monday. The phone is ringing. I still have to do Payroll for the 200 people who are currently working for us. The original Payroll Admin is sending out joke emails and videos with all the extra time on her hands since this is such “a learning experience for me”, “im doing such a great job in Payroll”. I love Payroll and I love my other job duties, it is just overwhelming. A recruiter got a promotion to lead recruiter and she is on a Power trip, only a couple of people here know how much work I do , but she tells me I need to do a project for a recruiter because it will take too much time out of his recruiting time. Im speechless because im busy enough as it is. She basically tells me in other words, “tough sh*t, its your project now. She even tells me our manager suggested it was a good idea. This recruiter doesn’t like to do new projects, he doesn’t really follow policy, he is holding on to his job by his past experience as an airplane mechanic which is what we recruit for. Im stuck as far as what to do.. What is unfair is, the so called reason I have to do this is because it is too time consuming for him to do, but all the other recruiter have to do it. It will take time out of his recruiting but is it not okay for time to be taken out of their recruiting? Why is this project being handed over to me? I do not want to do something that 1. I don’t have time for 2. Is not an admin’s responsibility 3. Is not fair to other recruiters that I do his work and everyone does their own. Do I confront my manager? What should I do? Im stuck, I don’t want to seem like im complaining to my manager and get in trouble but I also do not want to be taken advantage of. Please help

He had an internal memo from their management suggesting that they talk to all of their clients who held these accounts be transferred to other accounts.  Appearently the new money manager is doing a lot of derivitives and they have some concerns because of this.    My account is in 2 different funds.  He wants to transfer the bad one into the other account that he likes.    My question is:  Due to the economic climate, selling and transfer over into a new or existing accounts could be costly. He claims the same amount is transferred, but of course there will be fees etc that i cant see and most likely my account will be worth a lot less.  I was thinking of possibly transferring over a percentage into the money market or all of it till things start to even out.  As all of us know, the market keeps dropping and am afraid in couple of years will be almost gone.     sidenote;  i am 56;  my husband is 64 and will be retiring w/in a year.

I thought it would be because I know the 7,500 dollar credit does need to be paid back but I saw in the article that it says the credit is refundable and you recieve it as a tax refund ?      So this means to me that if you claim it on your 2008 taxes and your over all taxes paid was more than 8,000 dollars and you don't owe the goverment anymore money then you will recieve an 8,000 dollar tax refund which doesn't need to be paid back.       Is this correct??      But the 7500.00 tax credit I qualify for because I purchase a house in Nov, 2008 is not refundable and I will have to pay that back?              http://realestate.yahoo.com/promo/final-...

20090223095734AAKmFrq	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	Can I have an associate's degree and try to get some kind of social work job that doesn't required a Bachelors?	I'm at a community college here in Atlanta Georgia and was thinking about changing my major from Library Information Science Technology to Social Work. I feel that there aren't many jobs in that field and I don't really want to be a library assistant. I know I am interested in Social Work and was wondering if I get my associates degree in it, could I find a descent job and try to get my bachelor's degree at the same time? As of right now my mom only wants me to get my associate's degree because I need to get a job and I understand that. Eventually I want to get a good job and get my own place but was wondering if you guys think there is more opportunity to get a job in social work than Information Science Technology? I also heard the health industry was going and maybe I could just go to a technical school and be a dental hygienist or pharmacy technician?

20090223100831AAdZG9L	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Question regarding a revocable trust situation?	I have a friend in what I think is a strange situation.  His mother passed away and had a trust leaving her property to her eight children. There are two houses on the property, and his mom lived in one, and he lived in the other, paying rent below market value because he was maintaining the grounds and the property (1/2 acre) and taking care of his bed ridden mom.  Upon his mother's death, he moved into the house that his mother had lived in because the other house needed some major repairs and was not habitable during the time it was being repaired (had water damage inside the walls resulting in a mold problem).  One of his sisters (the executor of the property) continued to collect the "rent" and was giving the money to another sister to not repair but completely renovate the second house that she plans to occupy.  When all is said and done, he has been told by his executor sister that both are to continue to pay equal rent, and he is still responsible for maintaining the property, and if he does not pay her his rent by the 10th of the month, that he is to vacate the property by the end of the month.  Not only does this seem unfair to me, but is this even legal since he is part owner of the property and is also maintaining it?  Just wondering if anybody has been in a similar situation.  His executor sister just keeps saying she is now "in charge".  Don't the other siblings have anything to say?   Thank you for taking the time to read and answer my question.

20090223081502AAhdJVA	Business & Finance;Small Business	Do employers "Exploit" the workers or do they trade money for work?	I recently saw an assertion on these boards that claimed that all rich people got that way by exploiting the poor.  As a small business owner, I feel as though I am trading an employees work for money and that often I am exploited when they under-perform but their pay stays constant.        I have developed a formula for compensation over the years which has served me well throughout the years, is this exploitation?      Job that is needed but not profitable and does not contribute directly to increased revenue, such as janitor is paid the minimum that I can still attract and keep a worker for.      Job that directly produces revenue through the work they do, such as installer or secretary, 10% of what that job produces.      Sales/Marketing 30% of what that job produces.  Without sales, there is no business.      Nothing stops a janitor from becoming a salesman, except desire and drive, but should I steal from the salesman to who produces and give to the janitor who doesn't?       Keep in mind that just because a job produces revenue doesn't mean it's all mine!  I have to pay for everything!  Advertising, paper clips, insurance and TAXES!      Are there any other small business owners who use a formula and if so what is it?

20090223101227AAlkNe5	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	When you first buy a house, shouldn't your property taxes reflect the amount you paid for it?	I bought a house for $50,000 in August 2008.  When I received my property tax payment, I had to pay the taxes on that same house that was appraised for a little over $90,000.  I find that ridiculous that they would appraise it for almost double the purchase price.  I couldn't sell that house for $60K or even $55K in this economy.  Here is an example of how I see things:  Let's say a store is selling a pair of jeans for $100.  When you pay for them, you pay the tax on the $100.  Now let's say that those same jeans go on sale a couple of months later for $50.  You now pay the tax on the $50, not on the $100 that the jeans were originally selling for.  It's the same for houses.  How can they get away with making me pay taxes on a house that I got on "sale".  I am currently in the process of disputing the appraisal value, but I wanted to know if there were any laws in Ohio for Summit County that say that when you FIRST buy your house, the appraisal value must match or come close to the purchase price.  Now I understand that a house's value goes up every year or every few years depending on the market and the repairs (new roof, siding, concrete driveway, etc.), but I don't want my property taxes to start from an appraised value of $90K and continue to go up from there.  I want it to start around $50K or so and then increase in value and we fix it up.  Does anyone know where to find the answer to this problem in writing so that I can include it in my file when I make my dispute?  Please help me.

Of course this payday we had a little extra in our paycheck.  We would not like for this to happen.  We don't want less state taxes coming out so we don't risk having to pay taxes next year.  We were told even though he is married he can still put single on his GA state w4.  Is this true???      We have his federal w4 as married but withholding at the higher single rate.  Of course federal tax witholdings this payday were the same as the last.      I just want to make sure it is OK the change his GA w4 back to single, so they will take out the same amount before we changed it to married.

The 2009 first-time homebuyer credit is to differ from the 2008 filing year version in that it will offer $8000 in the form of non repayment.  My question lies in the actual claiming of the credit.  I had already agreed to purchase a home that my parents had used as a rental property.  The language on this year's form #5405 states the property cannot be purchased from a relative.  Does anyone know if the same language will be used on the 2009 version?  I am certainly not trying to abuse the credit in any way, however, I do feel I should be entitled.  Thanks in advance for your helpful responses.

20090223093244AABdo1i	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	How do people get away with claiming people as dependents on their taxes that they aren't even taking care of?	Every year I hear about people who take some random social security number of a friend or relative who doesn't have a job and put that person down as a dependent on their tax return so they can get money back. I have a person in my family who doesn't work, but I'm not supporting her so I can't justify putting her on my taxes to get a refund dishonestly. What if the IRS comes and asks me to prove that I've been supporting her? It just isn't worth it to me to spend the next seven years looking over my shoulder. But I know that people do it every year without batting an eye. They claim family members on their taxes and then they give that persson "a cut" when the money comes in. But they don't support that person, and in most cases, the person doesn't even live in the same house, town or state! Doesn't the IRS have a way of cross-referencing stuff like that? I'd like to see some justice in this area because I've been paying thousands in taxes because I file mine honestly while others get money back by doing this scam. It makes me sick.

I filled out and turned in forms for FMLA my doctor signed a while back and thought everything was all set. My HR manager at the time stated I have up to 12 weeks of FMLA and when I go on maternity leave, I'll get 60% of my pay until I come back to work. Just today when I asked how many hours I have left (I had to take some time off work for gallbladder surgery when I was 19 weeks) the person that's handling HR now stated, basically, since the economy sucks and they had to fire employees, FMLA isn't in effect anymore since the company no longer has 50+ employees.       If I never asked, I would've never known that I haven't been covered by FMLA since the changes. Can they fire me since FMLA doesn't protect me anymore? Was it legal for them not to tell me about the changes? Should I still be covered since I turned in the papers before the changes were made?      Sorry for all the questions...

I ended up paying them back close to $10,000. I do recall that I never receieved the 2004 California audit, but I did receive the 2002 and 2003 from them along with the FED. I only received the 2004 FED. So does this mean they can still come after me after all these years. I figure they didnt come after me when they all did at the same time so what gives now ? They are in a budget crisis and now they want to come after me ? What can I do now ? I ended up paying them all in full in late 2004 or 2005 I dont recall, but its been about 4-5years now. Is there anything I can do besides pay them ? Its only $531.70, but that $531.70 I dont have to spare.

I mean I have debit card, no credit card, so I think that it could not be taken because it's not a credit card. It said on my statement that last week, twice cahoot took 5000pounds but returned it the next day because there was not enough funds on my account, so I guess I will get it back.    First time it happened to me, does anyone know how long it may take to get sorted?

20090223111403AAy96Fh	Business & Finance;Investing	Wall Street adjustment and dangers from media question?	Initial quote paraphrased from American NPR      "When people believe the economy is a flawless system, and that everything is going, or at least better than it actually is (as both Bush's, Clinton, and Regan lead the American populace to believe) well we don't award stock prices to companies for what they're worth, but for what we think they're worth"      Obama's being truthful about the economy, and the Stock market is adjusting to the actual worth of the companies (similar to when the internet bubble burst);      Unfortunately the press is spinning the above in a way that might cause an actual stock crash, as we might stop viewing the market as it actually is and start viewing it as we think it is, this time viewing the values of companies as less than they actually are, thus causing the stock prices to reflect this belief.      Who agrees, disagrees, please try to logically support your arguments, and if possible use links to support these arguments.

20090223110626AA9VUM2	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Semi-detached house abandoned, do I have recourse?	I own half of a semi-detached house in Pennsylvania. The owner of the other side abandoned his half about a year ago and has not made any mortgage payments since. He has not forwarded his mail and occasionally I will see him.    His half was broken into a few months ago so now there is a gaping hole where a window had been. I contacted the owner and told him about the break in and asked him to repair the window so I wouldn't have to deal with any possible element or pest damage that could affect my half. He has not made the repair so I am working with the codes officer to have the repair done. The house is older and not well insulated so this hole is causing heating issues on my half.   I'm not sure why the bank hasn't begun foreclosure other than the fact that the mortgage is most likely for more than the house is worth. I would consider buying the other half of my duplex and renting it with the intention of combining the two halves into a single family home in the future.   Do I have any rights since there is a shared party wall? I don't even know how to begin looking into purchasing the other half. Suggestions?

20090223112010AALKGxQ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Rent-to-own question?	My husband and I are in the process of buying a second home.  We are considering doing a rent-option with our first home since the market is so crummy and people are having a hard time getting financing.  My understanding of a rent-option is that you charge your normal rent plus a few hundred extra a month and tht few hundred extra is guaranteed to go towards a down payment when the lease is up.  I am assuming that the regular rent would still be taxed as income - would the extra money be considered income and taxed as well?  Also, would we still only have 2 years to sell the house before it needed to be claimed as capital gains, or would the fact that it was in a purchase agreement put that off?

I found this job and started for just above half year. I am the lowest level in my work place. Those colleagues who is above my level or just a bit of senior than me always ask me to do things like photocopying and finding some files for them. I feel not very comfortable with this as my job description has no such kind of requirment. But i am hesitate to refuse them because they can help me to solve the technical questions. It seems only me being asked to do this kind of admin duties. Should I just keep quiet and being demanded to do things, waiting for their more and more requests, or should I tell them "No" .       I feel this work place is very complicated and unfriendly. I am nice or maybe over-nicely to my colleague. But I don't get a smile back. as the job itself is what i like to do. I don't want to give it up. Really Lost. and feeling bad...
