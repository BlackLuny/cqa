AcWMpmPwaa	can i answer this candidly and truthfully...look at it this way, is it necessary for a company to include a disclaimer on a product like say...a hair dryer, 'do not use in the shower' or say a clothes dryer, 'do not let children play inside while operating'. do you see where all of this is. if companies didn't have to spend money on obvious idiotic disclaimers, how much would be saved by in the cost of manufacturing and sales of that product. these are avenues for trolls like lawyers to go after capitalism. take a look at the malpractice mess this country is in today, it's not because of the health care system, it's due to the lawyers and people trying to make a buck off the system. they do nothing but hinder business and provide avenues for people to take advantage of the system.|`|lAsbD5B7aa	They have been around for a long time.<br>  <br>  No, they have not become too strong.<br>  <br>  No, they do not harm business.<br>  <br>  They do harm criminal businesses, but that is a good thing.
0nZHAaQDaa	obama is the biggest spender the biggest taxer and the absolute worst in his 100 plus days so no other has , he wins hands down|`|5rXzu0IWaa	He will never fill the baby shoes of George W Bush.

Ahhh, you know what I'm talking about.|`|aXSjRwEVaa	He's doing pretty well cleaning up the mess that was left to him.|`|xUXpfKyIaa	No one, and I repeat NO ONE will ever take the title of worst president in history away from George W. Bush.|`|7bIrMvziaa	I'm not sure, things could change. He is basically the same as Bush. I feel as if he is a puppet for the banks and possibly those higher unknown in government. Every administration seems to be higher in government power. than the one before it. Clinton's was higher than Bush Sr's. Bush Jr's. higher than Clinton's and Obama's higher than Bush Jr's. I believe that Bush and Obama are the same persona, different person.Those who want Bush back are too blind too realize Obama is nearly exactly the same. Those who hate Bush and love Obama are too blind to realize he the water in the same pipe with Bush.Our presidents are puppets. God help us, we are in the hand's of Jim Henson.|`|AA10853557	I guess I don't understand what mess you accusing Obama of making?<br>  Seem with his his approval rating, he must be doing something right,<br>  considing the big mess he came into.

THNvhp3Caa	YES! YES! YES!  If you apply it across the board, include businesses, leave out "credits, deductions, and exceptions", we could actually have rates as low as 7 or 8%!  Look at the GNP even when we are slow; 8 % of that is a nice chunk of change.  Added bonus: everybody pays the same equal rate.|`|X1yZOMYHaa	Not as it stands now, because you can't tax lower income earners at high enough levels(percentage wise) to make up for the shortfall of revenue from higher income earners. They simply can't live on that little.<br>  <br>  The budget would have to be overhauled to do it. Entitlement programs and defense spending slashed... and tax loopholes eliminated.|`|G49lKR56aa	Yes, I'd make it 10%, Federal.<br>  State and local, I'd have a flat tax also! 2.5% for each.<br>  Federal to pay for security etc...<br>  State to pay main roads etc....<br>  local to pay for side roads etc...<br>  <br>  The sad truth about us is there are taxes to be paid! 10% is a number that every one can live with!|`|fab424dc17e0236294c9f82e5e7f1241aa	You might as well give it up.  First of all, that is not enough money and second, no Democrat would vote for it since the bottom 40% don't pay any income tax, but they vote for Democrats.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Sure, as long as EVERYBODY paid it.  No loopholes or offshore accounts for the rich - no extra deductions for people who have 10 kids.|`|nr96BgWfaa	That sounds good to me, but I think 17% is a bit low.<br>  <br>  Under Obama,  50% sounds much more reasonable.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	I'd prefer the fair tax. Taxing work is ludicrous.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	10%. The gov shouldn't need or ask for more than GOD does.|`|fXdM3abDaa	A flat tax is okay on the out-bound side. A federal sales tax would be really cool. that way, tourists would pay some of the load too.They won't stop coming. If you planned to go see Big Ben and the London Bridge, would you say no because of a 10 percent sales tax? I doubt it. <br>  <br>  The Progressive tax is not such a bad thing. If I made a ton of money, I do not think that I would resent paying a little more.  <br>  <br>   What is wrong is that SO many people pay NOTHING and the top echelon pay WAY TOO MUCH! <br>  <br>   And WAY TOO MANY people get refunds that are LARGER than what the had withheld. <br>  <br>  The tax laws have way too many exceptions to the rules and it needs to be simplified. I do not think tha a young man or woman who make minimum wage and have two kids should be asked to pay taxes, but they should NOT get a refund that is MORE than what was withheld......That is a welfare payment.<br>  <br>  I believe that in no case should the Federal Govt issue a refund that is greater than the withholding. if a person needs assistance then they need to apply to their state for it.|`|hOFNlIyOaa	The lowest tax rate that the working poor today pay is 10%.  So a flat tax of 17% would be a 70% increase in taxes to the poorest working Americans.  This would destroy the working poor.  But a 10% flat tax would not bring in the same amount of money that we are now collecting.  And already running in the red, we can not afford to collect less in taxes than we are now.  So we need some gradation in the tax system.|`|b8hCMpExaa	A flat tax sounds nice and I would support it.  However the argument against it is pretty strong.  17% to someone making 15K a year is a lot of their income where as 17% to someone making a Million a year is a drop in the bucket.  Yes the person making the Million dollar salary pays a lot more he doesn't feel it the same.  I don't know what the solution is but if they can come up with one I'd support it.|`|uspTM9cuaa	I think 17% is a little high. We need to curtail government spending to be  able to operate with a 10% flat tax, and, if everyone paid it it would be enough.<br>  <br>  I think the first thing we need to do is get our individual state legislatures to demand a Constitutional convention for the purpose of repealing the 16th amendment. <br>  <br>  Then I would be more in favor of the "Fair Tax" which has been before Congress for two or three years now. See www.fairtax.org for details.<br>  <br>  With a consumption tax, and no IRS a big part of the budget goes away. That part which is spent in enforcement of an unenforcable tax code that, like the stimu less bill, has never been read cover to cover. In part because if you started at 18 you would die of old age before you could read it all, even with Evelyn Woods help.|`|TBvUomw7aa	That would be better than what we have now but I think that it could be more like 11-13%.  I would rather the IRS be rid of and a federal sales tax be added.  Yes, I am in favour of the Fair Tax.  The name really does say it all.  Since everyone blows all of their money, the Fed wouldn't suffer and we wouldn't need that ridiculous fraud/branch of the government to exist any longer.|`|yN0qzsrOaa	I would definitely support a flat tax because it's fair. Why should ANY group arbitrarily be singled out and discriminated against based on whatever criterea??? What if only blacks, women, gays, etc had to pay higher taxes based on those reasons-would that be acceptable? Of course not.|`|oBcTgt3xaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  It would be a more equitable way for everyone to contribute to the support of the federal government. There should no or very few deductions.|`|620L80L0aa	Yes, and I have read that it can be set at 13% with no deductions.<br>  <br>  If everyone's vote counts the same percentage, everyone should pay into the system at the same percentage.|`|QX38Vpdkaa	Yes, as long as there are no deductions to abuse the system and favor special interests. <br>  <br>  Greye Wolfe thinks that I should support the poor.|`|YYpI9Md9aa	Only if it was a consumption tax. I want everyone to pay.|`|Yvi4jBnqaa	That makes to much sense.The Rich Need an Abundant Supply Of Poor People.|`|84f1oaemaa	Sounds alright.|`|PPXdro1Laa	yes!!! all day every day. flat tax is the only fair way to go.. only i feel it should be on what we buy and 0 tax on income|`|kvo6ZYhZaa	yes I would.|`|6Gfz125Paa	No,  I would not support it.  It would be a huge tax increase for the poor and a huge tax cut for the rich.  Why anyone would support that, I have no idea.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	yes as it would be more fair some of us actually pay and others pay nothing, yes I would support a flat tax|`|SlhuFfuZaa	Yes! A flat tax would give everybody the same footing. By imposing a flat tax without all the gibberish that is in the tax code, one could figure out what in deductible and what is not. Actually if they set a flat tax of 10% with no deductions of any kind it would be better and simpler.<br>  I'm not religious but in the Bible it states that a person owes 10% (a tithe) of all increase, to the church, God or whatever. I don't see that the government should get more than God.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Yes, as long as there are no deductions.  Everyone pays the same percentage regardless of whether they choose to buy a home, or choose to have a dozen children, or choose to marry.  That would be fair.<br>  <br>  Would we still have gas taxes, cigarette taxes, capital gains taxes, or inheritance taxes too?  Or would these be eliminated?  I would want all other hidden taxes and "fees" eliminated.  Would we still have to pay for Social Security and Medicare?|`|30a4ee65246d549232fafd90921ce359aa	I have always been in favor of a flat tax or a Fair Tax.<br>  <br>  However, with the idiots we have in Washington right now, I hope the issue does not come up at this time.   There is not telling what we could end up with.   They could implement something like 40% because they are so out of touch with the people they represent.|`|fLH4ILzbaa	Absolutely and it's high time to flatten the IRS.

gasquENMaa	The first two charges would be MIP and MIC for the alcohol. Depending on your age, there could also be a charge of contributing to the delinquency of minors. In your question, you are stating this occurred in YOUR apartment, so therefor the MJ candy would be YOURS. That would be a charge of possession and possibly drug abuse.  With no one stepping forward to say the drug was theirs, it falls on the person renting the apartment. Personally, I would advise anyone in this situation to say nothing without legal representation being present.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you
AA11043457	No.  Why should we reward violent behavior? Has he changed or were the fights because of bad behavior of the prisoners?  Some guards may be as bad as te prisoners.  But unless I hear more about it, I won't go.<br>  <br>  Did  you see "Taken"  that was something else.  Fast paced action intensive.  Based on true story about a CIA agent whose daughter was kidnapped in Paris along with a friend. There is evidently a ring around the world who kidnap girls and sell them or use them for prostitution.  Sure is important for teenagers and parents to see.  My husband said his insides were jumping when it was over - it was that intensive. Quite violent but you were cheering the guy on.  Government was involved in it as well.  Great story if it had been fiction, but it wasn't.  Actual story didn't end as well at the end as the movie does.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No..

c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	I think it's wonderful.  It may be a sin to you, but it isn't to me.  The prevailing thought on this is that embryonic cells may turn out to be better than adult cells.  Time will tell.  Until then I think it's about time our government stopped it assault on science.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Well I guess its good and bad. The Nazi's made many medical achievements and breakthroughs by experimenting on humans but people don't like to give them credit for that.

Sorry but I don't really care about your personal religious objections.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Great Idea.<br>  I think it is better than steam cooking them in autoclaves. <br>   In science we are creating and destroying cell cultures all the time.

These can become ANY tissue.<br>  <br>  Adults have pluripotent stem cells. Some functions have been turned off, and thus cannot become certain tissues.<br>  <br>  For the best research, we NEED embryonic stem cells. I support it because embryos are not humans, and because I value the lives of people who have already contributed to society over the potential life of something not even born yet.<br>  <br>  Until you've had a spinal cord injury that has paralyzed you from the neck down - or, heck, even from the waist down - you have no right to say that it's immoral.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	I guess it's okay, as long as they are using Liberal embryos by people who do not value life.  Since no approved medical treatments have been derived from embryonic stem cell research, might as well use the useless to find the useless, since they agree with the procedure.<br>  <br>  Or maybe not.  Sometimes people need protection from themselves...|`|318386389c51a5739cd225edcf165aaeaa	There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States that allows the federal government to interfere in medical research.

Fascist movements promote violence between nations, political factions, and races as part of a social Darwinist and militarist stance that views violence between these groups as a natural and positive part of evolution.[9] In the view of these groups being in perpetual conflict, fascists believe only the strong can survive by being healthy, vital, and have an aggressive warrior mentality by conquering, dominating, and eventually eliminating people deemed weak and degenerate.<br>  Fascist governments permanently forbid and suppress all criticism and opposition to the government and the fascist movement, viewing all dissenters as enemies to be destroyed.[14] Fascist movements oppose any ideology or political system that gives direct political power to people as individuals rather than as a collective nation or race (democracy, individualism, liberalism); that is deemed detrimental to national identity and unity (internationalism, communism, class conflict, laissez-faire capitalism); that protects and empowers people deemed weak and degenerate (egalitarianism); that seek to preserve institutions and values that restrict the social or biological development and unity of a nation or race (conservatism); that and that undermine the military strength and military ambitions of the nation (pacifism).|`|ly4INzzTaa	I think you misunderstand.

Not a single Republican ever said that simply criticizing the president was treasonous or unpatriotic. <br>  <br>  What was said was the lies that you told to undermine the Iraq war were helping our enemies (who used the words and videos of Democrats for their propaganda) and were emboldening them, which resulting in more US casualties (the troops you allegedly supported). You know, when you said that Bush lied about WMD (he didn't), that troops were murdering civilians under orders, etc.<br>  <br>  When your leftist lies and rhetoric became indestinguishable from al Qaeda propaganda, it's not out of bounds to question your motives.<br>  <br>  It's sad when supposedly sentient beings believe such obvious falsehoods. No wonder you vote Democrat.

I think it is 16 now?|`|u8h3vlaOaa	Everything should be 18 years of age.<br>  <br>  Your legally an adult,at the age of consent,able to die in a war,able to drive,able to work as many hours as you want,able to purchase adult magazines.<br>  <br>  Are we really going to change the rules now because a few of us believe that it should be age 21?<br>  <br>  Why? Is there that many completely immature people in this world,is America dumbing down? Most teenagers graduate high shool at 17. We shouldnt judge our youth too harshly, im sick of the people who want to bubblewrap our society.|`|xkJZwnHTaa	I think it should stay the same. 18 is perfect because you are out of high school when the knowledge of how everything works is fresh in your mind. I am appalled by the people who think that 18 year olds are too caught up in their "teen drama" to care about real issues. I woke up to the news everyDAY for MONTHS before the election, and i spent hours pouring over the issues. College students are an extremely intelligent and important demographic and we probably care more because we are voting for whoever is going to fix this shitty situation the other generations put us in.<br>  If you can go to war and die-you should also be able to vote (on a side note-i also think if you can go to war and die-you should be able to have a freaking beer).|`|1W8OHMWfaa	Lower the voting age to 16 would be ludicrous. That is just too young for 95% population to have a logical say. It should be raised to 21 (And I'm 17 for the record) because the older we get, the more knowledgeable we get and at 16 or even 18 we are too focused on our own "teen drama" issues to really pay attention to what the country really needs.|`|LNatMloraa	it should go back to the original age of 21 with an exception for those serving in the military<br>  <br>  <br>  If we do not trust you to drink a beer we should not trust you to pick our President|`|S1EYd5WVaa	Leave it alone.

If you want to enlist, think about the Navy. They promote the fastest, and offer really good jobs that pay well in civilian life. Air force and Navy put the most emphasis on education, and have the nicest facilities and bases. I live on an Army base now and it is disgusting!!! Airforce actually pays you "substandard living pay" when you live on an army base, isn't that crazy?? Marines just are the bottom, really. They have the worst jobs, and do nothing for you in the future. If your going to do it, do it the right way. Go to college (ROTC is great and will pay your way) get a comission and join one of the two best most promising branches of the service.|`|OXGWs0fMaa	My son is a senior in HS right now and I have had a number of conversations with him lately along the same lines.<br>  <br>  The one thing I tried to get him to understand is that even with all the online options for college, it's a lot tougher to complete college while working, etc.<br>  <br>  You may think that you can do it all, but life sometimes just gets in the way.  Going to college and having that be your fulltime job is much easier.  Plus, you have many life experiences ahead of you, including those in the military.  College is one of those experiences, and in the long run could be an important one for you.  Not one that you want to miss out on.<br>  <br>  I think that you should go to college first and then off to military, whatever branch you choose.  Check into ROTC programs and also possibly the Reserves.  They can both help with expenses and start you on your career path.  You may want to do more research on colleges to find one that has a different ROTC program.<br>  <br>  And don't forget the various Military Academies, all are very prestigious.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|uKBwCLL9aa	The USMC PLC class does do tuition assistance after you complete your first 6 week class, but if you get to ocs and wash out you end up having to pay all that money back to the corps.

P544Sbmqaa	I know what you are getting, but do YOU know these answers?<br>  <br>  First, its not embryonic and basic, its embryonic and adult.  And YES, I know the difference, as I have had adult stem cell treatment.  I had a hematopoetic stem cell transplant using cord blood to treat leukemia.<br>  <br>  Do you know that it was something like 40 years after they discovered bone marrow was stem cells before the first succesful hematopoetic stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant).  Do you know that 100 years after the discovery that bone marrow are stem cells, the transplant is still a risky proceedure and many people still die while going through it?  Do you know that hematopoetic stem cell transplants comprise an over whelming majority of the the 70+ diseases adult stem cells can treat (which clearly means it has a wide range of things it can treat, but one treatment cant treat everything we have that needs treatment advancements).<br>  <br>  After all that, do you really think its fair to call embryonic stem cell research over after only 10 years?<br>  <br>  The US has activitly been researching both adult and embryonic. Embryonic stem cell research has not been federally funded, but it can be and has been privately funded and state funded.

Take Bill Gates for example.  There are some issues that indicate he was shrew and cold in gaining his wealth especially in the beginning.  But he didnt do anything illegal.<br>  <br>  Hollywood stars sports stars or popular musicians also have the ability to acquire enormous wealth, what is wrong with that?<br>  <br>  If a guy is a financial wiz and can make people a lot of money while legally making a bunch for himself, I have no problem with that.  <br>  <br>  Bernie Madoff was a crook.

261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	Amen brother. I think A Wild Boar logo would fit them just right!<br>  <br>  In order to pay for 1/2 of Obama Hood's And his merry band of congressional swine's, Hog wild spending, he would have to totally confiscate ALL of the income of ALL people who make over 75K. They are squeezing the taxpayer till we squeal. The object of the porky pig spending is to get the nation so far in debt we won't be able to lower taxes. <br>  <br>  Democrats will accuse the republicans of wanting to give tax breaks to the rich. Once that happens the party of the poor will be able to instill envy of the rich. Once the poor envy the rich, they will vote for higher taxes. When the rich get tax increases, they pay the taxes in 3 ways. They make employees work harder for less. They make customers pay more for less. They make shareholders earn less on investments. In order to get more votes, they have to impoverish more people. Their greatest enemy is tax cuts. If taxes are cut, the economy improves and republicans get more power because they will vote for lower taxes and less people will need government help.<br>  <br>  Pork = Earmarks <br>  <br>  Earmarks is simply the politically correct way to say Pork<br>  <br>  Political correctness = the insistence on the denial of truth.<br>  <br>  Get the picture?

This is pretty silly.  First of all, the GOP is responsible for 40% of the earmarks (as is tradition...the minority party gets 40%).  Overall, these earmarks that so many on the right are screaming about, comprise of about 1% of the total budget.  Joblessness is skyrocketing and all the GOP can do is worry about this tiny fraction of the budget that they are also responsible for.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	Unfortunately, the President can only sign or veto, there is no line by line choice.

The problem is we elect people to represent us, but much of the people don't pay much attention after the election. If we paid attention when policies like that came up we should be contacting our senators and congresspersons to tell them our disapproval of the policy. And if they vote it in anyways, we vote them out next election cycle.<br>  <br>  That's how it's supposed to work, but not enough people pay attention so the people who do often feel powerless since they're in the minority.<br>  <br>  The laziness of people lets government officials run wild and so the people end up with the government they sadly deserve.|`|2aLx1P6saa	Yes, in an indirect sense I guess it could be.

Business make money selling things, not from tax cuts. <br>  <br>  People lived off their houses. Like it was ATM machine. Letting housing market fall deeper into hole with more foreclosures is going to hurt more then not giving tax cuts. Its sharp depreciation of house values that blew up everything. Because everyone lived as though house prices will go up and up and they can always draw out equities. Basically living on phony money. <br>  <br>  I doubt tax cuts gona magically solve something like that. There arleady is provision to give tax cuts on pay checks.

Eligible commissioned officers on active duty were automatically converted to Regular Army on/or after Veteran's Day, 11 November 2005.

N7G26k4Iaa	Lobbying is not necessarily what you describe.  Victims' rights groups, or environmental groups, for example, do not ply politicians with all the freebies but many other special interest groups do.  But you correct to be concerned.  There is a fine line that lobbyists can easily cross over.  That is why there needs to be more transparency as to the contacts politicians have with lobbyists etc.|`|IYdgEQ4kaa	Yeh what you're talking about is influential gift giving or flaunting of royalty.<br>  <br>  The difference between lobbying and bribery....lobbying is legal.|`|5RsAzyiVaa	Giving gifts like you described is illegal.  No person can give a public official large gifts without reporting it, otherwise both the person giving the gift and the official receiving it can get in trouble.  And if they want to contribute money to a campaign, they have to donate through a PAC.  The job of most lobbyists is to research an issue and give information to Congressmen.  Since most Congressmen are busy and have too many issues to think about and vote on, they rely mainly on information provided by lobbyists.  Information that lobbyists give will convince a person to vote a particular way.|`|xkzkCtrUaa	More like a campiagn...well I guess its the same thing

pcHp7Dgkaa	It all depends on your occupation and whether you have sponsorship or not.<br>  <br>  As of the 1st January 2009, a ministerial directive completely changed the priorities for visa processing for skilled workers. Until then, visa applications were largely processed in order of lodgement and everyone who qualified eventually got to the top of the processing pile and was assigned a Case Officer. Now, visa applications are processed strictly in order of demand and new applications with employer or state government sponsorship and those for high priority occupations are processed before any other applications, regardless of when the applications were lodged.<br>  <br>  The new priorities are:<br>  1? Employer sponsored<br>  2? State government sponsored<br>  3? Occupations on the Critical Skills List (CSL)<br>  Only the 3 categories above are being processed at present.<br>  <br>  After the above, and when all applications in those categories have Case Officers, processing MAY begin on applications with jobs on the Migrant Occupations in Demand List (MODL)<br>  And then, Skilled Occupations List (SOL) occupations.<br>  <br>  Right now, if you have employer or state government sponsorship, you will be allocated a Case Officer within 10 working days.<br>  If your occupation is on the CSL, all CSL applications are expected to be allocated to case officers by end of May 2009.<br>  MODL applications are not being allocated at present, but when allocation begins, they will be processed in order of lodgement (and there is a large backlog).<br>  <br>  The following explains the priorities and has links to the CSL and MODL:<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/pdf/migration-program.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a>|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	it depends where your from and what is your occupation and if you are being sponsored or not<br>  <br>  i think they are only processing from the critical skills list right now<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/pdf/critical-skills-list.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a>

Hoovers stock market crash was due to conditions he inherited, not anything he did himself.  Come to think of it, Jimmy Carter is in that club too. <br>  <br>  But Hoover thought nothing needed to be done.  He called it a 'depression' because at the time that sounded less serious and less permanent than 'recession.  He kept insisting that 'prosperity was just around the corner', while all around him things went to hell, people lost their life savings, lost their jobs and homes.<br>  <br>  Obama is more like FDR, a man who took positive action to stimulate the economy, and in the meanwhile helped people who'd lost through no fault of their own.|`|D6kwriPxaa	Wow..you blame Obama for all this in his first 45 days?

They would have been lost because of the economy under George W. Bush.  We are still feeling the effects of his fiasco.  George W. is the worst president this country has ever had.  Obama didn't cause this mess.  Unless you've been in a coma for the past eight years you should know that the economy has sucked for a long time.  If you'll remember there was a huge surplus under the Clinton Administration that George W. gave away.  He said it was the right thing to do but in all actuality, he was buying votes with that.

5Ho518J9aa	Most folks can't drop cash on a car. I did, in October. I was going to buy one at the dealer where I returned my old f'lease, but the guy looked as if I was wasting his time, because I'm younger. Well, I took my business elsewhere, and I'm glad I did. The guy was humble, happy, and even gave me a warranty, and gave me a heartfelt thank you. I took the guy's picture, so I could send family to him. He's got 4 kids, as it turns out, and two are in college. My Wife's uncle went over and bought a used truck, and my mother in law plans on grabbing a used SUV in another few months, when her f'lease is up. Folks, I know times are tough. If you need a car, and you have the cash, pick up a nice American car. I love both of mine, and I would never buy a foreign car if I had the opportunity to buy American. Even if you buy used, you're supporting the dealer's staff, and they are all right in your area.|`|1amF7oNwaa	Most people are going to buy the best product or service for the money.|`|K8Ca1sU3aa	Just about everyone purchases goods from other countries and don't even realize it (or think about it).<br>  <br>  Ford and Mazda interchange parts on their vehicles...My FORD truck was assembled in Mexico...there's a huge TOYOTA plant in San Antonio, Texas.

nwMBfgcdaa	There are numerous ways and it really all depends on where you want to work.  <br>  French is an excellent idea if you plan on working in New Brunswick, Quebec (obviously) or with the RCMP.  It won't hurt anywhere else either. <br>  Being physically fit is a good bonus.  I would suggest Jujitsu, Judo or other martial arts that teach things like wrist locks, grappling, and other open hand techniques.  Boxing is good but Police tend to try not to get into a fist fight.  They teach you things at the academy anyway, so no need before you go, its just a bonus.  <br>  To be honest, the most useful courses I have taken were English and typing.  You do alot of paperwork and these courses are a major asset. Any computer courses are also beneficial.  You don't need anything specific, they will give you all the courses you need at the academy, but the courses I mentioned may help you personally<br>  If you plan on University first, there is a Bachelor of Community Studies (BACS) program that Police like to see.<br>  There are several ways to become an officer.  Again, it depends on where you are and where you want to work.  Many agencies do their own training such as Edmonton, Calgary, Quebec, Ontario Provinical Police, Toronto Metro, Halifax Regional and Royal Newfoundland Constabulary to name a few.  Some of these pay you while you attend, others may not.  The training received here is only recognized by the department offering it, however, after working for 5 years, you can apply to other departments.  <br>  Then there is Police Academy.  I know of on in BC, the Justice Institute I believe and in PEI, Holland College.  You pay for the training, then get hired after graduation.  Almost every department on the East Coast recognize their training (with the exception of Newfoundland) and some out West.  I am not sure about the Justice Institute.  <br>  Then there is the RCMP.  They do their own training at Depot and you can be posted anywhere in the country.  You also have to do some time up North at some point in your career.  <br>  Again, pay depends on where you are.  Most of the major departments make decent money.  You can always make more in overtime.  <br>  Where I am it is a good paying job.  Cost of living is lower here.  RCMP are better off here.  They make around $70,000 I believe.  That's great here, but if you are posted in Vancouver, it doesn't go nearly as far.    <br>  Pros and cons, hmm, that one is kinda long.  It can be a frustrating job dealing with the same people, same issues all the time.  People hate you for what you do.  People are rarely grateful.  You deal with death alot.<br>  Then again, I am not stuck behind a desk (although there is alot of time spent in front of a computer doing paperwork).  I am always entertained, people are strange.  You will never see it all.  It can be exciting and you have opportunities to go places and see things most people never will.  <br>  Policing is not like it is on TV.  <br>  If you don't want to mention where you are on here, you can email me, I may be able to give you more specific information.<br>  <br>  Additional answer-<br>  Absolutely, the Reserves would be very beneficial and it would look good on your resume.  Volunteer work would help as well.  It can be anything, as long as you are serving the community.  <br>  Some examples of pay:<br>  Ontario Provincial Police pays 32,436.00 during training.  Top salary (first class constable is 75,926.00.  They have their complete pay scale on the website (below)<br>  Toronto cadet training is 45,042.34, first class is 71.522.91.  <br>  Durham Police cadet training is  47,902, first class is 73,696<br>  It usually takes a few years to reach first class, depends on the force.  <br>  <br>  Training for all of these departments is done at the Ontario Police College.  It is a post hire institution, which means you apply directly to the force you want to work for and if they hire you, they send you to the college.|`|20e7c8068c2f57f36d81b72364a63f61aa	<a href="http://www1.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/pe/lmi/wages/wage.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www1.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/pe/l...</a>|`|CIGRQqd7aa	HA.<br>  <br>  I am thinking of this, easy way to pay off loans.<br>  <br>  First off, you don't need **** aside from a High School diploma, your average means nothing, just have the diploma.<br>  <br>  Getting a College or University degree simply speeds up the process and can get you a better post in an office instead of the streets.<br>  <br>  First thing you need to do is go to a cop station, any one, and ask for info on how to get in Police Academy/Traning Program.<br>  <br>  And you should be on your way.<br>  <br>  Average starting salary is roughly 50,000 a year.

tROFU72waa	Wow, I'm so sorry you had to get lied to like that.  That recruiter is the 1% that makes the rest of the Army look like sh!t.  I can't apologize enough.<br>  <br>  I would contact JAG and see if they can assist you in filing your petition to regain custody for your child.  If they can't then I'd hire an attorney that specializes in this.  I have seen single female Soldiers regain custody after taking the route you took so I know it can be done.   You can say something about joining the Army, and say that you were trying to get your life together so you can take better care of your family, learn a skill, get some money saved up, have insurance for your family etc...Make no mistake, you'll be surprised at how much it'll mean to the court that you've done this FOR your family.  I wish you the best of luck hon.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	1. Your recruiter did NOT lie to you.<br>  2. You could NOT have joined with custody of your child as a single parent.<br>  3. A family care plan would NOT have solved the issue that you had for enlistment.  Coming in as a single parent and becoming one while in the service (by divorce or pregnancy during service is two totally different issues and situations) <br>  <br>  A single parent can NOT enlist and keep full physical/legal custody of the child. They are not supposed to give up custody for the sole purpose of enlistment and they are not supposed to seek out custody within their first enlistment. He did NOT lie to you nor did he screw you over. he did what he is supposed to do, actually in all honestly you should be thankful that he let you slide with the fact that you gave up custody to join. <br>  <br>  A family care plan would not have fixed the situation and would not have made you eligible to join. You still would have had to give up custody. If you get custody back then you will be required to have a family care plan at all times. <br>  <br>  Coming into the service with an issue like being a single parent and becoming one during your time in service is two DIFFERENT issues. Those who  get divorced or pregnant during their time in service are not in the same category as those who are trying to join.|`|AA10709853	if you are still on your FIRST enlistment you cannot get custody back,  I f you have re enlisted, you CAN.   but the military won't help and you will need that rock solid Family care plan in place before you seek custody in the courts.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	A family care plan is not used in your case.  <br>  <br>  You did have to sign over custody.  <br>  <br>  You need to hire a lawyer and go to family court to straighten this out.  You should have verified all your information before doing anything.  Your congressman probably isn't going to do anything.|`|LcAiHBsaaa	Yeah... unfortunately you should have done some more research before listening to that recruiter.  I am prior service, and now have a child, and just the other day when I went to talk to an Army recruiter, he told me the same thing... that when I get done with my AIT then I can have custody of my daughter back.  I know this isn't true after doing all my own research online.  I don't know if the recruiter is just not knowledgeable or what, but I keep hearing different things, so I'm just planning on worst case scenario.<br>  <br>  In regards to your particular situation, there is a chance you won't have your children back... are you out of the service now, or still in?  I've also heard of getting your children back after your first enlistment, but once they have become stable living with their father, there is a chance the judge will say that the it is in their best interest to remain with their father since the home life is more stable there and they have been doing just fine there for the past five years.  Not trying to get personal, but why did you wait five years to begin fighting this?  I'm just trying to throw questions out there a judge may ask is all... not judging you at all!<br>  <br>  You can't join the service as a single parent, PERIOD, so that is why the recruiter offered the suggestion of giving up custody to their father.  Family Care Plans are for people already in the service becoming single parents, for people who become parents together while serving (ie both parents are in the military) and if you gain custody while in the service due to something happening to the other parent, or the other parent becomes incapable of caring for the child.  They don't let single parents in, even if they do develop a Family Care Plan... unless it is the reserves, but that's a different animal there.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this, :)|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	Honey I am so sorry your recruiter screwed you over, I would get the recruiter to, when I went active duty as a single parent I got a POA, this way it is temporary and you get your kids back. <br>  Myabe that goddam recruiter thought it would be easier for you and the kids if your ex took the kids, I mean their is no 24 hour daycare if you are put on a detail after 6PM or if you work the weekends, but still, a POA is all you needed to join and I would sue his *** for it.<br>  I can tell you it was hard for me, not being able to find a babysitter when I had to show up at 0400 in th emorning for a range or do EOC (emergency ops) and was put on th enight shift, my last unit liked ot work 24 hour ops all the time and my son got stuck watching my daughter alot because no daycare was open. <br>  I am not condoning whatyour recruiter did, but your recruiter did you wrong!!!

He needs to show he can bring something to the table, skills, education etc.  A work permit holder needs to live in the UK for 5 years before being able to apply for permanent residency.

rJSD3iCHaa	Through ROTC when you graduate and recieve your commission from you school, you can apply for an educational delay.  You will have your three years to graduate law school coming into the Army then as  CPT in JAG.  Only caveat is, most likely you will be paying for your education or other scholarship.  I have two friends who both went this route, I myself considered it but went straight in as an Armor officer instead.  One friend is still in JAG, the other is a Corp in NYC.  Best of luck to you, ROTC is a great program.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	You do not pursue that degree while in the military, you either have it prior to enlisting, or you use the GI Bill to make getting it easier.  Your choice.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	If you don't need the money, then don't join rotc now. You can join regular  nrotc, nrotc mo or rotc in Law School and it will pick up the tuition for at least two years. Army rotc has a three year program so it could pick up the tuition for every year of law school. If you did a combined JD/MBA or similar 4 year program, the nrotc or nrotc mo 4 year program would pay the tuition all 4 years. <br>  nrotc, nrtoc mo and rotc pay full tuition.  afrotc is usually capped at 15,000/year.<br>  The Law Schools at Berkeley and UCLA are going to cost around $40,000 next year for in state and Davis is going to be around $35,000.

If you don't need the money then I wouldn't suggest it. There is a program that will take someone with a pre-law or Poli-Sci degree and put them in a fast track commissioning program. I would recommend finishing law school and passing the bar (to become a lawyer in the military you have to pass the bar in a state, any state) and deciding from there. A civilian career would be much more lucrative and would have better benefits than a military career for someone with political aspirations. In the military you don't get to deal with law making.
IdtzdpqGaa	the easy answer is talk with a recruiter, they have the most up to date info, to go officer you will need a four year degree, but that is the way I would recommend.

That is not a hypothetical, it is a fact and one our Founding Fathers knew well..<br>  <br>  Republicans wanted to focus primarily on tax cuts as the solution and the Democrats' bill relied primarily on government spending with only a small part being tax cuts.  It is intellectually dishonest to claim that the Democrats' bill in any real tangible way was anything like what the Republicans proposed..<br>  <br>  BTW the growth if the Federal government must lead to eroding freedoms,.  That is not a hypothetical, it is a fact and one our Founding Fathers knew well..<br>  <br>  The fact that big government must infringe on individual liberties is not reliant on the fact that the founders knew this also.

The Khobar towers?<br>  <br>  "Named the Hart-Rudman commission to report on nature of terrorist threats and major steps to be taken to combat terrorism"<br>  <br>  Which goes to show that he didnt do much. When you slough it off to a committee, youre pretty much washing your hands of it all.<br>  <br>  "Clinton Administration sent legislation to Congress to TIGHTEN AIRPORT SECURITY. (Remember, this is before 911) The legislation was defeated by the Republicans because of opposition from the airlines."<br>  <br>  Lie. This was stopped by Al Gore.<br>  <br>  and on Sept. 19, 1996, Vice President Al Gore, the panel chairman, wrote to the airline trade group, saying that "it is not the intent of this administration or of the commission to create a hardship for the air transportation industry or to cause inconvenience to the traveling public."<br>  The next day, TWA gave $40,000 to the Democratic Party. Former administration aides say the donation was unrelated to Gore's letter and was not unusual, coming in the final months of a presidential campaign.<br>  In February 1997, the commission adopted a final report that reiterated its recommendations, but also called for the FAA to "shift away from prescriptive regulations" - specific rules - and move instead toward a system that would "set goals and encourage the industry to achieve them."<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.thefiringline.com/forums/showthread.php?p=758975" rel="nofollow">https://www.thefiringline.com/forums/sho...</a><br>  <br>  "Clinton Administration sent legislation to Congress to allow for BETTER TRACKING OF TERRORIST FUNDING.

It was defeated by the Republicans because of opposition from the NRA"<br>  <br>  They wanted to add it to black powder. Which no terrorist in the world uses. Plus adding the tagents would have made the black powder unstable and dangerous. <br>  <br>  "Clinton Administration increased the military budget by an average of 14 per cent, reversing the trend under Bush I"<br>  <br>  No he slashed the budget, but the Republican congress put the funding back in.<br>  <br>  "Clinton Administration tripled the budget of the FBI for counterterrorism and doubled overall funding for counterterrorism"<br>  <br>  False. It was the Republican congress. As a matter of fact, they gave more funding than Clinton asked for. <br>  <br>  "Clinton Administration detected and destroyed cells of Al Qaeda in over 20 countries"<br>  <br>  Lie.<br>  <br>  "Clinton Administration created national stockpile of drugs and vaccines including 40 million doses of smallpox vaccine"<br>  <br>  He created it by confiscating half from the companies that produced them and stored them in warehouses without the proper conditions. Result: They all went bad and spoiled, unused, and the medicine he didnt confiscate went up in price.|`|pgdTmT6caa	No, Bush did his job and never blamed anyone for anything that they did.

Maybe Clinton policies were responsible for the recession, although most economists would disagree with that accessment. In any case, the economy was still growing when Bush took office, not growing fast by Clinton era standards but still growing faster than it has at any time since then. To say that Bush "inherited" a recession is a plain disregard for the facts.<br>  <br>  I don't mind you GOPs voting for McCain and not supporting Obama's efforts to defend America, but I do mind you trying to justify your beliefs by making things up.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	Honestly the recession is somewhat due to a failed policy from clinton, look to the fair housing act.

Brothers and Sisters of every walk of life, I call upon you to stop bickering about who said and did what.  It's hard to not look back and not want to point fingers, I realize.

They sit i lawn chairs complaining about how hard they work & how they pay so many taxes. Yet they have no clue as to how life works. The don't care that Clinton handed Bush a surplus of almost a trillion dollars. Then Bush did nothing with that money except steal it. It is OK that Bush ran up a trillion dollar debt yet they are upset when it comes to spending money so our economy can support itself.  Libs are making fun of Jindal cause he has no substance. He danced to the podium like a fairy but performed no magic in his speech.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	No its just that his own message was bashing his own party is what it came across as.  When a government leader talks to someone like they are hard of hearing or just flat out dumb its rather insulting.  The way he was speaking gave the impression that he was talking down to the nation and that is in my opinon one step above a delivery.  I do get what you mean completly though and I agree.  But it was more than that with Jindal he was almost talking down to America like we were stupid and didnt understand.|`|v1a0PHdwaa	No the message matters Jindal LIED there honey, there is no train in the Stimulus bill from L.A. to Vegas, since that is a proven lie nothing else he said can be trusted<br>  <br>  God I hope you people run that idiot in 2012 he'll get his butt smacked down with the quickness|`|3YRrGfkiaa	No.  The delivery WAS terrible, but the biggest problem with that speech was its content.

But while there are people who want to retain their British pride and not be a slave to political correctness, then Britain has not totally surrendered. Our Government may have, but a majority of citizens haven't. <br>  <br>  Personally, I believe that although we are being walked all over right now, if things got too serious, and Radical Islam DID start heavily impacting on our lives, British citizens would not tolerate it, and would take matters into their own hands. I for one would anyway, I am not going to be dictated to by a Muslim, I will not be bound by political correctness, I will not change my beliefs and I will not surrender to a bunch of extremists.<br>  <br>  Some liberals may say I'm racist, but I'm just proud to be British.

PwHQSAxvaa	The link doesn't work. But really the unions as a major political force is ancient history. The large nationalised heavy industries have gone. The days of tolerating unofficial, unballoted strikes and flying pickets is over. This is not just a matter of legal sanctions. The NUM once contributed to the downfall of a government. But at that time it had thousands of members and could call a halt to power generation. Times change. And rightly so.

God will not allow it for long when we do.  God gave that land to Israel and who is one stupid American to tell God that Hamas has rights on His land.   Rice did it and now Clinton.<br>  Arafat before he died was the absolute biggest liar that ever lived and he has left many like him in Palestine.

yvPA8FSsaa	Nothing like that.  What he is doing is simply running key phrases and concepts past focus groups to see what the American Public wants to hear.  Then, he loads up the beginning of his speeches with the maximum amount of these key phrases.  The second half of the speech is diametrically opposed to the first half.<br>  <br>  He does this all the time.  Read any speech he has given since becoming President.  Last night the first half of his speech was all about fiscal responsibility, cutting waste and handling the taxpayers money responsibly.  Hell, I would stand up and applaud that.<br>  <br>  But in the second half he is promoting spending many more hundreds of billions on unnecessary programs and other "investments" such as green energy research that we really cannot afford now and do not even know for sure is the correct course to lead to green energy.

XTDeAfTqaa	I've been called up for jury duty four times and have never once been selected as a juror. Many cases are settled right before the Trial starts.<br>  You don't decide their fate (unless it is a death penalty case which the Jury can recommend life or death), you just decide whether the defendant is innocent or guilty. The Judge decides the fate of the convicted.<br>  Don't sweat it. Just pay attention.|`|5c07eea93e2b7eb3dfa4e16ee3a3c43eaa	Yes I have done jury service.  Bear in mind that when you go in for jury duty, it does not mean that you will necessarily have to sit through a trial.<br>  <br>  For each jury trial several potential jurors are brought into the courtroom.  The lawyers then get to ask the jurors questions, this process is called voir dire.  Each side gets to remove potential jurors if the answers to the question lead them to believe that the person cannot be impartial.  Each side also gets to remove a few potential jurors for no reason, simply because they think that you or someone in your demographic would be harmful to their client.  If you get removed, you go home, duty done.<br>  <br>  If not, you have to sit through the trial.  Not all trials are criminal trials either, you may be deciding whether or not one company owes another company money.  You just have to show up and find out.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0z2WHCaFaa	My memory is that it is quite boring. You can sit around for a long time waiting to be called so make sure you bring something to read with you. As for deciding someones fate all you can do is listen carefully to the evidence and don't be afraid to share you views with your fellow jurors.|`|AA10106002	Not scary, educational and very interesting.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I've been called four times as a petit juror.<br>  <br>  If it helps, think of it this way...you are going in with an awareness and respect for the role---which makes you a better candidate than someone who goes in with an ax to grind.<br>  <br>  Do your best...people need to serve to keep the system going.
X81oLqMtaa	There is nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  Reagan DID NOT end the Cold War, despite the fantasies of his rabid followers.  The Soviet Union was in a state of decline for a decade before he even took office.<br>  <br>  Reagan DID turn the US from a lender nation to a debtor nation.<br>  <br>  And yes, Carter did inherit an economic mess from Nixon/Ford but did a poor job of placing the blame on his predecessors.|`|8PCriC7Vaa	Don't let the throwbacks hear you say that; they think he was the greatest politician/strategist/statesman to ever wear high heeled boots. One sick puppy.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	What "statement"?  I only read a rant.  And no question.<br>  Well, here's an answer:  Reagan's dead.  Has been for years.|`|AA10783710	You are so deeply and thoroughly wrong I practically don't know where to start.<br>  <br>  First of all, Reagan most certainly DID pull us out of "something".  Depite what the self-professed "Republican" below claims, Reagan DID end the Cold War.  It is so childish that nowadays we feel this need to denigrate real heroes. <br>  <br>  Consider this very likely scenario: if Jimmy Carter had gotten a second term in office, the Soviet Union would have continued their massive expansionism. Maybe you forget this era, but the Soviet Union's influence around the world was growing at an alarming rate. Already, most of Western Europe subscribed to some sort of Socialism, so the final acquiescence to Communism would not have been that big a jump.<br>  <br>  Anyone who does not believe this should listen to what high ranking KGB Soviet defector Bezmenov says on YouTube about Communism.  I moved to Prague about two and a half years ago.  In travelling around Europe and Russia I have been able to talk to people who know the truth:  Russia was poised for huge expansion, not disintegration.  The tide of history was going their way, and they could all feel it.  Grabbing up new terroritory was getting easier with each passing year and they figured they'd infiltrate Europe enough that they'd practically vote themselves into Communism.<br>  <br>  When Reagan entered office, all his advisors, especially the economists like Galbraith and Samuelson, told Reagan that the Soviet economy was in great shape, and actually outpacing the United States. They told him that a policy of trying to bankrupt them would be fruitless, and maybe even backfire. They were totally wrong. Everyone was wrong... except Reagan. The money he spent to ensure the demise of the USSR was the best money we ever spent.<br>  <br>  Ask anyone knowledgeable the growth of the high tech field, and they will tell you that Reagan's tax credits for corporate R&D are what led to the high tech explosion. The economy we enjoy today is in large part due to his savvy viewpoint that businesses need to invest in the future, and that such investment will reap innumerable rewards for all of society.<br>  <br>  Before Reagan entered office, the United States was demoralized. Everyone talked about how our best days were behind us. Even more alarmingly, you started hearing more talk about "moral equivalency" between Capitalism and Communism, as if our government were preparing us for the fateful day when we'd have to acede to the USSR's international mastery. We were deeply mired in the Carter "malaise", and no one had much hope for the future.<br>  <br>  Then, just like John Wayne galloping on a white stallion to rescue the beseiged fort, Reagan took a demoralized nation that had largely lost confidence, and made people believe in a bright future. That is the mark of a truly remarkable President.<br>  <br>  At that point in history, we needed someone to bring us out of the malaise of the grim Carter years. Reagan took office when everyone had aging, rusting cars, ugly avocado green appliances, a shrinking salary, and few people believed there were bright times ahead. He made us proud to be American. <br>  <br>  By the sheer force of his optimism and buoyant personality, he made us all believe that the best times were yet to come, and so investors took heed.|`|45cb74f9b5bb495b15a6f3f0a1d5c694aa	Seems like you pretty well nailed it here except you didn't add that even then Cheney was running the show via Bush.  Reagan was just a mouthpiece and it was during that time in history that all the criminals who have robbed this country were put into place.  This is what will come out with a Truth Commission.  There are some great threads on Democratic Underground on this subject this week.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	I always thought reagans first 4 years were brilliant.  He did turn the country around...working with a dem congress.<br>  <br>  Beirut was not a great move - the Marines when I joined in 86 hated him.<br>  <br>  but his last 4 years were not so great with iran contra and his decline in health.<br>  <br>  <br>  his tax plan worked but it should have been changed back to even higher taxes to lower what started to be a road to one heck of a debt that we now carry.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Actually, carter inherited a recession from Republican Gerald Ford. carter's feeble attempts to improve the economy made the recession even worse over his four year nightmare of a presidency. Thankfully carter lost his reelection bid to Ronald Reagan in an epic electoral college landslide.|`|E6EbbZXzaa	What's wrong with that statement is all the misused words. You've managed to strangle history and forcible fornicate with it.|`|reeU4N0eaa	caldude, was the Soviet Union in miltary decline before or after they invaded Afghanistan?<br>  <br>  And yet the black Brezhnev says his wanted to sound Reaganesque during his speech.|`|y2ywR3X9aa	Why dwell on a man who has passed away? Move on. What do you prefer by the way, trickle down economics or trickle up poverty?|`|Wez0ZK4Vaa	spot on...you forgot the part where he cut & ran from terrorists in Beirut|`|V44ARW4maa	well, there you go again, spouting facts and truth.|`|zWRJVJdOaa	It doesn't say anything about ketchup being a vegetable.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	Well, it seems like Andrew Jackson did a better job with money: he is the ONLY President to have ELIMINATED the National Debt. <br>  <br>  And Clinton left Bush with a +/- $275 billion surplus. Now, 'surplus' doesn't mean that there was a huge pile of cash on a desk somewhere, it just means that he spent $275 billion LESS than what was allotted in that year's budget. <br>  <br>  But that also meant that the National Debt actually stopped growing... it was in the $5trillion+ range at that time. When Obama was sworn in, the National Debt was over $10 trillion.<br>  <br>  And while Bush racked up over $5 trillion in debt during his 8 years in office, and that IS a shltload of money, he still managed to neglect:<br>  -infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc)<br>  -environment (not signing Kyoto accords, etc etc )<br>  -healthcare<br>  -National Parks and public lands and public buildings<br>  and so many other aspects of life and limb: weakening  or flat-out ignoring protective laws, such as the SEC/banking fiascoes which resulted from his anachronistic belief in a self-regulating free-market economy.<br>  <br>  And look what deregulation of airlines and phone companies did for America: the airlines are dying financially and watch out if your phone or phone line have problems.<br>  <br>  Ronald Wilson Reagan... 666 .... truly a devil incarnate. A B-movie actor who read his lines while his anorexic bltch of a wife consulted psychics to chart the course of our nation. <br>  <br>  Good grief.|`|p9rbEdpdaa	What's wrong with this statement is that he wasn't a "brilliant" actor. He was a pretty average actor in all of his other rolls, though he did play his presidential role in a satisfying way to many. Other than providing the country with a father figure, his administration didn't accomplish much and set the stage for the economic woes we face today.

FKN9kBvLaa	If Jesus Christ were elected the recession wouldn't be over right now.

That's an order!|`|AA10329269	No. Recessions are cyclical part of the economy. Without government intervention (bs stimulus packages) it probably would have worked itself out in the next 6-12 months. <br>  <br>  But doubling the deficit in one day clearly doesn't solve the recession - it just creates more problems for he future.<br>  <br>  oohhbrother - hitting bottom would actually be the best thing right now. Bottom is inevitable - Obama is only prolonging it.|`|SSLekPAnaa	It would be well on it's way.

9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	I think that people should have the right to terminate their own life, and they should be permitted to seek medical help to do it in a safe and painless manner.

Having suffered from depression for a year back in high school, I can say that getting help is the better option. I worry that people would employ euthanasia for things other than terminal illness.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem I have with it is the potential for it to be used by relatives to get rid of a spouse/parent/etc. that impedes their life or who's death would result in a lot of money. One of my relatives ordered the nursing home to stop feeding his two parents who had Alzheimer's.  I went to visit his mother (my great aunt) and was sickened by what I saw. She was begging for food and water, wandering around with lips cracked and bleeding... It took her a month to die.  She just didn't have the muscle coordination to feed herself.  He is known in the family to be one greedy SOB so we all know why he did it.  These types of people exist, and we need to guard against them misusing their power over their relatives.<br>  <br>  Let me say there are many cases of assisted suicide that are pretty straight forward, the doctor on the battle field giving an extra morphine injection to the man missing most of his body, etc. We just can't trust people enough to legally allow it.

piYGWTiMaa	It's not politically correct to criticize a liberal. If they do, they'll be crucified by the liberal main stream media.

ELAsvwE3aa	Slavery has been around since the beginning of history, and still continues today.  African blacks do not have the monopoly on the "I was a descendant of a Slave card."   Your statement is true.  A large portion of the slaves were sold to white slave traders by Black Africans.  These captured individuals were usually from a enemy village.  <br>  <br>  I am not sure why the seller is not as hated as the buyer.  I suppose the 200+ years of degradation has forged some hostility in the black culture.  I can understand the root causes of this anger, but I as a thirty something white male, had nothing to do with what happened to blacks of the past.  All I am responsible for, is how I treat people now.  .|`|YDjoAKROaa	First, if you ask any person with a decent level of intelligence they will tell you that the Africans were wrong for selling off their own people.  However, Americans are at fault because of the way they treated their slaves.  Look at the diplorable conditions they transported the slaves in and how they treated them once they got them to America...those that lived through the terrible voyage, anyway.  It's not just the fact that slaves existed, the issue is more of the treatment of them.|`|AA10586974	You are right.  Africans should pay reparations to the ones they sold|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Who bought them?|`|AA10465540	You are neglecting the fact that Europeans went to Africa to purchase the slaves.  Your excuse is similar to saying that it is the pushers fault that the junkie steals to buy drugs.  Slave traders made pretty good money as well, and for a time, the plantation owners did fairly well using slave labor.

Most of the time police can charge everyone in the home if there are drugs. I knew of a older couple that had a son that had a small bag of marijuana in his room.

AA12332649	Students have a 4th Amendment Right to Privacy:<br>  <br>  The specific question upon which the Supreme Court granted certiori was, "Whether the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule applies to searches made by public school officials and teachers in school."<br>  <br>  The exclusionary rule comes to us from the Supreme Court decision in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States.  It says that when evidence comes from an illegal source, it must be excluded as the "fruit of a poisonous tree."  If it is illegal to search a student under the 4th Amendment, then the evidence must be excluded. <br>  <br>  This is somewhat modified by the school interest in maintaining discipline and safety.  Before a student may be searched, the school must have the equivalent of reasonable suspicion.  The student at issue was smoking and was caught in the act.  This was the equivalent of reasonable suspicion, because she was observed in the act of violating school discipline.  When she was searched, she was found to be in possession of marijuana.<br>  <br>  The rule of law is: the student's privacy interest must be balanced against the school's interest in maintaining order and discipline.  Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches conducted by public school officials, and in this case, the search of the student's purse was reasonable.<br>  The issue was not whether a student may be searched, it was whether they may be afforded the same 4th amendment protections as adults.
lNtwpzpOaa	Yes. He states he is Catholic and by receiving the Eucharist, he is also saying that he is in full agreement with the Church. <br>  <br>  He shouldn't be supporting abortion and saying he is Catholic. If he isn't in agreement with the Catholic Church then he shouldn't be Catholic. <br>  <br>  Abortion will always be against Catholicism. It should be against all Christianity as well and against all humanity. No one should be for abortion, but for a person to stand up and say that they are Catholic and believe in something that is against Catholicism it hypocritical.<br>  <br>  Also, one person said that in the Bible there are times where abortion is acceptable. NO WHERE in the Bible is abortion acceptable. The Bible in itself breathes life and God condemns anyone who uses potions, teas or the likes to cause an abortion or who beats a woman to cause an abortion. The laws are very strong against that. <br>  <br>  As God must be present to create life, no child is unwanted by God and we have no reason to be deciding when a person's life should end as that should only be God's decision.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	No, I don't as there are times where the Bible does seem to suggest that abortion might be alright. (In the case of the pregnancy putting the mothers life in peril) Just because someone is pro-choice does not mean they want to go around performing abortions willy nilly. It means that there are some reasons that an abortion might be needed and they are willing to leave it open so that if it is needed, they can get one.<br>  <br>   There is also the thought that God did not keep us from having a choice about the matter so why should we take away a person's right to a choice. (Especially if they are not Christian- who are we to make the rules for other people)|`|lTx8Hoheaa	No, since making abortion rare and making it illegal are mutually exclusive. It is completely possible for abortion to be almost nonexistant and still legal, as the Netherlands have shown us. As a Catholic, I could care less if it is legal or not, as long as it doesn't happen.|`|JCxE0mq9aa	If Catholics want to propagate the Vatican and Pope Benedict the XVI over the vast majority of Americans who profess other beliefs then they should not run for offices.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	It's morally wrong for a Catholic person to support abortion. Some of them try to get around it by saying they are personally opposed to abortion but don't believe the law should prevent it -- which is Biden's view, if I remember right.<br>  <br>  But this doesn't wash. If I believe that it would be murder if I aborted my unborn fetus, then I would also have to believe it's murder for Sue or Sally or Shaundra to abort her unborn fetus. Unless I put myself in the untenable position of saying that MY baby is a valuable human but Sue's or Sally's or Shaundra's is not. <br>  <br>  Politicians who claim to follow a religion (ANY religion) but support policies that are diametrically opposed to what that religion (ANY religion) teaches strike me as being untrustworthy, two-faced, deceitful hypocrites. That's not the kind of person that I want as my leader.<br>  <br>  Of course, it's really, really, REALLY hard to find a politician who belongs to a religion and upholds it in their jobs. At least Barack Obama is very plain in acknowledging he doesn't have much use for religion. He said he only became a Christian because he found a group of Christians who were doing good work -- it had nothing to do with Christ whatsoever, so one can't expect him to actually follow Christ's teachings.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	No I don't, the pope however feels differently.<br>  But it seems to me that people should be able to separate their duty to their constituents from their religious beliefs because their constituents have different religions, and we are not a theocracy.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	the "make abortion rare" policy makes no sense whatsoever- are some babies worth saving and others not?  <br>  <br>  and yes, it's entirely hypocritical to oppose basic Catholic theology and then call yourself a good Catholic- maybe he just needs the votes?|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You fail to distinguish between supporting abortion and supporting a person's right to make up their own mind.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Is he a Catholic?

I am not catholic but I am religious and for that reason I am pro-life.  Just because they are in support of the "choice" does not excuse them religiously from not caring about the child and I believe one day they will have to explain that.  It's a contradiction to thier faith and they need to pick one or the other.<br>  <br>  JCORBMAN-Our government believes in seperation of Church and state---that does not speak for our churches.

I do not understand how Pelosi, Biden and gang can call themselves "good" practicing catholics and then support the worst evil of our day.  Our bishops are not doing them any favors by allowing them to still receive communion.  In my book they should be very publicly excommunicated.  Their faith obviously means very little to them.|`|fdee9f2f8c3353271f559676ca2a4337aa	It's highly hypocritical and indefensible, and there's no excuse for it.

There was. Then that left me wondering who the hell Dr. Lawrence Britt was...which led to Google....which led to the following....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://civilliberty.about.com/b/2007/09/10/one-nation-underrated.htm" rel="nofollow">http://civilliberty.about.com/b/2007/09/...</a><br>  <br>  From the above blog, by Tom Head About.com guide to Civil Liberties <br>  <br>  "During the 2004 election cycle, an email chain letter began circulating, attributed to one "Dr. Lawrence Britt, a political scientist," who had apparently written a 14-point article listing the defining characteristics of fascist regimes. There was something to the email, and we'll get to it in a minute, but first let's address a few misconceptions. First of all, there is no "Dr. Lawrence Britt." The author of the 14-point fascism inventory, Laurence Britt, is a former corporate executive who wrote and published a dystopian novel about right-wing extremism, titled June 2004, during the height of the Lewinsky scandal. That is, to the best of my knowledge, his only published volume.<br>  <br>  In the real June 2004, he achieved some level of fame with an op-ed published in the humanist magazine Free Inquiry. This op-ed was forwarded around from inbox to inbox, and readers eventually began putting a "Dr." in front of his name and referring to him as a political scientist who had compiled the fascism inventory independently of the Bush administration. He had not done so, and had never claimed to do so. The article was, and had always been intended to be, an argument against the Bush administration.<br>  <br>  Does that mean that his article is invalid? Not at all. All of the 14 points he identifies can potentially threaten our civil liberties, and they are all points that the United States has in common with the twentieth century's most frightening fascist regimes. THE TROUBLE IS THAT THEY ARE ALSO POINTS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS IN COMMON WITH MANY NON -FASCISIT REGIMES, AND IN SOME CASES REPRESENT LONG STANDING ELEMENTS OF U.S. POLITICAL CULTURE.

This is not a guess, this is what has always happened. The poorest who the extremely rich democrat billionaires who don't pay taxes have fooled, will suffer worse than anyone. The extreme rich democrats who actually control most of the media and entertainment industry, and the democrat party leaders and officials who have used the poorest for tools against the country, will benefit more than anyone else.<br>  <br>  The democrats have about as much worry about fair, as the mob does.

Tell us, just how much do the wealthy keep in those off-shore accounts?  Many loopholes have been closed.  Can you tell me exactly what loopholes you are referring.

If you look at the same kind of statistics -- percent of total wealth owned by, percent of total income earned by, percent of total tax burden paid by -- and go for the top 0.2% and leave out that not so rich 1.8%, then you may be shocked by what you learn.<br>  <br>  But to get back to your questions, if they earn 90% of the wealth then why shouldn't they carry 90% of the tax burden? Americans don't earn money or posses wealth in a vacuum; they earn and own in the context of the structures and systems of our nation. A person with an income in the millions is obviously getting much more benefit from these structures and systems. What is unfair about expecting those who benefit more to pay more?  <br>  <br>  You seem to be proposing that wealth, in itself, is not sufficient reward for having a high income therefore those with high incomes should be further rewarded by shifting their portion of the total tax burden onto those who earn less. Such a system would also rest on the principle that NOT having wealth isn't sufficient punishment for not reaching a high income level, and those with modest or low incomes should be further punished by having more of the total tax burden shifted onto them. I am astonished that this is any intelligent person's idea of fairness or justice!<br>  <br>  Consider that being in the high tax bracket is voluntary. No one holds a gun to the heads of the wealthy and forces them to amass greater wealth. If a wealthy person decides that it is no longer worthwhile to be wealth, he or she is always free to become poor and enjoy that pleasant life of leisure which (according to some) is the lot of America's poor.
DnzL2zWQaa	You ask a very good question.  And no, I don't think it is possible for many people to admit that the person they voted for has made serious mistakes.  <br>  <br>  Obama has brought this to a new level.  I have never seen people so emotionally irrational over a President before.  I don't think it is possible for many Obama voters to admit fault - I honestly believe that they think he is a savior of some kind.  <br>  <br>  I voted for Bush & he made mistakes.  I think he did a lot of things right & did a great job making our country post 9/11 safe from terrorism.  That being said, I never believe ANY politican 100%, because they all spin what they say.

VlOr2IUTaa	First I would get rid of about 80% of government.  I would get rid of income tax and replace it with a national sales tax and raise import tariffs. The governments job would be to enforce the constitution and protect us.  We would not be policing the world and getting involved with ever other country's problems.  I would decrease the amount of welfare handed out, or at least put strict regulations on it.  If you are not handicapped or injured, you should be working or in active search for work.  The government should not be giving hand outs to those that just don't feel like putting forth the effort to earn an honest days wage.<br>  <br>  With less government, less welfare, and less war, we would be sitting pretty with a strong economy.|`|YTJ5Upneaa	Get someone in office who actually knows what he is doing.

But they need to be liable for not reporting stolen guns.<br>  <br>  People in rural areas often depend on hunting for food<br>  <br>  I think people who live in the desert and on large farm lands should be allowed to collect automatic weapons because they have the room to play with them and there's less chance of someone stealing them|`|p9rbEdpdaa	The fact is that very few liberals feel that all guns should be outlawed. The fact does remain that we have both one of the highest rates of violent crime and the highest rate of gun ownership in the industrialized world and contrary to you rather novel argument it is not because crimes in other countries are not reported. I think you can go back into our own history during the "wild west" period when a large portion of the populace carried guns and see that it was not really a deterrent to violent crime.|`|e4755faeab1ce327b95c1129793886a7aa	No.  You won't find more than a handful of Democrats who do, either.

But I believe there should be some restrictions on some weapons. 50 caliper, a bazooka, a rocket launcher, and assault weapons shouldn't be allowed to be owned. Same with some types of ammo.<br>  But overall most handguns and rifles should be protected under the 2nd amendment.|`|CVtwbIKLaa	We are missing the point - guns are not the problem.

BAMIDY BAM BAM!"<br>  <br>  ***Obviously the current policy is failing us. Stricter policies most definitely need to be enforced. You are correct, a typical child cannot purchase a gun. It is the irresponsibility of the parent who purchases it for them, or that child is part of a gang with connections.<br>  <br>   For the illegal trafficking of guns being sold to criminals they need to be diligently tracked and eliminated. It should be made extremely difficult for trafficking to occur with very harsh punishment implemented if found doing so. If you have no criminal background and age 21 and over, you should not have anything to worry about; unless of course, you are trying to pack militia. And why would you want that for your home?

(Which is them entering here illegally) As for the economy, do people really think our government is going to deport them? That is their main source of income!  Many illegals DO file taxes and the ones who don't, get taxed on a daily basis. Yes they might send money to Mexico, but a little money goes a long way. Illegals in America do pay rent, buy cloths and food. I don't see illegal women working construction! They work at restaurants, hotels, etc. and get taxes taken out of their checks yet they don't file. Where is their refund?? That's millions of dollars going into the governments pockets!<br>  <br>  How can people blame them for coming here! In Mexico they cannot even afford what we call "necessities". They have nothing to lose! People say, "They broke the law" SO WHAT!! Did they hurt anybody?? Who doesn't want freedom, education, and a better future for their children?<br>  <br>  If they want to blame somebody they need to blame the border patrol. Money Talks!!<br>  <br>  Americans say they are stealing jobs, but I know many contractors who rely heavily on mexicans because they do the job and do the job right!  Whereas Americans worry about how much vacation time they will get, or how much money they will earn, or what time they will be getting off. When Mexicans are happy making however much they are paid and working as many hours as the day will give them!!<br>  <br>  I agree they should have came over here the right way, but you cannot tell me you would not take a stroll across the border for freedom and money!|`|arZQTSjiaa	they use Yahoo answers as a means to voice their opinions without any repercussions from the state.

Not for long though & not real happiness. What they want is joy & happiness is dependent upon outer things. Joy is what you have inside. How do you have that when you have to constantly work for something else, the nicer car, the dream vacation, the better house? I saved money when my kids were little & we lived like we were poor on purpose. While the trips we could afford thanks to saving were great there were times when I would sit under a tree with my boys & tell them a story. You can feel joy from that, that is unlike any other feeling. Rep.s hate treehuggers & anything that people do that brings a great simple feeling. So while they hate poor people they are hurting themselves much more. Resentment is something that will eat a person alive.

Do we have to give them a steak dinner every night? <br>  <br>  What is a "quality life" to you? Some might argue that a truly "quality life" would be one where you can stand proudly on your own two feet and say "I might not have a lot, but what I have... I earned." That's kind of where my husband and I are... and believe me we're not rich... but we have a quality life.<br>  <br>  Edit: Skirted around that one didn't ya? The point... in case it escaped you... is that Libs are great about tossing out emotional, feel-good rhetoric because it is indefinable. After all, who doesn't want to help the poor?

Everytime he opens his pie-hole, the market tanks. His economic policy is even worse than Bush's, and I thought that was impossible. From the moment he secured his Party's nomination, the market has lost half of it's value. The 6 weeks in office means nothing to the market, because the market is FORWARD looking.

Of course he isn't the most hated man in America - that title belongs to Rush Limbaugh at the present.  A majority of Americans still approve of President Obama and the job that he is doing.

He is appeasing to the corporations who funded his campaign, not the John Does who gave him small donations, and he definitely isn't helping Joe Small Business Owner.<br>  <br>  Besides he has a fascination with Executive Orders, so he obviously doesn't care what people think, neither did Bush, so I guess if its either Bush or Obama, i think either assassination or maybe buying an island from Canada and starting a new republic is the best answer.|`|wlGVy803aa	BO doesn't care what people think or feel.

That fact in and of itself is quite telling:  the majority of Americans are not using the gray matter and are quite willing to be deceived.|`|5COJmUOWaa	Oh no.  He most certainly is not.

Or maybe James Inhoff or Tom Delay.  Karl Rove maybe.|`|r6dsc5fNaa	He has a 70% approval rating, so he is by far not the most hated man in America.<br>  <br>  But, I think by "America" you mean "Yahoo Answers."

"Hurrah for the Blackshirts" was an infamous headline from the 1930s. It dropped Moseley in the backlash that followed the well publicised events of October 1934, when Blackshirt thugs brutally beat male and female hecklers at a rally at Olympia. This happened to coincide with Mussolini cutting of the flow of cash that kept Moseley afloat and with Moseley's increasing anti-Semitism. It supported Mussolini & Hitler up to 1939.<br>  <br>  It is Royalist, and loves the aristocracy. It is lowbrow and anti-intellectual.

Capitalism is a cruel pyramid scheme<br>  <br>  The solution to the spreading economic crisis and the deteriorating social position of the working class lies not in the reform of capitalism, for it is beyond reform. The crisis is of a systemic and historical character. As feudalism gave way to capitalism, capitalism must give way to socialism. The key industrial, financial, technological and natural resources must be taken out of the sphere of the capitalist market and private ownership, transferred to society and placed under the democratic supervision and control of the working class. The organization of economic life on the basis of the capitalist law of value must be replaced with its socialist reorganization on the basis of democratic economic planning, whose purpose is the fulfillment of social needs.<br>  While employing democratic rhetoric to legitimize its rule within the United States and to justify its use of violence all over the world, the contemporary American state retains at its disposal repressive mechanisms of unparalleled scope: a prison system that, with more than two million people behind bars, is the largest in the world; a massive and heavily armed police force; a judicial system that processes over 14 million arrests annually and that has the power to inflict capital punishment; an immensely powerful and lavishly funded military force, imbued with militaristic and anti-democratic sentiments; and a vast “national security” apparatus, which has been given extraordinary latitude in spying on and prying into the private affairs of the people. Over all these institutions the American people exercise virtually no effective supervision or control. Torture has become state policy, habeas corpus has been drastically restricted, and the state operates, in addition to its public prisons within the United States, an international gulag network of secret prisons into which nameless individuals, deemed “enemy combatants,” are made to disappear.<br>  Democratic rights established in an earlier historical period have been drastically eroded. Lincoln’s democratic vision of a government “of the people, by the people, for the people” has long since degenerated into rule of, by, and for the rich. The right to vote means little in a political process regimented by an institutionalized bipartisan “two-party” system that guarantees the monopolization of election campaigns by the two corporate-backed political parties. The existing electoral set-up excludes effective participation by parties opposed to the Democrats and Republicans. Ballot access laws have been designed to prevent challenges to the two-party dictatorship. Likewise, freedom of the press means little when the major media outlets are controlled by powerful corporate interests.<br>  The defense of democratic rights is inseparably bound up with the struggle for socialism. As there can be no socialism without democracy, there will be no democracy without socialism. Political equality is impossible without economic equality.<br>  <br>  Capitalism exists today because of the betrayals of the working class by its own organizations - the mass political parties and the trade unions. “The world political situation as a whole is chiefly characterized by a historical crisis of the leadership of the proletariat.” These words, with which Leon Trotsky began the founding document of the Fourth International, remain supremely relevant as a definition of contemporary political reality. There is not a single mass organization in the world today that presents itself as an opponent of the existing world capitalist order, let alone summons the working class to revolutionary struggle. This has created a surreal environment, in which the anger and discontent of the working class is suppressed by the old, politically sclerotic organizations. But as Trotsky also wrote in the founding document of the Fourth International, The Transitional Program: “The orientation of the masses is determined first by the objective conditions of decaying capitalism and second by the treacherous politics of the old workers’ organizations. Of these factors, the first of course is the decisive one: the laws of history are stronger than the bureaucratic apparatus.”|`|cr5EoqVjaa	This question is non-sensical. There is no "socialist approach" other than spend, spend, spend and hope something works. Actually, I believe that Obama knows it won't work and doesn't care.

JDAbWnJraa	After having left active duty service, I continued my service as a reserve drill instructor and this would be my two cents. <br>  <br>  Trying to use the military as a way to straighten someone out would be misguided at best. The military can teach an individual such things as discipline, attention to detail and courtesy, but they must be open to learning such things. The military can also help a person to FIND and develop inner strengths, courage and honor, but a person has to possess these things at even a basic level. Absent any of these basic traits, a person will certainly wash out at the basic training level when they fail to acknowledge and respect authority or obey orders. Additionally, the alcoholism will only lead to greater problems in the service. Alcohol flows freely amongst a group of Type A personalities, so it isn't like it's a rehab program in the barracks and his failure to control himself and keep it in check may lead to a less than honorable discharge. And the last thing to consider is whether he can truly be part of a team when the chips are down and lives hang in the balance. He'll serve with a platoon of 35+ other men who will be counting on him to shoulder 110% of his weight when the tracer rounds start zipping past.  The Armed Forces can not work miracles, they can only develop what a person already possesses.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	It really depends on the person.  I've seen people like this get a dose of reality and grow up and I've seen them fail because they could not grow up.  If this guy truly wants to change then he very well may succeed.  Though, not being able to control his drinking can lead to problems.<br>  <br>  As for your friend, he needs to seek professional help to overcome his demons.|`|zmmP52P3aa	if he fails in the military then he is a determined screw-up, not just lazy or unguided.|`|VeWD8Io2aa	No.<br>  He'll be booted out PDQ!!<br>  The mil is tired of the "what's in it for me" generation and instead of disciplinary measures most cases are handled by dishonorable discharge. Only people who want to be in the mil are safe. If you have any problems with authority, we don't want you.|`|AA10742996	Definitely. If anything will make a boy into a man it's the discipline necessary to serve in the military. I was changed for the good from my service. Most of it took place in the first 3 months in boot camp.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	no becuase he will keep being immature and just cause hell for the rest of his division.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	The military will make or break you.<br>  <br>  He needs to lay off the booze. You will get into a world of trouble if you have alcohol related incidents. (drunk driving, drunk on duty, fights, or sleeping late, messy uniform appearance...anything that alcohol messes up)<br>  <br>  If he has low self esteem. He should talk to a professional counselor about it. I don't know what the PTSD is about. If he has a history of child hood abuse or something like that, he really needs therapy. (are you saying the young man you want to join already has PTSD? or are you afraid he will develop it?)<br>  <br>  At this point the military could make it worse for him. While a lot of young people do well in a structured environment, some can not take it. If he already has issues he will have a hard time.<br>  <br>  He should go to school and learn a few job skills and build up his self esteem. If he gets his head clear and sobers up then consider the military.|`|AA10551203	The military will definitely mature you real quick. They will also teach you responsibility.

At least the military will provide a steady paycheck, training, and a level of supervision that is much more than any other opportunity.<br>  <br>  I've seen screwed up people remain that way in the military.  I've also seen some join and really find their nitch.<br>  <br>  A friend's nephew was pretty much messed up and had some serious legal troubles.  He joined the Army for Explosive Ordnance Disposal.  He failed one of the tests during his EOD training and was deployed to Korea until he can come back and retake the course.  His aunt was very impressed with the changes she saw and he seems to be on a better track.<br>  <br>  Pros:  Job.  Money.  Responsibility.  Living quarters.  Food.  Health care.  Clothing.  Exercise.  Supervision.  Chance to be a leader.  Potential for advancement.<br>  <br>  Cons:  You can't just 'quit' or change your mind.  Serious legal repercussions if you screw up.<br>  <br>  I think the self esteem may be a bit of a cop out.  True self esteem is based on real achievements.  Completing basic will give a sense of accomplishment.  Contributing as part of a team will give a sense of accomplishment.|`|OWfu0VfVaa	yes...i was an irresponsible, immature 23 year old on my way to jail or death when i joined. I am now a 27 year old responsible adult with a wife and kid. The military really straightened out my life. At first I thought it was a huge mistake, but after a few years I realized how far I had come. I went from not being able to provide for myself and having no goals or ambition, to helping out others and trying to progress as far as I can in life. I'm not saying that this is for everyone, because it is not. There is still a lot of BS you have to put up with, but it worked for me.|`|YWqWb7JSaa	The military will defiantely grow him up fast. All of the immature tendencies that he is so proned to right now will be drowned quickly. But, he has to be willing to take the pressure that the military will put on him. It is hard work and long days. His DS will not baby him and will not care that he is homesick! However, they want everyone to succeed and they want to turn you into a good soldier. But they won't put up with sissy, whinny babies so he is gonna have to have a tough gut. The military will provide him opportunities that he may never have thought possible though. I would say that they choice has to be his but it could be a very beneficial one. Best advice: tell him to find something that he is truly interested in. If he could do anything in the whole world, what would it be? Then talk with a recruiter about the qualifications that are required for what he wants to do. The sky's the limit and he could do just about anything... given the determination and desire. But those two things are pre-reqs for a soldier! Good Luck

I mean having a house with empty rooms doesn't circulate the economy as much as someone who goes out & buys a house they use. Your are brainwashed about this just like Joe the plumber who actually is unemployed. Why would he be worried about someone making over $250,000 when he had no income? Can you look at him & see he is sick. Many of the people who are having their taxes raised are liberal. They know that it doesn't hurt them. They have a nice house, cars, education for their kids, everything & would rather help the country to have a sound foundation. I wish I could talk to you about this because I can't explain in details here but you are the one that can't see how this money that is not needed by people can be helping our country. This money comes from poor people who work for this people & it is just greed on one end causing an imbalance...I know a man who threatened his employees saying he would have to lay them off if his taxes were raised. He just did that out of greed. He is not going to shut down his agency & he needs those people to make his huge salary besides if he didn't make so much & they did lose their jobs someone else would get his customers & they could get another job & if they worked for someoen less greedy they would probably make more money....why should someone who makes 1/2 million a year be so important when someone making $200,000 a year or less can do the same job....I have a hard time understanding the concept you have stated because I was poor as a kid & now live well & I can see I can give more because I have more so why should I be required to give less.

Look at it this way, if there was a fixed tax percent-depending on the magnitude of the rate- the rich would get richer and the poor gets poorer(if the rate is high) or  the rich becomes super-richer and the poor becomes rich( if the rate is low). Now everybody would want the low rate, but soon every would be the same-there will still be lower,middle,and upper class. Thus, they have to base it off the amount you make.

CUVYxMF1aa	Vote no because it's a sin|`|kprKXEOSaa	I support civil unions, because homosexuals claim they just want the same rights as married couples.  Civil unions are a way to give them that, without calling it "marriage."  There are other couples who could also take advantage of civil unions, too, not just homosexuals.  For instance, spinster room mates.  It seems like a nice compromise to me.<br>  <br>  I doubt, however, that even if civil unions are accepted in every state in the union, it will be the end of the debate, because I don't believe that all homosexuals want are rights.  I believe they want acceptance, and until they can get married in any church, temple or synagogue in the country, they will say they are still being discriminated against.  <br>  <br>  So, yes, I support civil unions, but I know that won't be the end of it.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I would vote no to marriage of gays but not because its a sin.<br>  <br>  Civil unions are just fine with me.|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	To be a sin, it would have to be in the Bible right?

ugWaptu2aa	The abbreviations are probably just the manner in which the arresting officers write, the trooper gave you the best suggestion about what they could mean. <br>  <br>  He was charged with possession because even with residue the the substance can still be considered intact. Sounds like the arresting officers were just tacking on as many charges for any infractions they were seeing. <br>  <br>  It is difficult to say what kind of sentencing he will receive because that's up to a judge or a jury if it goes to trial. Because the crime happened in Georgia and he was arrested in Georgia he is subject to Georgia's law and will have to attend his court dates in Georgia. <br>  <br>  The best thing that your friend could do at this moment is to find counsel. Depending on what he said and what he did and what is written on the report his attorney could try to convince to the prosecutor to drop the obstruction charge or could even try to reduce the charge to paraphernalia rather than possession. Again this all depends on what GCSA states.

However, I think whether we are at war or not, the military will always have somewhere to deploy troops. My husband works with 7 other people in his chapel (chaplain assistant), and they've all deployed... He's the ONLY one that's been deployed to a war zone (Iraq). The others went to South America, Greece, Korea, etc. So even excluding the war zones, there are plenty of opportunities for deployment. <br>  <br>  Also, combat camera is an insane amount of deploying (at least for AF standards).

Rwn0svq0aa	I was listening to a lecture on the history of taxes just the other day. In 1913 the party that wanted taxes only wanted to tax the rich, and they then would put a cap on taxes at ten percent.  The whole notion being that the rich can afford to pay taxes. It was believed by both sides that taxes would not spread throughout America because the people could not afford to pay taxes. Then the first world war was in full swing in 1918. The demand for taxes went up by 700% in order to fund the war. Due to national emergency it was prudent to extend taxes and to uncap the amount of taxes the government can charge its citizens. And since that time, we have had a national discourse at times impolite on the idea of how much taxes.  <br>  For the church to pay taxes would put a stranglehold on religious practice and would intermingle the Constitutional aspect of separation between Church and State. I see no good coming from taxing the church because the nature of being taxed is like an invasive species that intertwines and kills the host. While we see these mega churches who by the way have non-profit arms under the tax code, most churches are not mega churches. Most churches are small and barely make ends meet. It is for this reason a visitor will quickly hear, faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. Now, having said that, the Catholic Church has the Vatican, it's own monetary system and occupies Rome. I don't know what you would call the Vatican under a tax code. It may warrant a judicial review and a test case on how best to tax this multi tiered super-system of religion.  The Catholic Church in it's entirety is a unique case. It is beyond mega church in scope and reach, however, I still do not think it is in the best interest of Rome for the Catholic Church to be taxed in the United States. As you know taxing a church will stifle church independence and free speech against government. This is a well known fact. We see this same dynamic in Russia, China and Latin America. Imagine the church facing off with President Chavez in Venzuela, that is like going against the mob, because the church can be extorted and would be in that situation. Which leads me to my final point. If America taxes the church we would no longer hold the title of being a beacon of hope and freedom.  It would become rhetoric.  We should want that title and preserve it. It is what distinguishes the United States from all other countries. Interesting question.|`|TxRRITveaa	No it violates the seperation of church and state.

The theory here would be that the rock was the tool and it entered the building.  If this was a residence, the maximum sentence is six years in prison.  If it was not a residence the maximum sentence is 3 years in prison or it could be filed as a misdemeanor with a maximum 1 year in jail.<br>  <br>  The defense here would appear to be that they did not intend to commit a felony or theft.|`|flkVehA9aa	They are charged with attempted burglary because the broke a window.  This sounds like attempted burglary to me.  You say it was a misunderstanding but then you don't explain.  They are lucky they did not get shot and killed.<br>  <br>  Unless they have a really good story and some solid evidence to back it up, then they will be found guilty.  For a first offense the sentence will be light.  Probably a few months and then probation.  The problem is they now have a criminal record that will follow them for life. It's hard for criminals to get good jobs.|`|AWSmknxLaa	the only reason to break the window was to get the stuff inside.<br>  Just because they were caught before they finished, they still are guilty<br>  <br>  a little jail time might help
JDAbWnJraa	I had just posted this in response to another persons question, but I think it could fit for you as well. Good luck.  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Having served 6 1/2 years active duty Army Airborne (Infantry), 2 combat tours and then 6 years in the Army Reserves (Drill Instructor), I will give you these little pearls to consider carefully. Whether the Reserves, or the Guard, it is a great way to learn a life skill that could potentially improve your quality of life in the civilian world. Now that the flowery recruiter type stuff is out of the way, let's cut to the chase...<br>  <br>  Our nation is at war right now and the Reserve forces and National Guard troops are being activated and deployed in to combat zones regularly. So, this choice can very well end you up in Iraq, or Afghanistan. Now, when I served on active duty, we ate, slept and **** fighting 24/7. When my unit dropped in to the suck at any time, we were ready and I was surrounded by hardcore professionals which increases your chances for survival exponentially. Not to knock the Reserves or the Guard soldiers in any way, but they are part timers man and that is the plain truth. Yeah, you may have a couple of active service vets in a reserve or guard unit, but that only helps THEM when the bullets fly. Bank clerks and shelf stockers from the Home Depot in town are not gonna react and respond in situations the same as a squad or platoon of guys who have done this stuff together as a team for a long time. <br>  <br>  So you wanna serve your country and that is awesome. I just always hated when we had a guy in the unit crying about how he only joined for the college fund and never thought he would actually end up in a firefight. So all I ask is that you know what you're asking for before you raise your right hand. Believe me, it isn't an easy way out of ANY situation and the pay sucks anyhow. Those that serve, serve because of a higher calling inside of them.|`|Q7ovix19aa	You will be aiding your state and country.  You will be reducing the size of the regular army by being a part of a reserve.  You will be ready to help in disasters and armed conflicts.<br>  <br>  A negative part is grunge and grungy work.  There could be serious danger, even to your life.  You may need to kill people, or help do that.|`|AA10980983	My husband is in the Guard and most of the time he has been deployed.1st for those who THINK that the Guard is a "part time job"they obviously have no clue what they are talking about.My husbands last deployment was 22 months and he was in Iraq doing convoy escort and QRF.The guard USE to be 'the Weekend Warriors"now they do more than ever.<br>  I have heard the stories and seen with my own eyes the physically and mentally destroyed from that deployment.I have met friends of my husband in THE GUARD who went down in a chopper and was the only survivor and had to fight in that position for 15 days alone until help came.I have heard the stories [and met those involved] of taking fire and returning fire upon the enemy after an EFP destroyed an armored vehicle and a GUARDSMAN went into that burning vehicle while taking fire to pull out 2 of his fellow soldiers while taking fire he sat on top of that vehicle and covered the injured with his own body without thinking twice.And didnt even recieve or ask for recognition.<br>  And I think that anyone who is in the military should be ashamed of themselves when they "bash" another military branch because ofwhat they have heard.Unless youre there you dont know.<br>  Yes you can get your tuition paid for school,the drills can be boring,you can be called on for disasters,[humanitarian service],you can be deployed to other states and to other countries,and you may work for a moron.<br>  Sorry,for getting on that "soap box"but I am beyond sick of people saying things about the guard.If you havent been in then you dont have a clue.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	The positives:<br>  Good training and experience (resume)<br>  Real world application in a deployment environment<br>  You may even have fun<br>  Health, Dental, life insurance options in a part time job<br>  Bonuses, Education incentives, etc.<br>  <br>  The negatives:<br>  Can be time consuming if you are trying to pursue other civilian obligations.  It's hard to succeed at school, work and the Guard sometimes, esp if it's leading up to a deployment.<br>  <br>  There are morons in all branches of the military, sometimes it seems to be a little more concentrated in the active army because so many young people are going into the Guard to pursue college sooner.  They're usually a tad more responsible.  You'll get as much out of the military as you are willing to put in.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	I was in the guard. <br>  Pro's: You can learn some new things, meet some new people, get to try some fun stuff. Basic training and the schools you might go through are annoying at the time, but you look back on them with memories. College funding is nice. Good for your resume. Deployments can be exciting<br>  <br>  Con's: Average drill weekends can be boring as hell. Deployments can be inconvenient and/or very dangerous. There are some real morons in the guard, and you might end up working for one.<br>  <br>  All in all I say the Guard is a good thing, a noble cause, and worth joining. Its not for everyone, but it was good for me. I started off enlisted, and went officer through Guard OCS. Good luck.|`|hcIz81Tbaa	Positive is Money for Collage and boot camp can be a hassle but it is just to weed out those who cant hack it.<br>  <br>  Negative possible long deployments to far away places if you are married.|`|aAHgFFvGaa	The National Guard is part of the Army. (DoA, Department of the Army) Therefore, there's a higher risk of going overseas. The National Guard, doesn't have all the training. Basically, it's like being in the Army Reserves, just on active Duty.<br>  <br>  However, the National Guard is the ones that stay stateside a lot. What I mean, is they do a lot of relief efforts for disasters, they, and Marines are the ones that guide the president etc.

5mCm2XTLaa	First offense, I doubt it. Seeing you still a minor I double doubt it. Worse case is a heavy fine and the loss of your vehicle. That would only happen if you were caught deliberately and maliciously destroying endangered vegetation. In California that would be like spinning donuts in a field of California Golden Poppies.<br>  <br>  I had a similar thing happen to me, only it was trespassing and illegal cutting of timber for firewood. Nothing happened but they sure made me sweat for a while.<br>  <br>  EDIT: In my case the fine could've been as high as 10 thousand dollars and it was a federal offense seeing I was on federal land. I was caught by a forest ranger on the wrong side of a fence I never even knew existed. <br>  <br>  The ranger had me follow him to the ranger station. There I was detained for about an hour and released after they took down all needed information. Naturally they also confiscated the wood I cut, about a cord; pretty much enough to fill a standard pickup bed. <br>  <br>  I was told to expect a letter within 15 business days telling me to report to the federal building in Los Angeles for a hearing. The letter never came but like I said they had me worried for a time. Hopefully in your case as was mine they're bluffing.|`|z58jBAtGaa	Hopefully  you didn't really do too much damage and you haven't been in trouble before.... You probably won't go to jail, but you may be on court supervision and have to do some community service. I would guess that your fine would be around $250-$500. Make sure you dress decently in court and apologize to the court/judge...stay out of trouble!|`|0UV0PwDLaa	Felonies are serious as Sh**. I think they were just trying to scare you, and it looks like it worked. You've learned a lesson though, always check before you go fourwheeling, off roading ect. on any place that isn't your property. <br>  <br>  A judge would have to be meanassed as hell to throw you in jail for that.<br>  <br>  P.S. Putting something in someone Else's mailbox is illegal too, even if they asked you to and they're a family member. These laws are good things for certain situations, but this isn't one of them. I highly doubt anything bad will happen, other than maybe a fine.

In an interview with the Chicago Daily Tribune, Obama said, "I'm a Christian. And so, although I try not to have my religious beliefs dominate or determine my political views on this issue, I do believe that tradition, and my religious beliefs say that marriage is something sanctified between a man and a woman."|`|6Z6qXhPXaa	Because he realizes that the majority of Americans do not support gay marriage.<br>  <br>  No matter what the gay lobby says or what any ultra liberal politician promises; gay marriage ain't gonna happen.

Destroying the US economy is just one more step closer to dependence on them.|`|ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	Obama is working for the financial interests of the world who put him into office with the specific goal of moving this country toward a global socialist government. He is achieving this fairly quickly by using contrived economic and environmental crisis to make controlling changes over the citizens of this country. In short, he's a Neo-Marxist who is playing to forces in this world who are this country's enemies. Problem is, there are many, many Americans who are about done watching this garbage and will take whatever steps necessary to stop this trend.|`|aFC72tLZaa	You're really funny!!  Ya know what else if funny?  I think it would be funny if Bushed lived up to his responsibility and acted like a man.  He started this recession, years ago, in '07, now he's hiding out in his million dollar house!  He should be dragged back to Washington and be forced to repair this country that he has broken!|`|kqLdwe3Iaa	He is working for himself and his little friends.

Interesting insight though.  I've always thought he was working for the lower income class who are always struggling.  I don't know how he can make it better for them. They have to want to make it better for themselves.  School financial aid has always been there.  It's nothing new.  One just has to have the will to study hard enough. Vocational training has always been there. <br>  <br>  The only thing I see him adding that is new is national healthcare.|`|ioogYI2baa	Dude are you serious? What about what he is doing would suggest that he is not working for the country? <br>  <br>  The closing of Gitmo? with the reports of the mistreatment of the (often inncoent) prisoners there, it was a necessary to close to eliminate the reputation of a country that not only tortures, but tortures the innocent. Also, the real terrorists are not being set free, they are merely being sent to trial eventually, so that they can go to their jail cell never to cause trouble to society again.<br>  <br>  The stimulous package? Many economists actually feel that he is not spending enough money on this. The best comparison for this would be the Great Depression, and look how this played out. When FDR spent money, the economy got a little bit better. When he tried to balance the budget afterwards, that's when the economy started to worsen again. Only after we got into the WWII (war= massive amount of industrial, military, and overall government spending) did we get out of the disaster. While I will agree that there was some unneccessary additions to the package, something needed to be done to get this country in order.<br>  <br>  The Stock Market? Investors are concerned because companies will not be able to get free reign on business for awhile. But it was completely unchecked and unregulated free market that lead us into our current financial problem. At least for the time being, we need to make sure that the businesses are being honest so that we can get back on our feet.<br>  <br>  The "lack" of bipartisanship? Clearly not Obama's fault. Obama is trying to nominate GOP people into his cabinet. They are not accepting. He is trying to get Republicans into the decision making process, and again, they refuse. The main problem, and where the real struggle is in Congress. Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi have aliented the Republicans in Congress, practically eliminating there voice at times. For this, I hope that they will be reprimanted by their constituents. There is no excuse for partisan hackery at a time like this. It is time to unite as a country, not fight about petty things.<br>  <br>  While you may not agree with all that Obama is doing, to say that he is not trying his best to do what he feels is right for the United States is just plain ignorant.|`|yJE7INkUaa	yeah, because tax cuts are really going to help the economy.|`|pAYzU2ykaa	No.  He is working for George Soros|`|4Vmlf902aa	He believes he's doing what's right for us. Honestly i'm not going to say anything. Cause we can't assume what he's doing right now is a good, or bad thing for the economy. Just have to wait and see if what he did was the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Obviously the ppl who disagree just watch the propaganda the media throws out, and don't watch the markets. If things are better by say the end of the year (Dow up from current positon, banks lending more,etc.), then we'll know if what he's doing now worked. If they aren't then we can tell that what he's doing now didn't work, and actually made things worse,etc.|`|lEaT5q06aa	putin|`|oVmGcRVtaa	little georgie bush already destroyed the economy.<br>  <br>  If you would like more links, I can provide them.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	He is working for the DNC PERIOD.<br>  <br>  Pelosi is the acting president president, Obama is just the PR guy that is lost without a teleprompter with speeches written by professional writers.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	He's working for change.<br>  <br>  Who needs farmers, truckers or a middle class????<br>  <br>  Only Soup Line Supervisors will be in demand.<br>  <br>  About 3 Million government jobs will be created if you are willing to wear a Greenshirt and carry a gun.|`|mdHqr17kaa	same people his mama and daddy worked for

It isn't working cause that is what we have been doing for the past 8 years & it got us this way.<br>  <br>  They also think people should go get a job instead of collecting unemployment insurance. I live in an area where there are people working. MD home of democratic gov. Martin O'Mally. I don;t know where these reps. live but there are not that many jobs for people in MIssissippi.

These tax cuts need to disproportionately favor the wealthy and big corporations.  It's amazing how they stick to this idea despite the fact that the Bush tax cuts did not stop this recession, so clearly their plan didn't work.<br>  <br>  Republicans have no viable plans to fix the economy other than to let the chips hit the fan.  They have merely become obstinate obstructionists.|`|JinXSnnMaa	I like your attitude so I looked up some of your questions to answer. <br>  <br>  As you know, the republican party is in disarray.

All it does is ensure democrats remain in power for the next several election cycles.|`|yJHJ4Hggaa	awwww, now you want the republicans to fix this. I thought we were going to change this around with the liberal way of spen spend spend. See what reagan did to correct the things Carter did. CUT TAXES. That creates more jobs.

We're onto you.|`|B4wody2Kaa	Actually, the fact Obama is making Rush out to be the GOP leader makes me loose any respect I had for him.|`|2vtP7WS7aa	I am perfectly comfortable with Rush Limbaugh's image. The GOP already has an image of being nothing more than "little democrats."  Sooner or later they will see that he is correct on his points of "rugged individualism" and "capitalism."   As for polling numbers, the majority of the people can vote to jump off the cliff and fly like Superman but it does not change the reality of the situation.  I think the GOP needs fewer "moderates" and more conservatives; not the fakes that the party has been pushing lately.|`|3CSPfJu3aa	Is Rush the issue or the fact that the democrats elected a liar who has broken the most campaign promises in the shortest time and has spent the entire budget in couple pork laden spurts and we still have budget to compile.

Let me give you a scenario of a University student.  What if your political orientation where liberal, but your teacher is George Will. George Will could be a visiting professor who has conservative credentials and intellect all must respect.  You cannot convince or argue your point through the assignments to change his views. You will have to adapt to his view then intellectually earn his respect or you will fail the class.  This same class is required to graduate and this same visiting professor is on your required course offerings to take for the next 2 semesters to earn your second degree. <br>  The presumption that professors go along with which ever way the wind blows is myth. They have deep seated beliefs and a mountain of education to support their point of view. None of them will be pushed and sucker punched by a liberal or conservative. In the classroom setting, they hold the key to your future and they stand in the way of your ambition. <br>  <br>  Liberal arts are important in the global economy. It will take a liberal arts education to apply a successful string of diplomatic victories for the U.S. State Department. A liberal arts education does not teach a liberal politic. It educates you on the Russian political perspective of the world. It presents the religious mosaic of the different types of Muslim beliefs alongside its history in Europe. It introduces the culture of anthropology, the relevance of astronomy and the anatomy of a hungry child in the Sudan. A liberal education means you are shaped to be a more rounded decision maker, instead of a narrow minded one size fits all, I must be right and if you do not agree with me you are not a patriot, mentality.<br>  <br>  After one's college education, the shaping of the person occurs with job assignments and career paths. My point is that we are so much more sophisticated and dynamic than the label of liberal and conservative.  What makes us who we are, how we tick are the life experiences first, later enhanced by our educational pedigree. Where American politics falls short, is that it lacks historical context and perspective in the discussion; only to arrive to "the" solution of what ails the country within the term of the elective office.  The issues could be civil rights, abortion rights, childhood immunizations, early childhood education and many other issues that we all hold dear. The labels cause us to skim the surface and not get to the root of the issues to solve them. <br>  <br>  I leave you with this thought. Think of the decision process and the quality of thought other countries in the world apply to the same issues we pick up and set down every 4 to 8 years due to which brand of politics is in office. Most countries do not have the same time limits and constraints to deal with the issue of abortion or crime. Their is a quiet benefit to have a continuum of leadership on issues that do not fit so neatly within a 4 to 8 year fix. America must deal with the difference of time also, as we consider what is best for our world, it is at this point a liberal education has its place. A higher level of education offers title, but no title trumps the common sense of an open mind.|`|k1W70RHFaa	Don't listen to the idiots who say that the people that can't make it in life simply become professors. <br>  <br>  Most of them wouldn't be able to become professors even if they tried!<br>  <br>  Well, Academia is always going to have a different view on things, simply because they're separated from the population.|`|AA12104896	Open minds<br>  Learning<br>  Science<br>  The arts<br>  Diverse environment with people from all cultures and ideas from many areas<br>  <br>  It's no wonder universities are predominantly liberal.|`|bb2fb83f62e8d0f381f54d42036a5791aa	It's because intelligent people work and attend those places.

The people who lived there left instead working to rebuild wanting every thing handed to them.   Obama formed Acorn for his gain and they get paid but will they lift a finger and go down to New Orleans.  Maybe the Community Organizer from the south side Chicago did not teach his people well and help other through despair and trauma.  Remember the Republicans helped and donated for the hurricane in that area during the convention and Obama did nothing but plan his big production and spend. People from other countries when hit with a disaster get things cleaned up fast and here is New Orleans now at this time still waiting for more handouts while their President Obama lives in luxury and fame.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	LA has a Republican Governor now.

We did not wait for government hand outs, We did not blame George Bush, We took matters in our own hands and were out with chainsaws, and tools and started repairs and rebuilding ourselves. If another Hurricane should hit we will rebuild again.<br>    When Hurricane Ike hit last year we did the same once again, Two major hurricanes later and we have rebuilt from both of them while the New Orleans Katrina crowd is still crying and getting sympathy from everyone else.<br>    Quit feeling sorry for them, they have played the pity card for too long .|`|fnXMF09baa	Bush didn't let N.O. drown.

ZHfR1lPkaa	You have to understand how Obama operates, <br>  First he rubs raw the sores of discontent , then he comes in like prince charming to offer the solution. Your savior has arrived.<br>  <br>  Just listen to the philosophy of his Idols<br>  <br>  Alinsky viewed as supremely important the role of the organizer, or master manipulator, whose guidance was responsible for setting the agendas of the People’s Organization.  "The organizer," Alinsky wrote, "is in a true sense reaching for the highest level for which man can reach -- to create, to be a 'great creator,' to play God."<br>  <br>  One of Obama's early mentors in the Alinsky method was Mike Kruglik, who had this to say to an interviewer of The New Republic, about Obama:<br>  <br>  "He was a natural, the undisputed master of agitation, who could engage a room full of recruiting targets in a rapid-fire Socratic dialogue, nudging them to admit that they were not living up to their own standards.  As with the panhandler, he could be aggressive and confrontational.  With probing, sometimes personal questions, he would pinpoint the source of pain in their lives, tearing down their egos just enough before dangling a carrot of hope that they could make things better."<br>  <br>  After Columbia, Obama spent a year in New York and was then hired by a community organizer for the Developing Communities Project (DCP) of the Calumet Community Religious Conference (CCRC) in Chicago.  The "Project" was funded by Bill Ayers' Woods Fund, which raises the question, "did Obama meet Ayers" while both were students in New York?  They lived and attended school in the same neighborhood. <br>  <br>  Obama was 24 years old, unmarried, and according to his memoir, searching for a genuine African-American community.<br>  <br>  Both the CCRC and the DCP were built on the Alinsky model of community agitation, wherein paid organizers learned how to, in Alinsky's words, "rub raw the sores of discontent."|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Check it out.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	That is exactly why Obama is partially  to blame for the dive in the stock market.

They don't depend on anyone for their income. Most liberals have a belief even though they don't push it on others, that they don't depend on their employer.

We can go to a store or stand for food but the source of our food is the earth & sun. Libertals are so much more together about life than cons. You have no clue. As you are trying to spread fear you actually create more of it in your own life. As you are trying to show you are better than others by presenting this question what you are saying is that you feel so little you need the big people to come down to your level to make you feel Ok about yourself.

Because if you go any further back than that it'd be a pretty empty place). We need immigrants to work and reduce the economic impacts our ageing population would otherwise have. The BNP obviously don't get this. Oh yeah, and I've read their racist garbage, and it makes me sick, so they would be even further down my list than Labour.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and no, they didn't say that Labour was insignificant when it began - the Liberals felt rather threatened by it, because they feared it would take away many of its working class voters, which in the end it did. It most certianly was not viewed as insignificant, because it had the support of most of the UK's big trade unions - support on a scale your BNP couldn't even dream of. Don't make such presumptuous statements when you don't have a clue what you're on about.
Uaci5YXWaa	Win and Lose are relative terms, subject to opinion and spin.<br>  <br>  Bush wanted to bolster his policy in Afghanistan by saying that his administration was doing a good job - Obama wanted to criticize Republican policies by saying that they were not doing a good job.  Obama also wants to make a case for what he wants to do, which is to take troops out of Iraq and put them into Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  I personally think that Afghanistan is even more of a black hole than Iraq and the sooner we get out, the better off we, and the rest of the world will be.  I do not see Afghanistan as 'winable.'  The British tried and failed.  The Russians tried and failed. We will try and fail.  Sorry - but there it is.  <br>  <br>  Aiding Pakistan might be worthwhile, but India and China would be far more valuable allies.  There are a number of African countries that are more worthy of assistance, far more needy and far more 'winable.'  But they don't figure into our geo-political strategy at the moment.  <br>  <br>  I do not know who figures these things out, but it is obviously not the military nor a team of qualified political scientists.  Europe has been providing troops, but I think they are just along for the ride.  What we need is an international body that decides when a country has gone rogue and provides international troops to occupy it until it gets its act together.

vYNOotEMaa	It is correct that every culture defines marriage.  <br>  But,  definitions change over time, due to evolution of laws.<br>  <br>  For example, women today are no longer considered the property of their husbands. Back in early 20th century, women didn't even have custody of their children. <br>  Once, if a woman wanted to get a divorce, they were considered both a "bad" wife, and bad mother.  They'd lose custody of their children.<br>  <br>  Children too have gained rights over the years, parents no longer can abuse, beat up their children.  <br>  <br>  But let me warn those who wish to return to the "good ole days" when women were property, and  men could sow their wild oats, and even have mistresses and concubines. (medical authorities once said sex was good for men, but not for women)<br>  <br>  Old time wisdom said marriage civilized men, but also women who enjoyed their sexuality were deviants or lewd, sluts, or otherwise misfits.  Haven't we moved beyound this notion?  And, isn't LOVE the modern reason for marriage, not convenience, nor for sake of property rights?<br>  <br>  I'm with Top Congributor Angela Q on this one.<br>  <br>  Looking backwards toward old  definitions of marriage, the way ancient Jewish culture defined it, is really stupid.  We've learned so much since then.<br>  <br>  When a woman's husband died, tradition used to require that she must marry her brother-in-law, for example.  <br>  That's what happened with their definition of marriage. (and keeping a widow part of the family).  The Biblical definitions are no longer reasonable, IMO.<br>  <br>  But, I could be flexible.  I'm ready for polygamy/polyamory, or expanded families again.<br>  There was some good male logic in those Big Love ideas.<br>  But, better logic today, is equality for all, whether homosexual, or heterosexual.<br>  Justice for All !|`|WCkOUF9aaa	ALL of the developed countries?

The federal government deported immigrants for being "perverts" and even the US Supreme Court said, in 1967, that the word "perverts" includes homosexuals. Gay people who had jobs as public school teachers were fired from the jobs and the courts upheld those terminations as being legal. And the US military still does not want gay people in it and will still discharge any service-person who reveals that they are gay. "Sodomy" was still a crime in 13 states until about 5 1/2 years ago.<br>  <br>  As of 114 years ago, the British legal put playwright Oscar Wilde in jail for two years for having consensual sex with men. British filmmakers made a movie about that event in 1960 and throughout that movie almost every single character talked about homosexuality as if they believed it was "immoral," "degenerate," "loathsome," "appalling," "filthy," and so on.|`|e68ed70654e71ea7f425cc92736a0d51aa	The term was not redefined, it was hijacked, A difference.<br>  <br>  Get government out of marriage.<br>  <br>  Allow government to handle the legal side (civil union), that is what a marriage is legally.<br>  <br>  Allow religion to handle the religious side (marriage).

Also since they dont have that it means they have to focus their search. basically it means that they are using reasonable suspicion to focus their search something that may happen relatively soon in the United States if something bad enough were to happen. Also to the one who says its in the constitution for these rights technically its in the bill of rights which were added slightly after the constitution.|`|0eFSeap5aa	That quote is from a document that formed the basis of the country that formerly occupied the land now occupied by the current country.

4xN3ZIhYaa	i was a republican in high school, but BOTH parties seem to have gotten hijacked.  Ron Paul is one of the last decent elected officials in washington.<br>  <br>  what he says is not even that crazy, its truth and common sense.|`|5Ho518J9aa	For me, it was the Fox News Primary debates. He was obviously the only one who wasn't reading from rehearsed answers to rehearsed questions. He was hit with that unbelieveably inappropriate "credibility" question, and he knocked it out of the park, as if it were batting practice. He was the only man on stage not wearing caked-on stage makeup or self tanning-lotion. He's just a old fashioned country doctor, who's birthed well in excess of 4,000 babies, in addition to a stellar career in Congress, to my knowlege never having taken a bribe. He didn't get my vote, sorry to say, because I was sure that he had no chance of being elected. I still kick myself, for not going with my core principles.|`|AA11702773	Too close to the California primaries to do much good other than vote for him.

But I looked into him and then bought his book the revolution and that was it for me. I was sold.

I never would have guessed. Maybe there are other people like that which haven't gotten to the point you are at yet.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	Around August of '07. You know, I thought Obama was for real change, but after doing extensive research on not just Obama, but Hillary, McCain, and the rest of the a** kissers, I found Ron Paul as the only guy left to research on. I thought he was pretty radical, but after watching him on YouTube, the GOP debates, his speeches, reading his 20 year old weekly newsletters, and on interviews, this guy was the only one who wanted the change I wanted. I was always online for every money bomb, I was always spreading the message that was very identical to the founders, he also inspired me to read the economic viewpoints of Jefferson, the advice of non-interventionism, bigger government, and so on. Ron Paul cured my apathy, enough said.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	When it dawned on me that Bush and Obama are both globalist puppets.  The Clintons too, and the rest of the gang in Congress.  I heard Ron Paul in the primaries, then started researching.  The more I found out, the more convinced I became that he was the only one who did not have the globalist agenda, and the rest of them are only pawns in a 'game' that will end up being the de-sovereignization of the US.  I consider Ron Paul one of the true patriots in government today.  I don't necessarily agree with everything he says, but at least he's honest.|`|1KcQbEopaa	In the primaries.  I thought some of his ideas were a little radical - meaning alot of politicians would not support him.  Especially about dismantling some long standing government organizations but I agreed with a good amount of what he stood for.  I can't turn back time so talking about it now does it matter?  As a tear drizzles down my face.  Sigh.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	Last year, when I kept making fun of Ron Paul's "kookiness" here on Y! Answers before I knew about him.  I kept getting a bunch of thumbs down, so I started looking into him.  Turns out I was wrong about him.  *cough*|`|bYdNXLVgaa	1st Primary Rep Debate.|`|Y7RbTYNvaa	Very recently, just in the past few months.  I used to be an avid liberal democrat, but I became disgusted with the democrats in this last election -- and I am even more disgusted with them now that I see how intent they are to continue these irresponsible fiscal policies.  Like "A Republicrat", I used to think Ron Paul was a kook.  However, over the holidays in December I was visiting family and came across Ron Paul's book "The Revolution" on a bookshelf.  I picked up the book, started reading it, and couldn't put it down.  I realized this man wasn't a kook at all; in fact, he was able to verbalize exactly what is wrong with our current government.  That was "all she wrote" as they say.  I realized that, in fact, I agreed with much of what he said -- and that he is the only politician willing to speak the TRUTH!  Since then, and since I have looked into Dr Paul more thoroughly, I have become a supporter -- even more so now that it has become more than apparent that our government is ineffectual and incompetent as it is now.
49491d4026350f4de724cb49c3744085aa	some questions are so insanely st*pid, they simply cry out for a smart*ss remark in response(yes, i am guilty).  others on here post some very thought provoking questions.  i admit that i am far more politically minded than, say, 20 years ago.  i have children now.  i pay taxes.  i can see how the decisions of politicians affect my life, as well as the lives of my children in their futures.  so, in that sense, i do think politics is important.|`|4569b23a3611fb03850cd42c9f2cb6baaa	I give it a lot of thought but I say exactly what's on my mind.  <br>  That's why so many liberal democrats give me thumbs down.  <br>  I'm 70 years old I was born just after the great depression.  I've lived through several wars and this is the first time I have ever thought this is no longer about just the economy being bad all over the world.  It brings to mind something that plays over and over in my mind. If you are wondering why this is associated with a question about politics the world seems headed for bankruptcy and what better time for this to occur.  When no one has a job, no one can pay taxes and NO ONE has money.  It looks like perfect timing.<br>  Mark of the Beast<br>  Rev.13:15-<br>   And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that ***no man might buy or sell,*** save he that had the mark***, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name...and his number is Six hundred & sixty-six.<br>  <br>  Revelation 13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear. <br>   Bible Scholars interpret it like this<br>  The Antichrist will **rise to power on a wave of world euphoria,** as he temporarily saves the world from its desperate economic, military & political problems*** with a brilliant 7-year plan for world peace, economic stability & religious freedom.

But I tend to think about each question deeply.  Politics is very important because political decisions affect the lives of every one of us.  To those who would say the ordinary voter is not important, remember that collectively your votes can overturn governments and install new ones.  The Government is quite happy to let people believe they don't count, and to let the PC brigade do the thinking for them.<br>  <br>  Edit: Why do Americans only seem to write one or two lines?|`|Msd9PiRGaa	I really did try to give these thoughtful, well written answers for a long time, and back in the day there were at least a few good people who you could talk to and have intelligent and civil conversations about politics, but then these pricks just took it over, and I have to say, dragged me down a bit.

The judge has discretion to impose a sentence, suspend it and have it all be dismissed if you stay out of trouble for say one year.  Sometimes they'll want you to do community service or something.  Tell the judge you will agree to whatever he suggests if the matter is dismissed upon compliance.  By the way, if they thought they could prove intent... it's charged as burglary, not petty theft.

Another great person in the eyes of the democrats.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	I am a lifelong, hardcore liberal and I don't like it.<br>  <br>  Some of those people bought houses that they thought they would be able to afford, and then lost their jobs.<br>  Some of them were scammed by corrupt bank officials.<br>  And some of them knew they couldn't afford the houses and are just plain greedy.<br>  <br>  Whatever the reason, if you can't afford the house, then you shouldn't be in it.<br>  <br>  People can sell the expensive houses and move to a house that they can afford.<br>  If the expensive house doesn't sell relatively quickly, there can be holds placed on the mortgage, but the terms of the mortgage should not be changed UNLESS it's proven that the bank committed fraud.<br>  <br>  It's just a house.<br>  It's not your life.|`|W3NY2E5daa	I know you asked for responses from Democrats but as a Republican I wanted to add my 2 cents on this issue. From what I understand if you have mortgages for multiple homes and file for bankruptcy the current rules only allow the judge to make changes to the interest rates on the other mortgages but not the mortgage for the primary home. Why allow the others to be changed but not the home that the person lives in?<br>  <br>  As far as the possibility that then might cause more people to file for bankruptcy if they already in serious hurt then they would mostly likely file anyhow. <br>  <br>  My main concern in regards to allowing the judge to have more power to make changes to the mortgage is how much power will they be given? When I first heard about this issue the change that was talked about was to only let the judge lower the interest rate. But lately I have heard comments by a few Democratic leaders that this would allow the judge to even change the amount of the loan in cases where the home owner owed more then the current value of the home. To that I have to say BS. I think the judge should be allowed to lower the interest rate for a short time to give the home owner long enough to recover and that's it. But to let the judge lower the amount owed on the loan penalizing the bank in the process is too much power, That would lead to banks charging more to those who make their payments. <br>  <br>  So right now the big question is what changes will be made and how much power will be given to the judges in the process?|`|AA10757358	Adam B sorry but you do not have any idea why the banks have failed.  I will tell you why.  The Democrats made the banks loan money to low income people to buy homes.  The banks knew the people would not and could not pay off the loans but they were forced to loan them the money anyway.  The Fannie Mai and Freddie Mac bonds were issued so that the low income people could buy homes.  Investors invested in these bonds thinking they were good bonds since they were Federal Insured bonds.   It was not the banks fault that they got in trouble it was the fault of the Democratic Congress.  Bush tried to tell them that the banks would go under if they continued to make them loan money to people that couldn't pay their loans but the Democrats would not listen.   I think the more the government gets involved in the economy the worse our economy gets that includes the change in mortgage rates.|`|08DvCtbUaa	First, I don’t see how it will make responsible people rates increase seeing that most people have “fixed” rates.  Second, I don’t know if you own a home, but I do and every time one of my neighbors goes into foreclosure my home value plummets.  Finally, most people don’t want to file for bankruptcy because it ruins your credit and is very expensive. <br>  <br>  What do you suggest they do?|`|3YRrGfkiaa	So you are proposing that people should go homeless ... for what?  To preserve bank profits?  The same banks that have wasted how many millions of OUR dollars?<br>  <br>  And how will anyone's mortgage rates skyrocket?

As I understand it, one of the provisions will return a percentage of any profit, if/when the property is sold, to the mortgage lender. That way, the pain AND the profit are spread around.

Not on people who have homes but on those trying to buy homes. <br>  <br>  It will turn into the same scenario as credit card rates. The rates are so high because it is so easy to claim bankruptcy and clear your debt, also because of debt consolidation. Credit card companies lose tons of money because of it. They adjust the rate of responsible people to make up the difference. Do you think that mortgage companies and lenders will just eat the cost? Of course not, they will do the same thing and raise interest rates to make up for the losses.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	I like it.  It simply allows the interest rate to be reduced.

It will simply help those that are struggling with interest rates that are too high.|`|kH0IxFa9aa	This is good.<br>  I'll be recommending this to my clients.<br>  Reason: What others feel falsely that they are paying someone Else's mortgage" isn't true.<br>  <br>  There are people that had income. Lost their income or are working less hours because of lay offs. These folks could originally afford their homes. They were in some cases on their jobs for over 20 years!<br>  What people are thinking, that some people bought "Big huge homes" out of their budget. These home buyers could once afford their "Dream Homes".<br>  Sure there were speculators etc.<br>  <br>  I really feel that there are folks out there that are "sour grapes" because they have a shabby house that they are working two jobs to pay for and resent the one's that once could afford their house.<br>  <br>  These people purchased their homes at a 3% rate, then it increased to 6%, then to 9%, then to 13%...lost their job!<br>  If it takes them filing bankruptcy, more power to them. Their credit in some instants, is screwed anyway.<br>  This should put the condescending mortgage companies back into their place.<br>  I think 13% interest is outrages! No home buyer saw any of this coming. It is not their fault. ARM's are nothing to fool around with, even in the best of times.<br>  <br>  <br>  The only solution I see is for the distressed home buyer is to stand at the courthouse steps with a cashier's check and purchased the over market value home for half the price!<br>  Or if all else fails. Have someone else in good credit standing (straw buyer) to help them get the home back at the courthouse steps.<br>  <br>  There were a lot of sneaky under handed loan officers/brokers/lenders out there. I saw them in action.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	I was a Builder thru the 70's and 80's. I know that there were no programs available that a borrower could get a loan without qualifying with proven income and credit. In fact, the qualifying ratio was a mortgage payment, principal, interest, taxes and insurance (PITI) not exceeding 28% of gross income...period.  I believe the new bankruptcy law will return qualifying as a prerequisite to a loan.

Government involvement as a whole over the past decades have been increasing from Carter to Obama.

We the people are not represented equally and if the government keeps trying to make every one happy, then that is wrong, only the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed. All else is up to the individual citizen, a word called autonomy sums it up pretty well, thank you.

mdHqr17kaa	While the words "Separation of Church and State" DO appear in the constitution of the former Soviet Union, they do NOT appear in the US Constitution. <br>  <br>  Here is what the First Amendment to the US Constitution actually does say.<br>  <br>  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So where did the words "Separation of Church and State." come from? They can be traced back to a letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote back in 1802. <br>  <br>  In October 1801, the Danbury Baptist Association of Connecticut wrote to President Jefferson, and in their letter they voiced some concerns about Religious Freedom. On January 1, 1802 Jefferson wrote a letter to them in which he added the phrase "Separation of Church and State." <br>  <br>  When you read the full letter, you will understand that Jefferson was simply underscoring the First Amendment as a guardian of the peoples religious freedom from government interference. Here is an excerpt:<br>  <br>      "I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between church and State." <br>  <br>  Jefferson simply quotes the First Amendment then uses a metaphor, the "wall", to separate the government from interfering with religious practice. <br>  <br>  Notice that the First Amendment puts Restrictions only on the government, not the people! <br>  <br>  The Warren Court re-interpreted the First Amendment thus putting the restrictions on the people. <br>  <br>  When Thomas Jefferson wrote his letter to the Danbury Baptist Association he never intended the words "Separation of Church and State" to be taken out of context and used as a substitute for the First Amendment, but for all practical purposes is what the courts have done.<br>  <br>  If actions speak stronger then words, it is interesting to note that 3 days after Jefferson wrote those words, he attended church in the largest congregation in North America at the time. This church held its weekly worship services on government property, in the House Chambers of the U.S. Capital Building. The wall of separation applies everywhere in the country even on government property , without government interference. This is how it is written in the Constitution, this is how Thomas Jefferson understood it from his letter and actions, and this is how the men who wrote the Constitution practiced it.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are two parts to the First Amendment that refer to religion: the establishment clause and the free exercise clause.

Under our Constitution, everyone is equal under the law and everyone has the right to get married. period. i don't see why gay people should be an exception to these laws or the basic rights we are supposed to have as americans. If you don't believe in gay marriage, then don't marry another man. We have no right to control other peoples lives just because we don't agree with it. We cant control who other people have sex with, or who other people love, nor do we have to the right to. Also, if marriage was the same as it was  hundreds of years ago, women would have no choice who they had to marry, you would be able to get married at 12 years old to a man who was 3 times your age, and it would be perfperfectlyeptable to beat or cheat on your wife but your wife wouldn't be aloud to speak out against it or leave you. Marriage is completely different than it was centuries ago because we have come to realize that all people are equal. I would also like to say that Churches do not have to allow gay marriage nor does it have to be reconized by the Church but deneying people the right to marry who they love just because he/she is the same sex as you are completly goes against seperation of church and state.|`|klj3cOFPaa	Before the 12th Century, Christianity recognized same-sex marriages.

CjpLFJgVaa	I am against any abortion, be it partial birth or even early in the term.  It's sick and murdering an innocent baby that has no voice for itself, and we do it all in the name of convenience.  This is why I refuse to vote for ANY candidate who would support ANY form of abortion, because I believe that I will have to go before God some day and give an account for my life, and I want to be able to say that I did EVERYTHING I could to support life, and the rights of the unborn.<br>  <br>  BTW Stephen, as a father of 3 kids, going to the Dr. appointments with my wife and hearing my kids heart beats inside the womb, and on the ultrasound, seeing them moving and seeing their hearts beating, I'd love for you to explain to me HOW that is just a mass of tissue.  If there's a heart beat, it's a LIVING being.<br>  <br>  Grow up, if anyone is being brainwashed in this country, it's the liberals who buy into the garbage that the liberal "thinkers" & leaders spew.<br>  <br>  It's been proven that women who have had abortions, suffer physical and psychological damage.  Feeling regret & remorse, depression after realizing that they killed their baby.  The physical damage that's done to a woman's uterus after an abortion, leaving scar tissue.  Women who have abortions run a higher risk of miscarriages later when they are trying to have children.  It has been medically proven.<br>  <br>  But the pro-abortion movement doesn't want those facts to be heard, because if they were, I believe that states would outlaw abortion.<br>  <br>  People that child growing in the womb, is a precious being, and a blessing, even if it's not wanted.  That child did NOTHING to deserve being murdered.|`|W9IgwU4Paa	Very sick indeed.  But remember a liberal's argument "It's a FETUS!"|`|78z7gk7naa	I love how you try to make people agree with you by making them disgusted.<br>  Hey are you vegetarian? If you aren't, let me show you what they do to the animals so you'll believe what I believe!<br>  <br>  <br>  Get my point? In the end, people will believe what they want. You should realize this. So let me guess, If I say I'm still prochoice in your eyes I'm a murderer? Well in my eyes, if you eat meat your a murderer too!  Cool, am I right?<br>  <br>  ----<br>  Reply: I don't get how I'm making this a religious debate, I never said anything about religion. Did I? And I'm not liberal, sorry. Don't go jumping toward conclusions. I'm not a democrat.<br>  <br>  Thats fine you think that, but I believe if people view abortion wrong then killing animals for meat should be wrong. This is my belief, and sorry if I ever seemed like Im pushing any of my beliefs on you. You can believe what you want, but this is my view.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  I never had a abortion, I think they are personally nasty but I am still prochoice. I never said I cared more about cows more than people, I'm just saying if people think Abortion is wrong because your killing a innocent life shouldnt eating meat be wrong because your eating a innocent life.<br>  <br>  By killing a cow, I meant the meat industry. Sorry If I wasnt clear.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Animals are not people, but we are animals. And I dont think a animal has the same rights as people, though I wish they were treated better.  But anways, this is off topic. I'd rather talk about the discussion at hand, not animal cruelty.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  I'm not trying to turn this into a religious debate, no where in this have I talked about religion.<br>  <br>  I think abortion is personally gross but I do believe if the woman chooses to have one its her choice, and I have no right to judge her. Would I have a abortion? No. Would I care if someone else had one? No.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  @Michelle is a man:<br>  Thats very immature, you know that? Calling me a murderer just for saying what I believe? How am I brainless? I do value life, but I value personal choice as well. If you disagree with me, thats fine, but is insulting me really necessary?|`|XsI7ISqsaa	im pro choice. whilst it sounds pretty sick hardly any are performed and theyre mostly performed due to the mothers life being in danger. really if you outlaw one practice its a slippery slope. your attempts at trying to get people to gross out is pretty pathetic however. the majority of people are pro choice and you pro birthers wont change that. youre the minority and rightfully so.<br>  <br>  god put animals on the earth for us to eat lol. how ignorant. theres plenty of animals we cant eat. what are they for? your imaginary friend didnt put animals anywhere|`|enbEdn8iaa	These people are sick. It's OK for them to murder babies but if someone breaks into my home and I splash that persons brains all over my walls with one of my legally owned shotguns I am a murderer. <br>  These liberals need to be put out of their misery. It's disgusting, complete filth. Not only is this administration promoting this behavior, they're taking money out of doctors pockets if the doctor has morals and refuses to perform murder!<br>  I honestly hope that more nutcases like the "lambs of Christ" and James Charles Kopp begin to bomb planned parenthood and execute abortion "doctors".  Nothing brings me satisfaction more then a good planned parenthood bombing. I'm an atheist, so it's not really hypocritical to wish death on bad people. It's not like I'm contradicting my religion. <br>  It is a huge scam that the liberals pair this with "womans rights". Who would argue against the rights of a woman? It is a separate issue all together. It is NOT the same. Woman have plenty of choices regarding birth control, usually free of charge no matter what income. When one of these losers uses abortion as a form a birth control they are mudering their child, plain and simple. The mental damage done to these woman is incredible; most can never function again as a normal person and are at the mercy of social programs for the remainder of their lives. I really believe that liberals do not value life, at all. I think they are shallow, pompous, self rightous people who can not put themselves in someone else's place. They are sociopaths, and their mental illness is liberalism.<br>  <br>  You know you're going to lose your email account because Yahoo promotes such barbaric acts?|`|uZ0NOD8zaa	Yes, I believe that the people should have a choice. It would be utterly sick if it can feel the pain and can think but they can't . <br>  <br>  If people don't care about how animals are slaughtered for meat and can feel every bit of pain there is, then it's not even comparable.<br>  <br>  Stephen, that is partially true. It's the premature form of a baby but it has just as much life as a piece of skin.<br>  <br>  Full grown cows can think and feel pain, that is the difference. Do you know how the pain they feel? How would you be liked to be slaughtered for food?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Animals has just as much as life as a full grown baby. We're technically mammal animals.<br>  <br>  Animals eat others too, it's the food cycle. I'm just trying to make a point. You tell the animals that God put them on Earth to be aten. There are plenty other sources of protein by the way|`|yJE7INkUaa	Seeing as that isnt illgeal i dont think it really matters. <br>  As far as abortion goes, i think once the baby does not have the depend of the body of their mother, it should not be leagle. I think women should be able to do whatever they want to their bodies, but once the baby is able to live on it own, it is no longer part of your body. Plus at that point its just stupid, you might as well adopt. <br>  <br>  I am Pro Choice, only for the reason that i dont think i have the right to control other peoples lives. I dont think i would ever have an abortion, unless i was in a situation where it would risk my health or the baby's heath for me to carry it. But i dont have the right to stop other people from doing what they want to do to their body's <br>  <br>  As far as this who animal thing that is going on, i myself am not a vegetarian, mostly because i dont have the self control and like the taste of meat to much, but i complelty understand why people are vegetarins. I dont think animals are here for us to eat them. But we are part of the food chain i guess.|`|bmCInR5qaa	There is no such medical procedure.

Late term abortions of any kind are actually quite rare and are performed usually only in cases of medical emergency.  No woman carries a baby for 8 months and then just decides, on a whim, to get an abortion.<br>  <br>  2.  'Partial Birth Abortion' isn't even the procedure's real name, it is just a name politicians made up to make it sound worse than it is.  So they could get your vote and your donations. <br>  <br>  3.  There is an alternate procedure for late term abortion but you never hear about it because it doesn't have a scary made-up name.  In this procedure the woman's cervix is dilated and stretched out, and the surgeon puts a scissors up there and cuts the fetus up into pieces and pulls them out.  Then the tiny undeveloped body is then re-assembled on the table to make sure they got it all.  Do you like that better?<br>  <br>  4.  Under President Clinton's administration, abortions of all kinds were reduced by a significant amount--more than a third as I remember.  This was because he allowed young kids to get birth control and information to keep from getting pregnant in the first place.  Under Bush the abortion rate rose again to what it had been before.<br>  <br>  5.  Nobody is 100% pro-life or pro-choice.  About 90% of people allow that there are some times an abortion is acceptable.<br>  <br>  6.  The Republicans have exploited the abortion issue for about 30 years now.  No less than seven Supreme Court appointments have been made by Reagan and the two Bushes, and each of these was promised to be the single 'swing vote' needed to overturn Roe v. Wade.  But it's never come up.  Because the Republican don't want to lose an issue.  They want to milk the issue for its maximum political benefit.  They've been stringing you along all this time. Don't you feel like a tool?<br>  <br>  7.  Your side has had 30 years to try to persuade Americans that abortion is wrong.  No success so far.  Americans in general feel the same way about it as they did in the late 70s.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	Any so called doctor that is practicing this is carrying on the work of Dr. Joseph Mengele.

(To this logic, I say Bull Sh*t)!<br>  A win for the democrats was a drastic defeat for unborn children.God Help Us All because we have to pay taxes to aid in this sick procedure which makes us contributors to the act and God has? warned everyone that His Wrath will befall anyone who harms one of-His little ones.? Pray as you have never prayed before, hope only it will be enough for Him to forgive us!?   If you don't believe God does exist, that is up to you, I prefer to play it safe!|`|c3vPZfghaa	You forgot to mention that this type of abortion aren't utilized in the USA as a form of birth control.<br>  You also forgot to mention that they are an emergency procedure only in the USA.<br>  You also forgot ot mention they only make up abot 0.05% of all abortions in the USA.<br>  You also forgot to mention that most times it is performed it is performed to save the mother's life.<br>  You also forgot to mention that most cases it is performed in the USA, the pregnancy would not have resulted in a viable human being had it not been performed.<br>  <br>  If you are going to cry about an idealistic view, you should at least give people all the facts, so they can see how totally unreasonable your views are.<br>  <br>  By the way, you also forgot to mention that is actually the procedure to remove a fetus with hydrocephalus, a condition that can't be detected until late in the pregnancy, rather than an actual abortion.<br>  <br>  But don't worry as soon as we start utlizing genetics more in the medical field, something you right-wingers are also opposed to, those types of procedures will become obsolete.

A child of 13 or 14 may be considered by the court to have reached a sufficient age to make an intelligent choice about with whom he/she prefers to live. However, while a child's preference is carefully considered by the judge, it is in no way binding by the court.<br>  <br>  I have provided a site as an example to refer to...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.masslawhelp.com/lawhelp/legal_info/?sw=3124&full_id=209" rel="nofollow">http://www.masslawhelp.com/lawhelp/legal...</a>|`|qOG7AoZwaa	ok the children have no say.  the decision must be a mutual agreement between parents or presiding judge.

FpioJ7F5aa	Amnesty is not proposed by anyone except the illegal aliens and the people who are desperately working to make the political presence of the illegal aliens a force in today's politics.  It would appear at least some of the money supporting that effort has fallen away, and I believe all of us are hoping the American Government will support the American People, and not the illegal aliens and the lobby groups of Washington D.C with the consequence that there won't be an amnesty.  And almost certainly... there will not be an amnesty.<br>  <br>  If you are an illegal alien working a job, it is simply a matter of time before you have to come up with a certified birth certificate.  You may be able to do that through criminal contacts, but when you are discovered, and you will be discovered, your violations of American Law will then have reached a very ugly place.  I would put you in jail if you stole a birth certificate to obtain a false presence in the United States.<br>  <br>  Understand something.  The United States Government has not suggested...  at any point... that amnesty be provided to anyone.  Small groups have been demanding that amnesty, and that message was trumpeted by the Spanish Language Broadcaster in the United States.  They have hurt a lot of people in doing that, but the support for that idea was the only in the criminal elements of this country we call illegal aliens.

Many reasons: His inability to give a straight answer to calm investors, his proposal to tax working Americans to the poor house, his appointment of tax cheats, his lavish White House partying (almost every night) with $100-per-pound Japanese steak, his disrespectful treatment of the visiting British Prime Minister last week, his lack of knowledge of economic principles (whenever he goes "off the teleprompter," he uses incorrect terms), his "porkulus" bill, his socialist agenda, his inexperience, his empty rhetoric.

a66nvk0taa	So your going straight to central Europe etc. So how you going to get work there? Did you get an offer of a job there? the only way you get a job there is: If you you have dual citizenship with one of these countries, or an employer offered you a job there. In which they couldn't get anyone to fulfill the position within the 27 EU countries. That employer would have to apply to government department to get permission to employ someone from outside the EU. The position would have to be advertised all in 27 EU countries before he/she take someone from outside the EU. Since you have an EU passport good luck. Just make sure you learn the language of the country you want to live in. Lack of language can go against you applying for a job.

I'm hoping you are keeping an eye on your statute of limitations.  Inconvenient now, but find another lawyer and write a letter relieving current counsel.  Then go to the office and pick up your file.  It's your right and a new lawyer will need to see it.  The only problem is that most PI attorneys who work on contingency don't like when they lose a file they have worked on.  They usually put a "lien" on any settlement received to compensate them for work done.  If your new lawyer is attentive and competent he should be able to argue some of the amount your current lawyer feels he is due, due to current lawyers lack of competent representation  Regardless, find a new lawyer sooner rather than later.|`|AA11376640	You don't have to settle, do not sign anything, call the attorney and tell them they are fired, then put it in writing. If 300k isn't enough don't settle, the same thing happened to me, I chose nothing as a matter of principal. I did file a complaint within the 2 year statute, so I can go back any time to attempt to settle the matter. I feel for the guy that caused my injuries if I run into him in this lifetime, I will settle for an eye for an eye, or cash! The attorney may not have filed a complaint in hopes of settling, if the statute of limitations runs out, you are out of luck and barred forever from filing suit.
JKbvnwcDaa	First off, there is noway that you would ever know what religion he is. And second of all, it is not a requirement, but only a Christian would ever get elected. A nation of 330 million Christians would not let a Muslim be their leader. That is why somebody from a different religion would have to lie about it.|`|rVbY5qBsaa	You're 100% right.

Obama is NOT a Christian. According to his AUTObiography, he has embraced a secular movement based on Black Supremacy and Marxism, thinly veiled in Christian words and selling itself as a church.<br>  We of course realize it is NOT a requirement for a president to be Christian.

9rhmeb7raa	Quite right. And under Reagan revenues to the Treasury tripled. Those who say he rang up massive deficits have little understanding of the Federal spending process. The President can't spend one more dime than the Congress authorizes.|`|fLMCOSWdaa	You are so wrong.  Kennedy and Reagan both ran up massive deficits, but because the money went to the arms companies instead of the needy, none of the conservatives cared.  If you cut taxes in time of recession, all that happens is people sit on it for a rainy day.  The multiplier effect does not kick in.  You have a short memory.  I can recall us licking our lips over here, and looking for a piece of the American action once Reagan got going.  The Laffer effect is a myth.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	Those were different times.

We don't make anything in this country anymore and our infrastructure is failing - roads and power grid.  From Reagan to Bush - they stole everything. <br>  <br>  It's going to take a lot of change.|`|Cs7NbRHzaa	No it didn't. Clinton raised taxes. Bush cut taxes.<br>  <br>  Reagan cut taxes and unemployment drop to 10.8%.<br>  <br>  And taxes were high during Kennedy.|`|IasHMWM2aa	So has Obama, for the middle and working class. Clinton also cut taxes on the middle class.<br>  <br>  Our president Bush cut taxes for the wealthy twice, during a time of war, and it hurt the economy. Why he did that I will never know. I didn't need those tax cuts then or now, and you?|`|YupMCYHlaa	Coolidge came in after WWI, in a booming post-war economy.  He had balanced budgets.  The economy was expanding so rapidly (not because of anything he did) he was able to cut taxes.  He didn't realize a stock market bubble was forming that would pop almost as soon as he left office.<br>  <br>  Kennedy also came along in a time of great post-war prosperity, when every other industrial nation was rebuilding their industrial capacity, which had been destroyed in the war.  He only lowered marginal tax rates from 90% to 70%.  He could do that because it was a good time.<br>  <br>  Reagan is the most interesting, and I think the best example.  Reagan cut taxes only a little.  He lowered marginal rates for the rich but most working people actually ended up paying more than before, because he raised FICA contributions.  I ended up paying about $10 more a week.  Reagan had promised that FICA contributions would go into a 'lock box' for Social Security, but it ended up not working that way.  It became just another contribution to the general fund.<br>  <br>  At the same time, Reagan hugely boosted government spending.  He signed every single spending bill that came across his desk, with a big smile on his face.  He doubled the entire pre-existing national debt in a single term, insisting all the time that revenues would grow to cover it, which they never did.<br>  <br>  It was this deficit spending that boosted the economy, not the tax cuts so much.  The problem is that any president has an incentive to incur huge debt to boost the economy.  He can take credit for the gains in the economy, but when the bill comes due for the debt, he'll be out of office and it will be some other president's problem.<br>  <br>  Spending a trillion we don't have is exactly Reagan's way of getting the economy going!  If it worked for Reagan, why couldn't it work for Obama? At least Obama is not throwing it away on weapons systems we don't need or can't use, or on Star Wars that every expert says won't work.  He's hiring people who need jobs and getting them to do things we needed done anyway.

Even Bush did better.  It sure seems like trickle down economics to me.  Let's review: 1 Put money into a few hands at the top ;  2  in theory, the money trickles down into the rest of the economy.

62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	research says the Canadian Food inpection agency
6OLiuM9Gaa	I enlisted in the Navy about 50 years ago and retired after a quarter of a century. And, from that limited exposure, I'd offer this advice.<br>  <br>  You said you're not overweight. From that I'm presuming you're just concerned about strength and tone.<br>  <br>  (1) It really doesn't take a whole lot more than not being a couch potato. Unless you're going the SEAL track, you should be able to make it. A lot of kids who were in pretty terrible shape have made it.<br>  <br>  (2) The Navy, in general, isn't much involved in open combat. So they don't stress things like forced marches 20 miles with a full pack, carrying a buddy through an obstacle course, that kind of intense physical stuff. In spite of my better judgment, a recruiter friend of mine assures me that the Navy's more technical than combative. <br>  <br>  (3)  Don't burn out. If you just started, don't try to do it all at once. If you haven't worked out for a few months... or a few years... it's going to take some getting used to. <br>  <br>  Really, if you can handle that kind of workout cold on the first day, you shouldn't have any problems in Boot Camp.<br>  <br>  (4) If you're worried, swim a 500, run (not jog) a 500, swim a 500 and run a 500, get up to about 50 or so push-ups, 50 sit-ups, and about 20 pull-ups.  So much for endurance and fast recovery. Ok, start with a 5 by 200 (run 200, swim 200, run 200, swim 200, run 200) That's only 1000 yards, but if you're out of shape, and you push the runs and swims, you're going to be exhausted. ;-)<br>  <br>  If you want to build bulk -- add muscle, you're going to have to do weights. Two ways to go. LOTS of reps with low weights, or several shorter sets with heavier weights. The latter will build and define. The former will tone and strengthen.<br>  <br>  I'm about 70, and I still swim two to five miles a day, run about 15 a week (depending on the weather), do about an hour of cardio three days a week, an hour of weights three days a week, I work out with a Kali instructor two-three days a week. But I'm retired... what else do I have to do? ;-)<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, just cut back a little on eating. With the increased work you'll be burning calories.  I find that when I'm on a "push" -- sometimes I get the urge to work out hard... like during the summer... I'll go to the gym and do about half an hour of cardio on the cycle, a few reps (about 5 minutes) of crunches with about 120 pounds, the same with reverse crunches, and about half that on each side for my obliques. Then I do some butterflies with from 50-80 pounds depending on the number of reps I decide to do. They also have a couple of machines that I abuse for my upper back and pectorals and lats. Then I go to breakfast. I find that I'm too tired to eat much. That's from about 6:00 to 7:30 or so. Then, about 10:00 I go to the pool and swim two hours... about 4,000 meters and drink an Ensure for lunch. Then I lie around the pool for the next three or four hours (they have 15 minutes of lap swim every hour, so I'll alternate distance and sprints for another 1000 meters or so. By the time it's time to go to dinner, I'm really too tired to eat much. I'll eat fish, or maybe a small salad with balsamic vinegar and some decaf. And REALLY that's all I feel like eating. So the weight comes off.|`|LgKYrup2aa	Avoid alcohol. Not only is it bad for your body - it's also bad for your motivation. You'll find you'll more likely skip a few gym sessions.

Fact that you seem to understand.  While it is true any biologist would declare a single-celled organism as ''alive'', NONE would claim it has any capacity to feel pain.  For that matter, neither does a multicellular homologue like Chlamydomonas.  No sir, a defined and mature nervous system simply doesn't exist until at least 5 months into a pregnancy.  That is a fact.  There is a very different meaning of "alive" in a strictly biological sense, vs. a human medicine sense.<br>  <br>  In regard to your global warming references : The scientists who offer 'evidence' countering modern, and accepted climate theory are weak at best, and represent (at best) 1-2% of the current accredited climate science community.  The equivalent would be about a dozen people scattered throughout the world holding a PhD, claiming that Newtonian gravity didn't exist.<br>  <br>  Scientific theory evolves by consensus upon a given theory, supported by well performed experimentation that is repeatable.<br>  Try learning something about what you claim to be knowledgeable in.<br>  <br>  EDIT : John I truly hope your little ''addition'' was placed before reading both mine and some of the other responses here, as they in no way suggest being ''pissed off'' at any ''scientific fact''.<br>  <br>  In fact John, your diabtribe(s) offer insight into your lack of true understanding of science, scientific theory, method and advancement.  You are an embarrassment to yourself.  I pray no institute of higher education gave you a degree of any kind.<br>  <br>  EDIT : Boss H : well done sir.  If this was my question, you'd get the "best answer".<br>  <br>  EDIT : John, if the goal of this question was to highlight the inherent flaws of the scientific theory and process, and those who subscribe to it...you have failed.  Miserably.  While Boss H's answer does go into alot of abortion talk, mine focuses more on what you claim what the focus of the question.<br>  <br>  I find it interesting that in your final "addition" you did not respond to ANYTHING I mentioned in my answer.  I take it as you basically admitting that you are clueless about what you are discussing here.  You see John, you know nothing, and you thus ARE nothing.

The state government tells you to stick it where the Sun don't Shine when you complain about the high taxes.
3bbtzjBuaa	That they represent California, are liberals (as someone else mentioned), etc. is fairly irrelevant given the direct question you asked, as well as your follow up statement/question.<br>  <br>  Why do they have a say?  Because the people of California are given both a proportionate and an equal stake in American politics (proportionate in the House and equal in the Senate).  The people of California vote for representatives, and the Constitution takes it from there in terms of their role in the government at large.  They have a say because all states have a say (again, to varying degrees depending on the Congressional House).<br>  <br>  Now, when we're talking about national politics (Pelosi, Boxer, Feinstein, etc.) this has very little to do with having "run their state into the ground".  National politics obviously affect the states, but, realistically, one should have more of a gripe with Arnold, if anyone, when discussing the state's economic crisis.  In addition, it's kind of a silly statement to make given the fact that very few states are flourishing in this economy (DC is the only big city expected to raise it's economy this year - 2% rise compared to an expected fall of 1.5% from NYC).  <br>  <br>  Perhaps then you should be calling for a complete overhaul of those in government leading up to this last election?  CA representatives certainly look out for the interests of CA, but the things that got us into this economic mess have almost nothing to do with where representatives are from, and more to do with the inefficient functioning of our government politics (not inefficient by design, but inefficient in the way it's been run by prevailing attitudes of winner take all as opposed to compromise, as well as by the way this attitude has paved a road for the previous party in charge to protect their own interests as opposed to those of the people).  And keep in mind that though these attitudes are not entirely original - rather they have waxed and waned over the decades - the intensity with which these views have been presented, if not forced, has gained immense momentum in the last 20 years or so.<br>  <br>  This has little to do with California alone;  the causality you have 'found' between the California economy and Government policies, between CA representatives and the national economic crisis, and between State and national government activities is forced, if not entirely inaccurate.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Run their state into the ground?<br>  <br>  California is still the largest economy in the United States.

He might be starting another war somewhere in the world (probably not Iran) as an excuse to shovel more taxpayer money to his friends.

acfd17a90a7c10f9eaadcdb4c603f650aa	Civil responsibility is a fairly vague phrase. Most often, civil responsibilities refer to the inherent duties that come with being a citizen of a particular nation, and thus, receiving the benefits of said citizenship. Such responsibilities could include: voting (generally considered the most vital of civil responsibilties); taxes (another important factor, though some would debate this); fulfilling a call-to-duty if conscripted (drafted); and generally acting in an upright manner by obeying laws and avoiding generally accepted moral repugnancies. Hope this helps.

qkvoAYoeaa	I was a trooper in Indiana at that time and worked near the Illinois state line.  I remember seeing Motorola equipment in their cars.  The control heads were under-dash mounted with a separate small speaker, also under-dash mounted.  The transceiver units were hybrid (part vac tube and part solid state) mounted in the car trunk.  I remember 6146 tubes in the transmitter output stage.  These would be some of the first solid state commercial equipment offered by Motorola.  I can't furnish model numbers, however, a commercial repair facility would know.  I drove the '57 Ford Interceptor, on regular patrol, in Indiana for nearly two years.  It was the first really good Ford to come along, for police work.

fLMCOSWdaa	In a socialist democracy things are organised so there are fair shares for all.  In a capitalist democracy it's dog eat dog and every ten years the economy collapses, just to keep the rich, rich.|`|KHSOVxViaa	Politically they're the same.<br>  <br>  Economically they're different.<br>  <br>  Democracy signifies that the people can chose their government (by whatever electoral system), and by implication, remove it by choosing a different one.<br>  <br>  Socialism implies the state directly controls the economy; particularly the means of production, distribution and exchange.  This is the primary means of wealth creation and distribution.  State functionaries decide what goods and services are produced where, and how much.<br>  <br>  Capitalism implies that independent resources can be used to create and fund businesses.  If this is the basis of the economy, then the wealth creation will be done by this process, and non-profit services arranged by the government and paid for via taxation.  Consumer feedback decides what goods and services are produced where, and how much.<br>  <br>  So, to answer the question, the difference is that one has a socialist economy, the other capitalist.  In each case the economic system is implemented by the elected government.|`|acfd17a90a7c10f9eaadcdb4c603f650aa	A socialist democracy, usually referred to as a "social democracy" to avoid being too aligned with "socialism" is more or less the system under which the United States operates today. There is a mix of private enterprise and government-controlled business. There is a large social welfare system (though ideally, a working "social democracy" also has a well-functioning social welfare system unlike that of the United States today), a strong Social Security system, a focus on international diplomacy and multilateralism. At least, that's the Wikipedia definition.<br>  <br>  The problem with your question is that socialism and capitalism are economic systems while democracy is a political system. The difference between socialism and capitalism is simply that socialism encourages government ownership (usually in conjunction with some form of private enterprise, though the extent varies) while capitalism encourages private ownership. In terms of the way the government is run, a "social democracy" differs little (if at all) from a "capitalist democracy" because both employ the democratic system of government in which the people hold direct or indirect political power through the free election of representatives.<br>  <br>  *Clarification/Response to answer: Historically, elected officials have proven themselves no more trustworthy (particularly in terms of controlling the people's money) than board-members of private corporations. Both socialism and capitalism have their strengths and weaknesses. Capitalism, when properly practiced (and under a system not controlled by a central-bank capable of artificially inflating and deflating monetary value, thus leading to boom/bust periods) has proven to be vastly more efficient at providing financial gain, albeit to a fewer number of people. Conversely, socialism is effective at providing the majority of the population with nearly equal economic opportunities while hampering the ability for one to truly become wealthy (by U.S. standards, at least).

nwMBfgcdaa	In Canada (I know you aren't just wanted to clarify another answer), the fines depend on each province's (or territory's) motor vehicle act.  There is not one that starts at 20km/hr over.  <br>  Alot of officers have a certain amount you have to be going over to write a ticket or even stop a vehice.  Most are between 15km/hr and 20.  Few people would even stop a vehicle for 10km/hr over the limit.  I wouldn't worry.  If you were going to be ticketed, you probably would have been when he caught you.  Like other posters have said, there were bigger fish to fry.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Maybe. Here in the US where I live, there are some cities which use cameras. At an intersection for example, they photograph a car if it is over the limit line and runs the red light or on a long stretch of road is speeding. It takes a picture of the license plate with speed data and such in the frame and they send a ticket later to the registered owner of the car. The picture is proof of the infraction. So, if the police snapped a picture of your car and of the reading on the radar, they have proof you were breaking the law and if the law allows, COULD cite you after the fact. Most speed traps work in pairs, with one operating the speed gun and a partner down the road who actually cites you. It is possible the partner was busy with another speeder and you lucked out... Personally, I would not expect to be cited and would just be more careful in the future, but at the same time, if I received a ticket in the mail, I would NOT be surprised either.|`|oMiVzoUpaa	I think the speed gun just records how fast you're going and if you're going over the limit you will get a letter in a few weeks about a fine. I wouldn't say it's not going to happen to you, because you were still over the limit by quite a bit. So I would still be prepared for a fine notice. I don't know if you can call your local police station an ask them to let you know early. You can try it if you're really worried about it.|`|VPAMzE3uaa	Here in Canada fines generally start at 20km/h over the limit and there is no photo radar anymore.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it.  In the end, several factors changed my mind:<br>  <br>  1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:<br>  <br>  2. Cost: Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."|`|kjAQj3i7aa	I would be split too. On one hand, you really do feel that some people deserve to die for their crimes, but then you see some of the horribly traumatic and abusive childhoods paedophiles and murderers etc had, and you wonder whether it is really their fault.

Anyone who is okay with that has seriously got a screw loose.  <br>  Furthermore, people are many times more likely to receive the death penalty if they cannot afford their own lawyer, or if they are a member of a racial minority and the victim was white.  Death in the US is a punishment reserved almost exclusively for the poor and the uneducated, and unfairly targets particular ethnic groups.|`|GtxnGKoAaa	Even though it costs more in tax dollars to execute somebody (legal fees) than to keep them in prison for life some crimes are just to heinous to let a person live any longer.

And I don't mean jail time with TV and other modern conveniences. <br>  Maybe go back to the old chain gang.<br>  Build highways and other hard labor.<br>  Also there has been cases where someone has been given the death penalty and through new DNA testing they were found to actually be innocent.<br>  On the other hand if someone killed or hurt my child I'd want them to die big time !<br>  <br>  Yes it's a very difficult question to answer.|`|e1c7a6271ad6e2c76bcc9db56e32540baa	Our Founding Fathers decided they would rather see ten guilty men be set free than one innocent man denied his freedom.  This is why they created the Bill of Rights (what a lot of people call "technicalities") Considering the Innocence Project has, in the last few years, proven that hundreds of men on death row are in fact innocent, I say until we can know 100%, we need to stop.  I know if you are a victim, or loved one of a victim, this does not look like justice, however, if it were your son or husband being put to death wrongly, you would appreciate the "technicalities" in our system which still does not work correctly. I have no problem putting someone to death... but DNA has lately shown us there are a lot of people waiting to be put to death who are innocent.  How many innocent people have we already executed?

It's my personal opinion that even one innocent person put to death for a crime he or she did not commit is unacceptable. Moreover, the death penalty simply doesn't make sense to me as a punishment. Death-row inmates often spend years in prison after their sentencing during which time they're able to come to terms with their pending execution. Granted, not all people can cope with the fact that they are going to be killed, but it doesn't seem like a stretch to me that given the time they have (and the fact that most are cold-blooded killers with no respect for life), most people sentenced to death are somewhat indifferent to that fact when the time finally comes. [There is the argument that such a long period of time is part of the punishment as they are forced to think about/begin to feel a sense of guilt for their crimes, but I don't subscribe to this philosophy]. That said, my opinion is that labor prisons should be brought back. Just because I don't believe in the death penalty doesn't mean I don't believe in justice. I think that essentially owning a person, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for the rest of their lives is a pretty harsh punishment. If prisons were given the funding they need to expand (both in terms of workforce and sheer floor space), the existence of prison-gangs, black-markets and the use of contraband providing inmates with the pleasures and leisures of the outside world could be nearly abolished. You take a life sentence, one in which no privacy exists, no pleasures exist and the only possessions you have are a stiff bed, a small toilet and a library of second-hand books and you add on a system of serious manual labor (nothing that would constitute cruel and unusual punishment). That gives us a strong deterrent to serious crime AND  a source of cheap labor used for a variety of jobs.|`|YvjPePdIaa	I think that it is completely necessary in the law and that people shouldn't do crimes i beleive that it can be argued that all offences can have the right to death penalty because i think that we should have some order (only murder, rape, etc). One of the major arguments against this theory is that who are we to decide who lives and dies (by we i mean 12 "ignorant" people in a jury that aren't ignorant because they are prepped on the law and listen to the whole case) that it is G-d's job, but according to our system of law we have separation of church and state and in the torah and bible it refers to in the section of the laws an eye for an eye, and in the U.S the only offenses we have for the death penalty are capital offenses, mass murdering, or i forget what else but it is extremely disgusting. If you have any arguments please respond to me i'd be happy to debate this with you.|`|1RhDZnN7aa	The following are arguments that I have heard in the past.<br>  <br>  No judicial system can claim infallibility and a posthumous pardon is no compensation.<br>  <br>  On the practical side and in view of the numerous miscarriages of justice , juries would find it difficult to convict anybody for fear of killing an innocent person.

From prison overcrowding to gang activity here and in Mexico it could all be brought back under control if it was legalized.  The gateway drug lie has been counter productive from the start.

I know dozens of people who smoked and do smoke several of which own their own businesses and all hold steady jobs (or did before the recession). I never tried it myself alcohol and cigars were my drugs of choice but is just like any other legal addictive agent, used in moderation it is fine. Not to mention my brother needs it for his MS.

I am a conservative and I am educated. A lot of the idiots who voted for our idiot president are uneducated. They just voted for Obama, becuse they were dumb enough to listen to the hundreds of false promises he made. Anyone with common sense would know this. Conservatives are educated. A lot of the Republican politicians were educated at top schools like Harvard or Yale. Stupid people (with the exception of Obama) don't go to schools like these. These are schools for smart people.

Rush Limbaugh is undeniably the leader of the pack. It isn't necessarily that the Democrats are "afraid" of him, but they recognize him as a leading force in the opposition and are treating him as such. <br>  <br>  It has been convincingly argued that the Democrats are focusing their attack on Rush in an attempt to paint him as the face of the Republican party, thereby associating the controversial figure with the party as a whole. It's good politics on their part, but I would argue a bit on the dirty side. Weren't the Democrats just complaining about the Republicans playing the radical associations game with them (i.e. Ayers and Rev. Wright)?|`|z6IekuwSaa	Agent Smith lol, you just gave me a good chuckle, I needed that!|`|TD5Wqe4maa	The white house is not afraid of Rush Limbaugh.

Limbaugh is still reeling from Obama saying nothing is going to get done listening to him, and it's true. The GOP has major spring cleaning it needs to attend to and should be making sure Limbaugh has no part of the Republican party,otherwise their popularity will continue to dwindle.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind Rush Limbaugh's followers represent only 15% of the U.S population.

Also that he is not following up on his campaign promises, not not using old Washington insiders in his cabinet, that he will pull out of Iraq on day one, not the day that was already set for withdrawal before he got there.

And heres how, if the man's name is on the birth certificate, or if he lives with you, ect.  Even if he takes a paternity test they will still make him pay child support just for being there.  And possibly for unpaid child support.  I know this first hand.  Yet lets say you have a kid, and had a boyfriend, but he left before you had the child, then yes a paternity test would be necessary to determine if child support was due.|`|phLqHzvaaa	no<br>  only if the presumed father is denying he is the father, then a dna test will be oredered or if the baby mamma is not for sure who the daddy is.<br>  If he doesnt ask for a dna test and signs the parent acknowledgment paper stating that he is the father and five years down the line he finds out he is not the biological father, guess what,here in texas he still has to pay the c/s.amazing huh! thats why if there are any questions of who might be the father, take the test/|`|D8rjkxBTaa	If the man who allegedly fathered the child refuses to support the mother, then a paternity test will come in handy.

Or maybe you have a lower sense of morality and make decisions of convince not ethics. While you may face criminal charges if you kill a dog, cat or other such animal, if you choose to end a life in your womb that almost certainly would  develop into a living breathing human it is your choice. Almost every circumstance for abortion is out of convenience not a medical problem of the supposed mother. At a very early age in the womb the fetus looks  very human.  Look at an aborted fetus and tell me different. If you can live with yourself after aborting a fetus then you really didn't understand the effect you had on another human. This should be  particularly troubling since it would be your flesh and blood.The majority hasn't been correct in many issues. Our most revered presidents were not popular.

They are quicker to adopt minority babies.<br>  <br>  It is the disabled kids and the older kids that get stuck in the system & never get adopted.<br>  <br>  -<br>  <br>  I agree terminating a fetus at the zygote stage isnt murder. <br>  What about partial birth abortion?

NO<br>  <br>  and THANK GOD eco-dunce Gore was wrong|`|GL240ih0aa	Well your correct about Pearl Harbor, we provoked the Japanese into attacked and we even knew they were going to attack (the Australians warned us, look it up). We did everything we could to provoke them, cutting off oil supply lines was just one thing, you see the U.S. was supposed to be neutral yet we were helping the Britain and others with shipments of supplies and arms. That goes against the code for being neutral, so we were asking for it, and we got it. <br>  <br>  the government will do something like this every time they want to go to war. Their called False Flags, the gov. uses them to build patriotic support for war and it works every time! After 9-11 everywhere in the U.S. was sold out of American Flags and a lot of people signed up for the military.<br>  <br>  You can look at every war we've ever been in, and you'll see how the government uses these False Flag Operations. In WWI you have the sinking of the Lusitania which was a ship the Germans brought down that carried American passengers but was also holding a large arms shipment. Unbeknownst to the passengers. The gov. used this as propaganda saying the ship ONLY carried passengers and no arms. Until the truth came out, and now they even teach that one in History classes.<br>  <br>  You have have Pearl harbor in WWII obviously.<br>  <br>  You have the Gulf of Tonkin for Vietnam. But so i don't make this post extremely long, i suggest you look it up. The president refused to call aid to our ship being attack and even said that "that ship needs to go to the bottom". building patriotic support again.<br>  <br>  Skip ahead and now you have 9-11. Perhaps the most obvious of them all. If anyone actually does the research on this, they will find it was a False Flag Op. by our government. Positively. And not even Popular Mechanics or anybody else has done a good job "debunking" it. The problem is, not enough people do their own research on the subject. They just watch Fox News and call everyone who thinks 9-11 was an inside job a nut, because Glen Beck does. America has been seriously dumbed down.<br>  <br>  I suggest everyone do their own research on all of these and find the truth themselves. And for the learners who like to watch instead of read, here is a good starting list:<br>  <br>  Terrorstorm<br>  9-11 Ripple Effect<br>  Zeitgeist<br>  9-11 Truth Rising<br>  Martial Law: Rise of the Police State<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Conspiracy means "Hidden Agenda"<br>  There certainly are a lot of hidden agendas that are true, and too many to name here.|`|AA11572337	That theory about Japan doesn't make sense. If we stopped our shipment of oil to Japan, why would they bomb us? They would for TWO reasons. If they thought they could conquer us in a reasonable amount of time, or if they found another source of oil. They found the other source of oil in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia).

I will post the events that led to this here.<br>  <br>  <br>  But let’s look at what DID get us where we are today shall we.<br>  carter and the libs came up with the CRA, (community reinvestment act) that was to allow low income people the ability to own houses. During clinton term the dems were running Fannie and Freddie, they buy the loans that the banks made, clinton and the dems pushed for them to take in more loans from LOW INCOME people, if they could repay or not, this gave the head guys at Fannie and Freddie bigger bounses and they interned gave money to the dems.<br>  <br>  Now GW took office America was in a recession (just had to add that because obama talks about what he walked into)<br>  <br>  In 2002, 2003 he sees that Fannie and Freddie is getting too big and sees they are making loans that are not good and if something happened then there would be a big problem. The dems blocked any and all attempts fro Republicans to change the regulation that allowed Fannie and Freddie to keep buying sub prime loans<br>  <br>  In 2005 Mc Cain put in a bill to do the same thing, the dems mainly chris dodd of CT filibuster it. The dems all cheered and jumped up and down, the money would still flow.<br>  <br>  Now by this time barney frank had his frank up the fannie of the head guy at Fannie Mae. So no way would he cut off that great soap on a rope sex. Now jaimie gerlick (yes the same one on the 9-11 commision and the same one who with janet reno but up the walls blocking the CIA FBI and law enforcement from exchanging intel that allowed 9-11 to happen) she walked out of fannie mae with 24 million in her pocket, Franklin Raines walked out with 90 million he was there from 1998 - 2004, gee who's watch was that , that's right clintons.<br>  <br>  Here is a few stories and video at how the dems fought to stop any regulation on Fannie and Freddie, and notice the race card being played, After all who care is it the tax payers that will bail them out RIGHT.<br>  <br>  And lets not forget your fearless leader obama was in on this also.<br>  <br>  barney frank should not be running the investigation he should be there testifying as to his part in this robbing of Americans<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi-FZN3ZCG0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi-FZN3ZC...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081209/financial_meltdown.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081209/financial...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/fannie-freddie-ceo-severance-payouts/story.aspx?guid={832C8CA2-92B9-4AE4-9D8F-6105C62DBA1B}&dist=hplatest" rel="nofollow">http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/fa...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/09/fannie-and-freddie-ceos-thrashed/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008...</a>|`|Fyq5nK4waa	Will bottom out around 5700.

So what if you're a POG, you're still doing your part. They may not realize it, but they need you about as much as you need them. It's okay for them to be cocky, they are the ones with the bullets wizzing past their heads. You'd probably be like that too. It's apart of the job title.|`|4t2kd03Waa	If you wanted a combat assignment you should have specialized in a rate that would have put you there.  Beyond that whatever your MOS you should do your very best at all times. I would think that if you let it be known you want to serve in a war time theater you just might get what you ask for.|`|0Jj4lAPMaa	i was exactly the same as u. i no wut ur feeling. i signed up for the army and am doin cannon crewmember, its combat and it is kinda interesting. just do wut u think is best for u, and if u dont wanna do combat than dont u will just be miserable... but i totally get where u are coming from|`|DUtOWHARaa	Why should a Soldier feel bad?
968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	it doesn't matter, as long as they can see it<br>  <br>  I wear mine on my chest <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/2961106261_dd6d584708_b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/2961...</a>|`|25Cu0kjFaa	Right arm, a few inches below the shoulder seam.|`|VXQFT341aa	Right.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	Have you checked that it won't offend anyone? Here in the UK, we are not supposed to show our flag, in our OWN country. Local councils in certain areas don't like it as it might offend minorities. It doesn't matter that THEY offend many of us who were born here.|`|MTF0Rz90aa	Left.<br>  Ja.|`|fQsbcRtVaa	i think left|`|7f1TfskEaa	The Canadian military wears it on the left.<br>  The US wears the flag on the right.  The right arm is the "sword" arm.  It is what you use for protection.  The left is closer to your heart.  That is why in a wedding the bride is on the left of the groom and he is on her right.<br>  <br>  I guess it depends on which symbolism you are going for.|`|oT7i0hh3aa	Left !!!!
BImIMnbzaa	I don't believe that American's have any preference over one Asian race over another.  The countries in Asia are quite another matter.  As an example, Americans feel a closeness to the people of South Korea, yet suspicion and alienation towards North Koreans, yet they are the same people.<br>  <br>  Japan is a country that we fought a bloody war against, yet since its surrender, the two country's have grown closer, even with the competitiveness and cultural differences between the two.<br>  <br>  The US is a land of many cultures and a diverse society with people from every country on earth.  It must practice tolerance to all men, or the internal strife will destroy it.|`|zJecdxXcaa	The Japanese migrated from the Korean Peninsula, not China.<br>  <br>  And whites don't look down on and hate asians.<br>  <br>  Americans don't like what the Japanese did in World War II.<br>  <br>  And they like Jackie Chan more than Toshiru Mifune.  That should settle the issue.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	What is this even supposed to mean?  Most Japanese are NOT "from China."  That claim is simply false.|`|lJGnuMbbaa	you are mixed up Chinese were around before japan|`|RsG2AAXzaa	The video games and electronics. <br>  <br>  The U.S politicians loved Japan because they essentially ran your government by proxy during the post war period. The LDP is a remnant of that.|`|u99Z7uJQaa	PS3 Wii Comic Anime Culture Toyota Etc etc<br>  <br>  Americans dont hate Chinese, only hate their gov't.|`|d7570355e6c141f9b4bc359d2fb03aa1aa	What makes you think whites dislike Asians, for what reason? I can't think of even one reason myself, even a made up one|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	they are a democracy. Plus we helped to rebuild that country after wwii. <br>  We get along with other countries in Asia.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I don't agree with your perception of how caucasians feel about asians, but nationally, we like Japan because they are an ally and they like us.  China will shoot down our passenger planes if they accidentally get into the airspace.
3WsUKHWBaa	Not sure....I did 50 in a 35, and the tix was $212. So it should less than that.
Gezfmghuaa	Your local government will have noise ordinances which specify what level of volume is allowed and when.  If the child is in violation of those, the parents can be cited.  In general, as long as the play is during normal working/play hours, there's not much you can do unless it is truly excessive.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	If your thinking of something like, "disturbing the peace," forget about it.<br>  <br>  The law won't see this the same way you do. If his parents aren't cooperating, looks like you in for a long, noisy ride.|`|e1c7a6271ad6e2c76bcc9db56e32540baa	You have a right to the "quiet enjoyment" of your property, regardless of what or who is disrupting that enjoyment. However, trust me when I tell you these things are best worked out in a non confrontational manner.  Legal intervention should be your last resort.  You don't mention whether you rent or own....  if you own and so do your neighbors it is truly best to try to ask for a little  cooperation.  You're going to be close to your neighbors for a long time.  You can sue for your quiet enjoyment (civilly), but, it is expensive and I have never seen it work out well yet.|`|qOG7AoZwaa	i am a deputy in new mexico and we get this call all the time.  in most cases it is not necessarily illegal for the child to be loud. Now if the child becomes a harassment where he openly threatens you or someone in your home you can file a police report and file on your own for harassment charge.  many states have different laws on disturbing the peace.<br>  here are some suggestions.<br>  1 find out who is responsible for your community CITY OR COUNTY <br>  2 ask them what the laws are<br>  3 if they cant do anything you can go to civil court (not recommended) time consuming and creates too much problems<br>  <br>  in most cases you can have a officer talk to the family and a majority of the time the problem will some what subside.  <br>  Warning if police get involved try the anonymous approach first because the potential for retaliation exists.|`|LsAArkUyaa	Unless it is in the middle of the night, it is very likely there is nothing you can do. Heck we have neighbors that keep shoot off guns or fireworks all night long and we are told their is no law against it.
