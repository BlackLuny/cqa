20090220220457AALmTg3	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do I have bad friends or am I just crazy?	I'm 17 years old. Of all my friends, I am the only virgin... the only person who hasn't done/ isn't doing drugs and I don't cut myself.   Sometimes I feel the pressure of doing these things. I'm a regular teenager, not particularly geeky or anything. Nor am I very religious. I've had plenty of chances to do these things, but I've always decided in the end it didn't coincide with my values.   Today I found out that my friend (a person I trusted a lot as someone with values similar to mine) had sex with a 21 year old she met online, and almost got pregnant. I was shocked, and a little upset. (but I was polite and everything..)   Based on the people I know, I'd say its pretty rare for someone to still be a virgin at 17. Sometimes it makes me feel crazy and lonely... Do you think what I'm doing is good, even though I'm the only person doing it? What should I do to make myself feel less alone?

20090220220925AAuR5Tu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls? I need help understanding your mind..?	Ok there is this girl, she has been a great friend. We got real close because of marching band. She started calling me her "brother" and she always leaned up against me at the football games and marching competitions. I started to like her but she ckept calling me her brother so i backed off. Well we kind of stopped communicating because she changed schools. The other day last week i was at work, i got a call over the radio from one of my fellow employees that a girl was waiting for me. Well apparently she does this everyime she comes to the mall to see if i am there. We started talking again and she told me that she has a crush on me. So we started to hang out and we went to our winter formal together. But, all of a sudden she keeeps bringing up all of her ex boyfriends and is kind of emotional. She tells one of my friends thats she met at the dance that she does not have like me that way anymore. What i am confused on is that she and i text and talk a lot on the phone. She will say stuff like nighty-night and good morning love. What is her deal? She says she dosent want a relationship but when we hang out it seems like she does, but she tells my friends different?

20090220220714AA6WRGw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell if my boyfriend is cheating or wanting to cheat?	So me and my boyfriend have been dating for 8 months now. We have always been honest with each other. We started talking while he had a girlfriend via facebook. I know how he can be a smooth talker...that's how he got me. He told me how he has cheater on all most all of his past girlfriends. And he is known to be very promiscuous. So lately he has been acting shading. A few long stories have led me to believe that something is up. Just today I asked to look at his messages on his facebook, so see who is talking to privatly. He acted as if the world had ended. His body language led to me believe he had something bad to hide. Long behold he was talking to one of his 'hot' exs. He asked if she wanted to get coffee sometime. His explaination was "he was just being nice." Should I believe him, and what should I do to try to find out more? Thanks!

I was warned about him before I dated the guy that he moves on very fast. After a bunch of research I was also told that he cheated on his ex constnatly and thats why they broke up. He said that he had a hard time feeling emotions for people and he used to do messed up things as a child like stick his mothers hand holding a fork in a light socket. I also heard his friend saying when he sees blood and stuff *Cuz theyre paramedics* that he feels nothing. I dont know all I know is he broke up with me like *that* and was cheating on me too and had a girl behind my back ready and she just took my place...then I heard recently hes got bored with her and is trying to get his ex back on the side. Do u think he is one, or do u think hes just a jerk? anyone??He also compulsively lies and ive caught him in straight out lies based on no truth!!!

I do everything I can for her, when she needs money I give even though it is only my husband that works and I stay home with my 3 children. and she works and so does her boyfriend who makes 3x as much as my husband makes. I babysit free of charge, and even go shopping for her when she doesn't have the time,with my own money and never bring it up.   she has 2 boys ages 9 and 3, and I am 23, I know BIG space between, she treats them like her little angels, but if i just need someone to talk to she never has the time, and when i say I am sad and I need to talk, she tells me to grow up and get over it, i know this is a big run on sentence but it is coming for the heart.   My mother used to beat me when I was younger,until i was 16, I started working then saved for a year to move, I have even been taken from my mother from the abuse.    I am having some bad thought because I am just so sad, and my mother doesn't even care, all she cares about is her boys and her boyfriend.    HELP! what should i do?
20090220221933AARMpWQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need your advice about work drama?	Okay, to make a long story short, I am a very optimistic person.  I try to bring a positive attitude do work every morning.  Well, my boss happens to be a very positive person as well and we encourage each other in our daily conversations.  He is single, but there is nothing there; we are just good friends at work.  I thought that having a positive attitude at work would keep me free from drama, but boy was I wrong!        Well, a heavyset lady that also works in the office continuously keeps shredding rumors about me to the other employees that I am “after” the boss.  It is in a very dishonoring way too.  She is acting like because I am an optimistic person that I am a flirting with him.  I don’t want to quit talking to him or talk in a less enthused way, because I feel like all her bad gossiping will be affecting me, and that it will also look like it was true, when it wasn’t.        She walked by me today and gave me a smirk and then immediately told the boss in a cryptic code that she had something very important to tell him.  It was almost as if she was going to tell him to watch out because I was "after" him.  After they went into the office, he came out and acted like he believed her.  Now my reputation is ruined!  It was so rude!!  I feel sick about this whole thing, and want to quit work today.  I can’t believe that this woman is in her 40’s and is still acting this immature!  Do you have any advice for me?      Thanks everyone for your advice!

20090220152450AAYmf4p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you believe this like i do?	are you like me and think that parents who are extreamly over protective of their children end up getting what they dont want as in...they wont let their daughter/son go out with someone or be friends with certain people because they think they are going to do things like have sex, do drugs or whatever other bad things could happen that once they finally do let the kids go that they are more likley to rebel against the parents by doing what the parents were worried they would do.

20090220164444AA7U0cL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think those unmarried rockstars remain happy when they get older?	how do they find their lives satisfying? is it really satisfying to just sleep with random girls who they must KNOW only sleep with them because of who they are? do you think maybe they just really don't care? they act like they don't care.. but deep down inside don't you think we all crave for someone to love and to love us back? especially as we age and watch our friends get married?
20090425002625AAb50fM	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you ignore...?	someone? Successfully. I know it's not best to ignore someone when your fighting, but the other day my friend & I got into a disagreement, so now were upset with each other.      Last night we were both at a party and we basically ignored each other the whole time. It didn't bother me, I didn't feel like putting up with her when I was supposed to be having a good time.       Now were going out with our friends today and I basically need tips on avoiding her while I'm out. If she talks to me, what tone should I use? because I'm not quite ready to forgive her for the things she said to me during our disagreement.

20090220222258AA8LVvg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Told him to stop but he still doesn't?What do i do?	Ok this married man in my neighborhood had been acting strange and giving me stares out of the windows of his car and moving his head 90 degrees to look at me without even concentrating on the road. I had to tell his friend that he needs to stop and i didn't like it at all. After his friend told him to stay away. I still sometimes notice him doing the same thing, like yesterday he was on his bike and i was with my brother and then again while driving his bike he moved his head to look at me.      I really don't know how to behave now because i thought the warning would scare him off and i wont have to deal with him again, but he is just does not move back. He even does that when i am with my brother, though i have not told my brother, seems like he isn't scared. Now what do i do with this creep?

20090220223226AA5XstK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP!!!  Does This Girl Like Me?	Yeah so we've been talking online a bit lately... I surprised her with a little gift for V-Day, which she liked a lot... And yeah I do know her in person, but I never really see her long enough to converse with her...      If I do see her, I'll make sure to say "hi" and such and she always smiles really big and greets me back, she sometimes waves her hand... And there's usually great eye-contact between us... One time we held a smile and eye-contact for like a good 8 seconds or so (as I approached... we saw each other and locked-eyes from quite a bit of a distance away... and from there, she actually greeted me first...) This is all very recently.       To my surprise, I'm even in her "top friends" on myspace now... And yeah there really isn't a whole lot of personal interaction between us. Its mostly been online. With such eye-contact tho like I descibed and body language, does she seem attracted to me?      Does it sound like she likes me, like even more than a friend?      I really like her and I want to know if the feelings seem mutual between us...       Thanks! :)

20090220222551AAIc5ZR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to do with my feelings.?	I still like my ex boyfriend, we only dated for 2 months but liked each other for 4 months. He broke up with me because of some issues we've been having. It was always unclear to us whether we were in a relationship. I always thought we were just dating then he'll say were in a relationship. It was crazy. My friends constantly tells me stuff and believe them and do what they think I should do. I broke up with him a couple of times because of some things he's done and then talk me out of it. He broke it off in the end and I was fine with it, even though it hurt me a lot. I didn't chase after him for a month, i didn't do any ex-girlfriend psycho actions.. Then after a month of breaking up, we we on contact again as friends, I greeted him a Happy Birthday text. This Valentines day he asked me to go hiking with him and i went. It wasn't awkward, he would flirt with me and just stare at me. I want to tell him I still like him but then I don't want to ruin the friendship we have now. I realize I still like him after I asked him if he dated someone else after me and he said yes, and it made me feel jealous. How do I cope with this, is it good to tell him?      Additional Details   he's not dating anyone else right now. he did, but it didn't work out between them.

20090220224059AAO5yvN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, will you be inferior if ..?	.. your girlfriend social status (family wealth) is higher than yours? If both of you really love each other but the girl's parents look down on your family's status , will you give up the girl because you don't think you can provide her with happiness and the richer life she is having? If the girl persuades you that she can work hard for a future together with you after marriage, but have constant discrimination from the family , will you still be with her? Or would you go for someone who matches or has a more humble background, so that you are sure you can provide a better life to her.      thank you.

20090220152634AAZFsKG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does the fact that my boyfriend doest have a job, make him a loser?	Posted question from 02/19/2009   Does the fact that my boyfriend doest have a job, make him a loser? I’m 20 years old, have my own car, go to school, and work part time. My boyfriend is currently going to school taking 15 units. My problem here is that he doesn’t have a job and I end up paying 70% of the time and him only 30%. Might I add he does not have a car. I love him very much; we connect on a deep level. I happy that I have him in my life, I just feel taken for granted sometimes. It doesn’t help when my mother mocks me saying things like, “you boyfriend lucked out..got him a suga mama”. Sometimes I feel like HE IS THE GUY, I want to be catered to lol. I just don’t know if I’m dating a loser. He is going to school, rite? Says thank you when I give him rides, and loves me. So now that you know the history, does the fact that my boyfriend doest have a job, make him a loser?      Thanks,    Brook         UNDERSTANDING: 02/20/2009   Thanks for the answers. I think the point of my message was conveyed wrong. All I wanted to get across was that I feel taken for granted sometimes. Yes, at times I get caught up in the social idea that the guy should carry most of the financial burden but then I realize that this is society telling me what to think and I believe in equality, truthfully I do. Sex shouldn’t be an indicator of who pays for what and how much. A point was said that “when should your boyfriend be at all financially responsible for you?” well when should I be financially responsible for him? The thing is I’m naturally a giving person. Only being in this relationship for three months, I don’t want to have rose colored glasses on and be taken advantage, one can’t help but start to feel this way after giving and giving….but its love right? I should want to give this much and hold no expectations?  ! I see I stated my question entirely wrong, people who don’t have jobs are defiantly not losers. However if person takes advantage of another, holds on to their partner because they care about them and are willing to pay for most everything, I think this in someway makes them a loser.

20090220175546AAVxQs1	Family & Relationships;Family	Why is my dad like this?	My sister, when she was my age (15) was a druggie, promiscuous, and getting awful grades. Even though I told myself I'd never be like that, but alas, teenagerdom grabbed hold....         I'm not a druggie, but my dad thinks I'm addicted to medicine. Like NyQuil, Advil, DayQuil, and energy drinks. I'm not VERY promiscuous, but i still keep my romance life very far from his knowledge. The last thing I need is him on my back for even KNOWING a guy. Lastly, I'm horrible in school and am failing almost everything.       But I'm nowhere near as bad as my sister was. Maybe its because he's afraid I will be, or maybe it's because I never had behavior problems before this year, but how do I get him to stop yelling at me for things like that?
20090220175507AAfKjUc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me and my boyfriend can't keep in contact:his parents treat him like a child and i have a problem with this!!?	So i have been with my boyfriend for about 8 months now, including the time we were dating/talking and we are very much in love. However, i feel like i'm having big problems with him. We used to go to the same school, we're were on the same sports team. he'd walk me to class, walk me home after practice so we'd see each other all the time. However, he just recently transferred to a school that can help him further his future in sports and i can only see him on the weekends.  He's parents are extremely strict and don't allow him to go out or talking on the phone at ALL. when we go on dates or want to hang out he has to either lie or sneak out the house like we're little kids, mind you we're both juniors in high school. . He doesn't have a cell phone, he keeps saying he ordered the sim card but it never came in. his parents dont allow him to use the house phone, he used  to sneak it for a few minutes on occasion, but since his dad been working at home lately, he can't. we went out on valentines day. he got home at 5 o clock in the afternoon and he got GROUNDED....we havent talked in a whole week, no emails, no calls. nothing. when he finally calls me, he'll say  its because of his dad watching the phone everyminute, i believe'cause his sister, who goes the same school as i, complains about it too.  im really just sick and tired of it . i mean i love him so very much,i know he loves me too, and i know if we are in love it shouldnt matter but it does. am i wrong for feeling like this?? what would you do in my position? [and please don't tell me try to talk to his parents because they would KILL him if they found out he has a girlfriend...thats out of the questiion]. PLEASE HELP!

When I get invited to parties, they immediately say "no" because they don't know the parents of my friends, and in school, I'm social, so I have a lot of friends/acquaintances. I can say, without exaggeration, that they treat me as a 7 year old. I can't even watch the TV shows all the kids my age watch, and I am restricted to cartoons and game shows.      I have tried time and again to tell them that no one else my age is treated this way and they get to go wherever they want and can go to all the parties and houses they want, but they say that what they do does not affect us. Furthermore, because they were raised in a different country, and look down on American culture excessively, they say my complaints are signs of me being infused with the so-called "American filth"      So please help me, please guide me

20090220174423AAjajPc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If a single man met an attractive married woman while on vacation?	is it likely that he is only looking for friendship given the following:       - We call and text about 1x per week, usually a text back and forth one week and a call the following week.      - Our conversations are friendly but he does try hard to impress me with his travels and such and pokes fun at my lack of international travel.      - He went to boarding school and is very reserved and stated this to me (so I am not sure if he could have feelings that he isn't going to put out there).       -both in our 40s and successful biz people      The whole british thing has me confused as I find him very difficult to read.

But I didn't dance till the second hour since I felt dizzy. So, I only got to dance with him a little cause he said his feet hurt from dancing in the first hour. But I saw him slow dancing with my best friend/old classmate, but I think he danced with her cause he's the one who invited her to go (I was supposed to, but I used up my plus 1) Then, I slow danced with my ex boyfriend since, I wanna talk and just be nice. Then I saw my crush sitting on stage, and I sat on stage too and hugged him from behind and he was holding my hand, the hand near his chest.      and he asked me      "How was your dance with *him (ex boyfriend)?"      "It was..err... OK..It doesn't feel right anymore"      and he said "It looked Hott!"      and I said while rubbing my cheek on his shoulder "Yeah, but it doesn't feel right"      I held his hand a bunch of other times that night, and when I danced with him he said "You should've asked me to dance earlier!" then, I didn't want his feet to get hurt more, so I let him sit down. :)

20090220180457AAN1ie8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need advice on this CONFUSING GUYY?	There's this boy named Jake and hes in my math class, he is wicked quiet and shy in school. I always thought that he kind of liked me because he smiles at me alot. Well one night I got a call from jake and I dont know how he got my number I didnt answer it because i was sleeping so the next day I called his phone and it said, "hey its jake im not here leave me a message", so i hung up and texted him asking who he was since he called my phone and he never replied back. I know jake has texting and I know that the message got sent. I notice when i went to class the next day he was smileing at me alot and would walk near my desk but he wouldn't say anything, and Im really shy too I smiled at him too. But one day at lunch i told my friend about him and i told her that i was surprised that he called me because of how quite he is and I think someone at my table told him that I called him quite and that day I went online and Jake had an away message saying "Think im quite? probably because you never said anything that I could respond to, so pissed off."    As of now he still smiles at me I use to sit up front and he use to sit in the back and the teacher changed our seats and im in the back now and Jakes up front I can tell hes nervous and I dont want him to feel that way...   Alot of people will tell me to make the first move but I am really shy just like Jake   Why was he pissed off?   what do you guys think?   Do you think he even did like me or maybe still kinda does   I know its hard to tell   but give me your best answer it will mean alot to mee

20090220175857AA7mQta	Family & Relationships;Family	Lack of privacy at home.?	My husband and I have a carport so you can tell when we are home and whenever were not at home. I absolutely hate this. Family members and friends always comment saying "Where were yall at?" "Where did yall go?" "Yeah whenever I went by I saw your car was gone." That annoys me. I feel like it's nobodys business where I am going or what I am doing unless if I make it their business. Another thing is if someone comes up we cannot just ignore the door we have to go because they know we are here. And of course there is the we are too close to our neighbors. I don't want to hear their conversations and I don't want them hearing mine. Anyone else super annoyed with these kind of things?

20090220181104AAlvo01	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to deal with a best friend with a big ego?	My best friends ego > Kanye West's ego. Seriously.   It's really annoying. Everything is always   "Oh, I'd look really good it that. I'd totally rock that."    "My hair looks so good today."    "He totally thinks I'm hot."      And she is ALWAYS TEXTING!!!! It's terrible! Whenever we are hanging out, she can't stop texting her boyfriend, or texting people who "want to hang out with her". I can't stand it!      and she always kinda puts me down, like telling me my hair is messed up, or my shirt looks funny, or makes fun of me because I have a smaller chest than her, or because I'm not as popular/pretty as her.       Like she makes fun of me because I've never had a boyfriend (i'm 17) by asking her boyfriend to set me up and stuff. And I'm kinda shy and I find it really embarrassing and stuff.      I'm just a really passive person though, like I don't want to bring it up because I hate confrontation. But I can't take it anymore! Can someone help me find a way to bring it to her attention WITHOUT being mean?

(Not seriously)       She's always texting, bragging about something, talking about her boyfriend or other guys who think she's "awesome" and I just can't stand it anymore.       What should I do!?

20090220191739AA9LnEv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	13 Reasons to Smile.......?	*Now that food has replaced sex in my life, I can't even get into my own pants.   *Marriage changes passion. Suddenly you're in bed with a relative.   *I saw a woman wearing a sweat shirt with "Guess" on it, So I said "Implants?" She hit me.   *How come we choose from just two people to run for president and fifty for Miss America?   *A good friend will come and bail you out of jail...but, a true friend will be sitting next to you saying, "Damn...that was fun!"   *I signed up for an exercise class and was told to wear loose-fitting clothing. If I HAD any loose-fitting clothing, I wouldn't have signed up in the first place!   *When I was young we used to go "skinny dipping," now I just "chunky dunk."   *Don't argue with an idiot; people watching may not be able to tell the difference.   *Wouldn't it be nice if whenever we messed up our life we could simply press 'Ctrl Alt Delete' and start all over? AMEN, AMEN!!   *Why is it that our children can't read a Bible in school, but they can in prison?   *Wouldn't you know it... Brain cells come and brain cells go, but FATcells live forever.   *Why do I have to swear on the Bible in court when the Ten Commandments cannot be displayed in a federal building?   *AND I've learned....

20090220190110AAa4VGt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	The Most Perfect Breasts....... (adult joke)?	A guy walking down the street sees a woman with perfect breasts. He says to her, "Hey miss, would you let me bite your breasts for $100 dollars?   "Are you nuts? !!" she replies, and keeps walking away. He turns around, runs around the block and gets to the corner before she does.   "Would you let me bite your breasts for $1,000 dollars?" he asks again.   "Listen you; I'm not that kind of woman! Got it?" So the guy runs around the next block and faces her again. "Would you let me bite your breasts just once for $10,000 dollars?"   She thinks about it for a while and says, "Hmmm, $10,000 dollars, eh? Ok, just once, but not here. Let's go to that dark alley over there."   So they go into the alley, where she takes off her blouse to reveal the most perfect breasts in the world. As soon as he sees them, he grabs them and starts caressing them, fondling them slowly, kissing them, licking them, burying his face in them, but not biting them.The woman finally gets annoyed and asks, "Well? Are you gonna bite them or not?"   "Nah", he replies. "Costs too much..."

20090220184240AAHhDaV	Family & Relationships;Friends	It's just ridiculous. They don't know a thing about flirting.?	There's the guy that I liked last year, wayyyyyy back. A lot back. I found out this year that he is a total douchebag and a loser and now I don't like him as even a friend.      And, there's this girl. Known her since 2nd grade. She's a *****. Nver actually liked her. She thinks she's hot and always tries to show her stomach. She always thinks all these guys that just talk to her like her. Just as simple as that. Um, I talk to guys a lot and they talk to me, but that DOESN'T mean we like each other. It's just common sense. She doesn't know anything. I have a strong feeling that she said these things just to make me mad. She's a two-faced little ***** who always wants to cause drama.      One of my other friends, Emily, keeps telling me that the girl is always saying that I flirting with the guy to him. She's like, "Oh, watch out. Cassandra loves you and she's gonna be flirting with you on the bus." Not true. I don't like him one bit. I hate her. Can a ***** learn to shut the **** up?      All I ever say to him is "You're a loser." "You're such a douchebag." and I mean it! Seriously. He is... both. Apparently, that's "flirting". Pffft. Whatever. When I like guys, I don't try to make them hate me by saying stuff like that.      So, on the bus, he was like, "Stop flirting."   Me: I'm not. You really are a douchebag. I'm not even joking.   Him: You love me. Whatever.   Her: You sooooo like him. You flirt so much,   Me: That's not flirting.   Her: Oh yeah. Suuuree.   Me: Dude, shut up! You don't know anything, anyway. That wasn't flirting.   Her: Oh, Cassandra's maddd. Haha.   Me: I do not like him!   Her: Obviously you do if you keep going on and on about it.   Me: No. I don't!      And, then, I see her whispering stuff into his ears and looking over at me. I seriously want her to jump off a bridge. People like that are horrid and annoying.      What do you think and what can I do to great rid of this ***** besides the violent methods?      (By the way, I know I seem mean by this, but I'm really nice to other people. This is just me, defending myself and being a friend. Both of them have done  horrible things to my best friend and I hate them. They've done even worse things to me! Usually, I treat people with respect and just "joke around" with them. These 2 people are little devils and I hate them both. Thank you. :])
20090220194353AAt4Wxr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	For the ladies who keeps it real...?	This is for the ladies. Do you believe that you should do whatever it takes to keep your marriage?   I am wondering because I read some of the comments on here and a lot of the women have bee cheated on.
20090220183727AAIvd0j	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are his friends more IMPORTANT to him than I AM ? Dump him for THEIR insults ?	I'm afraid that the guy Im dating considers his longterm friends, male and female much more important to him than I am.      I get along very well with a lot of people, have a lot good friends of my own and am very happy and outgoing.      We've dated long distance  for few months and been friends ourselves for nearly 18 months.   Well he tells a lot of stories about how his friends either drink smoke, gossip and whatnot.   he is 35 and theyre all early 30s.   professional educated people in washington dc   he has known them since either college or law school days.   for some reason he seems to care a lot about their opinions.      he told me two things about their reactions that has bothered me a lot   first he said one friends wife thought i looked like a very attractive escort from my headshot. (what the heck ? from my headshot ? i barely wear make up and am more prepster than anything else)   and then another female friend told him she liked me until she saw a greeting video clip i made to my friends.   I dont know why he showed them these private things of mine and then told me negative reactions. he seemed to think it was funny.      now he keeps going out with them and gets sloppy drunk.   i mean theyre in their 30s and making themselves sick drinking....   he said his one friend cant wait to give birth to he rbaby so she can resume chain smoking and drinking    he seems to think thats funny.   i joked that im not crazy about the sound of his friends and that he is lucky i have a bunch of warm healthy friends to introduce him to.   he replied well *I should just try hard to make THEM like me*   I replied well actually he should hope they try to make me like THEM   he got things upside down.      I m really disappointed that he thinks i should be the one impressing them.      should i judge him for his attitudes towards them ?   they just sound like mean people with bad habits....      thanks !   (ill add that every other bf i had had AWESOME friends who were naturally nice)

20090220184948AAd4GuL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me?	Hi, I can't figure out if this guy in my class likes me because I like him. Sometimes I see him staring at me and then I turn my head to see if he was and if he was staring at me he would turn his head quickly. He would always make fun of me (sometimes). And today when it was the end of school I went to my locker (by the way my crushes locker is right next to mine) and I opened it and then my crush closed it and put his lock on my locker and I don't know his locker combination so I told him to open it and he said no so I put my lock on his, but then he opened it.      I don't know if he likes me.      How do I know if he likes me though because he does some other stuff too, that I didn't put in here.      Thanks!
20090220190635AAICwt3	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel 2nd best, and like my best friend doesnt really care?	Ok so my best best friend ever is amazing, we laugh our heads off, do fun stuff, hang out almost everyday...   but a lot of the time i feel so second best. For instance, with some of her other Bff's she runs up to them and gives them a hug and always is like "I love u" and her taglines on AIM and stuff are like "ily (____)!!!! Bestfriendsforever" But that never happens with me. I have really been feelign alone lately and going through some hard things, and i need a hug so bad-yet i have to pretty much like beg half the time..with her other friends its automatic and they dont even need it like i do. Sometimes at the end of convos she says "lyl", but it feels like she does that cuz she feels like she HAS to or something. With her other friends is like "I LOVE UUU!"...im jst like..ok..I mean DONT SAY SHE NOT A REAL FRIEND! she is, shes a wonderful friend, she just doesnt realize what shes doing to me. And when i tell her my probs she will be super nice and care, but then she jst stops caring at other times it feels like and i think she jst doesnt really care. I dont know wat to do..

20090220190924AACjPbG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would this situation make you angry as well?	You go to the school to pick up your child. And the office hands you a bill for your cousins child. The reason is, my cousin told them to give me her bill saying that I can afford it. I  did write them a check on the spot. Then I called my cousin and told her that I was pissed at what she did. And all she had to say was that, what's the big deal, it's not like you can't afford it. So I'm still mad as Hell.
20090220183900AAWQalC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Neighbor problems...any advice?	My husband and I purchased an apartment building in Oct. Across the road is a house that is rented out. When we first moved into an apartment in our building the family across the road was very nice we never had any problems with them.  Before Christmas the family moved and another moved in.  This family is very bothersome. They have a large dog that comes into our yard. They will call the dog but it never goes back. They make no effort to retrieve the dog. They simply ignore it then until it goes back. I feel a little effort should be made. Now, they have four wheelers they are constantly riding. They always ride between 8 and 11 pm along the main road in front of our building. They stop in front of our building and rev the four wheelers.. Last Saturday morning I woke up to the fourwheelers (it was the one and only time they rode in the AM) As I went to the window to check on the noise (it sounded like a large vehicle was parked in front of the building) I saw the fourwheeler coming out of our side driveway.  Upon further inspection we found their track marks in our drive way. Our tenants have started complaining of the noise.    The house they rent is very nice with a nice large yard. Yet the yard is marked beyond belief. (If I were the landlord and saw it they would be out) It is going to be a huge mess this spring. I hate to call the landlord or the police because I do not want to begin causing problems. We enjoy being outside especially in nice weather and I do not want problems when we are in our yard this summer. But at the same time the situation is becoming very irritating. Who is the best to contact? (The landlord of the house has a brother who lives next door so I am assuming they are ok with the noise and the yard with muddy rivets.) I think what is most irritating is one evening around 5 pm we took my neices and nephews into my yard to sled ride and these people called the police on us! we were not loud or anything. The officer that came told us to ignore it that we were doing nothing wrong and he does not know why they called. But the  neighbor had the gull to say she called.

20090220192911AAXWP7n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can Prostitutes provide the same love and warmth that a wife can?	Ok, I am 25 and I have never been able to get a girlfriend. So last summer I started paying prostitutes. I have found that if you get the right prostitute it can be very fulfilling. The last one I had we didn't just have sex... We took a bath together, we kissed on the lips, she rubbed her fingers on my chest, and we even cuddled while watching a movie. Of course I've never had a girlfriend or a wife and was wondering if this is what it feels like to have a love partner?
20090220194005AAxe53v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	INSTANT CHEMISTRY?!?!?!?!?! does he like me?!?	Okay.. I ask a LOT of guy questions but im just exploring right now. im only 14.       Anyway.. my family is going to get a new doggy. She was rescued from abuse and we are going to adopt her. =] So we went to the foster family's home to meet the dog and she was sooo sweet. my mom had previously told me that they had a son in my grade but i was like okay. i didn't expect to meet this amazing dude. Well while i was getting to know Bailey the son came downstairs. I saw him and we couldn't stop staring at each other. He walked around and straight back upstairs. Then all I could think about was him.. i heard someone coming down the stairs and it was him. My heart pounded so hard i swear the lady and my parents and my sister could hear. And i started swallowing loudly. I realized he was nervous too. He sat down NEXT TO ME on the couch and just pet the dog with me. And most kids crack their knuckles when they are nervous.. not only was i cracking mine like crazy so was he! and when there was no more to crack we kept trying. Later we were leaving and we walked by the door and he looked really upset.. he stood by the banister and looked at me and then left. In the car my dad said "That boy seemed awfully nervous.. and it was either because of the dog leaving or he really liked you Tara." I didn't say anything so i think my parents got the point i liked him. and my mom said "Well he has to be used to dogs comming and going because they are a foster family." And omg tell me!! I am going to go to their house one more time on Tuesday to pick up the dog and i wana some how get his name at least or his number.. but i wont be able to catch him alone!! what can i do.. AHHHHH please pray for us. I can tell he's caring by the way he was to his mom and his dogs. =] HELPP MEE!!!!!

20090220194823AAEDg34	Family & Relationships;Family	I feel like I'm the only one grieving for her.?	I guess you could call me a care giver, i work with young adults who are medically fragile. Let's call her Sara. Sara was 25 years old, she died last week of pneumonia, she had developmental problems from a young age, (Rett Syndrome) so she looked like she was 12, and she had the mind set of a toddler, also didn't have the ability to walk talk or eat. (fed through tubes) She was a beautiful little girl, bright blue eyes, adorable smile, and I felt like I had a special bond with her I could always maker her laugh, I was helping to take care of her for the last two years along with other staff members. I seriously loved her like a daughter, i know that sounds a little strange. When she passed away I was devastated, couldn't stop crying.   But it seems like everyone else at work doesn't care...they carry on as if nothing has changed, they just gathered up all of her things and set them in her room for her mom and family to pick up this weekend. (She lived in a house with three other medically fragile adults)...   I feel like I'm not allowed to grieve for her...like it would be unprofessional or something, but i feel like i'm dying on the inside, like a piece of my heart was torn out and i don't know how to deal with it.   Any advice?

20090220191059AASNo0f	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Guy in my class has become a creepy stalker?	Im a senior,   there's this guy in my class who I talked to once. Told him Hello, and he held open the door for me, so I thanked him.      Now he is constantly texting me.   Funny things that happened, his favorite things to do/favorite things, he texted me, "What did I miss in Biology?" earlier today and I didn't respond, so he texted me again 5 minutes later with the same sentence and again and again up until now- 5 hours later.      It's honestly becoming really freaky. He's appearing everywhere I am, always tries to interfere with my life, acts like he owns me. He pretends he doesn't notice my boyfriend and I will catch him staring at me with this really blank look on his face. He's even appeared at my house and asked if I could go to the movies with him, 'just as friends'.      Both my boyfriend and I have tried to confront him, but nothing is working. And every-time I tell him that I do not want anything like friendship between us, he will keep trying harder and become even creepier!      He's appeared in front of my locker after I closed it, appeared at football games I went to, my gymnastics practice, (where i feel really exposed. and the feeling doesn't go away until I have my boyfriend by my side).      I honestly do not know what to do.   And everytime I get a text from this guy in the middle of the night, I feel like barfing and crying at the same time. Im always paranoid that he's watching me, and I get these panic attacks whenever I'm undressing.      I really do not know what to do.   Have any of you been in a similar situation?      He's asked the same question every day.   About 2 days ago he texted me with, "I couldn't concentrate, The aura of your beauty blinded me, What did I miss in Biology?"      It's like I can see him undressing me with his eyes.

I don't formerly hang out with her. But when I see her we have good conversation, flirt, etc. The thing is that she's subtly touching me everytime I am near her. Things include.      -she noticed I worked out and insisted on feeling my back   -I walked by her one time and before we passed she put her hand and grazed my stomach, when I looked back she looked at me and smiled.   -we were at a bar for a Valentine's Event our other friend hosted (we didn't drink) and she grabbed my hand to dance, and after that she grabbed my hand because she wanted to take pictures with me in the photo booth.   -everytime she looks at me she smiles.      I know her enough to know that this isn't common behavior (probably hung out as a group about 10 times). Is she into me? What are signs you girls show that you like a guy?

He acts as a 60 years old(sleeping, laying on the sofa most of the free time) and me, I want to act as 23-24(as we are!). Right now, he is sleeping again, I dont know why he needs to sleep every day during daytime, probably he is old and I didn't notice that. Please help me, I want to entertain myself, but I am new in this town and I can't go anywhere. And its still our honeymoon, I rather go to work. I am so bored and tired, because my husband is like this. He doesn't even want to go to  a shop, he wants to rest, I don't know from what. We don't even have anything to eat. He only wants to sleep, nothing else.

20090220183802AAmxiLn	Family & Relationships;Friends	What is wrong with this guy!?	Okay, so this is the first year that we've talked to each other after knowing each other since the ninth grade (we're now seniors--12th grade) and now we're great friends.. and I was told at the middle of the year by his and my closest guy friends that he liked me.  But it's been awhile, so I don't think he would like me anymore.       Anyway, he's been a real *** to me.  We have two hours of art class together, and he'll always be looking at me and he'll come over 4 or 5 times during one hour and look at my art and say "stop showing off" or "why are you trying to show that off when it sucks so bad?" When I'm not even doing anything and just minding my own business.  I always catch him looking at me .. almost constantly; and he's always making bad remarks about me.        I don't flirt with him, but I constantly am fighting with him.  If I'm talking to another guy he's always like "Oh, you talk to them, but you don't talk to me?"  I try to avoid him because every time we talk it ends up turning into a fight, and he's a good friend..but lately he's been acting like a jerk!        Also, If I talk to another guy, he always tries to get my attention by throwing something at me or poking me or taking something I need or start interrupting me when I'm talking to the other person and he'll start talking to them!  He's like a freakin' grade-schooler.
20090220184833AAFuaMy	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom won't listen to me, advice?	Whenever I need to talk to my mom, she always ends up doing laundry, washing up, folding clothes, straightening her room, and I'm getting real annoyed because it happens every time. I wanted to talk to her about an issue with my dad calling me "stupid" and him needing to ease up on things, and she ignored me! And then she got mad at me for calling my dad by his real name (and he is not my biological father). I tried sitting her down but she just turns on the TV, I tell her she never wants to talk to me, but then she said, "What? You never want to talk to ME!" I feel like ever since she married my new dad 3 years ago, she's been more fascinated with him, than her own daughter! My dad has mood swings a lot, sometimes he thinks I'm his little squirt, but other times he wants to shove me in my room. I recently just lost a family member, my cat Brandon (1/18/09), and I had him since I was 5. I've been crying a lot, But I can't talk to anyone because they don't feel the same way. They tell me that it takes time, and that I should stop making myself suffer by looking at pictures. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel alone, because 1 of my brothers is going to be moving out soon, Maybe in a year or less, and the other one doesn't like to talk to me, he's more interested in his video games.    My dad is always busy and grumpy, and my mom is at work, but when she comes home she doesn't feel like sitting down and talking to me. I understand she might be tired, but I'm talking about her having 2 hours to be relaxed. I really don't know what to do, And my mom said that, When I have an attitude check, then I can come talk to her. So, That will be awhile.      I just feel like once my mom married my new dad, she kind of slipped away. It's been a long time since she's held me, and I know I'm getting older, but I still need her there for me, and I am really having a tough time with the whole situation of me losing my best friend, (my cat).      (BTW: I'm 13.)      I really need some guidance, Obviously my parents are there for me.   P.S: They're goin' to bed right now, so I can't talk to them now.

20090220182028AAfPrlC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need advice on a tricky situation involving online relationships.. :o?	OK I know this girl in real life who plays an internet game called rune scape a lot. She has somehow fallen in love with this guy who's name is Danny. She said that he was a gangster and she knows this because she met him in real life. She cannot do anything anymore but wait for "danny" to log on in rune scape. I doubt she has met this guy in real life but I'm scared she will and he wont be what she expected. I have been trying to talk her out of it but she won't listen. I have talked to danny a little bit on runescape aswell.. He seems to think he is rated 10th in the bloods and can get 20,000 gangsters to come and kill me for trieing to talk her out of it. But he says he is only 14 years old. Any one with common sense can tell that "danny" is completely full of crap but I feel my friend has lost touch with reality and can only think about "danny." I feel this situation could end very badly and I need some good advice on what to do.
20090220183923AA1hdME	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need some guidance and opinions.?	I have been with this guy for a year and a half.  everything was going perfect until one day we were getting ready to leave and his truck wouldn't start. I told him it sounded like the battery was dead. Oh yeah, he is a awesome mechanic.  Anyway he was like No it isn't the battery. I told him again because he was getting upset with it. He yelled at me and said. "I F&*#ING HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY f&#*ING VEHICLES. IT IS NOT THE D*(@ BATTERY" wtf, anyway the battery cable thing that hooks the cable to the battery was bad.  Ever since then we have fought every single day. Well most days anyway. I ended up pregnant w/ my first child and that didn't stop the fighting.  I craved alot of fruits and sweet stuff, and he always complained because he had to go to the store just to get me some yogurt.  We got into it so bad a few times that he told me to leave, and when I would go to get my things and go back to my apartment, he would lock me in his moms house take my car keys and not let me leave. finally i would get outside and start walking. He would be following me begging me to turn back around. I did. It got to the point where he had wished a miscarriage on me like 4 times.  I dunno why I am still with him I think i am scared to leave. I am scared what he will do. He has never physically hurt me on purpose. or at least i dont think it was on purpose. I had to call the cops on him one day because we were at his job and I was talking to one of my friends that he totally hates, and he started his crap with me. I was about 5 months pregnant and he told me "I HOPE YOU AND THE BABY DIES"  anyway, that all has been over 11 months ago.  What does on now  is I am taking online classes and he complains because i dont have time for him.  I also have a 6 month old daughter which I put before my school, but I am taking classes so I can do something with my life and so we can have things in the future.  I am getting tired of his crap. I have a myspace and he don't like any of my friends because we used to go out and drink and have a good time, so he told me that if i didn't take them off of my friends list it was over... This isn't even half of the stuff that goes on.  But to the point.  I dont know how to tell him that I want a divorce. It scares me cuz he is always putting my daughter in the middle and making me feel like crap because he wants to see her every day and how much it will kill him if he couldn't.  he threatens to take me to court, but I have my own apartment and i get money and foodstamps and all that stuff.  I know they wouldnt' take her from me, but I am scared that he might get stupid and try to run with her. What do I do. I really wanna leave, but I am terrified to.

I had been dating this guy for the past 2 and a half months and decided to end it. During that time we got pretty close. My reasoning for ending it is that I wasn't sure that it was the right time for us to be having any kind of dating relationship. He told me from the beginning that he is going through a divorce and is trying to uphold his business. Both of which were putting him under a lot of stress and that he's not ready to be emotionally involved. I became concerned when we were sleeping in the same bed together almost every night and nothing physical was happening and I never felt like he wanted to be affectionate. This was strange for me since I'm used guys being more aggressive. The other problem is that while I was contemplating ending things I went out with another guy for dinner, nothing happened but I figured it would be a way for me to see what else is out there before I decided anything. I never told him about this but did mention the next day that I wanted to keep things open to see other people. During our breakup conversation I slipped and told him about the other guy. He was livid!! He said he is upset that I didn't tell him before I went out with the other guy but after. Since then we have been fighting and he doesn't want to even talk about it! I apologized to him in an email and he txted back saying he accepted it but to not bring it up again. I am really regretting that I did this. Now that 2 weeks have passed since this I feel like if I had never gone out with that guy and had been more patient things could have worked. I just gave up trying to contact him the other day since we have just been going back and forth with this fighting. I want a second chance though. I told him I made a mistake but I don't know if he will forgive me. Im not going to sit around waiting but if I still would like to be with him. Do I stand a chance here? If so how should I go about this ?? Should I call him, drop by his house and talk in person??? He hasnt called or anything since last week. I really just feel like I screwed this up. I haven't had alot of luck with guys and it just feels like such a long waiting game for the right one.
20090220193551AAURPZF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please help me write an apology to an ex-friend?	what do i say? i messed things up and drained my friend. i was constantly literally daily arguing with her to spend her time with me. we go to university together. so, we see each daily almost. my friend got busy and didn't have all that time to now give me. i was such a selfish brat. i started to feel jealous that maybe she has other friends now or a boyfriend and is not tellin me. even, if she was genuinely busy, i would feel maybe she is not busy really and i would annoy her to give me the time. i admit to being insecure, possessive, suspicious and a brat. she walked out on me after giving me chances. i was very hurt but i realize i made the mess. i feel so bad now :(   what do i say in an apology to her? how do i make er know i have really realized how selfish and what a brat i was?   i want to say i was selfish, possessive and a brat. do i also say i felt she had a boyfriend or other friends and would not tell me? i think not right. i tmight look like i am acusing her?

20090220184500AA4DtoV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I still see him on Sunday, PLEASE read and help?	There is this guy I've known since last May and we've been friends. I never contact him, he always contacts me. I told him I liked him 2 months ago and he wasn't very clear with me. I told him again a week ago because he asked me if I was seeing someone and I told him no but I was still crushing on him. He told me that he wasn't dating anybody at the moment because of a very personal issue (I'm one of 3 people that knows about this issue..and it's understandable). He started texting me yesterday and asked me what I was doing on Saturday, I answered and asked him the same question back. He then tells me has a date with this girl that asked him for his number at the mall and also told me that he had low expectations. At this point I'm furious inside and I'm starting to feel stupid. I don't respond to him and he texts me again asking me what I'm doing on Sunday. I said "Who knows." then he says I was wondering if you were interested in going hiking with me Sunday morning" (We haven't seen each other since September). I told him, "Well, let's see how your date goes." Then he says something like "Lol! It's like a job interview, not everyone gets hired" or something like that. I then say "Then what's the point?" and he says "I'm not a hermit. It's like the lotto, you gotta be in it to win it."      Now at this point I want to shoot him and I totally blow him off and say "I can't make it." and he says "Well. I'm still going so if you change your mind let me know."      My friends and I know this guy is interested in me but he is never clear with me. I can't tell if he's trying to make me jealous or he's just being honest. What do you feel about this situation? Should I still see him?

20090220182757AAONI0g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My twin sister shows a lot of cleavage and acts sexy with my friends! WHY?	Okay, so I am a 16-year-old guy. My twins sister usually used to dress modestly until nowadays. She shows a lot of cleavage and acts all sexy whenever my friends comeover. We are really close, we even share a room (our house isn't very big). Whenever my friends come over, she puposefully bends down a lot (so they look down her shirt) and jiggles her boobs around. She is very beautiful and has good size boobs. She is in shape and what not, but I have been very protective of her but I don't know how to tell her that I don't like her doing such things. She sleeps like half naked. Why is she doing this and how can I talk to her about it? HELP!
20090220183040AAcDwP2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get my ex back?	I met this girl on the internet when I was 15. Me and her talked all the time at 9PM everyday to share feelings and love between each other. I loved the way she laughed, i love her cute smile. She is everything to me. She came down and visited often, because her grandparents live in Miami.    This past Valentines Day weekend she admitted to cheating on me. I was devastated. I couldn't eat, sleep or even think straight because of so much anxiety. She decided to tell me after 3 years...   I called her a ton the day we broke up. Since the news was so devastating, I called and texted her alot. She told me that I could be good friends with her, and she would come back to me if things didn't work out with this new guy. I refused and hung up the phone.      A lot of people are telling me to move on, but it's just not the same. I loved this girl so much, that I dedicated 3 years of my life to basically date a virtual woman: it's amazing what love will drag you in to.       Within the next year or so, her parents are going to move to Florida to be closer to their parents. When this happens, any relationship she has will probably be terminated. I live in Florida, and therefore she might come back to me.      Is there any way I could get her back? I can't forgive her for the things she did, but she still wants me to be her friend. How can I be there for her, without nagging her or being irritable or needy?       Moving on is out of question...

20090220183502AAwqmDO	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this unfair to do to a 17-year-old girl?	I have a best friend that never gets to do anything. She's always expected to babysit her younger siblings. And when she's not doing that, she works at the same place her mom is the manager of, so she always gets unreasonable hours. And she has to accept the hours, because she needs the money to pay for things that her mom should get...such as food, etc.      I really wish I could hep her out, but I don't know how. Her mom makes her take care of her one month old baby brother everyday. She dropped out of High School, because of problems in the school, but now she's too busy to even study for her GED, because her Mom won't let her do anything for herself. Is this unfair? And is there anything I can do to help?

20090220184315AAaVVPe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I help myself?	well i'm actually a quiet confident person, but at the same time wen I see this girl (christina) i like I get all nervous and pretend to myself she isn't there, like yesterday we had a swimming carnival and i felt quiet sick after a few races so I sat down to relax and then suddenly i see her a cross from where i was talking to her friends, so i was like looking away to avoid her and there are those times where i no shes looking at me so i just continue to look away. Then a friend of mine came up to me to confort me and she stayed with me, I then felt as though she was hitting on me or something but at the time i didn't really want her near me. So then the girl I liked came up to my friend who was sitting next to me and hugged her. So i had to look at her and smile to not act suspicous. So then after a few minutes I was just staring and thinking and all of a sudden wen i adjusted my eyes I realised I was staring at her.       So then again i looked away. Then like i've been sitting down for like 2 hours watching the races and my friend came up to me and was like " u feeling all right?" (this was a different friend). And i was like not really so she hugged me and i hugged her back and it was like a long hug so i was like u wanna let go of me now? and she was like just a little longer, I haven't seen u since the holidays so i was like ok.. keep in mind that this was a swimming carnival and she was in her bikini.       So more strange things happened wen i was feeling sick so I question is, why are girls hitting on me? And what can I do to get Christina to like me? I know I should talk to her and stuff bu any better way? P.s I got a an all girls private skool and i'm a girl.

20090220185821AATvNW2	Family & Relationships;Family	I don't know how to deal with my sister?	We are both teenagers and I know that siblings do grow apart around this age.  She continues to do things that she knows annoy me.  I have tried telling her to stop - both nicely and rudely - but she just continues.  We fight a lot, in fact we just had a big one.  Each time she runs off crying and then usually accuses our parents of siding with me every time.  She is not even crying because she is hurt - and I really do know this.  She cries when she does not get what she wants.  When we were younger she even used to call me a crybaby.  I spend a lot of time avoiding her by hiding away in my room.  I have looked up questions like this, but I still don't know what to do.  I have tried being nice and treating her with respect, but nothing works.  I used  to be the quiet one in the family; I copied everything she did.  I have learned to be my own person now, but I think she got used to the old me when I would do whatever she said.  I just want her to treat me with the same respect that I try to treat her.  I have read other questions where people answered saying that things will get better when we are older, but I want to go back to the feeling of being best friends like when we are younger, but I am definitely not going back to the old and meek me.  Please help me!  I am sure someone must have a sibling like this too!

20090220191606AAmC78T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please give me some advice about my marriage/wife?	I've been married 21 years. I have 3 kids. I've got 2 boys 9 and 13 and a daughter that is 19 still at home. About 3 weeks ago I left. Let me back up. Early on in our marriage up until about 8 years ago my wife claims that my family (sisters and mom) mistreated her. She claims that they made fun of her, lied on her, stabbed her in the back. I did notice my sisters being bitches to her. I've had to get on to them a couple of times... My mother. I never really seen my mother mistreat her, but my wife said she did. Well, eventually my wife cut them out of her life (except for my mom) and asked me to please stand up for her. I did and I cut them off too. Well, my mom has been riding me to have a relationship with my other family members again and I keep telling her not until they apologize to my wife for threatening her and harassing her via email. They say that they don't owe my wife an apology. Well, the other night I was telling my wife about my sister being sick and she blew up. She said she didn't care. She called me a sorry SOB, said she hated me... I left. I've been gone for 3 weeks. There were other problems too. I've got a temper and sometimes the kids and my wife make me angry. Sometimes I yell and scream. I have called my boys retards on many occasions and I've been known to call them all pigs if the house isn't picked up. I haven't gotten physically abusive with her in a long while... Anyway, she sent me a text today saying that I was abusive for 21 years and that she's not letting the boys go anywhere with me. She also said that she WILL NEVER let my boys have anything to do with my family because of the way they've treated her. I guess she's afraid they'll try and talk bad about her to the kids. My daughter won't answer my calls. My daughter says that her mom has had to put up with my abuse for 21 years and that I shouldn't expect her mom to put up with my family's abuse and that I should not go around those family members. I just need some input here. My wife called me, asked me to come home, but I hung up on her. We've been through a lot of hard times... What do you all think I should do? This woman told me she hated me, wished I was dead, called me a sorry SOB... I'm sick of it.

20090220192432AAGDaIz	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do?? Please help?	About 5 hours ago, my dad came over to my place (right down the road). He was on his way to meet my mom at my sister's house and said he wanted to stop by to give me the garden gnome I left when I moved out. He said my mom told him to give it to me, which I just found out she never did. My dad isn't a very emotional person. Usually, he keeps it all to himself. So when he started telling me he is proud of me and loves me no matter what, it seemed a little odd. I decided to let it go as stress and needing to 'get it all out'. He seemed very reluctant to leave, but finally he did. Well, about a 1/2 hour ago, my mom called to tell me my dad never showed up. This in itself would be enough to worry without the fact that he hates his job and is going through a bankruptcy. Also, my dad has had 3 best friends. All of them have committed suicide. One was 20 yrs ago, one was 2 yrs ago, and one was 5 months ago. We live in Michigan and the roads are really bad, so he could've gotten in a wreck. My mom asked me to drive down to their house and see if he was there for some reason. He wasn't, but the door to the house was unlocked. My dad is really anal about locking doors and things. If we go out to eat, we have to sit so we can see the car. Sorry for this long description. but I'm freaking out and will someone give me some advice, please?

20090220192734AASunkV	Family & Relationships;Friends	I moved away for college and I'm starting to get lonely. How can i make friends?	I moved far away for college. I have been here for 6 months. At first I met a lot of people and made a close group of friends. They are 3 boys, I am a girl. Lately, they don't call me to hang out with them when they do "guy" things like play poker. They even do homework and stuff together. I only hang out with them once a week, when I used to hang out with them like 3 days a week. I see them everyday in class but they don't talk to me as much as they used to. they have their own guy group now. They got another guy friend in their group now and I feel like he replaced me.       I have met many people at school, and while I get along with them all I don't click with them. I need to find other social groups so I do not get lonely. How can I make more friends? Where can I meet them?
20090220192948AAw6rhS	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I live with my boyfriend after dating for a year, even though my mom pays the rent?	My mom, dad, and I pay the rent three ways.  My boyfriend is going to medical school next year and needs a place to stay.  If he were to live with me my parents would only have to pay $175 instead of $260.  Plus, we spend just as much time together now than if we were living together.  I sleep at his house every night, half my clothes are at his place, and we haven't been away from each other more than two days in the last month and a half.  Should I tell my mom or ask? Do you think she'll have a problem with it? I'll be 21 and a senior in college. And she lived with my dad before they got married!!! What should I do????

It said "I am going crazy thinking about you, I can't wait to c u, I hate that you have a man, I always have"  When I confronted him he said that since me and him had grown distant he needed companionship and it was just a cell phone thing, he never messed with her physically, is said he was just messing with her mind. Is he lying? Is he a cheater? Oh yeah, he did call her in front of me and told her he didn't give a dam about her and he love his wife. Is he full of it or what?

It was kinda awkward...cus he was with all of his friends that I didn't know, and I was intimatated. SO when we actually were talking his friend leaves and mouths ill go. So then my friends were freaking out and I think they ruined it. He is REALLY nice and I REALLY like him but he is so weird around his friends. Not to mention he just totally makes fun of me around them and his friends make fun of me to. Are they like bugging him about liking me? Or does he ACTUALLY like me? I am CONFUZZLED!! O and I was a whimp cus I was scared to talk to him cus all his friends would do was be jerks to me and quite frankly IT WAS PISSING ME OFF.
20090220194850AA4HxAm	Family & Relationships;Friends	I hate my "best friend"?	So I have this "friend." We've been friends for almost 6 years and things went smoothly up until a year ago when she suddenly turned into a *****. She goes after ALL of the guys I like, every one of them. And I have no idea why she does it.       Also, I had recently broke up with my boyfriend and I had suspected that she had started to see him behind my back. She denied it and said she never talks to him but I saw them both at the mall today. I'm just getting really sick of her doing things like this. I'm starting to think she does this on purpose just to hurt me.       Part of me wants to drop her on her butt and make better friends but the other half of me feels compelled to forgive her (like I usually do.) But I feel that I have been way too forgiving and that it needs to change. What should I do?      It's not just guy related things she does that annoy me. She never comforts me when I'm upset, only kicks me when I'm down. Always finds a way to put me down when I'm in a good mood, and I think she talks about me behind my back. It really isn't fair because I'm a good friend to her.      Help!!!
20090220194935AAGfs0S	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband terminating rights- child support question?	My husband hasn't seen his two kids from his first marriage in 4 years thanks to his ex making it impossible, he pays child support thru support enforcement which started when the amount of what we paid changed it automatically started to come out that way. Anyways I have 2 questions. 1, he is in iraq and signed and had the papers notarized and send agreeing for the termination and allowing her current husband to adopt the kids. first question is, are we somehow going to have to continue to pay child support still? Or does that stop since the husband is adopting them? Second, if it stops, how soon til the support enforcement will quit the garnishment. We've never been behind-so if we overpay, i dont know how we'll get it back either. just curious. the court date is in the beginning of march. please help, thanks!

I can't stop worrying that my boyfriend will be dishonest or cheat. he has given me NO reason to fear that he will. he has been nothing but honest and true. but i can't stop these horrible thoughts of it happening. he does everything to prove he wont. he gave me his paswords to his cell records and e-mail. he sends me pics and videos. this has been going on for 8 months now and i still have trust issues. he tells me he poors his sweat and blood into this relationshp to prove he wont ever cheat but it hasnt payed off. he told me that he will never cheat and i will never push him into cheating. should i believe him? or will my constant questioning eventually (if not already) push him to cheat?
20090203103320AAhsYCs	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I Have A Problem & I Don't Know What 2 Do About It?	We've been sleeping with each other for almost 2months now. He didn't tell me he had a gf until a few weeks ago, but we're still each other and we're becoming closer than we intended, and now our mutual friends are suspecting that we're messing around because when we are around each other we can't keep our hands off of one another.   However, he says that I'm about to become a problem he said he can see it coming & may have to ease up on me because I'm starting to act mad. Like he won't tell me what he does for a living & he's hardly on time when he says he will. I don't know why he thinks I'm at about to become a problem for him because the way I see it I'm more of a problem to myself. I think we both know we should walk away but we're becoming attached and addicted to how we make each other feel. He lies and sneaks off on his gf and sometimes she calls him consistently when we're together. But he does that because he doesn't want to lose me. So what do I do about it? I'm not his problem he's mine and I don't know what to do about it? I know people will say just leave him alone because he's not going to leave me alone, he's just saying those things to me to keep me in my place.   I told him from now on I'm going to keep my distance from him at the parties & he told me to stop talking crazy.   Well if he thinks I'm about to become a problem isn't that obviously what he wants?

Okay,[I'm bi and 13] i'm wondering if my girlfriend really likes me... or how much she likes me... we went to a school dance, and she wouldn't dance[she kept saying she couldn't dance]... except we held hands a lot during the whole two hours we were there. I tried to motivate her to dance, but she wouldn't so i had to flirt a little to get her to move her arms... before i left i told her i loved her and hugged her tight, she said she loved me back... so how much do you think she likes me? Thanks everyone who answers!
20090220221936AAKmENM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I cried today because these guys were screwing with me? (Long story)?	Okay, today was the last day of camp. Usually, I don't care when people tease me cuz I get teased every day, so I'm used to it. But seriously, they went overboard. Calling me "Vagina man!" and stuff. And then talking sh.i.t about me in my face. Annoying, annoying, annoying.       I felt my anger rising over, and kept breathing really hard. They threw snow at me and pushed me around. Soon, I got so pissed I shouted, "SCREW THIS!" and threw my floor mat. I started yelling and the three guys and started bawling.      A group of people (in my hiking group) surrounded me, comforting me and telling me that it was okay. Then this girl started yelling at them and pushing them and throwing snow at them.      Now I'm scared to go back to school on Monday because one of the guys who pushed me over the top was spreading a rumor that I cried because he threw a snowball at me, and it had a stick in it. I was so mad!      I don't know what to do. I told them to stay the hell away from me. Of course, they didn't listen. On the plus side, I have a great way of making people feel horrible, and that's what I did to all of them.      But I'm afraid people will tease me, especially the boys because the guys hate me and I hate the guys. (Even though I am one :P). What do I do to ignore the teasing? I'm afraid I'll just get really mad again and cry, which I don't wanna do.

20090203104546AAjZIkR	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom can't stand me. I feel like a bad person. What should I do?	I'm 22 years old. I don't have enough money yet to move out of my mom's house and won't be able to until next year. My mom seems to be in a depression (she has thyroid problems). At least she seems to be depressed. She hasn't been diagnosed but she is not a happy person at all. She always takes little things out on me. She yells at me for the least little thing. For example, I helped my dad on a plumbing job he was working on. I accidentally left one of his tools on the job and she yelled at me. I feel like she hates me. She doesn't yell at my brother like this. Not sure why my mom has such a problem with me. I'm very respectful, I don't party and am always home when I should be. I even go to church with her every Sunday and help out around the house vacuuming, dusting, cutting grass, etc. Nothing ever seems good enough though. I finally snapped yesterday and told her I was tired of the way she's treating me. I'm desperately searching for a job that pays more than minimum wage so I can live on my own but I haven't had any luck so far. What should I do to makes things better?
20090203101057AA8KTAg	Family & Relationships;Family	I think I'm a bad influence on my nephew.  What do I do?	So I'm 24 and have a 15 year old nephew.  My sister had him when she was a teenager and he doesn't have a dad around.  I'm kind of like a big brother/dad to him ... I've taught him to hunt and fish and work on cars.      Problem is lately he started drinking and smoking and skipping school.  I did all these things in high school, and I still drink and smoke all the time ... I'm pretty nice looking and was always considered cool.  Problem is I've also never been to college except for a few community college classes and I live in a mobile home and sell used cars.  My nephew is smart and I'd like to see him be like a doctor or a lawyer or something.  I guess this all makes me a hypocrite, but I don't know ... what am I supposed to do?

We are both females. We are very compatiable because I have ALWAYS pertained to older people (in relationships and friendships alike) and she is "young at heart".

Okay, so my best friend Christina is in a fight with my other best friend Molly. Christina's phone got taken away by her mother and she needs to talk to her boyfriend so she asked molly, but then molly totally flipped saying that christina was using her and that christina is a bad friend and totally trashing her to my face. She told me to tell that to christina. Then christina did the same thing. But hers was legit trashing, im not saying that trashing molly was good.       What should I do because I'm in the middle, and molly wants me on her side but I know Christina is a better friend. I'm not on any ones side.      Then Molly calls me and says all this crap about christina's boyfriend, but its not true. Shes trying to get them to break up because shes mad. And shes saying REALLY mean things that aren't appropriate to type. And I'm confused. I'm just ranting, because I need to.            Just give me advice, on what to do. And stuff. No mean things please! I don't need that right now. Maybe later you can tell me how dumb this question is! :D

20090203104104AAnTSOH	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do about a friend/cousin who won't listen?	My cousin (who also happens to be my best friend) has really had a rough year.  Her husband of 6 months left her (that was a bad relationship, that should have never turned into marriage anyway he was physically, and emotionally abusing), she had a nervous breakdown, lost the apartment she was living in, lost her job, left to raise 3 kids with no help from their father and numerous other things.  For the 6+ months her ex has not helped her in any way with money or just support. He was to busy being with his girlfriend (which is the reason he left) and his friends to even call his kids.  A few weeks ago he lost his job and now because he has no money, and no one wants to hang out with him (because he has no money or car) he wants to come around to "spend time with the kids".    I understand the kids need to see their father and I agree, but she goes above and beyond for him.  She takes himout to look for jobs, she takes the him and the kids out (he has no money so she pays).  When he lost his ID she took him to get a new one.  But when she had no money to get oil in her house to have heat I gave her the $, when the boiler was broken and needed to be repalced, she stayed at my house for a week until she had heat.    It is hard for me to say no because I love her 3 kids as if they were my own, and and I would do anythign for them.  And at heart she is just a kind person who lets people walk all over her, but I am at my wits end. How can you help someone if they can't even help themselves?

20090203095435AAjQopR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I break up with her?	I recently began dating a girl from home - we're both in college now. We've only been going out for like a month, but we both have felt like we should have been going out for much longer than that, and I think the feelings between us are genuinely love.      However, I just got into a huge fight with her last night over the distance issue. She goes to a community college at home, while I go to a private college a thousand miles away. She's been hinting that I should transfer to be closer to her, but finally asked me to transfer straight out last night. I really don't want to, so I said no, and it just went downhill from there. She obviously feels like I don't value the relationship, but I told her no reason at all could possibly make me transfer, even her.      I don't know what to do about this. I almost feel like if she's gonna be like this, then I don't want to be with her. I'm seriously considering breaking up with her over this. She clearly doesn't respect my decision not to transfer, and I honestly don't think she can handle being without me. She spends her nights at home while I'm gone drinking herself to sleep. She's also being a burden on my social life here - she expects me to talk to her almost constantly, to the point where it is difficult to do anything else with my friends here at college. I think the problem is that she's madly in love with me, but I'm don't feel as strongly about her, and she seems to be a really clingy person, to the point where she literally needs to have someone else to cling to in order to get by, and she's picked me, but I'm not actually there so she's breaking down.      What do you think I should do?
20090220220621AAr5zS5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Told him to stop but he still doesn't?	Ok this married man in my neighborhood had been acting strange and giving me stares out of the windows of his car and moving his head 90 degrees to look at me without even concentrating on the road. I had to tell his friend that he needs to stop and i didn't like it at all. After his friend told him to stay away. I still sometimes notice him doing the same thing, like yesterday he was on his bike and i was with my brother and then again while driving his bike he moved his head to look at me.      I really don't know how to behave now because i thought the warning would scare him off and i wont have to deal with him again, but he is just does not move back. He even does that when i am with my brother, though i have not told my brother, seems like he isn't scared. Now what do i do with this creep?
20090203102908AAJG8Y2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think my ex still like me?	My ex boyfriend broke up with me about 3 months ago, we were together for 8 months. We are still in high school. When he ended our relationship he said it was because he felt like he shouldn't be with anyone right now. He told me he still thought I was an amazing person though.   We recently went on a school trip together and we talked a lot which was different then what I was used to because before it was awkward when we would see each other. When we were unloading the van he hits me with his pillow and we start play fighting.   He also kept staring at me and when he said that I was "really cool."   The day after we get back he starts texting me too.      I still have very strong feelings for him and am extremely happy we are talking again.         does it sound like he still likes me? can you decifer any of this?      thnx
20090220223953AAh8oWB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help me!!! I'm going out in like 30 mins with some older kids?	Okay so I moved to the Philippines like 5 yrs ago and I went to this Christian school that I hated.. but I made a couple of older friends and one of my friends left to Australia and now she's back and so I'm going out to meet her in like 30 mins.

My friend bailed out on me to come along like she always does and none of my friends know the girl from Auss, soo.. what do I do?? I'm really scared to go alone with the girl from Auss whom I know and her two friends who I know also but never really talked to them.      Keep in mind I don't want to be out of place. Helppp!!!

20090203101432AAICa2U	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How would you ask this?	I have been dating someone long-distance for a year. I live in Michigan, them in North Carolina. I decided to move down there and recently put my house on the market (planning on at least 6-12 months on the market to finalize my plans). When we first started discussing it, it seemed like he wanted me to move in with him (saying he would check out the schools in his district for my son, etc), but I didn't want to. I thought it would be better to get my own place, at least for a couple months. So I casually started bringing up looking at apartments and such. Well...now I changed my mind. Financially I won't be able to afford to pay several months rent up front (moving without a job in line, I would need to) and pay to move that far away. Also, since the decision was made, it has brought a new level of intimacy to our relationship, and now I truly want to live with him. But now the only way it's feasible is for me to move in with him. I hinted a little that financially I didn't know how I would manage, but he hasn't offered for me to move in with him, and I don't want to just put him on the spot with a question like that. How do I ask, without asking so to speak?

20090203104715AAO4lvP	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Ideas to entertain guests after ceremony while I take my pictures?	I know for most weddings you have the ceremony at the church at noon or something and then the reception is around 5pm somewhere else...i think its weird for people to go home after the church and then come back for the reception..but that's a choice some people make and I think it gives the bride and groom time to take their formal pictures...anyway      the thing is im having a small wedding, 20ppl max, no bridesmaids..just family and close friends...the ceremony will be at this little japanese house in a botanic garden..the reception will be at the same location..(this place is a little bit out of town) so i think it would not make sense to tell people to come back in 2 hours for dinner...while i take my pictures at the garden...   any ideas on what to do, or how to schedule things so that people dont get bored and i get enough time to do my pics...? SHould I make a program for such small event?   thanks
20090203104057AABsmkg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I propose this idea to my ex-boyfriend?	So we used to see each other naked all the time (never had sex) and then he dumped me without giving me any reason or explanation. 6 months later, he begins to miss me and he feel guility for the way he ended things. I decided I won't forgive him unless he lets me get him drunk one day while he's at my house, so that I can ask him questions that he will answer honestly because he's too drunk to lie. That's the condition for me "forigving him" since he called me a "stalker" after I tried to get him to talk to me again and was so cold and hostile towards me after the whole incident.

20090220223156AACgYlR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a really big crush on this guy!!!?	So, here's the story. At my sisters wedding, my sisters friend thought I was really cute and we started talking and stuff. He lives 4 hours away though so nothing really happened. Recently (about 3 and a half months later), my sister was talking to me and said that he was single again and wanted me to start talking with him again. She's been wanting me to date him for a while even though he is 5 years older than me (I'm 19, he's 24). So I started messaging him on facebook and he really seemed happy to talk to me, but I didn't want to be like.."HEY, I like you...let's date." And he seems like the kind of guy that is kind of shy and doesn't want to start the convo. Even on facebook chat, he doesn't say anything unless I message him first and it almost makes me feel like I'm desperate. I really like this guy, but I don't know how I should go about getting closer to him since he is so far away. I'm just frustrated and am really ready for a relationship (but am afraid of rejection). Do you have any good advice for me? I would really appreciate it.

20090220213829AABUVOb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she flaunting herself? Why?	I was looking at some of the pictures on display in the classroom and this girl which is my friend since we met about 6 months ago came up to me and said hi and asked me what I was doing and stuff. So we were alone in the room and she starts leaning on the table and tilting her behind up. I got kind of distracted and tripped over her leg, and she started smiling. This other time she was telling me how tight her jeans were and so she started to stretch in front of me basically. She also put her legs on the table when we talked, but I think she only did that because she got new boots. I'm not complaining, but I just want your take on this.
20090220210641AAjh5rn	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I ruin his life?	Today I was assaulted by an 18 year old senior in my school.   I say assault because I'm 16, he's 18, and I didn't retaliate.      It was a sucker punch to the face causing my cheek to bruise and my mouth to bleed.      Normally I would want to fight back, but this kid benches 450.      Anyway, I spoke with a police officer about this issue, as required by school policy. He has a 2 week suspension, and is facing criminal charges pressed by the school.      In the mean time, the cop recommends I get a PPO or restraining order against him. However, due to the size of our school , this would mean he would be removed from the district. Also he wishes to go into the military after high school, and the PPO would put him on the military "black list".       So his future rests in my hands, and I'm not sure to follow through with it or not.      NOTE:   He has shown no form of remorse.   He has not spoken with me.   This is not the first physical attack.

20090203101627AATzxmX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Boyfriend more important than best friend?	Ok  here is the story i have a best friend, we have been friends for 4 years now or something.      She just got a new boyfriend they been together only 3 weeks and she's already acting like she can't live without him.   Like on msn she won't even reply to me because she'll be too busy talking to him and it's really annoying. If she writes back to me she only writes "yh" "kk" or no or something like that, she replies really short the only time she really says more is when she talks about her boyfriend.       That's really bothering me.      At the moment she went over to her country for a while, kind of an emergency and she even told me she misses her boyfriend more than me.       She told me she would never let a guy come in between us and that she would never put a guy in front of me ... and look whats happening now after just 3 weeks.       Now that shes away she hardly writes back to me on msn or bebo because she keeps taking to him on skype and bebo.    It's really annoying.       I don't know if it's normal or not but I think it's over the top. They are together only 3 weeks and they're telling each other they are madly in love and they can't live without each other, there never gonna let each other go and all that .. blah blah blah .. u know the type of thing I'm on about right?      Can anyone give me advice on this?

20090221005731AAYlD8Z	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	When you love your babys father but he doesnt love you anymore?	Like is it possible to love someone and hate them at the same time? I mean I love my sons father. But he hurt me really bad, he moved in with another woman while I was pregnant, he played so many mind games with me. He has been tellin me he loves me and wants me back but it will be a while before he moves out of his girlfriends house. So I asked him last night who is heart really belonged to and he told me he couldnt answer that. Obviously it doesnt really belong to me, it belongs to her. Our son is 2 months old now and he took our son for the first time last night cuz I had to work and he was gonna babysit, and soon as we parted ways he bacame a complete d*ck to me and wouldnt even tell me how he was doing when I asked. Like I am so tired of his games and being hurt, but I love him, and not only becuz he is my sons father, there are other reasons too. But I told him today that I was done, that he needed to stay with his other family (she has 2 kids that arent his, but none by him). I'm just so hurt. What do I do? I am really almost to that point where I litterally get sick to my stomach when I even think about him or see him. I have to deal with him for the next 18 years, but I almost want to hate him. How do I deal with this?

20090220200306AA5kTQ7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will I ever hear from him again?	Recently my boyfriend of 3 months broke up with me. We'd been having a rough spot and I told him I needed some space and he went and met another girl on me. I had no idea but hed been seeing her behind my back for a month. He dropped me like a bad habbit with no regrets. No idea how he could do it! How do I make him regret it??!?! and get my strength back?? I've lost 10 pounds over him....and I feel like I was deeply in love. I woulda married him, if he wasnt such an asshole....what if he tries to ever call me again? what would I say?or do? I was warned about him on our first date that he never settles for long..but things seemed to be going well..now hes with this other hoochie and I have no idea why shes so great I heard she isnt that pretty even. Sure things were going in the shitter with us but that was cuz of him...I knew that things probly wouldnt get better with us but I thought we could at least be friends, and he wouldnt move on SO FAST!!!!??!?!?Do u think I'll ever hear from him again?

20090203102017AAAgPMl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Trying to mess things up?	so i've been involved with this guy since October. we were introduced to each other by a mutual friend, "jim". but recently i found out that jim has been telling him stuff about me...like stuff about my past...jim and i were apart of this group which consisted of a couple of guys and me. long story short, at different points (as in never at the same time), i was "friends with benefits" with 2 guys in the group except for jim. jim took it upon himself to tell this guy i've been seeing about this as well as the story about how things are "awkward" between me and one of his roommates. i felt like none of that was his business to tell my beau. and to make things worse, one night my beau and i were going out on a date and right before he went out, jim called him and asked him to hang out with him and this other guy....this other guy being a former "friend with benefits" of mine. comments?

20090220215633AAiw41y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I just let go and enjoy myself and make sure she does too??   [Kinda Graphic]?	Tonight, my gf and I went to the movies, and afterwards we went to a random spot and parked the car and got in the back and started making out.       After awhile, I went up her shirt, and after that, I unbuttoned her pants and started fingering her. She was breathing pretty heavy after awhile and she was making alot of moaning sounds. I was just rubbing the outside for about 5 minutes, and then went in, and found the top of her where it was sponge like[heard tht thats the gspot]   and i went kinda faster rubbing it and she got really intense and started clenching my back after awhile. Then, id gently rub the outside and surprise her randomly with 2 fingers, and go in really deep and she was moaning really loud and dug her nails in my back.  After doing tht awhile we stopped and we just kissed and i tryed to again and she said no. so we kept kissing, then she tilted her head back and i started kissing her neck, and she pushed me down to her boobs, and i lifted her shirt and yea... use ur imagination, and she was really liking tht, and after awhile of doing tht i fingered her while I was doing tht and she was going crazy, and i randomly moved my fingers around and she told me right there, and i sped up really fast and alternated kissing her neck, etc. and then she told me to stop after tht, but she sounded really relieved so i think I made her ***, but im not sure becuz its only my second time ever doing tht.   <- she told me not to/to stop atleast 3 times the entire almost 2 hours we were out there.         Why was she telling me not to towards the beginning of this? Had i already made her *** that time or wat?         And, I have never gotten head before, and I know she'd be willing to, but I dont know how to get her too. And im self conscious and I cant seem to get very hard sometimes unless shes like moaning loud in my ear.         <Afterwards we joked around alot, and she seemed like she was out of it, and kinda loopy, wats that mean??      were both 16.  were both virgins, but she has done pretty much everything else.      And girls, why wouldnt she let me pull her underwear down? Maybe thinking i was trying to get more or what? She made me put my hand under it and i got sore/hand tired really quick

20090220220237AA1HyBX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you ask a girl out?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i've fallen in love with my friend. I fell in love with her the second i saw her 3 years ago. She is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and she's really smart. Whenever I see her I get weak at the knees & get butterflies in my stomach. She takes my breath away and whenever i see her i feel like i have to use all my strength to keep myself from kissing her. I lose all rational thought when I see her. We're in math class together and i can't keep my eyes off of her. Seeing her is the best part of my day. I've tried to ask her out but i freeze up every time. I've tried to ask her out everyday for the last 3 years. I've even tried doing it over the phone but I just freeze up when I try to ask her. I'm trying so hard to ask her but I just can't do it and its driving me crazy. She would be the perfect girlfriend/wife. I love everything about her & when ever i see her i always get lost in her eyes. I just cant resist that look in her eyes. and it so cute when she plays with her hair. I think she might like me but i'm not sure she keeps telling me that i'm really smart and she tells all of her friends and her parents that too. and sometimes she teases me and she just asked me if i would come to her soccer games. and we've been studying together every week for math. and she said that she likes how i'm always there for her. I really want to be with her. I would b a good bf. I would adore her and shower her with kisses all the time. Her kiss has to be like heaven. I've fallen in love with her and I want to marry her. My life would be perfect if i had her. Meeting her was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I think about her day & night. my grades are slipping b/c i'm constantly daydreaming about her in class. not being able to ask her out is driving me crazy. And whats even worse is that she is going out of state for college. I know I have to ask her but I can't get the words to come out. Not knowing if she wants me is unbearable but I can't get myself to just ask her. I just can't stop thinking about her. I know that she is my true love and soul mate I just know it. I have to have her. She's the first girl I've ever liked or even had a crush on. I wish she knew how much I love her. It's just so hard to ask her out and I need to know how. How do you ask a girl out?

He attempted to pacify a conflict from breaking off a relationship by sending an email. Followed by 6 more.   First blaming, then to justify, long stories, next, tried to find a solution, then last email, decided to call it quits.    The other party replied once, only after the last email.

20090203100448AAHeY0T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who should make the move for the first kiss - him or me?	This guy and I have been getting to know one another since October. On the 24th of January we finally decided that we wanted to be in a relationship instead of just getting to know one another. Part of the reason that we decided to take it so slow was because I have issues with intimacy, in past relationships I've always gotten scared as soon as the word intimacy has gotten involved. With him, though, it's different. I love being close to him, snuggling on his couch, holding hands, hugging, yeah. The only problem is everything that we have done as been initiated by me. One time we were driving home from dinner with a guy at our church and I grabbed his hand for a few seconds. He started talking out loud. "She just grabbed my hand. Does this mean I can hold hers?" and later on I told him that he didn't have to ask, he could just do. He said he didn't want to do anything that made me uncomfortable. Honestly? I'm comfortable. I want to kiss him but I'm wondering who should make the move - him or me? I have a feeling that if I wait for him, it'll be a really long time because he's so afraid of making me feel uncomfortable. Also, if I should make the move, should I do it while we are alone in his apartment or when he's walking me to my car?

20090203104119AAWkMN3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to strengthen a relationship?	me and my boyfriend have been dating for 2 years this month. we both love each other a lot, and this is our first serious relationship. he's in his first year of college and im graduating this spring. we plan to move together and go to college together this summer, and we've planned that for around a year now. the only problem is that lately our fighting has been getting in the way. we know that we love each other and we always get back together, but lately our fights have gotten physical. he's hit me, and im not gunna lie.. ive done it back. i know that we love each other, but we cant find the ways to make it better. last night is the worst fight we've gotten in so far, and he told me that he doesnt want to date me anymore... and then today he said he does but wants us to get better. we've tried that over and over, but it never works. i need advice on how to strengthen our relationship. i feel like besides the fighting, we're an awesome couple. i just know that my issues are that i get way to emotional. i cry A LOT. and i can admit that i may seem needy. but he doesnt show any emotion or love. i can understand that he doesnt want to kiss in public, but when we're alone.. he still has issues about it. its hard for me to feel loved by someone that doesnt show it physically or emotionally.      i just know that we really need help to save this relationship... i know we love each other and are worth it, but i dont know how we can show that or what we should say to make our love more important than the stupid fights.      thanks=]

20090203103000AA3EdbF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Sexual question...looking for girls to answer!?	Ok basically here is my issue. When my wife was home we had sex alot but only when she wanted to. There would be times she would be laying on my bed and she would be just all fine and dandy and I had just gotten out of the shower. At one point in time I walked over to the bed, dropped my towel, got on top of her and started making out with her while moving my hips around and pressing myself against her crotchal region. I did this for like three minutes and then I sat up. She asked me to move because she couldn't see the TV. She wasn't wet or anything. No reaction whatsoever. This happened quite a few times. And usually when we had sex it was fast and done with in like two minutes. I could never get her wet. I even went down on her a few times and nothing happened. When I asked her why I couldn't get her wet she got all pissy with me. But when she wanted to have sex she got wet just fine. So heres my question...WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON??? Do I not turn her on? Is she grossed out by me? HELP!

20090220215539AA41gNX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? please (ten pts1!)?	so i've know this guy for such a long time ( four years) and we've always had this flirty relationship, but he is one of my best friends. i likes him so much three years ago, but he wasn't ready and i honestly don't know if he liked me. so i tried to move on and ended up dating someone for a few months but would constantly be thinking about the other guy. i ended up breaking up with my boyfriend because it just wasn't working, but the whole time i was dating that guy the one who i had liked for a while became extremely flirty.       anyways about a year and a half ago we were both single and were basically best friends but i always had a thing for him. we were such flirts, but he is a flirt too. everyone would tell me that we would be soo cute together, and i think so too.       im so comfortable around him, and im probably more comfortable around him than anyone else. we don't really talk at school because we hangout with different groups and he is always flirting with other girls. this year we never really talk anymore but i feel a connection between him and i, but could that just be a really good friendship connection?    he always has girls hugging him and hes always putting his arm around them, and we used to be like that, but we aren't anymmore. its getting to be almost awkward sometimes.     the other day we hungout and were home alone and nothing happened. mean he put his arm around me and sat on me but nothing else. but it was how everything used to be and our friendship built, but then well go two weeks barely talking and it will suffer again   . im close with his family and he's close with mine and i really think i do like him, but i just don't know how he fills. i mean is he interested in me? i really don't know , what do you think? i don't wanna make a move and him be like uhh were just friends, because that would ruin this amazing friendship. i just don't know. im soo picking with guys its crazy, thats why ive had so few relationships, and because i compare every guy to him, he just seems perfect for me and everyone agrees.   i have no idea, please help. does he like me? what should i do ?   oh yeah and im 16

I sent him some chocolate via the internal mail service on the valentine's day but I didn't have the guts to leave my name. So I just wrote "SA" on the envelope (I didn't want to leave it blank as I didn't want the delivery guy to ask who sent it). My friend said she would find it creepy to get chocolate from an incognito. What would you think if you were that manager? Would you think I'm a creepy stalker type?       I often wonder if he dared to eat my chocolate.

20090220222052AATC61Q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Extremely shy with guys?	Ok this might be a bit long so bare with me.   So all throughout junior high and high school I never had a boyfriend, and then I came to realize, I don't even talk to guys. I'm totally fine with girls, I can go up to a random girl and start talking but I'm absolutely terrified of guys! The reason is pretty dumb too. Through junior high and high school the boys I've encountered were rude, immature, and hurtful. They made my life terrible. They constantly made fun of me and picked on me. I lost all my confidence and whenever a guy would start talking to me I expected something rude and hurtful to come out of their mouths. So now here I am a senior in high school no boyfriends or even just guys that are friends. When guys talk to me I freeze up and can't say anything, when something does come out of my mouth its stupid and I feel like an idiot after wards. So my question is, how can I be confident talking to guys and not freeze up all time? I get disappointed in myself that I let a bunch of immature guys from junior high and early high school break me down so bad that I'm scared to have a conversation with guys.

20090220204102AA0nEve	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What happened to common sense?	Some of the people on here ask the stupidest questions.  Do you really need to ask if cheating is wrong?   cheat     Pronunciation: \?chēt\    1: to deprive of something valuable by the use of deceit or fraud   2: to influence or lead by deceit, trick, or artifice   3: to elude or thwart by or as if by outwitting     intransitive verb   1 a: to practice fraud or trickery b: to violate rules dishonestly       2: to be sexually unfaithful —usually used with on    Really people, let's get it together.  I mean I understand if you want peoples opinions ... but it wouldn't hurt some of y'all to think a little before you post.  And I really don't care if I wasted 5 points to say all this.  It's ridiculous.  Some of y'all have no respect for yourselves or the people around you and that blows my mind.  Am I the only one that feels like this?
20090220214225AAO8HjC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to do about my boyfriend!?	I have been going out with my boyfriend for about a month now but I have liked him way before he asked me out...well I am doing a sermon at my local church. It is the first time I am going to speak publicly and it means a great deal to me and I really want him to come because it means so much to me. But when I asked him if he was coming this past week (keep in mind that it is about a week in advance and this is not new information to him) he said and I quote "I'll probably be sleeping in on that day." This really hurt my feelings and it has bothered me ever since. It has even distracted me so much that I cant concentrate on working on my sermon...I really like him and have texted him how I feel about him not coming but he hasn't answered me back...I have no idea what I should do about this...one of my friends said that I should break up with him I actually though about just because it means so much to me and to me it seems like he doesn't care...anyway please any advice would be nice thanks SO much...
20090220202850AAgpWVB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he like me...?	OK...so there is this guy that I really, really like!!  The only problem is telling if he really likes me back.  We sit next to eachother in history class and he used to try and take things out of my pockets, tell random jokes, and always get me to laugh (even when he was still with his girlfriend).  About a week ago he broke up with his girlfriend, at first he was kind of moody towards me (and everyone in general) and I thought he didnt like me (at the time i didnt know he and his gf broke up), now he is flirting with me EVEN more.  I'm afraid however, since I get straight A's, that maybe he only wants to get close to me to cheat off tests and stuff.  I really hope this isnt true, and I'm pretty positive it isn't...anyway how do I get him to ask me out??  I'm pretty shy with these things and don't want to seem like a loser in case he doesn't like me, therefore I DON'T want to ask him out myself.  What should I do...and do you think he likes me??

20090220222145AAdMHxQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is wrong with me? 2 dates and I get turn down!?	What is wrong with me? 2 dates and I get turn down!?   I recently started dating. Both ended up no where and I am looking back and wondering what I did wrong. Do I need to start panicking or just need to date more?      Here's a brief summary of how things went down with the 2 girls.      1. First one was about 4 years younger than me. We had a really great time on our first date. We were able to have fun simply just talking. However, she wanted a friend in me and told me she wasn't ready for any relationship. I guess that's a nice way of saying she's not interested in me.      2. The second girl I met was my age. I really didn't have the motivation to meet her because I was so heart-broken over the last girl, which was only 2 weeks before. I wasn't too excited about her and what made it worse was that she was the type that knew that she was hot and acted somewhat cocky. She was not interesting and I really wanted the date to end as quickly as possible. My first impression of her was not good but I wanted to give it a second go around. At first she said yes, but then she never returned my call, so I never called her back.      This all happened in a 2 months span and I am left wondering if I have a problem. I guess it is hard to tell anything about me with what's on this posting. But what the heck do I do? Just keep on dating? What are some things that I should watch out for or fix?
20090221001426AAdIJgO	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Engaged for 2nd time, but still like some one else.?	Okay, so the situation is that I was married to guy#1 for 2 years and then we got divorced. Guy#1 moved another woman in and we just weren't compatible anymore; therefore I started dating. I dated 4 guys and became really infatuated with the last guy I dated and we will call him guy#2. Then along comes guy#1 again and says that he wants to try it again. Well I had moved out of town and was moving on with my life and he was having problems with his new fiance. So he came to visited me and asked me to move back in with him. (This was the third time we had seperated while we were married, but the first time divorced.) So we had a reputation of seperating and getting back together. So I told guy#2 that my ex wanted to try it again, but that I still cared for him and he said that he understood. I moved back in with guy#1 and it is better than it had been b4, but I really miss being single and doing whatever I want. And lately I have been talking to guy#2 and have realized that I really enjoyed being with him. With guy#1 I don't have the conversation that I have with guy#2, but I have the past(which wasn't always good) with guy#1 and I am used to it. But on the other hand with guy#2 I have felt completely comfortable since day 2 and have since. I am engaged to guy#1, but dont know if I am doing it 'cause it is old hat. I really miss guy#2, and everything about him. It was never about sex with guy#2, even though it was great but about the conversation that I couldn't ever have with guy#1. Also the sex was great with guy#1. A part of me wants to tell guy#1 that I don't want to rush into it again and that I still want to date and be single. How do I deal with this I am just so freaking lost and confused?
20090220224238AA6XfQ6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Forget about him and move on?	My husband has hurt me Very much the last 8 years we have been together, he leaves for 3 or 4 days at a time, with no word and comes back acting like nothing has happened. I usually track him down like the dumbo that I am, and then he comes back we fight a little bit and then everything is back to normal. Well we also have 3 kids together, they are 3 2 and 1, I have stayed with him for them, but its to much already. My friend says I should go find him because it lets him know I really love him, that's what he expects me to do and I don't have the energy to play this game anymore, what are some ways I can break this cycle and keep my family together??

20090220200839AAFFxc5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Some Weird girl lmao...?	So I was at college, and this girl that i barely knew from last semester comes up to me, she seems happy, we hug. After we talk a bit, I'm about to leave and she says "here let me give you my number so that we can hang out."      I called her back a few days later, no answer. My number is restricted and she doesn't pick up restricted numbers from what I remember her saying. So I thought ,maybe she's not answering because it's restricted. I tried calling a few times after that once more a few days later after that, and today. This is like 2 weeks lol. It doesn't make sense to me why she wouldn't answer. I tried the *82, it didn't work, but I do remember it being restricted when I called her with the *82 attached nonetheless, if I remember correct.      Any ideas about this?       I would understand if she didn't want to answer IF I had been the one to ask her, and she didn't want to talk, but in this case she gave me her number so she must want me to call back.      I think I should leave a message, what do you guys think?

20090203102320AANW0jM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I separate from my husband? ?	Feb 6th, I'll have been married for 10 yrs. We have been basically co-existing for the past 3. We have 1 son who is 9 and is the main reason I dont leave. My husband is verbally abusive to both my son & I but he doesn't think he is. I have been thinking/talking about leaving for a long time but just dont/want to be alone. I've been running into this guy who goes to the same gym as me everywhere & we have a lot of things in common and I'm realizing that life is too short for regrets and unhappiness. I dont want to pursue him and leave my husband and regret it because I thought the "grass was greener". Any advise?

20090203103120AABePjC	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do with friends?	I had a best friend for many many years, we go to school together and just hangs out alot.   7 months ago i flew away to spend some time with my love, who lives very far away.   to keep in contact i called her alot and sent letters.. after around 4-5 months apart things got wierd..   once when i called she told me she was already on the phone and asked me to call again in 45 minutes, which i did, but then she said that she had homework to do so she couldnt talk.   i called on christmas but then she was busy.   i called on new years but she was busy shopping with her mom.   i called on my birthday but she was busy talking to people on msn.      now im home again and everything has changed. she doesnt talk to me much at all, and leaves me behind when she goes to lunch or home. and she doesnt mind me walking all by myself, 3 meters behind them. she now only hangs with the guys in our class.   when i try talking to her she responds in short answers..      im a shy person and i dont know the guys in our class so well, so i dont really want to bother them      i dont know what i've done wrong or what im supposed to do about it..

20090203103244AADEbrk	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What is she trying to do?	So, I got married in November and had the best day of my dreams. My husband and I were together for 5 years, we we spent months planning the day of our dreams full of the things that meant the most to us, culture, family, music, location, etc. Like most brides and grooms do...       Now, his widowed mom is getting married in a few months. She is an older mom and this is her second marriage, but she is just hurting me day after day. She got engaged a few months ago, during our planning time, and didn't have tie for us anymore because she had to plan her day.       She is having the same readings, the same reception hall, with the same food, asked for my DJ, florist, and get this... is ALSO using my wedding song?!        Like I said before, I put everything into my wedding from my heart, and I feel sometimes as though she is taking what I made "ours" and wanting to make it hers, but not for the same reasons... and for selfish and childish reasons, like, the wood floors, it has a good beat, it means a lot to someone else... nothing personal to her and their relationship. It makes me feel as though I planned her wedding, not mine. My parents don't even want to go to the wedding, because of how LARGE and out of proportioned it has all become. They disagree with a lot of what she has done and is doing. I am honored to be reading, and had to buy the bridesmaid dress and plan the bridal shower... What do I do? Why do I feel as though everyone will go to her day and say to me... oh, wasn't this thier hall, we had this food last time, wasn't that their wedding song... oh that was just like hers... ??? What is she trying to do? I'm shaking... she makes me so upset, but as my mother-in-law, I don't want to tell her or hurt her feelings... Thanks for your suggestions.
20090203103309AAcqXyr	Family & Relationships;Family	Writing a Thank you letter to hospital (thanking them for helping my grandfather until he passed)? --Need help?	Last Monday My Papa ( grandfather) passed away of pneumonia. He was 3 months shy from his 87th birthday.      I can't express how devastated I am because both my Nana (-my grandmother who is still alive at 91) and Papa practically raised me along with my parents.      Last week I was given the honor to write his obituary for the paper and my Aunt (a teacher for 15 years) proofread it for errors to be submitted.      She then asked me to write a "Thank you" letter to the hospital (JFK) ,including the ICU dept for all of their efforts.      It took a whole day just to write the obituary. I really put thought into what I wrote but now, I am just drawing blanks. I feel that because the service is in a few days (Friday), it is getting harder to write this letter.      I am truly at a lost of words (even now) and I was hoping someone out there will be able to help me think of a few nice things to say.      You can include personal or professional experience if you wish. Any help would be appreciated. ~ I don't want to let my family down.      Thanks everybody =)

20090220203842AAc5FV5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am deeply in love with a girl but there are two problems:?	1. first she has a boyfriend already and usually, i would give up right there, but i know that she is not happy with her relationship because he is  way over protective to the point of getting into physical fights with the security at our school. Also, he insults her by calling her really rude names that i wont write here, but you know what i mean. she might only still be with him out of pity also because he has health issues. I can tell she isnt happy because they are always arguing non stop which she tells me about. this leads to my next problem.      2. we have become really close friends because she tells me about all her problems. i really doubt that she could ever like me more than a good friend. i want to tell her how i feel, but i really dont know what will happen.      I think that I should just give up, but i need someone to either confirm that or tell me otherwise, I'm just so confused. Also, if i do give up, should i still continue our friendship or become more like acquaintances? Honestly, losing our friendship seems too much for me because then i wouldnt be able to see her that much let alone talk to her. Please tell me what to do.
20090220204455AA6Liwc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Relationship dilemma?	I am going through a tough phase in my relationship with husband. 3 years back we were dating and fell in love. But while we were in love, my husband flew literally for 7 hours to meet his female friend and spent over a week with her. Later she flew back and they spent a few more days together. And he never told me anything about it. After our marriage I bumped into one of his letters to her where he tells her how sorry he is and that she will always have a very special place in his heart. He tells me she was just a friend and nothing more. But of course it has to be more .. right? He never tells me what went wrong with her .. coz he says it was just friendship. I have tried to forget the episode but haven't been able to for years now. and he wont talk about it either. I feel hurt. If he had something going on with her why did he propose me . marry me ? Please help!

I decided to crawl on my hands and knees and get between his legs and ...well do the obvious. So, I unzipped his pants but he swatted me away. At first I thought he was teasing but then he told me that he was on the phone to a friend and I should not have done it.       He said he could prove that I was wrong by asking you guys on yahoo answers.       So, should a woman never do "that" to a guy while he is on the phone?      thanks......I feel stupid right now.

I think he likes me, but i'm not 100% sure. or really now that I'm thinking about it... I'm not even 1% sure. How would i go about telling him, or hinting to him that I like him? I don't want to embarass myself too bad, if I find out he isnt interested, but I still want to know. This way if he doesn't like me I can stop flirting and stop trying.       So technically, guys, what would you hope to hear from a girl to kinda hint that she likes you? (if that makes sense)      and girls, what have you used already that has worked?   ?   thanks
20090220212510AAfb4VP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy problems...anyone's view is great.?	so, i met a boy, marching band, im a feild commander so i got to get to know him easily (from going section to section) boy and girl fall in love. a month and a half later, they date, for three months. everything's great, girl is happy, guy is happy. or so we thought. he decided to break up with her.      she is completely heart broken considering there was no warning he would do it. he blamed it mainly on family problems. a month later she finds out he left out a lot more of the truth. the truth is she was too "clingy" (they only got to hang out twice in 3 months they were together), she called like 10 times a day (the most was 3, once no pick up, 2nd to talk (20 minutes at the most), 3rd to ask a quik question), she got mad when he hung out with friends and gave him "crap" for it (i wouldnt get mad at him for being with his friends, just agravaited b/c he gets to see them every weekend, and me once like every month and a half, i cant even remember what kind of "crap" i gave him for it).   ohh yes, i cant leave out, now when i talk to him, he's nice to me to my face, then to my friends, when they mention me he gets an attitude and says i've been annoying lately.      soo. my simple-but-not-quite question is: what the hell is he thinkin?      P.S. the reason i ask is b/c i miss our relationship soooo much (when we were together i was happy. not just "oh yeah i have a bf" happy, but accually happy. now everything is just...in a blurr i guss.)      anywho, thanks for your time!

20090220212838AA3xjf7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever had to let the one you Love go?	I probably made the hardest decision of my life. Me and this girl like each other so badly, but the fact is there is a big age difference between us, six years, she's 17, im 23.  I never cross that sexual line between us, for the fact that i knew it was illegal but we both mutually agreed that we could not continue hiding what we had from our family and friends, it didn't help that her friends planted seeds in her head and made her believe that i was to old for her. BUt in the same respect i always knew that this wasn't possible, she knows i love her and will always love her and i know she loves me. But we can no longer live like this because she doesn't want to keep what we have a secret and neither do i, but the fact is we will lose Also of our loves ones if we continue doing what we were doing...hopefully down the road well be together again.......Has anyone gone through this or something similar, if so, how did you handle it?

Anyways, sometimes I get the feeling he likes me back, and sometimes not. We just happened to be texting on Valentine's Day, and he tossed that into the conversation. He sent two texts saying that he was spending the holiday along and single, and then talked aout going to a party dateless. One day, we texted and then he just stopped texting, and never replied. A couple days later he texts me back, it's going well, and then he throws in that he found a cute date for the party. What the hell does this mean? What do I say back. Is he just interested in being friends? Cause some of our texts have been a little flirty, I think.

She tells me that she cares so much, yet every now and then, she goes through a 1-2 week period (and i dont mean that kind of period lol) where she wants nothing to do with me. doesnt want to see me or even talk to me. But she always comes back as though nothing had been bothering her and she is just a lovy dovy as before. Is this something to worry about or just give her the space as i have been and let it ride?

20090220220546AAxQ6oV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in a situation like this?	Here's the scenario:      Both of my friends are in a "private" relationship. "Private" meaning that they don't want anyone else to know. They've tried many times to deny the fact that they're going out. One giant blunder they made was not to tell me to also deny the truth. Yes, I've nodded to the question, "Are they going out?" To make matters worse, I've nodded to the person with all the connections. Oh, what shall I do? I've entrusted my loyal and reliable internet friends with the task of advising me through this situation. What will happen next? What should I do to help mitigate the problem?

I asked him so many times if he was joking or lying, that if he was serious. He said he isn't lying to me. So that worries me if I am pregnant because Im still young, Im 18 and hes 20. My period ended before the sex, like four days before the sex. My best guy friend says that I might not be pregnant but not 100% sure .      so I wanted to know if I could be pregnant or not ?   I want to head what is your opinion about this ?

20090220222256AAC6X3B	Family & Relationships;Family	Help with my stupid mum?	My mum had known this guy for about 3 years over msn and stuff, and two days ago they finally met.   He came to our house and got drunk and they did it hours later.   The day after (2nd day of knowing each other in real life) he, according to my drunk mum, asked her to marry him and she said yes.       He's nearly 25. She's nearly 50.      He has two young kids.      This is totally wrong on so many levels, yet she fails to realise it. She thinks I shouldn't get involved in her personal life, and is dissing ME for thinking she's being unreasonable!!      Does anyone else agree with me that this isn't gonna be a healthy relationship??
20090220222321AA0kQbV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Dont really want to go to this party?	i made the oh-so-wondeful choice of joining a fraternity. basically a nerdy frat where only a few of the guys are major players. i'm not close with of the guys there and theyre more like friends of convenience. i made the even better choice of living there, so i dont get as much freedom      we're hosting a party tonight. 2 of the guys who live at the house, who arent frat members, will also show up. these guys were my friends, but after their offensive immature acts a couple weeks ago, i got angry at them and we havent spoken since. i dont wanna even look at their faces tonight since theyre so stuck up to even apologize for their actions.      they were my best friends there. i'm not close at all with the other members. it may get really boring at the party tonight. also, in the past, hardly any hot girls showed up, and the ones that did were mostly occupied with the players and jerks, most of whom arent even part of the frat either, since they got invited. plus, i'm not the type of guy who can/wants to get into a one night stand. i'm also hardly a drinker or partying type.      i joined the frat for the wrong reasons. i needed a place to live. these guys are nice and all, but we just dont click at all

He is from new jersey and he's really tall and really cute and i just love to hear him talk and the way he carries himself and everything he says is just so smooth and he makes me feel like i can be myself, completely. heres the thing.. he sits at lunch, in a place that people call "reject ally" and he is such a nerd. he is like 5 years behind in style and he just is not someone i would typically like.

20090220223627AABJlO9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When i think things are going well, it ends up the guys always saying they like my kids, what about me?	I always start out as friend, sometimes I have stronger feelings, but keep them inside. This is the second guy that wants to know why I keep in contact with them and hang out. I'm suttle and say because there a great person and fun to be around.Which is no lie. When I ask the same question back they always say they love my kids, nothing is really said about me. I'm confused. I don't want to get hurt if I do open up and they feel different. Sometimes it's just best to leave things the way they are and be thankfull. But I'm going on 5 yrs of knowing this person. Help with some advise.
20090220224052AA2CePH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! me! please! this is so important to me!?	okay. so i like this guy at my school. he is a skater and totally my type.i met him this year and this is what he does and i need u to tell me if he likes me or not.      -he hang out with me at lunch mostly.   -he hugs me alot=]   -he told me i was weird in a good way.   -i found him staring at me a couple of times.   -he runs with me in PE.   -he picked me up from the ground once, which was hella cute.      okay and he asked me to hangout with him after school so we could smoke (but please dont judge me) and i hella started coughing cuz it was after a while that smoke. is that a bad thing or embarrasing?

20090220223918AAlXxvp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I call the cops?	i just went outside to smoke- and our house is at the end of a cul-de-sac.  There is an suv parked and obviously two people are in it.  It sounds like they are arguing.  The car is turned off- and they flipped the lights on for .02 seconds, so i couldnt really see what is going on.  I've been sitting in our front office for awhile now- and can see when cars drive down the road- so they either drove down the road with the lights off- or they've been sitting there a really long time.  I find it odd they are sitting there with the car off- because we live in michigan and it's close to zero outside right now.     Am I just being a paranoid mother at 1:45am?  Or should I call the police and let them know something "suspiscious" is going on?

20090220225457AA3SQbJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex boyfriend is a US Marine in Iraq. We've been broken up for about a year. Should we get back together?	Im a 19yr old college student. We started dating when I was 17. Before he went to Iraq we started back talking. We've always made it known that we loved each other, but now we want to get back together when he comes home. Is this a wise decision? He's asked me to marry him before, but recently he recanted and said he is no longer ready but he still wants to be w/me. Our relationship would be long distance and we've already been through so much together. What should I do about this? He is the only guy i've ever loved.

20090220233944AAYSR82	Family & Relationships;Family	What safety issues arise when fostering a child?	My husband and I have been considering foster parenting for some time now.  We are a loving couple with two small children, ages three and five.  We both believe we were born to love and parent our children.  When I think of others out there who are not being given the love and stability that our children are, it pains me.  Fostering would be the greatest gift our family could give to another.  Here is my dilemma… I completely understand the challenges we could face when inviting a child into our family.  These children are most likely coming from broken lives.  I need to know if the safety of my two children would be at jeopardy by becoming a foster parent.  I am looking for personal experiences.  I am not concerned with the child being a harm to us, but the parents and family of that child.  I can only imagine the rage that could course through a person after having their child(ren) taken from them.  I fear uncomfortable confrontations and dangerous interactions.  More than anything, I fear a family would seek “revenge” on my own children… not understanding that we are only trying to help.  I am sure these situations are few and far between, with confidentiality and other regulations, but I am a worrier when it comes to my children’s safety.    Now please… I do not need to hear how the benefits outweigh the risks… I am fully prepaired for all the extreme hard work and sacrifices, I am not however willing to sacrifice my own family.  So maybe I am answering my own question… I would just like to hear some personal experiences and thoughts on this subject.  Thank you so very much.
20090220234945AAw2Ijv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel like im not being very bright!?!?	Okay..I like this guy and he is soooooo sweet to me.

I dont know and on top of that everyone at school says he is a player but i don't really know for sure. One more thing, i dont know but like i dont want to be emotionally attached to anyone but it seems that i am starting to be with him...Help...What should i do?!

20090221013937AAyxdTT	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I move out from home?	My name is Ruby and I'm turning 15 in 8 months.   Recently I've been really wanting to move out from my home. My parents verbally abuse me and everyone's always yelling and I don't know what to do.      I have a job already. At the moment I only work one day a week, usually for four hours and that earns me 45$ a shift.   I've already saved up about 250$ and that should keep me going for a little while, I guess.      My friend offered to let me move in with them, they said I'd be welcome for as long as I'd like.      But I don't know..and I really don't want to sound so young and dependent, but would my parents still pay for my school and half of my phone as they usually do?

20090219090601AAggU0g	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does it mean he is forgiving me?	We didn't do anything for valentines day.  I kind of hoped we would do something but he seemed angry when he came from work that friday.  I told him happy valentines day and he hesitated but mumbled something to the affect of "yeah you too."  Honestly though i was happy just to sit with him while he worked on some papers.  I just watched him work and i couldnt help but smile.  so i guess it was a wonderful vday considering...i was doing his laundry and i found tickets to a show, for this weekend.  Of course I thought that he was taking someone else out.  i've been faithful since my screwup, but i still have a guilty conscience it seems.  HE IS TAKING ME!!!  we have reservations to a nice restuarant and we are going to spend the whole weekend doing things together.  I'm nervous though.  does this mean that he may forgive me?  I don't want to ask him out right.  im still horny for him (it takes all i have not to jump while he's sleep).  So maybe we can start moving foward.  My mother tells to be weary.  He may be trying to soften the blow for some bombshell he is going to drop but i don't want to think like that.  I called him at work and we talked for a few minutes and everything.  Im afraid to get my hopes up but i can't help it.  If things are the way i hope, then im going to give him loving like never before, im going to pamper and be so sweet to him.  not because he's taking me out but becasue he may actually let me love him that way again.  I'm sorry nervous, i can't stop smiling.  do you think he's finally going to forgive me?

20090219104412AA6Zuvc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? Should I tell him?	So ever since I started the school I go to I remember this one guy that always used to stare at me in my Maths and Science lessons and last year I didn't notice anything but this year he started doing it again. At first I thought he was a freak but now I've started to like him. I've asked people if he likes me and they all think he does because apparently he treats me differently to the other girls in our year and he's always quite nice to me but I'm not sure.   I know that now I really like him but I also know another guy in my classes that likes me too and that just make everything harder. I can't be sure that he likes me and I don't know whether I should tell him I like him in case the other guy finds out and doesn't talk to me. (The other guy is a good friend of mine too) I'm really confused with my own feelings. Help.

20090219135102AAOiscY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What the?! does he like me or NOT?!?	PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS..   - we talk on facebook daily, sometimes for more than an hour at a time, he starts convos a lot, but I do when I can   -he teases me about bein a browner (though I'm not), he likes to debate on silly meaningless things   -He thinks it's funny when I do occasional stupid things   -We had to watch a movie in our math class once (yeah math) and I kinda kept trying to take a look at him, he didn't really catch me, but I saw him looking at me (or so I think he was) a few times   -He's not overly confident, but not under, he's just normal, he's comfortable with who he is   -We can talk about pretty much anything and everything, he's my friend   -On facebook, if he logs on it pretty much takes him not even a minute to say hi to me and start talking   -He laughs at things I say, but knows when not to laugh   -He asks questions and he remembers many things from one convo to another   -He listens well to what I say, probably better than my best friend (but then again, she's not a great listener, but he's still better than a lot of my friends)   -We were joking about beauty sleep, he said he was gonna log off facebook and go get his. He told me "you should go 2, you need it" then quickly he said "JK lol, you don't need beauty sleep"   -A lot of the time we talk like right before we go to bed, one of us will say that we'll talk again the next day   -over facebook once I said I was cold, he suggested i should go get a blanket, an hour later he asked "Is the blanket naked?" is was like "what?" he said he meant helping. i find that really strange, I don't get it   -occasionally we have minimal conversation for a day or 2, like it's almost like he's avoiding me, but as soon as I come to the conclusion that he's ignoring me, he starts talking to me a lot again   -I attempt to flirt, he laughs etc. neither of us are incredibly flirty, but yeah..   -He bugged me about liking some other guy, even though he KNEW i didn't, he was like just saying it to bug me   -He spent hours at school with just me hanging out when he coulda gone home. This has happened twice now         NOW.. here's the big change in it all..   i asked him a few days ago if he wanted to come for a walk with me.. we've NEVER hung out outside of school before. He said "nah, xbox :P" So apparently, he didn't want to, cause he'd rather play his xbox like he always does. Then later that night, I was playfully bugging him about him not coming with me, and he said that he'd come with me the next time i went.      What's with this?! By the way, asking a guy to go for a walk with me is like the biggest thing I've ever ever managed cause I'm really shy normally with guys. I swear, I'm not a 13 year old girl, I'm about half way through my teen years, I just have big difficulties with this stuff. PLEASE HELP!

20090219125833AAscIzj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I talk to him or wait for him to come around?	So me and my guyfriend have been attached to eachother, weve shared secerts with eachother. I was on his tops on myspace...   I asked him if he liked me cuz I thought he did, and he admitted that he did. We went out for like 4 days and he said its a little weird going out but I hope we can still be friends.   Really? Does "still being friends" mean ignoring me on myspace, taking me off his tops and not talking at school?   I was wondering if I should message him and ask him, or if I should wait for him to come around. If he ever does...   What do you think? What should I say? Is it even worth it? Have I lost my friend?   Thanks in advance...

20090219115056AA0m9fg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What should I do about him now...?	We had a big argument we made up after that & i didnt hear from him & i didn’t contact him either & 2day he called me after a few weeks & he was acting like nothing is happened he was just asking me how am doing & i told him to call me back later cos i was busy. Why is he calling me(don’t say sex cos there’s no way am having sex with him) after we argued & made up & everything was fine & ignored me 4 such a long time.. Am soo confused.   ? WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO HIM?   ? WHAT DO I DO NOW?   ? WITH HIM HE DOESNT TALK TO ME MUCH LIKE I WOULD WANT TO.    (He was like a close book)         After a few months he changed & became very distant, went calling me much & he would argue and yell at me all the time. When we made up everything was ok then he went very distant again and wasn’t calling me at all & i ring him and said ive miss him & that i wanted see him he wasn't straight forward on when i would see or he would yell at me on the phone.       He said i was cheating on him when ive been totally devoted to him he said i was taking him for granted when i wasn’t. I felt really bad that he didn’t know how much he meant to me. he wanted reassurance all the time. He totally changed & i was very confused & he made out like everything was my fault saying i was the 1 that’s changed & i was questioning myself to much i was soo stressed out i was going crazy.

He was looking at me but i thought he might just be looking for no particular reason so i turned away.   I looked back and he was looking somewhere else but later he was staring at me again. when i looked at him he didn't turn away. the same thing happened 4 times.      i thought that there was something on my face but i asked my friend and she said i looked fine.       the next day i was kind of walking besides him and then my friend came and start talking to me about this teachers bum (quite loud) and a few seconds later he walked off to talk to another girl he knew.      nothing happened after that but i cant stop thinking about him. its been really long + sometimes i see him in my dreams.    i have never felt this way before but did he like me?      im actually begging you to answer, im desperate!

20090219112853AAYBdaV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's wrong with staring at another girl's boyfriend?	I saw this couple eating lunch together, and the guy was super cate.  So I sat down kind of close to them to look at the guy, like a couple of chairs away.  I was just staring at him, and he sometimes looked at me, and we both smiled at each other a few times too.  His girlfriend noticed that he kept on turning his head to look at me, and she noticed that I was looking at him too.  So the stupid girl asked her boyfriend to go get her another drink, but that was just an excuse to make him leave, so that she could talk to me.  Than the guy left, and the stupid girl accused me of flirting with her boyfriend.  What the hell, I was just looking at him and stuff, I didn't even say a word to him.  We said crap to each other, she got pissed and raised her voice at me.  I was like ok whatever, and I just left before things got worse.  Anyways what the heck was her problem?  Was what I was doing seriously that bad?  I mean if you were the girl in my story, and you noticed me looking at your man, would you even care?  If you say yes, than why?  All I'm doing is looking at the boy, what the heck.

20090219150621AAtcYSs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I haven't dated in a while and I need to know how do you get back out there? Read Below?	Hi everyone I am currently in college full of women and I transfer here last year and I really haven't met too many women. People are so surprised when I tell them this because most people think I am a attractive young male. The ones I have met (one of them is a huge player) One of them I kept as a friend even though I still had feelings for her, but she didn't want to date me for some reason, and the other one (this one I met a week ago) is too busy to date. It seems like everyone has their clicks and really don't want to be involved with anyone else and it is hard for them to let you in. What I want to know is how do I get back out there and date after I haven't dated in some time. People say meet women doing things you like but I just work out and stay in and play video games and women hate to be hit on while working out. What should I do?

20090219143624AADkdZE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you know if its possible to die from love?	I love this individual with all my life. Even as he stabs nails in my heart by blocking me out of his life. It has been 2 weeks and a few days ever since he's left me and I cannot eat, I've lost 15lbs, dropped 3 jean sizes and going on lower. He ignores all of my e-mails and won't talk to me on the phone. I have several panic attacks throughout the day and I break down as well. I've also had disturbing thoughts about committing suicide. I'd do anything, to hear his voice once again, but the only reason he'd hear me out is if I were dying.    I really lost my reasons to continue on with life..    I've never been like this, so I don't know if its because its the first time I've actually loved anyone.    What can I do? Sometimes I feel like I can go on, but most of the time I just want to disappear off the face of the earth so I would stop my suffering. I'm really lost... please help.

20090219142617AAs6nGu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I even be her friend anymore?	Today, my best friend got me in trouble with my advisor, my English teacher and my principal because she copied my ENTIRE essay. I sent her it to use as a template, because she was having difficulties. Instead, she just took the entire thing and changed the language. Now, because of that, I'm in trouble, along with her.    Recently, she's been treating me like I'm not even a friend of hers. She bailed on me several times when we had plans for weeks. On Sunday, we had plans to see The Uninvited, and she bailed, because her family was going to the mall to do something fun. We had the plans for over a week, and then she just bailed. And it happened before, for her mom made her clean her room and do her homework before coming to see me, and apparently my friend didn't tell her mom that we had plans.   I'm getting so fed up with her. Should I just end our friendship, because I'm so sick of her sh*t?
20090219145227AAMTAQ4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Yeahh, Another Crush Question.?	Yeah, Umm, I've been crushing on this guy and his friend asked me one day after nudging me...   "Do you still like *CRUSH NAME* ?" He says.   "No. I never did." I reply. I didn't know he knew so I lied.   "Well, that's not very good." He replies.      What does that mean? PLUS, my crush's friends used to be really mean but now they're like my own friends. I find my crush staring at me in class sometimes and he doesn't care that I get something wrong in class out loud and I get embarrassed. He doesn't laugh or ANYTHING. I once accidentally looked at him by turning around and he accidentally looked too and smiled at me.      Oh yeah, today his friend kept bringing him up, the guy I like kept raising his hand for things I raised my hand for, and he has been trying to impress the people around me these days. Today he kept passing by me and after his friend made me laugh, he became upset. He kept trying to make me laugh too, which worked.   My friend emailed him saying "I saw you stare at (my name) today, do you like her?" without asking me.   He replied, "No."   I mean, I don't know.   The signs, I've taken quizzes. It says he likes me. I don't know though. What do you think?

He's really really great.   We've been dating for almost 2 years. I'm a senior and he's a sophomore in college.   I love him and we both have expressed that we would love to be with each other forever.   I still want to marry him, but sometimes I wish I could be in a less serious relationship with a guy.   Like, just date a guy just to date and have fun. No strings attached.   It would probably kill my man to tell him this, so I would never ever want to do that to him since I do love him.   I just haven't really dated anyone else before him, and I would like to date a few more guys before I like get married/engaged. You know?   I feel like I'm already engaged to him.   Most of the time I love being in this more mature, committed relationship, but sometimes I want a fling.   I don't know what to do...      Help?

Okay, heres my options,      1) Break up with him now   2) Wait til the house is renovated then breakup with him (so we can sell and go our seperate ways)   3) Some how make him break up with me (ideas?)   4) Tell him everything and let him decide (much like option 1)   5) Just leave things how they are         Short version,      Dating for 3 years in June   Been living together for 2 1/2 years   Own a house together (bought it a year ago)   I love him (you might not believe it when read further down but its true)   We've discussed and planned our future together   I've slept with another guy (he doesnt know)   I've made out with his best friend (he doesn't know)   I've been sms'ing a guy in a diff state which has turned into naked pics and heaps of sex talk etc (he doesn't know)   We're both in our early 20's   I guess I'm just not sure if hes my forever    I know he loves me, sooo much but hes kinda controlling/i've been feeling caustaphobic for a while   I know breaking up with will hurt him so much as hes said I'm his everything   I want to avoid telling him what i've done cause i don't want to hurt him that badly   I worry that if we break up he'll never be okay again      So tell me what you would do from the options and any advice or tips on how to do it would be good.

20090219131215AAe2kR9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So I Know This Sounds Like Those Stupid Soap Operas...?	I like this guy in my homeroom and he's in 2 out of my 4 classes (we're in 6th grade and one teacher teaches both reading and english and the homeroom teacher teaches spelling then we have science, social studies, and math). I KNOW that he likes me as a friend because he rides my bus also and he talks to me most of the time. Last year he dated my friend and after a while she decided she didn't want a boyfriend. This year she's become girlier and girlier to the point of her being a real brat. She wants to ask the boy out again but keeps arguing with herself, saying things like, "I want to date him, but I don't want a boyfriend." I don't know if this guy likes me or his ex and I feel that if I ask and he says no, I'll seem like a total idiot to him. What do I do???
20090219110246AAxslT9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When you want someone to stop calling....help!!?	ok, someone keeps calling me, and i don't want to talk to them, its just this guy i met, but hes starting to freak me out a bit. when he calls i don't answer the phone, but he tries to call me over and over again every day. i know i could block the number, but hes started calling me on other numbers (im pretty sure its him, obviously i don't know, coz i don't answer, but i have the numbers of everyone i know, so it cant be anyone else). do you think its kinder to just answer and give some reason as to why i don't want to talk to him and tell him not to call me again, or should i just keep ignoring him and hope he gives up soon?      i don't want to hurt his feelings any more than i have to, and im gonna hate that awkward conversation that's gonna come from telling him not to call. whats the best way to handle this?      i don't really want to talk to him even to tell him to leave me alone, coz i think hes gonna be kinda mad, and he knows were i live and stuff. i would rather ignore it, but do you think that's really the right way to handle this? im getting quite scared to answer the phone

HI im 28 and have been on little or no dates. im an indian guy living in new zealand.  Compared to the typical european bloke, they get more dates than i do, even though they are a$$holes, women would rather date them than me.  I never look down at others, i dont follow my culture, i was born in nz so i act this way.  i think i'm okay looking, ive got a good education, good career. yet why do women give me the cold shoulder when they first see me? i never do this to them, yet why do they do this to me? I dont mind any person's colour yet why do they mind mine?

So we like each other and we knows it, we sorta said it. So today is her birthday. i called her and wish her, later in the evening (I dont live in USA to be clear, so it's night time now) her friend called me and said i need to come cause they are throwing her a surprise party. Well, i told her i will try to come, but i didn't. But her friend kept calling me, she force me like hell.. she even said that 'A' - the girl, would be happy to see me there. then it struck me, why her friend was doing this? did she actually tell her friend to force me? and did she tell her friend she likes me? or any other interpretation about this situation.      PS: i do feel bad, i didn't go but i am having a very bad cold now.. :S   Though i had apologized to her via text, and she replied it's ok and said get well soon.      Thanks!
20090219123242AAQQIlB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If a girl likes you will she avoid you if she thinks she is not looking her best?	I know this girl is attracted to me and is normally very nice and smiles and says hi to me when she sees me.  She has always been the first to say hi and says bye in a very sexy way when we part.  The problem is when I happen to see her in her glasses she avoids me.  They are not the most attractive glasses but I do not care.  She is beautiful either way.  Do you think she is avoiding me because she does not think she looks her best in glasses and what can I do to convince her otherwise?
20090219123446AACvrJw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I approach the guy?	Yesterday I went to this furniture store to apply for a cashier position and I saw a really gorgeous salesman! As I was walking towards the customer service desk to pick up an application, he said hi to me and smiled and kind of laughed and I said hi back. I was totally checking him out the whole time I was there but I'm not sure if he noticed or not. I was going back today to drop off my application. Should I approach him? I was thinking about giving him my number but I'm really shy about approaching guys and it would be kind of embarrassing but he is so good looking! Very handsome. If I don't, I'm always going to wonder "What if?" but at the same time, I'm very shy and don't want to embarrass myself. Should I give him a little note with my phone number or just forget about it?

At the moment I am signed in as "away" on MSN? My ex logged on and then straight away I get this message saying "Jamie would like to share files with you. Do you want to start a sharing folder with Jamie?"      So what does this mean? Is he sending this to every one of his contacts or just me? Does he want to share a particular file or just create a sharing folder?      Also, he broke up with me and broke my heart and even though I miss him everyday I didn't think he'd want anything to do with me again so what's this all about?

20090219144720AAVQJ0D	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Its as if he dont or wont bring himself to trust me...?	Well basicly my parents are divorced , So I spend 5 days of school at my house (my main house , mums) and then in the weekends and 3/4 of the holidays I spend it at dads.      But I've been 13 & 1/2 now lol and basicly my sister at my dads has got a job and my dad works but he is his own boss , so theres days i go over to dads and its on weekdays.      But my dad just wont go to work. He will go to work when I'm not there and when I was younger my sister was at home and babysat me he went to work. But now he wont or like today he will go for 2 hours -pointless and he'd go from 8 to 10 and I'd wake up at 10!      Its as if he wont trust me home alone , I've been home alone at my mums sometimes for 5 hours and she trusts me! Or 1 hr normally after school. She trusts me , I feel.      And I am lets say 'responsible' , I know how to cook my food and tidy my bedroom (steps of independence) and I've even met my other sister on the other side where the train goes to!      I say to my dad 'trust me' 'I am 13' and he keeps on saying 'have your phone on , have your phone on!' I already know.      Plus its probably more safer at my dads than mums.      But he wont trust me! He was really suprised when I walked to town by myself (cos he lives right by it) and got some clothes. I'm like what!! I learnt this a year ago (well at my mums I get a bus :D)      I go to secondary school too and my grades are in the category of High-average.      Any ways of getting him to trust me , lol sorry for the rant!      Also , I'm just a typical teenager - no crime records!

20090219120558AAOa0RP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need as many women to answer this question as possible. It's kind of an experiment.?	How many of you would rather be with one guy or more than one? The reason I'm asking is because I want to find out if more than half of the women in this world would treat men respectfully, or treat them as sex objects. I'm also trying to find out how different women are from men.      As a woman myself, I would rather be with a nice guy who loves and respects me than to be with someone who would break my heart. I'd make it clear that I love and respect him and I expect him to do the same with me.

20090219144058AAFdDEf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For men, why this man ignores me , when I think he likes me?	my colleague who might be a bit younger than me , just completely ignores me. He is new in my company( 6 months) and I got to chat up with him during one company function.    We chatted for about 1/2 hour, no flirting at all. I didn't have  anything in mind. But, from the next day onwards, I saw him always looking at me. But, then, he withdrew and started to completely ignore me.      Then, I stopped talking to him too, and then he changed and again started to look at me and started to say hi/hello to me.      I don't know what's on his mind. I am a very attractive lady, a lot of men come after me. But, this particular guy is very attractive, well educated and decent. His personality matches mine as we are both decent and reserved and not into much flirting etc.      I never bother him, or even go upto speak to him. But, he even ignores me even when we bump into each other in the corridors etc.      Why does he do that? Does he think I am after him?
20090219105027AAiRd2j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I deserve this from my boyfriend?	i kept breaking up with my boyfriend and then getting back together with him because i didn't know if i wanted to be with him. so to make a point he hooked up with this girl he used to date who he knew i really didn't like. isn't that mean? we're still together but this girl keeps copying my style and has tried to hang out with him again. they dated for a few months in high school before him and i met. that was years ago.      i feel really insecure about myself because i was really mean to him and even tried pursuing other guys. he says he technically didn't cheat since we were broken up, and i never cheated on him.      how would you feel?

20090219105637AAUSOoT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did he want me to take off my bra?	I'm 18 and I'm a virgin and my boyfriend is 25 and definitely not a virgin but he hasn't had sex in almost 2 years. The other night he called me and I was about to take shower and he asked me what I was wearing and I told him I was wearing a bra and panties and he tried to get me to take off my bra and touch myself while I talked to him. I told him no because I thought it was weird though. Then the next day we were talking and he told me he was getting really frustrated because he thinks that I don't like him as much as I say I do because I won't open up to him emotionally or physically. And he told me he wants to finger me today. Do you think he's just using me for sex? Or maybe he has a right to be so frustrated? Guys what do you think??

20090219144527AAVG84W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it wrong to marry for insurance?	I just asked a question about this and people FLIPPED! Oh, your supposed to marry for love and all this BS. Whats the divorce rate? 75%? I mean, sheesh....we do love each other, we live together, we do it all together.....we just never planned on getting married, and no we arent having kids either. Thats just who we are.       Why is it so wrong to take advantage of a system that takes away from single people anyway? Marriage is a diluted institution of religion, at best, yet it seemed like I was the most heartless piece of trash ever for even considering something like marrying to get on his insurance.       Why is it so wrong? How would my marriage be any different than yours? Did you not marry to get in his money? To have his kids and all that? Its all a bunch of BS.

I got his email in 5th and started to email him a ton! Well in 6th grade he confessed to me that he liked me! I was so excited and told him I liked him too! i was sooo happy. We hung out a ton after that. 7th grade was the best ever! I loved the year. In  the summer I went and visited him a ton! We hung out and texted loads. Well the end of the summer he threw a movie party and put his arm around me! I was sooo happy. Then 8th grade started. That's when it went down hill. :'( he liked another girl and things just started to change slowly. I got really depressed and was just a really sad. Things have gone and well they still haven't been good. Last friday we had a dance at our school and i begged him all that week to go. He finally said he would go and then didn't show up. I was really sad and almost cried at the dance. Saturday was the worst day ever. I was babysitting for the billionth time and my siblings made me so mad. I ran to my room crying. I got so mad that I texted him I hate you. He asked what he did and I told him that he changed. We talked for a long time. Then he said the worst thing ever. He told me to move on! I was soo sad I balled my eyes out. I haven't texted him since then. I walk throught the halls avoiding him. He really hurt me. I'm still in love with him and don't know what to do! HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!

20090219130056AAHnCxr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How many women are turned on by being dominated?	I am 6'3", around 250 lbs, and forced to shave my head since I lost my hair at an early age.  I'm not happy about it, but there it is.      Whenever I dated, I noticed the same thing with every girl, regardless if she was 4'11" or 6'5" (I've dated both ends of the spectrum).  Every single one of them wanted to be dominated.  I don't know if it was just because of my physical stature or just the women I dated.  I found that the recipe, if you will, for turning a girl on was:      1) Get on top of her and hold her down by her wrists.  Apply enough pressure to hurt slightly.        2) Thrust vigorously and violently.      3) (optional) Grit your teeth and say such phrases as: "Come on, you know you want this", "You know how bad you want it, don't you?", and "Come on, beg for it"      I was sort of disappointed with this, as I don't find it one bit arousing, yet the women felt the complete opposite.      So, would you be turned on by what I described above?
20090219122849AAlVPPW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Is this a good way to ask you out?	Several times I have tried to put myself in women’s ‘shoes’… trying to understand them emotionally….what they want… what they’re thinking… and how they like to be treated. But no matter how many times I have done that, the end result is like this, be kind, be generous, be outgoing, dress well, have good manners, have a steady job, be independent, be masculine and look handsome.       Does any woman out there know how BORING it is trying to be this way? I get so bored in my life that I just want to meet a woman at some bookstore and say, “"I'm thinking about writing a book called "Making Love," but I need a co-author...would you be interested? I've got all the chapters outlined..."      Now ladies: state your age and tell me if you would be offended by this….. or better yet… tell me you want my number!

20090219130752AAg58FD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to stay in love when boyfriend goes to college...?	I'm a sophomore, he's a senior. We're definitely in love and in the fall, he's going off to college. He wants to go out-of-state but the tuition may prevent that from happening. We both want to stay together, but I'm afraid that me, being a junior next year and he's going off to college will be hard on us. I'm not asking for advise on breaking up or me moving or anything, because that's not happening. I'm asking for any body's experience with this happening and it worked out (for some encouragement) or maybe somebody has a nice method that it'll work out when he's in college.   He may not go very far, but either way, I won't be able to see him often.      Any stories or anything?

I was looking at some of the pictures on display in the classroom and this girl which is my friend came up to me and said hi and stuff. So we were alone in the room and she starts leaning on the table and tilting her behind up. I got kind of distracted and tripped over her leg, and she started smiling. This other time she was telling me how tight her jeans were and so she started to stretch in front of me basically. She also put her legs on the table when we  talked, but I think she only did that because she got new boots. I'm not complaining, but I just want your take on this.

We recently had a really deep conversation where he told me a lot about his past (he has had a lot of problems) and said he wanted to be more than friends, he then went on to tell me he already had a girlfriend!!!!! He said he is unhappy with her, and has wanted to leave her for a long time but that she is recovering from drug and alcohol problems and felt like he couldn't leave, but said if I wanted him he would break up with her to be with me.      Now I don't know what to do. I don't want to be responsible for breaking people up but we have become so close, and I do have feeling for him. I also don't know if I can trust him: he never mentioned he had gf until now and sure hasn't acted like it (though he has never actually cheated on her with me), would he do the same to me with other girls.      Im really confused, advice or opinions would be most welcome.      Thanks

20090219120921AABe6XD	Family & Relationships;Friends	I forget how I used to feel about her...?	I have a best friend who is a girl and we have been friends for 6 years. But 3 months ago, I was arrested for drug related problems and was expelled from school. I am currently staying clean and straightening out my life. We only hung out few times but still talked after all that has happened. I went through a period of time where I missed her terribly. But after I got over that, it seems like everything has changed. We talked yesterday in about two weeks and I didn't feel the same. It's as if I already forget how I used to feel about her and I feel like I don't love her anymore.
20090219121948AAD78KX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is wrong with my boyfriend?	He asked me to have sex with him, but I want it to be special, as in when I get married. He keeps asking me but I don't want to but he is just pressuring me still. I love him and I want him and I to be together but not have sex yet. Is there someway I can tell him that so he could stop bugging me?
20090219124748AAPIJEO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Father's wife is Passive Agressive?	My father got married 1 year ago to this woman I have not yet met.  I have spoken to her a few times on the phone.  Mostly due to his health situation.  Her comments to me are very passive aggressive.  Any advice on how to handle her when I have to.  Not looking to have a confrontation and fight with my father over her.  However I am not going to be a door mat either.

20090219122810AA5VwOX	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a problem.....help. Involves one of my friends husband.?	Well my boyfriend and I have been together 6 months Valentines Day. I'm really happy in my relationship and I love him more than anything. We are totally soul mates. I know full well that he is the one. I am the one for him too.      I've recently became friends with one of my friends husband. Well when I say my friend I mean my boyfriends mums friend.       Ugh we'll got by names its easier.    Vicki is my friend (boyfriends mothers friend) and Lee is her husband. Tracy is my boyfriends mother.      So I have been talking to Lee over the last few days because I'm having trouble with my laptop and he's good with them. Now I like Lee, he's great and everything. But yesterday I felt something else towards him. Like I was getting a little crush on him. I did get a smile on my face when he logged in on MSN. I was kind of upset when me and Lee started talking and he asked what was wrong and I told him I didn't really know why. He said something really funny and made me laugh. I suddenly thought to myself that's it, I have a crush on Lee. Today I was too shy to talk to him. I needed to ask him a question but I was too shy.      My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. He lives in England and I live in Ireland so there's no need to say don't try anything on with Lee because I can't as we live in different counties. Not that I would anyway. Lee & Vicki live in the same place as Seb. Just across the road to be exact.       I'm 17 years old and Lee and Vicki are something like 35 years old.       What can I do about this? I just want this "crush" to go away. I want to enjoy my life with my boyfriend.      Thanks for your help. No rude/mean comments.

20090219132500AA8oOP6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Single Ladies.. how would you feel?	Let's say you're at work, and you're talking with a female friend (as all single women always are at all times of the day), and a guy you've never seen approaches you, interrupts your conversation with your friend, and says "Hi, you're really pretty, would you like to go out some time."   How would you react?      And if you think this is rude, uncalled-for, or just plain desperate, can you explain why people are always telling me that this is how I should approach girls?

Every time i look at them i just become instantly happy. :)      Even if my dog just go run over by a big truck.

20090219133917AAhrG1q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Where would I find a gf for my gf?	Well you see she is bored all the time and she is 22. She likes girls and would like to be with one as well as me. Or at least as a bonus. She doesn't really care. I just want her to be happy and entertained. Anyone know of this happening before? Any girls out there that would be cool with having a bf and gf at the same time?      If you say it is gross and weird then guess what...I will laugh at you and not care that you posted it lol.       So back to serious answers.       PS...if anyone likes this idea and is 18-30 and in IL let me know. I figured I might as well ask the question and take takers if the opportunity presents itself.       Thank you for your time.

20090219123510AASQYJk	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do i talk to my friends in crowded places? I get scared?	I dont mind talking to mates, but i can't project my voice at all in front of people- e.g. strangers on trains, lifts etc. I feel these strangers are listening to me, analysing me, and that they may steal my conversation partner (as my social skills are rusty, it can happen) The problem is, I just find it immensely difficult to talk to friends when people I don't know are in the area, what can i do to prevent this irrational fear?
20090219112733AAuH2Bs	Family & Relationships;Friends	I think i made a mistake?	well last year i went to a new school, i was a sophmore and I made some friends during that year.   I had a drivers license and I would give my friends rides home, and we would talk to each other at school and we would be cool.      Then senior year came and I started to become suspicious that they were just using me to give them free rides home, so i started to become distant and stop talking to them.      Well I think that was probably the most stupid thing I have ever done, now everytime i see them in my class, they avoid me and wont even say hi to me anymore (I have them in all my classes)       And because of this, I dont even want to talk to anyone else in class   And now i dont even have any friends anymore.      Should i apologyze to them, and beg them to be my friends again?   Or should i continue to be the way I am :( (im really depressed)
20090219140856AAzO54R	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend can't kiss!!! I had to ask him too kiss me aswell!!!?	It was last day of term and the last time I would see him for a week and all he did was hug me for 1 second. Then I had to say, can I have a kiss and he was like a fish!!! His lips squished up like he had been sucking on a lemon and they were all wrinkly and before he kissed me he wiped his lips!! It was only a 1 seconder and when I went 2 hug him again he didn't notice and walked off!!! I don't wanna dump him but I want to be able to kiss him and he can't do it!!! What do I do????
20090219113433AAHz8ty	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I believe my boyfriend/husband cheated. Should I leave even though I just gave birth last week?	I have been with my boyfriend/husband for 7 years. Technically 6 years. (We were seperated for 1yr...If that even matters). He was the one I gave up my virginity to. He is 25 and I am 21. Anyways he is an illegal. In July of "08" he was deported back to his country in which I shortly after went to live with him. I was there for a few months and got homesick and I was also pregnant. About 6 months pregnant, so I came back to the US. He stayed in his hometown. He illegaly came back to the U.S. after 2 months after I came back. I had found out that he was sending comments on this website that said "I like you" and she also sent him a comment saying the same thing. I confronted him with it and he swore that he was just being immature and dumb which is why he did it. I forgave him. By the way we have 3 kids together. a 4yo a 3yo and a newborn that is 1 week old. Yesterday I decided to get on the website and ask the other girl about it. By the way this is a little girl, she is only about 15 or 16 yes I know it's disgusting. I came to her wrong and she got angry and she started telling me that he tasted really good and that he gets horny to quick...and at that time my boyfriend came in the room and to verify that it was really him also she asked him what was the name of the song that he dedicated to her when he took her to her house. My boyfriend told her to stop lying and telling me things because I was getting really angry and that I had just had a baby. He got angry at me because he says I keep on looking and looking for reasons for us to fight and he swears and puts it on our newborn baby that he didn't have anything to do with her. I was yelling at him and telling him that I wanted to know the truth so that was why I was messaging her. When I asked him that why would she lie about something like that he said that women from over there are like that. I had already forgiven him for putting those comments on her page but ever since then I don't believe him when he says he didn't have anything to do with anyone. I know he's not cheating now. I'm still stuck in the past and I want to know the truth! I've been really sad and may even starting to get depressed. My baby is just 1 week old and I can't leave her so that I can work and get my own place. Do you think the girl was lying just to make me angry? What should I do?
20090219115431AAmSxcJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Resuming a friendship with an ex: is it a good thing?	many people say that after a break-up it's best to cut all contact with ex, at least for a while, to have some time to get over the break-up.       But have you ever resumed a friendship after breaking off ALL contact with ex? and if yes when did this happen? (a few weeks or longer time after the breakup?) I'm assuming that both partners would be willing to be friends.

I don't mind hugging him and having the occasional kiss but he seems to want more...like full on snogging... I still want to be with my boyfriend but i feel under pressure when i am with him. But when i am away from him I want to snog his face off!!!! i don't understand why i feel so differently at certain times.
20090219142917AACiInU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are my standards too high?	There's a girl who I notice in uni a lot and she is stunning, I also think she is a cheerleader. However I'm fairly quiet and I always see her at the centre of attention with men from the uni rugby team.   The thing is however I've never really been with a girl for a long time, I'm not very experienced and the last time I went out with someone who was on the same level of atractiveness as her she broke up ith me after 5 weeks (we didn't have much in common). However today I feel like I might be setting my standards really too high and missing women who I might have a more enjoyable time with.   What d you think   Should I ask her out
20090219110522AAOoZgr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help, what should i do?	i like one kid, and i like this other, too. the first one knows i like him a lot. the second one doesnt  but i think he's gonna ask me out soon. i'd like to go out with him but the first kid will think that i'm just going out with the second kid to get closer to the first kid.      the first kid shows some interest in me. my friends think he likes me, but i'm not so sure. i guess there's a chance.      plus, theyre like, best friends. so to hang out with the second kid, i'll also be hanging out with the first kid a lot. i'm guessing itll be awkward, considering it's already awkward just when our eyes meet.       should i go out with the second kid? or just forget about him and keep liking the first kid, who i've liked a lot for a long time.

20090219131720AA9bySd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl trouble, help me out?	Ok, so its the new semester and i got all new classes and new people in them. Well its been like, 3 weeks or so give or take, and I've started to take interest in this one girl in one of my classes. So I've been talking to her at class, and also on Facebook. During class she walks over to where i am to talk to me, so im thinking she's interested in me. So about 2-3 days ago, I basically asked her out, "Hey if your not busy this weekend I'd like to take you out" or something along those lines. She said yes, but that this weekend was bad cause she was doing alot of stuff which is understandable, and that next weekend would be much better.    So idk what to do. Its not really a question, i just want some assurance that everything is fine. I dont want to seem annoying by talking to her all the time but i also really want to talk to her.    So what do you all think?
20090219123504AAgK5SB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? i know it's long but so much details! 10 POINTS!?	so i met this boy this term. he looks at me alot in class.  he is shorter then me, so i dont know if this has and effect on him.he told my friend that he thought i was cool. and i added him on msn, and he talked to me first, and we talked for over an hour! and he told me about a girl who he met over the summer, it sounded like he was trying to make me jelous, but idunno, he told me he woudent cheat on anyone if she came down. so we had a personal convo at one point. the thing is today he looked at me in my dbl class, and i saw him whispering to his friend, and they were both looking at me when he was doing it. but last class today, we actually got grouped together, and he talked to me, and we laughed, and joked, but he kept turning round and talking to his friends. like at one point it seemed like he wasent interested. like he is an outgoing guy, like does he like me? or no? btw he acts different round other girls. like he is talky to them, could this mean something?

20090219121234AAlEyun	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any signs he might like me ?	I like this lad who is very handsome, and I started chatting to him ages ago and now times gone on I can make more conversation. When I saw him recently, I was a few meters away and he still made the effort to say allo, when ever he sees me he always says hi and make conversations.    I actually try and make it so I go past where he works as an excuse to see him.    I wanna ask for his number but I think I'm afraid of rejection, but I'm not sure, a few times he asked how old I am. I almost did once, when I was standing talking to him,he was like 'what are you 15? an I sed yea cos I am in about ten days, then he was like well I better get back to work I'll see you later, an then I wasn't sure.    Every time I walk past with my mate, I just hate it so much that I dont like no if he likes me, or anything about him. I'm at the stage where I feel kinda upset now, I don't no what to do, people probably think I'm a mug .    Many Thanks

20090219144443AA410dp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Honestly can someone help me out here :(? I really dont know what to do.. (sorry kinda long if ur bored)*?	Well first off Im 16 and I have probably the lowest self esteem on earth and each day im hurting because of it.. & Im just really tired of so much of this.. Im not doing that well in school & idk right now..      But as much as so many people say im beautiful I just dont really see it myself when I look at the mirror, so I guess its easier for people to walk over me that way ... I mean, I dont even go outside .. I just stay inside.. I canceled my myspace.. facebook & i dont really talk.. i just stay sad most of the time & introverted.      Well heres the main problem..      So I just feel hurt by my current boyfriend.. I mean lookswise his alright, but idk I feel like he's treating me less of a princess and that so many other guys who always talk to me or try to be my boyfriend I push away.. not exactly because I always talk to some.. so yea my boyfriend lied to me about not being a virgin and this girl who was jealous of me said ' nobody likes me and i was weird '.. (shes really ugly too)... and he leaves out the part of who the girl is.. and i thought that was very unnecesary.. so not only that.. he doesn't really talk to me or call.. and he wants me to come over his house over random times... I mean we talk but not that serious.. it always feels unnatural to me like this forced shyness that I cant talk the way I usually do..       & well we've gone on dates like the movies and things like that.. but he doesn't really call.. and he told me that I feel in love with your face.. & I guess I don't have a personality..   + today he was supposed to come and see me.. but instead he goes downtown with his friends.. I mean I have this week off and we didn't really do anything. & he RARELY calls.      And..      Theres about two other guys I know who've liked me for so long and i know wouldn't think twice about treating me like a princess nonstop compliments or caring if i was hurting or not..   I just feel overwhelmed and unsure of myself.. if its just me or i should end this relationship.. I dont think hes cheating.. or I hope not.. but idk any advice on whether this relationship should end or not?      Thank you guyss..      =l ? /

20090219133906AARVGxN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was I wrong or what for saying rude things to him? but my BF broke up with me over this whole ordeal.?	The week before valentines weekend I havent not heard from my BF. So during the weekend I still havent heard much from him, but in know he was home once he came from work. So on valentines day we didnt do anything i also told him i had tire problems so he said he was going to check it out for me the next day, so the next day on Sunday morning i texted him and he texted back everything was cool and he said he still was going to get my tire fixed. He even asked me if i wanted to go to the movies the next day. So later on that day I met up with him to get my one tire fixed and it cost 100.00 dollars. He said it was pricey but he claim he didnt mind. So after we left he was quiet the whole time and didnt talk much even when we got back to his place. I ended up going home. So the next day i felt bad because he couldnt treat me to the movies like we discussed so i texted him willing to treat us with the little money i got from a girlfriend. he texted me back asking me for $10 not even mentioning the movies. and he texted back saying nevermind he about to make a couple of dollars from a friend to move some stuff, still not mentioning the movies that i offered to pay. So i took it wrong and thought he was rude and i caught an attitude and said some upsetting things to him and he called back and broke up with me because of what i said and he said he's tired of always arguing and aside of that me acussing him of cheating. this is the third break-up. Why... because he's always working  and it fustrates me to the point that i get attitudes. was i wrong or was he wrong?

I tried to change his mind because I loved him more then anything.  6 months goes by and I am finally feeling strong again and feel like I will be just fine, he decides that he wants to try again.  Needless to say the trust is almost nonexistent.  Anyway...I decide this is my marriage and I have an "obligation" to try and make it work.    Problem is...I just don't feel for him the way I used to.  The passion is gone and it doesn't help that he hasn't worked full time in months and months and it's hard to have a sense of security with someone that can't contribute to the household.  I am really starting to feel like our relationship has run it's course.  So last night I try to tell him this and he starts crying and saying how unfair life is and on and on...   He is a recovering alcoholic and I am so afraid this will put him over the edge.  But I don't want this to be the reason I stay.   I am so confused but I have been feeling like this for quite some time now.  How do I tell him we just need to let each other go.

20090219113126AAml8oZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My Fiance freaking out on me - wtf!?	OK, this morning while getting in the last hour of sleep in before work. I decided to snuggle in w my Fiance and she pulled me in close and we fell asleep again (as usual).      Three minutes into it, I tossed the big cover off of us and I guess to her I disturbed her sleep 'cos she growled and had her fist in place ..not THAT close to my face but it was alarming enough. I tried to distance myself but she wouldn't let me leave, so I made an excuse and said I had to use the bathroom (I cried a bit) and then I came back and she moved the cover out of the way for me and I turned the other way (upset). She then says " You fakin baby" "Why do you have to disturb me when I'm sleeping" and then she ends it with "you FAK" ... fireball I swear .. she called me from work and I told her what she did cos it seemed like she just shrugged it off and she was like "OMG, I didn't realize I did that - I was totally asleep" .. and then it slowly sank in little by little and then she apologized again (wanting to not talk about it/face the truth) and said she won't do that again.       But the thing is, she's spaz'd on me in the morning before (w/o fists).. she's not a morning person - I get it - but I am convinced that I don't want to marry her... we're engaged but I don't think I can do this. I don't plan on leaving her but I don't want to marry her!      Any suggestions!? Thanks!
20090219113903AAkfOlS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Sex problem with my wife?	I've noticed that a lot of the porn my wifes been looking at has been of black men. I read somewhere where she wrote that nothing was sexier then seeing black man spunk all over a white woman's face. She even has an old adult friend finder profile where she says she has "Vanilla pudding waiting for a chocolate wafer to dip in it". She just seems weird that she seems to be really into it and it makes me really self-conscience bc I'm white. She almost seems obsessed with it. How should I approach this subject without her being automatically defensive. I want to at least talk about so I know at least she won't cheat on me.
20090219113425AAqpDfb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Anyone experienced in dealing with verbally & physically abusive alcoholics...?	my fiance, whom i've been with for 6 years now, is verbally & physically abusive to me. half the time she is apologetic and sad and tells me she'll stop drinking and the other half of the time she tells me it's my fault she hits me and calls me names. she says she does it becausee all i do is cry & complain..       her idea of me complaining is me asking, "why do you hit me? why do you calls me names if you love me?"      i know most people would wonder why i haven't already broken things off with her, but the woman that i met and fell in love with is still inside there somewhere and i want to get her back somehow. i'm just hurting so badly and tired of all the sadness.      what can i do?

20090219113042AAfLEj6	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do about this guy?	Me and my brother have this so-called friend that we go to church with.And a couple of months ago,I had a myspace.So I asked this friend to add me,and he did.Then a couple of weeks later,he suddenly disappears from my friend list.So I went and asked him what happened,and he says that this other girl we're both kinda friends with did it.He said he gave her his password so she could "change" some things on his page for him,and that she was the one who deleted me from his friends.The person who did it also rejected my brother's friend request,even though this guy and my brother were good friends.I believed him when he said this other girl did it,because for some reason she doesn't like me anymore,though we used to be friends.She rejected my friend request when I sent her one,too.So I didn't think anything else about it,because I couldn't do anything.So I let it go.      Then,last night,this guy tells my brother and another one of their friends that he's the one who did it all along.He deleted me,and he rejected my brother's friend request.I wasn't there when he admitted it,because if I had been,I definitely would've given him a piece of my mind.He LIED to us by telling us that it wasn't him who did all that.And he made the girl that he blamed it on look bad,too.He even lied to my mother about it once she found out.That really got her mad,too.I've been ignoring him ever since,though he's tried to get my attention.And he and this other guy both ignore my brother when they're all 3 together,and that's not right,either.Plus,the other guy our "friend" hangs out with actually blocked my brother on Myspace,though they're supposed to be friends.When my brother asked him why he did it,he just said "cause".My mom wants to talk to our "friend" about the fact that he lied to all three of us,but I don't want her to fight my battles for me.Now my brother doesn't want anything to do with either one of them,and neither do I.So what can we do,besides ignore them?      Sorry this so long,it's just a complicated situation,and I really need advice.

I laughed but i hated it, you know like you do.      He wouldnt stop, and i was like stop or else. He was like or else what.   I said stop or it will be over. Maybe i was seroius, but only because i thought he would stop. He said uh huh, and then tickled me even more. I shouted its over, and he tried to kiss me, i was so hurt that he would risk our relationship i pulled away. He let me up, and then asked me if it was really over...      I didnt answer right away because i was trying to breath. He then started to cry and apologized a gazzilion times.      He begged me to not end it, and i told him i wasnt going to.       Was i too harsh?   Is that something i shouldnt even joke about??      I feel like a horrible person.      Then in the car i said, im really sorry, i was just desprate and he spit at me "Well i guess youll do anything when you desprate."      This hurt me so much. I got out of the car at my house and walked inside without giving him a usual goodbye kiss.      so, simply, should i hate myself?

Due to circumstances neither one of us are willing to compromise, we can't be together.... ever....   We are both willing to let each other go, and have honestly tried, but we keep falling back into each others arms...       He is my weakness and my stronghold, My temptation, and Desire.... But we can't belong to one another..      How do I make the hurt and pain go away.. I know time heals all wounds, but i want to stop hurtting NOW!!

I just want the pain to go away... I dont want to long for his touch, his caress, or kiss.... I love him so much its tearing me apart...      Please dont ask why we cant be together if we have such strong feelings for each other... I'm not asking how to make that happen, or what else can i do.... I just want to know how to heal my heart.

He doesn't act liek he likes me in front of everybody but I always catch him staring at me. The only problem is this guy is somewhat if a player and I do not want to get played.   I hardly ever call him or text him first as it is but is there anything else I shoul ddo to keep him interested besides having sex with him?

20090219123450AAtr0hs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I the bad guy here?	I've been seeing a girl for about 3 weeks now. The first night we went out, we talked a little about our jobs, and learned some things about each other. I've asked her a few times since then about her job, just trying to understand more about it because it's fascinating to me and I don't know anything about it.        A few nights ago, she told me the name of her company and that it had a website, but I couldn't recall the specific website today and asked her for it again. She told me, but then she revealed that she felt I didn't trust her because I "kept asking" about her work, and that she had told me a "million times" what she does and I keep asking her questions about it. She said it bothered her and she was "just letting me know" and that she felt like I was questioning her. I told her that I wasn't questioning her integrity but only trying to learn more about her and what she does. She told me that she had already explained what she does and that she felt like she couldn't make it more clear.      I feel as if I am being penalized for asking a few questions. Am I being the bad guy here for showing interest in her and her work?

So once the git has slept with her and left, she goes for another git and the same thing happens and then keeps on going until she meets a geek who doesn't know what sleeping around means so PERFECT!       By this time she's aged 40 and has nothing to offer so yay for the geek. This annoyed me when my neighbour went through this, such a nice chap too.

Would you go out to dinner with me this weekend." Of course this is all hypothetical, so if anyone else has anything better I am very open to advice.

Lately i've been really curious about this, I've been with her for around 2 years now, and she always makes me orgasm, (if not straight away, then after a while) we haven't had sex yet, but we do everything but.. my girlfriend claims she has orgasms, but she tells me not to look at her, cause she's embarrassed, she doesn't really move much, and doesn't seem much different at any point while im doing something to her.. I've tried everything from rubbing her clit, to licking it, i've fingered her for none stop for around 40 minutes .. I dont understand what i'm doing wrong, i've even tried teasing her a little, could it be that she actually is having orgasms ?      I've also heard that some girls have different reactions to others, please get back to me on this. :]

Me and my girlfriend were together for 1 yr and 7 months and she was world, and we went we went to separate schools. I broke up with her because of another girl whom i liked very much but I didnt love her... i called my ex to tell her its over and a couple of days later me and the other girl started dating... well that lasted about a month before i realized that i made a HUGE mistake, me and my ex talked and she said she was very hurt from what i put her through and that i have to prove that i love her, i broke up with the other girl and apparently that wasnt enough. she said to give her time.. well a week later SHE starts dating my best friend, she says i dated another person so she gets to as well, it's only fair... she says she still loves me and wants to be with me but she cant seem to let her new boyfriend go. should i move on and try to get the other girl back or should i try to get my ex back, she is my first love and i dont know if i could love anyone as much as her...

20090219125007AAHGu4W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you want what you can't have?	i've been investigating some theories of why men act the way that they do.      in some instances:   women who are "in Love" are left by the men because a man is secure that she will be there when he comes back. However once she is depressed about the break up he's in no hurry of coming back...   however once he sees she's back on her feet he wants her back. why?      For instances: some men leave women when they're overweight and once they lose the weight they want them back.       Other times men say that they dont know what they feel about the women and then once the woman has moved on with her life with another man, he wants her back.      Why do men do this? is it true that men want what they can't have? or do they want to prove that they can do what ever the hell they want and then get the woman back, even when they have broken her heart..

20090219131332AATO73k	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I at least tell my guy friend that my sister is a twin?	My guy friend whose name is Landon has been talking to me about some gurl he's been seeing around the halls at his University and also at the some store that he likes going to, he tells me that she's cute but he's afraid to even talk to her. He caught a picture of her while tryin to take a pic of some water fountain outside of the patio at his school. When I saw it, I told him that that's one of my older sisters but yet he doesnt know shes a twin. Well Kandice is the one who is going to the same University that he goes to and Tiffany works at the store he likes going to... the only way you can tell which is which is by the way one has a lil mole near the ear which is very tiny.   Both look very similar and is hard to see who is who unless by the way they dress at times. Both are 22 years old and Landon is 23. So mainly he's kind of stalking both of my sisters who are twins. should I till him that there twins? and see who he rather date? I dont mind him datin one of my sisters since hes a great guy and in the past only had two girl friends which they dumped him for stupid reasons. but i just dont want him to stalk both of my sisters in a creepy way....and i know he'll like my sister that works in the sports center store since she loves sports and he loves playin sports and can have major common things together unlike my other twin sister who goes to his university....what should i do?
20090219140721AAzepXD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would anyone ever date me?	I know there are many questions on this site about this, but I really was wondering if any one would date me?      I am not pretty at all, to be honest i'm rather ugly. And i am fat, no im not just saying that. It really is true, i have been told it by many people and more then once by my own mother.      I lie about not being a big fan of physical contact, I don't let many people hug me, just about 4 of my family members and 2 maybe 3 friends and that's just because they will never let me go away with out a hug. The truth is i love hugs and physical contact. But i'm scared that when people Touch me and we get to close that they will hurt me.      Am i completely hopeless?

20090219145218AArpUfw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl trouble! Please Help!?	So here's how it goes down. I am a freshman in college and this girl is a senior in high school. About a year ago we were in the same tennis lessons together and she really liked me, but I didn't like her like that at the time. NOW I am realizing that I was a total idiot and I should have dated her. So about a week ago I have been texting her and I said that we should hang out sometime this week. She responded by saying "Yea def that would be a lot of fun!" So every time I ask her to do something, there is always an excuse to why she can't come. I'm thinking of just giving up on her because she just isn't that into me but then again maybe she is really just busy. So what should I do. Give up or keep asking her?

What is it with the gym its not that great is it?
20090219140413AAUzNND	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does love change?  This will be quite a story, I'm sure like everyone else's...?	So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost two years now, but mostly because I think I've looked the other way for most of the relationship, and I guess I'm just writing because I'd like a relatively unbiased opinion, because he thinks I'm wrong, and I don't know what i think anymore!      Anyway, we'd been living abroad for the first few months, he asked me to marry him (no ring/announcement though!) and decided to move back to the US together and live together. After we moved in together we started fighting about things, little things though, but I think he took these arguments more seriously than I did--I just think it's sort of normal to go through a period of transition and when you start living together especially. He started pulling away, he took back the engagement, and this made me insecure obviously! And so it was sort of downward spiral from there. And so (unfortunately) I read his email. And his chats. I know it's a horrible thing to do...      So, last year I read this chat between him and his (girl) friend, where he said that he doesn't feel the most love for me, that our relationship isn't the most fun or the most caring, but that he does love me. I told him that I saw this, and he explained that we'd been having problems, that we don't have a perfect relationship, that he does love me, but that it shouldn't come as a surprise. It really hurt. I don't think I fully understood what his words meant at the time, but I can't seem to let those words go. (There were others of course, but along the same lines..) In this period (and actually now too), there were/are a number of times when he's said he's going to do something, and another girl has been involved, which he didn't tell me. It's not like I would be that jealous though, I understand that guys have girl friends, I have guy friends! But it's the lying I don't understand..      Anyway, we agreed to go to couple's therapy, and we did that for a few months, and it helped us to better understand each other overall. But I keep coming back to his phrase that I'm not the greatest love of his life. I mean, for me, that's a really telling sign, that if someone thinks that in the first year, why continue? Needless to say, I broke up with him, but he begged me to come back and I did--and I wonder if I should leave again *constantly*. For him, he says (and he's great at argument--he studied law) that love grows and that just because he said that when we were going through a difficult time, that it doesn't mean that he feels that way all the time. But I think love (with the person you want to marry) is something you feel really strongly, that you could *never* say something like they're not the greatest love. I mean, why continue to date someone if they're not the most love you've ever felt? Needless to say, I obviously feel that way about him...or else I wouldn't have put myself through so much torture, right? But should I continue being with someone who doesn't feel the same about me? Or does it change, like he suggests? Is it possible that he will love me more over time? That seems silly to me...

20090219122757AAXjk7p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was he flirting with me and what was he up to?	I met this guy in a youth hostel where we both stayed for a week. We shared the same room with one of my friends and one of his and two other people. We would just casually chat this and that when we saw each other. But then one evening he started asking weird questions like do i think a girl would like it if he gave a flower to her in a nightclub (a random girl who he didn't know).   Then later they were going some where so i asked where, he said swimming, wanna come watch :P All kinds of stuff like that.   One evening we went out together with all the guys in our room. So at some point i ended up dancing with him, then he looked at me and said something like, do you like doing this? and then he kissed me. He was kissing me a lot that night on the cheeks on the lips.   We went "home" together but he didn't try anything, you know what i mean :D   He wanted me to sleep next to him but i didn't so i told him to come to my bed but he didn't cause he thought i was already sleeping when he got up to come to me lol   Also next morning he was making jokes with me like teasing me.

20090219150639AAZ3VwO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to choose!?	I'm 17 and i have been dating the same guy for 2 1/2 years. To make things easier we'll call him Bob. I love Bob of course but i don't know if its in a relationship type of way. A month or so ago i met a guy who is perfect in my eyes. His name will be Joe. And he can help bring me back to the kind of girl i was before i was with Bob. I have really strong feelings for him and i haven't felt this way in a long time. I get butterflies in my stomach when i see him! And Bob isn't exactly the perfect guy, not for me anyways. He doesn't have future plans and he doesnt care about hardly anything i care about, and all my friends think he's a bad influence. I tried breaking up with him yesterday in a friendly way and he just started bawling practically. He told me that he was at his height of his passion for me and he didnt want to lose me. I didnt know he felt that way and now i don't know what to do. Should i stay with the guy who can make me happy sometimes, just cause i dont want him to be hurt? Should i go with Joe, because to me he is perfect and its a sure thing? And i've never cheated on Bob before, but Joe is so tempting and i cant be sure that a wont do something with him. I need help before i lose them both.

I know how she loves surprises, but since she's super busy these days, we don't get to see each other often... So I was thinking about making her a package of her favorite stuff, maybe a rose and a cute note. But here's the catch... She's a professor and works in a high school... There have been rumors about her being gay, so showing up there is not a solution. Plus... even if I stopped someone on the street and asked him to deliver it to her, what are the chances of getting a package into a school without anyone thinking...

I met this guy (who's 19) in December through the internet. He hinted he liked me, and when I told him about my problem, the reason I hadn't had a boyfriend before, he was all like, why does that stop you being happy?      :S that threw me for a week, no one had ever been so unqestionningly accepting of me :S      this was so weird for me. so we talked all the time and flirted and so on, and he was like, I want to be your other half... do I qualify? and i said yes and blah blah blah... he's been referring to me as his girlfriend and I talk to him on the phone and I really do like him      the problem is, he lives an hour away from me (by car) so we haven't actually met yet. We were supposed to go out on Valentine's day around London, but he was called in to work.      I don't know what to do ... he says he loves me :S ... but, like, when I've made my mind up to just give up, I sign on to msn and he's all like, i've missed you, and so on.      then when i hint that i wanna see him, he goes yeah, me too...       but doesn't actually make an effort to arrange a meeting or anything.       I can't help feeling like he's just feeling sorry for me or something.      he IS in the middle of moving into a new flat, so I guess it could be that, but I'm just so paranoid.       he is constantly on my mind and I don't know what to do....      help?

I mean I had a girl tell me she loved me the next day she spent the only time we had together talking to another guy. Same with my girlfriend,( ex- now) she said I love you to me. I never said it back because then I would've been lying. Then I broke up with her politely and she was acting ok at first and suddenly got pissed and started cussin' me out, giving my number to freaks, and now shes all "Oh let's be friends I didn't mean what I said I was mad". Please tell me why?

20090219131403AA0tanR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies! Help me understand!?	ok let me give you some info...im confused and am looking for some help!!!      we've hooked up, and she told me that she feels something special with me. She tells me she feels comfortable and "loves to cuddle" with me. she told me i'm "taking down every barrier" she's set up for herself after a very hard break up she had 6 months ago.      She texts and calls all the time when we cant be together, and always tells me that she "feels something real" with me.       She tells me all these really nice things, and then goes to parties that are renowned for the sexual interaction within. It leaves me dumbfounded that she'd rather go there than be with me if she really feels this way about me. I really have strong feelings for her.      So my question is what does this all mean? Is my heart too big and I'm seeing something thats not there or am i getting mixed signals? thanks.

20090219123739AA2leua	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i call him? or just let it be.....?	Okay so Jan 2008 i met this one kid and we totally hit it offf! I AM SO STUPID not to ever give him a chance because trust me he was every girls dream! We had alot in common, he was the sweetest guy.   examples; he knew i had trouble waking up in the morning and EVERY morning he'd call me at 6am to make sure i got up. He'd stay up with me, always make me laugh. Well he had to leave out of state for 3 months and i thought about him every minute, BUT i couldn't talk to him or write him or anything....during that time i got back with my boyfriend of 2 years and turned out they had gone to the same elementary, weird huh! anyways, so this guy found out that i had a boyfriend and got hurt and we still talked but he WAS to perfect for me, i know that sounds absurd but true! Girls would kill for this guy, anyways he waited for me for 7 months and he started using drugs and he got really in to them and i felt as if it was my fault, he got like messed up, and one day he called some people and made up alot of rumors about me. It was horrible and i was so mad, i called him and said very mean things to him, and changed my number.      I still think about him, because i think i was in love with him and i cared so much about him and i just want to call him and just talk, BUT should i even apologize? shouldn't he? I'm still with my boyfriend so should i try and forget about this boy?   i also wonder if he has tried calling to apologize, but i changed my number so i worry everyday      *and fyi im 18, hes 17.....so yea, if that matters??

20090219125023AA21ijJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are these normal feelings for a guy after he is rejected?	So I asked her out for valentines day and she said yes then ignored me for two days and texted me saying we were better off friends.  At first I was really hurt and stuff but im starting to get over it.  I feel like were not even friends because its still difficult for me to talk to her in the one class we have together  Now I feel as if I will never have a girlfriend because im still a pretty shy guy.        I need some way to boost my confidence so that I can be good friends with her without making it awkward or anything.        I get extremely frustrated when I see many other people my age with girlfriends and stuff.  i think the main thing that I am missing is the self confidence it takes to put yourself out there.      I know this is a problem for many guys and those of you that have overcome it, how can I?   and girls what is the best way for a guy that you dont know to approach you and talk about stuff?

20090219115124AAXGwtN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my "girlfriend" really love me?	Okay, there's this girl that i strongly care for, but i'm not so sure she really loves me the way she says she does. We're a pretty complicated couple, were not really going out because she is afraid that i will turn abusive and or fall out of love and break up within the first few months. She treats me as a boyfriend when we're not in public but when we are in public she acts as if friends is all were gonna be. I mean she'll say she loves me and she'll give me really long romantic hugs in public, but she acts like a completely different person when we're at school. I noticed that recently she very rarely answers the phone, ever since valentines day... she says she'll call me or that she'll call me back but never does, she leaves me hangin. We do from time to time have arguments, but we always work things out within a day. but ever since valentines, things have been really weird, i was really upset, and about to break up with her, because she said she "forgot that i wanted to do anything valentines" until Friday night, and then ended up hangin out with some other guy that everyone says she likes besides me. She totally ignored all my phone calls throughout Saturday and Sunday. so i wrote a long txt explaining that the relationship isn't working out, and that if she really cares, she'd at least try to change a few things that are upsetting me. Every time i ask to hang out after school she gives an excuse as to why she can't. she knows i cant hang out on weekends because im grounded. Is she really into me or is she playing games?

I asked him why he dump me and he told me "I want only a real relationship and not long distance" then he said, "if you really want me to be happy then come find me".

20090219105026AAWiOrI	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I help my best friend get out of the lifestyle she's in?	Let me start of by saying, I'm a 18 year old female and I'm about to graduate and go onto college. I have a best friend who I've been friends with since we were 4, so she's basically like a sister to me.    When we were 15, we both went through that rebellious stage, and she started dating this 23 year old guy. & then she kept getting into trouble at school so her mom pulled her out and she hasn't been back since. She still dates that guy, and they live alone together in a nasty apartment. But she only has an 8th grade education and she has only had one job. Also, her boyfriend is almost 400lbs! She used to be 115, but in the time shes been with him shes gained weight and is up to 130 because all they eat is fried chicken, frozen pizzas, and beer. And they both smoke like chimneys. Everytime I go see her I get so depressed because I hate seeing her live like that. I want to help her so bad. She tells me sometimes that she doesnt want to live with him anymore, but she feels obligated to take care of him, and she doesn't have anyone else to live with because her dads an alcoholic and her mom is living with someone else and just had a baby. So she feels trapped. I told her she could come stay with me, but she doesnt want to move (I'm 3 hours away)....I FEEL LIKE IM WATCHING HER SLOWLY DIE & I want to help but HOWW??      Thanks.

20090219105926AAuaTBp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, what would you do?	I get turned on when I see a girl play with her shoes, slipping them on and off, dangling them, etc. I can't help it and I don't know why. Anyways, I'm thinking about telling my girlfriend about it who I've been seeing for four months now. She is always playing with her shoes out of habit and I'm always trying to hide the fact that I like to watch her do this. So to help me decide whether or not I should tell her that her shoeplay turns me on, if your boyfriend told you this how would you react? Would you be upset or would you go along with it and play with your shoes more just to turn him on? Would you have wanted to know?

My POTENTIAL BF is REALLY shy, and so my friends, and even some of my guy friends were just like "go for it, hes too shy to ask you out." So I swallowed my pride and asked him out. His reply was bitter sweet to say the least, he told me he REALLY wanted to go out with me, but that he had a really complicated life right now and he had to wait a while. So I waited, it's been a while, so finally i began to wonder.       So in curiosity, and pure aggitation I asked him WHEN we were going to start going out, and that I couldn't wait forever. His reply was:   I'll surprise you      What does that mean??? It's not that i don't like surprises, but in this situation...I HATE surprises.

20090219111926AALDBL1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I setting myself up for heartbreak?	I posted this in singles and dating, but I got too many answers from children.... Im hoping someone on here has had a similar experience, or can give their insight.      I have started dating someone again... we are going on 5 months. We met last summer and have been inseparable ever since.      However, there are two issues. One being that my last relationship was super rocky - with a younger guy cheating on me with his ex girlfriend for the whole 5 months I was with him, totally ripping my heart out and putting me through a real tough time. Therefore, I automatically think every guy is going deceive me like he did. Trust issues is the biggest thing.      The other huge issue is all his baggage that has created him into who he is. First off, he has a 4 year old daughter who he sees every other weekend and random days through the week. He is a great dad... but the daughter's mother and him have had a VERY long history of 11 years. She admitted to getting pregnant by him on purpose, while they were broken up... they dated on and off - she was his first real girlfriend. He dated one other woman, and then went back to his kids mother when it ended. Apparently they slept together again earlier last year before we met. He swears that he is done with her, and everything he ever did with her was a mistake. Tells me that he should have let her go so long ago, but he didnt learn his mistake until this past year. He swears to never get back together with her even if we werent together.      He sees me in his future and he tells me he wants me in his life for good. That to him, this is the real deal.      Now here I am struggling with my trust issues, trying like mad to be comfortable in someone's life who's past would make anyone doubt where they belong in it.      How do I make all the pieces fit and put things all together? Is there any way something this complicated could work for someone with such trust issues like myself? Or am I setting myself up for failure?

20090219114609AANJ0Dr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think is going on with him? 10 points!?	This guy and I met online through a friend of ours. I live in Miami and he lives in Seattle. We started out as friends just talking and within a few days, we couldn't stop talking to eachother. We were chatting for up to 10 hours straight. What I noticed is that he REALLY liked to talk to me (and I the same with him) and he didn't like not talking to me. So whenever I didn't talk to him, he of course, had to start the conversation. We exchanged numbers after about a little over a week and began texting a lot. If I stopped texting, he would ask why. He then told me how much he liked me and how he wished we lived closer. I felt the same. He was even telling his friends about me. After about a week of talking on the phone, he wouldnt reply to my texts. Then 2 days later, he told me that it was best to move on and that he really liked me but he wouldnt be able to have a serious relationship with someone so far away. I agreed with him. But we started talking again. Not as much as before. There were days where I wouldnt text him and he would text me asking why I havent. Then a week later, I decided to let a day pass where we didnt talk. That very next day, I got a text from this number I didn't know telling me to stop talking to her boyfriend. I found out this was his ex-gf from 2 years ago. She started to harass me to where I had to tell her to leave me alone and let the guy deal with it. IThe same thing happened to our friend in Indiana. The girl had wrote her to leave the guy alone. ts been a week and I still havent heard from him.   What is going on?!

20090219122234AA8IxQa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is our relationship doing good or bad?	My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a month now, and we started our relationship off very quickly. We started off by just planning to hook up, then we realized afterward that we enjoyed each-others company enough to feel something between us. We've already had sex and she's just starting to worry about us taking it too quickly, which we pretty much are.       This is the first serious relationship either of us have had and I've pretty much put my all into it so far so a break up would hurt fairly bad. She got put on restriction two weeks ago and we don't have school this week so we've seen fairly little of each-other but maybe it's for the best to slow us down a bit, though she gets off restriction this Sunday. Since she's been put on restriction I've missed her really, really bad and I'm worried she's going to come out of this feeling not-so-good about the relationship and end it. What can I do to help keep the relationship afloat / make it better? Thanks in advance for any help.
20090219132545AA4IzCZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls that go to clubs have any interest in relationships?	I met this girl at a club on valentines day night. We ended up dancing for the longest time. i also made out with her. at the end of the night i got her number. At first i figured it all happened because it was valentines day and all. But i proceeded to call her anyway two days later (MONDAY). She answered the phone and we talked close to 20 minutes. I asked her if she would like to go out this saturday for a couple of drinks and get to know each other. she said yes, she would like to. I also told her that i would call her Friday (tomorrow) to make definite plans. Do you think that she would still be interested in going out?

20090219122843AAcZSBM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Are these actual signs of interest in another guy?	Alright, so I'm slightly confused on this. I know this girl and have for awhile now, but these signals recently showed up from her. I'm not entirely sure if they are signals, so your opinion would be very helpful :D      So to start off, these signals were never sent before. I never would have even thought that this girl would be interested in me. What happened yesterday was we were painting and I was putting some paint on a pallet. I couldn't entirely figure out how to put it on, so she held my hand and did the motion for me. I thought it weird that she did that, but I don't really know if she was just showing me how to do it or wanted to touch my hand.      She also has been talking to me more lately, but is always slightly shy when she does. She has a very funny personality, but kind of shrinks away from it when I look at her or talk to her. She sat next to me today when she could've sat in her original spot, too, cuz her friend wasn't sitting next to her. And she got excited when she found out I was in her group on a project, as did her friend. She smiled and was like, "Yay," but not in a sarcastic way at all.       So I don't know if I should pay attention to this or just ignore it. What do you guys think?

After half year from the time we met i found out that he has a gf so i broke up with him even though it hurt. I stopped talking to him but he kept calling and messaging that he wants me and the other girl is not his gf but just a friend so in a way we ended up being more of friends with benefits. I thought I was cool with it, even thou was wrong. But now i realize how much I want him not just in bed but in general to spend time with him but he doesn't. He wants our relationship casual and light, whether I want us to be a couple. How can I make him love me and want to be with me. I need this. He has never mentioned the other girl anymore so I'm not sure if they are together or not . Pls guysssssssssssssss tell me what to dooooooo cuz is driving me crazy. He never wants to talk about feelings with me and Im just wondering if is too late to try to be back like at the beginning.

20090219124505AACcdKO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy acting real strange...?	So there's this guy my age (almost 16) at school and I really like him. I tried for the last 6 months to get closer to him bit by bit and him to notice me. His friends already recognize me and I fell like a part of his close group of friends - which makes me happy :).    So the problem is like this: There are some days that he's like totally ignoring me - not in a bad way, but like before we knew each other. sometimes I even think he's trying to avoid me..   On the other hand, there are days that he keeps kissing me on the chick and my hair like a boyfriend would do you know? like really sweet and loving ones, also holding me tight and feeling possessive.   I know for sure he isn't a player - he is so totally not that person. But i'm really confused.. what's up with him? Does he like me or not..?Thanks :)

20090219125702AAZmhe5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is chronically ill and depressed, How do I keep it from effecting my mental health?	My husband has been depressed for years now and is always sick with some ailment and chronic pain that no one can seem to figure out. We have thousands of dollars in doctor bills and no answers. He never wants to go to work and I always fear he will loose his job because of lost time at work. The last few years our marriage of almost 18 years has been on the rocks because of these problems and it only makes his depression and pain worse. I feel terrible and don't know where to turn anymore. Ive tried to talk to him about anti depressants but he thinks Im just putting his pain down. Any suggestions??
20090219125207AA7ygMd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I get so nervous around this guy?	I knew this guy for awhile in middle school and we liked each other. Its been a few years now and we've both just now admitted that we liked each other.(this was online) But then he started acting weird by saying really corny stuff that i know isn't true. But still I was excited because I kinda liked him and he was saying he wished he could hang out with me. Then the next morning when i said i would see him at school I woke up gagging and I haven't eaten anything since. I have to go to school tomorrow and im afraid the same thing will happen. Is it possible that i feel this way because i don't really like him or am i really just nervous about seeing him? Please help! Thankss.

20090219125322AAdoZAv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The other night I had just fallen asleep, and I woke up to my boyfriend touching me.?	We've been together for almost a year, and it's not like we aren't "active" almost every other day. Back to the point though, I felt it (he was actually inside of me, fondling me with his fingers) and I woke up, and he then proceeded to act like her was sleeping. I asked him what he was doing and he didn't admit to it at first until he knew that I was dead-set aware. I really don't know what to think. And this isn't the first time it has happened. To me, it doesn't make it normal because he isn't asleep while he's doing it, he's wide awake and fully aware. I've already told him NEVER to do that. It honestly creeps me out and scares me... Maybe there isn't an actual answer for this... I just need help.. What do you think?
20090219125340AAJWBua	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he acting like this?	Ok, a friend of mine tried to fix me up with a guy that she works with and he asked for a pic of me, and I gave him a few. The thing is that he wasn't suppose to keep any of them, but he ended up keeping one. To make a long story short, he told me that I was really pretty to him. There were two separate occasions that we were suppose to go out and meet and he stood me up on both occasions. Then when I try to call him out on it he doesn't have an answer for it or either he'll ignore my calls and texts. So since he can't keep his promise, I wrote him a text telling him that I wanted him to give me my picture back since he can't seem to keep him promise whenever we talk about meeting up...again...he ignored it. So to fastforward, the girl that works with him told him the first thing this morning that I wanted my picture back, and she stated hat he acted as if he got mad, and said that he was acting like he was going to his car to go get it, but then when he came back that he didn't have the picture with him and said that he wasn't giving it back. I already told him that it would have been best if we could be friends because he can't seem to keep his promises, and I don't like people that don't do what they say they'll do, and he clearly isn't a man of his word. So my question is, in your opinion, why isn't he giving me my pic back??      Also he told the girl that tried to hook us up that I was acting "crazy" with him. All I did was call him out on his bullcrap. If you say that you are going to do something, then do it!! Don't lie about it...      So what's the problem????!! HELP!!!
20090219125435AAaIyv7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do in dishonesty?	I recently married in October.  My husband and I went to talk with the minister who was going to do the wedding.  This is a normal proceeding before he will marry 2 people.  He discusses many things that can damage a marriage and especially if it is your second marriage.  he ask a question of both of us and it was , "is there anything that you have not been honest about with each other"  he told us that if there is you had better get it out, because eventually someone , somewhere will tell it and it will be much harder to deal with then.  I had suspected something that happened while we were dating and seemed serious...but my husband denied anything and he almost came to tears during this time.  He had gotten saved 2 weeks before.  Since that time about a month ago I ask him if he would tell me the truth if I asked him a question, he said yes.  I asked about a trip he and some friends took without me about a week before he ask me to move in with him..which is wrong, but I did it   I asked him about this trip and he told me he did sleep with this lady...he told me that he was afraid if he had told me before the marriage I would have left him.  I told him, I would have...now I cant seem to get this off my mind...it hurts me very much.  I know I am to forgive him, but this is very difficult for me.  I was married 35 years the first time.  My husband is 14 years younger than me and I do think he loves me.  I just don't want to be an idiot....

20090219131123AA4F8wa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this situation?	My ex boyfriend and I have been broken up since almost 2 yrs ago. He has been in and out of relationships but haven't lasted long. He recently have contacted and been talking for over 2 months. He even told me he wanted me to be his wife. I have to mention also that he is in the Army and is currently in Iraq and will be out around June of this year. Ok the problem is that recently I have felt that he is being indifferent with me. He adds girls on myspace and talks to them. I mentioned this to him and he just said they were girls that adds him and leaves him comments. I got mad at him and told him why would he say he wants to marry me and be talking to other girls I even told him that he should just leave me alone since I don't want to play games or waste anymore time. He said that he only wants to be with me and only me.I sent him a comment stating that I didnt see me on his tops but he didnt say anything about it an didnt put me. Also to add...... on his myspace he had he was only there for friends but now he added dating and serious relationships. He also seems to call me less. I mentioned that to him today but he said that he didnt noticed he was being indifferent with me. What could this all mean? I have thought that maybe hes bored since I cant talk to him all day long cause I work and go to school but I dont think that makes it right because I don't do anything like that. He's the only guy I talk to. I been feeling really down and depressed with this whole situation. What should I do? I'm 22 yrs old and I don't want to waste anymore time with this guy even though I love him with all my heart!

20090219131846AAIEvM2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell my bf my current thoughts about our relationship or wait it out?	We've been together for over a year, half of which would be considered casual dating until we 'consummated' the deal. Lately, I've been having thoughts about the future of our relationship and where it is really headed. I am in my early thirties and he is in his late twenties. We have alot in common. He is very driven, passionate and focused on his goals, so much so that it consumes him at times. I am the same about the things that are important to me, which are not exactly in line with his. At times I wonder if we are both too independent to really connect with one another. When we do connect it is beautiful and very intimate, but other times I feel like we are at opposite ends of the world. I also fear that I might disappoint him if I am not as passionate about the same things as him. I do have some interest, so I participate, but I am not as passionate about the follow up activities. I hold back a little in telling him and sort of wait until the event or situation passes and my feelings/thought slide under the radar. But, I obviously cannot go on like this forever. As I am writing this, I seem to be drawing some conclusions of my own, but I would appreciate some feedback if anyone has anything to share. Have you been in a similar situation, can you relate?

Hi   The other night I got 2 guys numbers and one of theme is really sweet and good looking and then other one is also really sweet.  They both think that I'm hot and keep telling me.     The problem is that a) my mate likes the first one, b) there is another guy who likes me that I've gone on a few "dates" with and he told a few of my mates that we aren't official (as far as I know he hasn't even asked me if I want to be labeled as unofficially taken) and c) the first two guys are really good mates but they don't know about the third guy and he doesn't know about them.

20090219133829AAJUDsI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	~ Need Advice On Girl I Like in School...?	OK, here's the deal...      There's this girl I sort of like who goes to the same college as me. I think she's really cute and she was in my lab last semester, and even though I noticed her and talked to her a few times last semester. I didn't get around to asking her out for many reasons...      One of it was our lab was only once a week and sometimes we'll go without seeing each other for more than a couple of weeks. So the vibe wasn't right...      But, this semester of all the people I run into, it's her ( Is it fate or what? I don't believe it fate or luck. But how lucky am I? lol)!      This semester she takes the math class after me and I see her sometimes when I'm walking to my math class. But, again, we don't run into each other on a consistent basis. So we can't really talk. But I really want to get to know her better...      So my question is:      - Should I just ask her out? How, it's not a guarantee we'll run into each other?       - What's the best way to do so with the scenerio I just described?      - We say, "Hi!" "How u doing?" When we see each other around campus. But how do I know she's into me?      Any other tips? Thanks!

20090219133915AAGv8pJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need tips on How to salvage any type of relationship  may I have had with this woman!?	I asked this question before here but it did not garner the response that I needed to fix my problem, as I need to find out how to talk to this girl. So here it goes again:      There was this girl who volunteered at Columbia University's GED program, and since she left I can't stop thinking about her. She was this cute petite Asian girl with a great personality and everyone seemed to like her. Now in my defense everyone acts a bit creepy when they're attracted to someone. What made me notice her is how nice and patient she was to those she taught (people with less than a 5th grade reading/writing level) , and she was really easy going and social, which I'm not. Well here is where my problem begins. Since I couldn't get her out of my system, and since she is in London studying medicine, I kind of cyber stalked her and found her photobucket and facebook account. Since no one knew that I was into her (since I pretty much turned mute when she'd speak to me) this was the only way I could see her. Anyway her friend saw it on my laptop one day and I quickly got nervous and shut it. The next day her facebook was set to private (although not her photobook). Do you think she knows, and if so, did I miss my chance at asking her out? I really like her, and I think she is my perfect girl that I can really date. What should I do?! I need to know how to explain what I was doing without coming off as creepy. So please, no judgment, folks. Also, how can I ask her friends for her e-mail now that they know that I did that? I can't let her go! From what I know about her, and just seeing her being incredibly kind to people (we volunteered at the same soup kitchen together) I want to start over and just show her who I am. This is really killing me knowing that I missed my chance. Please help! Also, based on her photos here  http://s730.photobucket.com/albums/ww306...  would she be out of my league? People have told me that I look like a young Matthew Broderick.

I thought he was cute so I wanted to get to know him more. I'm really good friends with his best friend (we'll call his best friend Kevin)! So his best friend asked me if I liked him and I said ya... and he went and told him like right away.       So ever since like February me and bob have been talking on the phone every other night. He's cool with me liking him and he sometimes asks me about it and stuff. He also flirts with me too.    So kevin said that bob liked me so I was happy!! But yesterday night we were hanging out and he basically ignored me. I'm confused though cause he talks to me so well on the phone but for the past 3 weeks he hasn't been talking to me in person well.       Last night he would keep tickling me and blame it on my friend. Then  one of my friends and I were gonna leave we said we were leaving and bob and his other friend didn't even say anything I said bye "guys" 3 times wen they finally looked up from playing their stupid guitars and said oh ok. My friend that I was leaving with was like don't you guys even care we're leaving? They didn't answer And I said whatever let's just leave they're friggin jerk faces that got bob to look up and then we left. I told kevin everything that happened with bob and he doesn't know what's up. Should I keep liking him or forget about him?

20090219140957AAaFFvO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He says he doesnt love me anymore but considers me his best friend?	So I have been dating this wonderful amazing guy for almost a year now. Its very strange to explain to you guys how close we got over the past year. We use to spend all our time together.... go out ....both of us are very social being. It was amazing. Sex was great - the chemistry as mindblowing....but after from that we really connected.       Trust me when I say this isnt just in my mind.... he felt it too as he would tell me and his best friend about it all the time.    Then last month things got a bit weird....its not he wont spend time with me - that remained same but we didnt have sex.... he would hug me and go to sleep.... he seemed a bit distant as in he is pulling himself away from me.       I have always believe in an open communication - so I asked. He said he loves everymin he spends with me but that loving feeling is gone... He cares for me the most... still wants me in his life.... cant imagine living without me but not as a lover but as a freind.       I m trying so much to hate him for doing this but i cant seem to. I dont understand how can he just not love me anymore.

20090219144629AAaqzgC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Will he ever improve?	I am a female in my early thirties. Have been seeing someone for four months now. The problem is that whenever we go out, we always split the bill. Wherever we go, dinner, cinema, theatre etc, it's always split halfway. He hardly ever treats me to anything. The only time he ever got me anything was on my birthday, he gave me twenty pounds in gift vouchers and paid for dinner. He doesn't believe in Valentine's Day, I suspect that's because he doesn't want to spend any cash.       Splitting the cost didn't bother me very much when we first started dating, but it does bother me now, as we are four months into the relationship and no longer just dating. I'm not saying that I expect him to pay for everything all of the time, but it would be nice to be treated to something once in a while. Even when we go to the cinema, he never offers to buy any popcorn. I once asked him if he wanted any popcorn, and he replied that he doesn't like it. But the problem is that he didn't even offer to get some for me.      Also, I feel that his attitude towards money is bringing out the worst in me, as I am usually quite a generous person, but because he is being stingy with me, it makes me behave in a similar way towards him.

20090219151321AASQ8pX	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should I do guys?	My parter and I share an apartment together.  Currently I pay 100% of the rent and bills, and am also doing 100% of the saving for our overseas holiday next month (which was a gift from his parents)      My partner is due to start Uni in June, but has been on the dole since November last year since his last job paid him the exact same amount!  He figures since he will  have to leave a full time job when he attends uni, casual work for the moment will pay him the same amount as the dole, so he might as well enjoy his free time.... I figured fair enough!        He does all the cleaning and cooks me dinner when I get home... so I always jokingly call him my house wife.  He makes sure I dont need to do anything cleaning wise after work, as he doesnt think its fair since I work all day.      Currently I am only just scraping by with all the saving and paying all of our expenses.  Last night my parter got paid, and while I was asleep he went to the casino.  He had a great time, drank a lot, gambled a lot and in the end came out $20 up... so didnt loose any money.      But when I found out this morning, I felt really upset and let down in a way.  Even though its his money, I feel like Im the one at work all day, paying for everything.. and he is living a life of luxury and gambling away money we could be saving for overseas...      He gets really upset and touchy on the subject of being unemployed and staying home all day, but I feel like this could be the beginning of the end if I dont say something about how it makes me feel.      How can I approach this subject???      PS: I dont want to leave him.  Please dont write that as an answer...

We were basically an unnamed couple. well then january came along and i had so much stress with school, family, friends, etc. well she started to despise me  and because she thought i was changing into a different person. I never told her the kind of stress i had. so february came along and my stress ended but she just continued to hate me. Then one day she gave me this long note explaining everything she hated about me. Well i explained why i was acting so weird and now we're good friends again. I asked her to this ball last tuesday, she said yes then on wedensday she said she wouldnt then on friday i gave her something for v day and this other guy who gives her rides everywhere and is obsessed with her asks her and she said yes! i just want to kill this guy and im trying so hard to get her to like me again. I really dont want her to be with this sophomore and she "isnt sure if she likes him(sophomore)" (she told her best friend that). So now im just like so depressed and im really trying to get her back   Any advice?   AT ALL    any insite at all is fine    thanks a lot

20090219165822AAPqLij	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why don't I love him ?	Okay so last year i went to a biker festival called Iron Ore, I met a lad there and i fell for him i guess, but on the night (That we met) i didn't tell him.      From then and January he was constantly on my mind.       January was when we got into contact again and within two weeks he asked me out and i screamed yes ^^      (Okay this is turning out to be some kind of love story ... Heh aaanyway)      We met up again in January about a week or more after he asked me out, we'd been talking on msn and on the phone and such, and i was a bit nervous so i took my friend along and we had a great time.      Then we met again in february and i just didn't feel like .. Well like i loved him.   We held hands, snuggled into each other because it was bloody freezing lol and yeah.   After i went back home (Yes we live in different places me in lancashire and him in cumbria) i found out the news that one of my old friends had died which i took pretty bad, but he (the guy) - he wasn't very supportive - at all, I told him that one of my friends had passed away and his responce was simply   "oh"    then he went on and talked about his new game ..   Me being well .. a push over I just let it fly by.   But i don't know he just seems more like a friend now.   Maybe not even that.      Maybe I rushed into things ?      Has anyone got any ways that i could say something like that i just want to be friends ..    Or anyways that i could.. i dont know get to love him again /:   Obviously thats not possible but ..   Help ?

20090219152526AA8a2fR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this guy I like?	Okay this is pretty complicated...   I like this guy he is 24 and I am 18.. I've known him for over a year..problem is he lives about 3 hours away right now,    so I only get to see him every so often..and to top it off he is one of my brother in-laws best friends.   He talks to me everyday on IM and we always have conversations..some times 'til 2 or 3 am.   Even if he has to go to work in the morning.. Well, this last weekend on Valentines day My sister wanted to go see her husband (who works overseas) in between work.who was    staying at his friends house ..the guy I like.. So I decided to come along..everything was great we we're hanging out having fun with his friends at his   apartment..after all his friends left and my sister and her husband went to bed it was just me and him. this was about 3:30 in the morning..so we had a   few drinks and talked until 5am....I wanted him to kiss me so bad..nothing happened..he didn't even say anything about liking me.but I felt like I sensed it a bit .we just went to bed ..so I figured he didn't like me..   so the next day I backed way off and got scared I guess...I didn't want to look stupid and act like I like him if he didn't like me back. That would only   make things awkard! So I didn't talk to him to much the next day..we just hung out with my sister and bro-inlaw.. So now.. last night I was talking with my sister    and I guess he had told my bro-in law THAT NIGHT he thought that I was flirting with him and my bro in law said No..she just makes    jokes alot and laughs and she's drunk..which wasn't true I was flirting with him '''GUILTY''' lol.    but after we had left the next night him and my brother in law   were hanging out and the guy I like said that yeah I think you are right she wasn't flirting with me.. I was just reading the signals wrong..    (((because of the next day we hung out I didn't say much to him, because I thought he didnt like me))) My brother in-law was telling him   that he needed to get back into dating again and he said "yeah I know...its too bad your little sister isn't old enough to date.."          I know all this because my sister tells me everything and her husband tells her everything lol..   I hate this whole does he like me/not stuff I am sure he might feel the same way with me...its pure torture...because I really like him..a lot..   But I don't know what to do because next weekend I am going to his place again for the weekend because its his birthday..   I just wished there wasn't such a big age gap..then he wouldn't feel like it was wrong to like me :(
20090219162224AAyUQ5V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do You Think Hes Interested In Me?

20090219164226AA2hNOq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I in love with my boyfriend?	My boyfriend and I have been together for awhile now. We've been through so much with each other. We've lost our virginity to each other. He thinks I'm amazing and I feel the same way about him. He said he dreams about me. I can't stop thinking about him and I odn't want to. We want to spend the rest of our lives together. We tell each other everything like our dreams and our feelings towards one another. He can always makes me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. He's sweet,funny,smart,sensitive,caring. I'v ebeen hurt so many times before so I have trust issues but I trust him completly. I care about him more than words can explain. Every time we hug I feel safe and warm. When we're together I don't see or care about any one else besides him. Nothing seams to matter now that he's a part of my life. He holds a special place in my heart. Our eyes always light up when we're together. When we're driving in his car and we're sitting there in silence he looks over at me and says "You're so pretty." That always put a smile on my face and it makes my heart melt. He leaves me cute little text messages that say "I miss you." and other stuff. He tells me he loves everything about me. He said he's falling in love with me and it feels incredible. He said he wanted to look me straight in the eyes Saturday and tell me he loves me for the first time but he got really nervous. I told him their was nothing to be nervous about and I would of said it back. He told me he whispered it to himself. We both get this over whelming feeling that signal love whenever we're together. I feel like I want to go outside and scream "I love Tommy!" so everyone can hear it. I just wanted to know if this sounds like we're in love or just lust? I really want to make sure I mean it before I say it because it's a big deal. I never knew I could feel this way about any one in my life. I don't need smart comments that say "If you really were in love you wouldn't be asking a bunch or straingers" etc. Thank you to every one who answers.      -Caitlin.

20090219155019AACwP5S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, do you date more than one guy at a time?	Ive been dating this girl a couple months. Her friend tells me she's "smitten" and I really like her too but we aren't officially exclusive or anything. Personally, I dont date more than one person and have never even LIKED more than one person at a time. Everyone's different though. If she is "smitten" is it likely that she could be dating multiple people? She seems really in to me and affectionate I just don't want to get played and I don't think its a good time to ask her if we're exclusive yet. How many of you date multiple people? Do you date multiple people if you are "smitten" over one person in particular?

20090219155300AAkdLnw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think that this scene is sweet but still maybe a little too close for comfort...?	I grew up in a family that didnt show much affection with eachother and because of that, Im not real sure about what is and is not appropriate when showing affection for a family member. I seen this movie Total Eclipse and near the end they seem to have a real sweet scene between the brother and sister but I thought it might have been a little wierd too. what happened was the brother (who was 36) gets his leg amputated and is sent home to be taken care of by his sister (who is around 29 or 30) and this one scene the sister comes in the room because he had been calling for her to come upstairs where he is in bed and he is completely delerious and asks her if she sees the carriges driving in the sky (this movie was set for the 1890's) and whenever she realizes he is delerious she runs over and places her palm on his forehead to check for a fever then slides her hand down his face. the then sits down beside of him and takes his hand in hers and strokes his arm with her other hand while they talk, saying things like:   him : I have to help people you see? its my duty   her : I know you do   him : I dont want money unless its drenched in blood!   her :Shhh   him :maybe the sea will wash away the stains?   her : maybe   she then slides the hand that was stroking his arm down his face and then goes back to stroking his arm again then they say:   him: there's one thing Isabelle you must promise me, its very important will you promise?   her: what?   him: never let them amputate   she looks at him sadly then from a certain angle of the camera it looks like she lifted his hand that she's been holding and kisses it. he then takes her in his arms and they both hold eachother tight. It seems like a sweet brother/sister scene but I wasnt sure if maybe it was a little too much or not. what do you think?

20090219152228AA9snYh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I keep getting nervous. help me!?	Thanks for all answers in Advance. Theirs this guy, that i really like. At first we didn't know eachother i just seen him around. But we do have mutual friends. So lately we haven't been talking convo. wise, but we do greet eachother and say hi. Yesturday he grabbed my hand. Today he gave me a kiss on the cheek, he only did that though becuz my friend was sitting next to me, that he's friends with. they see eachother he kisses her as usual, I was there so he kissed me to but just to be nice. & when he was leaving he said bye everybody & was all in my face. I dared myself not to look. so i was looking not in his eyes but my friends did realize he was looking at me leaving. THE PROBLEM IS.. everytime we said hi before, I never seemed intrested saying hi. but deep down I LOVED when he said hi.. lol, i hate acting like this though, like trying to act normal. but the more i act normal the more i send off signels like im distant & greet back without being cheerful. Because usually ANY BODY that says hi to me Im usually nice too with a big smile & everything. BUT NOT HIM. and I really like him.. SOOO what do u think? i know i need to loosin up, but i really don't want him finding out i like him, cuz personally i don't think he will like me back IDK. but my opinion about that can change, If i can smile next time when he greets me. but HELP!
