W4BvABL6aa	Yah,   ..  what bronwen said...  <br>  A .. .. ..  I'm going to say a dead one, hear; .. Serge Gainsbourg<br>  A2 .. .. .  A cosmic country pedal steel guitar player.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/the-ballad-of-sneaky-pete-a-gu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Fe...</a><br>  <br>  Dam-it He is dead too. The concept is still alive.<br>  <br>  BA ... Now  but when 10 not so much|`|AA10246871	You know, I spent five years of my childhood in Chile, so I am well-acquainted with Mr. Iglesias. I had some of his records as a kid.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go so far as to do any horizontal dancing with him, but perhaps it's a holdover from my childhood--I am a total sucker for any man who speaks English with a Spanish accent (which explains my ongoing fascination with Antonio Banderas). I think vocal coaches who work with people to help them lose Spanish inflections in their speech should be shot.<br>  <br>  I know people of all ages who are huge fans--it's probably wise that he decided to start singing stuff in English, allowing him to reach a new audience. It's great what a good manager can do for your career (though his wasn't exactly suffering when he sang in Spanish only...)<br>  <br>  My favorite "sex fiend" musician? Don't know that I have one, but I do love the fact that David Bowie has said more than once that he met his first wife because they were in bed "f*****g the same bloke." The way I first read it in an interview when I was a kid, the bloke got up to go to the bathroom and when he came back, Mr. Bowie and the future Mrs. Bowie were too interested in each other to let him back in bed. What a great way to meet a spouse!<br>  <br>  Ideas for other living legends? <br>  <br>  --Mark Knopfler--he writes such interesting "story songs," and has said he does so because in truth he's not really that interesting, and singing those songs allows him to take on different personas. <br>  <br>  --Ryuichi Sakamoto--it isn't just about soundtracks for him--he does all sorts of interesting composing, including dance music, plus, his daughter's a Japanese Pop Princess. He's also got an Oscar sitting around his house somewhere...<br>  <br>  --Ennio Morricone--the guy's a damn genius. Can you imagine a Sergio Leone spaghetti western with different music? Neither can I. He has a gift for capturing the exactly correct "tone" to match what he's writing for. Listen to stuff from "The Mission", and try to reconcile that with stuff from "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly", and then try to remember he also did "The Untouchables." I love Danny Elfman, but you can *always* and I do mean *always* pick out an Elfman score--Morricone is a musical chameleon, and what he writes always blends seamlessly with the images he is writing for.<br>  <br>  --Ozzy Osbourne--not exactly a great voice, but one which is absolutely perfect for his style of music. And if nothing else, he really, really knows how to emote when he sings. That's a true skill. Not bad for a bum from Birmingham.<br>  <br>  --Al Jourgensen--what more can I say? <br>  <br>  --Enya--I liked her better when she was part of Clannad, but she (and Clannad, too), were part of that whole Celtic revival era which blew everyone's minds. "Orinoco Flow" may suck, but you gotta hand it to a woman who records dozens of tracks of her own voice just so she can layer them for that full-bodied sound. Sadly, it all went downhill, and fast, when we got to the Lord of the Dance crap, and when Celine Dion did what some call singing for the soundtrack to Titanic, which was otherwise nicely Celtic in sound.<br>  <br>  --Celine Dion--cool, ain't it? Ugly as a horse, can't sing worth a damn, still can't speak English properly, and made what, like $1M a night for her sold out shows in Vegas? She should get included just because she and her fan base are living proof that there's more than one sucker born every minute, and every single one of them loves her...<br>  <br>  Bonus: Yes, I do. I am very touchy feely, so people often get a kiss, as well.<br>  <br>  P.S. One of my suggestions is total BS. Can you spot the one I despise and who I wouldn't pee on if their clothing were on fire?|`|J7oQV0zPaa	Good choice again,  I saw "Iglesias" and thought it was Enrique, I was going to slap the sense back into you lol.<br>  <br>  MA.

3MHxbRkGaa	Britain doesnt accept other races?? were not tolerant?? wtf the UK is one of the most tolerant places on earth. we have over 2 million known muslims here..... <br>  <br>  Ask yourself do you think a muslim state would tolerate 2 million western christians in the same way we accept?? No they wouldnt!!<br>  <br>  The UK IS a diverse society|`|x9WmBlu4aa	thanks to the idiotic right wing press ie the daily mail and to a lesser extent the daily comic  the sun printing O T T reports and sensationalising  every thing that concerns the muslim faith. constantly hi lighting bad points ignoring the good points. bordering on lying to get its views across .there is a lot of distrust /misunderstanding/fear of muslims.as people seem to get normal worshiping  muslims and fundamentalists/extremists  mixed up<br>   but then again these are the same type of people  who in the past have also got paediatricians and paedophiles mixed up so not alot can be said for their mentality as they are obviously more dangerous then any muslim i know|`|wmBK9uASaa	Compared to the US history on blacks and segregation the UK is more than lberal,|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Britain and US do accept diversity but as long as you have a culture that uses violence as a way to their means and you don't know who is a terrorist and who isn't,your going to get that response.I have to agree with emma h.A culture that has been violent and kill even their own people for whatever is a culture to be wary of.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	If you don't live here, you cannot possibly understand. England has become like a foreign country. It's one thing to have a limited number of immigrants in your country; it's quite another to have an endless number of people pouring in. It's even worse when those people belong to a religion and culture which is in no way compatible with the ways of that country. Life is unbearable here now.|`|jlZZbdIjaa	Some Poll/Survey....|`|5NKa5Y8laa	From what I read and see on the news (from Australia), probably because some Muslims have caused a lot of trouble in Britain? <br>  <br>  I am a (converted) Muslima.  And not proud of everything I read and see, which supposedly "represents" my religion.  We are not all like that.  I am just an average person, with a family, who works, who minds my own business, never hurts anyone else.  So I would hope that I am not put in the same basket as those so called "peace loving Muslims" in the UK.|`|CnQdSPLJaa	wow<br>  just about every answer was intolerant<br>  it's really really sad that hate and intolerance is becoming acceptable again<br>  <br>  it's like a whole new civil rights movement has to happen again, this time for muslims.  Notice all this hoopla only started after 9/11 (an attack started by foreigners) and suddenly the finger is pointed to all muslims living in the U.S, who didn't do a thing their entire lives<br>  <br>  anyways, it's probably because outside London, Britain is not as diverse as the United States (my Indian friends went and were discriminated against)|`|c46a3306019576b6a3287e4193fcde3faa	Of course we are diverse. The problem, as the USA found out, is that some of these diverse cultures have within them groups filled with a hatred of the west. They are not here because they love the country but because they really wish to destroy it and turn it into a Muslim stronghold...<br>  That democratically diverse enough for you?<br>  <br>  PS. I have many Asian friends, bless 'em.|`|4d2a746b2c406b888ee53ccce2cd95e0aa	it just isn't the UK, its the Netherlands and France, and Germany, and Italy, and Denmark, and all europe......|`|pR860mw7aa	no its because of recent attacks such the one in india and the one i think the british cricket team had in pakistan or thats atleast what i heard and because of that, pakistan is baned to have cricket matches at their home stadium.|`|PFNFTAtgaa	There's not, its a just small section people stirring tensions and exploiting the media for coverage. However seems that's American influences like to spread such conjecture.|`|3d6728f78c0ece06bd14145aac2b6269aa	The problem we have is people like "Meee" who also calls herself "Naila" with a fake avatar.

It's something I'm concerned about too.  There's small segments of the Muslim population that wants to declare the UK a Muslim country.  Isn't that crazy?????  I wouldn't have a problem with the amount of Muslims in Europe if they weren't such fanatics but it's possible that the European way of life could be in danger.  I'm not worried about this happening in the States because I know that would NEVER happen here!  It absolutely would not be allowed to happen plus the Muslim population here isn't big enough to make such an impact like that on our society.  But I'm afraid it is big enough to possibly start having an impact on European society.  Wake up Europe!  I want to live in Europe permanently but I absolutely do not want my way of life to be in danger.  <br>  As a Muslim, I do not think I would want to live somewhere that has such strong Anti-Muslim sentiment anyway.|`|Gnd5Sd5jaa	There isn't that strong an anti-Muslim sentiment, it's just that the racists and bigots are more vocal than the rest of us.<br>  It will only be Muslims for a while, then they'll move onto someone else, it was Polish before, Asians before that, Blacks before that. Unfortunately the scum of this country need to pick on someone to make themselves feel important and every minority gets its turn.|`|f5080642a85b57a445d9e4d43d1f865aaa	1: The percentage of muslims in the UK is much higher than in the US.<br>  2: The US had its share of discrimination in the past, from which it is now taking distance.<br>  <br>  Following are my observations, which everyone can make. I do not want to insult the muslim community, but the situation is not really healthy.<br>  <br>  The main problem anywhere is, that muslims do not (want to) integrate. This is not good for any culture with other traditions.<br>  <br>  Muslims discriminate forcefully on the basis of religion only. As if a belief is what a human being makes worth living, and who thinks differently is not to be included. We are all humans, aren't we?<br>  <br>  Marriages between muslims and non-muslims are absolutely impossible. Not so between most other religions, although there are exclusions and extremes too.<br>  <br>  The muslim scriptures are absolutely not friendly to those, who do not want to accept its contents: There are also parts, which declare a holy war. Other religions are more tolerant, although they also try to convert.<br>  To be honest, Christians fought holy wars too and created ages of cruelty, which hopefully belongs to the past.<br>  <br>  ...|`|9PscVlV3aa	There is more Islamphobia in the USA then here in the UK.... I mean my best mate, Anwar, He's Muslim, (born here, parents are from UAE) I have no problem, neither does any one else here....... But there are some people who fear Muslims because of the London Bombings, and more receant events (such as the Pakistan ordeal, and India) ...

You should try sites like animecrazy.net or crunchyroll.com other sites are slow, your probably watching from DivX, that video takes forever.

irSBrZiQaa	I have read on several different soap sites that Kane Manera will be leaving Guiding Light. I read that he would exit in early 2009, so I am assuming that after the cliff fall, he will be pronounced dead. Also in some other casting news Rafe will probably be going soon as well. Ashlee and Daisy were supposed to leave, but I heard they will stay, but on a part time basis. I heard that Michelle is coming back, however Danny will not be with her. Marah is also rumored to be coming back. There are a lot of Casting spoilers lately for Guiding Light, so I guess it could change, but as far as Grady goes I am pretty sure he could not have survived that fall. Oh who I am kidding it's a soap lol.....|`|28f43bc3f37fdd7c63bd4cabc06c8730aa	Maybe he's not dead, maybe he's in a coma or his body never found  so they can bring the character back at a later time.<br>  But for now bye-bye Grady.  Does that mean Cyrus is leaving, too?|`|3xOKvjzDaa	i heard hes leaving the show .. i read it in soap opera diagest|`|SpgQhRmbaa	I hope so, he's annoying as H*ll|`|m2ew9kBtaa	I so hope so, I can't stand him he is nothing but a jerk!!!!!!|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I hope Grady fell to his death today.

552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa	I agree with you regarding Tyra and Ana, it's time to end that story line anyway, it doesn't seem to be heading anywhere interesting.  <br>  <br>  You're rumors seem to be right on and leading in that direction.<br>  <br>  Curious what Victor's up too, and what happens to Kevin next, any good scoops on that..?? LOL!|`|C46DNX11aa	Yeah, I don't like Tyra either and I want Karen and Neil to stay a couple and keep Ana. Tyra can hit the road. I am sick of Sharon and she can leave with Tyra.

AA11417199	bONEHEAD. IT CAN MEAN ANYTHING, TAKE THAT ******* HAT OFF YOUR AVATAR. LOL DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONAL. I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IT MEANS.|`|kGDdqTylaa	idk|`|Es9H40Naaa	this aspect creates quite alot of friction in a relationship for better or worse.... Venus is the god of pleasure beauty,money,sensuality,and indulgence. Mars is the god of war,sexual,drives and energy and enthusiasm. When you're relationship partner's mars is opposite your venus or vice versa you'll quickly find out that you're quite different. This at times or at the begining of the relationship can be quite the turn on or seem alluring. At the same time there can be an uncomfortable feeling or frustration between you happiness and romantic needs and your partner's sexual desires... the opposition aspect is far better off than the square aspect of venus and mars. watch out for competition,arguments, and power plays.. enjoy the sexual heat and intensity and differences. Talking or communicating with your partner instead of taking things personally.

"It was so cool."<br>  <br>  Jon then proceeded to play beer pong and then follow the party with a nightcap at Memories Sports Bar & Grill, where he reportedly got drunker, flirted with the Juniata girls and told one, "We might be getting a divorce."<br>  <br>  Star Magazine had earlier reported one witness' account:<br>  <br>  "He was dirty dancing with several of them, making out, kissing them on their necks and mouths. I thought it was rather surprising for a father with his wife and so many kids at home to be acting like this. He was all over one girl, a long-haired blonde who's nearly 6 feet tall. He left with several of the girls, including her."<br>  <br>  All the rumors have prompted Jon to issue the following statement through his rep:<br>  <br>  "It is certainly hurtful for people to spread rumors and lies about us. It certainly makes me reluctant to live my life like the average person would. This has made it very clear that the simplest innocent gesture -— such as taking a picture with a fan, can be taken out of context. As you can see on the show, I am not perfect, but I am a part of a loving family and couple."

OMG I look forward to every Monday so I can see a new episode! :D|`|aLAmvX5Naa	She's not pregnant. She probably just wanted to ask her mom if she can start taking them.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	No she's not lol. Her mom just gave her the pills when she took her promise ring off.|`|lDcCn69haa	okay no i don't think so because if she was pregnant ( or even had sex) they would show it  does anyone remember  like 2 episodes ago when her mom gave her the birth con-toll pills  " she said that if you do want to us them come to me so we can talk about it , or something about that . so i think she is thinking of have sex... because grace would never go behind her mother's because season one when she was kinda dating jack and told her parents that she was hanging out with ricky. she felt so bad and told the tv Group ( Camera guy the whole story). but if she was that would make new drama and a sign that there might be a season three ( oh there is going to be a season three ... they said that on abcfamily.com ) ask this Question on that website . people will tell you what they think :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped ( the secret life forever aka tslotat) <3|`|QIGtbYpEaa	ok no way she's pregnat but idk she may have done something with Jack but I really hope not thats just innaproprite|`|Q08GpskDaa	I was thinking the exact same thing. I guess we will just have to wait until next week to find out.|`|q5qFLvnvaa	thats exactly what i was thinking i have no clue! isnt this show just so addicting?
NftoziKWaa	No, they stopped. <br>  The story of their break-up goes like this: Ted proposed to Stella, Stella said "yes," on the day of their wedding, they got into a fight because Ted invited Robin to their wedding, and so to make it even, Ted decided to go back and invite Stella's ex to their wedding. Right before the wedding, when Ted went into his room, he found a note from Stella. Stella ditched their wedding to be with her ex. That's why they aren't together anymore

E2VUH8Q0aa	Since the constellation Ophiuchus falls roughly within the Zodiac of Cancer, whatever Cancer is compatible with would also be compatible with "Ophiuchus". There are several hundred other constellations that are also not considered part of the traditional 12 Zodiac system, so it's going to be really really complicated for you to figure out compatibility of all of them if you want to go by terrestrial constellations. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

Crew members will include Michael B. Kaplan, Lev L.

bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	Dennis, is that why Jack and Jill went up the hill while old Mother Hubbard was going to the cupboard to fetch her dog a bone.  Or maybe it was the 3 blind mice who got their tales cut off with a carving knife.  I know it was the 3 little pigs who kept turning themselves around cuz that's what its all about (them being so dizzy they puked all over Miss Muffett who was sitting on her tuffett with Little Jack Horner sitting in a corner eating her curds and whey).  Then Jack said, "What a good boy am i!!!"  Actually, it would be quite sad.  In that case, I'll say a prayer tonight for the Hokey Pokeyites.|`|7c41d0650d2d056239986df304fa0bb4aa	then my name's john Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidtt. here's another: if jimmy cracks corn and nobody cares, why is there a song about him?|`|AA11905223	Thank God Hanky Panky is what it's all about, but I see your point! lol.|`|NqWl2qlPaa	Well then I wasted almost my whole life.|`|VSfiigz3aa	I wish.

Pun was actually slim, but he had an accident & broke his leg. He was in a wheelchair for a while because of it and just from inactivity and overeating, gained a lot of weight. Check out the pic in the link below.|`|AA10731562	uhh i dont know i think they were so they called themselves big|`|61DGMv52aa	Biggie Smalls was a always a chubby kid.He used to eat a lot.He was nicknamed "Big" because of his size before he turned 10-years-old.Biggie weighed as much as 300 to 380 pounds according to differing accounts from is childhood.Big Pun was not that chubby before.Big Pun struggled with his weight for most of his life; his weight fluctuated in the early 1990s between obese and morbidly obese. Big Pun enrolled in a weight-loss program in North Carolina, in which he lost 100 pounds, but he eventually quit the program before completing it, returning to New York and gaining back the weight he had lost. On February 7, 2000, Big Pun suffered a fatal heart attack and respiratory failure while temporarily staying with family at a Crowne Plaza Hotel in White Plains, New York during a home renovation. Pun was pronounced dead at the hospital after paramedics could not revive him.|`|DIxbib1paa	Cuz they loved their fried chicken!|`|1Cznz2mkaa	food is good?
a97c637ccabf727d8d80bfd5fec1fa15aa	I think that it was right for Quest Crew to win over Beat Freaks. Don't get me wrong Beat Freaks are good dancers but Quest is just better. Quest was just on the show to compete. They didn't try to use sob stories to try and get sympathy votes (like Beat Freaks did in Week 5). Also, they didn't rely on tricks for every performance. In their Hip-Hop Decathlon challenge, I don't think they used any tricks. Also Bboy is a type of dance, it's just not coreography.|`|QwwuWS1Eaa	as much as u guys hate it look at the last 2 performance they did quest blew everyone away with the hand sign things and that knee backflip and later on that headspin on the piano and that in yo face back flip push over two guys which was a amazing idea that shut everyone up lol... did u c that look on taeko face from fysh n chik WTF lol|`|0cEz1Hibaa	quest crew was better|`|NMIKtmPCaa	I definitely think the Beat Freaks should've won. The viewers were looking at the stunts which yeah they were good but breaking isn't only about tricks and stunts. The Beat Freaks were one of the cleanest crews on there and they had some amazing dance moves. They, I think, used the most creativity. Quest was good but it seems like they relied more on their stunts and less on the dance moves. And come on! The show was called America's Best DANCE Crew! Whatever, it's over now and I'm not very happy about it.|`|WwpfuzAFaa	i think that beat freaks should have won. they were really close to it too.but the viewers made the choice

I think his personality really helped him become famous also.|`|uIfbWdsvaa	his voice is different lol. but i think hes funny anyways.

1mZjbvmwaa	Blasphemy! It shouldn't have been #1|`|5grawlGUaa	i was expecting that to be number 1 just like you.  I think that anything Led Zep, Ac/Dc, Sabbath or Deep Purple because of their influence on music.  If you look at the bands influenced by those groups compared to the ones influenced by GnR the GnR bands are far inferior.|`|lk6I2TcXaa	That's nuts, I personally believe a number of the songs in the 60-80 range deserved the spot before Welcome to the Jungle.

It should be on the list, but I think "Nightrain" is WAY better than "Welcome to the Jungle"|`|oOSNI3wbaa	it doesnt bother me. its a badass song that will never be topped. it definatley deserves a place on any list of hard rock/metal songs.|`|x8mHnT2jaa	i really do think it should be number one..the song was so epic and amazing..i listened to my brother play the song thirteen times in a row and it never got old...maybe i'm just a sucker for Axl's voice...the video's nice too.. i think the song really sums up the 80's and it really sums up Los Angeles...well from what i've read.. i thought that Welcome To The Jungle sould have been number what one the top metal songs too..also i think it was Iron Man by Black Sabbath..not Paranoid..|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	I know, I hate people saying welcome to the jungle is their best song, I think Sweet child o mine and civil war are way batter, but well, its gonna be #2, #1 is gonna be back in black, I havn′t seen it but Im sure...tho welcome to the jungle isbetter...|`|Lngb8ryFaa	i guess it should be #1....most of those countdowns base the songs by which ones were a bands "breakout" song and not necessarily their best song..there are better GnR songs but that one put them on the map--and  when it came out it did freakin rock!!!  same could be said for sabbath,|`|5HvdcWvBaa	YOU'RE IN THE JUNGLE BABY, TIME TO DIIIIEE!!!!

gmVX2nZnaa	Ya if you're a scorpio deep down in moon and in Venus (love) you are most defiantly going to be a super intense peron. Extremely loyal too.<br>  <br>  I'm sorta like that too. Very loyal to all my friends. But its difficult for me to get close & open up to people, so its really hard for me to fall in love with someone. But Im pretty sure im falling for my current cancer boyfriend. Hard.<br>  <br>  Like to the point were you're so crazy about someone that you don't even notice the opposite sex now. At all. Even if they're totally flirting with you, you're completely oblivious that your friends have to point it out for you.|`|WztCveoqaa	of course there are other people like you! right well i was reading your "problem" and description i KNEW you were a scorpio before you said it haha. dont worry. i love people like you. scorpios are my best match..other than other pisces : )|`|CG7DAJAxaa	You're a scorpion and a phlegmatic.|`|xUKLUSL5aa	yes....i can get like that. i have a scorpio sun.<br>  your moon rules your emotions and venus is love and beauty so thats interesting. <br>  i always enjoy being a scorpio. <br>  i have a virgo moon, but my emotions are still intense and i still feel them completely and sometimes it can be hard and confusing. you just feel it so deep and it like controls you. but being me i keep it all in. <br>  <br>  are you asking for advice to get over a guy? or just asking if anyone else feels like this? because i feel like this at times...but if you are asking for guy advice then ill probably suck at it. <br>  <br>  ---you know what if you are asking for guy advice then go ahead and pick someone else for BA and i'll live with the thumbs down.<br>  <br>  good luck. <br>  <br>  ---oh and if you werent asking for advice and were just wondering if anyone felt like this then im sorrry for jabbering on like this.|`|DbNbWQflaa	yes ,  cancer  do not let go easily of anyone i love,|`|eT6SsCaraa	Yes, my Scorpio love and I are like that.. we are both very emotional and sensitive and kind.. and we love very truly, intensely, and passionately... <3 We've only been together six months.. but, to be honest, we've already planned out our future together already.. He's all I can see.. and I trust him more than one... We share love that will last a lifetime.. and forever... <3|`|1PdUecpYaa	i'm like that too. i'm 23 but i've only fell in love once and that person is still stuck in my head after all these years... i really loved him and i won't forget him..|`|S6m6ymNvaa	You're just scorpio all around, huh?! Cool. I do feel that way. <br>  I'm a Taurus-Sun and I'm all about loyalty.|`|WJ5lGNxxaa	I get like that too. I loved a guy for 7-8 years...

2D7jKOyFaa	I disagree completely. i am a HUGE jonas fan and i shouldn't have to hide just because other people don't want to hear about it! i mean like if they "hate" them so much then don't click on questions about them i mean its not that hard to just ignore them! i don't see how people are always like "i hate the jonas brothers" or "the jonas brothers are gay" when they spend all day answering questions saying how much they hate them but seriously they are talking about JB all day! i can talk about them all i want you don't have to if your afraid of something like people not liking you or something but im not gonna stop just because there are people who are "tired" of hearing about them!<br>  my advice for people who don't want to hear about them is:<br>  <br>  DON'T CLICK ON QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM AND DON'T SPEND ALL DAY TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU HATE THEM!<br>  <br>  it doesn't make since to me for someone who hates someone else to sit there and talk about how much the hate that person! its just not right its like they spend all their time talking about them!<br>  <br>  ok so pretty much im just saying that The people who want me to stop talking about the jonas brothers can go lay in a ditch and stay there because its  NEVER gonna happen! my whole life i will talk about them<br>  anything you say can no WILL make me say something about them so just back off! <br>   <br>  Thanks ?<br>  Kaytee|`|9tonO25oaa	I just dont get it! Why do people hate the Jonas Brothers? I mean there songs are awsome, i love the lyrics, they are Christian, they are down to earth, and they are SO COOL! I mean what more do you want??? I totally agree with you, we should cut down the questions about them or we will have more and more haters, and again i agree i am also tired of people saying " They are gay" or " There music sucks " or " I hate the Jonas Brothers ". And i did star this question cause i do think you have a point.<br>  And i agree with AWNUT, a Truce is a great idea!|`|AA11615501	I like Amy Winehouse so you can only imagine what kind of Haters I get.

I get your point. And I agree. Too much Jonas love.|`|v1tHjJ3haa	Your right, I'll only ask 2 or 3 times a month :D  I call truce<br>   It doesn't mean that haters win, It just means we are cutting them slack, I'm gonna miss all the JB questions ! :(
a1Ngi39Xaa	I found the following information on Wiki.<br>  <br>  Jonathan Talks about wanting an old school vibe again and lyrics.<br>  <br>  Korn frontman Jonathan Davis revealed to The Pulse of Radio this week that guitarist James "Munky" Shaffer, bassist Reginald "Fieldy" Arvizu and drummer Ray Luzier are in the studio writing music for the next KORN album. The band's ninth effort will be produced by Ross Robinson, who also worked on their first two albums. Davis told The Pulse of Radio that the group intends to get back to the sound of those early CDs.<br>  <br>  "It's gonna be very raw, it's gonna be old school like the first Korn records," he said. "Basically, it's gonna be recorded as a four-piece band, with just Munky on guitars and Fieldy and Ray and me. We really want to go back to that old-school vibe. It was just really intense and emotional and, you know, I have a lot of built-up aggression toward certain things that I need to get out for this record."<br>  <br>  Davis said that many of the lyrics on the upcoming album will deal with the topic of organized religion.<br>  <br>  Korn will play Ohio's Rock On The Range festival in May and several European festivals this summer before recording the new album later this year.<br>  <br>  The band will also be looking for a home for the yet-to-be-titled disc since completing its two-album deal with Virgin Records in 2007.<br>  <br>  Korn is the back up band players in Lil Wayne's video for his new rock song "Prom Queen" which premiered March 3rd. Munky is playing guitar, Fieldy is playing bass, and Jonathan is playing drums.|`|ebxwADDcaa	wow are they just trying to bash the guy that left their band?|`|dqCTS60raa	True red robison is going to record it, they are going to start touring at the middle of 09 ib festivals such as the Download festival and Rock Am.|`|FBvFz9DBaa	Well, how are we supposed to know if it is not yet known???

7c78402fd1142e6ed4496774eb33431baa	This is kinda interesting! I was talking to a friend online a few weeks back, and it was on the topic of angels and demons in religions. Her favourite one was Lilith - a demon who roams at night via the wind and brings disease and illness. She also killed children. It's often associated with erotic dreams. <br>  <br>  So, I would guess that it's a bad omen/lock-up-your-kids thing in the olden days, but now it could mean a bad period of ill-health or temptation.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	I also have a Gemini in Lilith and I'd love to know the answer. :D

D0odCkGhaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  I'm glad to see that you're pouring yourself into music from a very young age!  I teach students as young as 6 years old to play the piano by ear.<br>  <br>  Playing the piano by ear is different from playing by notes.  While I do not discourage someone from learning to play the piano by note, it is not required.  After 20 years of teaching hundreds of students to play the piano by ear, I have seen great success.<br>  <br>  You do not have to be gifted to learn to play the piano by ear.  Playing the piano by ear involves three things:<br>  <br>  Really, I know it's hard to believe, but it's simple to play by ear:<br>  <br>  1. Learn scales and chords (this is kind of the boring part but it's essential)<br>  2. Learn how to pick out the melody to a song with your right hand. (You use the scale to help you with this.)<br>  3. Learn to play the chords with the left hand (as rhythm and accompaniment to the melody).<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful.  You can get more information about playing the piano by ear from the website listed below.<br>  <br>  Matthew Stephens|`|oSXgtqYCaa	Hi! Good for you for taking lessons for so long. Why did you stop? What kind of music do you wish to play? <br>  <br>  If it is jazz, rock, pop, etc., it is possible to learn to play by ear. Many do, but most are very limited because they didn't learn more than a basic understanding of notes, theory, scales, etc. I think people who do this learn by repeating what they hear, and by learning basic chords. It comes more easily for some than others. But even jazz artists go to music schools for training.<br>  <br>  And, if it is classical music, it is possible to learn with Suzuki, which starts with playing by ear. But Suzuki also switches to learning notes at some point.<br>  <br>  My point is, to be the best musician of any type of music, learn your notes, take lessons, practice scales, arpeggios, etudes and solos! It will make you a more complete musician, even if you switch to or learn another genre along the way.<br>  <br>  And.....it's more fun!

PiFepOQZaa	step1<br>  You don’t actually need talent to become a rock star, but you do need the proper equipment. It’s best to be wise and take your time when deciding on which instrument to buy. Don’t just run to your nearest music megastore and purchase the first shiny guitar that catches your eye. You want people to think that you actually play the instrument, so pawn shops and other used-goods stores are the best places to find instruments that already have that used look. A few scratch marks, sticker decals and a case that is falling apart will give your instrument a look that says “My owner must be good since I have been used so much!”<br>  step 2<br>  When rock stars walk into the room, heads automatically turn to them. Some people were just born with that special presence. For those of us who weren’t, proper style can give you the look and confidence to command attention in any situation. <br>  step 3<br>  Obtaining groupies is the most difficult part of becoming a rock star. It may take a little while for people to recognize your greatness, but once they do it will be worth the wait.<br>  step 4<br>  Rock stars are famous for their ability to party. In order to be a rock star you have to live up to this hard-livin’ reputation.<br>  <br>  (WARNING: PARTYING LIKE A ROCK STAR MIGHT BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH)<br>  step 5<br>  If you simply follow steps one through four and you should be prepared to enjoy the life and luxuries of a rock star!|`|wOc4Dqllaa	Get an electric guitar, then take some time and learn how to play.|`|vAwzvNgzaa	You're asking the wrong crowd.|`|AdBSJYiLaa	first of all<br>  moneey<br>  then you can pay to the radiostation and they can hear u<br>  and if someone like's it can call you<br>  or i think i need to ask Pink<br>  'i'm still a rockstar i got my rock moves(8) '|`|WHcBV7rLaa	Have talent [hopefully], extremely good luck, and publicity.|`|kwB9e37vaa	"what do you to be a rock star?"<br>  WTF?!?!|`|87deabd3c525e7aca518d4cbf44e4df0aa	I think you're missing a verb somewhere in that question.|`|AYO5Ys32aa	I throw away my trash separated (ex.

Try Zamzar conversion. It's free to use. Just go to the site and bookmark the site zamzar.com onto the bookmarks on your browser tabs. Then go to the video you wish to rip off on youtube. Then let the whole video load, after that go to your book mark and you will see a space for a url. The url should already have the site which you are ripping off. Enter the email which you want to get the file to be sent to. They also let you choose what format you want the video in. Choose whatever type of conversion you need. But I have never used the video format only music for me. After you send, it should show a loading page, sending the file. Once it's done, it will arrive to your email within 12 hours.

d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	It was good, just not great.  I consider it a 7.5 out of 10.<br>  <br>  Some things could have been better, some things were obviosuly changed in order fit into the screen time.  <br>  <br>  I liked the effects, costumes and period music.  The casting was ok, the acting was a mixed bag.  A couple of very strong performances offset by a couple of weak ones.  It's not a bad movie but not up to par with recent films like Lord of the Rings, Iron Man and the Dark Knight  where everyone was perfect in their roles.<br>  <br>  There's a director cut coming in June which adds 25 minutes- the inclusion of those missing scenes may help, especially towards the end.|`|y8WBcehmaa	*spoilers*<br>  <br>  too much blue balls.|`|0KoH6c0raa	I would say its just good not really really good but it does get there,and be one of the better sicence fiction offerings of late.|`|qXiD91x6aa	They did it okay.

Jj1Nn7j0aa	Because sound is waves in the air, like waves on the water. Low tones oscillate (go up, then down) at around 60 times a second. High tones oscillate at around 10,000 times a second.<br>  <br>  When you fast forward, it reads all the data off faster, so the low tone will be playing at say double speed (120 oscillations per second), and the high tone will be oscillating at 20,000 times per second.|`|MxZLuToAaa	Not that sure, but when you talk fast, the air comes out faster from your mouth making your voice higher, so that all your words can fit in. Not sure why it would happen on the TV or Computer though...|`|R8iz9ZM1aa	i dont know...<br>  <br>  but why would i??<br>  <br>  hahha|`|e7wD8sUiaa	I never really thought about it, but my guess is it has something to do with frequency. It is sort of like a guitar string. The further up the neck you place your finger the higher the pitch. The shorter the segment of string that is vibrating is, the higher the pitch. It vibrates at a higher frequency. So when you speed up the recording you are increasing the frequency, thereby raising the pitch.|`|8Si4dfUnaa	because what makes a noise "higher" or "lower" is it's frequency or the number of wavelengths per second so when you "speed" a noise up your just increasing the frequency just like when you slow it down the voice gets low and deep

9RTuRPviaa	Yeah, it seems like Money would fit better on Wish You Were Here, like between Welcome To The Machine and Have A Cigar.<br>  <br>  But are you listening to DSOTM on cd or LP? Because it Does disrupt the flow on a cd. But on vinyl, Money was the first track of side 2, so it flows a bit better when you think of it in that respect.|`|LwqM7EHVaa	I don't agree with you, because Dark side of the moon was about LIFE, and money is part of our lives, "it's the root of all evil today".|`|VKKyVlznaa	I think tha "Money" was the selling de factor on tha album, look at the facts, every band back then had a "sellin song" to sell to the public, catchy in other words of the wise wizard. Look, Money was like a detour in tha album, you just going into this land, then WHAM you enter a spce portal, this being "Money" and where are ya at?

Im glad Jason left her.....see how many doors opened for her? Melissa is probably the most loved person in America right now...haha|`|5LxpvXSmaa	Bravo for Melissa! She glided across that floor tonight and what a week she had! i thought ABC had done her an injustice having to broadcast what happened to her last week but i think that the injustice has been corrected. Jason's loss is our gain. To go from the lowest of lows to the highest high it could not have been more perfect for her! Congratulations Melissa!|`|5070437d89b5a5c0baa621683e5f89f9aa	I knew she'd do great!  Ballet background - which of course helped her become a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader!<br>  <br>  SHe's adorable - and very humble ("23 points better than I thought I'd get" Melissa said.)<br>  <br>  Yep, eat your heart out Jason- He and Molly and Ty are watching her on the telly - and now he's thinking "what did I do???  " haha.<br>  <br>  Go Melissa!|`|W7eEsMjuaa	I think Melissa did incredibly well for only two days training and the kind of week she’s been having. I think America DOES feel sorry for her the way Jason treated her, but if she doesn't do well,. they wont continue to vote for her to the end.<br>  I'm sure her Dallas Cowboy Cheer leading training helped her pick up routines quickly. They do have very high standards. She also had ballet training which always is a plus. <br>  <br>  I am rooting for her. What a great "revenge" on how Jason treated her than to have americas sympthay and support. <br>  <br>  Holly from "gossip Girls" the other last minute replacement, may be pretty, and maybe she didn't have a lot of practice time for the show, But, she was stiff and wooden. It seems often these really pretty girls,. (Like Kim Kardashian) have what it takes in the looks department but don't know how to use their bodies in a dancing routine. I look for her to be one of the first voted off the show. <br>  <br>  I hate to say it but Holly seems like a typical "bimbo" to me as well.<br>  <br>  Its early yet,. But I felt sorry a bit for Ty,. he was so stiff,. and awkward,, <br>  Steve O did ok. but don't like his personality,. <br>  Steve from Apple? well he knows he's not that great,. but he has a bizillion dollars so he’s just in it for fun. <br>  Lil’ Kim.. maybe,. has potential. <br>  Belinda Carlise? so-so, she doesn't have the energy you need to win,. and probably not the fan base.<br>  Lawrence? athletes can go either way. sometimes though they start off badly and get better with time.<br>  Gilles?.. we will see,. Cheryl is a good teacher. he might do ok.<br>  David Grier? did alright.. not bad. could improve<br>  I hated Denise Richards. that crying scene this early in the show, says she cant take the pressure. and I don’t think fans are that crazy about her either. her crybaby act turned me off right then and there. Maks is tough.. but he's good. <br>  Shawn is also a cutie,. And I think her training as a gymnast will help her go far|`|TfijWwsYaa	yay...so glad she is on the show.  I hope she wins and does start dating someone in Hollywood.  Eat your heart out Jason.|`|coVZ1uqCaa	Yeah. She was amazing on the dance floor.<br>  "She will end up dating somebody in Hollywood now."<br>  I actually heard that she was dating her friend.<br>  <br>  Jason dumping her changed Melissa's life.<br>  Everyone loves her now, and that's Jason's loss.<br>  What a world of opportunities Melissa has.<br>  <br>  -----|`|wcQW38Xgaa	yup, it''s true. Melissa is doing a great job at DWTS so far and it seems like she'll be doing a whole lot better than if she would have ended up with Jason. because "when one door closes another one opens." I loved how she stated, "Oh, please I'm doing fine." It came so naturally & I'm glad she does paying attention to that nonsense, people need to stop labeling her as the "dumpee or Jason Mesnick choice #1, or whatever else" .. Melissa should be referred to for who she is not what show she came from. But great choice for this season. She's got a long way to go !|`|TYsw7TzIaa	Coming from a dancer of 12 years, she was WONDERFUL. Not only is she a sweet person, but she's elegant, graceful, her extensions were there, and she learned it all in just two days!<br>  I'm so glad she got on the show; I'd give anything to see Jason's face. Especially when the audience boo-ed him. :D <br>  I think Bruno said it best. He's a complete loser. Haha.|`|uwds1QuVaa	I love her!  She is America's Sweetheart and she was fantastic!   I am so happy for her.  She deserves so much better than that loser bachelor, and she's going places!  She did a fabulous job tonight.|`|qLWexlkdaa	i love her! and i loved her dance!<br>  she does have a boyfriend currently though.<br>  ever so convienantly his name is ty haha.<br>  but i think she's going to go far in the competition for sure! :D|`|4cSHX4QPaa	I'm soo happy for her!

TK8j6Ic4aa	"Emo" is a label used to describe kids who generally listen to a genre of music called "Emotive hardcore". It's where the name originated from.<br>  A stereotypical emo kid is someone who wears Tripp pants [the ones with the chains all over them], writes deep and meaningful poetry, listens to hardcore screamo, is depressed all the time, cuts, is suicidal, shops at Hot Topic, cries a lot, is agnostic OR a Satanist, finds themselves to be deep and insecure, and hides themselves from the world outside their smallish group of emo friends.<br>  <br>  Basically it's a more emotional goth, but most kids who are labelled emo are insulted by it. So don't call anyone emo unless they give you permission to, and the ones that give you permission to are posers and they just want attention.<br>  <br>  They're also insulted by people checking their wrists for scars. That's a hint to the people who assume that people who shop at Hot Topic are automatically cutters.<br>  Maybe we happen to like the color black.<br>  Perhaps most of the bands we listen to make black shirts.<br>  That doesn't necessarily mean that we hate the world and take it out on our arms.<br>  ALSOOO... the ones that do need help.<br>  And lumping them all together under the heading "emo" is why so many of them aren't getting the help they need.|`|SH2ysn6faa	im gonna sing you the emo boy song ima emo boy i take away your jooooy im such a let down i turn your smile into a frown . all my family is dead i cut my wrist til they bleed red all the boys hate me the girls just wanna date me ima joke and a twit but that doesnt mean sh*t cuz im hott and youre not can you dig it you bastard you ran off to oro you dumb goth something blah we both know where he likes to stick it *butt secks* and at night i cry cuz all my fan girls think im gaaay oooooohhhh....heheh emotional people who say they cut them selves and listen to all thay screamin music  and hate their lives and so on|`|6LdCn0YPaa	emo is short for emotional. an emo person is a person who hates his/her life. by hate I mean very close to suicide but not close enough. emo people usually cut themselves but don't have to. emoness is considered a psychological disorder and a life style choice. emo people usually wear black, dark purple, and colors that match with black (but they always wear something black).|`|VtTBRrl1aa	emo is short for emotional.<br>  its just a stupid label.<br>  when it started it was just a kind of music but people stretched it out into this big stupid fest!<br>  now people say its people who cut themselves wear black mostly and listen to deppressing music.<br>  its all going to blow over soon enough.<br>  but for now all the people that decide they can take one look at someone and tell them exactly who they are, well they can go to hell.|`|zNY0njz2aa	DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE IDIOTIC PEOPLE<br>  well..most of them..<br>  emo is NOT just a cutter.<br>  emo is short for emotional.<br>  emo is a type of music. a genre. <br>  emo is a clothing style. like dark clothes. and heavy makeup<br>  yes, there are "emos" who cut themselves. hey, don't judge them. they mightt have problems. okay? they could have issues and need to get out feeling. also, they could have mental issues. so back off them. >=[|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	Seriously???

They think that being absorbed in 'dark' things, it gives them depth of character, however they are just following a trend. Where i come from, calling someone emo is an insult, and emos won't admit their emo. To them they are 'goth' or 'punk'. which is stupid cuz they are emo.<br>  <br>  basically, emo is a stupid trend that begs for attention.<br>  emo's aren't cool.|`|9eMJsBoZaa	Emo stands for 'emotional', and is closely assosciated with goths. <br>  <br>  The generalization for emo is someone who wears tight, black clothing, and often chains.

Often write about their feelings or with a theme of 'everything sucks' and despair in either a journal or an online journal such as facebook or myspace. <br>  Something closely associated with emos is the slitting of wrists.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|tUx5vdqwaa	its a stereotype. this stereotype is supposed to be people who dress in black and have different colored hair and some cut their selves, they are supposed to be very emotional.<br>  emo definition:<a href="http://www.emo-corner.com/what-is-emo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emo-corner.com/what-is-emo/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14605938@N03/1492605624/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/14605938@N0...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9006736@N02/1839496699/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/9006736@N02...</a>|`|iSq3mh3waa	Emo is a state of mind.

3a01c0ab887b9ad9d7b78f85618d8bf5aa	1. Use your cell phone to call your home phone or have someone call your home phone who you've clued into the prank. Tell them to stay silent after you've called your family member to the phone, telling them the call is for them. You run to an extension phone if you're not using your cell & when your family member answers, you say hello but nothing more. When they say hello again, you do the same. If they ask who it is, you say, "you should know, you called ME" then just play it by ear, egging it on till they get frustrated then shout April Fool. But sometimes they slam the reciever down before you can.<br>  <br>  2. Use your cell phone to call your home phone or have someone call your home phone who you've clued into the prank. Tell them to stay silent after you've called your dad to the phone, telling them the call is for them. You run to an extension phone if you're not using your cell & when your family member answers, you say "This is People Finder Incorporated, is this Mr (your dads name) & when he says yes, you say "we're contacting you on behalf of a client who believes you are his biological father"  Then egg it on, using an age of a fictional child who is a couple years older than the oldest child your dad actually has.<br>  <br>  3. Use your cell phone to call your home phone or have someone call your home phone who you've clued into the prank. Tell them to stay silent after you've called your brother to the phone, telling them the call is for them. You run to an extension phone if you're not using your cell & when your family member answers, you say  "This is the Family Planning Center, are you (your brothers full name) & when he says yes, you tell him "We're calling on behalf of our client who has named you as the father of her expected child" then egg it on according to his remarks.<br>  <br>  4. Sneak outside & knock on the door or ring the door bell then run to another door & do the same thing then run back to the first door & when they open it, say "thanks, I thought no one would ever let me in, April fool!"<br>  <br>  5. Knock on the door from the inside, yell "I'll get it" then open the door & yell for you dad or brother, saying someones at the door for them.  Walk away but where you can watch them look around for 'nobody there' & when they say no ones there, egg it on like someone was, describing a person, then tell them April fool.<br>  <br>  6. Write April Fool on a note, wrap it in a box, either gift wrap or shipping paper with used stamps glued on it, cut from old envelopes. Address the box to your family member or put a tag on the 'gift' with their name on it.  Watch their face when they open it & find the note but pretend you don't know anything about it.  You can leave the gift where they will find it or you can knock on the door, yell I've got it, then tell them the shipping box was dropped off to them.  You can also put the April Fool note in an envelope with old stamps glued to it + family members name & address & leave it with the rest of the mail.<br>  <br>  7. Get to the daily news paper before anyone else, put a small smear of glue at the corners of each page so they all stick together, rolling the paper back up the way it comes from the carrier.  Inside the paper you can write April Fool someplace.<br>  <br>  8. Lightly color some white glue with a tint of green food coloring, put a glob on a kleenex with a raisin in the middle then wad the kleenex up around the glob & leave the kleenex someplace that would disgust your family member.<br>  <br>  9. Without being noticed, peel the paper off of one of your moms mini pads, walk up to your family member & pat him on the back, leaving the mini pad stuck to his shirt.  Make it gross by putting a drop of red food color in the middle first.<br>  <br>  10. While your brother is still sleeping in the morning, go outside & tape large black garbage bags on his windows to keep his room dark when the sun comes up.  If possible, sneak into his room & change his clock so he'll be totally confused as to what time of day it is!|`|TRnp3H3daa	My favorite April Fool's gift is Evil Fortune Cookies from:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.EvilFortuneCookies.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.EvilFortuneCookies.com</a>|`|6CSBvVxtaa	oh kay so the hose that is on your sink that turns on when you push down the trigger and turn the water on ya that thing...<br>  well if the hose is black for example put a black rubber band on it so that the trigger is being pushed down then when someone turns on the water they will be sprayed by the hose<br>  =]]|`|7c41d0650d2d056239986df304fa0bb4aa	switch the sugar with the salt. cut off the water to the sink. put a balloon behind your dad's back tire on the side he won't see. hide in the trash can and pop out when they get near.turn off the water heater so they get cold showers. disconnect the TVs. have a random person call them in the middle of the day and have them say creepy stuff. quote something from The Shining or other scary movies|`|8OBjQ5R6aa	A series of small pranks will do wonders.<br>  <br>  First-the shower. Simply, turn the show head so when someone turns the shower on it will spray water on the person with their clothes on.<br>  <br>  Next-Breakfast. Replace all the bags in the cereal box with vegetables. Mwah ha ha ha!<br>  <br>  And it goes on|`|RbCsBbhLaa	Well if you want ones that aren't cruel. <br>  <br>  you could save a news paper from a few days previous and sneak outside and change them that morning. <br>  <br>  if someone in your family has their alarm set to wake them up every day at the same time you could set it back an hour so it wakes them up earlier. <br>  <br>  Super glue a quarter to the sidewalk outside. <br>  <br>  for your step dad. <br>  <br>  if he drinks coffee in the morning and uses creamer that is flavored or something like that. You could pour the creamer out of the bottle and into something else and then put milk into it. <br>  <br>  you could take someones cell and change the ring tone. <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|WkC1c78kaa	Okay, this one is hilarious! You know those snapper things that if  you throw them on the ground they make a really loud sound? Well, get a couple of those and put them under the toilet seat, under the lid at one of the parts that press down when someone sits on them. When they're not home, you should do a few tests, and make sure you put them in the right places. If you do it right, the next time someone sits down to use the bathroom, there will be some loud popping sound that will scare the crap out of them!

4276QxQLaa	Yes!!!<br>  <br>  When you want to lounge on a soft chair, instead of the grass/grounds...you can do it.<br>  <br>  When you want to go the bathroom, you don't have to wait in long lines and even if you did, they're a bit cleaner AND they have toilet paper<br>  <br>  Not to mention the amenities....alcohol....right there for you, instead of walking and standing in long lines again<br>  <br>  But if you plan on rocking and rolling so hard that you're on the floors, smiling and feeling the music, most of the time....then, maybe you are wasting your money.
AF33MUSfaa	which kyle xy episode u talkin g bout mate?|`|SASlIftVaa	no i dont its boring|`|pZqLC8P1aa	in tonight's episode, he said that he did not mean to kill Sara. She attacked him, and he acted in self defense. He also said that Sara was mad at him because she knew he was from Latnok, and did not approve of their latest experiments (where they are trying to create more people like Kyle and Jesse in those pods). THis did take some prodding though to get out of him. <br>  <br>  Also, earlier at the dinner table he commented about how in the first episode in which Jesse was out of the pod, she killed a man. I dont think thats what you wanted to know though|`|AA12096290	Yes I do watch it, it's one of my favourites:<br>  <a href="http://thetvuniverse.blogspot.com/search/label/Kyle%20XY" rel="nofollow">http://thetvuniverse.blogspot.com/search...</a>|`|Keq8vYJLaa	Yes, I do watch it. I love a lot of Drama shows. But which episode are you talking about?|`|ZUNmcAmmaa	Nahh.
hDwSbe79aa	If you have not been watching the show since day one, this is why you are confused.<br>  <br>  Question 1:<br>  When jessie escaped from Latnock, she was naked and running through the woods scared our of her mind. When she walked by a campsite some perv wanted to do her and he tried to rape her. He had a knife. She managed to get the knife and kill him. Very few characters know about this incident.<br>  <br>  2. That guy was Foss. Remember back when Adam Baylin was alive? That is the guy who was helping Kyle with his training. Foss is a very important character. He knows all of the secrets about Kyle and Jessie and everyone.<br>  <br>  3. They tricked Cassidy because they wanted him to think Jessie was dead, and they wanted him and Kyle to be close so Kyle could get more dirt on him. Kyle is still convinced that he killed Sarah (Jessies mom) but that has not been confirmed. Kyle and Jessie and Foss hatched a plan to through Cassidy off so they could do some more investigation. Jessie can do even more investigation because Cassidy thinks she is dead.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.<br>  I also hate to break it to you, but Kyle XY has been cancelled. Next Monday is the last episode ever.|`|FY7YpDItaa	Cassidy called Jessie a murderer cause she killed a camper when she escaped from the pod.<br>  <br>  The "guy" was Adam Bailyn's friend...i think...the guy who helped Kyle<br>  <br>  They tricked Cassidy cause Cassidy doesn't like Jessie and is killed her mother.|`|GHeqcovHaa	1) Because when she first came out of her pod, she murdered a camper. But, she hadn't mastered her strength and he was trying to rape her.<br>  2) Tom Foss (Kyle's old trainer)<br>  3) Because he killed Jessi's mother and they are trying to get information out of him.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped! =]

I'm going to change my response this time: it's usually Tchaikovsky's "Piano Concerto #-1.<br>  <br>       Today, it's:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxzpy1b1_BY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxzpy1b1_...</a><br>  <br>                                                   Alberich|`|jR8kyp0Taa	The slow variation from Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini".<br>  <br>  I can't think of anything even remotely close to the beauty of that particular variation, save for some OTHER Rachmaninoff stuff, namely parts of his concertos.<br>  <br>  Boy Wonder|`|oSXgtqYCaa	I LOVE that ballade. Also listen to Brahms Intermezzi.

UVq3KLjqaa	Just go, but when you get there tell your coach or whoever is in charge of you from then on that you're not feeling well. Try to cry if you can because then he/she will feel bad for you and probably bench you the whole time. If they ask if you're feeling better, just say no. Try to make it believeable, like you have a massive headache or your stomach hurts or something like that. I just hope your parents aren't coming to watch because if they know you don't want to play and you were feeling fine before you left... they will know you lied will probably be mad. Just tell them that you really don't feel good before you leave, but say you'll try to play anyway. Then that will seem like you're taking responsibility for something you don't want to do. :D Hope it works.|`|FqsQzJNTaa	I know how ya feel. My school does that too.

On your way to school, wrap your wrist. When you get to school you tell them you can't play in the game beacuse you fell and sprained your wrist. Doctor told you to wrap it and rest it for a few days. Might not get you out of attending the game, but WiLL get you out of playing.<br>  <br>  You can also help fake sick, by breaking open a Vicks Nasal Inhaler and rub it underneath your eyes. Be careful not to get in your eyes. Your eyes will turn red and water like crazy. Makes you look like you have a cold or flu. A fake cough even adds a bit more to the drama.

In my opinion, hes wrong.|`|C9zBZWlEaa	not if she put her self in that position, you can only push a man so far til they snap... but no one deserves that kind of beating.. obvious she started it if she took him back....|`|H3PdZiojaa	Yes he had no right to put his hands on rihanna and he use the fact that his step-dad hit his mother as an excuse|`|oJr0Suzwaa	Yes.

OMG, next guy we bought from almost paid us to take stuff away.<br>  <br>  from then on she get hugh amounts off everything. even places your not supposed to like really posh shops, buses, cinema, already on sale items....seriously anything and everything. The dj at our wedding was first class...$150....the award winning wedding specialist photographer and over 300 photos....$2600 ....money off a new season  handbag chanel!!!....she even bargained so hard with a used car salesman she ripped him off. he had to call me back up the next day and try to get even 50 or 100 bucks back (i was embarrased)....i could go on forever.<br>  <br>  i think one trick she keeps sharp with is even trying to get money off if its small. like the bus. she took the bus a while ago and still got money off. she does it for almost everything and is now a serious expert at it.<br>  <br>  also, know your prices...its not a bargain if you dont know what its worth. be a keen shopper and know where to buy things.<br>  <br>  keep trying and keep it funny/light but only on the surface, underneath you have a predatory like determination to achiee one goal, as much money off or free stuff as you can get.....THE BEST DEAL.<br>  <br>  EDIT....<br>  <br>  try sharpen your technique ESPECIALLY in places where your are not supposed to. try small like the local shop. try look for a reason....let them know you dont know what choch bar to get....will they do a deal for 3? after you hit a "NO" a few times you will start to get annoyed about it and try to find better ways of getting a "YES"|`|bH6KUo3jaa	coupons|`|9EFzGlwwaa	if u want a ipod touch go to this website.

Like the Pure-Bloods staying Pure-Bloods.<br>  I agree with some of the other answers as welll. <br>  There has been proof that they are sister and brother and they are to be married to save their race.<br>  If you are American, then of course this seems "screwed up".<br>  ^_~|`|jsgtX7qhaa	I don't know why but I actually rooted for this couple. I think they're cute together, but I also think Yuuki and Zero would be cute too. I don't think its wrong. Kaname isn't Yuuki's real brother he is actually one of the ancient vampires that was awoken by Rido and thats why he can't just kill him.|`|6G0QEp1saa	Yes, when I found out that Kaname told the truth to Yuki. I was like what? No its just like Angel Sanctuary. Why do people like the Japanese screw this up. What's up with the incest thing? Maybe there are vampires. Thats why. But just because there are vampires, doesn't mean they should get married. Who knows? Well I think it is screwed up anyway so yeah. It is screwed.|`|ZvOMRSdSaa	I haven't read it recently, but I'm pretty sure she isn't his blood brother, she was just with them for a long time at a young age.

The other four co-writers of the song are - you guessed it - the other four members of Dead or Alive.<br>  <br>  And this is the original promo video that came out with the song:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUatnbaNfEo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUatnbaNf...</a>|`|bVbFAyzjaa	it's dead or alive|`|PUO2y0c2aa	You are right.

XxZnxPSOaa	The pic link is below. Yu is making a massage on Shin.<br>  <br>  About gay talk I already replied someone here regarding this subject.<br>  <br>  they are too young and seems undecided. But anyway I read an interview with them on cinemabizarre-fans page. They answered the following question (around 1 year ago):<br>  Boys or Girls?<br>  Strify - " hermaphrodite"<br>  Kiro- ";)"<br>  Yu- "Girls"<br>  Shin- "Fun Question?"<br>  <br>  Later, on last september Strify assumed he is gay on stage. Kiro almost did the same. Searched on Youtube and found it for you.<br>  Yu say he likes girls but kissed Kiro in some concerts. Shin is a discreet guy, but there are some shots on web from years ago where he was in intimist time with some guys opening his trousers.

JgCGpQaxaa	Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei hands down.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, there isn't any other anime parody that comes even close.<br>  <br>  It had soo many parodies from all over the place.   They had DBZ refrences (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq86xOx7VhA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq86xOx7V...</a> ) to Magical Girl references (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-n0ppnW7c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-n0ppnW...</a> ) Heck the very characters themselves where stereotypes. Such as the hikikomori girl aptly named Kiri Komori.<br>  <br>  I love this show.|`|4qVWj3UHaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2avdf289OY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2avdf289...</a>|`|xFrIGJEsaa	I'd have to go with Excel Saga. <br>  <br>  Every single episode parodies a different kind of Anime.
JgCGpQaxaa	Oh gosh this is going to be all over the place.<br>  <br>  How about Kittan Bachika from Gurren Lagann as a choice though.  He is not the best characer ever.  Heck he's not even the best character in the series.  But there are SOOOO many good characters (Kamina, Simon, Viral, Lord Genome, Yoko, etc) in this series that even though he is awesome, he can't help but be over shadowed.|`|HYimN0Akaa	I'd have to go with either Shippo from Inuyasha or Kyou from Fruits Basket|`|AA11025703	Pinako Rockbell from Fullmetal Alchemist
JgCGpQaxaa	aweeee  I adore Skuld.<br>  <br>  But no Misa from Death Note for your list?  Oh gawd... I'm hearing her voice again...|`|c6oobrlAaa	Hiro from Furuba<br>  Asami from KouKou Debut, idk she just annoys me.
cLW7vFUGaa	Okay, so she's probably too minor to even call a supporting character, but I took a liking to Maya Ibuki from Neon Genesis Evangelion. Everyone else had such issues and was either constantly freaking out or not freaked out enough at serious situations - but, faithfully right there in the front of the control room every time, I felt like Maya always had the right personality and reactions to things.<br>  <br>  Also, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya seems to make some of its greatest popularity off the supporting cast. There's Taniguchi with his "wa-wa-wa-wasuremono," and Tsuruya-san with her lovable LOLfang and catchphrases like "nyoro~n!"|`|YHu0TUxdaa	Rei Ayanami was the best hands down. Without her character thru out NGE the anime would be pointless. Is was only cause of her we also got the ending the amazing anime deserved. She was also vital to the development of Shinji's character. Asuka and Gendo are a close second, but Rei wins every time|`|HqyFyF8haa	Definitely C.C. from Code Geass.<br>  She is an amazing character who supported Lelouch throughout practically the whole show.<br>  Not only that, C.C. added a very good sense of humor to the show.|`|d7j9Wbbhaa	C.C. - Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. She doesn't reveal much about herself, and she taunts most of the other characters, yet agrees to help them.|`|GVcO1dtnaa	Tamao from Strawberry Panic!|`|8yE2sYGeaa	She is good, but I have to give it to Shikijo from Mahoromatic, as she is willing to go head to head (or, in their case, boob to boob) to "prove' a superiority over Mahoro Ando
cLW7vFUGaa	Yeah, I'd say despite her physical tininess, Chiyo-chan is pretty mentally mature. You can't expect much more out of a girl her age. Of course, we can always count on her refreshing innocence during times like Yukari's drunken lecture!<br>  <br>  The main character Hinata from the CLAMP manga "Suki: A Like Story" definitely comes to mind, but since we're talking about anime...<br>  <br>  I think every slice-of-life type show has at least one stereotypically na?ve girl. Tsukasa Hiiragi from Lucky Star fits the bill pretty well! Oh, and we can't forget sweet little Yutaka and her "Yaoi tte nani?"<br>  <br>  I also want to say Matsuri from Ichigo Mashimaro / Strawberry Marshmallow.<br>  <br>  And the mini-girls from Bottle Fairy, as well as their neighbor Tama-chan, are the epitome of literal na?veté, spending their entire thriteen episodes of screentime unsuccessfully trying to figure out how the real world works.|`|HINny8cGaa	i'd say the main girl in Ikki Tousen.  She seems pretty out of it....

33l1SqrRaa	It's just a song about wanting a girl who is so deep, that the distress it causes him to lose himself.|`|uOihCBDHaa	The lyrics to this song are actually quite clever. This song is about obsession - that constant want or desire that keeps weighing so "heavily" on one's thoughts. Who he wrote the song about is hardly even the point, although it is nice to know what was going through his head.<br>  The simplicity of the lyrics really drive the message home. The song isn't reflective on the obsession, nor does it really bother with symbolism or rhyme. The lyrics are repetitive and thoughtless, just like any obsession. Obsessions are blinding, they force us to see the surface and prevent us from seeing the big picture, thus the lack of symbolism and thought to the lyrics. The words are as repetitive as the obsession that runs through his head. The thoughtlessness and simplicity to the lyrics of this song is exactly the point of the song. So before anybody thinks any less of the beatles for writing "brainless, thoughtless" lyrics, think about how brainless and thoughtless humans can truly be when blinded by an obsession. Whether or not the obsession is good or bad, its all blinding and instinctive in the end.<br>  <br>  Uncle Sam and the war is just the movie Across the Universe, a movie which enjoys butchering Beatles songs.|`|bOH5M8cCaa	John Lennon sang this monofonic, as some of the troubadours sang in the Middle Ages: There is no chord behind the melody, but an instrument follows the singer's melody. The song ends with an orchestra arrangement, which was Lennon's idea, and is very much similar to the end of "Entry of the Gods into Valhalla" in "Das Rheingold" by Richard Wagner.  It doesn't have anything to do with Across the Universe, that was just some directors interpretation of Beatles songs, and used their characters and songs and fit it into a story line that made since in Lennon's day, and our day.  It doesn't mean that songs mean what they are interpreted in a movie that Lennon obviously had no hand in making.|`|19cf8567f6e343b050ad5650e90be70baa	Ok the war was going on in that time so people wanted armymen so it's like "I want you" get it?

Talent wise, this season looks like it's going to be a dud.  There has to be the largest number of people who don't have natural dancing talent ever and there were maybe 3 people that were decent.<br>  <br>  There is really no one to root for and there's way more no ones than usual.<br>  <br>  The girl from the Bachelor?  Who is that?  I don't watch that show but if she's got dancing experience that's really not fair. at all.<br>  <br>  I guess I am rooting for Shawn Johnson and Edyta b/c I really like her and I guess Kym Johnson b/c I like her too.|`|TYsw7TzIaa	Shawn and Melissa were my favorites too. <br>  Shawn was my first pick, but after they got Melissa as a replacement, I've been kinda rooting for her.<br>  Gotta love a fellow ballet dancer. =)<br>  I'll be happy if either of them win.|`|bolkuGgVaa	I am cheering for Shawn Johnson and Melissa from the Bachelor.

I thought it was a good show.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	The show was entertaining to say the least. I give credit to alot of the guys for going out of their comfort Zones. <br>  13 couples and i like Shauna and Mark along with Melissa and Tony.i know one thing i wish i had Cheryl Burke's body! Her and Edita are so graceful and sexy that this girl wishes she had their body for just for a small amount of time. They work at it  to the max!|`|JSl1jAPQaa	oh my gosh, i was so interested for the season to begin!<br>  personally, i love shawn johnson, and im hoping she goes far in this competion. she has my votes!! <br>  <br>  cheryl and gilles, did an amazing job. =) <br>  <br>  i didn't like julianne and her boyfriend. i know they are dating, but i didnt feel their chemistry. <br>  <br>  i dont know, maybe within the weeks my mind might change.|`|98213410df5614ac2608fd2a80978670aa	I only watched, because i heard Melissa was going to be on. Man that girl can dance, she was so graceful on the dance floor.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Melissa was great!  I thought they gave Steve Wozniak a bad rap while giving Denise Richards way too high of a score.  <br>  <br>  Little Shawn Johnson is still as cute as she was in the Olympics!|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Melissa's a ringer...she's fantastic!

1G0Db60daa	She doesn't wear a wig... unless you're talking about the future scenes? She wears a wig in those so she wouldn't have to dye her hair brown.<br>  _______<br>  Edit:<br>  Actually, I just found this:<br>  <a href="http://www.glamour.com/beauty/blogs/girls-in-the-beauty-department/2008/09/the-secret-behind-hayden-panet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.glamour.com/beauty/blogs/girl...</a><br>  <br>  So I guess her hair got really damaged, so she cut it short and has to wear a wig and have conditioner on 24/7 to get it healthy again.|`|m80GjPWfaa	She IS wearing a wig and it's because she cut her hair to a short length but when they began filming, her character Claire didin't have short hair and the producers/directors (or whoever) didn't like it becuase it didn't match claire so they made her wear a wig.. and in public i think she uses extensions (like at the 2009 golden globes). hope this helps =]|`|0sR4mnc4aa	Because she cut her hair short in real life and I guess they didn't like that for her character.<br>  <br>  Yeah, it looks ******* stupid.
AA12090277	It's obvious how most users probably never even tried the Zune. :)<br>  <br>  If you're comparing the current Zunes with the iPod Classic, I definitely would think that the Zune wins. Here's why<br>  <br>  1. Nice design - Both are very nice looking, but I think the Zune is better. It's different, yet cool, and the iPod Classic has too much of a utilitarian look to it, and isn't as inviting.<br>  <br>  2. Hardware - Definitely Zune. The brushed aluminum backside is really scratch free (Apple uses the other scratch-prone aluminum back). The plastic front of the Zune has a nice solid texture. The Zune has a BIGGER glass screen. Makes video viewing great. <br>  <br>  3. UI - The user interface on the Zune is much more better and intuitive. The iPod Classic still uses that menu system where you have to keep "digging" in and out to get where you want. Zune one ups it by making it very easy to find what you want in one category, and gets you back to the home screen faster.<br>  <br>  4. Customizability - You can change the background of the menu(easy to identify and looks cool), get your Zune a nickname (you have to register, and hope noone else took it), get special laser engraving at Zune Originals ( <a href="https://zuneoriginals.net/" rel="nofollow">https://zuneoriginals.net/</a> ), cases, accessories, and the usual. <br>  <br>  5. FM Radio - You can catch radio talk shows, news, sports, radio contests, new music, and a bunch of other radio content with the FM Radio. You can also buy a song from a radio station, if there's RDS offered.<br>  <br>  6. WiFi - You can share songs and pictures with other Zune owners, wirelessly connect to your PC, access the Marketplace store, and instantly update your podcasts<br>  <br>  7. Software (computer) - I personally like to manage my music in the Zune software better. iTunes really looks like old spreadsheets compared to the Zune program. Again, the UI on the desktop software is pretty smooth, slick, and simple to go around. Nice transitions, and you can even change the background theme. Also, it uses LESS memory, so it's not as as bad on system resources.<br>  <br>  8. Store - iTunes does have more content, I'll admit. But the offerings on Zune aren't bad. It has almost all the tracks that iTunes has, and there's some TV shows and music videos offered (Increasing every week!). Browsing through Zune Marketplace is cool though! Popular artists have special pages and it looks really neat to browse through. Finding content is much more easier for me. You can also access the store on your device.<br>  <br>  9. Zune Pass - This is an optional way of getting music from the store. Instead of traditionally buying music, you can RENT music for $14.99 a month. You have access to almost all of the store's music tracks, and you can download as many tunes as you want onto your device. After a month, you do have to pay $14.99 to keep your subscription running, or else your songs don't work. But it's a great legal way to get tons of music, for a rather cheap price.If that's not your thing, each song cost 79 points each (99 cents). <br>  <br>  10. MixView - On the Zune software, there's this awesome visualization that comes up when you're playing a song. You really have to take a look : <a href="http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=1dadcc7c-bbed-4e5c-a36a-b6bc44728ed1" rel="nofollow">http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=1dad...</a><br>  <br>  11. Games - The latest Zune firmware contains 2 games: Hexic and Texas Hold'Em. More coming soon.<br>  <br>  You can DOWNLOAD the Zune software right now, and give it a try : <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/software/download/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zune.net/en-us/software/downl...</a><br>  <br>  Also, the Genius feature on the iPod, doesn't even compare to the Zunes. Check out any fair review on the web, and the Zune's Channels and Picks offer a much better music discovery.<br>  <br>  Now if we were comparing the current Zunes to the iPod Touch, that's a bit different. But luckily we are not.|`|OpBFc27iaa	iPod.|`|hA5m65Waaa	Classic<br>  <br>  but Touch >>|`|KHC2oE8iaa	it depends on the buyer. if your going for style nobody beats the ipod. if your in it for features such as blutetooth, a recorder, etc. then its the zune.|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	definitely the ipod....|`|ANcCxdEfaa	iPod.  Hands down.|`|yeGTcTngaa	DEFINITELY THE ZUNE! I have an iPod,  my husband has the Zune.  The Zune has so many more capabilities. I would trade my iPod for sure!|`|wZ9YQc3Caa	ipod, most deffinently|`|VSzF36Ywaa	iPod fo sheezy.|`|hcbY89Praa	Yeah iPod for sure if you're picking between those two.
CvtDsOB4aa	I Don't Believe Amber Will<br>  Have to Give back a Cent <br>  she Helped Mrs C So Much <br>  Jill broke LMAO Would Be So Interesting !!|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I can see this twist coming: Because of how much Kevin would have gone through to save Mrs C and him believing it's her despite what others thought, I can see Mrs C leaving Gloria with the stocks then none of those things will necessarily come into play. As for the DNA and Jill's not being Mrs C's daughter, well l don't really care one way or the other, Jill was a successful woman without Mrs C and l think she'll continue to do well. Also Jill owns half of the mansion by inheritance from P. Chancellor.|`|vqUVWPBAaa	Phillip Chancellor left Jill half the of the Chancellor Mansion so, she and Katherine will continue to be house mates. Victor may have screwed himself by buying Gloria's stock. I doubt seriously that Gloria is going to have to return Victor's money. Everyone else will be elated to learn that Katherine is alive, Amber and Esther already are aware that they must give up their millions and the mansion. They could careless about about the goodies. <br>  Victor's will was reversed when Michael petitioned the courts, however his will was not nearly as detailed as Katherine's. Exactly how much of one quarter of one half of sixty thousand million billion dollars (LOL) is. I know that is NOT what her will said, but I was like what the heck, when her will was being read.|`|7JIhZ0R0aa	I'm just glad Katherine is home safe and well.  She's a smart one and things will work out. Amber has been a good friend and probably will be allowed to keep the money. And I sure hope Greedy Gloria's share will be cancelled.<br>  And where is Kevin?<br>  And as for Billy, why is he having a fling with Sharon? Gish !<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Sally-Your comment on Ashley came along and now in 2 weeks time, so it seems, Victor is head over heels in love.<br>  C'mon, how long did he really know Sabrina and was head over heels in love?<br>  At least Ashley and Victor go way back. At least he's not returning to Nikki.|`|YJlCKreSaa	I bet Amber will get the money.  She's been such a good friend to Mrs. C.  Victor not running Jabot is awesome.  And if Billy loses his job- would it really matter?  He doesn't do crap.  I am very interested to see what will happen to Jill and Gloria, also.  Victor gave Glo money for something that isn't good anymore.  Will he insist on getting it back...and Jill has been so nasty.  I hope she gets kicked to the curb.|`|939a573d51518cee62321893077ea36baa	I really want it to be proved soon jill can eat her words|`|J3yUXKiyaa	I'm willing to bet Mrs. C tells Amber to keep the $, that she'd rather see it benefit Amber now rather than making it a hardship for her.<br>  <br>  Some fast footwork will be done to figure out the DNA link/lack thereof between Katherine and Jill...Billy may lose his job, but he's still an Abbott heir, so he'll be just fine.|`|zvrbrNfgaa	vashtiva, i hope her character doesn't have that baby, she's too old to be doing that. and victor can barely hold on to relationships with the children he has. but to answer this question, i was wondering what will happen to murphy. will she play him to the left? i'd hate for him to be forgotten after he took such good care of her for so long.|`|rnfxNYx3aa	Y&R bugs me big time with the Sabrina story that just went away in such a stupid manner.  Victor was devastated until (phew) Ashley came along and now in 2 weeks time, so it seems, he is head over heels in love with yet another baby on the way. <br>  <br>  Now dragging this thing out with Mrs. C not remembering a darned thing again.  Jeez Y&R get some better writers with NEW ideas and now Adam is going blind!|`|rYA2KCnUaa	What you are saying makes a lot of since, and as far as Victor I wonder does Ashley know that he has a share going on the Jabot? Spoilers are raving that Ashley is going to have complications in her pregnancy.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Yep..maybe that is why jill is denie her as her mother|`|EPPb5pRBaa	So much drama  I wish it would just end it and the truth all comes out.|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	It sounds like there are lots of twists and turns in store for us!|`|ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	couldn't happen to a bunch of nicer folk|`|AA10821695	Peaches, I had seen one spoiler say that Mrs C is going to tell Jill (and someone else) that she is really Marge. That really doesn't make sense to me because, her character is not scheduled to depart the series.<br>  I believe Amber will get to keep her money; Jill may turn out NOT to be Mrs. C's daughter; as far as Victor and Jabot is concerned, it really wouldn't make him any difference anyway! Instead I say that he needs to tend to Ashley, with her OLD butt trying to have another child!!!!!|`|uYo3Y7Geaa	Yeah that is soo true umm but I'm soooo mad about the Murphy thing, I can't believe {but I knew it would happen} I just hope they fall in love again.

Don't be embarrased or anything its probably the best show on cartoon network right now.|`|MRcPIYtcaa	No, I'm 16 and I really like that show. I started watching it one weekend and I was hooked. I thought Courtney and Duncan would of been a cute couple, but she got voted off! Has the second season started yet?

WxQFe0GYaa	Denise was terrible!  Melissa was one of my favorites, and so was Shawn Johnson.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i like Shauna and Mark with Tony and Melissa in second for my favorites. i give credit to Ty, Steve O and Apple mogul Steve W,for going out there out of their comfort zones. <br>  My least favorite couple would be Belinda and her partner. Loved the Go Go's but i think she could have done a little better.|`|TfijWwsYaa	I either want Melissa, Lil Kim, Belinda, Denise, or Shawn heck I like all of them.|`|peQGGFPYaa	melissa is my favorite, i loved her on the bachelor and it was crappy what she had to go through and no she didnt know that she was going to have the happiest day of her life and then to be completely humiliated afterwards.<br>  but oh well im glad to see her on here and happy. hope she wins :-)|`|wFy80O73aa	sorryyyy ...but Melissa is my favorite, and I don't think some of the other ''has beens'' are any more famous now that she is, and I am sure she ll be around for a while. I like stev-o, and the guy with cheryl , too. <br>  I don't really care for the gogo girl, the gymnast,the cowboy,|`|JSl1jAPQaa	My favorite: Shawn Johnson<br>  Least favorite: Ty Murray|`|fmB9MWdfaa	My favorite so far is Shawn Johnson and Mark Ballas<br>  umm. my least favorite is Karina and the co-founder of apple (I can't even remember his name)<br>  Yea, I'm not that much of a fan of Melissa either, she is not that famous, just a reality star that happened to be engaged and then dumped by a bachelor.<br>  I'm very curious for the rest of the season!|`|qLWexlkdaa	i loveeee Steve-O, Shawn, and Melissa :D|`|y2XKYhsyaa	steveo.<3|`|AP81B3Fqaa	i love julianne hough and chuck wicks they look so good together!|`|CLKTzVBuaa	steveo for sure!! :)
9EW08emXaa	The New Moon "previews" on youtube are fan-made.  They are just clips from other movies...some scenes from Twilight, some scenes from other movies that the actors were in.|`|iQAGeVjsaa	You havent seen footage from it, because they just started filming it like this week. How do you see something that doesnt exist|`|Jf9EBze2aa	I'm sure you're seeing fan made videos<br>  <br>  Most of the videos I just looked at just have clips from movies that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have been in<br>  <br>  Such as this "trailer" with over 3,000,000 hits<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_cezpJQh_Y&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_cezpJQh...</a><br>  <br>  At  :20, it's a clip of Kristen Stewart in the movie "The Messengers"<br>  It even shows clips from Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban at 1:20<br>  <br>  Obviously, if they haven't started filming, there are no trailers|`|W4JIdJEjaa	well they start filming in before the film date to get a head start|`|HRtqw6cbaa	They havent, it is just scenes from other movies with thoe actors in them|`|XGCHYkwFaa	just someone making a fake trailer with scenes from diff. movies|`|6BRglHwBaa	They have started filming! :)<br>  well... thats what i hear... but who knows.. theres always malicious twilight rumors floating around<br>  <br>  but yeah the thing you saw on youtube was probably just made by some crazed fan..<br>  there are tons of them out there.
de7bf90bb2066bf0f7dc80a921ffc779aa	Absolutely,|`|mN4PIcRqaa	yes|`|mSt1LGfjaa	i sure do ,,and i do give them a second chance if they prove they are truly sorry..|`|ZhUmY8b3aa	it depends on what and how u did it<br>  like murder by torture or a gun or a knife<br>  <br>  hell no <br>  no 2nd chance 4 u|`|XF1y4wMmaa	Yeah. Only 2 chances. After that it is not worth it!!|`|grifjdr0aa	That's up to God.  But I ain't given any pedophiles a 2nd chance.|`|fC5X8swbaa	I think so. :]|`|ns1F0p8Laa	Yes I do even a third chance.  I am not to keen on second chances but I know if I would have done something that I needed forgiveness for I would hope someone forgive me so I do the same.  one time is a mistake the second time ok they knew what they were doing but u could hope that they would learn and the third time is just ridiculus and no excuse.  I think the closest thing to love is forgiveness.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Depends on how they screwed up the first one. People have done things to me that I just don't believe they are sorry for. Also, they've done things that can't be fixed with an apology. If someone does something over and over they're done though. I don't want to spend every moment in a relationship forgiving them for something stupid.|`|0muvYszmaa	Well in my opinion it depends on what they did I don't think Ted Bundy, Charles Manson or Hitler deserve a second chance, but for things like cursing you out and stealing they deserve to have a second chance.|`|AA10671142	it depends on what they did to you. sometimes it is real hard to forgive someone. it does take time. the problem is after you forgive them you can't forget what they did or say to you|`|K4GiKOhPaa	Depends on the severity of the offense. I'd never take someone back who cheated on me. That would just give them permission to do it again.|`|shaO0coWaa	It depends on what they did,but not always|`|D3hLhqR7aa	Nope.|`|baR28Sq4aa	I agree with you....but def not a third....|`|5NIKZPqpaa	yes everyone deserves it. small and big things they made against to you or to anyone weigh the same in the sight of God. and He truly forgive us if we confess and ask forgivenes...|`|7ipQMC8Vaa	Only if they're really and truly sorry for what they did, and they're willing to change. Of course, there's no way of knowing that for sure...|`|NWkPzcEvaa	Depends on the situation. =]<br>  <br>  Second date, sure<br>  <br>  Second chance of not killing an innocent toddler F*CK NO!!!!!|`|OCHhJWpHaa	yeah u're right...everyone deserve a second chance...<br>  but second chance doesnt always comes in handy...|`|6a302ded0cb3ae070fbcb6449e4449efaa	No way. <br>  How do you know if they're truly sorry? Maybe they're lying.<br>  More likely they're truly sorry they got caught.|`|f2b1a09b580fe9049bc28c8e845abd3aaa	Of course, everyone deserves second chance.|`|AA10196782	i agree with you. if they honestly regret what they have done and are willing to correct themselves, then yes, they should get a second chance.|`|Jh83QYVjaa	Of course everyone deserves a second chance, but they mess up the next time and its over... though i kinda dont follow that rule with everyone....lol|`|ElAy3yQBaa	nobody deserves nothing.<br>  people have to earned things|`|fN23bHi0aa	Depends on their record of 2nd chances and what they did.|`|8HtC4j33aa	hmmmm...<br>  depends on the person and the thing theyy did.<br>  im a very forgiving person <br>  buttt just somethings i could never forgive!!|`|M8kNmWuAaa	no, if they purposely kill someone without the act of self defense. they deserve to rot in hell.|`|IHa6FxE6aa	No.|`|cYFAo75Yaa	not with me...one and done|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yes, I agree with you.|`|1neMZoRLaa	does everyone? heck no!<br>  <br>  what about the person who massacred a whole family?<br>  <br>  will saying sorry bring back the family?<br>  <br>  will miraculously  "finding "religion in jail bring back the family? no<br>  <br>  also, I can think one person  that doesn't deserve a 2nd chance it's the jonas brothers|`|JblWZcbbaa	It depends on what they did.<br>  <br>  If a girlfriend lies to a boyfriend about hanging out with someone or some stupid thing like that, then ya, they deserve a second chance to not lie or something again.<br>  <br>  If somebody murders someone, they PROOOOBABLY don't deserve a second chance, you know what I'm saying?|`|FOeWqr0qaa	As long as they have apologized and seem promising to chance/never do what they did again then I will give them many chances. <br>  Maybe I'm too nice but unless you really really hurt me I am forgiving.<br>  <br>  I wish other people were as forgiving as I am though, it would make life a lot easier.|`|2jMFurDoaa	it depends. most times yes every one deserves a second chance. i can forgive very easily if they show me they are truly sorry!<br>  <br>  however if someone cheated on me then hell no! ive made that mistake, once a cheater always a cheater. thats just something i couldnt ever forgive|`|htcfyWblaa	Yeah we all make mistakes, I have had second chances that I really needed. Unless someone did something inhumane , they should have a second chance !|`|iz7iVS5Baa	Not always<br>  <br>  <br>  I just murdered 12 people, but I'm really sorry. So, can we just forget about this whole lethal injection thing if I promise not do it again?<br>  <br>  <br>  Yeah right...|`|OegheALwaa	yeah they have to be very sorry and beg for a second chance. <br>  also it depends on what they did.|`|SH5WQN0Jaa	i think sometimes they do, but i don't think the one who broke my heart will say he is sorry and make up for it...|`|HP4eFPHjaa	90% of the time a second chance turns into a third chance show no sympathy people will take advantage of you in this world|`|zmNg5YNQaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  But after that chance I don't believe they are truly sincere anymore. I simply lose faith in them.|`|5AB1dtx4aa	i think everyone deserves a second chance|`|WHcBV7rLaa	Not everyone. Some things are beyond redemption|`|ztzL7ntwaa	It depends on what they have done~~~|`|xZQjK7oKaa	Hell no. It takes once to mess up.|`|5662062552f2e2632d711ca7960440a6aa	Like Doctor Who said, "No second chances."|`|mLN3zhaSaa	Uhm.<br>  Depends on what they did to lose their first chance.|`|D9iE2JBKaa	I think that they should , but they have to be Truly sorry for what they did|`|WLijeQB6aa	Do you think Hitler or Saddam Insane should have had a second chance?|`|m6ZW67ojaa	No. People don't change.|`|GZVqEEDraa	Yes...|`|YzdKR5MWaa	Oh Hell No!|`|FLFWzXMNaa	Depends. Sometimes no, but most of the time yes!|`|IWzdqPGTaa	Not Rosie O`Donnell.|`|mDzOujJQaa	ya i agree with you|`|HuhI1IlJaa	nope..some deeds are really bad...i guess u'll find out in time

hmNY4gQtaa	I have some fears of my own but not that one, the only fear I have about that is when you are in a really complicated subject, asking a question that is not relevant or intelligent enough, <br>  <br>  I also am afraid of taking too much time on small detail and slowing down the process or losing sight of the bigger picture and missing the more important points. <br>  <br>  It's important to leave everyone enough space to ask questions because everyone has a different perspective and those perspective can lead us in all kinds of different directions. When the direction is good than great, it's very very good, but if its not and it's causing us to lose some speed than you kind of want to give a rebuff to the person asking it... Indeed asking the right questions is an art.|`|KwNpyp3saa	Sometimes it is a little daunting asking questions here. I guess with the anonymity of it all, some just feel free to say whatever they feel like saying. Mostly not offering any support to the person who has a problem and is looking for answers, a little guidance. <br>  <br>  Another reason it may be difficult to ask questions here is because of the answers we do get. We are then made to face reality and have to make a decision. Maybe we worry too much what our contacts might think. I know, kind of silly to feel this way of people we don't know and haven't met. Maybe they might think we are just neurotic and second guess why they are our contacts.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	I answer many, many more than I ask.  The criticism can be a little rough at times.  I think you just need to take it at face value, and realize most people here are just trying to be funny and entertaining.  And, most answers are - especially if you ask good questions.  Some questions are ridiculous, and are going to get ridiculous/critical answers.<br>  <br>  Plus, so many questions have been asked already.  I see the same ones pop up every other day.  You do have to be quite original here, but not out of your mind.|`|kiD47XbTaa	Definitely, I mean I just asked a question and some guy wrote:<br>  <br>  How is that question useful to anyone?<br>  It's not. Why don't you solve some problems instead of bitching?<br>  Or... you could leave.<br>  <br>  I mean, I wasn't even bitching!<br>  It can really hurt my feelings, so I tend to just look and see if somebody else has asked it. I mean, I just can't believe people would write some horrible messages and stuff. It really annoys me. I mean, if I asked the same question to there face, I bet you a million dollars that they wouldn't respond with the same answer! <br>  And sometimes people will reply with "The answer is......duh!" and go on about how easy it was. Well, it might be easy for them but it wasn't for me!|`|T8u2IM51aa	it's not difficult at all..<br>  often, i can take even the smallest thought and turn it into a question..<br>  <br>  but i've asked all i need to know..and some days i feel like this site is being invaded by adolescents..it makes the question asking a little pointless since it won't be taken seriously..|`|AA12150970	the only thing i don't like is that if you accidentally spell something wrong or use wrong grammar you get about 10 answers telling you what mistakes you made and you only get about 5 people actually trying to answer your question.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, I do.  It's easy to come up with a Question, but it seems the more questions that I ask, the more Violation Notices I get.  So therefore, I don't ask questions much anymore on this website.|`|1G0Db60daa	No, I'm not afraid because I will never see most of these people in real life anyways... that's what Y!A is for, answering and asking questions.

I just asked if you like my moustached smiley face :{||`|CArzkDIUaa	Yeah, because I like to be original. not something like "am i pretty" or what not|`|fC5X8swbaa	Its usually just because I cant think of anything good to askk. :]|`|de7bf90bb2066bf0f7dc80a921ffc779aa	Yes, I can never think of good questions to ask,|`|QEqGukjZaa	yeah...my energy is like not there to ask questions|`|mtV7dWJHaa	Not if I give serious thought to what I'm asking.  However I have come up with some questions that I have regretted asking.  Guess I need to be in the right frame of mind - that would mean being clever enough to attract fun or serious answers.|`|AA11591747	Yes I am scared to chose the best Answer.|`|cYFAo75Yaa	nope... that's what this is all about, different opinions and views...|`|r8s5j6zOaa	I get no respect|`|ACa1N4Jdaa	I just ask stupid questions.

Go to a speech therapist and work on it.|`|grifjdr0aa	It's called thought blocking.  Are you on some meds, or just dope.  Lots of bipolar meds cause it.  I take topamax and it happens to me all the time.  I want to keep taking it cuz it helps my moods and my headaches, and I'm losing weight on it, but I can't put a thought together from start to end, it sucks.|`|xLO5VRYTaa	I do to but I DO have psychological illnesses. I like typing better because I get to check before I enter :P<br>  <br>  It could be dyslexia- someone who has it was telling me about it and that was one of his symptoms|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Looks like there is|`|i6QfwNTJaa	i call that my "golden foot in my mouth"|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	I would suggest you seeing a neurologist - seriously.

4imsjgE2aa	Actually you haven't missed anything. The last new episode shown was -<br>  <br>  Episode 16: "Screenwriter's Blues"<br>  <br>  Peyton begins to plan the wedding, Lucas attempts to put a cast together for his movie. Meanwhile, Haley is faced with a difficult decision, and Nathan gets great news.<br>  <br>  Aired: 2/2/2009<br>  <br>  <br>  We have a little longer to wait for a new episode -<br>  <br>  Episode 17: You And Me And The Bottle Makes Three Tonight - 3/16/09<br>  <br>  Episode 18: Searching For a Former Clarity - 3/23/09<br>  <br>  Episode 19: Letting Go - 4/13/09<br>  <br>  They were on a little break.  It seems that they don't make enough episodes to air each week of the season.  I am glad it is still on!|`|v0FlUan0aa	i hope they still keep going. but its getting a bit old. there should only be one more season after this, i think bc after Lucas and peyton get married, there wont be anything else to talk about.|`|Vs2fxET0aa	Yes. There Wil Be at least one more season except there is some bad news. Peyton and Luke will not be returning.|`|CBuUT81naa	i dont know how many but there is still atleast one more season
764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	LOL My friends always laugh because I get so drawn into the story that I get mad when things aren't explained or something contradicts something I've seen earlier in the movie. I feel like "I could've done a much better job"; it makes me feel that I should be a movie editor. I can predict where the loop hole will be. <br>  <br>  Geez.. I need to get a life! LOL|`|AA10913242	pissedoff|`|2886b6e84a1c433bb64a91170ce39455aa	Makes me kind of mad sometimes...like this could've happened, could happen, but who knows...Unless there's a sequel, I need closure on it...|`|4e0a36dbc08a9efa386e5cf868cec423aa	A few things---sometimes I feel kinda angry that the director or writer doesn't have enough confidence in the audience that they wouldn't be smart enough to figure it out.  Sometimes, I get frustrated thinking that the director half-assed it or wasn't making great decisions in the editing process.  And lastly (this doesn't put blame on the production), I think that maybe it was intentional to set up a sequel or to leave you feeling anxious or uncertain.|`|aeeaf40068c054c1dfd28d1ed12f6629aa	I feel frustrated, extremely frustrated.  It makes me too anxious to see the next movie.|`|c410f1c7a419a88ba8520163db565864aa	i feel cheated!! aaarrgghh!!!<br>  i hate it when movies have loopholes!!!|`|107c2a0021096b0baebd3759242f121caa	I find it annoying.  If it is a book, article or film, I feel the writer didn't do a very good job, although sometimes this is deliberate to allow the reader/viewer to draw their own conclusions.<br>  <br>  If it is a story being told to me by a person, I become a little suspicious.  Are they simply not coherent in communicating their ideas, or are they trying to deceive me?  In those cases, I will usually give them another chance to see if they are really consistent but not effectively communicating, or if it is something else.|`|AA11200941	cheated. it is as if there are no intelligent people on the set. it's like, they are more concerned in getting more revenue than giving a story with sense. if there are so many loopholes in a movie, it shows that no one even thought of questioning the script. add top A actors and voilah! top grosser!

NPAQxqgNaa	Sadly, most projects have become known for heavy gang activity.  Here in LA, it's too dangerous to go to the areas where the projects are especially at night because anyone and everyone (police and ambulance workers included) are considered targets by the gangs.  You may have a real emergency, but some places the ambulances aren't allowed to go in without backup or protection which will slow things down a lot.|`|f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	Maybe it's because there are only so many ambulances and hundreds of thousands of people in any one district. If all the ambulances are out on other emergencies you have to pretty much just wait your turn.<br>  I know it sucks but that's just the way it is.|`|e8QQW8Weaa	haha uhmm i realize your joking, but legally there supposed to be there in 5 minutes maximum!|`|ZsgCxVo5aa	That's how long it takes to play a round of Texas Hold Em to see who the loosing team is!|`|54601f6ca2b038fe7a92154c08ebd2c9aa	Idk.

I used to live in the projects in the 60s and I can see why, no one wants to go in them. You don't know if you'll come out alive.<br>  When these folks signed up as ambulance personnel, they were never offered combat pay, but that's what they need if they are going to go in there.|`|773a0ef61688dd825e941d816e68d310aa	Because the tires get stolen as soon as the ambulance reaches the 'hood.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	They are on Go Slow|`|cYFAo75Yaa	they are drawing straws...best 4 out of 7 wins the right not to go...
AA10348541	I don't think that Chris Brown is a player. He is a young boy with some talent and a lot of energy.

No way out for the rich, and no excuses for anybody else. Even those with physical and mental handicaps could serve in some capacity, not everybody would have to be a soldier, just those physically and mentally capable of being active duty soldiers, sailors and airmen.

There's a lot of soul mates in our lives that we recognize when we meet or soon after as people who come in our lives to teach us, to help us grow, or to lean on us as they evolve.  So basically, I agree with you.  Everyone in our lives can teach us something, and we can help everyone around us as well -- but some people you have a higher purpose for meeting -- usually family members, a lover/spouse, a great friend, or a total stranger that makes you realize something you never knew before.<br>  <br>  I bottle it up in fate, but there's a grander plan that we're all acting under to learn as much as we can, and soul mates are the people that help us and that we help along the way.<br>  <br>  ... in my opinion. :)

There's one called "The Manchurian Candidate".  There's another called "Point of No Return".  Also consider historical movies.  They might be about hope or not giving up.  Remember "The Alamo"?<br>  <br>  There's always something in a movie if you just look.  Very few stories don't have a message of some type.  Try watching a Star Trek movie.  An exception might be a movie like "The Blob".  I know of no hidden meaning there.  What about "The Day the Earth Stood Still"?<br>  <br>  Two more that might be harder to find are "If a Man Answers", and "How to Murder Your Wife".  The last two are classics about relationships.  They are also comedies.|`|8Zy7SOlkaa	hmmm movies with a message.<br>  1.

Church picnics are nice, but some people really need help at the moment. If you wanted to try helping for both, you could do the charity work and drop off a specialty dish at the church picnic. =)

I was like floating up in the air and invisible to everyone but myself. I was watching little kids playing with toys and talking to the 20-year-olds who worked there (oddly enough I remember them wearing purple t's) when this man charged into the building with a staple-gun.<br>  <br>  He asked everyone how they wanted to die (even the little kids). He'd then set up stations where each person was to be killed and have them line up there. Then the killing began.<br>  <br>  I remember he had one of those shallow kiddy pools filled with water and a shark. He threw one of the workers into the pool and the shark ate him. He also drowned a kid.<br>  <br>  Most of the kids requested to be staple-gunned and chose to be taped or stapled (with a standard paper stapler) to the wall or the cubbies after dying. The man had them stand in a circle around him and then he'd spin around sending friggin huge staples flying around everywhere, killing them. Then he taped or stapled them to the wall and cubbies.<br>  <br>  Man, I am disturbed.|`|6DKMnAJJaa	i had a nightmare that my freinds cousins were on a balcony with no balcony underneath and my 2 cousins were in their arms and one of them let them go and i sed dont u f***ing dare!!!  n   absolutly nuts

Floss, toothbrushes, combs, make-up, an orange, Silly Putty, clay, chapstick.. I can't recall getting anything bad in a stocking.. Oh, I guess the time I got baby powder was a bit awkward. My response was akin to, "What the hell?" I kept bugging my family about it all day and finally my grandmother just turned me and was like, "IT'S TO PUT UNDER YOUR BOOBS SO THEY DON'T GET SWEATY." ..Yeah, I stopped questioning stocking gifts after that.<br>  <br>  3. Where is your second (even third) home?<br>  - The mall, I suppose.<br>  <br>  4. What color is your skirt/pants/whatever you're wearing?<br>  - Very, very pale pink.<br>  <br>  5. What are your favorite stores at the mall?<br>  - The Food Court of Miracles doesn't count as a store, does it? CVS..<br>  <br>  6. What was the last thing you ate?<br>  - Mashed potatoes.<br>  <br>  7. What was the last movie that you saw in theatres?<br>  - Um. Um. Um. OH, it was that movie with Clive Owen. I only agreed to go because I enjoy his accent. It was.. ah.. The International? I might be confused. <br>  <br>  BONUS!!!<br>  Is this a good idea for an AMV type thing? I wanted to make an Alice in Wonderland one with the song Holiday by Weezer.<br>  - I am unfamiliar with that song. I've never been a big Weezer fan.

UsGJAmLhaa	She was an hourglass because her bust measurement usually equalled or outweighed her hip measurement. Marilyn was a C-cup for most of her career, though she gained a good amount of weight in the 1958-1960 time period in which her photos would suggest she was a D-cup. At the time of her death she was the thinnest she had been in her adult life (117lbs according to her autopsy report) and judging by her topless photos from the 1962 Last Sitting photoshoot, she looked to be a B-cup. Her bras auctioned in Christie's were also most B-cups, however, wearing bras too small was a common trick to give lift.|`|xqQO81Omaa	She was a classic hourglass shape. Her measurements were around 36-24-36 at the height of her career, which would probably have put her at a 30E. But More than likely she probably wore a 34D or 36C as so many women wear the wrong bra size, adding several inches to the underbust measurement which throws off the cup size.|`|t7ub48nxaa	She was definitely an hour-glass shape.  At the Christies(1999) auction of Marilyn Monroe's personal property there were four bustiers sold.  Two were 36B, one was unlabeled and the other was a 36C.  In 2005 at the Julien's Auction of the remaining garments not included in the Christies sale, there were dozens of her bras sold. Again, there was a mixture of 36B and 36C sizes.  So it appears that at some point in her life she wore both a 36B and 36C.|`|bltgAc9Maa	It was hourglass. A pear-shaped would be someone like J.Lo and Beyonce. I don't know about her bra-size. I think at some point at her career, when she posed for Playboy, the magazine wrote it 34B or C. Sorry I kinda forgot.<br>  <br>  I got this from wikipedia, her stats from Playboy in December 1953:<br>  Bust: 36 in (91 cm)<br>  Waist: 24 in (61 cm)<br>  Hips: 34 in (86 cm)<br>  Height: 5 ft 5 in (1.65 m)<br>  Weight: 118 lb (54 kg)|`|AA11892740	Definitely hour-glass.

A man is in his living room teasing his cat with a laser light.  A couple of his friends come in and decide to tease him. They have a bag of Doritos going around the house and he is chasing it just like the cat had chased the laser light.  :)|`|fPwgtACiaa	Those etrade commercials with that awsome baby.

DxKDfoFJaa	I like all of those bands.<br>  Yeah I get judged by my family and other Mexicans about the music I listen to.<br>  Apparently, Mexicans are supposed to listen to 50 cent and other Hiphop music...<br>  The music I listen to is "scary and satanic"<br>  I like a lot of "emo" things so Im ostrasized by other kids of my race.<br>  I prefer guys in skinny pants over guys in saggy pants.<br>  Screamo over Rap.<br>  Barbells over Hoop earrings.<br>  Converse over Reebok.<br>  Tripp over Baby Phat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BA: since the Summer of '07|`|kP0JGI1waa	You have a diverse taste, which I think is great for a person to have.  I mean we all have our favorite genres but I like it when people can respect multiple styles of music, even if they aren't completely in love with all of them.  Nice one with Pink Floyd, they are the kind of band you have to respect, such thought and creativity.  <br>  <br>  BQ: I have listened to Black Sabbath for approximately 4 years, I really only started seriously getting into music then, now I am a music addict!  btw to the guy who said RATM, they are one of my faves too, nice!|`|RvnBuOROaa	no.  to be honest i think that's pretty basic.<br>  <br>  metal, indie, prog, etc.  <br>  <br>  i'm into stuff like folk (fingerstyle country bluegrass kind), jazz, any kind of metal, rock (not new mainstream), electronic, expierimental, world, old school rap, any genre you give me i can name a person on my iPod or that i want to be on my iPod (don't have enough money for +5000 songs right now).<br>  <br>  H.I.M. (Don't diss. they make good music if you listen to it... not paying attention to what others think) since 3rd grade. im in 8th.<br>  The Black Dahlia Murder since 7th grade.<br>  both are my favs of all time.  current favorite always changes.  so for 5 years, 1 1/2 year for all time...  <br>  Currently it's Pavement (2-3 weeks)<br>  or white stripes (1-2 years)|`|r4xKaZ37aa	No. I think everyone has their own taste in music. Whatever floats your boat. I personally only like Pink Floyd out of your list.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ: Since I first heard Love in an Elevator when I was like 4.<br>  10 years of Rockin' to Aerosmith.|`|dFacbjIZaa	It's not a dumb question Gig. You like what You like, and that's the way it should be. You don't need anyone's approval to justify what You like. <br>  <br>  BA: 26 years. They've only been My favorite for 2 years though.|`|xZQjK7oKaa	Haha no, I listen to everything from Paper Planes to Comfortably Numb. It's one of those "guilty pleasure" things for me.<br>  <br>  BQ: For around 4 years, maybe? Nirvana.|`|OWdoFmKqaa	<---enjoys listening to Jason Mraz and Dying Fetus.<br>  <br>  So having a diverse taste in music is rather interesting. Sticking to one particular genre or a few others sounds pretty dull to me.|`|8RkYlaQxaa	Not at all! Your choice in music is just fine with me. No need to be ashamed for being yourself.<br>  <br>  BA: 14 years- Rage Against the Machine. I saw them play at my first concert when I was 8.|`|5HYvlXUlaa	No....its called your taste in music because its "YOUR" taste in music. <br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you how to live your life.|`|7qt4aQGYaa	Since I heard "Hey You" on the radio, so about two years.<br>  <br>  judging by your name, you know what band i am talking about|`|jlKj1W6Haa	i only like pink floyd from your list<br>  <br>  i've only listened to my favorite band for maybe, 6 years.|`|qnwe2E3caa	dude, your music is fine!<br>  <br>  Red Hot Chili Peppers - For quite a long time now.|`|4lTsTliJaa	that's not strange at all.  it's average teen music.<br>  i've been listening to my favorite band for about 10-15 years.|`|SkFgDxpEaa	no you don't. i am like you too. and i think that is the best way to go.<br>  i like some hip hop, some rock, some punk rock, some pop punk and some pop. so i think you have the perect taste in musc.<br>  <br>  i have been listening to LP for just over a year and a half|`|YlCgMDVwaa	I would consider it pretty normal.<br>  <br>  BA: The Devil Wears Prada- 4 years.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  It's called NOT being a lemming.  ou like what YOU like, insteadd of following a crowd or a trend.<br>  <br>  That is how it SHould be.<br>  <br>  I love Iron Maiden, Johnny Cash, the Corrs, John Clotrane and Fleshmould?<br>  <br>  What does that say about me?  Jsut that I like those bands.<br>  <br>  Your taste in music is perfect..for you.  And that si all that matters.<br>  <br>  And it is not a dumb question.  It seems like today everyone expects people to fit into THIER preconcieved ideas of things... too bad for them that people that actually think for themsleves don't tend to do that very well.<br>  <br>  BQ- Iron Maiden, for 23 years.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	I've only heard one of those bands, so I can't say, but I rarely think someone has strange music taste. <br>  Don't worry, people say the same about the music I like.<br>  <br>  BQ- <br>  Everclear- 9 years<br>  The Smashing Pumpkins- 5 years|`|DbtS5jzEaa	No..your music taste is diverse...nothing wrong with that!<br>  <br>  Bright Eyes is EPIC!!!<br>  <br>  BA: almost 4 years now :)|`|UnsZKr4saa	Very eclectic, not strange at all.<br>  <br>  BQ: A year.|`|utTFiz3gaa	To be honest i only know one out of the 5 you have listed but that doesn't mean you have weird taste in music. Who am i to judge you on that? I think music is so universal and even though we all have such different tastes we all love what we love and it shouldn't matter if another person likes/dislikes what you like or dislike. (Yes that means the Jobro lovers do have opinions and can like whatever they like.. even though it makes me sick with disgust inside...) Since i am an eclectic listener myself i am always okay with those who have diverse interests also, kinda tells you that you are open to anything<br>  <br>  BQ: I have been listening to rage against the machine for 2 1/2 years... yeah i still consider myself a newbie fan to the band :P<br>  <br>  p.s. Mr. Pink i LOVE rage too!! :D|`|oOSNI3wbaa	everybody has different taste in music. not everyone is going to like what you listen to and you're not always going to like what they listen to. thats just the way it is. if listening to what you listen to makes you happy, then do it. dont worry about what other people think about it. music is meant to be enjoyed.<br>  <br>  BQ: ever since i heard the RUST IN PEACE album. ive been hooked ever since. its megadeth, by the way.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Haha, people tell me im weird because i talk about/listen grunge music alot. A kid who brings gas masks to school told me i was weird A KID WHO BRINGS GAS MASKS FOR GODS SAKE.<br>  <br>  I like Bright Eyes and Pink Floyd, the people who judge you probably listen to like soulja boy. I dont think your taste is weird or anything.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Ahem - I love Bright Eyes.<br>  Thanks.<br>  Currently my playlist involves Buck 65, Bright Eyes, the Decemberists, Kaskade, Atmosphere, Avenged Sevenfold, and David Bowie. Who's random?|`|7B2s7maWaa	No of course not.  You are very open minded and your music selection is very diverse.  Which is great.  :)<br>   <br>  bq: 6 Years <br>  <br>  No this is not a dumb question, please do not worry about that.|`|3g3SCnDDaa	Your taste in music is fine. :)<br>  Don't worry too much about it, diversity is always a good thing. This isn't a dumb question at all. Peace.<br>  <br>  BQ: 3-4 years now.|`|IqhD4JCCaa	I just love how see everybody lying about 2 or more people I've seen that has bash on those bands<br>  <br>  I don't think its strange your just open different types of music|`|ebxwADDcaa	not really. <br>  <br>  people tell me im strange though because i listen to black metal and stuff like that, but ill also listen to stuff like my chemical romance or Calyx
b6a6ae1ec756493542f2d34dc7f21302aa	Simple Plan!!! They really interact with the crowd and keep it alive. I didn't get bored at their concert and was always on my feet jumping up and down and shouting my lungs out. They are down to earth and not all stuck up like a lot of other performers.

Maybe you can donate some food or blankets or any spare clothing you may have. <br>  <br>  If you make a difference in Just even one life you are making a big difference. Hang tight. The world is going downhill fast, hold on to yourself and those that you can hold onto|`|8SyUHkPXaa	This is not peculiar to Sacramento.  There have been and will be homeless and hungry people all over this planet as long as the world is in existance.<br>  <br>  It's hard I think, when you become aware of the injustices of this world for the first time.  I think many grown ups become apathetic to the plights of humankind.<br>  <br>  It may be hard to believe, but many homeless people actually prefer to be homeless.  I know it's sad and hard to believe.  <br>  <br>  But nobody prefers to be hungry, thirsty or lonely.<br>  <br>  You should read this book called "Under the Overpass" and it will give you a real eye opening perspective of what it's like to be homeless and in many cases, hopeless.|`|f3pu5FAFaa	when i was in baltimore it was bad  we decided to drive near  a bridge and the was makeshift houses everywhere and ughh it was so sad . i wish i could help but where i live you also have the people whom hold up signs  outside of the base that say war vet and have no job ( but are very well dressed and groomed) and ask for money .

GZKV0guAaa	awwe ya i was in your shoes last year,  he lead me on and it took<br>  me a exactly a whole year to forget about him plus i also moved to a <br>  new school where i met this really cute guy whom i am now best <br>  friends with (flirting friends to be exact ;] ) and now i can't even believe  that i used to like my first crush that i used to cry about at night! i waited and someone better for me came along (my first crush was a stoner and a bada$$, wth was wrong with me?!) so i guess now i'm in love 8) Don't worry, time heals all bruises and heartaces, trust me. Sooner or later when you meet your right guy, you'll be thinking "what was I thinking?!"<br>  <br>  goodluck darling, and if you're in high school remember: high school guys aren't worth it! single is the way to go and be footloose and fancy free, flirt as much as you want, go on G.N.O's with your girlfriends.... remember the saying "if you go looking for love, it will never appear. Live your life and love will find you from under a rock" (meaniing when you least expect it.<br>  <br>  P.S: wish me luck with my crush, i'm hoping he asks me out before<br>  formal :]|`|d33ff6b12876ab19368e1b44c245857caa	well, honey, been there done that (a couple of times). I am at the moment, in love! Although things have their ups and downs, all relationships  take a little work, struggles, and challenges to help you appreciate it when you get the real thing!|`|GhsqaXsdaa	Heartbroken. :,'(|`|PzbRJrTKaa	heartbroken, trying to forget about it but i can't|`|qRKOWgS0aa	l am Madly In Love.........

I know it's hard, but get over it. The best way to get over your heartbreak is to keep yourself busy and to engage in fun and positive activities. Sitting and dwelling on the problem only makes it worse. I've been there myself, it's unfortunate, but keeping yourself busy sure makes a world of difference|`|JyrvQBVgaa	Heyy me too. If it makes you feel better, I got dumped without realizing our relationship was falling apart.. I honestly thought it was going great.. and then he decides to date his gorgeous best friend three days later. It's been 19 days and I'm nowhere close to being over it =(|`|k7588JWLaa	well, i'm in love, but my guy is in Iraq right now.

Then I found someone who help me get back in love and we been happily together for a year and just got recently engaged =]<br>  <br>  Getting over a heartache, is hard and well take plenty of time to heal and if one night...you feel like crying because he broke your heart, get some friends, lots of ice cream/junk and watch movies.  Best cure ( at least, it's for me) =]|`|cIPziIdnaa	I'm in love but my BF keeps breaking my heart - so I guess its both for me!<br>  <br>  I guess what happened I didn't want to fall in love with him but then he started saying "I Love You" first and all that and finally I was like yeah, I guess I love him too... but then after I said it, it seemed liked he got colder or more distant like the thrill of the chase was gone and he is ready to move on....and he doesn't really say he loves me any more instead he says middle of the road stuff like "would I be calling you if I didn't love you?"<br>  <br>  It hurts sometimes honestly, it hurts - especially since I didn't want to even fall in love with him at all, like he made me fall for him!!!|`|vXOreO4Uaa	Not in love or heartbroken<br>  It took me a lot of time. But finally I'm not in love or like someone.<br>  Just focusing in my school..|`|Kz7BsZk6aa	Heartbroken for sure, but still in love...

Zc15R4k5aa	Lawn tickets are behind the seats at most stadiums (I don't know of any where they would be in front, but you never know).  That means that you will be farther away from the stage.  On the lawn you can sit and watch, but you can also stand/dance/etc.  Most people stand in the lawn, but lazy/tired people will sit down for some or all of the show.<br>  <br>  If you get seats, you will more than likely be closer to the stage, and yes, you can stand.

Your computer either doesn't have the requirements to run Netflix smoothly or you are watching movies that are of bad quality. Some movies on Netflix are actually of poor quality when watching them instantly.

XGCHYkwFaa	the movie is about med students playing with death they each go under and die for a certain amount of time each trying to do it longer than the last. while dead they revisit the past winnie is a black girl that kevin bacon and his friends made fun of as kids julia roberts i think her  dad killed her mom or was an abusive drunk and sutherland's character as a kid he and his friends bullied the boy into a tree and the kid fell out and died. the movie starts with sutherland being kicked out of school i believe sorry it has been a long time since i seen this movie although it is a good one

1Ayb4UK7aa	No, walking in and catching my ex-husband orally satisfying another man was enough to prove to me that he was at least bi.   I left him and our divorce was final in less than 3 months.<br>  If I were to suspect my (current and last) husband of cheating, I would come right out and ask him.

No woman would ever want to hear that the man she loves is gay. But when it comes down to it, I guess I would want to know. I'm not sure if I would go as far as hiring someone to spy on him, but i'm sure many women out there would. <br>  <br>  How would I react? I'd be shocked, hurt, and maybe even a little disturbed. It's definitely something to think about.|`|H5eZ1aZAaa	I probabaly would hire someone if I expected my man was gay, and if I found out that he really was, I would beat the blood out of him and take everything he owned.

4c1984f8cb2c48aba420d999ce7ff728aa	You have to decide if your financial situation will allow it, but as far as if the VIP packages are worth it, in my opinion they are.<br>  <br>  I've done I Love All Access for Def Leppard several times and definitely recommend it.  It's a great experience. :)<br>  <br>  Don't expect much from the gifts though... it'll probably just be a tee shirt and some other small souvenir.  Last year it was a picture frame. A few years ago it was a Def Leppard wristband.<br>  <br>  The party is fun, but nothing too special.  They have drinks and snacks, and usually raffle some stuff.  It's pretty cool to talk to other people who love Def Leppard as much as you do. :)<br>  <br>  The main thing you're buying is a guaranteed seat in the first 10 rows.  If you're serious about doing the VIP, make sure you buy them as soon as possible after they go onsale to make sure you're getting the best seat you can.  I've always bought them immediately when the Fan Club presale started, and have always been in the first few rows (front row more than once.)<br>  <br>  It's a really awesome experience. :)|`|d8C5qtS5aa	I wouldn't do it.

We desire a more mature feeling and a well thought out interesting story which anime provides us its not retarded kiddie **** but is based for an older generation which can understand the true meaning. either that or everyone just wants super powers|`|0unqJPehaa	I personally think it's better than a lot of the American stuff, the Anime can be more mature than even the cartoons here aimed at adults.<br>  <br>  I prefer Anime that is mature over America's potty humor animation,  I rarely ever see America come out with animation that is serious and actually has a good story line.<br>  <br>  Same with manga, the stories are really good and just draw you in, most all American comics is just super hero stuff and it gets old, Manga has so many different genres.|`|hgabtLluaa	it's popular everywhere

TWF97qS2aa	Three Little Birds:<br>  I remember hearing this song once, but it didn't become dear to me until after viewing "I Am Legend" on the big screen. I almost broke a tear when Will Smith was singing it (by the way, something to look forward to in that movie [his singing, which indeed was amusing]).<br>  <br>  So, anyways, you can go as deep into the meaning of the song as you want, but everything Bob says in it remains the same. The message, from my point of view, is quite clear. Bob endured the same, less or more, emotions and dramatic events as we do, but always had those "three little birds" to keep his head up. He saw the beauty in things no-one else really does, which reflected on the beauty in him.<br>  <br>  And by the way, philosophically/spiritually speaking, weed is not a drug, but an herb, and way of life. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Could You Be Loved:<br>  This song is another stand-up-for-your-rights to Marley's fellow Jamaican Rasta brothers. This song is addressed to the government or ruling class of Jamaica, the people who suppressed Marley's brothers during the time this song was written. He's telling them that God will judge you based on how you treat us, and "could you be loved?" and "say something" are ways of asking them to change their ways. Bobmarley.com gives good background information relating to the themes of Marley's songs.<br>  <br>  I love the whole "Could you be loved?" thing; what everyone's saying about its meaning is totally perfect, and so sadly true. It has special meaning in my life.. but you don't want to hear about *that*.<br>  <br>  The part I love most about the song is the way Marley drops in his verses. "We've got a mind of our own/ So go to hell if what you're thinkin' isn't right/Love would never leave us alone/ In the darkness there must come out to light" And everything else. Again, even though he's talking about something totally different, this stuff could apply to almost *anything.*

gfmTgLDKaa	This is the TV show:<br>  Mary Higgins Clark's Loves Music, Loves to Dance<br>  Program Synopsis:<br>  Darcy Scott, producing a documentary on people who date through the personals, talks her best friend Erin into answering some of the ads in order to gather information on the topic for an upcoming television show. But Erin is murdered at the hands of one of the dates -- a serial killer who places dance shoes on each of his victims. Darcy feels responsible, and even though a detective cautions her not to get involved, she begins going out with the same men Erin dated in an attempt to trap the killer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Movie:<br>  This was a book written by Mary Higgins Clark and it is called Loves Music, Loves to Dance. It was adapted to a TV series and then in to a movie I believe.

AA11727780	First, with the Genres you're playing, learn how to fingerbar properly,  its not a flat finger its on its side<br>  <br>  Second, Slouching will make it hard to form some chords so sit up<br>  <br>  Third, when you play a note, the closer it is to the fret, the less force it takes to push on it and the clearer the sound, therefore your fingers won't get tired.<br>  <br>  Lastly, for now, practice quick chord formations by making the chord, dropping your entire hand, and reforming it on the way up again.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and enjoy, the guitar is a sick instrument, I'd know|`|OtUozt5raa	You should go to <a href="http://discoverguitaronline.com" rel="nofollow">http://discoverguitaronline.com</a> and look for scales and use those as warm-ups.

Start with easy stuff like Smoke on the water i would avoid the solo at first|`|1640VigBaa	What I did when I started playing guitar was print out tabs for the songs i wanted to play really bad and worked through them. The ones I just couldn't manage to pull off, i would set aside and come back to them in a couple weeks. For me the process was trial and error, but I got threw it just fine. As for the habits to stay away from, don't worry to much about them right now, because there is nothing you can really do about them until you get better at guitar. I would also buy a sight reading book to learn how to read notes, because they have some nice melodies they have you play. I honestly think the best thing to do is just keep printing out tabs and playing them. If you want some challenging stuff, start playing guns n' roses tabs and other rock from that time period. Good luck!|`|nsnyGZOtaa	your hand will stretch as you play... you have to play with your fingerTIPS!!! when i started i played the intros to come as you are - nirvana and hells bells - ac/dc and then i learned how to play kryptonite and some easy powerchord songs like rock you like a hurricane and slow ride and t.n.t.|`|mDeyha01aa	First, get in the habit of using ALL your fingers not just your pointer and middle finger.

Kurt Cobain or Eric Clapton i think would be close behind as well.<br>  Best Technique - Kirk Hammet, Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads (my favorite), or maybe John Petrucci (he has no feeling whatsoever though)<br>  Best Knowledge of theory - Randy Rhoads or Michael Angel Batio<br>  Most Innovative - Tom Morello or Jimi Hendrix or Jimmy Paige.  Jack White  and Dimebag are close up top there too.<br>  I don't really know too much about blues, but i would have to say i think that Stevie Ray Vaughan and B.B.

And then rescued by another. Now 10 years later, Yuki Cross, the adopted daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy, has grown up and become a guardian of the vampire race, protecting her savior, Kaname, from discovery as he leads a group of vampires at the elite boarding school. But also at her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend who’s hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear, is now determined never to trust them. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Nightbreed (1990)<br>  starring Craig Sheffer, Anne Bobby, David Cronenberg, Charles Haid, Hugh Quarshie, Kim Robertson, Hugh Ross, Doug Bradley<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  A community of mutant outcasts of varying types and abilities attempts to escape the attentions of a psychotic serial killer and redneck vigilantes with the help of a brooding young man who discovers them. The film is based on the novel "Cabal" by Clive Barker, who wrote the story and screenplay and directed the film.<br>  IMDb review:<br>  Boone is a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer. The cops gun him down in front of Midian, on the surface a cemetery but actually a haven for monsters who have been shunned by society. When they lay claim to Boone and make him one of their own, this causes repercussions for everybody, including Boone's sweet girlfriend and dubious psychiatrist.<br>  Here's the movie trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MntiEGXQFk&NR=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MntiEGXQ...</a><br>  Here's Part 1 on YouTube:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSyGVRY1CPo&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSyGVRY1C...</a><br>  <br>  You described it well enough that I'm fairly certain this is your movie. The cemetery is Midian, and there is a whole civilization of creatures/monsters beneath it. Most people remember the woman with the quills and the woman who turns into smoke.

2bVxBCgzaa	Mesa is always my choice- Callahan might want to check his power tube section or something; my Dual Rectum-Fryer was good for the five years I had it, never one problem. They sound fantastic at low volume- that's what the gain stages are for! And you can use the 'spongy' switch to drop the power.<br>  You might also look at the Mesa Stiletto Ace- read these reviews::<br>  <a href="http://mesaboogie.com/Reviews/2007MP-Stiletto/MP-STILETTO2x12Fin-07.html" rel="nofollow">http://mesaboogie.com/Reviews/2007MP-Sti...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.guitarworld.com/article/mesa_boogie_stiletto_ace_1x12_combo" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarworld.com/article/mesa_...</a><br>  it would be my choice if I wasn't looking for a Road King combo.<br>  Here's a YouTube demo someone made:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXkXnHeSwRM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXkXnHeSw...</a><br>  <br>  Bogner makes great amps, nothing wrong with them- I'd just say play through a few amps, and make your call.

You wont have to upgrade your amp almost ever, and you can concentrate on a guitar upgrade down the road.  Look at a Mesa Boogie Express too.|`|fzqMOD4Waa	Well, a guitar player who I work with quite a bit, just had his Mesa pretty much sh*t itself after only a year. It seems to have lost a chunk of it's power for no reason. Not say that Mesas are crap, cause I know they're not, I'm just a little uneasy about them after knowing his troubles.<br>  <br>  I own one of the Bogner designed Line 6 Spider Valve and I love it. I don't know a lot about Bogner's own amps, but if the Spider Valve is anything to go by, it would be a good bet.

AA11264713	NC-17 and X rated are used for pornography movies and really violent movies. <br>  <br>  Most hollywood movies fall under the category G, PG, PG-13, and R. General with PG-13 a under 13 can get into the movie with a parent. An R rated movie a person under 17 can get into the movie as long as someone who is 17 or older pays for the ticket.<br>  <br>  NC-17 means if you are under 17 you can't get in what so ever. Hollywood tends to make movies so that they can have a larger target audience.

1559a5f6090a45ecb3e44ea35fc2c37baa	I would say that the new Switchfoot is better, because Nothing Is Sound is my favorite album, but it really isn't that different.  In the end it really is the same band, and their music really hasn't changed significantlly just because they are on a bigger label.  In fact, Oh! Gravity sounds more like their older stuff then the 2 albums that came before it...|`|cJnoNkVraa	I love Switchfoot. That's it. I don't think either the "old" or "new" Switchfoot is better. They're older stuff is way cool, and they're new stuff is just more rockish and up to date I think. Either way it's great music!|`|3a1b108e931b26c5db8ec8c380d63e0aaa	ohmiosh...i aore switchfoot. i am a die hard fan.

1af9c110f29a5ad7c253773cd58cf982aa	It's because your eyes are designed to be constantly changing where they are looking.  When you walk around outside you are constantly changing the focal length you have your eyes adjusted to.<br>  <br>  With a monitor you are constantly focused on the screen which is a set distance away.  This is very abnormal for your eyes.  When you leave the computer it takes quite a while for your eyes to begin focusing normally again.<br>  <br>  It is recommended that whenever possible you  sit by a window so that you can periodically (about every 5 mins) look around outside and dramatically change the focal length your eyes are using.<br>  <br>  It's very good advice.|`|X8ajB2P2aa	Or maybe because you're staring at a light bulb for hours on end.<br>  <br>  According to research, you blink much less when focused on an object.

Mlwd5Bt3aa	Bob Marley died from a malignant melanoma, a form of cancer, that was on his right toe.  He could've avoided death with amputation, but it was against his Rastafari beliefs.  The cancer spread. <br>  <br>  "Bob Marley played his final concert at the Stanley Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 23, 1980. The live version of "Redemption Song" on Songs of Freedom was recorded at this show.  Marley afterwards sought medical help from Munich specialist Josef Issels, but his cancer had already progressed to the terminal stage.  While flying home from Germany to Jamaica for his final days, Marley became ill, and landed in Miami for immediate medical attention.

My GGF, which stands for good guy friend, doesn't seem all that annoyed yet he's just to the contrary, a bit annoyed.  This is something I've got to stop, along with the fact that I'm not even close to being a true girly girl!  No way.  That's something I could never fulfill, I mean, I don't even go to Beauty & Style anymore.

PswM1viIaa	No soy muy telenovelófila (jajaja esa palabra no existe, o eso espero), pero actualmente siento que ya no hay buenas tramas ni actores. Les siento a todos super forzados en sus papeles y es que parece que ya cualquiera escribe telenovelas y por qué, porque siempre trata de lo mismo:<br>  "La pobre chica pobre que se enamora del chico rico inalcanzable, que tiene una novia guapísima pero supuestamente mala (mala porque se cabrea cuando una tonta quiere quitarle al novio, porque si fuera buena se dejaría quitar al novio) y como no está muy enamorado de ella, pues se enamora de las dos. Pasa el tiempo. Deja a la mala, se hace novio de la tonta-pobre hasta que la madre de ella descubre que son hermanos por parte de padre (ya que en sus tiempos mozos, la madre fue un poco ligerilla de cascos y se acostó con el padre de el chico rico-inalcanzable) y decide separarles. <br>  Se separan y la tonta-pobre se ve forzada a enamorarse de otro pobre, pero llevando en su vientre ?oh no! un hijo del chico rico-inalcanzable!!!! (porque en las telenovelas, cuando el chico rico inalcanzable se acuesta con la pobre-tonta, o el preservativo se rompe o ella es super fértil y él tiene un super semen fecundador)  y el chico rico, al verse  abandonado por la pobre-tonta, se cabrea y se casa con la guapa-mala. él no quiere tener hijos con la guapa-mala, o quiere pero ella no es fértil o el super semen fecundador ya no fecunda. Pasa el tiempo, sigue enamorado de la pobre-tonta y ella, la pobre-tonta, sigue enamorada de él. La guapa-mala les descubre y sabe que ella tiene un hijo de él, así que por venganza, le roba al ni?o (que cómo le roba al ni?o? Pues fácil, como la pobre tonta es tan tonta no mira a ambos lados de la calle al cruzar y la atropella un coche que va conducido por alguien a quien la guapa-mala a contratado y la pobre tonta queda inconsciente y allí le roba al ni?o. O en el hospital, hace un cambio de bebés. Le ponen un cabbage patch kid a la pobre tonta que no se da cuenta que el mu?eco no es su hijo). Pasan los a?os y la pobre-tonta, ya no es tan pobre ni tan tonta y siempre tiene recuerdos de que tenía un hijo o algo por el estilo así que va donde una bruja (siempre hay una bruja en la telenovela para poder explicar las cosas raras que pasan y que no pueden respaldarse con lógica. Y claro, la bruja SIEMPRE ES NEGRA) que le confirma que tuvo un hijo. Así que esta ahora viene (siempre les cortan el pelo y les cambian un poco la ropa) a vengarse de la guapa-mala. Y ahora sí, la pobre-tonta ya tiene derecho a matar, a pegar, a enga?ar... y al final, la guapa-mala o muere o queda desfigurada o en un manicomio y la pobre-tonta, encuentra a su hijo y vive feliz con el rico-inalcanzable." <br>  <br>  Al final, concluyo, ?quién es el que sale favorecido en toda la telenovela? El chico rico inalcanzable ?por qué? Porque se acuesta con todas, tiene hijos con todas las que quiere, siempre es rico y su mayor preocupación es "uy, las acciones han bajado", "estoy enamorado de dos a la misma vez y las dos quieren estar conmigo"...<br>  <br>  A que has leído esto y concuerda con más de 20 telenovelas  que has visto?

Este estilo se impuso en las películas de los a?os '50 y se convirtió en una clásico, aunque no es muy frecuente entre las parejas sigue siendo muy romático.<br>  <br>  El beso succionador: para practicarlo, la mujer tiene que tomar entre sus labios el labio inferior de su pareja para introducirlo en su boca, mientras que él ejerce una movimiento de succión.<br>  <br>  Beso francés o de lengüita:consiste en que la mujer toque con su lengua los labios del hombre para luego intrducirla en la boca de su pareja y viceversa. <br>  <br>  El beso de lado:se realiza cuando cada uno de los miembros de la pareja gira su cabeza en sentidos opuestos para besarse. <br>  <br>  El beso de apretón:se refiere cuando una persona aprieta fuertemente sus labios contra el labio inferior de su pareja.<br>  <br>  El beso de tú uno y yo el otro:se trata de que el hombre bese el labio superior de la mujer mientras que ella besa el labio inferior de él.<br>  <br>  El beso toma todo: un miembro de la pareja toma entre sus labios los labios del otro. <br>  <br>  El beso de lengua apasionado: La pareja introduce sus respectiva lengua en la boca del contrario tocando los dientes al paladar. <br>  <br>  El beso de yo te sigo: en este caso se espera a que uno de los dos inicie la acción de besar y el otro le siga alcanzando un ritmo frenético. <br>  <br>  El beso cazador: este se da cuando la pareja juega a que cada uno trata de atrapar con sus labios el labio inferior del otro.|`|rtOUUZq3aa	Beso<br>   <br>  Beso entre dos novios<br>  El beso es el acto de tocar algo con los labios, generalmente a otra persona.

SUS OBRAS EXITOSAS FUERON: NANá, LUCRECIA BORGIA, UNA DAMA SIN CAMELIAS, YOCASTA, A CALZON AMARRADO Y LAS EMMANUELLE. ROMPIERON RECORDS DE ENTRADO EN SUS DOS FUNCIONES DIARIAS. PERO NANá FUE LA OBRA QUE LA HIZO MULTIMILLNARIA, AUNQUE NO LO CREAN. TODAS LAS NOCHES SACABAN COSTALES REPLETOS DE BILLETES Y SE LO LLEVABAN A SU CASA DEL PEDREGAL, QUE EN ESE TIEMPO VIVIA Y DISFURTABA DE LA FAMA, SE LA PASABAN CONTANDO EL DINERO HASTA EL AMANECER, ASU FUE TODO LOS DIAS, DURENTE CINCO A?OS QUE STUVO EN CARTELERA DE ESTA CONTROVERTIDA OBRA DE EMILIO ZOLá.

EbGydNtMaa	Pues,  en el primer capítulo de la segunda temproada. Aquí te lo copio y pego:<br>  <br>  EPISODIO 1: VóRTICE <br>  Clark rescata a Lana del centro de la tormenta en lo que será su primer contacto con su poder para volar, y se da cuenta de que la misma tormenta ha enterrado a su padre en un viejo búnker junto al reportero sin escrúpulos que ha descubierto su secreto. Mientras tanto, Lex se ve abrumado por los cargos sobre su padre, y en medio de la destrucción sembrada durante el tornado, Lionell se ve atrapado bajo los escombros, y Lex duda entre salvarle la vida o dejarle morir; finalmente le salva, pero Lionell queda ciego. Por otro lado, Chloe deja a Clark puesto que se considera menos importante para él que Lana, y no desea vivir un enga?o, aunque a él sólo le dice que es mejor ser amigos. Finalmente Clark encuentra a su padre y el reportero, pero la kryptonita que hay en refugio le deja sin fuerzas y el reportero está apunto de asesinar a Jonathan. Pero en ese momento Lex aparece y le dispara, en una oportuna mezcla de ayudar a sus amigos y de conservar en secreto su relación con el reportero. <br>  <br>  De todas formas, aquí está la guia con resúmen de TODOS los capítulos:<br>  <a href="http://www.seriesdetv.com/foros/viewtopic.php?t=7081" rel="nofollow">http://www.seriesdetv.com/foros/viewtopi...</a><br>  <br>  Saludos ;)|`|6tDpdQTnaa	la piede en la primera temporada penultimo capitulo porke en el tornado pero solo en un lapso de tiempo despues el finge starlo para darse cuenta de ke su hijo lo detesta y que la demas gente lo repudia<br>  suerte|`|FgqRXcELaa	te iba a escribir lo mismo que José Antonio y se me adelanto.|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	es a corto plazo y luego finge pero es dscubierto tambin es descubierto lucas el <br>  supuesto  hermano "muerto" de lex

e6a68e49d6ea91c878bb913071c1db28aa	Calentamiento global<br>  De Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre<br>  Saltar a navegación, búsqueda<br>      <br>  Gráfico de la concentración de dióxido de carbono en la atmósfera terrestre (azul) y la temperatura media global (rojo), en los últimos 1000 a?os.Calentamiento global es un término utilizado habitualmente en dos sentidos:<br>  <br>  Es el fenómeno observado en las medidas de la temperatura que muestra en promedio un aumento en la temperatura de la atmósfera terrestre y de los océanos en las últimas décadas. <br>  Es una teoría que predice, a partir de proyecciones basadas en simulaciones computacionales, un crecimiento futuro de las temperaturas. <br>  La denominación "calentamiento global" suele llevar implícita las consideraciones de la influencia de las actividades humanas. Esta variante antropogénica de la teoría predice que esto sucederá si continúan las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. La opinión científica mayoritaria sobre el cambio del clima dice que "la mayor parte del calentamiento observado en los últimos 50 a?os, es atribuible a la actividad humana"[1]. Las simulaciones parecen indicar que la principal causa del componente de calor inducido por los humanos se debería al aumento de dióxido de carbono. La temperatura del planeta ha venido elevándose desde finales del siglo XIX, cuando se puso fin a la etapa conocida como la peque?a edad de hielo.<br>  <br>   <br>  Predicciones basadas en diferentes modelos del incremento de la temperatura media global respecto de su valor en el a?o 2000.Algunas veces se utiliza la denominación cambio climático, que designa a cualquier cambio en el clima, sin entrar en discusiones sobre su causa. Para indicar la existencia de influencia humana se utiliza el término cambio climático antropogénico.<br>  <br>  Calentamiento global y efecto invernadero no son sinónimos. El efecto invernadero acrecentado por la contaminación puede ser, según las teorías, la causa del calentamiento global observado.<br>  <br>  Aunque la discusión se centra en la temperatura, el calentamiento global o cualquier tipo de cambio climático implica cambios en otras variables: las lluvias globales y sus patrones, la cobertura de nubes y todos los demás elementos del sistema atmosférico. La complejidad del problema y sus múltiples interacciones hacen que la única manera objetiva de evaluar simultáneamente estos cambios sea a través del uso de modelos computacionales que intentan simular la física de la atmósfera y del océano y que tienen una precisión muy limitada debido al desconocimiento actual del funcionamiento de la atmósfera.<br>  <br>  El cuerpo multigubernamental y científico encargado de su análisis global es el Panel Intergubernamental del Cambio Climático (IPCC, por sus siglas en inglés de Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change). Una de las consecuencias más notables de su trabajo es el Protocolo de Kyoto, que promueve una reducción de emisiones contaminantes (principalmente gases de efecto invernadero) por parte de los países industrializados. El protocolo ha sido tachado de injusto, al considerar asociadas el incremento de las emisiones al desarrollo, con lo que las naciones más afectadas serán aquellas menos desarrolladas. La previsión del protocolo es que, si todos los paises más contaminantes lo firmaran, se conseguiría una reducción de la temperatura media del aire en el planeta de 0.07 oC.<br>  <br>  Tabla de contenidos [ocultar]<br>  1 Registros de temperatura <br>  2 Teorías y objeciones <br>  3 Teorías que intentan explicar los cambios de temperatura <br>  3.1 Teoría de los gases invernadero <br>  3.2 Teoría de la variación solar <br>  3.3 Otras hipótesis <br>  4 El calentamiento global en el pasado <br>  5 Modelos climáticos <br>  6 Datos de Interés del Calentamiento Global <br>  6.1 Datos del IPCC en su 3er Informe de 2001 <br>  7 Efectos potenciales <br>  8 La relación entre el calentamiento global y la reducción de ozono <br>  9 Soluciones domésticas para reducir la emisión de CO2 <br>  10 Véase también <br>  11 Referencias <br>  12 Enlaces externos <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Registros de temperatura<br>   <br>  Temperatura media terrestre en el período 1900 - 2004.El período sobre el que el calentamiento puede observarse varía según el enfoque. En ocasiones desde la Revolución Industrial, otras desde el comienzo de un registro histórico global de temperatura alrededor de 1860; o sobre el siglo XX, o los 50 a?os más recientes.<br>  <br>  Es de rese?ar que muchos gráficos empleados para mostrar el calentamiento empiezan en 1970, cuando comienza a subir de nuevo la temperatura después de 36 a?os de descenso medio, a pesar de que durante esos a?os hubo un aumento de emisión de gases de efecto invernadero. La década más calurosa del pasado siglo XX fue precisamente la de los a?os 30.<br>  <br>  En los últimos 20.000 a?os el suceso más importante es el final de la Edad de Hielo, hace aproximadamente 12.000 a?os [2]. Desde entonces, la temperatura ha permanecido relativamente estable, aunque con varias fluctuaciones como, por ejemplo, el Período de Enfriamiento Medieval o Peque?a Edad del Hielo. Durante el siglo XX la temperatura se incrementó en aproximadamente 0,4 a 0,8 oC.<br>  <br>  Véase también: Registro de la temperatura en el siglo XX, evolución de temperatura de los últimos 1000 a?os, y cambio climático antropogénico<br>  Las temperaturas en la troposfera inferior se han incrementado entre 0,08 y 0,22 oC por decenio desde 1979. El aumento de la temperatura no sigue una ley lineal, sino que presenta fluctuaciones debidas a la variabilidad natural, siendo la más notable de ellas el fenómeno de El Ni?o. Durante el mismo periodo las temperaturas en la superficie terrestre muestran un incremento de aproximadamente 0,15 oC por decenio [3].<br>  <br>  Véase también: Mediciones de temperatura por satélite<br>  <br>  Teorías y objeciones<br>  El debate ha sobrepasado el ámbito científico y ha llegado al debate público. Algunos políticos llegan a convertirlo en tema de sus campa?as electorales, como Al Gore (autor de Earth in the Balance ("La Tierra en juego")).<br>  <br>  Muchas de las teorías del calentamiento global son motivo de controversia. Existe un debate social y político sobre la cuestión de si existe consenso científico suficiente para justificar una acción internacional concertada para aminorar sus efectos.<br>  <br>  Los defensores de la teoría del calentamiento global por causas antropogénicas expresan una amplia gama de opiniones, aunque la posición mayoritaria es la defendida por el IPCC, que culpa a la actividad industrial y pide la disminución de emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero[1].<br>  <br>  Algunos científicos simplemente reconocen como datos observables los incrementos de temperatura.<br>  <br>  Otros apoyan medidas como el Protocolo de Kyoto, que intentan tener cierto efecto sobre el clima futuro y llevar a cabo otras medidas posteriormente. Estos piensan que el da?o medioambiental tendrá un impacto tan serio que deben darse pasos inmediatamente para reducir las emisiones de CO2, a pesar de los costos económicos para las naciones. Por ejemplo Estados Unidos, que produce mayores emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero que cualquier otro país, en términos absolutos, y es el segundo mayor emisor per cápita después de Australia.<br>  <br>  Los economistas también han alertado de los efectos desastrosos que tendrá el cambio climático sobre la economía mundial con reducciones de hasta un 20% en el crecimiento, cuando las medidas para evitarlo no sobrepasarían el 1% [2]. Los da?os económicos predichos provendrían principalmente del efecto de las catástrofes naturales, con cuantiosas pérdidas de vidas humanas, por ejemplo en Europa [3].<br>  <br>  También existen científicos y autores ecoescépticos, como Bj?rn Lomborg, que ponen en duda el calentamiento global, basándose en los mismos datos usados por los defensores del calentamiento global. Estos defienden que no están demostradas las teorías que predicen el incremento futuro de las temperaturas, argumentando que las diferencias del índice de calentamiento en el próximo siglo entre los diferentes modelos informáticos es de más del 400% (a pesar de que en esta horquilla de variación siempre se recogen aumentos significativos). Estos científicos han sido acusados de estar financiados por consorcios petroleros [4] o presionados por sus fuentes de financiación públicas como el gobierno de los EEUU [5]. Pero el mismo argumento puede utilizarse para los científicos que defienden la postura contraria financiados por los grupos de presión ecologistas.<br>  <br>  <br>  Teorías que intentan explicar los cambios de temperatura<br>  El clima varía por procesos naturales tanto internos como externos. Entre los primeros destacan las emisiones volcánicas, y otras fuentes de gases de efecto invernadero (como por ejemplo el metano emitido en las granjas animales). Entre los segundos pueden citarse los cambios en la órbita de la Tierra alrededor del Sol (Teoría de Milankovitch) y la propia actividad solar.<br>  <br>  Véase también: Cambio climático<br>  Los especialistas en climatología aceptan que la Tierra se ha calentado recientemente (El IPCC cita un incremento de 0.6 ± 0.2 °C en el siglo XX). Más controvertida es la posible explicación de lo que puede haber causado este cambio. Tampoco nadie discute que la concentración de gases invernadero ha aumentado y que la causa de este aumento es probablemente la actividad industrial durante los últimos 200 a?os.<br>  <br>  Véase también: Atribuciones del reciente cambio climático<br>  También existen diferencias llamativas entre las mediciones realizadas en las estaciones meteorológicas situadas en tierra (con registros en raras ocasiones comenzados desde finales del siglo XIX y en menos ocasiones todavía de una forma continuada) y las medidas de temperaturas realizadas con satélites desde el espacio (todas comenzadas a partir de la segunda mitad del siglo XX). Estas diferencias se han achacado a los modelos utilizados en las predicciones del aumento de temperatura existente en el entorno de las propias estaciones meteorológicas debido al desarrollo urbano (el efecto llamado Isla de calor). Dependiendo del aumento predicho por estos modelos las temperaturas observadas por estas estaciones serán mayores o menores (en muchas ocasiones incluso prediciendo disminuciones de las temperaturas).<br>  <br>  Véase también: Medidas de las temperaturas<br>  <br>  Teoría de los gases invernadero<br>   <br>  Concentración de dióxido de carbono en los últimos 417.000 a?os. La parte roja indica la variación a partir de 1800.La hipótesis de que los incrementos o descensos en concentraciones de gases de efecto invernadero pueden dar lugar a una temperatura global mayor o menor fue postulada extensamente por primera vez a finales del s. XIX por Svante Arrhenius, como un intento de explicar las eras glaciales. Sus coetáneos rechazaron radicalmente su teoría.<br>  <br>  La teoría de que las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero están contribuyendo al calentamiento de la atmósfera terrestre ha ganado muchos adeptos y algunos oponentes en la comunidad científica durante el último cuarto de siglo. El IPCC, que se fundó para evaluar los riesgos de los cambios climáticos inducidos por los seres humanos, atribuye la mayor parte del calentamiento reciente a las actividades humanas. La Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Estados Unidos (National Academy of Sciences, NAC) también respaldó esa teoría. El físico atmosférico Richard Lindzen y otros escépticos se oponen a aspectos parciales de la teoría.<br>  <br>  Hay muchos aspectos sutiles en esta cuestión. Los científicos atmosféricos saben que el hecho de a?adir dióxido de carbono CO2 a la atmósfera, sin efectuar otros cambios, tenderá a hacer más cálida la superficie del planeta. Pero hay una cantidad importante de vapor de agua (humedad, nubes) en la atmósfera terrestre, y el agua es un gas de efecto invernadero. Si la adición de CO2 a la atmósfera aumenta levemente la temperatura, se espera que más vapor de agua se evapore desde la superficie de los océanos. El vapor de agua así liberado a la atmósfera aumenta a su vez el efecto invernadero (El vapor de agua es un gas de invernadero más eficiente que el CO2. A este proceso se le conoce como la retroalimentación del vapor de agua (water vapor feedback en inglés). Es esta retroalimentación la causante de la mayor parte del calentamiento que los modelos de la atmósfera predicen que ocurrirá durante las próximas décadas. La cantidad de vapor de agua así como su distribución vertical son claves en el cálculo de esta retroalimentación. Los procesos que controlan la cantidad de vapor en la atmósfera son complejos de modelar y aquí radica gran parte de la incertidumbre sobre el calentamiento global.<br>  <br>  El papel de las nubes es también crítico. Las nubes tienen efectos contradictorios en el clima. Cualquier persona ha notado que la temperatura cae cuando pasa una nube en un día soleado de verano, que de otro modo sería más caluroso. Es decir: las nubes enfrían la superficie reflejando la luz del Sol de nuevo al espacio. Pero también se sabe que las noches claras de invierno tienden a ser más frías que las noches con el cielo cubierto. Esto se debe a que las nubes también devuelven algo de calor a la superficie de la Tierra. Si el CO2 cambia la cantidad y distribución de las nubes podría tener efectos complejos y variados en el clima y una mayor evaporación de los océanos contribuiría también a la formación de una mayor cantidad de nubes.<br>  <br>  A la vista de esto, no es correcto imaginar que existe un debate entre los que "defienden" y los que "se oponen" a la teoría de que la adición de CO2 a la atmósfera terrestre dará como resultado que las temperaturas terrestres promedio serán más altas. Más bien, el debate se centra sobre lo que serán los efectos netos de la adición de CO2, y en si los cambios en vapor de agua, nubes y demás podrán compensar y anular este efecto de calentamiento. El calentamiento observado en la Tierra durante los últimos 50 a?os parece estar en oposición con la teoría de los escépticos de que los mecanismos de autorregulación del clima compensarán el calentamiento debido al CO2.<br>  <br>  Los científicos han estudiado también este tema con modelos computarizados del clima. Estos modelos se aceptan por la comunidad científica como válidos solamente cuando han demostrado poder simular variaciones climáticas conocidas, como la diferencia entre el verano y el invierno, la Oscilación del Atlántico Norte o El Ni?o. Se ha encontrado universalmente que aquellos modelos climáticos que pasan estos tests también predicen siempre que el efecto neto de la adición de CO2 será un clima más cálido en el futuro, incluso teniendo en cuenta todos los cambios en el contenido de vapor de agua y en las nubes. Sin embargo, la magnitud de este calentamiento predicho varía según el modelo, lo cual probablemente refleja las diferencias en el modo en que los diferentes modelos representan las nubes y los procesos en que el vapor de agua es redistribuido en la atmósfera.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, las predicciones obtenidas con estos modelos no necesariamente tienen que cumplirse en el futuro. Los ecoescépticos responden que las predicciones contienen exageradas oscilaciones de más de un 400% entre ellas, que hace que las conclusiones sean inválidas, contradictorias o absurdas. Los ecólogos responden que los escépticos no han sido capaces de producir un modelo de clima que no prediga que las temperaturas se elevarán en el futuro. Los escépticos discuten la validez de los modelos teóricos basados en sistemas de ecuaciones diferenciales, que son sin embargo un recurso común en todas las áreas de la investigación de problemas complejos difíciles de reducir a pocas variables, cuya incertidumbre es alta siempre por la simplificación de la realidad que el modelo implica y por la componente caótica de los fenómenos implicados. Los modelos evolucionan poniendo a prueba su relación con la realidad prediciendo (retrodiciendo) evoluciones ya acaecidas y, gracias a la creciente potencia de los ordenadores, aumentando la resolución espacial y temporal, puesto que trabajan calculando los cambios que afectan a peque?as parcelas de la atmósfera en intervalos de tiempo discretos.<br>  <br>  Las industrias que utilizan el carbón como fuente de energía, los tubos de escape de los automóviles, las chimeneas de las fábricas y otros subproductos gaseosos procedentes de la actividad humana contribuyen con cerca de 22.000 millones de toneladas de dióxido de carbono (correspondientes a 6.000 millones de toneladas de carbón puro) y otros gases de efecto invernadero a la atmósfera terrestre cada a?o. La concentración atmosférica de CO2 se ha incrementado hasta un 31% por encima de los niveles pre-industriales, desde 1750. Esta concentración es considerablemente más alta que en cualquier momento de los últimos 420.000 a?os, el período del cual han podido obtenerse datos fiables a partir de núcleos de hielo. Se cree, a raíz de una evidencia geológica menos directa, que los valores de CO2 estuvieron a esta altura por última vez hace 40 millones de a?os. Alrededor de tres cuartos de las emisiones antropogénicas de CO2 a la atmósfera durante los últimos 20 a?os se deben al uso de combustibles fósiles. El resto es predominantemente debido a usos agropecuarios, en especial deforestación [4].<br>  <br>  Los gases de efecto invernadero toman su nombre del hecho de que no dejan salir al espacio la energía que emite la Tierra, en forma de radiación infrarroja, cuando se calienta con la radiación procedente del Sol, que es el mismo efecto que producen los vidrios de un invernadero de jardinería. Aunque éstos se calientan principalmente al evitar el escape de calor por convección.<br>  <br>  El efecto invernadero natural que suaviza el clima de la Tierra no es cuestión que se incluya en el debate sobre el calentamiento global. Sin este efecto invernadero natural las temperaturas caerían aproximadamente 30 oC. Los océanos podrían congelarse, y la vida, tal como la conocemos, sería imposible. Para que este efecto se produzca, son necesarios estos gases de efecto invernadero, pero en proporciones adecuadas. Lo que preocupa a los climatólogos es que una elevación de esa proporción producirá un aumento de la temperatura debido al calor atrapado en la baja atmósfera.<br>  <br>  Los incrementos de CO2 medidos desde 1958 en Mauna Loa muestran una concentración que se incrementa a una tasa de cerca de 1.5 ppm por a?o. De hecho, resulta evidente que el incremento es más rápido de lo que sería un incremento lineal. El 21 de marzo del 2004 se informó de que la concentración alcanzó 376 ppm (partes por millón). Los registros del Polo Sur muestran un crecimiento similar al ser el CO2 un gas que se mezcla de manera homogénea en la atmósfera.<br>  <br>  <br>  Teoría de la variación solar<br>  Se han propuesto varias hipótesis para relacionar las variaciones de la temperatura terrestre con variaciones de la actividad solar. La comunidad meteorológica ha respondido con escepticismo, en parte, porque las teorías de esta naturaleza han sufrido idas y venidas durante el curso del siglo XX [5].<br>  <br>  Sami Solanki, director del Instituto Max Planck para la Investigación del Sistema Solar, en G?ttingen (Alemania), ha dicho [6]:<br>  <br>  El Sol está en su punto álgido de actividad durante los últimos 60 a?os, y puede estar ahora afectando a las temperaturas globales. (...) Las dos cosas: el Sol más brillante y unos niveles más elevados de los así llamados "gases de efecto invernadero", han contribuido al cambio de la temperatura de la Tierra, pero es imposible decir cuál de los dos tiene una incidencia mayor.<br>  <br>  Willie Soon y Sallie Baliunas del Observatorio de Harvard correlacionaron recuentos históricos de manchas solares con variaciones de temperatura. Observaron que cuando ha habido menos manchas solares, la Tierra se ha enfriado (Ver Mínimo de Maunder y Peque?a Edad de Hielo) y que cuando ha habido más manchas solares, la Tierra se ha calentado, aunque, ya que el número de manchas solares solamente comenzó a estudiarse a partir de 1700, el enlace con el período cálido medieval es, como mucho, una especulación.<br>  <br>  Véase también: Período Cálido Medieval<br>  Las teorías han defendido normalmente uno de los siguientes tipos:<br>  <br>  Los cambios en la radiación solar afectan directamente al clima. Esto es considerado en general improbable, ya que estas variaciones parecen ser peque?as. <br>  Las variaciones en el componente ultravioleta tienen un efecto. El componente UV varía más que el total. <br>  Efectos mediados por cambios en los rayos cósmicos (que son afectados por el viento solar, el cual es afectado por el flujo solar), tales como cambios en la cobertura de nubes. <br>  Aunque pueden encontrarse a menudo correlaciones, el mecanismo existente tras esas correlaciones es materia de especulación. Muchas de estas explicaciones especulativas han salido mal paradas del paso del tiempo, y en un artículo "Actividad solar y clima terrestre, un análisis de algunas pretendidas correlaciones" (Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, 2003 p801–812) Peter Laut demuestra que hay inexactitudes en algunas de las más populares, notablemente en las de Svensmark y Lassen (ver más abajo).<br>  <br>   <br>  Variaciones en el ciclo solar.En 1991 Knud Lassen, del Instituto Meteorológico de Dinamarca, en Copenhague, y su colega Eigil Friis-Christensen, encontraron una importante correlación entre la duración del ciclo solar y los cambios de temperatura en el Hemisferio Norte. Inicialmente utilizaron mediciones de temperaturas y recuentos de manchas solares desde 1861 hasta 1989, pero posteriormente encontraron que los registros del clima de cuatro siglos atrás apoyaban sus hallazgos. Esta relación aparentemente explicaba, de modo aproximado, el 80% de los cambios en las mediciones de temperatura durante ese período. Sallie Baliuna, un astrónomo del Centro Harvard-Smithsoniano para la astrofísica (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), se encuentra entre los que apoyan la teoría de que los cambios en el Sol "pueden ser responsables de los cambios climáticos mayores en la Tierra durante los últimos 300 a?os, incluyendo parte de la reciente ola de calentamiento global".<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, el 6 de mayo de 2000 la revista New Scientist informó que Lassen y el astrofísico Peter Thejil habían actualizado la investigación de Lassen de 1991 y habían encontrado que, a pesar de que los ciclos solares son responsables de cerca de la mitad de la elevación de temperatura desde 1900, no logran explicar una elevación de 0,4 oC desde 1980:<br>  <br>  Las curvas divergen a partir de 1980 y se trata de una desviación sorprendentemente grande. Algo más está actuando sobre el clima. [...] Tiene las ?huellas digitales? del efecto invernadero.<br>  <br>  Posteriormente, en el mismo a?o, Peter Stoff y otros investigadores de Centro Hadley, en el Reino Unido, publicaron un artículo en el que dieron a conocer el modelo de simulación hasta la fecha más exhaustivo sobre el clima del Siglo XX. Su estudio prestó atención tanto a los agentes forzadores naturales (variaciones solares y emisiones volcánicas) como al forzamiento antropogénico (gases invernadero y aerosoles de sulfato). Al igual que Lassen y Thejil, encontraron que los factores naturales daban explicación al calentamiento gradual hasta aproximadamente 1960, seguido posteriormente de un retorno a las temperaturas de finales del siglo XIX, lo cual era consistente con los cambios graduales en el forzamiento solar a lo largo del siglo XX y la actividad volcánica durante las últimas décadas.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, estos factores no podían explicar por sí solos el calentamiento en las últimas décadas. De forma similar, el forzamiento antropogénico, por sí solo, era insuficiente para explicar el calentamiento entre 1910-1945, pero era necesario para simular el calentamiento desde 1976. El equipo de Stott encontró que combinando todos estos factores se podía obtener una simulación cercana a la realidad de los cambios de temperatura globales a lo largo del siglo XX. Predijeron que las emisiones continuadas de gases invernadero podían causar incrementos de temperatura adicionales en el futuro "a un ritmo similar al observado en las décadas recientes" [7].<br>  <br>  <br>  Otras hipótesis<br>  Se han propuesto otras hipótesis en el ámbito científico:<br>  <br>  El incremento en temperatura actual es predecible a partir de la teoría de las Variaciones orbitales, según la cual, los cambios graduales en la órbita terrestre alrededor del Sol y los cambios en la inclinación axial de la Tierra afectan a la cantidad de energía solar que llega a la Tierra. <br>  El calentamiento se encuentra dentro de los límites de variación natural y no necesita otra explicación particular.[8] <br>  El calentamiento es una consecuencia del proceso de salida de un periodo frío previo, la Peque?a Edad de Hielo y no requiere otra explicación. <br>  Algunos escépticos argumentan que la tendencia al calentamiento no está dentro de los márgenes de lo que es posible observar (dificultad de generar un promedio de la temperatura terrestre para todo el globo debido a la ausencia de estaciones meteorológicas, especialmente en el océano, sensibilidad de los instrumentos a cambios de unas pocas decenas de grados celsius), y que por lo tanto no requiere de una explicación a través del efecto invernadero.<br>  <br>  <br>  El calentamiento global en el pasado<br>  Los geólogos creen que la Tierra experimentó un calentamiento global durante el Jurásico inferior con elevaciones medias de temperatura que llegaron a 5 oC. Las investigaciones efectuadas por la Universidad Abierta [9] publicadas en la revista Geology (n.o 32, pág. 157–160, 2004 [10] indican que esto fue la causa de que se acelerase la erosión de las rocas hasta en un 400%, un proceso en el que tardaron 150.000 a?os en volver los valores de dióxido de carbono a niveles normales. Posteriormente se produjo también otro episodio de calentamiento global conocido como Máximo termal del Paleoceno-Eoceno [11].<br>  <br>  <br>  Modelos climáticos<br>  Los modelos climáticos más recientes dan una buena simulación de los cambios globales de temperatura en el siglo XX. La simulaciones climáticas no atribuyen inequívocamente el calentamiento que ocurrió desde 1910 hasta 1945 a variaciones naturales o a forzamientos antropogénicos. Todos los modelos muestran que el calentamiento habido entre 1975 y 2000 es en gran medida antropogénico. Estas conclusiones dependen de la exactitud de los modelos utilizados y de la correcta estimación de los factores externos.<br>  <br>  La mayoría de los científicos están de acuerdo en que hay procesos climáticos importantes que están incorrectamente explicados en los modelos climáticos, pero no piensan que otros modelos mejores puedan cambiar la conclusión sober el origen del calentamiento global actual (fuente IPCC).<br>  <br>  Los críticos puntualizan que hay defectos y factores externos no especificados que no se han tenido en consideración, y que podrían cambiar la conclusión del IPCC. Algunos críticos no identificados dicen que las simulaciones climáticas son incapaces de acomodar los mecanismos de autorregulación del vapor de agua ni de manejar nubes. Algunos efectos solares indirectos pueden ser muy importantes y no han sido explicados por los modelos (fuente The Skeptical Environmentalist.<br>  <br>  El IPCC en Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2001, p774: "En la investigación y la creación de modelos climáticos, debemos reconocer que nos enfrentamos con un sistema caótico no lineal, y por lo tanto las predicciones a largo plazo de los estados climáticos futuros no son posibles".<br>  <br>  Véase también: modelo climático<br>  <br>  Datos de Interés del Calentamiento Global<br>  Según un artículo publicado en enero del 2004, el calentamiento global podría exterminar a una cuarta parte de todas las especies de plantas y animales de la Tierra para el 2050... especies conocidas... y generar otra cuarta parte de especies nuevas además de mejorar la productividad de algunos cultivos en latitudes altas y medias. <br>  Estudios realizados, muestran que la década de los noventa, fue la más caliente en los últimos mil a?os. <br>  En caso de que todo el hielo que forma el Inlandsis antártico se fundiera, el nivel del mar aumentaría aproximadamente 61 m; un aumento de sólo 6 m bastaría para inundar a Londres y a Nueva York. <br>  En nivel del Dióxido de Carbono (CO2) en la atmósfera podría duplicarse en los próximo 30 o 50 a?os. <br>  Los países más afectados son los principales en promover la reducción de emisión de los gases invernadero <br>  En 1984 el tama?o del hueco en la capa de ozono sobre la Antártida era aproximadamente 7 millones de km2, hoy mayor a los 29 millones de km2 (cuatro veces mayor). <br>  La aceleración del flujo del hielo en regiones de Groenlandia se estimó en 2000 que disminuye el volumen de su inlandsis en 51 km3/a?o [12], aunque una revaluación más reciente [13]sitúa el número en 150 km3/a?o. Parte del aumento se debe a una aceleración reciente de la fusión de los glaciares periféricos, y se estima que su contribución al aumento del nivel del mar ha alcanzado en 2005 un valor 0,57 ± 0.1 mm/a?o. <br>  Indonesia es el país con mayor número de mamíferos y pájaros en peligro de extinción, 128 y 104 respectivamente. <br>  En Estados Unidos se recupera sólo el 11% de los residuos sólidos producidos, y en Europa Occidental es del 30%. <br>  Brasil fue entre 1990 y 2000 el país en el que hubo mayor deforestación con 22.264 km2 <br>  Cinco de los 10 países que más deforestan se encuentran en el continente africano. <br>  <br>  Datos del IPCC en su 3er Informe de 2001<br>  En relación a esta afirmación:<br>  <br>  "Estudios realizados, muestran que la década de los noventa, fue la más caliente en los últimos mil a?os"<br>  <br>  , el IPCC dice exactamente:<br>  <br>  A escala mundial, es muy probable(66-90%) que el decenio del 1990 fuera el más cálido desde que se dispone de registros instrumentales.<br>  <br>  <br>  IPCC#Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report<br>  El IPCC afirma exactamente en Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report que: <br>  Se proyecta que los glaciares y las capas de hielo continúen su retirada generalizada durante el siglo XXI.

Se han observado ciertos procesos y se los ha relacionado con el calentamiento global. La disminución de la capa de nieve, la elevación del nivel de los mares y los cambios meteorológicos son consecuencias del calentamiento global que pueden influir en las actividades humanas y en los ecosistemas. Algunas especies pueden ser forzadas a emigrar de sus habitats para evitar su extinción debido a las condiciones cambiantes, mientras otras especies pueden extenderse. Pocas de las ecorregiones terrestres pueden esperar no resultar afectadas.<br>  <br>   <br>  Elevación del nivel de los mares, medido en 23 estaciones fijas, entre 1900 y 2000.Otro motivo de gran preocupación para algunos es la elevación del nivel de los mares. Los niveles de los mares se están elevando entre 1 y 2 centímetros por decenio, y algunas naciones isle?as del Océano Pacífico, como Tuvalu, están trabajando en los detalles de su esperada eventual evacuación. El calentamiento global da lugar a elevaciones del nivel marino debido a que el agua de los mares se expande cuando se calienta, además de que se produce un aumento de la cantidad de agua líquida procedente del adelgazamiento de los casquetes polares, del hielo marino y de la reducción de los glaciares. En palabras del TAR del IPCC:<br>  <br>  Se prevé que el nivel medio global del mar se elevará entre 9 y 99 cm entre 1990 y 2100. [...] y en caso de que todo el hielo de la Antártida se derritiera, el nivel del mar aumentaria 125 m.<br>  <br>  Con un aumento de solo 6 m, bastaría para inundar Londres y Nueva York. Esto es debido primariamente a la expansión térmica y a la pérdida de masa de los glaciares y casquetes polares.<br>  <br>  Conforme el clima se haga más cálido la evaporación se incrementará. Esto causará un aumento de las precipitaciones lluviosas y más erosión. Mucha gente piensa que esto podría resultar en un tiempo meteorológico más extremo conforme progrese el calentamiento global. El TAR del IPCC dice:<br>  <br>  Se prevé que la concentración global de vapor de agua y las precipitaciones se incrementarán durante el siglo XXI. Para la segunda mitad del siglo XXI es probable que las precipitaciones se hayan incrementado en las latitudes medio-altas y en la Antártida en invierno. En las bajas latitudes habrán tanto incrementos como decrecimientos regionales según diferentes áreas. En la mayoría de las áreas serán probables variaciones interanuales y se espera un incremento en las precipitaciones.<br>  <br>  El calentamiento global tendría otros efectos menos evidentes. La corriente del Atlántico norte, por ejemplo, es debida a cambios de temperatura. Parece ser que, conforme el clima se hace más cálido, esta corriente está disminuyendo, y esto quiere decir que áreas como Escandinavia y Gran Breta?a, que son calentadas por esta corriente, podrían presentar un clima más frío, en lugar del calentamiento general global.<br>  <br>  Hoy se teme que el calentamiento global sea capaz de desencadenar los cambios bruscos masivos de temperatura. La corriente del Atlántico Norte data de la época del deshielo de la última glaciación (hace 14.000 a?os). Hace 11.000 a?os esa corriente sufrió una interrupción que duró 1.000 a?os. Esto provocó la peque?a glaciación conocida como Joven Dryas —el nombre de una flor salvaje alpina— que duró 900 a?os en el noroeste de Norteamérica y el norte de Europa. (Ver la discusión sobre la teoría del caos para ideas relacionadas.)<br>  <br>  El calentamiento global modificará la distribución de la fauna y floras del planeta. Ello conllevará la extensión de enfermadades de las que algunos de estos animales son portadores. Tal es el caso de la malaria, el dengue o la fiebre amarilla, cuyos vectores son ciertas especies de mosquitos que habitan principalmente en zonas tropicales.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, el calentamiento global también puede tener efectos positivos, ya que las mayores temperaturas y mayores concentraciones de CO2 pueden mejorar la productividad de los ecosistemas. Los datos aportados por satélites muestran que la productividad del Hemisferio Norte se ha incrementado desde 1982. Por otro lado, un incremento en la cantidad total de la biomasa producida no es necesariamente del todo bueno, ya que puede disminuir la biodiversidad aunque florezcan un peque?o número de especies. Similarmente, desde el punto de vista de la economía humana, un incremento en la biomasa total pero un descenso en las cosechas podría ser una desventaja. Además, los modelos del IPCC predicen que unas concentraciones mayores de CO2 podrían simplemente espolear la flora hasta un punto, ya que en muchas regiones los factores limitantes son el agua y los nutrientes, no la temperatura o el CO2; tras ese punto, incluso aunque los efectos invernadero y del calentamiento continuasen, podría no haber ningún incremento compensatorio en crecimiento.<br>  <br>  Otro punto posible de discusión está en cómo incidirían los efectos del calentamiento global en el equilibrio económico humano norte-sur. Si produciría un aumento de la desertización de los países áridos y semiáridos a?adido a un clima más benigno en los países fríos o si el efecto sería diferente.<br>  <br>  <br>  La relación entre el calentamiento global y la reducción de ozono<br>  Aunque se menciona frecuentemente en la prensa popular una relación entre el calentamiento global y la reducción de ozono, esta conexión no es fuerte. Existen tres áreas de enlace:<br>  <br>  El calentamiento global producido por el forzamiento radiativo por CO2 se espera que enfríe (quizás sorprendentemente) la estratosfera. Esto, a cambio, podría darnos lugar a un incremento relativo en la reducción de ozono, y en la frecuencia de agujeros de ozono. <br>  Véase también: Reducción de ozono y agujero de ozono<br>  A la inversa, la reducción de ozono representa un forzamiento radiativo del sistema climático. Hay dos efectos opuestos: La reducción de la cantidad de ozono permite la penetración de una mayor cantidad de radiación solar, la cual calienta la troposfera. Pero una estratosfera más fría emite menos radiaciones de onda larga, tendiendo a enfriar la troposfera. En general, el enfriamiento predomina. El IPCC concluye que las pérdidas estratosféricas de ozono durante las dos décadas pasadas han causado un forzamiento negativo del sistema de la superficie troposférica. <br>  Una de las predicciones más sólidas de la teoría del calentamiento global es que la estratosfera debería enfriarse. Sin embargo, y aunque este hecho ha sido observado, es difícil atribuirlo al calentamiento global (por ejemplo, el calentamiento inducido por el incremento de radiación solar podría no tener este efecto de enfriamiento superior), debido a que un enfriamiento similar es causado por la reducción de ozono. <br>  <br>  Soluciones domésticas para reducir la emisión de CO2<br>  Cambiar las bombillas tradicionales por las compactas fluorescentes ( CFL). Las CFL, consumen 60% menos electricidad que una bombilla tradicional, con lo que este simple cambio reducirá la emisión de 140 kilos de dióxido de carbono al a?o. <br>  Poner el termostato con dos grados menos en invierno y dos grados más en verano. Ajustando la calefacción y el aire acondicionado se podrían ahorrar unos 900 kilos de dióxido de carbono al a?o. <br>  Usar menos agua caliente. Se puede usar menos agua caliente instalando una ducha-telefono de baja presion y lavando la ropa con agua fría o tibia. <br>  Utilizar un colgador en vez de la secadora de ropa. Si se seca la ropa al aire libre la mitad del a?o, se reduce en 320 kilos la emisión de dióxido de carbono al a?o. <br>  Comprar productos de papel reciclado. La fabricación de papel reciclado consume entre 70% y 90% menos energía y evita que continúe la deforestación mundial. <br>  Comprar alimentos frescos. Producir comida congelada consume 10 veces más energía. <br>  Evitar comprar productos envasados. Si se reduce en un 10% la basura personal se puede ahorrar 540 kilos de dióxido de carbono al a?o. <br>  Reciclar, se pueden ahorrar hasta 1000 kilos de residuos en un a?o reciclando la mitad de los residuos de una familia. <br>  Elegir un vehículo de menor consumo. Un vehículo nuevo puede ahorrar 1.360 kilos de dióxido de carbono al a?o si este rinde dos kilómetros más por litro de combustible (lo mejor sería comprar un vehículo híbrido o con biocombustible) <br>  Usar menos el vehículo. Caminar, ir en bicicleta, compartir el vehículo y usar el transporte público. Reducir el uso del vehículo propio en 15 kilómetros semanales evita emitir 230 kilos de dióxido de carbono al a?o. <br>  Revisar frecuentemente los neumáticos. Una presión correcta de los neumáticos mejora la tasa de consumo de combustible en hasta un 3%. Cada litro de gasolina ahorrado evita la emisión de tres kilos de dióxido de carbono. <br>  Plantar árboles. Una hectárea de árboles, elimina a lo largo de un a?o, la misma cantidad de dióxido de carbono que producen cuatro familias en ese mismo tiempo. Un solo árbol elimina una tonelada de dióxido de carbono a lo largo de su vida.|`|aoZu56nraa	es como un manto que se hace en la atmofera,haciendo que los rayos del sol ingresen a la tierra y no puedan salir,esto hace que agan en invierno o primavera esos dias de calor,esto lo producen las industrias,que largan monoxido de carbono.<br>   lo unico que se puede hacer es cerrar las fabricas,juntar firmas de por lo menos 2 millones de personas,que esten de acuerdo en cerrarlas.|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	es el calentamiento de las placas de la tierra y derretimiento de polos y hoyo en capa de ozono<br>  <br>  se origino por la contaminacion exesiva y se hizo un hueco en la capa de ozono en 1832 me parece<br>  <br>  se combate no usando sprays y algunos desodorantes algunos dicen no contaminar la capa de ozono pero quien sabe tambien por los deshechos en los rios y mares que ocacionan la lluvia acida .

Perform in Kariokie (sp) clubs. If you have an intrumentalist who can back up vocals, then try out coffee houses. Being 12, it'll be harder b/c you can't go to bars and clubs. Just get out there. Some scouting agent is sure to be around. You can also send in recordings to different recording agencies. But be warned...you WILL be rejected. Everyone has their own opinion on who is good and who isn't (before the Beetles became populor, they were told they were no good). And besides, parents and friends will always tell you you sound good whether you do or not. Harsh, but true. How many years of experiance do you have? That will also help. Now get out there and have fun. Good Luck!

4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	ah, I don't think it will ever happen.  Hollywood is an industry that is always changing and being progressive in new ideas.  I would imagine that we could see a season of more conservative films (think Christmas and family time) but we are not likely to see an entire movement.  Personally I appreciate the movies that just challenge me to think differantly and rarely worry if it is a certain viewpoint.  Alas if we don't feel something for it (even negative) what was the point of going to see it in the first place.|`|AA10796061	These days will seem conservative compared to what is to come.

Tan llena de nostalgia, poesía y un humor muy especial. Es genial!!!<br>  <br>  "sus diálogos están basados en los poemas de Mario Benedetti, Oliverio Girondo y Juan Gelman, los protagonistas los recitan incluso a veces sin recitarlos, hablando tras el humo de un cigarro, tras la barra de un burdel, en el metro o sobre una cama que expulsa al infinito a las mujeres que no saben volar."<br>  <br>  la película comienza así:<br>  <br>  ”Me importa un pito que las mujeres tengan los senos como magnolias o como pasas de higo; un cutis de durazno o de papel de lija. Le doy una importancia igual a cero al hecho de que amanezcan con un aliento afrodisíaco o insecticida. Soy perfectamente capaz de soportarles una nariz que sacaría el primer premio en una exposición de zanahorias.

Following a long illness and home care, it was recommended to place her in a hospice so others could visit her before her passing. Everyone who came also left within 10 to 15 minutes of their arrival. My wife, myself, my children , nieces and nephew all decided to stay and read the bible to her. Her favorite book in it was Ephesians, about putting on your armor and picking up all of Gods protection. Following singing and reading the entire Ephesian all of the  kids fell asleep. My wife and I stood up comforting her to have her vitals rising and she becoming alert, looked at my wife and then she saw me there smiled and passed away. It was something that felt amazing and was a honor for ourselves to be a part of. I can never erase that memory of that day, because it was the first time in about 11 year since her eyes were charcoal black and alert.

Aunque la mayor parte de la programación de VH1 es "FRESOTA" y tiene programas y reallity shows bastante estúpidos (la vida surrealista por ejemplo) a veces nos sorprende con videos, entrevistas y películas que valen la pena. De MTV no quiero decir lo que pienso por que tendría que usar palabras demasiado fuertes, es una verdadera mier..., sobre todo su estupidísimo reallity "Next". Aún así de vez en cuando le echo un ojo para estar al día en cuanto a lo nuevo en música. ?ya me pase de royo! ahí nos vemos. Ciao!!!|`|9y1PDZ33aa	Los tres están super padres pero prefiero VH1 por que los vídeos se ven mas originales y pasan de todo a y también me encanta la fabulosa vida d esta super padre su programasion no cabe duda.|`|KCMRU7jwaa	aguante mtv y much music son los mejores|`|LSbBMSTFaa	claro q vh1.. mtv y telehit estan mui vendidos|`|XNO2hQS2aa	A mi tambien me gusta VH1 porque es juvenil pero se mantiene fiel al pasado con los clasicos,sin embargo he de decir Mtv porque es con el que he crecido y si bien ha cambiado de igual manera lo hemos hecho nosotros.|`|ab77517e8066f2266bda714d418485daaa	Definitivamente VH1|`|f4b414cc8b0d2434390c8fdd682a9e5faa	VH1 me gusta mucho más porque tienes razón pasan música del rock clásico pero ademas pasan películas muy buenas y he visto muy buenos documentales de grupos de rock|`|q2NdU40Saa	pues mtv y un poco de telehit|`|6ab5d34a8ec16c723905360182778887aa	A mi gusto los dos mejores son VH1 y Telehit. Me gusta VH1 pero no pasan mucha música actual y para eso esta padre Telehit (aunq yo creia q era = de aburrido q MTV)<br>  pero tiene 2 que 3 programas interesantes con diversas temáticas (de cine, debates), tiene música en espa?ol e inglés y no sólo programas de ligue como MTV. Los clasicazos y una que otra peli en VH1!|`|SeFPkt2yaa	Ninguno. Por que ya no valen la pena. Son canales 100% Reality Shows. Antes podias ver y escuchar musica las 24 horas. Ahora ves media hora de musica y lo demas son Reality Shows. Que por cierto algunos son demasiado chafas. Ya se olvidaron de programas como Headbangers, caricaturas tales como Beavis and Butthead's. Eso es en MtV y VH1. Y por parte de Telehit, programas como El calabozo mantenian al margen de la televsion a la juventud de ese tiempo. Asi que MTV y VH1 junto con Telehit! BASURA!|`|W3M31yGraa	en ultimo lugar dejaria a telehit xk no me gusta la calidad de se?al, en segundo creo a vh1, pero algo k me gusta es lo k mencionas k ponen de todo tipo de musica y los realitys son buenos, pero para mis gustos es mejor mtv, xk pasan mas programas y no tan repetidos como en vh1.|`|e38rJW3Uaa	VH1!! <br>  Me encantan los rankings que pasan los sábados, y también VH1 Clásicos...<br>  Saludos!!

Sandman was like that, even some of the regular DC stories are like that.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's worth waiting for the collected edition to come out and read the story cover-to-cover, straight through.<br>  <br>  You might even find that if you were reading it by the issue, you may have missed something that you will see in the collected edition.<br>  <br>  The collected edition should be available in any Good comics shop. I know, because I bought my collected edition of "Batman: City of Crime" from a comic shop.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

El Sol es una enana amarilla: <br>  El Sol es una estrella ubicada dentro de una galaxia que contiene otras 400.000 millones de estrellas más. Este gran conjunto estelar es la galaxia de La Vía Láctea. <br>  <br>  La Vía Láctea es una galaxia espiral, en forma de disco, en el cual las estrellas se van desplazando alrededor de la zona central. Sus dimensiones son enormes: la luz tarda 100.000 a?os en recorrer el diámetro del disco. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  El sol es una estrella típica de la población que forma el disco de nuestra galaxia, la Vía Láctea. Su posición es cercana al plano ecuatorial de ésta, a una distancia de unos 10 Kiloparsecs (*) de su núcleo, sobre el borde interno de uno de sus brazos espirales. <br>  <br>  El Sol es una estrella peque?a, de color amarillento; su temperatura exterior ha sido estimada en unos 5.800 oK, con una edad aproximada que se estima en 4.600 millones de a?os. Posee un sistema planetario, el Sistema Solar, y en la clasificación estelar se le han dado las siglas G2V. <br>  <br>  El estudio del Sol ha tenido siempre particular interés, tanto por la importancia capital que desempe?a en la vida terrestre como, desde el punto de vista astronómico, por ser la única estrella directamente observable, pieza básica para la comprobación de muchas teorías estelares. <br>  <br>   <br>  Fotografía del Sol, tomada desde el Observatorio de Yebes (Guadalajara), con filtro Ha y óptica 150 mm Carl Zeiss Jena<br>  <br>  La zona visible desde la posición en la que nos encontramos, a 150.000.000 de kms del Sol, es una peque?a , peque?ísima parte de la Vía Láctea. El conglomerado estelar de nuestra galaxia se observa de perfil, de canto, puesto que el Sol se encuentra en el mismo plano ecuatorial de la galaxia. <br>  <br>  La observación directa desde el lugar que ocupa el Sol y su sistema planetario, nos muestra cómo el centro galáctico queda en la dirección que se conoce como Constelación de Sagittario. <br>  <br>   <br>  La galaxia, vista desde la posición que ocupamos, se observa de perfil. La zona más intensa cae dentro de la constelación de Saggitario. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [Regresar al principio]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. El Sol también se mueve: <br>  <br>  a) Movimiento traslacional: <br>  <br>  El Sol está sometido, junto con el grupo local de estrellas próximas, a un movimiento de traslación alrededor del centro de la galaxia, a una velocidad de 216 kms/segundo, velocidad que exige 230 millones de a?os para una órbita completa. <br>  <br>  El movimiento del Sol en el espacio sólo puede ser evidenciado respecto a algún punto de referencia. El movimiento propio del Sol respecto a la estrella más cercana es de unos 19’4 kms/segundo, hacia un punto situado en la constelación de Hércules, que se acostumbra a denominar Apex. <br>  <br>   <br>  230 millones de a?os para dar una vuelta alrededor del centro de la galaxia.<br>  <br>  b) Movimiento rotacional: <br>  <br>  Además el Sol experimenta una rotación sobre sí mismo en un tiempo próximo a los 25 días, alrededor de un eje inclinado unos 7o 11’ con respecto a la eclíptica. Esta rotación no se efectúa uniformemente para todos los puntos del globo solar, sino que es tanto menos rápida cuanto más se aleja el punto del ecuador, fenómeno que se conoce como rotación diferencial. El periodo de rotación exacto es de 24’9 días en la zona ecuatorial, y de 25’2 días a 15o de latitud, sea esta Norte o Sur del globo solar, y es de 34 días en los polos. <br>  <br>   <br>  Gira alrededor de un eje Norte-Sur solar. <br>  <br>   <br>  Todos los puntos de la superficie no tienen la misma velocidad <br>  <br>   <br>  La zona ecuatorial solar va mas deprisa<br>  <br>  c) Pulsaciones en el Sol: <br>  <br>  Se sabe también que el sol es una estrella pulsante, con un periodo de 2 horas 40 minutos y una velocidad de expansión de 3 metros/segundo    <br>  <br>  <br>  Estas imágenes muestran gráficamente las vibraciones del Sol. El Sol sabemos que vibra, aunque no se sabe muy bien el porqué lo hace. El Soho, proyecto conjunto entre norteamericanos y europeos, ha observado las vibraciones del Sol. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [Regresar al principio]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  3. Las características básicas del Sol: <br>  <br>  La magnitud aparente del Sol, para un observador terrestre es de -26'7. Es la magnitud más grande que observamos. <br>  <br>  La magnitud absoluta del Sol, esto es, la magnitud que aparenta tener para un observador situado a 10 parsecs de distancia (32'6 a?os luz) es de 4'86, es decir, apenas seria visible a simple vista. Para poder comparar, pensemos que la estrella Aldebarán (alfa-Tauro), que está a 68 a?os luz de nosotros, la vemos con una magnitud aparente de 1'1. Su magnitud absoluta es de -0'49. <br>  <br>  Para obtener la magnitud absoluta a partir de la magnitud aparente basta aplicar la fórmula: <br>  <br>  Mabsol = Mapar + 5 - 5 . log(d)<br>  <br>  Donde d es la distancia a la cual se observa con magnitud aparente Mapr, medida en parsecs. <br>  <br>   <br>  La magnitud absoluta es de solo 4.86<br>  Las veces que una estrella es más brillante que el Sol se puede calcular con la fórmula <br>  <br>  <br>  En el caso de Aldebarán, se tiene: <br>  <br>  <br>  Es decir, Aldebarán es una estrella 138 veces mas luminosa que el Sol. <br>  <br>  Para que nos hagamos idea de mediciones de luminosidad, pensemos en estos datos: <br>  <br>  Magnitud visual de la Luna (cuando está en fase de luna llena):................... -12 <br>  Magnitud visual de la estrella Sirio (es la estrella mas brillante):................... -1.44 <br>  Magnitud visual del planeta Venus (el lucero de Alba):................................. -4.0 <br>  <br>  El Sol se encuentra en la zona media del Diagrama de Herszprung-Russell, que, como se sabe, permite representar los tipos estelares tomando en ordenadas la magnitud absoluta y en horizontales la temperatura superficial del astro. El Sol aparece, pues, en el centro de la serie principal del diagrama, es decir, es una estrella del tipo espectral G 2VI, con 4600 a?os de existencia, y aproximadamente los mismos de espectativa de vida estable. <br>  <br>   <br>  El Sol se encuentra en el centro de la serie principal del diagrama<br>  El radio lineal del Sol (distancia desde el centro a la capa superficial) es de aproximadamente 696000 kms. (el radio lineal de la Tierra es de 6378 kms. Esto es, si la Tierra fuera una pelota de radio 6’37 cms, el sol seria una esfera de 6’96 metros de radio, situada a 1500 metros ) <br>  <br>  El volumen correspondiente a este radio es de 1’41 x 1027 metros cúbicos. (El volúmen de la Tierra es de 1’7039531 x 1014 metros cúbicos) <br>  <br>  La masa total del astro solar es 2 x 10 30 Kgs. (La masa de la Tierra es de 5,98x1024 Kgs). <br>  <br>  Esto da una densidad media de 1’41 g/cm3 . (densidad de la Tierra: 5’52 g/cm3). <br>  <br>  La aceleración de la fuerza de la gravedad en la superficie del Sol es de 274 m/s2 . (la aceleración de la fuerza de la gravedad en la superficie de nuestro planeta es de 9’81 m/s2 ). <br>  <br>  Esto quiere decir que una persona que pese 80 kilos en la superficie de la Tierra, si pudiera encontrarse en la superficie del Sol tendría un peso de 2237 kilos. <br>  <br>   <br>  Comparando características del Sol con la Tierra<br>  <br>  Analizando las lineas del espectro de la luz solar, pueden identificarse fácilmente los elementos que están preesentes en nuestra estrella. <br>  <br>   <br>  La espectroscopia permite determinar elementos existentes en el Sol<br>  <br>  La composición química del Sol resulta, según esto, ser la misma que la de otros objetos cósmicos (exceptuando la Tierra y otros planetas). El contenido medio es el siguiente: elemento No relativo de átomos <br>  Hidrógeno 1.000.000 <br>  Helio 100.000 <br>  Oxígeno 1.000 <br>  Carbono 400 <br>  Neón 200 <br>  Nitrógeno 100 <br>  Silicio 60 <br>  Azufre 20 <br>  Magenesio 20 <br>  Hierro 6 <br>  Sodio 2 <br>  Aluminio 2 <br>  Argón 2 <br>  Calcio 2 <br>  <br>  <br>  El hidrógeno es, por tanto, el elemento que prevalece en el Sol. Por el número de átomos su cantidad es, aproximadamente, diez veces mayor que la de todos los demás elementos, perteneciéndole casi el 70% de la masa del Sol (el hidrógeno es el elemento más ligero). <br>  <br>  Por su contenido, el helio es el segundo elemento: ocupa casi el 29% de la masa del Sol. A todos los restantes elementos, tomados conjuntamente, le corresponden algo más de un 1%. En ciertos casos es importante conocer el contenido de elementos que tienen determinadas propiedades. Así, por ejemplo, la cantidad total de átomos de los metales en la atmósfera del Sol es casi 10000 veces menor que la de átomos de hidrógeno. <br>  <br>   <br>  Elementos que aparacen en la composición del Sol <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [Regresar al principio]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  4. ?Cuidad la forma de observar el Sol!. <br>  <br>  La observación directa del Sol entra?a un serio peligro si no se hace en las debidas condiciones y usando material debidamente homologado. Las lesiones que puede producir en la retina son irreversibles, esto es, nos puede dejar completamente ciegos. <br>  <br>  La observación del Sol, por otra parte, es necesaria y conveniente para mantener el conocimiento del estado de la actividad del astro: conocer el numero de manchas y su evolución diaria, los gránulos y supergránulos, las espículas, las protuberancias y fulguraciones, etc., así como la observación en ocasión de un eclipse. <br>  <br>  Hay que actuar, en el proceso de observación, con una serie de recomendaciones de seguridad por delante: <br>  <br>  Recomendación fundamental: <br>  <br>  ?No mirar nunca directamente, a ojo pelado, al Sol, y mucho menos usando telescopios, prismáticos o cualquier sistema óptico que no esté debidamente protegido con filtros homologados, ya que aumentan la cantidad de energía luminica que recibe el ojo!.<br>  Peligro: ?QUEDARSE CIEGO! . <br>  Recomendaciones básicas: <br>  <br>  a)Gafas especiales homologadas: del tipo de las que se venden en algunos planetarios como el de Madrid, o el Museo de la Ciencia, de Granada. <br>  <br>   <br>  Se recuerda a los posibles usuarios que durante el ultimo eclipse total de Sol, de 11 de agosto de 1999, alguna revista de tirada nacional regalaba, al vender el numero de julio, unas gafas para ver el eclipse, supuestamente homologadas. Al descubrirse que tales gafas no eran adecuadas, se ordenó, por vía judicial, retirar la revista de los kioscos y lugares de venta.<br>  <br>  No son adecuadas, por supuestos, las gafas oscuras corrientemente comercializadas en las tiendas. <br>  <br>  b) Filtros: <br>  <br>  El filtro perfectamente adecuado para observación solar es el filtro de soldador de densidad 14. <br>  <br>  También es necesario advertir que no sirven otros tipos de cristales para filtrar la luz solar (por ejemplo, no son adecuados los vidrios ahumados, ni las radiografías de médicos usadas, ni los cristales oscurecidos por cualquier medio que no estén debidamente preparados para el objetivo único de la observación del Sol) <br>  <br>   <br>  Hay que tener cuidado con la utilización de filtros <br>   <br>  No valen cristales ahumados, ni trozos de radiografías usadas, etc..<br>  <br>  c) Láminas especiales ( Mylar, etc.) para uso en la boca del telescopio, o prismáticos. <br>  <br>   <br>  Las láminas deben ser de adecuada calidad<br>  Estas láminas especialmente preparadas para que reflejen la radiación infrarroja, se venden en las tiendas especializadas en artículos y dispositivos para uso en Astronomía. <br>  <br>   <br>  Hay ciertos filtros que ofrecen gastante seguridad<br>    <br>  <br>  Se adaptan perfectamente a la boca del telescopio o prismáticos.<br>  d) La más segura manera de observar el Sol: <br>  <br>  La forma de observación que ofrece mayor seguridad al observador consiste en la proyección sobre una pantalla de papel u de otro material adecuado, de la imagen que aparece a través del ocular, evitando , de este modo, mirar a través del ocular, ya que solo hemos de mirar la pantalla con la imagen proyectada. De esta manera se evita la exposición de nuestra retina al peligro de la radiación solar. <br>  <br>  Existen dispositivos caseros de sujeción de una peque?a pantalla a una distancia fija del ocular del telescopio para agilizar la visualización del disco solar proyectado en la misma. Estos dispositivos son las llamadas Pistolas Solares. <br>  <br>   <br>  Proyectando sobre una pantalla la luz que pasa a travez de las lentes <br>   <br>  Las pistolas solares se pueden hacer de forma artesanal, y no ofrecen peligro, pues no se observa al Sol directamente. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [Regresar al principio]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  5. El interior del Sol: <br>  <br>  Para el estudio de su constitución física, el Sol se puede dividir en tres grandes zonas: <br>  <br>  Parte Interna, Fotosfera y Atmósfera. <br>   <br>  En este corte se observan las tres partes estructurales de la esfera solar<br>  <br>  La parte interna y la fotosfera es lo que denominamos la esfera solar, que tiene alrededor de 696.000 kms de radio en total. La fotosfera, en realidad, es una delgada capa de solo unos 500 kms de espesor. <br>  <br>  La Parte Interna (Núcleo, zona de radiación y zona de convección): <br>  <br>  La parte interna no es, evidentemente, accesible a la observación directa; para su conocimiento es preciso integrar gradualmente las ecuaciones de la hidrostática y de la termodinámica desde la superficie hasta el centro, imponiendo los parámetros precisos para que, a cada profundidad, exista un equilibrio entre presiones, radiaciones y pesos y para que el resultado final esté de acuerdo con los datos obtenidos por las técnicas de la Astronomía. <br>  <br>  La energía que el Sol emite proviene de la fusión nuclear del hidrógeno, reacción que tiene lugar precisamente en la parte interna, que alcanza una temperatura de 15 millones de grados y una presión que llega a los cien mil millones de atmósferas, con un peso específico que se cree está entre 50 y 115 g/cm3. La fusión del hidrógeno tiene lugar fusionando cuatro núcleos de Hidrógeno para formar 2 núcleos de Helio, emitiendo la energía correspondiente en forma de radiación gamma. <br>  <br>  Se calcula que en la parte interna del Sol se fusionan 700 millones de toneladas de hidrógeno cada segundo, y la pérdida de masa, que se transforma en energía solar, se cifra en 4’3 millones de toneladas por segundo. A este ritmo, el Sol necesitará más de 6000 millones de a?os para consumir el 10% del hidrógeno que posee. <br>  <br>  La parte interna se compone del núcleo, de unos 200.000 kms de radio, de la zona de radiación, que tiene un espesor de casi los 300.000 kms, y de la zona convectiva, con unos 200.000 kms de espesor. <br>  <br>  La Fotosfera: <br>  <br>  La fotosfera envuelve la parte interna del Sol. Deslumbrante y uniforme a simple vista, presenta al telescopio una textura compleja; es una importante esfera gaseosa incandescente, que absorbe casi totalmente la radiación que emite la parte interna, lo que la mantiene a una temperatura prácticamente constante de 5800 oK. <br>  <br>  La fotosfera es la superficie visible del Sol, y a su parte exterior se refieren las medidas dimensionales del mismo; posee una característica granulación brillante, los llamados “granos de arroz”, y es donde pueden observarse las manchas solares, que corresponden a zonas de temperatura algo inferior (unos 1000 oK menos, y que se muestran oscuras por contraste). <br>  <br>  Su espesor es de alrededor de los 500 kms. <br>  <br>  En total, la parte interna y la fotosfera constituyen la esfera solar, de unos 696.000 kms de radio. <br>  <br>  La Atmósfera: <br>  <br>  Envolviendo a la fotosfera se encuentra la Atmósfera solar, en la que se distinguen dos zonas distintas: la cromosfera y la corona. <br>  <br>  La cromosfera se extiende encima de la fotosfera en un espesor de varios miles de kilómetros (unos 10.000 kms). Su densidad varia desde 10-8 g/cm3 en la base hasta 10-15 g/cm3 en la parte superior; esta densidad tan peque?a la hace prácticamente transparente a los rayos de luz, las radiaciones que emite representan solamente milésimas de la radiación solar total. Hasta la invención del espectroscopio solo se la podía observar durante los eclipses totales de Sol, cuando aparece en forma de capa rozada alrededor del limbo solar. La cromosfera está formada por gases ligeros, hidrógeno, helio, y algunos metales. Su temperatura varia con la proximidad a la corona, desde 4500 oK en la base hasta un millón de grados en la zona de contacto con la corona, y en ella tienen lugar importantes manifestaciones de la actividad solar como son las protuberancias y las fulguraciones. <br>  <br>  Recubriendo la cromosfera se extiende la corona, visible a simple vista durante los eclipses totales de Sol, cuando aparece como una aureola grisácea que se va diluyendo al alejarse del centro. La corona está constituida por un gas sumamente enrarecido que alcanza temperaturas de dos millones de Kelvins; no posee una forma constante y sus dimensiones son difíciles de establecer, por lo que domina la teoría de que se va enrareciendo paulatinamente hasta alcanzar al vacío sideral. La masa total de la cromosfera y la corona es 10-10 veces la masa del Sol. Puede alcanzar un espesor de varios radios solares. <br>  <br>  Si bien la cromosfera y la corona son directamente observables, a diferencia de lo que ocurre con resto del astro, todavía no existe una teoría satisfactoria que explique totalmente los fenómenos que ocurren en ellas. <br>  <br>  Digamos también que la extraordinaria temperatura que alcanza la corona solar en comparación con los 5.800 K de la capa fotosférica superficial es un tema que no está aún suficientemente explicado por la Heliofísica. <br>    <br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  [Regresar al principio]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6. Fusión nuclear del hidrógeno. La estabilidad de la estrella: <br>  <br>  En la parte interna del Sol, en su núcleo, la temperatura puede llegar a los 20.000.000 de kelvin, y las presiones de alrededor de 100.000 millones de atmósferas. En estas condiciones extremas tiene lugar la fusión del Hidrógeno en una reacción que se conoce en física como reacción protón-protón y que da origen a la formación de helio y a la generación de radiación gamma que tiende a expandir a la estrella. <br>  <br>  La reacción nuclear de fusión del Hidrógeno hace combinar a cuatro átomos de Hidrógeno para convertirlos en un átomo de Helio. La masa del átomo de Helio es, sin embargo, 0.7% menor que la masa de los cuatro átomos de Hidrógeno. Esa masa que falta es lo que se convierte en energía que, en forma de rayos gamma se expande desde el núcleo hacia la superficie en los primeros 500.000 kms de espesor de la esfera solar, hasta alcanzar la zona en que el transporte es ya por convección (la zona convectiva) y que permite a los fotones, después de un largo viaje de miles de a?os alcanzar la fotosfera solar. <br>  <br>   <br>  La reacción proton-proton en el interior de la estrella<br>  <br>  Por tanto, tal como se muestra en el gráfico, la reacción nuclear en realidad son dos, dando lugar cada una de ellas a un isótopo de helio. Se puede detallar todo en tres pasos: <br>  <br>  Primero: dos átomos de hidrógeno reaccionan formando deuterio inestable (dos protones y un electrón) perdiéndose un electrón en forma de neutrino y positrón. <br>  <br>  Segundo: el deuterio reacciona con un tercer átomo de hidrógeno formándose el isótopo de Helio y liberando gran cantidad de energía en forma de radiación gamma. <br>  <br>  Tercero: Tal isótopo de helio reacciona con otro, generado por reacción análoga, generándose Helio estable y expidiéndose dos átomos de hidrógeno. <br>  <br>  Como en el primer paso intervienen dos átomos de hidrógeno, y en el segundo uno, en total, en las dos reacciones de obtención de los dos isótopos de helio han intervenido 6 átomos de hidrógeno, de los cuales se expiden (recuperan) dos. Haciendo, pues, el balance, resulta que han intervenido 4 átomos de hidrógeno para obtener un átomo de helio, con generación de neutrinos positrónicos y de energía en forma de radiación gamma. <br>  <br>  Además del problema no resuelto de la explicación de la alta temperatura de la corona solar, existe un segundo gran problema no resuelto para la actual Heliofísica: la detección de los neutrinos que se producen en las reacciones de fusión del Hidrógeno en el núcleo del Sol. <br>  <br>  Esta partícula atraviesa todo el radio solar sin colisionar con otra y, por tanto, es extremadamente difícil detectarla. Pero los experimentos actuales, repartidos por todo el mundo, no logran la cantidad que en teoría deberían recoger. Por lo general solo se detecta la mitad, o la tercera parte de lo esperado. En 1998 han aparecido investigaciones que relacionan este déficit con la llamada "oscilación" de los neutrinos, aún por confirmar, que a su vez implicaría que tienen masa. Según esto, en algún momento, antes de llegar a la Tierra, el tipo de neutrino que se genera en el interior solar cambiaría de estado. <br>  <br>   <br>  Las fuerzas originadas por la fusión del hidrógeno expanden al Sol<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, sabemos que el Sol es una estrella con una gran masa (3344 veces la masa de nuestro planeta), por lo que sufre una gran fuerza de gravitación. Esta fuerza de gravitación, 28 veces mayor que en la Tierra, esto es, el peso de un objeto en la Tierra quedaría multiplicado por 28 en la fotosfera solar, y todo eso, unido al hecho de que el sol tiene una baja densidad (la cuarta parte de la densidad de nuestro planeta), haria que la fuerza de gravitación tienda a colapsar a la estrella bajo su propio peso, a aplastarla. <br>  <br>   <br>  En cambio, la gravitación tiende a aplastar a la estrella, de menor densidad que nuestro propio planeta<br>  <br>  La estabilidad del Sol como estrella se consigue por el equilibrio entre las fuerzas interiores que tienden a expandirla y las fuerzas de gravitación que tienden a comprimirla <br>  <br>   <br>  La existencia estable del Sol depende de un equilibrio de fuerzas. Cuando ese equilibrio se rompa, por falta de hidrógeno, la gravitación ganará la partida<br>  <br>  Cuando, en un futuro, el hidrógeno del Sol comience a escasear (cuando se haya perdido alrededor del 10% del que posee), entonces, las fuerzas de gravitación ganarán la partida a las fuerzas interiores y el Sol se colapsará y empezará a morir. <br>  <br>  En ese momento, el Sol empezará hincharse en capas huecas y rojizas de hidrógeno mientras su núcleo se va comprimiendo cada vez más. Alcanzarán un tama?o cada vez mayor, hasta el punto que engullirá los planetas Mercurio, Venus, la Tierra, convirtiéndose en una estrella gigante roja, y acabará lanzando esas capas de hidrógeno rojizo al vacío interestelar, con lo que quedará solamente el núcleo blanco, pesado, caliente y luminoso en su última etapa moribunda, convertida en una enana blanca del tama?o que hoy puede tener la Tierra. <br>  <br>   <br>  El Sol, cuando empiece a morir, se irá hinchando y lanzando al vacio interestelar capas rojizas de hidrógeno. Es la etapa de gigante roja<br>  <br>  Y las capas de hidrógeno que el Sol lanza al espacio interestelar en su época de gigante roja quedan flotando a merced de las fuerzas de gravitación que tienden a aplastarlas, comprimirlas y calentarlas, hasta que, llegado un momento, cuando se alcancen temperaturas del orden de un millón de kelvin y presiones de cientos de miles de atmósferas, entonces puede saltar la chispa y comenzar a surgir una nueva estrella, donde las fuerzas de fusión del hidrógeno equilibrarían de nuevo a la gravitación. <br>  <br>   <br>  Las nubes de hidrógeno expedidas por el moribundo sol, serán el origen de nuevas estrellas <br>  <br>   <br>  En cualquier momento, ante gigantescas presiones y extraordinarias temperaturas, puede saltar la chispa ... y comenzar a nacer una nueva estrella <br>  <br>   <br>  El chispazo originado por temperaturas de más de 1.000.000 de Kelvins es el comienzo ... <br>  <br>   <br>  Mientras, ..., nuestro Sol irá desapareciendo desde el nucleo en que queda reducido despues de soltar las capas de hidrógeno, convertido en una enana blanca que se irá apgando ...<br>  <br>  La enana blanca en la que se convertirá el Sol se irá apagando poco a poco hasta desaparecer. La muerte del Sol tendrá lugar dentro de no menos 5000 millones de a?os.<br>  <br>  RESUMIENDO : El sol existe hace [namatopía] 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000... millones de millesimos a?os luz<br>  <br>  namatopía por que es indefinido pero se pone un numero namatopial que no existe.<br>  <br>  LA LUNA<br>  <br>   la luna siempre se ve en algún lugar del firmamento, salvo unos pocos días  todos los meses.

Nos ofrece un paisaje desolado y muerto tanto biológica como geológicamente. La Luna es un excelente objeto de observación, donde el aficionado podrá distinguir todo tipo de detalles, aún en el caso de que sólo disponga de un telescopio modesto. Las formaciones típicas lunares son sus cráteres, formados por fuertes impactos de meteoritos, existentes también en otros objetos del sistema solar. Las dimensiones de los cráteres varían ampliamente, clasificándose en  planicies amuralladas (153 km. de diámetro y 2,4 . kmde profundidad en el caso del cráter Tolomeo), circos (93 km. de diámetro y 3,8 km. de profundidad en el cráter Tycho) y cráteres menores. Aparte de los cráteres, existen en la Luna cadenas monta?osas, como los Alpes Lunares, cuyas cimas se elevan 2.000 metros por encima de la llanura del vecino Mare Imbrium.  <br>  <br>  <br>                                    Cráteres de la Luna                                                                             <br>                              <br>  <br>  Cuando la iluminación del Sol es oblicua, las alargadas sombras dan la impresión de que las monta?as lunares son muy escarpadas y sus cimas muy agudas. Asimismo, los cráteres parecen profundas cavidades rodeadas de altas paredes monta?osas. En realidad, la pendiente media de la superficie lunar raramente supera los 30o. <br>  En los Alpes Lunares se encuentra un valle de 130 . kmde longitud llamado Vallis Alpes. Si se cuenta con un telescopio de cierta potencia, pueden observarse grietas y fisuras en numerosos lugares de la luna, como por ejemplo la grieta próxima al cráter Hyginus. El conjunto de fisuras que se hallan cerca del cráter Triesmecker es un excelente objeto para probar la calidad de un telescopio. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  LA LUNA Y SUS FASES. <br>  Por su tama?o, puede decirse que la Luna es casi un peque?o planeta (3.476 km. de diámetro), desprovisto de vida y que gira alrededor de la Tierra a una distancia media de 384.000 . Sekm nos presenta bajo el aspecto de un disco luminoso de 0,5o (30') de diámetro angular. La mitad de la Luna está iluminada por el Sol, mientras que que en la otra mitad es de noche. La línea divisoria entre el día y la noche se llama "terminador". Desde la Tierra, podemos ver la Luna en distintos grados de iluminación denominados "fases". <br>  Cuando la Luna está entre el Sol y la Tierra, resulta invisible para nosotros. Es la llamada Luna Nueva. A  los pocos días, la <br>  Luna aparece en forma de Creciente. La parte oscura del disco está ligeramente  iluminada (luz cenicienta) por la luz reflejada por nuestro planeta. A la edad de 7,4 días, el satélite llega a la fase de Media Luna. Cuando es Luna Llena, vemos todo el hemisferio más próximo plenamente iluminado y parece entonces un disco perfecto. Pasados 22,1 días desde la Luna Nueva, se pasa a la fase de Media Luna de nuevo; al cabo de 29,53 días (llamado Mes Sinódico) el ciclo termina y vuelve a empezar. <br>  En la zona del Terminador, el ángulo de incidencia de los rayos solares es muy peque?o y las sombras alargadas ponen de relieve los detalles del paisaje lunar, como cráteres y monta?as. <br>  <br>  <br>       <br>      LUNA NUEVA<br>       <br>     LUNA CRECIENTE<br>         <br>        LUNA LLENA<br>                 <br>       LUNA DECRECIENTE<br>      <br>        LUNA NUEVA<br>   <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  CARA VISIBLE DE LA LUNA <br>  Incluso sin telescopio, no resulta difícil distinguir en la Luna las zonas oscuras llamadas mares, y las zonas claras, denominadas continentes . Las formas y contornos de los mares son de gran utilidad para orientarse en la exploración de la Luna con el telescopio. Resulta también muy útil conocer sus nombres. <br>  Los llamados mares no contienen agua en absoluto; en realidad se trata de superficies de lava solidificada que rellena las grandes cuencas originadas por el impacto de enormes meteoros, hecho registrado hace unos 3.500 millones de a?os. La superficie de los mares es relativamente lisa y un telescopio peque?o no revela accidentes importantes. Con un telescopio algo más potente se pueden explorar las zonas claras de cráteres, las cadenas monta?osas, etc. Durante la Luna Llena es cuando mejor se pueden apreciar las irradiaciones luminosas que proceden de ciertos cráteres importantes como, Tycho , Copérnico , <br>  Kepler y Aristarco. El resto de las particularidades lunares son difíciles de distinguir cuando el ángulo de incidencia de los rayos del Sol es muy grande; la visibilidad es óptima en las regiones próximas al terminador , donde los accidentes lunares proyectan sombras largas y bien definidas. <br>  <br>  <br>                     LAS DOS CARAS DE LA LUNA<br>  <br>  CARA OCULTA DE LA LUNA <br>  La luna ofrece siempre la misma cara a la Tierra, lo que no quiere decir que no tenga movimiento propio de rotación. En realidad, la Luna tarda exactamente el mismo tiempo en completar su órbita que en dar una vuelta en torno a sí misma. Sin embargo, todas las regiones de la Luna reciben, en un momento o en otro, la luz del Sol. <br>  Si se ha conseguido confeccionar mapas detallados de la cara oculta ha sido gracias a las sondas espaciales. En la cara oculta se encuentran varios mares de peque?as dimensiones, cubiertos de material de color oscuro. Las zonas claras son las dominantes. Tienen una topografía muy diversificada y están cubiertas de cráteres, como ocurre con los continentes de la cara visible. <br>  Pese a todo lo dicho, la "cara oculta" de la Luna no lo es tanto. Existen irregularidades del movimiento de la Luna (llamadas "libraciones") que la ponen parcialmente al descubierto ante el observador terrestre. Así, antes de que empezaran los lanzamientos de las sondas espaciales, se había podido cartografiar el 59% de la superficie total de la Luna, es decir, bastante más de la mitad. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  ECLIPSE DE LUNA <br>  Cuando la Luna pasa por la línea imaginaria que une los centros del Sol y la Tierra, entra en el cono de sombra proyectado por la Tierra y tiene lugar un eclipse de Luna. <br>  La Tierra proyecta en el espacio un cono de total oscuridad (sombra o umbra) rodeado de una zona de oscuridad parcial (penumbra ). Pueden darse tres casos: que la Luna entre en su zona de penumbra, que entre totalmente en zona de sombra, o que entre parcialmente en sombra y el resto en penumbra. En el segundo caso, se habla de eclipse total, y en el tercero de eclipse parcial. En el primero de los casos (llamado eclipse de penumbra, y que se manifiesta por un ligero oscurecimiento del disco lunar) es bastante raro, pues la Luna "cabe justamente" en el anillo de penumbra. <br>  <br>  <br>    En el transcurso de un eclipse de luna, el oscurecimiento no llega a ser completo y la débil luz de nuestro satélite tiene un ligero tono rojizo. Tal color se debe a la refracción de los  rayos solares al pasar por la atmósfera de la Tierra.

Cancer is delighted to take care of the home and children while Capricorn goes out in the world to earn the family's keep. Each helps the other to fulfill an ambition, in realms that are perfectly complementary. The Saturnine personality benefits from Cancer's intuition, and the moonchild appreciates Capricorn's ability to achieve financial security. They take the time to love, understand, and cuddle each other.

fXjWXFIpaa	In Pasadena, Mrs. Davis sends her daughter Aubrey Davis to Tokyo to bring her sister Karen Davis, who is interned in a hospital after surviving a fire, back to the USA. After their meeting, Karen dies and Aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and gets herself trapped in the same situation, being chased by the ghost of the house. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the three high school mates Allison, Vanessa and Miyuki visit the famous haunted house and are also chased by the ghost. In Chicago, Trish moves to the apartment of her boyfriend Bill, who lives with his children, the teenager Lacey and boy Jake. On the next door, weird things happen with their neighbor.We agree with Ron, what do the people in Chicago have to do with anything? or the girls who go to the haunted house? isn't just about Karen and Audrey? whatever......... the first ones better for everyone who is debating whether to see this movie or not!! Set within two years after the first film and between two countries. Karen's sister, Audrey, been affected by the supernatural curse, and trying to find the origin of it in order to find a way to free herself. But what has this quest got to do with the families who are living in Chicago, a photojournalist from Hong Kong,and the three schoolgirls from Tokyo's International High School?|`|AA11547859	Why would you even see the grudge 2 after the first one being a complete piece of crap?

But you can download "enhanced" podcasts that have pictures to go along with the topic of conversation. Those are pretty neat.  And you can put your digital pictures on the Nano.  <br>  <br>  Even without video, the Nanos are pretty cool.  And they are a lot smaller and cuter than the big video iPods.

If the TV shows aren't playing at all that probably means that you don't have Quicktime 7. After you've hooked it up it should automatically start syncing the shows onto your ipod.

Sin embargo, Disney se ha apresurado a declarar que esos rumores son infundados y que nunca han hecho comentarios sobre ese tema.<br>  <br>  Tal vez todo sea una maniobra publicitaria para que no se deje de hablar demasiado tiempo de esta franquicia que, recordemos, ha batido unos cuantos récords de taquilla no solo en EEUU sino también en Espa?a, consiguiendo superar la friolera de más de 1 Billón de dólares (en EEUU 1 billón = 1000 millones) de recaudación por todo el mundo.|`|levmXLPFaa	ojala pero también escuche q los protagonistas Orlando y Keira no querían.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!  My husband was in desert storm at the time and so it really hit home with everyone on the army post.  <br>  <br>  I think I remember most of the words because I taught it to my daughter years ago.  It is one of her favorite songs and we sing it all Christmas season.   I even called a radio station in Nashville to see if they could track it down for me a couple of years ago.  No luck.  With all the war in the world the song is so relavent.  I wish whoever recorded it would release it again.  I'll try to post the lyrics.  If you need the tune I could have my daughter sing it and then e-mail it to you.  Though she's not  professional singer by any means.  It would be for your reference if you forgot the tune.  I did have it on a cassette tape when I taped it off the radio to play for people at work.  But who knows where that tape is.<br>  <br>  Stephanie e-mail is:  lind(a)cinci.rr.com<br>  <br>  (Some more of the lyrics)<br>  <br>  The frost is on the window and the snow is everywhere<br>  but it doesn't feel like Christmas without someone you care.<br>  See Daddy is a soldier and he has to do his part to keep our<br>  country safe from harm but it means we'll be apart.<br>  I know he's doing what is right and I'm so proud of him.<br>  But who will put the star on top when the christmas tree is trimmed?<br>  You can keep your toys dear Santa<br>  'cause they're not on my list.<br>  It isn't very long this year 'cause I've only got one wish.<br>  See mom and I are on our own and we're here all alone<br>  Santa can you bring my daddy home?<br>  I know that there are other kids who feel the way I do.<br>  Some have moms and dads and family serving too.<br>  We'll miss them all this Christmas and we'll love them even more.<br>  Peace on earth means more this year than it ever did before.<br>  You can keep your toys dear Santa<br>  cause they're not on my list.<br>  It isn't very long this year 'cause I've only got one wish.<br>  See mom and I are on our own and we're here all alone.<br>  Santa can you bring my daddy home?<br>  Santa can you bring my daddy home?|`|6d4ab87c855027ff92eec5238fa1b5baaa	Don't feel bad, I'm trying to find this song somewhere myself. <br>  <br>  Indeed it was sung by a 4th or 5th grade girl in Baltimore, whose friend's father was in the Gulf War. The name of the song is "Santa Can you Bring My Daddy Home?". <br>  <br>  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the girl who sang it. It had a lot of airplay at the time, especially in Baltimore, but has since faded into memory it seems. Ever since the War in Iraq started, I've been hoping to hear it, but with no luck. I had it taped myself, but the tape has been lost. I can't seem to find any info online about it either. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you in your search. Hopefully we'll both get lucky.|`|eb4f45a7f7a520f0a65e0fd635ed55f7aa	This song has been haunting me also!  I live in Baltimore and I just phoned our local radio station which is playing continuous Christmas music, but the dj did not know of the song.  She is going to see if she can find it and said she would e-mail me if she does. If I can locate any more information I will pass it along.  I hope we can solve this mystery!

no?<br>  <br>  - Naturalmente abuelo -Contestó el gallo joven- algún problema?<br>  <br>  - No claro -dijo el gallo viejo- solo que entre compa?eros, y delante de las damas te ruego que no me dejes mal, y me des una salida airosa.<br>  <br>  - Qué propones? - pregunto el jovencito.<br>  <br>  - Pues mira... yo ya no estoy en disposición de pelear, por lo que te sugiero una carrera de tres vueltas alrededor del gallinero <br>  <br>  - Eso esta hecho - dijo el joven muy contento de liquidar el asunto de una forma tan fácil.<br>  <br>  - Pero para ser justos, y dado que el reuma no me deja correr muy bien, te rogaria que me dieras media vuelta de ventaja.<br>  <br>  - No hay ningun problema- dijo el gallo joven muy seguro de sus posibilidades.<br>  <br>  De este modo empezo la carrera, y antes del que el gallo viejo hubiera completado la segunda vuelta, ya tenia al gallo joven pisandole los espolones.<br>  <br>  Cuando de repente se oyo un tremendo escopetazo, y el gallo jovencito quedo despanzurrado en el suelo entre un charco de sangre y una nube de plumas...<br>  <br>  - Me carga la chingada...! dijo el granjero con una escopeta humeante entre las manos.<br>  <br>  - Es el tercer gallo puto que me venden esta semana.|`|D04WUx5Zaa	jajajjajajajajjajajajaj<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

gIexvnCFaa	Hola, mi pelicula favorita es Cinema Paradiso. Es una de esas peliculas que cuando terminas de ver te deja reflexionando un rato en el final y, por supuesto, me hizo llorar mucho, como con ninguna otra pelicula. Las actuaciones especialmente la de el peque?o en la mayoria de la pelicula son excelentes. En mi opinion el cine italiano es uno de los mejores que existen. El resultado de la pelicula tambien se noto a la hora de las premiaciones, ha recibido muchisimos premios internacionales.

bCeJGqHvaa	In the Buu saga Majin Buu does absorb several different characters. Although I am not quite sure the exact amount of people I do know that he absorbs Gohan, Chibi Trunks and Chibi Goten. When Vegeta and Kakarott go to fight him they fuse to create Vegito but Buu also absorbs them as well. During this event they separate from their fused form and travel through Buu to find their children. As far as Buu absorbing Freiza, even though Freiza is dead they show him often in the Underworld. I can not remember right now if Buu absorbs him but it is plausible for him to do so considering Underworld travel is common in the DBZ world.|`|VCrIOQVGaa	To answer the question itself, Buu doesn't absorb Freeza or Cell

eNSgj5Moaa	What an excellent point!! Thank you for bringing this up. I had the exact same thought when I first came across this section.  <br>  <br>  I know many people do not take astrology seriously, and I'm perfectly fine with that. That is their right and I respect it.<br>  <br>  However, there are also many people who do take Astrology seriously, and placing it under "entertainment" only serves to trivialise it. <br>  <br>  I don't much mind whether it is categorised under "beliefs", but it should certainly be called "Astrology" and not be categorised as "entertainment".<br>  <br>  "Horoscopes" is a misnomer since this refers to a very specific and rather frivolous area of Astrology.<br>  <br>  Calling this section "Astrology" would, I believe, also attract many more serious questions and answers.<br>  <br>  Thank you once again for raising this issue :)|`|AA11610394	uzc the predictions dont come true<br>  the compatability stuff is correct|`|b1b3472d676e9936d78fe0968d48908baa	They put it in the "entertainment" category as a tongue-in-cheek way of saying, with a wink and a grin, that astrology is a form of personal entertainment, like skate-boarding or arm wrestling, not a scientific phenomena and definitely not a religious belief. In many respects, putting it in the entertainment category, diminishes it's over-all value (if it has any) and is demeaning to hard-core adherents to its cosmic philosophy.|`|Mlwd5Bt3aa	I'm not completely positive, but I would think that it's because horoscopes might be something that is considered part of popular culture and not religion or beliefs.  <br>  <br>  I know I probably should say, but I think horoscopes are false.  I took an Astronomy course last year and learned about the ideas and generalizations of horoscopes.  The reason you get your horoscope sign is because when you are born that astrological star constellation is "sharing" that part of the sky with the sun.  All the astrological signs run in the path of the sun (known as the ecliptic) and there is actually a total of thirteen ecliptic constellations, but only twelve are well known; "Ophiuchus" is the constellation that isn't part of the horoscopes.  But the other error with horoscopes is that the location of the sun on the ecliptic has been changing slightly every year, so since the creation of the horoscope the astrological signs are off by one sign. So, if you are born on say December 9th (My birthday :D) the current horoscope dates say my sign is Sagittarius, BUT according to the sky during my date of birth I should be Capricorn.<br>  <br>  I don't want to bore you to death, you can see the source I'm siting for more info. <br>  <br>  I use to believe in horoscopes, but now I just read it for the novelty of it. :)|`|cIcJLkeWaa	why ask why???? are u a gemini by chance????|`|sGtBekvVaa	astrology is not a belief it is something that you study in London university...you can belief tarot..or not to belief..but astrology is a science

7c55cfc3ea989aba2e4617222bfdee10aa	On June 25, 2002, the band released Live...One Nation Underground, which was a live album recorded by The Union Underground.<br>  <br>  Two years went by with nothing from The Union Underground. Finally, in the summer of 2004, an exclusive interview was conducted with Patrick Kennison. Patrick explained many things about The Union Underground, such as Bryan Scott having possibly been on drugs, also that he wanted to work alone and wanted everything perfect. Patrick also explained how Bryan wouldn't return the calls from Columbia.<br>  <br>  After getting angry with Bryan and his attitude, Patrick and the two other band members left The Union Underground. Patrick said the band name is co-owned by Bryan and himself.

NcqThgI3aa	Concuerdo contigo totalmente, Cuando seas mía, a pesar de que es la segunda versión de Café con aroma de mujer, es muy buena, a mi me gustó mucho, ahora que está en la tele, es la tercera vez que la pasan y no me canso de verla.

18af157c970f5cdd2e2d5d0943c5ecdcaa	Al link che ti do puoi ricalcolare segno ed ascendente (con luogo, data ed ora di nascita) ed avere il tuo profilo.<br>  Ci sono poi molte informazioni interessanti da leggere.<br>  <br>  Ciao<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cicap.org/piemonte/oroscopo/oroscopo.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cicap.org/piemonte/oroscopo/o...</a>|`|rbqhEQ7zaa	VERGINE<br>  <br>  PERSONALITA'  <br>  Le qualità di Mercurio, un Mercurio di terra che ispira soprattutto grande concretezza, emergono particolarmente nella vita pratica dei Vergini. Efficienza, laboriosità, scrupolosa attenzione ai dettagli, capacità di programmazione accurata, previdenza, sono tutte doti facilmente riscontrabili nei nativi. Il loro rigore logico, alimentato poi dall’esigenza di avere una visione analitica e precisa di ogni esperienza è l’elemento di forza che determina il loro comportamento e le loro reazioni. La necessità di tenere sotto controllo ogni situazione che vivono produce un’attività mentale che affina certamente la loro lucidità di giudizio, ma può anche sconfinare in una sterile analisi che genera poi ansia e incertezze. Il punto debole della personalità Vergine è la difficoltà di rilassare la mente e tacitarne i giudizi troppo severi, per lasciarsi invece andare più serenamente alle proprie emozioni. La natura riservata e introversa del segno genera un pudore sui propri sentimenti che a volte non permette l’espressione più genuina degli impulsi del cuore, così da suscitare una sensazione di freddezza in chi li avvicina. <br>  Amanti dell’ordine, a volte anche con qualche sfumatura un po’ maniacale, i nativi amano pianificare l’esistenza in modo da non lasciare spazio all’imprevisto e tenersi sui binari di una rassicurante routine. I cambiamenti, le novità, li destabilizzano e risvegliano le loro insicurezze, anche se di fronte a prospettive allettanti, perché spesso i Vergini nutrono più o meno segreti complessi d’inferiorità. Lo spirito critico e la sensibilità nervosa li rendono refrattari alla passione e rende più difficile liberarsi di certe inibizioni che ostacolano i loro slanci affettivi.<br>  <br>  LA DONNA VERGINE  <br>  Di lei colpisce la serietà, lo spirito d’osservazione, la limpida razionalità dei giudizi. E’ certamente una donna impeccabile sotto tanti punti di vista, perché sa organizzare il lavoro, il ménage domestico, la sua vita con la precisione e l’efficienza di un direttore d’azienda, senza trascurare nessun dettaglio e senza sprechi nella sua ordinatissima pianificazione. In lei però spesso questo culto per l’efficienza tradisce una forte componente di insicurezza e di nervosismo che non le consentono di affrontare le situazioni più rilassata e fiduciosa, aperta a tutte le possibilità. Il suo senso critico spesso si punta un po’ impietosamente su se stessa e sugli altri, rendendola insofferente, mai soddisfatta e sempre alle prese con problemi anche banali, ma che lei vive come ostacoli insormontabili. E’ una donna che ama occuparsi di tutto e rendersi utile, capace di dimenticare se stessa per soddisfare le richieste altrui e compiere piccoli servizi per gli amici, dispensare le sue cure sollecite alle persone che ama. Ma ahimè, ha il lamento facile e non si accorge, quando è pressata dagli impegni di aver creato lei stessa gli ingranaggi da cui non sa più come liberarsi. Dire "no" non è semplice per questa donna fondamentalmente timida e poco intraprendente. In amore si muove con grande cautela, e con tutto il suo bagaglio di insicurezze, che non facilitano certo l’incontro con l’altro sesso.<br>  L’attrazione è quasi sempre di tipo mentale, per lei, sostenuta anche da attente valutazioni sulle qualità del partner e sulle prospettive di sicurezza e stabilità che lui le offre. Un uomo esuberante e caldo può però risvegliare in lei il suo lato femminile più segreto e impedirle di diventare una compagna ipercritica e troppo pignola. E’ una madre scrupolosa e prodiga di cure materiali, ma anche molto ansiosa e a volte assillante con le sue richieste e le sue continue preoccupazioni.<br>  <br>  I RAPPORTI  <br>  Con i compagni di Terra, Toro e Capricorno, l’accordo è felice e molto produttivo, anche sul piano professionale. Anche con i segni d’Acqua, Cancro, Scorpione e Pesci, la Vergine si relaziona bene, perché acquista da loro profondità di sentimento e ricchezza emotiva e fornisce a sua volta costruttività ed equilibrio. Ariete e Sagittario con la loro esuberanza travolgente sono proprio incompatibili e destabilizzanti per la metodica Vergine. Con i Gemelli può esserci una forte attrazione ma anche un continuo conflitto, spesso stimolante ma anche logorante nel tempo. Bilancia e Leone, per quanto diversi di natura, possono trovare discreti punti di contatto con la Vergine. <br>  <br>  VERGINE ASCENDENTE PESCI<br>  I nati con l'ascendete sotto questo segno sono il riflesso dell'ambiente in cui vivono, lavorativo e/o familiare.<br>  Abituati al sacrifici corrono il rischio di non essere gratificati abbastanza per questo loro impegno, gli altri (parenti o colleghi di lavoro) danno per scontato la loro presenza e il loro apporto. <br>  Poco adatti a ricoprire ruoli di primo ordine, danno il meglio se si impiegano come "gregari"|`|QkAYCpIzaa	Ha un profumo un po fortino, e finisce per cambiare ascendente.<br>  Va d'accordo con gli uomini che gli vogliono virgine.<br>  ciao notte.

This technique may be a third Mangekyou skill in a trio named after mythological deities. The first is Amaterasu, next is Tsukuyomi and this may be Susanoo.<br>  <br>  To begin Kakashi formed a handseal to change his normal three tomoe Sharingan into a new Mangekyou form. He then focused on an area of his target. The surrounding area then began to warp and collapse in on itself, quickly reducing the surround area to nothingness. The technique will thus essentially transport the focused area away to another location. The technique caused a huge strain on Kakashi, utilizing a great deal of chakra. He was able to use the technique twice in succession and then revert back to three tomoe, it is unknown how many times he could use it before total exertion.

876cbf012d2a6e5a65ea34157112a9fcaa	Not according to George Lucas. The six existing films make up what was originally a single story, the story of how Anakin Skywalker became a Jedi, was lured to the Dark Side, and was ultimately redeemed by his son. Anything more would be an addendum to that story. There will be no film-based explanation of what happened to Darth Vader during the years that Luke and Leia were growing up. To do so would require that episodes 4,5 and 6 be renumbered.<br>  <br>  George has talked of a television project in the works. It will take place in the Star Wars universe, but no details on what time frame will be used have been released. One can assume that there will be new characters and that existing characters will only be referenced or mentioned from time to time, but not seen.|`|AA12377617	It should have mark hamill and harison ford and carrie fisher when their old and they have a kid who turns to the sith, yah thats it|`|AA11261749	No.|`|418d2603e6a706c647d24dd367a16227aa	there are rumors that there will be a 7th episode to sum up everything but it is most likely that that won't happen. george lucas has said no, but hopefully he'll change his mind!|`|AA11123408	nope, however all of the originals will be rereleased in Digital 3d.|`|AA11292676	Why? The story is complete... kind of.    At the end of Return of the Jedi three things happen:  1) Luke becomes the only living Jedi so it's up to him to be the sole protector of peace,   2) Anakin comes full circle, and 3) Han Solo and Princess Leia are hooked up.    Now, what happens to the latter?   Do they have kids? Twins, perhaps? Strong in the force, perhaps?   George Lucas has created a saga that leaves a minimum of open questions and is very entertaining to boot. However, I wouldn't let it keep you up at night.  The story is substantially complete and makes sense.  That's more than you can say about most movies these days.|`|a47d727bc453e518ffee861f5b9a2df6aa	Maybe but is not going to be George Lucas. Maybe some other famous director like Steven Spielberg.|`|AA10382703	I hope so...<br>  Something that would create perhaps  the link before Clone wars or perhaps the growing up of Luke and Leia and how the empire got so powerful until how the rebels were going to Alderan and got captured by empire fleet begining of episode 4...<br>  But I can't wait to see what Lucas will do with Indiana Jones 4...|`|e91fbffe4a8422cf45a77eefbffa89ddaa	There have been rumors, but George Lucas himself said that he isn't planning on making anymore but they are working on a Indiana Jones 4, and a Jurrasic Park 4 so you never know.

ecf0a494bf7a4226174720f401735fa9aa	Just my opinion, but the best way to show him how you feel is to make a good mix of metal songs.  If you only focus on love songs, it will get old pretty fast.  Plus, they tend to get poppy, and he might not like that...or listen to it.  Take a glance through his collection, see what bands he likes, then do a search on Amazon or cdnow.com, and find out what albums he doesn't own.  Take a listen to clips of songs that you like of those bands, and make it your own.  So that way it's something new for him, and you'll be able to listen to the mix together.  Sign up for Napster for a month, and you can download just the songs you want, make a mix of it, and cancel the Napster account.|`|1fe6b4776fd85ea76284cdda9b26fc13aa	heavy metal love song... too...scary...must find... new... music|`|a8b248708f6e982ebb4ff5071b74f39baa	Great question.<br>  <br>  "Home Sweet Home" - Motley Crue<br>  "Your Love is Driving Me Crazy" - Sammy Hagar<br>  "Top of the World" - Van Halen<br>  "When It's Love" - Van Halen<br>  "I Thank You" - ZZ Top<br>  "The One I Love" - R.E.M.<br>  "Let's Make It" - AC/DC<br>  "Touch Too Much" - AC/DC<br>  "Cheap Trick" - The Flame<br>  "Let Me Be the One" - Def Leppard<br>  "I Touch Myself" - Divinyls<br>  "Think About You" - Guns 'n' Roses<br>  "The Crush of Love" - Joe Satriani<br>  "All We Are" - Kim Mitchell<br>  "I Was Made for Lovin' You" - KISS<br>  "Screaming in the Night" - Krokus<br>  "All of My Love" - Led Zeppelin<br>  "Thank You" - Led Zeppelin<br>  "A Million Miles Away" - Lenny Kravitz<br>  "Close My Eyes (Forever)" - Ozzy Osbourne & Lita Ford<br>  "No One Like You" - Scorpions<br>  "With Arms Wide Open" - Creed<br>  "If I Die Tomorrow" - Motley Crue<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|AA11845480	that depends...old or new?<br>  <br>  I can't think of many|`|3689d7e1cc10a1ed70f13645d3e74504aa	How about "Close My Eyes Forever" by Ozzy Osbourne and Lita Ford?

599deeeb5cfeee4b66d269be4b16e103aa	The kiss at the end of II erased her memory.  The original ending (because I and II were shot at the same time) was the spinning back of the world angle used in I, to make time go backward and her to never know.  They decided to use it for 1 because they didn't really have an ending.  Donner expected to have time to come up with a new ending for II, but he wasn't brought back for it.|`|0a71d76dfa1ab1ac5d93f86e92f2f955aa	At the end of "Superman II", he kissed her when he was in her office. While they were kissing, he somehow hypnotized her into forgetting his identity.<br>  <br>  Yes, she remembered it in "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace", but he made her forget again. <br>  <br>  However, since the events that led up to "Superman Returns" pretty much stomps on the other two films that came after "Superman II", we can pretty much take it as "gospel" that Lois has been made to forget Clark and Superman are the same.<br>  <br>  (And besides which, I ain't buying that whole thing about the kid is his anyway.)|`|AA11193649	In 2, at the end he kisses her and she forgets all of the events in the film. if you recall, Lois asked a fellow staffer what's been going on in the world, and the woman looked as though she'd lost her mind.<br>  <br>  In that era of Superman Mythos some sources give him psychic abilities so that is the source basis for the mind wipe kiss. <br>  <br>  As to the not knowing his ID, I think that it looks bad that Superman knocked her up w/o allowing her to keep that know ledge. but also the idea of his secret ID is that since he is a public figure as Superman and makes no attempts to disguise himself, like Batman, that he is Superman 24/7 and does not possess any ID beyond Superman, world's biggest Boy Scout.<br>  <br>  In Returns, you may also notice that both Richard, and Jason looked at him as though they might figure it out, and as Richard started to put it together Clark heard him, and he tripped to make him think twice. I personally think Jason has figured it out, but being 5 no one will listen if he tells them.|`|AA11566165	Clark Kent is too stupid to be Superman.|`|b5e9a961e7b391819cab9116e2c3eab6aa	Well, technically, in the second one (at the end) he makes her forget everything she knew about him.|`|d8ac7dfd341def99d4987b048d08c1e6aa	Because she's an idiot, like every one else who can't figure out that a guy that looks exactly like superman and never wears a mask and is always disappearing when superman shows up might just be superman. Especially if you conceived a child with him, how could you be that close and still be that clueless?|`|AA11623512	honestly, i found myself wondering throughout the whole movie how he is able to disguise himself by taking off his glasses and slicking back his hair (except of course for that little curly q of hair), and it kinda makes ya question the intelligence of all the other people, ESPECIALLY Lois....i mean, they had sex, you'd think she would have been close enough to his face to go waiiiit.....i know you from somewhere!! but then, no person could end up with perfect hair and not a single scratch after being tossed around a crashing plane either, so you just kinda have to accept that it's a movie and that's just the way it is.|`|AA12238930	I guess because she thinks she had sex with Superman, and not Clark Kent. Maybe the lights were out :)
671193e78d33dab85c6399fdbb3251c6aa	You may be thinking of Bambi or if it's a Christmas movie Nestor the Long-Eared Donkey. It's been a while since I watched it so the summery might be a little off, but this is the basics. Nestor was made fun of because of his abnormally largve ears so he runs away. His mother goes to find them and they are caught in a snow storm. Nestor's mother covers him with her own body and dies during the night. It's a wonderful and sad little story, one of the few that makes me a little weepy.|`|1b9b8fad4d695b3f4217c0db0f9e4682aa	Uh, are you thinking of Bambi..?|`|AA11547859	I think you mean Bambi|`|14808da9a5e166783e89fbd20eaf44d0aa	Yes its in a hunting show HAHAHAHAHAHAHA YUMMMY!

dbd095513996482b3b15839b05e1ecc6aa	Originally a Broadway play that opened at the Alvin Theatre on April 21, 1977. The New York production ran for 2,377 performances, making it the third longest running musical of the 1970s. In 1982, the movie version directed by John Houston (Anjelica Houston's father), was released starring Albert Finney, Ann Reinking, Carol Burnett, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, and newcomer Aileen Quinn from Pittsburgh, PA. <br>  <br>  The idea of creating a musical based on Harold Gray's "Little Orphan Annie" comic strip originated with lyricist/director Martin Charnin. Playwright Thomas Meehan and composer Charles Strouse were initially skeptical of the idea, but Charnin quickly won them over with his enthusiasm for the project.<br>  <br>  The story revolves around Annie, an 11-year-old orphan who longs for her parents to rescue her from the Municipal Orphanage and its mean-spirited matron, Agatha Hannigan. When billionaire Oliver Warbucks stumbles upon the little orphan and decides to adopt her, he must first deal with Miss Hannigan's opportunistic schemes.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	Orphan that is rescued by Daddy Warbucks to come live in his big mansion.  Then there is a terrible couple who try to claim that she is theirs.  My sister was one of the orphans when she was a kid.  I would suggest she rent the movie....it is a classic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and yes she will have a lot of lines and she is the main character...CONGRATS TO HER!  That is a great part to land.|`|9209bf3e2a54e7d2a04c5ea88a73b2e1aa	That is a major role. She must be real good! Congrats to her! Don't screw it up for her. Don't complain that she is taking too much time with the play and not paying attention to you. This is Annie, for God's sake!|`|a286ce3f2cdffba4d03af6aa15ba282caa	She has alot of lines and she sings alot too. She even sings to a dog!!!|`|f1cb0b0feedcff76a42dca51d1581114aa	OMG I love that movie, anyways the movie is about a plucky, red haired girl who dreams of life outside her dreary orphanage. One day, Annie  is chosen to stay for one week with the famous billionaire "Daddy" Warbucks . One week turns into many, and the only person standing in the way of Annie's fun is Miss Hannigan, the gin-soaked ruler of the orphanage .  Miss Hannigan's  attempts to kidnap the irrepressible Annie <br>  Also the movie is a musical annie has some what alot of lines because shes the main character but mostly she sings.|`|fc56bbca111b6dbda688dc4ca553eb32aa	Annie is the main character and she is an orphan...

At least band goes to 'THE GAMES'. Orchestra goes to symphony halls! Anyway, I think people are just jealous of people who can do things that others can't, like play instruments. If a person wants to play an instrument, then they should do it. Artists should not throw away a gift because someone else does not have it. If a person spends their whole life catering to what everyone else thinks, then that person will never know who they truly are and what they could have accomplished.|`|a4fddaf6a1e7cc689b0611f98a1c96acaa	I do not agree.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	I would say he is wrong.|`|AA12052739	i think drex is wrong

Well, I have such a Friend. I want to tell you about Him. He is the most Honorable Person I know. I can share with Him, I can ask for advise and just enjoy His presence.

(Remember, he was on the radio before anyone saw him.)  White kids in the 50s were drawn to black music because it had rhythm, energy and sexuality.  No white performers were doing that.  Sun Records in Memphis primarily recorded black artists at that time, but when Elvis recorded for them, in some ways he broke down racial barriers and made it okay for white kids to like black music and openly listen to the blues.   His musical tastes were gospel and blues.  In many ways he bridged the gap between black musicians and white kids.  Blues evolved into rock and roll primarily because he provided the catalyst and the bridge between the two genres and the two races.

They say so on one of the special features on the DVD.|`|405e55575cf64d94ff2b9f66a3e8eb00aa	The Wendigo (also Windigo, Wiindigoo, Windago, Windiga, and numerous other variants) is a spirit in Algonquian mythology. It has also become a stock horror character much like the vampire or werewolf, although these fictional depictions often do not bear much resemblance to the original mythology. "Windigo Psychosis" is a culture-bound disorder which involves an intense craving for human flesh and fear that one will turn into a cannibal, occurring among Algonquian Indian cultures.<br>  <br>  To Algonquian-speaking tribes of Native Americans, the Wendigo is a malevolent supernatural creature. It is usually described as a giant with a heart of ice; sometimes it is thought to be entirely made of ice. Its body is skeletal and deformed, with missing lips and toes.<br>  The first accounts of the Wendigo myth by explorers and missionaries date back to the 17th century. They describe it rather generically as a werewolf, devil, or cannibal.<br>  The Wendigo was usually presumed to have once been human. Different origins of the Wendigo are described in variations of the myth. A hunter may become the Wendigo when encountering it in the forest at night, or when becoming possessed by its spirit in a dream. When the cannibalistic element of the myth is stressed, it is assumed that anyone who eats corpses in a famine becomes a Wendigo as a result. The only way to destroy a Wendigo is to melt its heart of ice. In recent times, it has been identified with Sasquatch or Bigfoot by cryptozoologists,[citation needed] but there is little evidence in the indigenous folklore for it being a similar creature.<br>  Perhaps this myth was used as a deterrent and cautionary tale among northern tribes whose winters were long and bitter and whose hunting parties often were trapped in storms with no recourse but to consume members of their own party. Its physical deformities are suggestive of starvation and frostbite, so the Wendigo may be a myth based on a personification of the hardships of winter and the taboo of cannibalism.

TGKjkKLSaa	There are a few ways we are aware of. One is contact some radio stations online and fm. Also there are sites that can get you in contact their promoters which yes does take awhile to get done but nothing is easy in the music world. Another way is trying to contact them through myspace. Our boss suggests using all of those. Also here is a link to get you a bunch of artists sites. Hope we helped. ENJOY! and good luck|`|8383cb5f8e740ea6869df1ec316508c5aa	I share your pain. I have also written hundreds in the same timeframe of which you speak -many of which were hits in not only the opinions of friends/other musicians',  but were clearly better than other crap out there.  Two got on the radio and one made $90 while the other made $1,000 of which I had to give all to payola to keep it spinning.  Had a song ripped off that went up so far it made $100,000 for the thief.  That is why music is my hobby/love and not my profession.  It is a ruthless game that can't be won unless you just happen to have connections, are strange, appeal to the ignorant masses with no taste, are lucky or have sex with the record producer or know how to be a blackmailer, or were born into a rich family and can buy your way in thru publicity.

5b1d604fa7114cdb7a4b93350eb4cfddaa	Un Hammam, también conocido como ba?o turco o hamam, es un método para limpiar el cuerpo y relajarse que fue particularmente popular durante la Era Victoriana. El proceso que envolvía tomar un ba?o turco es similar al de un sauna, pero está más relacionado con las prácticas de ba?o de los romanos.<br>  <br>  Tomar un ba?o turco primero envuelve la relajación en un cuarto (conocido como cuarto tibio) que es calentado con un flujo continuo de aire caliente que permite que el ba?ista respire libremente. Los ba?istas luego se mueven a un cuarto aun más caliente (conocido como cuarto caliente) antes de sumergirse en una piscina fría. Después de hacerse un lavado completo de cuerpo y recibir un masaje, los ba?istas finalmente se retiran al cuarto de enfriamiento para un período de relajación.|`|yHkHinaMaa	Porque es típico de Turquía, digo yo.|`|1d7d60c225432be74a5befc988fd4e0daa	Por su origen.|`|31f52475234c07b91443eb938652ede2aa	Antes de los Turcos, los Romanos, los Bizantinos y la gente nómada de la región tenían sus propios rituales de ba?o. Aquellas tradiciones crearon un nuevo concepto que los Europeos lo llamaron " El Ba?o Turco ".<br>  <br>  Un ba?o Turco combina cuatro elementos básicos, el calor seco, el calor húmedo, frío y el masaje. Estos elementos estimulan y limpian el cuerpo además de mejorar la salud. El ba?ista primero entra en una sala caliente, el cuerpo empezará a sudar hasta que la acción del vapor se mantenga el nivel de sudoración. Uno mismo se limpia con agua y jabón mediante de un masaje relajante. Después se toma un ba?o frío para que el cuerpo vuelva a la temperatura normal......*-*|`|3mUMzdelaa	muy fácil, pués xq es d turkía|`|b2f9a276d248462f6834589f11e7e64baa	porque le quisieron llamar ba?o turco...|`|2252ejWxaa	Ps por q si !!!|`|MBY5NhE7aa	porque te kedas como un rey , y en comparacioon se lo pusieron|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	porque si<br>  hay  yo k se <br>  tu pregunta me dio risa no se porque|`|bq5iHNE9aa	porque es un ba?o que generalmente se efectua en menos de 5 minutos y da la apariecia de la gente que realiza un ba?o turco huele  como a un "turco" sabemos como huelen los turcos... igual a los franceses..... le tienen fobia al agua|`|btTRTkaEaa	por que lo inventaron los turcos|`|uNxjb3BIaa	por que los turcos inventaron ba?arse,,,,,,,,,,plop????

To do this, you have to find the folder in which the songs are being kept in (the easiest way is to search on "My Computer"), then go to iTunes, click "file", and go to "add folder to library". A window will open, with a list of all the folders on your computer, find your folder, and then double-click on it.<br>  After this, you have to connect your iPod to the computer, and it will appear in the left pane of iTunes. Depending on your settings, the iPod will either automatically update or you will have to click on a song, then press Ctrl + A on your keyboard (select all), and drag them onto your iPod.<br>  Now you're all ready to listen to your music!<br>  <br>  P.S. I know it may sound like a drag, but please try not to steal music. I'm not saying I don't use limewire, but I recommend using it only for the songs you can't get legally (unreleased songs, demos, remixes, etc.). Musicians work long, hard hours for their music to reach your ears, and if they aren't getting paid for it, it is simply a waste of time.

FuylrIXaaa	The secret is the perfect mix of talent and practicing. First check if you're able to sing an E6 if not it doesn't have much sense to practice and if you do it'll take years! <br>  The most importat thing is don't practise too much it can damage your voice. And believe me it's not gonna be easy and you really have to want it! My experience is, you can't change that much on the upper end of your range, but if you once hit the tones you have a chance (my range E2-E7 (I'm a girl))

Se me venía el mundo abajo, pero sin embargo, después de esa tormenta , apareció otra mujer de la cual estoy totalmente enamorado, y mi ex pasó a ser un hermoso recuerdo, pero nada más. <br>  <br>  El corazón siempre quiere volver a amar, pero teme a que lo lastimen.

Por mas que lo intentes es difícil olvidar. Si buscas a otra persona, no sería por amor, sino por intentar sustituir a la persona que se fue. Y de esa manera, vas a hacer sufrir a la otra persona y sobre todo vas a sufrir vos!! lo vas a pasar muy mal porque te estarías enga?ándote a vos misma.<br>  Mejor tomate tu tiempo, no te apresures.

There is one thing you need to understand first: there is nothing like a free movie download. Of course there are free Movie download sites, but they are illegal and you will be getting into BIG trouble using these services.<br>  <br>  But there are other sites that offer free Movie downloads that are legal. You only have to pay a onetime membership fee. After that you may download as many Movies as you can handle for the rest of your life Membership to these donwload sites is low and varies. You will have to pay around $30 for unlimited access.<br>  <br>  So once you paid your membership fee you have free Movie downloads for life. A pretty good deal and honestly... don't you think it is a good idea to stay legal?

We did the same sitting assignments, and I sat in the back.  However, 15 minutes into lesson, I let out a loud ripping fart that lasted for about 5-7 seconds!  Everyone of my classmates turned around to look at me, including the teacher! LOL  Then, for about 5 more seconds (it seemed like an eternity!), they were just looking at me!  I noticed that some of the girls were giggling.  I never felt so embarressed!  The weird thing is that afterwards, nobody commented about the farting incident!  My friend at the time pointed out the reason why: it smelled so bad in the room (it was a hot humid day... in Honlulu, Hawaii!).  LOL

e6SyWtWnaa	?cual es tu signo zodiacal? asi te podria ayudar<br>  <br>  Horóscopo Diario - Astrología Asiría:<br>   <br>  La astrología asiría o caldea, que es la de uso común en el mundo occidental, está basada en un zodíaco de doce signos astrológicos basados en los ciclos solares y divididos en cuatro diferentes grupos que se corresponden con los cuatro elementos básicos de la alquimia medieval y antigua: Fuego, Tierra, Aire y Agua. Cada uno de estos grupos contiene tres signos solares, que están influenciados por sus elementos de manera particular. <br>  <br>  Según las diferentes características de personalidad, algunos se atraerán y corresponderán entre sí más que otros, dadas las características del signo en particular.<br>  <br>  Signos de Fuego: Aries, Leo, Sagitario <br>  <br>  Signos de Tierra: Tauro, Virgo, Capricornio <br>  <br>  Signos de Aire: Géminis, Libra, Acuario <br>  <br>  Signos de Agua: Cáncer, Escorpión, Piscis <br>  <br>  La astrología basa sus predicciones en las posiciones aparentes de los cuerpos del sistema solar, usando las estrellas únicamente como puntos de referencia y tomando a la Tierra como punto central. <br>  <br>  Observados desde la Tierra los planetas y la Luna se mueven aparentemente en el mismo plano y confinados a una determinada región del firmamento, formando una cinta conocida como el zodíaco que se divide en 12 partes o signos iguales y que toman su nombre de las constelaciones.<br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado y así recibir mis puntos<br>  Au revoir<br>  Atte.

6qgWcVy8aa	it is all depended on where u are going.If you want to start off by attending youth organization gig/dances etc etc they are usually a lot more controlled and safer to be at. If you are worried then go with some friends or an adult u trust until you are more comfortable with your surroundings. Most youth events are extremely safe and I personally have been to many youth gigs [i know its not a disco but its the same idea] and have not seen any violence or anything like that.

9be6374e78d68c69f3c0e6a68f547775aa	I can hardly wait to see it! It doesn't start here until Friday (tomorrow) but I'll go this weekend for sure!<br>  <br>  John Cusack is such a fine actor that I just know I'll like it. It doesn't seem like the kind of movie that depends on gore and fake blood to get people's hearts racing; but more like it builds suspense and fear of the unknown.<br>  <br>  I'll let you know what I think after I see it.<br>  <br>  **************<br>  OK, saw it last night and loved it! Oh, yes, you MUST see 1408! I love scary movies and I loved it. It was unpredictable, suspenseful and very original.<br>  <br>  It's not gory. Some movies depend on blood and guts and gore to get an emotional reaction from the audience. No, not 1408! It scared you with the unknown, the wondering what would happen next but it wasn't gross.  But, definitely, I was gasping at parts! I mean, you could almost see people in the audience leaning forward in their seats eager to see what was going to happen next!<br>  <br>  John Cusack and Samuel Jackson gave excellent performances! And the things that happened, well, at first you're wondering if it's coincidence or truly something evil then things escalate and you're just breathless wondering what's coming next.<br>  <br>  I loved it and am recommending it to everyone. One of the best scary movies that I've ever seen!|`|8ab1eb38801c73cb34fca95faf1baa3daa	It looks awesome! I saw a sneak peek that was really freaky.

Oj33fAbWaa	i know. i've listened to endless interviews in which Brian and Roger talk about this "Not being a replacement stituation. Who can replace the irreplacable?" and i have full respect for what they're doing, and with it being somebody Freddie knew and liked. He gave them permission to continue whatever memorial schemes they had before he died, so it's not against his wishes, but, still. it's kind of painful. I can't help but dislike the whole thing, in a way, but i'm still gonna devotedly buy the album and listen to it, all the while thinking of Freddie. We shouldn't dislike it, they've only done what they can to keep Queen alive, and Freddie is on screen, singing in concerts, but it's just not the same, and never will be. And they all understand that. =[<br>  <br>  ...*sigh*<br>  <br>  i miss Freddie!|`|SztleLnUaa	I simply refuse to buy it!<br>  I heard some songs on youtube and didn't like it much.<br>  It has nothing of the Queen sound. But then, the "King" in not around any more!<br>  What I didn't like is the fact that in their recent concert in Russia, they played songs from the new album AND Queen old songs.<br>  They played Bohemian Rhapsody with Freddie on the big screen! Everybody went delirious!<br>  I feel they're using Freddie! <br>  I wonder, would people still go to see them if they knew they would play only the new stuff???|`|NwF33thlaa	I can understand the painful feeling. R.I.P. Freddie|`|T0ed2lhJaa	hi get it on paul rodgers great singer and capable of doing queens songs justice.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Let me know what you think of it, I'm a little hesitant myself to get it.<br>  <br>  Just keep reminding yourself that it is still Brian and Roger playing together.|`|WgSSu8Ddaa	It's a total let down.  They should call it a different name, because without Freddie, it's not Queen.
C7YbYUYPaa	Eh, you made me a little wary, but I'll still buy it and give it a shot.  I'm glad to hear Brian's tone is still the same, because I had heard rumors that he tried different sounds, almost like Jimmy Page's tone.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Nice review...I shall have to get it

It's so sad.  It's about how his wife and him split up and how she's on drugs and how he wishes his kids didn't have to go through that.<br>  <br>  I've never been through what he went through but some lines in the song remind me of the hard time I recently went through like "I can see your sad even when you smile, even when you laugh, I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry."  And "But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is."  And "We feel how we feel inside."  And my favorite, most true for me, "Now no more worries rest your head and go to sleep maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream."

g4hfUgRvaa	No, John McCain loves to lick ***.|`|p5dhoWO9aa	Well his right arm looks arther straight and shorter than the other one and the way his skin is pulled around his face looks slightly unnatural and i doubt a president would stick his tongue out his mouth and be in that position without obama in front of him noticing so to tell you the truth my best guess is yes most likely|`|bd5719474749e9120ac35ca84f2c494faa	I work in photoshopping and the primary thing you need to look at is hair to be able to tell. Do you see the unnatural bumps in the hair and how McCain's has no light hairs at the top, and its shaped like Obama's? That will give you your answer.|`|0dwIE5kmaa	Um...I don't know, apparently John McCain is just an a*ss*hole.  I really don't think it was photoshopped though.

I remember McCain made a funny gesture when he went the wrong way but it didn't seem quite as odd as that.  However, it happened rather quickly; but I still don't think it's been photoshopped.  There were a couple of other photos that I saw where he was caught with various expessions.<br>  <br>  Here is an article about this, with comments from the photographer:|`|6hngwo6yaa	No it isn't. I saw about three different pictures of this in the Metro (uk) newspaper, and they wouldn't put false pictures in there. So no, he's just being a douchebag.<br>  <br>  Edit: it was during some kind of a debate (I didn't read the article thorougly lol) and McCain was being a sore loser about it because Obama gave better answers.|`|fByrTmUKaa	hahaha lol, I don't know, but I couldn't resist answering this :p|`|4624eec6cde81909bd950f67a964ba76aa	No it's not, It's just one of Mccain's many crazy antics. =[<br>  |`|58eHufb3aa	Yes|`|NJfpY7nIaa	Yes, it is.|`|LhDde5iBaa	Somehow I doubt it.|`|hpb7uO6faa	i dont think it is

They get caught up chatting and next thing they know it's really late.<br>  <br>  Try calling her, try her friends (if you have their numbers - if not, after this is a good time to get some).  If she is not home in 30 mins, call your parents (if possible ) - they can decide what is best to do.  If you are worried about getting her in to trouble, stop.  That time has passed.  After your parents, the next option is the police.<br>  <br>  I know you are worried, but she is probably fine.  Let her see this when she gets in so that she will know how much her thoughtlessness has worried you.<br>  <br>  How old are you?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm glad to see that she got home ok!  Get the numbers of a couple of close friends from her to prevent this happening again.|`|YOtvoUzfaa	Just try calling her. At least then you can say you tried. Text her, and leave a message on the voicemail.<br>  <br>  Also, call your other family, parents, other siblings, etc. Ask them if they know where she is.<br>  <br>  If not, just let time wear on. If she doesn't show up, start calling her friends and ask if they know where she might be.|`|NNBpLbL9aa	Chill out, she probably got detention or is out with her friends, just relax!

If not tell them she isn't home and they can help..<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  |`|5ehjYRX8aa	its normal to be worried, the best thing you could do is to report the incident to the school, they could also have an idea to where your sister might be. talk to your parents about it, as well as your sister's friends.|`|OENmWil2aa	ring her!!

Im sure she'll come home in the end|`|hRn0xpeTaa	don't panic because its the worse thing to do but dont dont be relaxed about it either. just phone and call her friends im sure everything is going to be alright  |`|cwVKyIa3aa	Most likely she is with her friends.

Inicialmente fue vocalista del grupo The Sugarcubes, para después emprender una carrera en solitario. Es característica por su gran rango expresivo y un interés a una gran variedad de géneros como el pop, rock alternativo, trip-hop, jazz, electrónica, folk y música clásica. Según su compa?ía de discos One Little Indian, Bj?rk ha vendido más de 15 millones de copia<br>  Bj?rk nació en el barrio de Oslin, Reikiavik. Su madre es Hildur Rúna Hauksdóttir, una conocida ecologista en Islandia y su padre, Guemundur Gunnarson, un electricista. Sus padres se separaron cuando Bj?rk tenía dos a?os. Su padrastro, Sv?var árnason, guitarrista del grupo local Pops y conocido como "el Eric Clapton islandés", la alentó a estudiar música y componer.<br>  <br>  A la edad de tres a?os empezó a cantar piezas del musical The Sound of Music (Sonrisas y lágrimas, La novicia rebelde)<br>  <br>  Tras el nacimiento de su hermano árnar (Bj?rk tiene en total seis hermanos, tres de ellos varones), la familia se mudó a Breieholt, en las afueras de Reikiavik para llevar un estilo de vida hippie.<br>  <br>  Desde peque?a Bj?rk mostró un fuerte interés por las ciencias naturales y la física, coleccionaba insectos y sus ídolos eran Albert Einstein y el antropólogo británico David Attenborough.<br>  <br>  Su infancia estuvo expuesta a las influencias de diferentes estilos musicales como el rock de Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin y Eric Clapton, por parte de su padrastro, así como Simon & Garfunkel, por parte de Hildur y la música clásica y el jazz por parte de abuelos.<br>  <br>  A los nueve a?os estaba interesada en el dúo estadounidense Sparks cuyo disco Kimono My House, junto al álbum Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, de los Beatles se convierten en sus primeras adquisiciones discográficas. Para este momento también demuestra interés por los hermanos Johny y Edgar Winter.<br>  Su carrera musical comenzó a la edad de once a?os cuando en una fiesta escolar interpretó la canción de Tina Charles "I Love To Love" y uno de sus instructores envió la grabación a Radio One, una emisora de radio de Islandia. La grabación fue transmitida por todo el país; al escucharla un representante de la compa?ía discográfica Skífan se puso en contacto con los padres de Bj?rk, pero al ver que la compa?ía no ofrecía las garantías deseadas, firmaron con Fálkinn. Con la ayuda de su padrastro en guitarra junto a Bj?rgvin Gíslason, Pálmi Gunnarson en el bajo y Sigurdur Karlsson en batería, grabó en 1977 su primer álbum, llamado escuetamente Bj?rk, el cual contenía una selección de covers en islandés de canciones de artistas como los Beatles y Stevie Wonder, así como también temas de composición.<br>  <br>  Las primeras bandas [editar]<br>  <br>  La música punk empezó a tener una influencia sobre Bj?rk; a los catorce a?os creó una banda de punk íntegramente femenina con el nombre de Spit and Snot, un precedente de la ideología riot grrl, pero más independente. "?Teníamos canciones de verdad! Y estábamos muy cansadas de las feministas negativas que siempre se estaban compadeciendo y lamentándose".<br>  <br>  En Spit and Snot, Bj?rk ocupó el lugar de batería. Brevemente le siguió una banda de jazz de fusión llamada Exodus en 1979 en la que se encontraban ásgeir S?mundsson y Torvaldur Torvalsson con los que logró una grabación casera y una aparición en la televisión islandesa, el tipo de música de Exodus era básicamente punk con elementos pop. La banda que le siguió fue Jam-80, pero su duración fue muy breve ya que solamente dieron una sola presentación. En 1980, a la edad de quince a?os, se graduó de la escuela de música como pianista clásica, siendo la única alumna en completar el curso de 10 a?os.<br>  <br>  En 1981 junto al ex-bajista de Exodus Jakob Magnússon formaron otra banda, Tappi Tíkarrass (en islandés significa "Tapona el Culo de la Zorra"), y lanzaron un álbum en 1982 con el título de Bítie Fast í Vítie. Su álbum Miranda fue lanzado en 1983.<br>  El grupo desarrolló un estilo after-punk con referencias a Siouxsie and the Banshees y la primera etapa de The Cure.<br>  <br>  Bj?rk entró en otra banda en 1983. Después de componer y ensayar por dos semanas se presentaron con el nombre de KUKL ("Hechicero", en islandés). Aunque el estilo de KUKL era de un tipo de rock gótico oscuro con el estilo de Killing Joke y referencias vanguardistas del after-punk de The Fall. Bj?rk lo definiría más tarde, no sin humor, como "jazz-punk-hardcore existencial".<br>  <br>  Mientras realizaban una gira en Islandia se presentaron con la banda británica Crass, y visitaron posteriormente el Reino Unido en una serie de presentaciones con Flux of Pinks Indians.<br>  <br>  Para ese momento Bj?rk había estado saliendo con el guitarrista Tór Eldon Jónsson y estaba embarazada, por lo que el ajetreado estilo de vida de KUKL se convirtió en una tarea muy intensa.<br>  <br>  La banda se separa y Bj?rk acompa?a a Gulli óttarsson bajo el nombre de The Elgar Sisters, nombre adoptado en honor al compositor clásico Edward Elgar.<br>  Grabaron 11 canciones para un álbum, pero éste quedó en la nada. Mientras tanto, en el verano boreal de 1986 varios miembros de KUKL dieron lugar a la formación de The Sugarcubes, con la excepción de óttarsson. .<br>  <br>  The Sugarcubes [editar]<br>  <br>  El 8 de junio de 1986 Bj?rk dio a luz a Sindri Eldon Tórsson, fecha que también es citada como el nacimiento oficial de Sykurmolarnir que finalmente sería traducida a su equivalente en inglés: The Sugarcubes (“Los Terrones de Azúcar”). Para ese momento Einar ?rn y Tór Eldon estaban al frente de una nueva organización llamada Smekkleysa u oficialmente conocida como Bad Taste, un sello discográfico contracultural que fomentaba el trabajo artístico de jóvenes islandeses. Brevemente después del nacimiento de Sindri, Bj?rk tuvo un papel en la película The Juniper Tree (1987) y dos a?os más tarde, Bj?rk y Tór se separan, pero siguieron siendo amigos.<br>  <br>  También en 1987 participó de Glerbrot, una obra de Matthias Johannsen para la televisión islandesa, interpretó a una adolescente conflictiva. Para el mismo a?o, la hermana de Bj?rk, Inga Hr?nn, participó de la banda de new wave Blatt Afram que solamente grabó dos canciones en su único álbum en formato cassette lanzado con el nombre de Snarl 2.<br>  <br>  El primer single de los Sugarcubes Am?li (Birthday, en su versión al inglés), se convirtió en un gran éxito en Inglaterra, dejando una buena impresión con el surrealismo expresado con la letra y el extravagante concepto sonoro general.<br>  <br>  Melodie Maker es el medio más entusiasta eligiendo a Birthday como single de la semana y agregando comentarios halagadores de su arquitectura sonora. Otros medios también presentaron a los Sugarcubes en portada, como New Musical Express y la desaparecida Sounds.<br>  <br>  La suerte de los Sugarcubes empieza a decaer cuando en 1989 lanzaron su segundo álbum llamado Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week!, título que proviene de una frase del libro El viento en los sauces, de Kenneth Graeme.<br>  <br>  Mientras que el éxito de los Sugarcubes iba decayendo, Bj?rk participó en otros proyectos adicionales: bajo el nombre de Betula Jónasson tocó el clarinete en Hljómsveit Konráes B (La Banda de Konráe B, en islandés), grupo derivado de Caviare, el dúo de Siggi Baldursson y Magga ?rnólfsdóttir.<br>  <br>  En 1990 grabó Gling-Gló, una colección de jazz popular y trabajo original con el grupo de música bebop que se dio a conocer como Bj?rk Guemundsdóttir & Tríó Guemundar Ingólfssonar, lanzado en Islandia.<br>  <br>  El grupo se desvaneció poco después del lanzamiento del álbum, cuando el pianista Guemundur Ingólfsson muere de cáncer; también contribuyó como vocalista para la grabación de "Ooops" y "Qmart", pertenecientes al álbum Ex:El de la banda 808 State, al mando de Graham Massey; una colaboración que cultivó su interés en la música house. Mientras tanto, The Sugarcubes queda en un periodo de inactividad.<br>  <br>  The Sugarcubes vuelven a reunirse en Nueva York junto al productor Paul Fox para preparar su próximo álbum Stick Around For Joy, que fue editado en febrero de 1992 y precedido por el single “Hit”. Stick Around For Joy es el álbum más famoso con el cual Bj?rk se daría a conocer definitivamente en la escena musical británica, pero a pesar del éxito alcanzado, las tensiones aumentaron entre Bj?rk y Einar ?rn y para finales de ese a?o, sale a la venta un álbum con remixes titulado It's-It, el último lanzamiento antes de que la banda se separe.<br>  <br>  Después de la separación de los Sugarcubes, Bj?rk se mudó a Londres y comenzó a pensar cómo seguir con su carrera solista desde cero: “Decidí poner en marcha mi propio proyecto y, para eso, cada detalle tenía que ser perfecto. Como yo soy mi propia manager y todo tiene que hacerse con mi nombre, era ridículo hacerlo desde Islandia. Siempre estaba con el teléfono y el fax. No es que vaya de perfeccionista, pero tener gente realmente profesional que te resuelva problemas te quita un peso importante de encima; te simplifica las cosas. Gente que sepa exactamente lo que hay que hacer. Muy buenos dise?adores gráficos, bajos, ingenieros de sonido..., allí puedes encontrar de todo”.<br>  <br>  Con este fin, empezó a trabajar con el productor Nellee Hooper (ex-Soul II Soul), quien ya había producido para Massive Attack, entre otros. De su colaboración surgió el primer hit solista a nivel internacional de Bj?rk: el hi-tech de "Human Behaviour". lo siento por ser tan larga esta converzacion pero espero que no quieras saber mas de este grupo, un saludo frank p|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	es cantante<br>  pero es rara|`|drGDrpncaa	es una dj , hace canciones , y tambien canta en sus canciones , son raras|`|e1c7c24eae123e54f653f58a9c7ac4e7aa	Bj?rk Guemundsdóttir (*Reykjavík, Islandia, 21 de noviembre de 1965) es una cantante, compositora y actriz ocasional islandesa.

So many clients want to get to this card so fast, that they tend to get annoyed with the Tarot reader for not getting right to it. These particular clients should have probably opted for the One Card Yes or No spread. That one tells them right away if what they want is going to happen or not.<br>  <br>  The Future card is exactly what it says. It shows where the client’s future is headed on a given path. As many Tarot readers will tell their clients, the future is not set in stone. If you are not happy with where it seems to be heading, simply change the present. Doing so will change the future. Therefore, the rest of the cards in a Five Card spread are just as important as the Tarot card showing up in the Future position. Having taken the information from the cards in the Past, Present, Hidden Influences, Advice positions, the Future tarot card meaning is revealed last. If you were to simply skip over the rest of these cards in a Tarot reading, and go straight to the Future or Outcome card, the client may be very confused. If the outcome is not what the client was hoping it would be, the next question is going to be “WHY?” This is the very reason that a reading must be complete, and explained in order of the cards’ positions. The rest of the Tarot card meanings will explain why the outcome is predicted the way it is. The important thing to understand about the Tarot card in the Future position is that it does not have to be the FINAL outcome. It is simply showing the client where things are headed at that particular point in time. If the suggested Future is not what is desired, show the client what can be changed to alter the current outcome. An example of this is a young woman coming to you for a reading. She is making plans to be married and insists she is happier than she has ever been in her life. However, her cards suggest otherwise. The Future card shows that this marriage is headed for disaster in a very short time. Upon hearing this, she admits she has serious doubts but others keep telling her it is the right thing for her to do. By simply taking control of her life again, she can avoid this unhappy future. That is what the tarot card meaning in the Future position is really all about. It is to show you where you are headed right now, today, if nothing changes. The future can be changed if your client pays attention to the rest of the cards in the reading.<br>  <br>  What is going against you ? High Priestess - Intuition. Spiritual/occult knowledge. Psychic impressions. Significant dreams. Wise counsel. Guidance from a higher Source. Advice from an intuitive person.<br>  <br>  Outcome: Strength - Passion. The instinctual nature. Taming of primal energies. Making friends with one's "animal" nature. Strong drives and emotions. One's natural faculties are a source of strength. <br>  <br>  Love & Blessings<br>  Milly|`|2bZWS8sSaa	Hello Andrew<br>  <br>  Considering that the reading was via a professional, then yes you can still change outcomes.  <br>  <br>  Outcomes tend to be predictable when the individual isn't willing to try a new route to success.

Put your faith in God!|`|MjrhZsg5aa	I read the Tarot and agree with milly_1963, future outcomes are just "possible" future outcomes. They are what may happen based on what is happening in your life right now. <br>  Nothing is set in stone. Nothing is concrete. <br>  <br>  You never lack any control over your life.<br>  <br>  Like milly_1963 said, Tarot is based on the Future, the Past, and the Present. I perceive the Tarot was being a tool of insight. It can keep a person from going down that road that could possibly lead to the future. <br>  However, you are obviously upset. So, screw the future outcome that was told to you. You don't need that power of suggestion.<br>  Now, what I do want you to look at though is what was told to you about the past and the present. I want you to critically think about those two things. <br>  After your done thinking, you should have a clearer mind and a better understanding of the past and present. Then you can come up with several future scenarios good and/or bad based off of the insights you gleaned. (If bad scenarios apply you do need them to help keep you away from past/present bad habits or what have you.) <br>  Then you can pick the future scenario you want for yourself and strive for that. |`|o5eIOwovaa	Take it with a grain of salt, remember - they can't guarantee anything other than entertainment value from a tarot reading!<br>  <br>  The only control you'll ever have over your life is dependent entirely on your dedication and involvement.|`|Pe0qocHdaa	 No card controls you destiny.

UEBY1kmDaa	A prioris, oui un petit peu car avant d'écrire ce qu'on conna?t de la série actuellement, ils avaient au début, écris que trois épisodes; puis voyant que cela captiver les gens ils ont décidés de continuer, ne sachant pas ce qu'ils allaient faire subir aux personnages et ne connaissant pas le but final de la série. Comme la fin de la deuxième ou troisième saison je ne sais plus, où les survivants découvrent une trape, à ce moment précis de l'écriture du scénario, les auteurs ne savaient absolument pas ce qu'ils allaient trouvés dans cette trape, ils improvisent et ?a marche puisqu'on ne sait toujours pas comment cela va se terminer !

aa9c17e219a24be4086401e747b787e4aa	Assisti o anime pela RedeTV e tive a oportunidade de ler algumas edi??es do mangá on-line, mas, só pelo pouco que li, deu pra ver que Yoshihiro Togashi n?o ficou devendo em nada a Yu Yu Hakusho! Se tinha gente que criticava YYH dizendo que era "só luta o tempo todo" e n?o tinha história, Hunter x Hunter tem um dos enredos mais interessantes e cativantes que eu já vi. Sem falar do Genen Hyodan, o grupo de vil?es mais animal que já apareceu nos animes! Deixa a Jupongatana de Shishio em "Samurai X" no chinelo!! Os principais, ent?o, nem se fala! Putz, e eu que pensava que Kurama era o cara mais inteligente dos desenhos japoneses... Isso até conhecer Kurapaika! O loirinho daria uma surra no próprio Shun de Andr?meda, no que se refere à manipula??o de correntes! Olha, até hoje, Yu Yu sempre foi o meu anime/mangá preferido de todos os tempos. Mas, se tá saindo o mangá de HxH, ent?o, vou esperar pra ler esse também e aí eu te conto minha opini?o definitiva.|`|uyrLwts2aa	No mangá a história tem um andamento melhor, se vc viu o anime vera algumas mudan?as, para melhor na minha opini?o, sem falar que no mangá a história continua, tem muita coisa ainda por vir que vc n?o viu no anime, recomendo.<br>  E os personagens est?o longe de serem chatos e haistória tem bom andamento, n?o dá paradas de enrola??o|`|9e138eb513f67c64393b1bb157f752b5aa	O mangá eu n?o sei, mas o anime eu gostei muito, gon é um personagem bem carismático, na primeira parte o anime é meio básico, mas depois que ele vira hunter come?a a ficar bem legal o anime.|`|zWxN838oaa	O anime eu assisti...é bacaninha, mas fiquei indignado com o final hehehe
v45UHYRKaa	Oi,<br>  <br>  Se trata de uma comédia light e seu grande trunfo é a estonteante Catherine Zeta-Jones, que aliás, trabalhou durante um dia inteiro no restaurante Fiamma Osteria, de Nova York, como forma de se preparar para o papel.  A bela Catherine está atuando cada vez melhor. Bom filme.<br>  <br>  Assista! Mas assista também o original, "Simplesmente Martha", mas, por favor n?o fa?a compara??es. Penso que s?o filmes "diferentes!"<br>  Eu, pessoalmente, prefiro o original alem?o. Mas isto sou eu que sou chato. Talvez você venha gostar mais da refilmagem americana.<br>  Para ajudá-la entender as diferen?as, indico-lhe o link abaixo onde o excelente texto de Lívia Vilela nos esclarece as duas vers?es.<br>  <br>  Omelete (Coluna de Lívia Vilela)<br>  <a href="http://www.omelete.com.br/cine/100007288/Sem_Reservas.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.omelete.com.br/cine/100007288...</a><br>  <br>  Mas o bom mesmo é assistir os dois, porque nós temos direito a isso! Muito embora Lívia aconselhe para quem vá assistir a refilmagem n?o assistir o original. Bem, isto foi a única coisa que n?o concordei com ela.<br>  <br>  Sem Reservas (2007)<br>  <a href="http://epipoca.uol.com.br/filmes_detalhes.php?idf=12873" rel="nofollow">http://epipoca.uol.com.br/filmes_detalhe...</a><br>  <br>  Simplesmente Martha, (2001)<br>  <a href="http://epipoca.uol.com.br/filmes_detalhes.php?idf=4583" rel="nofollow">http://epipoca.uol.com.br/filmes_detalhe...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  é isso aí!|`|HKFXwyUAaa	dalila,<br>  se vc ainda nao assistiu assista é muito bom.<br>  gostei muito do filme.<br>  <br>  com um elenco muito bom , com catherine zeta johnes que pra mim e uma das mais lindas atrizes internacionais. <br>  o filma foi passado de maneira errada aqui no brasil , ele foi divulgado como uma comedia romantica, mas nao e bem assim.<br>  o filme mistura drama com comedia , numa dosagem muito boa.<br>  <br>  e passa uma mensagem muito bonita sim.<br>  mostra que a gente tem que da valor a vida da gente, fazer o que realmente gosta e nao viver aprisionado ao que esta programado pra gente.<br>  as vezes temos esse poder de mudar nossas vidas e nao fazemos.<br>  qtas vezes tivemos a chance de optar por dois caminhos , e as vezes pegamos o caminho errado? o filme fala sobre isso tambem.<br>  e mostra o quanto a nossa vida muda qdo acontece uma pequena coisa.<br>  <br>  enfim, vale muito a pena ser visto .|`|a72a1182c7ce63ca15042a922b8e20f0aa	Que é isso? filme porn?? mas....a essas horas?|`|77746892caf67f0e30b79716e5b09c6caa	eu gostei muito, apesar de n?o ser exatamente uma comédia romantica porque existem muitas cenas "dramáticas"
13501b1e2dcdaac5927f6c7b0a422621aa	O filme eh muito bom! Tem suspense, a??o, e o melhor, nem tem violencia gratuita, nem aqueles litros de sangue escorrendo tela abaixo! Nicole ta linda e otima no papel de superm?e, apesar do errinho q vi, ela de  meia-cal?a branca numa cena e preta em outra, mas um mero detalhe. Recomendo.

zk3hRk4naa	Só assisti "Quebrando a Banca" (21, no original e que me soa bem menos "mexicano") dos três mencionados. No geral, eu acho que o filme leva 7 pontos de 10.<br>  <br>  N?o é um filme que faz pensar ou surpreende demais pelo enredo, mas diverte bastante - pelo menos, é um filme que deixa alguns clichés de lado, algo que eu considero refrescante no cinema. As atua??es foram boas na sua maioria, o enredo prendeu a aten??o e, o principal para mim, divertiu. N?o é algo muito profundo (ao que parece, o enfoque do livro que originou o filme vai mais além nesse aspecto) ou marcante, mas é uma boa op??o para o final de semana.<br>  <br>  Em suma, recomendo.|`|0chl1yrqaa	Eu vi na pré-estréia o "quebrando a banca".<br>  Gostei bastante! ele prende a aten??o e é muito interessante, e é baseado em fatos reais.<br>  Procura as sinopses dos filmes.|`|QV69YwMDaa	Assisti apenas "Quebrando a Banca", o qual é muito chato e parece filme  da sess?o da tarde. O filme n?o tem nada de mais, com certeza, n?o vai se tornar um clássico, n?o passa de  mais um filme chato e repetitivo da nova safra de  filmes...

So, if you asked 10 minutes ago, they post it with all the other 10-minutes-ago questions.  In Polls & Surveys, that's death because so many questions are asked, and hardly anybody spends time flipping pages to get to the older questions.

Por otra parte, sería muy difícil que a su vez, Jennifer lo perdonara y regresará con él después de lo que le hizo. <br>  Así, que lo mejor es que Jennifer encuentre a alguien que valga la pena y con quien también forme una familia; aunque lamentablemente dudo que pueda encontrar a un hombre tan guapo, talentoso y carismático como Brad Pitt. ?No crees?|`|Uusus5fBaa	si ellos eran la pareja perfecta se complementaban mutuamente... pero bueno angelina se lo quito a jenifer :(|`|fru6PKjTaa	ojala que no, porque aunque eran la pareja mas tierna<br>  <br>  Brad hiso algo terrible al irse con angelina y mas encima procrearon a shilo antes de divorciarse con jen.|`|61560a4a5a0bda07e5e37976b28d915aaa	Pues la verdad no lo creo, pero de que me gustaria que regresaran eso que ni que<br>  <br>  SALUDOS|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	no creo que ella no lo va a perdonar ni en 1000 a?os y ademas necesita un novio nuevo porque ese que tiene tiene un pasado como adicto alas drogas y fue acusado de asesinato <br>  <br>  <br>  asi que esa jennifer debe ser mas cuidadosa con los novios k elige

I never used to know that much about politics, also I didn't care at that moment since I'm not of voting age.  But in grade 10 Civics, we learned about politics and it's actually pretty interesting.  And we have some interesting debates and discussions.<br>  <br>  I live in Canada, but personally, I'm for Obama.  I find Sarah Palin to be an idiot, as is Bush.  Not for any particular reason, they're just not too bright and not fit to run (or help run) a country.  Plus, McCain is old and will probably drop dead tomorrow.|`|uLqLS5ntaa	well, it was in fifth grade. i just kind of made myself a democrat. i was so enthusiastic and i would watch all the debates. i remember how sad i was when kerry didn't win.. haha<br>  <br>  <br>  i still love politics. i'm crazy about it.. i guess cause i was good in civics in eighth grade. <br>  <br>  OBAMA 08 :). haha.. my bff is for McCain.. it's actually funny cause we argue sometimes.. :) but honestly i don't care if my friends are republican or democrats. |`|Um79JB1naa	When I was out of my teens, but partly because the hideous Clintons were in power for a big chunk of my life and I tried not to think about them.<br>  <br>  Good for you and may you continue to dig in!|`|1044e6d5b5224a0e60d20aab5815ba06aa	I'm 33 and still believe that on a tax form if your a politician you should have put career  criminal down as your profession  |`|Ax8t2f4kaa	Umm this year.. 13. :]] <br>  <br>  because this world is dieing..

Last year it was just over a $1000. Its my fault for spoiling her when she was young. I just wanted her to be happy and buying things made her happy. Now she's 15 and not slowing down on the gifts. Its not as fun as it use to be. Now all she wants is clothes and clothes and more clothes. Her friends love her clothes but she say's no there crap. So now I gotta run my visa back up so she can have the clothes she wants.  I can't even remember what I received when I was 15, I just know it wasn't a lot. I was also on my own at 17 and didn't have a bunch of gifts under the tree. I'm sure my daughter will want lots of gifts until I'm with GOD.|`|35f24b2af8a7ad84a7fcca13e0466ad7aa	Kinda, I bought it all out in America cause I knew it would be cheaper.

Carlos et Gabrielle vont divorcer. Et Gabrielle va recoucher avec John qui ai devenu un grand homme d'affaire et va épouser une femme. Tom passe beaucoup de temps avec sa fille qu'il a retrouvé et Nora exaspere Lynette.|`|YCUMwVdoaa	JE NE C PA VIVE MEN LA SAISON 3|`|azMmafOLaa	parceque mike apres s'etre reveiller de coma a repris sa memoire et il se rapel ke orson a tuer sa femme: monique poulier! donc il veut le tuer avant qu'il ne le denonce a la police ou a bree.|`|iAIjuT1Saa	tout simplement, parce que mike sait quelque chose sur orson, il l'a vu chez une personne qui a été tuée !<br>  <br>  j'ai fini de voir la saison 3, mais on ne sait toujours pas si il y aurait pas autre chose ! car on sait toujours pas vraiment pourquoi orson a voulu écraser mike, personne ne le sait encore dans la série, même pas mike !<br>  <br>  je donne un mauvais point à ceux qui répondent à c?té et raconte tout sur la 3 ème saison !|`|osY0uP4Zaa	apparemment ils se sont connus plus t?t mais mike ne s'en souviens pas. Encore un règlement de compte!!! Vivement la saison 3!<br>  <br>  Et non, mike ne meurt pas!|`|8UK9ihrbaa	A ne pas lire si vous ne voulez pas savoir...<br>  <br>  <br>  En fait, le truc c'est qu'Orson a une femme qui s'appelle Alma. Mais cette femme, il ne l'a pas vraiment choisi, c'est plutot sa mere qui l'aimait bien et elles ont complotées toutes les 2, fait croire qu'elle était enceinte pour se faire épouser. <br>  <br>  Mais Orson n'aimait pas cette femme et donc quand elle a disparu, on a cru que c'était lui qui l'avait zigouillé mais en fait elle est parti de son plein gré !<br>  <br>  Et donc Orson avait une aventure avec Monique. Et cette Monique a appelé Mike un soir pour un problème de plomberie mais il lui manquait une pièce et est partie la chercher. En revenant, Monique était plus là, mais Orson si et  Monique était morte à ses pieds mais derrière la cuisine.<br>  <br>  Mais là, vous croyez donc que c'est Orson qui a tué la Momo mais nooon ! c'est la mère d'Orson ! Celle qui est actuellement en maison de fou. <br>  <br>  Mais bon, Bree va trouver sa moche et va vouloir la sortir de cet établissement. Puis Alma, la femme que tout le monde croyait morte va revenir pour récupérer Orson...<br>  <br>  Mais donc pour répondre à ta question, Orson, pour protéger sa mère ou plut?t lui même de peur que Mike ne le reconnaisse (car Mike n'a pas vu la mère d'Orson dans la maison) il a voulu le tuer.<br>  <br>  Voilà, j'avais prévenu, fallait pas lire si vous ne vouliez pas savoir !|`|YlZ3IQRKaa	pck mike l'avait vu dans la maison de monique.|`|VqbEzCJDaa	Attends la saison 3 cocotte<br>  <br>  @pauline: merci moi aussi j'aime pas attendre :-)|`|gNNMwLQFaa	non il est pas mort il est dans le coma<br>  voici quelque site pour voir la saison 3:<br>  <a href="http://gigistudio.over-blog.com/article-4252744.html" rel="nofollow">http://gigistudio.over-blog.com/article-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.every-series.com/index.php?page=idesperate" rel="nofollow">http://www.every-series.com/index.php?pa...</a><br>  <br>  pour télécharger:<br>  <a href="http://youtube.over-blog.fr/article-11784505.html" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.over-blog.fr/article-1178...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.abc-divx.net/content/view/2631/83/1/1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc-divx.net/content/view/263...</a>

A03NJA26aa	Well there were bodies all around town that were in everyday positions but they were dead. This artist who had been rejected by another artist knocked his victims unconscious and then put them in a CO2 chamber to die in the position they were found. on a park bench, by a lamp post in a park and standing in the woods. The last victim was a boy that the new CSI Riley saved at the end. She was o.k.for a new character.  A grief counselor (played by ER's Alex Kingston) was there to talk to everyone about Warrick but only a few chose to talk about it. greg being one of them. that was basically it. a few funny moments occurred. David didn't realize the body was dead that was standing up in the park and he started talking to her! |`|0a71d76dfa1ab1ac5d93f86e92f2f955aa	Your best bet for a recap is the Internet Movie Database, <a href="http://us.imdb.com," rel="nofollow">http://us.imdb.com,</a> careful, there's spoilers if you plan on going to CBS.com to watch it.<br>  <br>  CBS.com usually has it about a day or so after it airs.<br>  <br>  
sCca9IApaa	<a href="http://www.animenation.net/forums/archive/index.php/t-193911.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenation.net/forums/archiv...</a><br>  <br>  Lol, not a tutorial, but they mention some good links and stuff ^^<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Sand Village sandals (those worn by Gaara, Temari and Kankuro) are different from the sandals the other villages wear. There are 4 differences they all share:<br>  <br>  1. Sand sandals are black, not blue.<br>  2. Sand sandals have no heel cuff.<br>  3. Sand sandals have no toe cuff.<br>  4. Sand sandals have a toe thong.<br>  <br>  Basically, do not cut the toe thong off the flip-flips, you need to leave it on. Instead of forming a toe cuff with the front of the shoe, just trim the fabric about 1" out from the thong, fold it over, pin it and stitch. After you've glued the bottom of the shoe to the sole, glue or hand stitch the front of the shoe directly to the top of the toe thong. Other than that, all you need to do is make sure you don't make the extra heel cuff.<br>  <br>  Additionally, Kankuro's sandals are different in that his shoes are open at the top and have no cuff, making his the easiest to make of all.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------Quote:<br>  <br>  There are several ways you can make a kick **** fan. One way I thought was taking rigid materials and manipulating them to your likeing. <br>  <br>  First thing you need to come up with is whether you want it to fold in or always stay out. ((AKA folding out like the images above all the time.)<br>  <br>  TO have it folded out all the time This might be a good way to take on the task. <br>  <br>  I would probably use double Ply foam or presentation board. You want the fan to be decently light so its easy to carry! Its also strong enough to stay stiff and not. <br>  <br>  There are two ways you can think of the fan. You can keep it flat or actually have demension to it. I prefer demension just cause it adds something to it. I would definitely practice making a fan out of paper and figure out how many folds you want and how big you want it to your body. In the anime the fan is big enough to allow her to sit on it and glide. I would use a person as a reference to the actual size of the fan. <br>  <br>  Once you figure that out with the knowledge of the folds cut strips of the board or stiff form and when you glue them make sure that they add demension Like if you looked at it from the top of the fan it would look like this ^^^^^^^^. <br>  <br>  Once the fan is complete you will find that it looks funkeh. Now on the outside it may not look so good. Heres what I would do. I would use the cheap cotton weave you can get for two dollars a yard. The cheap stuff. Its durable, but comes in so many bright colors! I would then either sew a cover for it or glue the fabric to the board fan. <br>  <br>  Now a problem might arise. I have honestly never glued fabric to board (if i needed something stiff with nice colors I would sew them tight enough to fit on the accessory). I would have a scrap piece of your board and a scrap piece of your fabric. There are many varieties of glue you can use to glue it. With your scrap pieces test out the best one. From what I found 3Mm Super 77 is the best for glueing fabric to other flat stiff mediums ( I researched it online). Do NOT use glue you think will buckle or wrinkle. This includes emlers. A spray glue will be the best. But when you use it make sure your in a well ventilated area or outside. THe fumes can kILL! Also make sure the glue gets on ONLY what you want too! Three to four layers should be plenty but let me tell ya the stuff gets sticky really really fast. So being careful and well planned helps! <br>  <br>  Now a better fan would be to make one that looks authentic and functionable and that folds in an out. I have seen people who make them out of wood and what not. Which is something that might be kind of hard. However they might sell that ply wood or the really soft wood in order to cut it and make something but I dont think it would be durable enough for a large fan. Wood making is hard unless you know someone who knows how to cut them accurately and what not, sand them, and polish them too. <br>  <br>  There is an alternative though. I messed around for a couple hours to figure out how to make one so you would have it. I made a little picture diagram. If you actually have a paper fan it will help you to understand how fans work. :) If anything... You can always buy a small one to see how it works. Hopefully though my diagram will help you. <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v340/jamiesama/Untitled-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v340/j...</a><br>  <br>  In the long run though you can just by enough material to make a marterial fan and have nice wood ends that attach to fabric.<br>  <br>  I tried to search for places you could get fans and honestly I think your going to have to make one. I hope this helps and if you have any questions about anything costume wise let me know ill try to help! :D and that goes for everyone. <br>  <br>  Lesseeeee Material for her costume. Which one are you going to do? I like to sometimes mix materials so it adds a flare. Obviously you might need fishnet. Leg avenue from costume stores and Buycostumes.com will help a LOT! They have a lot different kinds of styles and costume stores also have the fishnet and what not. <br>  <br>  I wouldnt go so fancy. I would use a nice cotton or even linen. Sometimes using some softer materials will make it look nice! Cotton again comes in ALOT of colors. :D Trimming I am sure you can mix and match with satin and other fine materials. <br>  <br>  Her white outfit I would go with cotton. I would go fancier for her blue out fit . I would use cotton for the white bust part and satin double sided ribbon for the halter part of it. Heck even really nice rop strip out of vinyl or something would look good too. Underneathe I would definitely use satin. teh HOTTNESS! XD THe red Wasit cloth I would have fun with too. Maybe satin, cotton, or a type of chiffon or taffeta or something. :D Be creative. The choice for a cosplay costume really makes a difference if you have a vision for the use of materials. Material on a costume can make it or break it. Get some fabric swatches from your local material stores and mix and match them to figure some things out and what not. :) <br>  <br>  <br>  Again I hope this helped"<br>  <br>  Unquote:<br>  <br>  I hope I helped, too!!

When you have a series go on and on it tends to die, for example you have Naruto which i personally like but its very long and as it goes on they loose fans people get annoyed and so on. The same with Inuyash which eventually was just the same thing over and over and thats why people don't like it while on the other hand you have shows like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun where you have a story that goes through like a big movie and then finishes. Full Metal Alchemist was pretty long but it was still a great anime because it still had a story that came to an end.|`|XNIkS3KNaa	Try:<br>  Innocent Venus- 12 eps<br>  <br>  Devil May Cry- 12 eps<br>  <br>  Cowboy Bebop- 26 eps and 1 movie<br>  <br>  Trigun- 26 eps<br>  <br>  S-cry-ed- 26 eps<br>  <br>  Witch Hunter Robin- 26 eps<br>  <br>  Bus Gamer- 3 eps<br>  <br>  Loveless- 12 eps, shounen-ai<br>  <br>  Gravitation- 13 eps, shounen-ai<br>  <br>  Gakuen Heaven- 13 eps, shounen-ai<br>  <br>  .Hack//Sign- 26 eps<br>  <br>  Elemental Gelade- 26 eps<br>  <br>  Peacemaker- 25 eps<br>  <br>  Outlaw Star- 26 eps<br>  <br>  Trinity Blood- 24 eps<br>  <br>  Samurai Deeper Kyo- 26 eps<br>  <br>  Chrono Crusade- 24 eps<br>  <br>  Wolf's Rain- 26 eps<br>  <br>  Black Cat- 24 eps<br>  <br>  To watch:<br>  <a href="http://www.animekiosk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.animekiosk.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crunchyroll.com</a><br>  <a href="http://revolution-anime.co.nr" rel="nofollow">http://revolution-anime.co.nr</a><br>  <a href="http://www.veoh.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.veoh.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com</a><br>  <br>  The list can go on forever, sadly there are a lot of great animes that are short for no reason. :(  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped some. :)|`|EVMoD9bKaa	Fullmetal Alchemist is 51 episodes, not too short, and it was maybe as great as Elfen Lied.

Something like Protoculture in Robotech.|`|9wBwoDkqaa	have some dramatic scenes|`|fMwuupaqaa	You could put some interesting plots, like your main character need that substance to keep him alive (maybe he is a mutant sentinel and his metabolism needs that substance to keep healthy) but he fights for himself and his path get connected with rebellion on earth against Havok.<br>  Havok could be a military organization made by robots, cyborgs and mutants, and rebel army are basic men and women?<br>  If you need some artwork and ideas I could help you out.|`|vVjqM17maa	u should have a romance in the middle of it =)     lol

hqDAudByaa	Ok, pongamos esto en claro<br>  <br>  Todas esas terminaciones son marcadores, y se agregan a los nombres como se?al de respeto o de cari?o (dependiendo de la terminación).<br>  <br>  "-san" es el marcador que indica que reconoces a la persona con quien estás hablando al menos como un igual, y la estás tratando con respeto. Siempre que te vas a dirigir a alguien que no conoces, te están presentando, o que no te llevas de piquete de ombligo con él, tienes que poner "-san" tras su nombre (o mejor dicho su apellido, porque si no es tu conocido, no puedes usar su nombre. Es de mala educación).  Por eso NUNCA debes usar el "-san" cuando estás hablando de ti. Si lo haces, los demás te considerarán un creido, ególatra y arrogante. Sería el equivalente a se?or, se?ora. se?orita, pero no siempre se puede traducir así. No usar "-san" tras el apellido de una persona que no es tu amiga, se considera muy descortés.<br>  <br>  "-chan" es un sufijo que se usa tras los nombres (ahora si nombre y no apellido) de ni?os como hasta los 10 a?os, y chicas que conoces bien, o que son inferiores a ti en dignidad. Solo se puede agregar el "-chan" al nombre de un ni?o (ojo, no de una ni?a) si es mucho más peque?o que tu en edad y está por debajo de ti en dignidad. Si ese no es el caso, entonces hay que usar, como mínimo, "-kun". Si eres mujer, generalmente se usa el "-chan" solo en ni?os y ni?as peque?os y con amigas, jamás con hombres, a no ser que no te importe que piensen que eres una grosera o estés molestando a alguien.<br>  <br>  "-kun" se agrega al apellido de los ni?os a partír de los 8 o 9 a?os, y generalmente lo usan los hombres al hablar entre ellos si tienen el mismo estrato social, o si su situación social está por encima de la del hombre con el que están hablando. Si eres mujer, entonces se usa con ni?os y jovenes con los que tienes un trato un poco menos formal, y se pude agregar al nombre en lugar de al apellido. (Ese es el caso de Sasuke y Sakura. ?Ya notaste que Sakura jamás le dice a Naruto "Naruto-kun"?).<br>  <br>  "-sama" y "-dono" son honoríficos que denotan mucho respeto, y los usan todas aquellas personas muy por debajo de la dignidad de la persona con quien estén hablando, o de quien estén hablando. En espa?ol, el equivalente más parecido serían el "Don" y "Do?a" que ya no se usan desde el siglo pasado.

If you want to grow out your hair cut it about every 6 to 8 weeks. about once a month if not. You are right in that you mush keep the splits down or your hair will break off and get shorter.<br>  You also need to use professional products to keep your hair in the best shape it can.<br>  Now as far as look or style it is hard with out seeing you. But I will give you a run down on the basics.<br>  If you have a round face you want hair long off shoulder. and if short high on top and pulled away from face.<br>  If you have a high forehead you want bangs.<br>  A long skinny face you want a bob cut.<br>  a heart shaped also looks good in a bob.<br>  Square face, to make it rounder you could have a sassy short look around ear level. <br>  I wish I could help you more, but I tried my best.<br>  Good luck!|`|b7d1a2b1e3d92300d36fee6e053a44aeaa	Please next time spell properly, it's kinda hard to understand some one the words you have written.<br>  <br>  As for your hair, don't cut it anymore until it grows back to how it was and then get a trim. You didn't say how long it is at the moment so it's hard to advise you as to how to cut it.

Pero es igual que hinata, ino o sakura, despues de esto han entrenado mucho y de ellas no se sabe todavía que puede pasar, porque son muy buenas. Aunque a sakura ya la hemos visto luchar contra sasori, y realmente es buena, no tiene porque envidiar a otro ninja. Y de hinata e ino todavia no sabemos cuando ha dado de si su entrenamiento, pero seguro que aparecen con tecnicas muy buenas, y ayuden en misiones (lo digo por ino) porque apenas valía para luchar, y ella misma lo reconoció en los ultimos capitulos de naruto (220) que no hizo nada para ayudar.<br>  Tenten parece muy buena ninja igual que temari y ahora en shippuuden abria que ver como pelean, igual que cuando tenten se enfrentó a un clon suyo, y ganó.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|eChs7iyCaa	Pues en en examen chunnin Temari, se vio muy superior a tenten y no creo que eso haya cambiado con los a?os, aunque a mi me cae mejor TenTen.|`|jW9Jtrs8aa	=|`|wkVcz8Raaa	para nada temari es mas fuerte|`|2d41877510e9c51ece62d682b550b013aa	jaja noooo es mil veces mas fuerte ten ten ya q temari a perdido la practica jeje no mentiras para ser sincera temari me cae mal y hay q admitir q las dos son iguales puede q temari sea un poquito mas fuerte pero ten ten puede esforzarse|`|F3Toia3raa	aunque ten ten es buena no le puede ganar ni en sue?os a tenari|`|Fs27XCVCaa	Yo digo que no<br>  Pienso  que Temari es mucho mas fuerte q Tenten<br>  aparte Temari es un jonin y tenten aun es chunin<br>  Aparte las tecnicas de Temari son tambien mas poderosas|`|L2fHms0Daa	Temari es mucho mejor!!!! =D|`|UTzERFbyaa	Pos....me inclino por temari......:D....tenten esta muy cria todavia....<br>  En shippuden me inclino por la "novia" de Shika.....(aunque de verdad no lo sean ....serian una buena pareja..) XD....o.O|`|ZvUxuCbTaa	.....UU  Pelean en el examen de chuunin y Temari le mete una paliza bien grande.<br>  Tenten es un personaje invisible. No tiene personalidad. No tiene apellido. Su tipo de lucha es una completa mier.da pues todos sabemos que las armas ninja pocas veces dan....<br>  A veces me pregunto: Qué pinta Tenten en la serie? <br>  Pues probablemente les faltase un miembro en el equipo de Gai y la metieron de relleno.<br>  A mí me parece bastante patética.<br>  <br>  En cambio Temari, aparte de ser mayor que ella y ser hija del Kazekage, es mucho más fuerte. Su abanico es una buena arma siempre que lo tenga a mano. Shikamaru ya se impresiona con ella pues puede atacar y defender a la vez [pocas técnicas lo hacen...] y fue una de los que salvaron el culo a Konoha contra los 4 del Sonido.|`|beb368dc714e4de34ac9088000cf8a27aa	a  mi me caen bien las dos, pero creo k temari es mas fuerte, no??<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?

Sino no hubieran puesto a pelear a chouji contra el tipo de la aldea del sonido ke lo derroto de un solo golpe.<br>  <br>  Bueno para ver la fuerza de Hinata en el shippuden es todo cuestion de esperar xD|`|Cx9bfLvfaa	naji no viste las eliminatorias de los examenes shunin|`|G43vkza6aa	En las semifinales del examen chunin los oponenetes no fueron elejidos por su fuerza, fueron elejidos a la suerte, un ejemplo de esto es como sasuke, shino y kankurou vencieron a sus oponenetes sin esforzarse casi (exepto sasuke q le costo un poco por culpa del sello maldito), aunque neji es mas fuerte q hinata ella no se rindio y le dio buena pelea pero la verdad es q neji siempre a sido mas fuerte q ella.|`|QoKFBbQbaa	Neji es mucho mas fuerte q hinata.

9IWWQBm6aa	Eso siempre va a suceder, aún hoy a pesar de la globalización y similares que a veces se consolidan como una simple utopía las sociedades siguen con una barrera que impide el libre conocimiento de otras culturas, y esto pasa con el manga y el anime, quienes verdaderamente lo conocemos (esto no significa saber todo de todo) sabemos que más que unos diujos animados o caricaturas es una cultura y que cada elmento presente tiene un trasfondo detrás, lo cual lo hace diferente de muchas otras cosas, en otras palabras, podía decirse que eso de la tolerancia no s da muy bien entre otros, eso puedes verlo claramente en la partida de anti-otakus que hay regados por ahí<br>  Pero de todas formas lo importante es que sabemos que el manganime es cultura y que por ello ense?a muchas cosas, si bien es cierto que contiene sexo, violencia y cosas de ni?os, esto no implica que siempre sea así, ya que por ello existen diversos género. El manga es otro género literario y artístico, así como lo es el anime<br>  Saludos!!!|`|1Ts2bIa7aa	la verdad q a mi nunca me paso pero vbueno q feo si a vos te paso|`|2ZDUIAi7aa	A mi me lo dicen todos los días y se burlan de mi eso si me molesta.....|`|9x1ZxMA5aa	Pues si antes me lo han dicho ?y qué? ni modo, yo soy un orgullosamente fan del anime no me importa lo que digan los trolls o Anti otakus de eso y si se trata de gente normal me da igual también, a quien no le gusta el anime es por que no lo a visto, lo convenso para que lo vea y al final le termina gustando como a mis padres y otros amigos de la escuela que lo cricaban y ahora lo ven XD.<br>  <br>  Saludos a todos mis amigos de CyA y viva el anime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...........|`|AEsdxZqOaa	Si aveces me ha pasado pero no le doy importancia por que prefiero 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000... de veces ser fan de anime que de otras cosas|`|C8WmR2ulaa	MUCHOS ANIMES PROMUEVEN LOS VALORES Y A LOS QUE TE DICEN QUE ES PARA NI?OS ENSE?ALES EL PRIMER CAPITULO DE ELFEN LIED, HABER SINO SE HACEN EN LOS CALZONES.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXUSgxraXY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXUSgxra...</a>|`|M1dT7om4aa	Si,me la han llegado a decir algunas veces,que es para ninios y que no vale la pena verlos y que es un desperdicio de tiempo.pero ami no me importa,yo lo seguire viendo.Saludos.|`|PLySSKqEaa	son unos tontos solo deberian poner atencion a los dialogos tan maduros que en ocaciones tienen unos anime como evangelion.|`|Phj8WrxLaa	Si... te tratan de infantil.. inmadura... y no sé qué más!!!<br>  <br>  Yo admiro la imaginación y la técnica que poseen los dibujantes para transportarnos por un momento dentro de esas fantásticas historias!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Los que no puedan o quieran disfrutarlas... ni modo, ellos se lo pierden... jijijiji!!!|`|VD5bTGsfaa	es cierto, creo que a todos nos ha pasado.|`|dLzW5yB5aa	ps yo creo q todas las personas tnesmos nuestra propia opinion pero eso no significa q ellos deban empezar a insultarnos creo q ellos se sentirian mal si nosotros les insultaramos lo q a ellos les gusta q aprendan a RESPETAR <br>  a mi m a pasado pero nunca les hago caso y + los veo q importa<br>  <br>  el respeto a lo ajeno es la paz <br>  <br>  PD no m acuerdo si el dicho es asi|`|fb1a0decf32db23bbe897099c49ec659aa	pues si pero esque la verdad no saben ni que es por eso te dicen que es para ni?os, porque no saben que hay animes para adolecentes, adultos, etc. y tambien con clasificacion pero si supieran mas no te dirian eso y esque es cierto lo que dices que te ence?an cosas valiosas, porque muchos animes interpretan la vida de las personas y mediate los ves te van ence?ando situaciones diferentes. <br>  saludos!! =)|`|prO4zzM0aa	Si a mi tambien me critican por eso, pero no les hago caso<br>  Yo tambien he eprendido muchas cosas del anime como el apreciar las cosa sencillas y otros valores, a de mas de aprender sobre la cultura japonesa que es muy interesante!

Ademas de todo eso tiene una estetica muy buena, k lo hace mas creible aun. <br>  Yo creo k hay k respetar los gustos.

xxG1ZjkFaa	Hola!!<br>  La razon por la cual la mayoria de los personajes de caricaturas tienen 3 o 4 dedos y no 5 es para que el trazado sea dinamico al momento de dibujar. Si tenes alguna nocion sobre dibujo, sabras que la parte mas difícil de dibujar son las manos. Por eso seria muy trabajoso hacer constantemente una mano completa a caricaturas que por su historia o cacacteristicas no requieren un dibujo perfecto en su mano. <br>  Ejemplos de este tipo de caricaturas son Bugs Bunny y sus Looney Tunnes, Mickey Mouse e incluso Los Simpsons. El propio Matt Groening explico una vez que si la mano de cada Simpson tendria 5 dedos, seria desproporcionada con respecto al cuerpo, seria mas trabajoso y demoraria mas el dibujo.<br>  <br>  Esta es la principal razon por la cual ciertas caricaturas tienen menos dedos, una comodidad al momento de dibujar. Pero en otros casos esto no se puede hacer porque simplemente no quedaria correcto… te lo imaginas a Goku haciendo un Kame Hame Ha solo con 4 dedos?? Jaja<br>  Espero haber aclarado tu duda!! <br>  <br>  Saludos!!|`|1cbaa04f3c6d2e4be5aeb6db4c2ac05caa	Creo que a todos los escritores les gusta hacerlo asi|`|NYrne1ISaa	Se los has contado?

un mimo?, pero igual no me importa, es lo maximo!<br>  <br>  bye =)|`|820490e03d2cb280b257209da36c0d44aa	pues hay varias sobretodo en el poder q usan cuando veguata vino a la tierra a luchar con goku tenia la fuerza de destruir la tierra como puede ser si su poder apenas alcanzaba lo 20mil de poder y cuando ya en supersaiyayin q se supone  tiene mucho mas poder lanza su ataques   superior a la cantidad de 20mil y no destruye la tierra|`|JEGFiLt7aa	Lo de trunks que vuelve al presente :S<br>  En eso me hago bolas... se me hace ilogico y como es que aparece en Gt.<br>  ?Como es que bulma tubo un hijo con vegeta?<br>  Jejeje xD<br>  <br>  Bueno.--- saludos|`|NLzcU0n8aa	1.- Cuando piccolo pelea con goku y lo derrota posterior mente piccolo toma el castillo del rey y el sirviente de piccolo le pide a los mejores chef del mundo hacerle los mejores platillos para satisfacer el hambre de su amo, no se supone que los namekianos solo toman agua. <br>  <br>  2.- Después de que goku lo derrota y nace piccolo de nuevo él esta en medio del océano (piccolo ni?o) flotando en el agua y destruye una embarcación con sus poderes, posteriormente saca con sus poderes un pez y se lo como, que raro, no? <br>  <br>  3.- Goku en la serie de dragón ball gt, pelea con uno de los dragones de las esferas y este le deja caer un edificio, para lo cual goku de ni?o no lo puede sostener ( pero de perdis goku ni?o flota en el aire, jejeje) teniendo que convertirse en un súper saiyajin 4 para poder lograrlo ( a duras penas lo consigue), siendo que en la pelea en dbz con freezer, este con sus poderes levanta una monta?a de tierra gigantesca del tama?o de una isla, lo arroja hacia goku y este lo detiene con facilidad, creo que sin la necesidad de usar el kayouken, pues todavía no podía transformarse siquiera en súper saiyajin. <br>  <br>  Dragon Ball Z. <br>  <br>  1.- ?Qué sucedió con el hermano de Dende? Recordemos que Dende y su peque?o hermano se encontraban juntos en una peque?a aldea de Namekusein cuando Freezer llegó a este planeta. Los hombres de Freezer mataron a este ni?o, salvándose Dende, pero, si luego resucitaron a todos los que murieron a causa de Freezer ?Por qué este peque?o Namekusein no volvió a la vida?, ya que todos los que fueron asesinados por Freezer y sus hombres si volvieron a la vida. <br>  <br>  2.- En el especial de Dragon Ball Gt donde aparecen Goku y Vegeta Jr, ?Por qué Goku Jr. trata de reunir las esferas del Dragón para su abuela (Pan) si cuando destruyeron a todos los dragones malignos, Shenlong dijo que no cumpliría más deseos y depues de esto desaparecierón las Esferas del Dragon. ?Por que Goku Jr encontró la Esfera de 4 estrellas?. <br>  <br>  Justificación: Este realmente no es un error debido a que Goku cuando se fue Sheng Long paso a ser algo asi como el guardian de las Esferas del Dragón y nuestro heroé fue quien le permitio a Goku Jr. volver a utilizarlas para curar a su abuela Pan. <br>  <br>  3.- En DBGT Goku y Vegeta se Fusionan por medio de la técnica del Planeta Metamour, el caso es que Esta técnica la usaron los dos en una película, no en la serie, así que no debieron ponerla... <br>  <br>  4.- En la serie podemos ver que a veces a Piccoro le sale sangre de color rojo y a veces sangre morada?a que se deberá esto? <br>  <br>  5.- En Dragon Ball Gt podemos apreciar que después de la muerte de Baby, específicamente en la batalla contra el Super Androide Número 17 sale Cooler del infierno. No se supone que Cooler solo aprecia en dos películas y no en la serie normal. <br>  <br>  6.- Trunks, Bra, Pan y Goten nacieron sin cola pero si Gohan tuvo cola su hermanito también la deberia tener, pues de Trunks y Bra claro que lo deberían tener si su padre es Vegeta, pero Pan tal vez no lo debe tener ya que es 1/4 Saiyajins. <br>  <br>  7.- ?Porque?- Si el Androide #16 siendo enteramente Androide al ser golpeado le sale sangre Roja, ya que sucedió esto cuando Cell le vuela la mitad de la cabeza y también cuando lo destruye totalmente.?Tal vez sea aceite de color rojo??no lo creen asi? <br>  <br>  8.- Cuando se destruye la Luna los saiyajins convertidos en monos gigantes vuelven a la normalidad. Pero cuando Tarles, un supuesto hermano de Goku que aparece en el largometraje "La Super Batalla", crea una falsa Luna para hacer que Gohan se transforme, después la destruye, pero Gohan sigue siendo un mono. ?Será porque era una Luna Falsa?. <br>  <br>  9.- Los Saiyajins nacen con un tipo de cabello determinado y ese no les crece nunca y además no les crece la barba y el bigote. ?Porque Napa era calvo y tenia bigote?, ?Como hubiera sido Raditz el hermano de Goku en tercer nivel si ya tenia el cabello bastante largo?.?Por que en Dball Gt Vegeta aparece efeitandose? <br>  <br>  10.- ?Que pasó? Es extra?o que Goku y Vegeta nunca pensaron reconstruir el Planeta Vegita con las esferas del dragon. Si Dragon Ball siempre explicaba las anomalias como por ejemplo: "Goku tiene cola porque es de una raza de otro planeta", "Krilin tenia los puntos en la frente porque en la academia de artes marciales en que iba cuando era aun más peque?o se los hicieron", "Puar y Oolong se transformaban porque iban en una escuela en que les ense?aban a hacerlo" Porque las siguientes anomalias nunca se explicaron: ?Porque Chaoz es blanco y no crece?, ?Porque Ten-shin-han tiene un ojo mas? <br>  <br>  11.- ?Por qué el Androide Super 17 tiene en su brazo de una ametralladora, si los guerreros Z no pueden ser afectados por las balas, ya que además nunca llegaran a tocarles? <br>  <br>  Justificación: Tal vez fue un complemento, recuerden que la patrulla roja utilizaba armas al principio. <br>  <br>  12.- ?Por qué en la pelea qué tuvo Vegeta contra las Fuerzas Especiales Gui-Niu, Vegeta fue derrotado fácilmente, aunque elevó su poder alrededor de los 30,000. Poco después de ser derrotados las fuerzas Gi-nyu por Goku, y matados por Vegeta, y mandadas estás al Planeta de Kaioh-Sama para entrenar a Tenshin-han y los demás en ese Planeta, ellos derrotaron fácilmente a las tropas Gi-Nyu, eso significa que deberían tener un poder alrededor de los 50,000, para ser derrotados tan fácilmente?, ?Cómo pudieron elevar su ki tanto, mucho más qué Goku si ellos no son Saiyayins? <br>  <br>  13.- ?Por qué en la película "Fusión ó "Revival Fusion", aparece presentándose ante Gohan y Videl el gran Freezer, aparentando ser el más fuerte, y ordenando a soldados que atacaran a Gohan, entre esos soldados estaba Boujack, que debería tener el nivel de pelea más alto que el de Freezer, ya que este sale en la Película Los Guerreros de Plata, y se enfrenta ante Gohan en Super Saiyajinn 2? <br>  <br>  14.- ?Por qué Trunks llega desde el Futuro con la espada a derrotar a Cyborg Freezer, siendo que esa espada la obtiene en la linea de tiempo a la cual él acaba de llegar, si el Trunks del Futuro nunca tiene contacto con Tapion (Conoce a Tapion en la película "El Pu?o del Dragón"). Y si lo ha llegado a tener ?Cómo lograron derrotar a Hildegan si fue Goku en SSJ-3 quien lo derrotó (Suponiendo que Goku estaba muerto)? <br>  <br>  15.- Si Gohan no conoció a Cell antes de que entre a la Habitación de Tiempo, ?Cómo es que sue?a Gohan que entra Cell y mata a Milk y a Piccolo? <br>  <br>  16.- En la pelea de la Saga de Cell, aparecen 7 Cell Juniors creado por Cell, pero cuando Gohan comienza a matarlos, en total mata explotando a 8 Cell Juniors .|`|Pv6Zd9E9aa	Guardar una casa entera en una capsula eso si estaba gruexo !!!!!!!!!|`|RTrGwjTVaa	se ay muxas <br>  jajaa<br>  a veces desaparecian los personajes <br>  jaja d exo no me kejo pues eran los ochentas|`|qUKwUbIUaa	algo igual es el radar q tenian los super saiyajin,  ya q solo apretando un boton se padia hacer todo, cmo leer la fuerza, ampliar la imagen, rastrear a otro indibiduo, medir la velocidad.<br>  q es eso, dond consigo toda esa tecnologia.|`|CRhTAdrTaa	DB es la mejor serie del mundo no tiene incoherencias es fantasia y DBZ es buenisimo tambien<br>  <br>  y despues esta DB GT|`|DHLCPwOUaa	que si mister satan no tiene poderes por que puede cambiarse de lugar como los que si tienen poderes.<br>  bueno esa es mi observacion.|`|Gohk1XrDaa	Jajajajaja, lo que pasa es que ese es un radar con padrinos magicos que con solo apretar ese boton y decear lo que quieren que haga el aparato ya esta.<br>  <br>  Pero bueno asi es la tv y mas si es un programa para ni?os, ponte a ver que hasta en las peliculas algunas veces cometen sus pelones.|`|UTzERFbyaa	Por que si vegueta tiene el pelo NEGRO y Bulma lo tiene como azul marino....el cabello de trunks(su hijo no se ni como) es lila???.....puro tinte...jja....<br>  o porque los sayayins al PRINCIOO necesitaban naves(capsulas) para moverce si volando le iba mejor??|`|btCn7TJ2aa	ja ja ja, nunca le havia dado importancia a ese detalle, es verdad|`|d0ZnM45Maa	la facilidad de reparar cosas en un santiamen y con apenas nada, y que además a veces para determinadas cosas el radar de dragon si que funciona, pero, bueno ahora no se me ocurre otra, pero alomejor están en una situacion diferente a la de siempre (no recuerdo cuando) y no funciona, el radar localiza las bolas de dragon cuando quiere|`|ffLhBriMaa	muchos sayayin se pueden convertir y sus cabellos cambian de color por fases 2 3 4 y 5 tanto en goku como vegeta<br>  <br>  gojan, y trunks sayayin fase 2  y 3<br>  <br>  goten sayayin fase 2<br>  <br>  no se si recuerden a Pan(hija de gojan) y Bra (hija de vegeta),  a ellas nunca las vieron en sayayin fase 2, bueno en una convencion de comics se subastaron las 2 tarjetas de ellas en 2 fase sayayin a un costo de 8000 pesos, algo que no quise pagar<br>  <br>  yo nunca las vi convertidas en la serie, pero en la convension si vi esas tarjetas carisimas y se veain muy bien, se veian mas adultas y por si preguntan la cabellera era amarilla oro.<br>  <br>  saludos<br>  .|`|r8rO7M9jaa	LOS PUNTITOS DE CRILIN EN LA CABEZA CUANDO ES CHIQUITO Y DESPUES QUIEN SABE QUE PASA Y YA NO LOS TIENE CUANDO CRECE...|`|rC9m2eFGaa	Aparte de todas ya las mencionadas,en Dragon Ball GT cuando Goku pelea contra el super cyborg 17# ?como puede ser que Goku en nivel 4 no logre matarlo con toda su fuerza  y en cambio el Goku peque?o lo atraviesa y mata como si nada?? <br>   La de la Habitación del Tiempo, en la saga de Cell te dicen que sólo pueden entrar dos personas a la vez, pero en la saga de Majin Boo entran hasta cuatro: Goten, Trunks, Piccoro y Boo.<br>  Misterios sin resolver....|`|uZIz9Z6Qaa	Se supone que al morir pierdes tu cuerpo, y solo hay excepciones con los guerreros que mueren por salvar a un planeta. ?Entonces como es posible que los villanos conservaran su cuerpo?<br>  ?

m0tzvsaaaa	Ok  this happened when I was 20. My friend, boyfriend and I went up to Canada to party and when we left at 2 am we had a long drive ahead of us. My boyfriend fell asleep drunk as a skunk in the back seat and my friend decided to pull over on this little empty road to sleep a little. I was in passenger side. Everyone fell asleep but me. All of a sudden I heard two cars pull on each side of us and some guy got out and walked in front of the car, he looked right at me and pointed. I woke up my friend and we heard gun shots. we were really freaked so we were frozen. The guy walked up to the car point the gun at me and then bashed it into the window on my side. The glass crumbled on me. Then he got into the car a drove off leaving the other car filled with bullet holes. My bf slept thru it all. It was so scary...

But beware: don't try it even it's the last thing you do: if she doesn't appear in the mirror and kill you, take your eyes off, take you to the mirror world, give you the opportunity to talk with a dead person (at midnight only) or even show you a part of your like like your future husband/wife (if a skull appears that means you will die before you get married), she will definitely try to kill you when you're sleeping or she will make your water, when you're having a shower, turn to blood.

Claro que si te pones a ver y a buscar mensajes , lo podes encontrar hasta en una publicidad de Bob Sponja, donde Calamardo es un terrorista y cangreburger es un negocio para lavar dinero.  No me gusta el anime, pero no estoy de acuerdo en que a cada cosa le quieran indilgar mensajes satanicos. No hay fundamento cientifico, la traduccion de nombras y palabras que hace no son reales. El significado de las palabras cambia dependiendo del contexto. Esto es lo que hacen cuando montan un reportaje a alguien y sacan de contexto las cosas.

Pero en el caso de dragon ball durante toooda la serie vienen capitulos haciendo referencia al sexo o a lo pervertido, como es el caso del Maestro Roshi, que simpre anda de calenturiento tocando las partes de chicas, como bulma y otras chicas de la saga y en el caso del unico mensaje satanico, que podemos apreciar a simple vista (y yo digo que cualquiera que ve dragon ball z en especial) es el opening de dragon ball z en la saga de Majin Bu, donde vemos cuando Gohan y Videl van en un auto de carreras en la carretera a orilla del mar, podemos ver que se ve el "666" en la puerta del lado donde conduce gohan y por que no, hasta el nombre de ox "Satan" padre de Videl y tambien otro peleador que es "Dabura" el rey de las tinieblas. Asi que no te sorprenda si Dragon Ball contiene mensajes subliminales. Quizas y hasta contiene más. pero para mi es un asunto que me tiene sin cuidado de los mensajes subliminales y quien no realmente se divirtio con esas escenas pervertidas de Roshi. jajaja,|`|R7F10mjEaa	jeje al principio si pero luego creo que fue pura publicidad|`|TTWjQTDPaa	hola!<br>  Han de ser puros inventos, no creo, no has oido lo de Pikachu?, eso es real.<br>  Aqui va:<br>  Pika quiere decir "Eléctrico".<br>  Chu: Ratón en japonés, aqui va, Pikachu al revés es Chukapi, quiere decir "1000 veces más poderoso que Dios.<br>  Saludos.<br>  <br>  ARRIVA EL ANIME, ROCK Y BOB ESPONJA!!!|`|VulIre7oaa	claro que no es de lo mejor del anime , ademas lo que decian de los nombres es verdad , por ejemplo toda la familia de goku  tiene nombre de comida como ;

fuera de ahí, lo que se dice en el video es una tremenda falacia.<br>  La narradora hace generalidades que hacen que pierda veracidad su "informe".<br>  En resumen, yo pienso que están más enfermos aquellos que ven en cualquier lado sinónimos de Diablo o Sexo.|`|sXsuBgjRaa	jeje si ya yo lo vi son muy comicos, ya no saben q inventar jeje<br>  <br>  si si los tiene, solo tienes q mirarlo vairas veces<br>  <br>  jajajajajajajajajajaaaaaajajaja|`|udXCotiDaa	no lo creo|`|CcufhO5waa	Bueno la verad es que yo no creo para nada en eso.. lo unico que tiene de sierto el video es que Dragon ball es la animacion mas famosa de todos los tiempos.. despues no le acerto ni si quiera en el lugar de origen!.. decia que era de China XDXD....<br>  jaja.... ademas creo que casi todos sabemos algunos significados de los nombres de tecnicas y personajes....|`|ObV7l6DHaa	la cuestio es que puede ser sierto pero estas afirmaciones son echas por grupos cristianos extremistas a los cuales los católicos llamamos envagelicos por que siguen al pie de la letra los cuatro envageleos y la palabra del pastor es la palabra de Dios y no se puede cuestionar <br>  <br>  estos grupos disen le lo único puro y que puede llegar a la groria de  Dios es por medio de ellos y les tienen proibido los demás visios por insignificantes que sean para que el único vicio que les quede sea asistir a los cultos religiosos dominados por los pastores <br>  <br>  dragón ball es un visio para la gente y lo consideran peligroso para el alma pero en realidad es peligroso para ellos porque al aver alguna distracción no se puede dominar bien a la gente <br>  ellos no solo consideran el anime como satánico sino las demás religiones como el budismo y demás mitologías como la griega por eso los caballeros del zodiaco son para ellos satanismo <br>  <br>  en conclusión puede ser que sea o no sea satánico el echo es que INVESTIGUE CON OTRAS FUENTES  vea que significa en realida estos nombres hay muchas fuentes <br>  <br>  ademas los dragones en japón y en china no son considerados el diablo sini signos de sabiduría y fuersa <br>  <br>  espero que esto le sirva <br>  <br>  gracias|`|PMaQiPZiaa	la verdad yo creo que si almenois e n algo creo que   goku signiofica poseeme algo por  ahi pero igual  la serie es muy  buena  no|`|S8x2hRWbaa	una farsa|`|UTzERFbyaa	Bueno....el tema de los " mensajes subliminales" en musicas o comicas....es un tema muy delicado....habran personas que digan que es un truco para alejar a la audiencia del programa o musica y habran otros que afirmen su contenido subliminal....este es un tema muy delicado y decir que el anime solo fue hecho para satisfacer a las personas es un pensamiento corto....de todo se ve en este mundo...y hoy en dia es facil encontrar a personas buenas como a no tan buenas...<br>  Bueno...este tema siempre se a considerado como una rama de la religion y todo lo concerniente a Dios..porque en la mayoria de los casos ellos son los que esponen dicha informacion o dibulgan que algo es subliminal...todos los casos que he visto han sido expuestos por creyentes nunca por "ateos"...ya sea que ellos no creen ni en el Diablo ni nada concerniente a "diabolico" asi mismo como en Dios....<br>  Como poner la confianza en algo o alguien que no cree ni sabe que creer?....<br>  Resulta ser que recientemente vi un MANGA bn popular llamado "666 Satan" en el cual un chico se mostrosiaba XD y le salia el 666 en la frente jajaja....

Tenian el estilo de animacion en anime, pero la narrativa y el dise?o artistico eran gringos (por eso en vez de pantalones, usaban calzones los felinos cosmicos XD).<br>  <br>  Ahora, esa porqueria que trata de ser anime es lo que me molesta, cosas como avatar, las caricaturas de adolescentes bien buenotas, que tienen laitas de hadas y cosas como los teen titans trantan de pasar por animes, pero en realidad solo copian los superficial. Llenan la serie de chistes simplones y te los meten forzadamente a cada rato, tratan de hacer cosas caracteristicas como la tecnica super deformed (cabezones, con unos cuerpecitos) o hasta en sus expresiones, pero hasta ahi, no entienden que eso no es la esencia del anime y peor aun, quieren hacerse pasar por ellas.<br>  <br>  Para darte un ejemplo, los de avatar les da miedo poner sangre, que en un verdadero anime harian que el protagonista sangrara cuando fuese herido.<br>  <br>  Meterian cosas mas gruesas como el maltrato, un poco de sexualidad, sufrimiento y demas cosas que en avatar nunca veras.|`|T1gKkbRWaa	Avatar es caso aparte... y una joya en los cartoons de estados unidos.<br>  <br>  Anime es sólo para lo japonés y aunue avatar sea genial, no es anim,e sólo por no estar heca en ni por japón.

Por su propio nombre y lo mostrado en el manga, parece indicar que permite a una alma cambiar de cuerpo, aunque los pormenores de técnica quedan sin revelar. Esta técnica, que se creía legendaria, era posesión del Maestro de los 6 caminos, el creador del ninjutsu moderno. La técnica reapareció en Nagato, un chico de la Aldea Oculta de la Lluvia que quedó huérfano en una guerra de ésta con Konoha. Jiraiya decidió encargarse de cuidar de Nagato y sus compa?eros Konan y Yahiko tras encontrase con ellos. Fue el responsable del entrenamiento de los mismos en las artes ninja más básicas, cosa que hizo tras descubrir que Nagato poseía esta técnica. Después de que Jiraiya decidiera terminar el entrenamiento cuando lo consideró oportuno, los tres jóvenes siguieron su propio camino. Gracias a su Rin'negan a?os más tarde Nagato posiblemente habita el cuerpo de Yahiko, y se hacía llamar Pein y para luego mas tarde para pelear con Jiraiya, se traslada a un cuerpo parecido al de Deidara.<br>  <br>  Con el Rin'negan el usuario puede dominar varios cuerpos, y los ojos de éstos son usados para ver de varios ángulos al oponente en un mismo instante, y detectar cualquier movimiento. Es así que los 6 cuerpos de Pein, en la pelea contra Jiraiya, pueden detectar y esquivar fácilmente los ataques del Sannin.<br>  <br>  Se dice que el poseedor del Rin'negan es un dios, que puede dar origen y fin al universo.|`|1y8Qb4Cyaa	estaria chido eso<br>  pero piensa esto<br>  ya ke kakashi<br>  no es un mienbro<br>  herditario del rinnegan<br>  para ke le traspasaran<br>  el ojo a pein le tendrian<br>  ke kitar un ojo en modo activado<br>  y asi se lo traspasarian a kakashi<br>  y entonces el no podria desactivarlo (lo mismo ke le pasa<br>  con el sharingan) <br>  entonces ke kieres ke ande con la banda tapando<br>  los 2 ojos? xD<br>  y ke ya no vea ni madres<br>  x ke no solo el byakugan gasta chacra<br>  todas las tecnicas sean hederitarias<br>  u oculares o mentales gastan chacra <br>  x eso no siempre andan con las tecnicas activas<br>  asi ke si kakashi<br>  andara con el ojo del rinnegan activado<br>  Dios le garia = de chakra ke el sharingan<br>  no se ketanta pero si le gastaria chacra<br>  <br>  <br>  asi ke ke propones ke viva su vida ciego<br>  con la banda en los 2 ojos?<br>  o ke siempre tenga uno destapado<br>  ya nde todo debil? xD<br>  la unica opcion de kakashi es nacer en cualkiera<br>  de esos clanes xke si no ni madres<br>  siempre tendria las 2 tecnicas activadas xD<br>  y tendria ke vivir como ciego xD o como debilucho<br>  asi ke ke opinas?<br>  <br>  dije mucho<br>  matta ne!|`|85h899GDaa	jaja no lo se¨<br>  <br>  <br>  ***saludos***!!!!|`|GN4Dlr8Naa	yo creo que no aguantaria ya que los dos absorbe chakra y el si o si tendra que estar con un ojo descubierto <br>  <br>  aunque el nombre es bueno...suerte|`|powPLPiKaa	?quien sabraa...?

cc1039bf52121f59cc16874161e53e07aa	bueno, la verdad es que para mi Megaupload es el mejor sitio de descargas ya que, aunque tengas la barra de megaupload (mejor conocida en los foros de descargas como Alexa Toolbar) a veces tienes que esperar hasta 6 horas para descargar entre archivo y archivo, dependiendo del navegador que tengas debes descargar la barra de Megaupload en caso de internet explorer y en caso de Firefox, tienes que hacer un cambio en el registro del mismo, el cual te explicaria aqui pero necesito copiar y pegar imagenes para ense?arte pero mejor te dejo el link, para que te reduzca los problemas de descargas, tal vez asi te puedas descargar 3 archivos y solo esperar 3 horas en lugar de 6.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://comunidad.wilkinsonpc.com.co/cgi-bin/foros/index.cgi?board=trucos;action=display;num=1147645953" rel="nofollow">http://comunidad.wilkinsonpc.com.co/cgi-...</a><br>  <br>  La otra opcion que te puedo dar, es que compres la membresia de 2 meses que vale 11.99 dolares, de la cual hay una manera un poco tardada pero segura de hacerlo que es hacer dinero viendo anuncios por internet y que te manden la plata a una cuenta de Paypal, aqui te explico como:<br>  <br>   * Crearse una cuenta paypal (www.paypal.com). Cuando lleguen al punto de poner una tarjeta bancaria, darle a cancelar porque no hace falta tenerla.<br>  <br>  Registrarse aquí <a href="http://bux.to/?r=byakuya1983." rel="nofollow">http://bux.to/?r=byakuya1983.</a> Vayan a JOIN NOW, llenen todos los datos, poniendo su mail real obviamente. Donde dice "paypal e-mail" deben poner la dirección de correo con la que se registraron en paypal.<br>  <br>  * Una vez registrados, la mecánica es sencilla, luego de apretar login y poner su nick y clave, van a “Surf Ads” y les va a aparecer una lista de direcciones. Abran una y esperen los 30 segundos de un contador que aparece arriba de la página. Luego otra y así con todas una a una y no todas a la vez, porque sino no las toma. Evidentemente para llegar al saldo para una cuenta premium tienen que hacerlo cada día, no toma más de 5 minutos. Para acelerar el proceso, pueden referir a otros usuarios como yo lo estoy haciendo.<br>  <br>  * Cuando lleguen a 10 dólares, el sitio les va a transferir automáticamente la plata a paypal.<br>  <br>  * Desde paypal pueden pagar la cuenta premium, o gastar la plata en lo que más les guste.<br>  <br>  Esto lo comparto para que despues nos podamos compartir via correo electronico uno que otro capitulo, esto no es broma, no les tomara mas de 5 mins ver los cinco anuncios diarios que te deja la pagina.<br>  <br>  aqui te dejo el link de la pagina<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bux.to/?r=byakuya1983" rel="nofollow">http://bux.to/?r=byakuya1983</a><br>  <br>  Como te dijeron arriba debes ser muy paciente para descargar desde megaupload, yo ya he bajado varias series y juegos de xbox y xbox 360, con muy buenos resultados, solo que al principio es desesperante pero al final te das cuenta que el esfuerzo valio la pena.<br>  <br>  Saludos y suerte.<br>  <br>  Its more than a Soul<br>  Its Soul Engineering|`|UTzERFbyaa	Hola....parece que estas un poco confundida...MEGAUPLOAD no es para ver...si no para bajar...es un almacendor en la red...del cual con la direccionn exacta te bajas el archivo que deseas....al principio si te sale que necesitas bajar una toolbar de megaupload no te bajes nada de eso..pues es promocional e incerbible....si quieres VER...mejor utiliza Veho o Youtube....que no necesitas bajar los videos.........pero si aun quieres bajarlos por DD(descarga directa) metodo que utiliza megaupload...y te dice que todos los puertos de tu pais estan ocupados...descargate este archivo que "burla" esa pag que te dice "no hay puertos disponibles"......(es para Internet normal(no firefox)<a href="http://www.gigasize.com/get.php/-1099658514/megaupload_crack.rar" rel="nofollow">http://www.gigasize.com/get.php/-1099658...</a> <br>  Si usas fire fox este link talvez te sirva..<a href="http://www.mxgamers.org/como-burlar-a-megaupload/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mxgamers.org/como-burlar-a-me...</a><br>  Despues si tienes problemas "has otra pregunta XD"----y te respondo.....wiii es que megaupload es una "digamos" no muy flexible opcion...XD<br>  Te lo dice alguien que descarga casi 5 archivos por dia en esa porqueria de megaupload....por eso busco opciones como gigasize...y otros almacenadores...|`|bf790e2104e0cc117c63a344576d4052aa	lo que han comentado es verdad, lo que pasa con megaupload (servicio más utilizado para poner episodios de anime en descarga directa) es que cuando abres el vinculo, generalmente te dice algo asi como "nuestro servicio gratuito no esta disponible", y generalmente solo puedes bajarte un capitulo al dia debido al tama?o del archivo, se paciente, para adelantar un poco las cosas registrate gratis en megaupload. asi en vez de esperar 45 segundos para que saque el enlace solo esperas 25 segundos (es un avance no?) y descarga la barra de megaupload, si no no se va a poder, otra opción (la que utilicé yo) fue contratar una cuenta premium, y ahora puedo descargar todo lo que quiera, para eso necesitas una cuenta de Paypal para que la transacción sea inmediata y te de acceso, es un poco caro, pero por ejemplo, en promedio pagué $1 peso mexicano al dia por el servicio (2 a?os por US$69.99) y me resultó perfecto.<br>  <br>  ahora si bien quieres solo ver las series, ya han dado anteriormente paginas donde ver animes, las cuales son:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.veoh.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.veoh.com</a><br>  <br>  recuerda que al buscar, siempre utilices todas las posibilidades de busqueda, por ejemplo si buscas chobits (que es un anime que a cada rato borran de youtube) tus opciones serían:<br>  <br>  "Chobits"<br>  "Chibits"<br>  "stibohc" (chobits al reves)<br>  <br>  y puedes hacer lo mismo con el anime que gustes.<br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|g3i55MSbaa	si es por q lo suben todo por megaupload intestaste bajar la barra megaupload yo la tengo puesta en mi pc y descargo tranqui vos fijate = hay problemas con megaupload estan tratando de subir todo a otras pags por q megaupload ta fallando mucho si podes evita descargar por ahi por q te vas a embolar mal bueno eso lo se por pura experiencia chau|`|5f12996895542f2fdd4d03019392eb7aaa	porque debes descargarlos a tu compu Nat.

xxG1ZjkFaa	Hola!! Bueno.. basta ver mi avatar para ver quien es el personaje que mas me gusta de Dragon Ball. jeje<br>  Me gusta Vegeta por muchas cosas.. Primero porque es lindoo (jeje). Ademas me gusta su caracter y su personalidad... el ser orgulloso lo hace un personaje re interesante. Es muy inteligente y generalmente sus dialogos o lineas son muy buenas en la serie!!<br>  Ademas es un personaje que tuvo una gradual evolucion en la serie. Comienza siendo un personaje puramente malvado y de a poco de va ablandando pero sin perder en ningun momento su orgullo.. que es lo que me gusta.<br>  Tiene momentos para recordar ya que son pocos.. como cuando se sacrifica por las personas que quiere... o cuando dice que Goku es el saiyan No 1. <br>  Sus lineas y dialogos son muy buenas. Es lindo escucharlo hablar o reflexionar porque ahí se nota que a pesar que no es tan fuerte como Goku.. siempre usa la cabeza.<br>  <br>  En conclusion creo que el orgulloso Principe de los Saiyanjin es  un gran personaje y por eso es mi favorito!!<br>   <br>  Despues de Vegeta me gusta Trunks... mas que nada cuando es chiquito porque es gracioso.. Pero cuando es Trunks del futuro.. es el mas lindo!!!<br>  <br>  Saludos!!|`|p9YsXGa3aa	mi personaje favorito es y siempre se gohan (ni?o y adulto)<br>  es taaan tiernoo!!|`|B2SPY284aa	Vegueta.

Goku y el resto siempre destacaron eso. Pero como el se dedicaba a otras cosas (por ejemplo la madre lo mandaba a estudiar), no entrenada al 100 % como el resto.|`|1nOf7Ejiaa	la hija de <br>  mister zatan <br>  antes me parecia mucho<br>  a ella <br>  *** jajajaja***<br>  <br>  besos <br>  <br>  <br>  lalokita???|`|m74BDlIYaa	Mi personaje favorito es un tipo con cara de oso k aparece en el capitulo 72....en el minuto 47:32...en la parte de arriba de la pantalla...atras de un arbol....<br>  <br>  <br>  ......naa...en realidad me agrada la tortuga del maestro Roshi<br>  <br>                                           ^ ^|`|mmwPxYSAaa	goku el amor xaval|`|9VkXwgbPaa	Me gusta mucho Vegeta por su orgullo pero me gusta Gohan por que en mi opinion podria llegar a ser el mas fuerte si se lo propone por que en la saga de los androides cuando expulsa todo su poder es incluso mas fuerte que Gohan y en la saga de Majin Boo cuando expulsan todo supoder es mas fuerte que Boo e incluso cuando van  la mitad del ritual para expulsar su poder Goku se sorprende por su poder, no se por que cuando esta en su maximo poder en la saga de Boo no se convierte en SSJ2, si lo hubiera hecho seguro termina enseguida con Boo, creo que con ese poder podria intentar ser SSJ3, aunque no me lo imagino de pelo largo como cuando era chiquito.|`|rC9m2eFGaa	mm Trunks,porque es guapisimo,es el hijo de Vegetta y eso aun le da mas atractivo y me cae muy bien,porque apesar de ser guapisimo y riquisimo no es para nada ningun engreido,es tan dulze,aunque siempre me gusto mas mirai trunks,pienso que tenia mas caracter y era mas fuerte,tambien su historia era muy triste y te sentias mas cercano a el,por su gran humanidad.<br>  <br>  Pan,porque no es la tipica ni?a mona,,gritona,medio loca,cabezota e inteligente, se que muchos la odian pero ami me encanta,se nota que es la hija de Gohan,aunque me hubiera gustado que se viera una relacion mas estrecha con Gohan,como la que tubo un dia el con Goku,mi sue?o de Dragon Ball fue que Pan y Trunks se juntaran,de ellos naceria la estirpe mas fuerte saiyan,y que cara pondria Vegeta,su hijo con la nieta de kakkarrotto? jjaa seria bueno verlo,ademas que son la tipica pareja de anime todo el dia se lo pasan peleando, mm Trunks con Maroon no por favor!! sera mas bonita que Pan si,pero es horrible como viste,y es una ni?a tonta y debil, no se parece en nada a su madre.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bra tambien me gusta,que pena que no le dieran mas protagonismo,aunque Bra es una ni?a mimada y consentida, es muy divertida la relacion que tiene con su padre Vegetta, y es la unica que se atreve hablarle claro a Vegetta,ademas es lindisima,se parece mucho a Bulma.|`|Dna3UiYPaa	Para mi es Piccolo, por que mola como lucha, es fuerte, y porque es un buen luchador.|`|rxhpIqIAaa	*vegeta: porq q es muy lindo, orgulloso, sexy y etc...<br>  *trunx: por q esta muy uqerido y por ser hijo de vegeta, pero se ve mejor en el gt jeje,<br>  *gohan: pero como guerrero no de gafitas ...|`|F8AOHQEjaa	A mi me gusta mucho tronks cuando grande, pero más cuando chiquito por las épocas de mayinbu...

Es decir, Son Goku y Vegeta. Aunque sinceramente prefiero la primera temporada de la serie cuando Goku era peque?ito. Había más dosis de humor y no por ello dejaba de haber acción.

Ligeramente basada en la primera novela de Ian Fleming sobre el agente 007, la cual había sido publicada en 1953.<br>  <br>  Sir James Bond (David Niven), vive su retiro en su mansión escocesa, pero es interrumpido por los jefes de los servicios secretos más importantes (John Huston, Charles Boyer, William Holden y Kurt Kaznar), quienes le piden que acepte una misión. Sir James no acepta, pero cuando dinamitan su mansión, no le queda otra alternativa que hacerlo.<br>  <br>  Para confundir al enemigo, Sir James recluta agentes y a todos ellos los llama James Bond 007, incluyendo a las chicas. Pero Sir James más tarde se entera que el responsable de todo es su sobrino, Jimmy Bond (Woody Allen), que planea eliminar a todos los hombres más altos que él y hacerse a todas las mujeres hermosas.<br>  <br>  Actores, personajes y creditos  <br>  <br>  Sir James Bond - David Niven <br>  Evelyn Tremble/James Bond - Peter Sellers <br>  Dr. Noah/Jimmy Bond - Woody Allen <br>  Mata Bond - Joanna Pettet <br>  McTarry/M - John Huston <br>  Vesper Lynd - Ursula Andress <br>  Le Chiffre - Orson Welles <br>  The Detainer - Daliah Lavi <br>  Agent Mimi/Lady Fiona McTarry - Deborah Kerr <br>  Ransome - William Holden <br>  Le Grand - Charles Boyer <br>  Himself - George Raft <br>  French Legionnaire - Jean-Paul Belmondo <br>  Cooper/James Bond - Terence Cooper <br>  Miss Moneypenny - Barbara Bouchet <br>  Miss Goodthighs - Jacqueline Bisset <br>  Hadley - Derek Nimmo <br>  Polo - Ronnie Corbett <br>  Inspector Mathis - Duncan Macrae <br>  Frau Hoffner - Anna Quayle <br>  Smernov - Kurt Kasznar <br>  Buttercup - Angela Scoular <br>  Eliza - Gabriella Licudi <br>  Heather - Tracey Crisp <br>  Peg - Elaine Taylor <br>  Meg - Alexandra Bastedo <br>  Director del Casino - Colin Gordon <br>  Carlton Towers - Bernard Cribbins <br>  Fang Leader - Tracy Reed <br>  Casino / Hombre del M.I.5 - John Bluthal <br>  Q - Geoffrey Bayldon <br>  Fordyce - John Wells <br>  Cajero del Casino - Graham Stark <br>  Chic - Chic Murray <br>  John - Jonathan Routh <br>  Oficial de British Army - Richard Wattis <br>  Representante de Le Chiffre - Vladek Sheybal <br>  Conductor - Stirling Moss <br>  Piper - Peter O'Toole <br>  1st Piper - Percy Herbert <br>  Chica del control - Penny Riley <br>  Capitan de Guardias - Jeanne Roland <br>  Mayordomo de Sir James Bond - Erik Chitty <br>  Dr. Noah's voice - Valentine Dyall <br>  Chinese General - Burt Kwouk <br>  Asistente de Vesper Lynd - Paul Ferris <br>  Chofer - John Le Mesurier <br>  Monstruo de Frankenstein - Dave Prowse|`|Tf6kBWZNaa	Aca te dejo un link con la pelicula que buscas, Saludos T R<br>  <a href="http://www.sssm.com.ar/casino-royale-1967.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sssm.com.ar/casino-royale-196...</a>|`|pdGUpl9kaa	es casino royale con el actor daniel craig

I am almost 17 and i want to direct horror movies. I have been filming various things for a few years, but you definately need to go to a type of film education. I would also suggest watching a lot of movies that you like and then you can see what things you need to know.|`|19eb83a3ed05abe83db05aafd4055395aa	No, you do not need to go to school first. If you have these qualities of a great director, then you'll be successful witout school................<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Authoritative: A great filmmaker must have a strong sense of authority. They are responsible for leading a team to create an outstanding finished product and must command the team to ensure they are working at their best. <br>  2. Communication: A great filmmaker must have excellent communication skills. They must be able to clearly articulate what their production goals are and be able to work with all team members to accomplish that goal. <br>  3. Creativity: A great filmmaker must be very creative. They must be able to generate ideas for stories, backgrounds, music, and other elements that are involved in a film production. <br>  4. Decisive: A greatfilm maker must be able to make firm decisions and stick to them to help ensure production stays on track. <br>  5. Drive: A great filmmaker has a tremendous sense of drive and ambition. They are willing to do whatever it takes to rise to the top of the industry and make great films. <br>  6. Grace Under Pressure: A great filmmaker is able to handle pressure well. They understand that complications will arise during the film making process and are able to handle the stress. <br>  7. Open Minded: A great filmmaker is open minded to changes in his or her ideas. They accept input readily and consider other points of view without judgment. <br>  8. Problem Solving: A great filmmaker can quickly address problems that arise during production. They are able to identify problems and figure out the best way to fix them. <br>  9. Technologically-Savvy: A greatfilm maker is familiar with many, if not all, of the technological elements that are involved in the film making process. They have a grasp on what is feasible and what is not. <br>  10. Vision: A great filmmaker has a terrific vision and can see the film from its conception through to its final product. They never lose sight of the ultimate goal.|`|dca208cdd9182f335b618e61db92ef70aa	Start watching movies by good directors and looking for a good film school to attend after you graduate. Watch Scorcese, Coppola, Spielberg, Billy Wilder, Frank Capra, John Huston, John Ford, Howard Hawks, Ridley Scott. Don't ignore the classics, much can be learned from the history of film. Again, find a good film school.<br>  <br>  When I was 17, I wanted to be a director too. I studied Radio, TV and Film... I wish I'd gotten a business degree. A film degree is expensive and you will have a long struggle.

Rk0FhjfEaa	Her name was Aaliyah.<br>  <br>  <br>  On August 25, 2001 at 6:45 pm, the lives of 8 people that we know and loved were taken in a plane crash leaving Marsh Harbor, Abaco Island in the Bahamas. The plane was en route to Miami and they would have taken approximately 1 hour travel time. Instead, as the plane was lifting off the runway with nose down it impacted in a marsh on the south side of the departure end runway 27...the plane went down. Total gross weight of the airplane (Cessna 402B) was exceeded. As a result, the preliminary center of gravity was significantly outside the flight envelope past the aft center of gravity. Contrary to reports, not one passenger insisted on anything. They merely got out of air conditioned cars and embarked on the plane. They did not know of any danger (how could they?) that might ensue. We thank the law firm of Kreindler & Kreindler for the work they did to find the truth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  We feel our fans friends and others needed to know this. We do not want anyone to be hurt anymore. Even though the pain, grief and loneliness of all lost will never go away - we have been advised through counseling and through the love and all who have supported as that we must try to move on.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  With Sincerest gratitude we honor and welcome you to the Aaliyah website. We hope that through this site you will get to see and read what Aaliyah's life and life in general is about. Happy times, sad times, times when we all may want to give up, can be handled through faith and courage; the same faith and courage that they (on the plane) all had. Will we ever understand why? We think not but we know what "Baby Girl" (the name her dad gave her when he saw this specimen of beauty) would want. She would want us to strive for the best, to realize she fulfilled a lot of her dreams with us by her side; encouraging and fostering what she learned and experienced so young. She would want the brother she adored to not give up and to continue the dreams that they had together. Aaliyah was/is definitely special. She found the good in everyone. She also knew her career in the world of entertainment had it's ups and downs. We learned all of that the hard way. The pain we endured as a family who never set out to hurt anyone with malice or forthrightness was quickly set back. We loved one another unconditionally - that was just the way it was. We never thought about it, we just did no matter what. We will never forget what happened on August 25th, 2001, we can only work through the daily pain and ask "The Higher Source" to help us.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Lastly, any and all donations made online (or thru checks sent to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund) will be accounted for and handled with integrity. By giving to the charities that Aaliyah was just starting to work on, gives her life again. If you want to send donations to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund, you can donate either online or by check/money order. The address to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund is 331 West 57th Street, #281 New York, NY 10019. Please make checks out to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund. You can also go to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund section on the site for more information about the fund and the causes it supports. (please click here)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Remember "Baby Girl" is with us, all of her friends are with us. Forever - until again...and although this was the first video that we were not all together on due to (eye surgery (Diane), stroke (Michael) Australia (Rashad) we know Aaliyah, Keeth (who went as our friend to watch Aaliyah), Christopher, Eric, Anthony, Scott, Gina, Doug are all watching over us and saying we are alright, don't worry, don't cry for we are at peace!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  We say we will see you again in a better place where there is no hatred and despair. Yes we will see you and tell you how much you were and are still loved!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  With Aaliyah and Her Comrades In Our Hearts!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Haughton Family!<br>  <br>  Pray for us all!<br>  Respectfully<br>  Sincerely<br>  With the light of the Highest, Most Exalted, The Best... Aaliyah<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. we also would like to acknowledge the pilot Luis Morales whose life was also taken as a part of this tragedy. Our hearts go out to his family and friends.|`|AG9J1jm7aa	I think it was aliyah[ not sure if that's how you spell it]|`|ZAIBVaKCaa	Her name is Aaliyah. It was a really bad way of dying in my opinion.|`|lWAe75nraa	yeah aliyah|`|vf7SpJEHaa	Aaliyah|`|c5f3abb42b654f04239d09e8e781bf2baa	It sounds like you were talking about Alliyah and she died in a plane crash in the Bahamas.|`|fe1ccfe08a523bc21257ca4e6b7edff1aa	Aaliayah the singer, plane crash in the bahamas.|`|4U8XpEXWaa	Aaliyah. It's a shame that she died too because if she hadn't she would have been a big star right now. She had a great voice and she was a good dancer and at the time that she died she was starting to get a lot of roles for movies. I have noticed that since her death there have been a few copycats such as Beyonce, and especially Ciara. She was better than both of them combined if you ask me.|`|AA12246571	This information was on Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  On August 25, 2001, at 6:49 pm (EST), just after wrapping up filming of the "Rock the Boat" video, Aaliyah and various members of her record company boarded a twin engine Cessna 402B (N8097W) at Marsh Harbour, Abaco Island, Bahamas to travel to Opa-locka Airport near Miami, Florida, but the plane crashed shortly after takeoff about 200 feet from the runway. Pilot Luis Morales III and all eight passengers, including Aaliyah, were killed in the aviation incident. According to findings from an inquest conducted by the coroner's office in the Bahamas, Aaliyah suffered from "severe burns and a blow to the head," in addition to severe shock. The coroner theorized that, even if Aaliyah had survived the crash, her recovery would have been virtually impossible given the severity of her injuries.<br>  <br>  Aaliyah's eulogy was held on August 31 at Saint Ignatius Loyola Roman Catholic Church on East 84th Street in Manhattan, NYC.|`|XKNQkwuGaa	you might be talking about alia, she was in a vampire movie when she died|`|vDTwKm6Iaa	Yes, her name was Aaliyah and she was an actress and a singer.  I really liked her in "Romeo Must Die" with Jet Li and "Queen of the Damned". <br>  <br>  Such a tragedy for a very beautiful talented young woman!

qZIMSeKzaa	It was unnecessary to the movie as a whole. It did add dimension to the movie, a more ...human element to it. The one thing it wasn't was hokey. I am a fan of action and special effects, but the way the Autobots bonded with humans, would have been highly disjointed without  a love interest sub-plot. That part of the movie showed Optimus Prime the level of caring that humans are capable of. A boy and his first car bond would have been hokier as a stand alone story line.|`|Mlwd5Bt3aa	It wasn't necessary, but it didn't add or take away from the movie.

Its about what happens in the 3 weeks of their "course"..for the most part. Some of the tests that the have to pass are incredibly ......out there. its also a sweet love story at the same time. But if you love to laugh then go see it!!!
hiJXETeRaa	This has been debated for a while.  Mystic form is so powerful, Gohan was said to not need to go Super Saiyan to access his full power.  However, it was never said he couldn't, just that it was pointless to transform because he didn't need to.  Later, in DBGT, he goes Super Saiyan.  Some say his lack of training made him unable to attain Mystic form any longer.  Others say he could now access more power by going Super Saiyan.  If the latter is the case, then plenty of people could surpass him as was shown in the series.  However, I subscribe to the former theory, since Goten could hold his own against Gohan in his Super Saiyan form, & he never attained Super Saiyan 2 in DBZ.|`|8zsYmz53aa	No, but only because his entire potential is already unlocked, he can't get any stronger without training.|`|gL7IBFvmaa	probably yes and most likely no....unless u count chuck norris

The text of the latest book is available for download on Usenet and some peer to peer networks, but there are several books being passed around as the real one although they are not. Downloading the actual book from one of these sources is not considered legal. However there are some excellent fan fiction books which have been passed off as JK Rowling. I recommend reading "The Seventh Horcrux" by Melindaleo. It is freely available on the web at her homepage.<br>  <br>  I understand why it is better to have the digital copy. Unfortunately, the author does not feel the same way. The author has never published them as eBooks, so they just aren't out there for legal usage. I purchased the hardback book from Borders bookstore today, it's only 20$. Once I had the real book I was able to tell which is the real one on Usenet. I downloaded that so I can read it on my e-ink Sony Reader.<br>  <br>  To: "Cool Gurl" -- Your spelling and grammer are atrocious.

"After touring extensively for 2 years following the release of American Idiot, the band decided to use 2006 to take a break, and begin the writing process for new material. In an interview with NME Magazine in December 2006 (read the article) Billie Joe mentions that the band has at least three albums worth of new material they are working with. They are still unsure the direction the new album will go, as far as style, but they are using this time to write together and come up with ideas."

hqDAudByaa	De hecho no se llaman igual.<br>  "Fullmetal Alchemist" es una mala traducción del japonés al inglés del nombre de la serie. En japonés se llama "Hagane no Renkinjutsushi" o "鋼の錬金術師" que significa "Alquimista de Acero". De hecho, en el manga jamás se menciona el nombre "Fullmetal Alchemist", excepto en la traducción al inglés. Ed es "el Alquimista de Acero" y punto.<br>  <br>  "Full Metal Panic!" (nótese que aquí "full" y "metal" son palabras separadas) sí se llama así desde el principio. El nombre en japonés es "フルメタル パニック！", está escrito en katakana, es decir que tanto en japonés como en inglés se llama "Full Metal Panic!".<br>  <br>  Asi que supongo que todo fue una coincidencia generada por una pésima traducción en los Estados Unidos.|`|b075fb0d50b225eca178fe56ce72693eaa	Mera coincidencia de epocas y nombres, ambas significan algo asi como absoluto y al mismo tiempo que algo esta hecho a prueba de todo, por lo tanto la traduccion seria:<br>  <br>  El alquimista a prueba de todo.<br>  Panico a prueba de todo.<br>  <br>  Suerte.|`|CGxEHdtWaa	uhhhhhhhhhhhhh si es cierto<br>  psst solo se parecen en eso Full Metal<br>  por los animes son completamente diferentes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|77d36a8d2cb4cfc83ac275cac1ca7aa2aa	es solo la forma de traducirlo como dice el chico de arriba|`|7e45bc08df89c054ae7c738565ac47bfaa	A lo mejor son del mismo creador y quiere que todas sus series tengan nombres similares pero no tengan el mismo tema en la serie.|`|qUKwUbIUaa	por q fullmetal es algo asi como acero <br>  fullmetal panic= panico de acero <br>  fullmetal alchemist= lquimista de acero<br>  es coincidencia de nombres.|`|sXsuBgjRaa	mira la cosa esta asi, hay animes que son de los mismo creadores o de los mismo dise?adores, entonces le ponen<br>  <br>  o nombres parecidos o historias parecidas<br>  <br>  tal es el caso de samurai x y samurai champloo, en este caso las historias son parecidas y el nombre tambien<br>  <br>  espero haberte ayudado|`|C8WmR2ulaa	FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST: ALQUIMISTA DE ACERO<br>  FULLMETAL PANIC: PANICO DE ACERO<br>  <br>  EN REALIDAD ES UNA MERA COINCIDENCIA EL PARECIDO DE LOS NOMBRES Y NO TIENEN NINGUNA RELACION.<br>  <br>  PERO EN ALGO SE PARECEN; EN QUE LOS DOS SON GENIALES!!!!!!|`|UTzERFbyaa	Bueno..."x-1999"...."adam2"....dijo algo que es cierto...y en muchas series de anime sucede esto...<br>  Hagane no Renkinjutsushi(Fullmetal alchemist en ingles)...<br>  フルメタル パニック！(Full Metal Panic)<br>  <br>  toma en cuenta que al traducir titulos al ingles ...pues por concidencia se parecen....<br>  puesto que como ves en japones los dos titulos de las dos series son distintas...<br>  los de la idea del mismo autor no estan equivocados puesto que esto aveces sucede pero en este caso NO... tanpoco estan en lo correcto porque los productores no son nada iguales ...con estas dos series el director de Alchemist es Seiji Mizushima..director de animacion Takashi Mukouda y el de panic es Koichi Chigira ( un monton de animation staff)....para los detallistas Fullmetal alchemist se escribe pegado y Full Metal Panic se escribe separado por lo cual tanbn se le conoce como FMP!<br>  Mera y Mala traduccion solamente..<br>  <br>  Posdata...he repondido y me he dado cuenta que arriva alguien se tomo la delicadeza de explicartelo....eso ta bn......<br>  conste que no me copie onee-chan---XD|`|c584d064b3e5651b566fbc4050f8d4bfaa	solo es mera coincidencia xq ya ves q los animes no tienen nada en comun

La razon por la cual los Simpsons tienen 4 dedos es unicamente por comodidad al dibujar. Si sabes algo de dibujo.. sabras que la parte mas dificil de dibujar son las manos. Esto le suele pasar a los dibujantes de la mayoria de las caricaturas. Dibujar personajes con 5 dedos seria mas trabajoso. Si te pones a pensar hay muchos dibujos que tienen 4 dedos (o incluso menos).. por ejemplo.: Bugs Bunny.. Mickey Mouse, Silvestre..etc.<br>  <br>  Pero siguiendo con los Simpsons.. el propio Matt Groening dijo que dibujo sus personajes con 4 dedos para su comodidad. De esta manera evade dibujar la compleja mano humana y hasta puede dibujarla de un solo trazo. <br>  " ...Aumentar un dedo más supondría cambiar la configuración total de la mano y tendrían que hacerles la forma del exterior final de la mano o sino, la mano quedaría amorfa con cinco dedos gorditos en un mu?ón informe..."<br>  <br>  Espero que hayas disipado tu duda..!!<br>  <br>  Saludos!!|`|zV8HIMcWaa	No solo son los Simpson... si te das cuenta, en animacion cartoon se utiliza mucho ese "truquito" para "descomplicar" la gestualidad de los personajes y simplificarla de alguna manera... fijate en otros personajes y veras que es asi.<br>  MUY OBSERVADOR!!!!.<br>  Abrazo!.|`|8XRSiTHDaa	Porque son iguales de extra?os al que los creó, o qué me dices de futurama? Todas las cosas se parecen a su due?o.|`|C8WmR2ulaa	TAL VEZ POR QUE SIMPLEMENTE SE LES DIO LA GANA HACERLOS ASí|`|EddJ9zX2aa	bueno en general los simpson y entre otras caricaturas vienen con 4 dedos por que asi la gente dice que las caricaturas son con imaginacion|`|R7F10mjEaa	porque en casi todas las caricaturas hacen eso o para que no se vea exagerado|`|sXsuBgjRaa	asi son la mayoria de los dibujos americanos, tienen solo 4 dedos en la mano, xq le hacen los dedos muy grandes y la mano muy peque?ao muy redonda|`|tvZIMd71aa	Ya lo había respondido antes, según un documental que ví es para ahorrar tinta....|`|z1Ehx142aa	Pues no solo en los simpsons, hay muchas caricaturas que solo tienen 4 dedos ,? sera porque nada mas son caricaturas? .. o talvez quiera ahorrarse el trabajo o se les haga muy trabajoso hacer 5 dedos en los dibujos|`|zERSAt32aa	En un episodio Homer explica que le horrorizaria tener la piel de color carne y 5 dedos en una mano, y a continuación sale una imagen de bart, lisa y maggie tal y como serían si fueran humanos.|`|4xAChPTAaa	tienen solo 4 dedos?? ni cuenta yo jeje hoy me fijo|`|65yGpmBPaa	porque se supone que ellos no son humanos como nosotros..... la idea era hacerlos diferentes para que se notara|`|8hE8q7Cyaa	Porque a los yankees se le olvidó y porque si no usan más memoria y lentitud en hacerselo|`|Pt3GSdaNaa	Te recomiendo:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lossimpsonsonline.com.ar/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lossimpsonsonline.com.ar/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Esta muy buena y es muy completa.<br>  Salu2|`|STVpurwWaa	Para que veamos que son diferentes y aparte es mas fácil dibujar 4 dedos que 5, si no prueba tu haber como te salen mejor.xD|`|UTzERFbyaa	Eso seria como preguntarme...Por que homero dice oug....o porque ellos son amarillos o xq Lisa tiene el pelo amararillo como su cara ooo....porque March tiene el pelo azul....jja simplemente porque son caricaturas....es mas bien dado al estilo y creatividad...del dibujante...."hey arnold".."rugrats crecidos"..tanbien tienen 4 dedos...es mas bien toque del dibujante....<br>  Ta taii|`|lzU6iPOQaa	EN REALIDAD LOS SIMPSONS LLEVAN 4 DEDOS PORQUE HACER 5 ES UN GRAN LIO<br>  TE LO DIGO PORQUE YO DIBUJO<br>  Y ME CONTARON COSAS ASI<br>  PERO CON MIKEY|`|p9u3JkyFaa	pues la unica respuesta correcta a tu pregunta es porke es una caricatura.|`|y3a4WyY2aa	Porque es dificil hacerlos con 5, y de ese estilo se verian mal y abultados ademas porque les da un aspecto mas caricaturesco. <br>  Recuerdo un capitulo en el que Lisa estaba leyendo una revista donde decia que en unos a?os los humanos tendrian 5 dedos, fue muy gracioso.

There has never been any talk of a second season, and big chances are there will never be. If we're very lucky, maybe someday OAV's will be created.<br>  Just like Fruits Basket and many other shoujos, the anime ends way before the manga ever does. <br>  There have been a few radio dramas of Gakuen Alice made, and you can expect a few more to come in the future. Radio dramas acted by the anime voice actors are very popular with manga readers.

The former members of Clamp included Tamayo Akiyama, Soushi Hishika, O-Kyon, Kazue Nakamori, Yuzuru Inoue, Sei Nanao, Shinya Ohmi and Leeza Sei. By 1990, the circle had diminished from twelve to seven.

The August 2004 issue of Newtype USA, a magazine specializing in events of the anime and manga subcultures, reported that the members of Clamp simply wanted to try out new names. A later interview with Ohkawa revealed that initially Mokona wanted to drop her surname because it sounded too immature for her liking, while Nekoi disliked people commenting that her name was the same as Mick Jagger's. Ohkawa and Igarashi, wanting to go with the flow of Nekoi and Mokona's name changes, changed their names as well.|`|XoqIhYHDaa	Ageha Ohkawa, Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, Satsuki Igarashi<br>  <br>  <br>  =P They have some pretty good manga, don't they?!|`|5VO4g54Aaa	cardcaptor sakura: <br>  Fujitaka Kinomoto,Kero-chan , Keroberos, Meiling Li,Mizuki Kaho, Sakura Kinomoto,Shaoran Li , Tomoyo Daidouji, Touya Kinomoto, Yukito Tsukishiro, <br>  <br>  chobits:<br>  Chii , Chitose Hibiya, Dita, Hideki Motosuwa, Hiromu Shimbo, Kojima Yasuyuki, Kotoko , Minoru Kokubunji, Sumomo , Takako Shimizu , Ueda Hiroyasu, Yumi Omura, Yuzuki , Zima<br>  <br>  oooff....!!<br>  i can't write it all...<br>  if you want go to this site:<br>  <br>  www.animenfo.com<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!|`|SlpHUglVaa	Satsuki Igarashi, Ageha Ohkawa, Tsubaki Nekoi and Mokona<br>  <br>  hope it helps
mgEyhmu7aa	He solicited gay sex in an airport bathroom. But the person he was soliciting sex with was an undercover cop.<br>  Apparently, if you are in a public bathroom and want to have sex with someone in the next stall, you tap your foot a bunch and slide your hand along the bottom of the stall divider. Then the person comes into your stall or you go in theirs and have sex. and that's what he was trying to get some undercover cop to do.|`|c7b55e12652f4ec81f89aa3a6ff9c9eaaa	he was arrested and charged for being in a bathroom which is a known place for men to solicit for sex.|`|e61d9614bc5b03f216f18c28ecde0afbaa	According to the press, Senator Craig, a conservative politician, has been suspected of being gay for quite awhile. He entered a bathroom at the airport and according to a plainclothes police officer, solicited sex from him. The policeman showed his badge and arrested Senator Craig. Senator Craig lied to the police officer and claimed the signals he gave the police officer were not to have gay sex, but were because he was picking up papers off the floor. The officer said that he was upset that Senator Craig would chose to lie like that. Conservative Republicans are calling for his resignation. Others are saying that he did a good job and they are not yet asking for his resignation. Senator Craig pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and said he did that so he could move on, but that he wasn't guilty of anything. <br>  <br>  I think it is hard to be a Republican and be gay as the Republicans want to hold onto their conservative constituency. Senator Craig probably should have been more careful. Now that he has probably lied and committed a crime, they are going to want him out on that also. A lot of gay politicians marry because that is the only way they will get elected. So, he had to do it for his party and his constituency which may have been what led him to solicit sex rather than   end up in a monogamous relationship with a man. Given his age, he probably could not have been true to himself in any career he would have entered years ago. <br>  <br>  More than a decade ago, I dated a politician and both his ex-wife and I thought he was gay. He seemed to be attached to us but not physically.

xi0m2lndaa	Some tuners can do it, but if u haven't got one, then just use a capo. Put it on the first fret and tune it to as you would normally (EADGBE) Then take the capo off, and it will be down a half step. If u don't have a capo, then just use your finger. Put your finger on the first fret of the E string and tune it to E. Take your finger off, and you'll have Eb. Do the dame with the rest of the strings,and your guitar will be tuned down a half step!|`|b20ac29186832725b368480eb0588b1eaa	All you have to do is tune the strings individually down a half step.

y5RZPNhIaa	Naruto will become Hokage. Well actually I wrote out a whole scenario of how think Naruto will end although it would take me too long to type,but to keep it simple. I think that Naruto will either kill Sasuke or bring him back to the village. The Akatsuki will fall/all die. Sasuke will either figth Naruto and die,or he will come bck to the village,after killing his brother. There will be one finale battle between Naruto and Madara,then Naruto wins and he will become Hokage with Hinata at his side,and they will get married.<br>  <br>  Naruto Rocks!!!!!|`|HmPpgzeqaa	Naruto becomes friends with Sasuke again. <br>  Itachi and Lady Tsunade die.<br>  Naruto finally seals the kyuubi for good.<br>  Naruto and Hinata get together.<br>  Naruto becomes the Hokage.<br>  <br>  I dont know but thats what i think :)|`|tUwiwl4qaa	Naruto becomes the Hokage and him and Sasuke meet in The Valley of the End AKA The Final Valley and will have the ultimate battle and destroy everything around and Naruto wins a finally takes Sasuke back to Kohona and he pardons Sasuke and he becomes good again and team 7 are the new legendary ninja and Sasuke and Sakura get together (uhh huh) and Sasuke and Karin|`|e8f8187e6742657e8423dea779f096aaaa	sasuke (or whatever his name is) kills his brother or something.

They're perfect for eachother! It would suck if they didn't get together. T.T I think Sakura will end up with NOBODY! XD<br>  {Extreme Sakura hater}<br>  I think everyone in the Akatsuki will end up dying. T.T<br>  They are the evil organization afterall. And in EVERY story, the good guys win. -.- <br>  Sasuke will probably end up coming back to the village after he kills Itachi, even though I'm rooting for Itachi in their battle. Sasuke will try to revive his clan and then the story will be over. <br>  Hopefully the ending won't be that bad though. ^^;<br>  <br>  <br>  Art is a bang!!! ^^|`|E16cnNkmaa	hmmm, well, i  think that nauto should get togther with sakura, sasuke, i think, might get killed by Lee<br>  (off the top off my head)<br>  ant that frog guy i can never remember the name of, (frog sage, pervy sage) will die, or settle down with an ugly woman|`|H6CJ6JVUaa	jiriya will die orochimaru and kabuto<br>  naruto will be hokage then he'll die nad konohamaru will take his place and at the end you'll see him telling narutos kids how he was like o yea and in the ending scenes you'll also see narutos face on the mountain next to his dads!|`|IibJJI4Yaa	naruto will become hokage, sasuke will kill itachi and return to the village as a non-emo. he will apologize to sakura and try to explain things. then they will get married and live happily ever after! yay. naruto and hinata will get married and i think shikamaru and temari will get married(maybe). i think neji and tenten will be together. all of the akatsuki will be killed by naruto. jiriaya should end up with tsunade because that would be cute! <br>  <br>  thats how i hope it will go!<br>  <br>  real ninjas have theme songs|`|On2uuM80aa	sakura and naruto end up together<br>  temari and shikamaru<br>  hinata and kiba<br>  neji and tenten<br>  <br>  sasuke kills itachi and has nothing left to do so he tries to kill everyone and the day naruto becomes hokage sasuke and naruto fight until they are both exhausted and the end up killing eachother<br>  <br>  so the ending is the day naruto becomes hokage he dies|`|Q2fewslraa	must likely pein will and madara will die i don't thick that itachi will die but naruto will end up with hinata and sasuke might return to the leaf but thats just me! o and naruto becomes HOKAGE!!!!<br>  <br>  NARUTO FOREVER!!!!|`|ekActdeEaa	dadura dies, sasuke kills him and sasuke stabs orochimaru with his own sword from his mouth on episode 386 or something and the rest is real long then at 450 or something there is something real bad that hapans so i dont think its gonna end
JVsWSu1Kaa	Well Practice, try playing notes on an instrument and play them bakc, clear the throat before singing and practice to other music. Constantly do the instrument and sing back thing, this should teach about the notes and pitches. Make a own song, which can help, as it will make life so much more easier because you can pick the right pitch and note to the word, it makes it a hell lot easier. Another thing is to practice, practice. You will get good, but you have to start from the basics (listed above) and then find out what type of voice you have a low, medium or high.|`|PpFgz7nraa	it may sound stange but try just singing in the mirror...maybe you could get a singing teacher or even ask your friends to see if it sounds good...when i am singing i press my ears from behind so they come forward that way you can hear what other people can hear! hope that helps|`|ymfBaBkKaa	practice practice practice practice  , practice makes perfect but also try singing lessons get tips from people and ull be great in no time!

I must die in peace, Becky. I slept with your sister, your best friend and our next door neighbor." <br>  <br>  Becky mustered a pained smile and stroked his hand.

vuCo9wZZaa	Well after they came back from last week's elimination Clark was gloating about how she was the best of the group and that it was lonely at the top.  There was a challenge where they had to make clothes that were too large look good and Mckey won it and was awarded 50 more frames in the photo shoot.  That one girl who always complains that she's not doing well was having a nervous breakdown about not being able to be herself around the judges and Sam wasn't very sympathetic.  At the photo shoot they were supposed to be natural disasters dressed in sixties clothing.  Clark came out for her photo shoot and Jay asked how she was feeling and she said in a cocky way "confident."  She completely blew it.<br>  <br>  At elimination Sam was awarded the first photo as she rocked her photo shoot as a tidal wave.  It came down to Joslyn (not sure of the name) and Clark, and they said that Joslyn had more of a personality and they chose to keep her around.  <br>  <br>  Clark was completely floored!  Considering how cocky she had been it was even funnier because she was so sure that she was still at the top.  She's probably still shocked.  She was gracious in her exit interview and said that although she didn't want to go and was sad to leave, that she couldn't be that sad as it was a blessing to have been involved in the show.  She said she would give anything in the world to be able to do it again.  So, she was a little more humble upon her exit.|`|MQaIP3Fzaa	clark<br>  if you want to watch it youtube will probably have it on there tomorrow.|`|PSDTu2BEaa	clark left. they were Los Angeles natural disasters. sam did the best i think

f00af751af4d94ebe6844d97bceca46aaa	I think it's hard for them to put him in the storyline for the new Batman movies. I don't hate his character in the comics though he is an essential part of many of DC comics and Nightwing is the best team leader the Teen Titans and the Outsiders have ever had. He is also rumored to be the next in line to take over as Batman because of the storyline Batman R.I.P. People shouldn't hate him if they have actually ever followed any of the Batman comic book series.|`|0a71d76dfa1ab1ac5d93f86e92f2f955aa	If I remember my comic book history correctly, it wasn't until around 1940 or 1941 that Robin came into the picture (no pun intended).<br>  <br>  In fact, it WAS 1940, as the link below will attest.<br>  <br>  That being the case, it might not be until the 3rd, or possibly 4th movie that Robin (Richard Grayson) appears, if at all. |`|axv4WBmTaa	i love robin! especially dick grayson! i think he is such a wonderful part of the batman family. he's my favorite (except batman, of course).<br>  i would LOVE to see dick in the nolan films, but i doubt that's going to happen. i really don't like the nolan films when i line them up next to the comics, because they're so different and it just seems unnatural. so i doubt dick will show up anytime soon.<br>  but i think the reason people don't like robin is because he jokes around and stuff, and in comparison to how intense batman is, it seems stupid when really it's just natural. i find myself getting really annoyed with tim all the time recently just because he makes jokes, and then i have to step back and be like "tim isn't doing anything wrong!"<br>  i'm really just partial to dick grayson, i think.|`|tsKiikvDaa	I think its because it has been hinted at that batman and robin were gay.  I never thought it but I never really liked Robin because he always seemed to get captured and say goofy things.  I thought that Batman didn't need him.  When he became Nightwing with the Teen Titans I liked him a little better.  I also thought his speedo costume was a little girly.|`|fJ1qPHeBaa	People hate nightwing/robin because he's trying to be like batman. No-one can be batman, but batman.  And that he's a sidekick ;)|`|oBdlGYukaa	ive always liked him|`|NAK0Phshaa	I think true comic book fans know of the importance of Dick Grayson and Robin in the mythos and continuity of Bruce Wayne and Batman.  As well as his importance in the history of comic books.  He was the very first kid sidekick introduced in comics and all others after him were created to try to emulate the original success of the character.  And going by the current RIP storyline, Dick is going to be an even greater factor in the mythos of Batman.<br>  <br>  My theory on why it will be unlikely that we'll see Robin in the new movies... <br>  <br>  Non comic book fans of Batman are only familiar with the young, punning sidekick Robin from the campy tv show, Saturday morning cartoons and the Batman movies from the 90's.  They can't get past the 'Holy -------, Batman!'  That gets annoying after a time.  Also, the new movies are much darker in content, theme and tone.  I think most moviegoers might be uncomfortable watching a violent vigilante taking in a young boy to train as a soldier in his personal war against crime.  In comic canon, Dick was 8 when he started his crime fighting career.  I think that has been ret-conned to 13 yrs old now, but that's still young to be portraying that in a stylized but real-world-looking action movie.  But that's my humble opinion!  Cheers!<br>  <br>

It'll be about as expensive as New York, but a whole lot less hostile.  You'll be less likely to get attacked and killed, and with it becoming winter soon, really, you will *want* to be on the beach.  The only catch would be snagging the plane ticket and still having enough cash to get by....<br>  <br>  Trust me, any *one* of the big three cities (NYC, Los Angeles, and Chicago) would likely mess you up, they are just too big and nasty for a runaway kid.  If you're doing this, go somewhere nicer.  And farther away too.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents.  ^__^  If you're going to do it, do it *right*.|`|VI3pZSKjaa	you'd probably get raped somewhere along the way.  you'd go broke and hungry.  and you'd beg for your parents forgiveness and for them to bring you home.|`|BvBJfHxZaa	Sounds like a school project or something.

KgJqsic4aa	Wow yes it is soo true. Star for youuu my clever friend. ^^<br>  <br>  I think people like to see the dynamics between a group of people and people like music. They like to see how they live their lives and how that affects their bandmates and how they use co-operation vs. egos song writing/touring.<br>  <br>  I think I summarise it mostly as an old saying goes: "Two heads are better than one". In the same way a group of musicians have a burst of personality and creativity rather than just an individual. xD|`|372458a63fdf2cfd5035da966e6ddf39aa	I think the idea that a band sticks together is what gets most people. I mean, humans the most social creatures of the animal kingdom. So that sense of belonging to an elite group (most bands only have, like, 5 members) sounds like a great thing to the average person's subconscious. And when tying the love of music, there's definitely nothing not to love.<br>  <br>  I think I'm looking at this too psychologically|`|Jaf9vkYcaa	The influence of rock music is far-reaching, and has had significant impact worldwide on fashion and film styles.<br>  <br>   Its impact has been positive as well, with the trend of many rock stars facilitating charity events such as Live Aid Songwriters like Pete Townshend have explored these in their work.<br>  <br>   The common usage of the term rock god acknowledges the religious quality of the adulation some rock stars receive.|`|pevh5EiSaa	I loved being in a band, the music, the drugs, booze and of course the girls...whats not to like about that ?<br>  Seriously though, when the group of you all click and that one song comes out just right it is like an orgasm..., aint nothing like it.|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	I agree with you completely, but you need to add that they are a sort of "light" in tough, dark times.<br>  <br>  Wow.... that sounded like something from Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter, lol.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	They have a way to almost reflect or mirror my thoughts, feelings, emotions, that make me connect strongly with them.<br>  Their musical sounds are to my liking and... even looks or personalities are a bonus.|`|7B2s7maWaa	I agree with you first of all.<br>  <br>  For me though is when I can relate to the lyrics and music.  When the band can captivate my attention through song or video.  How they sound if they sound interested and passionate about what they are doing.  Bands are special to me because of their diversity.  Their being able to explore diferrent genres.  Also when they can relate to the music and tell stories with their lyrics.  The most important thing that makes a band special to me is when they put their heart and soul into their music.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	I agree with you. <br>  <br>  For me, it's when the melody and the lyrics are just so amazing, you say, 'wow',  it hits you and you know you love that band  straight away. I also like a recognizable vocalist. Oh, and some originality. |`|cVqCryr6aa	Dude, very few bands actually do all that.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	 I think we love "bands" so much because they are everything that most of us want.  They have the fame, fortune, talent, and creativity.  It really is rare to find a group of four or five guys that really gel so well and sound so good together.  Sure, there are hundreds of bands out there, but people flock to the bands with personality.<br>  <br>  Take my favorite band, Queen, for example.  <br>  <br>  John Deacon (bass) - Really a pretty bland, boring guy.  He was a brilliant songwriter and bassplayer, but never had the charisma to make any noise on his own.<br>  <br>  Roger Taylor (drums) - Good drummer, good vocalist, and had star potential, but alone, we would have never heard his name.<br>  <br>  Brian May (guitar) - Great songwriter, brilliant guitarist, good stage presence, very camera friendly, but never seeked the attention and fame.  He stayed in the shadow if he could, and never wanted to draw attention to himself.<br>  <br>  Freddie Mercury (vocals) - The man who made the band.  Freddie Mercury, in my opinion, was the one who made Queen relevent.  His stage presence, personality, and charisma made thousands of fans flock to concerts, and is the main reason why Queen still has so many devoted fans.<br>  <br>  Four guys with the same musical talent and taste, find eachother and gain the love and dedication of millions of people around the world.  I think a great band has to consist of more than good musicians, but they have to be good friends, have good personality, and have to be willing to lay their lives out for all to see.

Give me a break, it is hardly. <br>  they are good, kind of.<br>  Good plot and yes it is catchy. But Breaking Dawn just ruined it.<br>  I'm a fan, but not obsessive and  not a "psycho stalker fan" :D<br>  You should read them,but you'll probably be disappointed  |`|duupRLplaa	it's a catchy story and a catchy idea of a plot.

Edward is meant to be - though not all agree - the perfect romantic. Jacob is the other spectrum, where a person has all the kid-like fun they want. It's really just Meyer's manipulation of emotions that gets me. Really, when you think about it, it's not a TOTALLY original storyline (but that's nearly impossible to accomplish), but it's a unique twist to an old idea.<br>  <br>  Meyer's specialty is simplicity. She is able to appeal to many because she can manipulate without complicating the reading; Steinbeck, one of my other favorite writers, was also known for his simple style, which may be why I like her writing so. But, with Twilight in particular, I refer to it as my "Warm and Fuzzy" book. Lol. Then, in New Moon, I bawled when a certain someone left, because I was actually in character. I had taken on Bella's attachment to said someone, and was therefore torn apart that they left. Even after their departure, I myself became "numb". Meyer's simple, as I said, but she's often not considered a "good" writer, but an effective one. She often recycles phrases and descriptions, but I almost think that enriches it, since there's consistency. Whenever I hear the word Twilight, scenes automatically flash through.<br>  <br>  Lol, WOW...I know, I know. I WAY overanalyzed the books, but it's so hard to explain...in the end, you either like it or you don't. That's it plain and simple.<br>  <br>  When I read Twilight, I get totally engrossed in it and get lost...the added fact that it's set in an ACTUAL place let's readers really feel more connected. We can actually go to Forks, and look at the greenery, or go to First Beach. We can stand there and think, "This is where it all happened."|`|IbUCcENhaa	I know these are geared towards teenagers but I am 33 and I loved these books.  My niece who never reads anything read all 4 books, twice!<br>  <br>  I think the reason that they are so popular is that there are many different facets to the stories.  These are stories about love, friendship and family.  These books pursue the fantasy of how far would you go to protect and be with the one you love.<br>  <br>  The fact that there is a love triangle and a tremendous amount of sexual tension, without being sleazy (these are geared towards teens), doesn't hurt either! LOL|`|gebh6ayXaa	Obviously if a book is popular, it's a very good book. I've honestly never read any of them myself, but I'd like to. I don't believe vampires exist, nor does my aunt who looks forward to reading the books when they come out in stores. I also cry over books, mainly because it takes my mind down the road that the characters have traveled. Normally those types of books deserve to be bought and read, just because they're just that fun! :)|`|HP1xPocvaa	I personally can't see what's so great about them. <br>  I read Twilight and sure it was entertaining. I read it and then yeahh.. it ended! It was actually very predictable. All they do is run around and tell each other they love each other. Then they run from the bad guy, who fools the girl .And then her lover (the vampire dude) rescues her. Totally. 100% Predictable. The plot was extremely weak. I have no idea why it's so popular but it's driving me crazy. Yepp.<br>  <br>  (: |`|c3AX0Rt6aa	I have not personally read the books but my older sister said she liked the plot and that it was kinda a romance series ive tried to read them all my freinds have but the first one is kinda boring in the begining|`|1pZAoR5maa	I guess its worth getting pneumonia the same way people freaked out about harry potter. Plus most teenage girls love that whole guy protecting the girl thing and the vampire deal makes it "dangerous" which I personally think is overrated.|`|ZfOZEzGHaa	The book is amazing.

I'm interested in seeing answers too|`|8pKQfyC3aa	Ugh. I'm terrified to even see how many fan girls will be sitting in the movie theatre with "I LOVE Edward Cullen" apparel on them. <br>  <br>  Basically, the story is an undying forbidden love saga that appeals to practically every demographic of the female portion of the human race, excepting a small percentage.<br>  <br>  I'm only into the books because it provides a reasonably acceptable fantasy story. The whole romance before all else mentality is just a little too hardcore for me, but whatever. I'm sure that all of those people who are actually in love with the main character are probably appalled by my bashing of the book which is more mild than I feel it could be, but to be quite honest, the books are just the hopelessly romantic's ideal relationship wherein the helpless female finds her ONE TRUE LOVE and they'll be together forever and ever until the end of time. |`|EbInCDHEaa	they're not that good actually, they're just popular because it turned vampire smut into a kid's book, and thus appealed to the huge number or ridiculous teen girls, who have spread it like the Plague amongst their gossipy selves. the plot is ok, but the books get worse the farther you go along.<br>  another thing that makes it appealing to most fans is its different take on vampires. they have vampires that do not burn in sunlight and are not harmed by garlic and crosses and crucifixes and so on. most people freak out about how "unique" and "cool" this is, but honestly, it been done thousands of times before. <br>  all in all, most of the fans are girls, who like it because they themselves fantasize about falling in love with a perfectly handsome guy, who will never grow old, and has crazy vampire strength and abilities (speed, and such)|`|uPpWK7JGaa	I don't understand the hype. Me personally, I have been reading since I was 7. So my idea of a great novel, might not be the same as a person who is just getting into a book because it's the new trend. I do applaud her for getting more young girls to read, but I'm just not into the whole vampire, love crap. I prefer a good action-packed horror fiction novel, or a(n) (auto)biography, or just a good ol' classic book.<br>  <br>  They say it appeals to teen girls, but being 17, my mindset is much higher than a lot of girls my age.|`|f77638df19b856e06b377813782f45faaa	I think it appeals to a lot of girls , because when they are reading it they are imagining that they are bella swan and a  apparently a hot vampire , who can kill you is crazy  about you and tries to protect you .|`|MwiBGBK1aa	I haven't read it yet. I have some friends hassling me to  but I'm a little scared to get sucked in...|`|7B2s7maWaa	Twilight is my favorite series because the story of angst, love, heartbreak, never  ending devotion.  It's hard to explain the story right.  I could try but I would miss so many key points.  For me the story is wonderful because many girls can relate to Bella's character through her relationship with her father Charlie or through her crush on Edward.  I personally love the book because Stephenie Meyer created a beautiful love story with bite.  The characters are another one.  Many people relate to the characters.I relate to Bella because of my personality and certain things I have been through in my life.  I won't lie I have a fascination with Vampireism but I don't claim to be one.  The books just relate to a life for the most part. |`|2c4e6005843e2624086af284a2e71120aa	I don't really know either. I just read enough to know it's utter crap. Bella, for instance, reference's Edward Cullen's perfect looks over a hundred times, in the first novel. What happens if all that is taken out? |`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	Just like Interview With A Vampire, The Lost Boys, and Twilight, people are fascinated with vampires, and the possibilty of being beautiful and living forever.  Nuff said.|`|EcZJcWZvaa	I'm not sure but I know people that have re read them a couple times.

ZmGOL8kCaa	The whole thing on General Hospital with the aliens. I wasn't even watching General Hospital back then, I just heard about it from my mom and my brother. (General Hospital is my favorite show, but that was a little farfetched.) I also thought it was very unrealistic that Jerry/Mr. Craig got away with the whole Metro Court thing, I mean they had a picture of him that matched his face, but all he had to do was claim to have the same plastic surgeon as "the guy who actually did it".<br>  <br>  And that thing where they made it so one year of the show was a dream on Dallas.

XqfH76PMaa	Here is what I found<br>  <br>  <br>  While there have long been rumors as to the cause of these cheek craters, they are not the result of a tribal scarification rite.  In fact, in the same way that Klum, Seal’s wife and mother of their two children, is the textbook image of beauty, Seal’s appearance is the classic example of a relatively rare condition, discoid lupus erythematosis (DLE).  Seal has revealed in interviews that he was afflicted with this syndrome as a teen.  A condition where the immune cells attack various body tissues, DLE usually affects young people. Intense inflammation develops in the skin, particularly in sun-exposed areas.  If not treated aggressively with sun protection and anti-inflammatory medicines, Seal-style scarring can result.  Not only did it cause the cheek scars, but he had significant scalp involvement, causing hair loss. The singer's condition has been in remission for years. <br>

He's younger than me and worships the ground I walk on. rock on. you will be old sooner than you think. The years just fly by, the older you get, the faster they go!

0AIGhZiIaa	I think she was over-exposed to the media and everything she did was scrutinized by the public and criticized. Anyone would be a little nutty after that ordeal.|`|Y29OiWJbaa	Psycho!!!<br>  nothing normal about her|`|05aKFYl5aa	she used to be normal but now shes gone a little crazy|`|w4FDp0cgaa	i Personal <br>  think she a strong <br>  young <br>  women <br>  who <br>  has put up with alot through whole life <br>  she isn't a bad person at all <br>  and she isn't psycho . <br>  <br>  can you please answer my ? <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As.TYWtW6e3ZPDndQaBk__Xsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081116085935AACT8nU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  |`|vOFdHvlvaa	I completely agree.  Yes she's had some rough times, but she's comin back from that and is makin a big comeback in her career now that she's through that rough patch.  I LOVE BRITNEY :D.|`|7LCqjgpeaa	psycho!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|Xm24FpSlaa	normal |`|PxjTIEilaa	As much as I dislike Britney Spears I believe she is a normal person and is just going through a rough patch. Having the public see it all happen doesn't help and probably makes it harder on her. Plus they add things in and twist the truth.<br>  <br>  I honestly believe she is a good person and a good mom, people just need to stay out of her business for a little while. |`|7ymCQYxMaa	the definition of a psychopath is someone without a conscience so no she is not psycho. she is just a normal girl who was given a lot of fame and money at a very young age and like other child stars she crashed. she is working through her psychological and physical problems and is back and better than ever|`|gDpjQVSqaa	Emily,<br>  she has had her ups and downs. some people think she might be a "phycho" because she shaved her head, dropped her baby, etc...<br>  but i do agree with you that she is very strong. I applaud Britney for her outstanding comback in blackout! The past couple of years has been hard for her and i think it's great she has a new album out (womanizer).|`|XqfH76PMaa	Neither.  She has a mental problem.  That keeps her from being defined as either.  But, I think it is wonderful that she has gotten help and is doing so well.  I hope she keeps up the good work!|`|UDwxpV1Zaa	Normal, just stressed.<br>  I'm not surprised, I think we'd all be like that if we were watched and judged 24/7.<br>  |`|668381621f1c3e6cae920248dd38b977aa	I think she is just being human. For ppl she may seem psycho but to her she might feel normal. |`|iJJlQAeRaa	she used to be psycho like right around when she made gimme more. but she made a cumbak|`|tplsDlMuaa	Well, I've never met her and I don't want to but truthfully from what I hear she took drugs, married a guy who only loved her fame, has two kids she can barely take care of, a seventeen year old sister who I heard is pregnant AGAIN, and she shaved her head because she was stoned out of her mind and lowers herself through the music she sings and the things she does! She's nothing but a desperate popstar that people don't really care about anymore and she's doing anything to get some money and attention. How is she an independent, strong and normal woman when she doesn't know real life! She is definately PSYCHO!!!!|`|hsNXQ11Haa	I really don't think that there is a thing wrong with Brittney Spears.  I think that the episode she went through was a gimmick in order to boost her popularity and to gain the sympathy of the public.  In essence that trick was used to boost her sales and advertisement with everything else in turn with boosting her riches.  We all need to get a grip and know when our emotions are being played on by these so called stars who are really everyday people out there trying to make a buck however they can at all cost.|`|d3TNNoVXaa	Britney Spears is normal, but she did do some physco things but that is what anyone would do if you had cameras in ur face all day, and no privacy.|`|ApwYfDYiaa	I totally agree. She's probably so stressed from being in the spotlight for so long and being judged every second of her life. She just needs some time to relax and catch her breath. I love her music! :)|`|DkQfD6KZaa	being a celebrity sometimes f*cks your mind up. look at michael jackson for instance|`|3nN2SQRjaa	TOTALLY NORMAL.|`|V6weyNAjaa	I think she's normal but had a psychotic breakdown, but is now over it.|`|9medQozYaa	psycho|`|ofKCu0HXaa	She is normal inside, but she want to see all that is crazy.|`|SJDj1hmEaa	psycho,idk whats wrond with her,but she has some serious problems she needs to take care of|`|a6Ki9j5waa	psycho but i like her new songs like toy slodier, gimme more and womanizer|`|bB3OVbnxaa	omg i feel the same way! she is amazing and beautiful and back!|`|WLrXiQU3aa	I agree. It's just a tough period in her life. She'll overcome it.|`|FWvhlqxdaa	yeh....i think she is psycho....but media and herself made her psycho..<br>

rkEOMr6Haa	I didn't marry for money, nor did my husband have any when we married.  We aquired a small fortune together, all of which he considered to be his.  Going from a 40K household income to a multi-million dollar business in 5 years went to his fat head.  The money we made together destroyed our marriage.<br>  <br>  Anyone who believes that money will make them happy, when they aren't already, is seriously mistaken.  Only those who have had the luxury of a seven figure income can understand this fully.<br>  <br>  Now I have much less than a six figure income and I'm the happiest I've ever been.<br>  <br>  Marry for love.|`|6frCIiOmaa	The truth is this: If a rich guy agrees to marry me with no pre-nup I'll marry for money, but cheat on him:).....We ARE being honest here, right? Love, is great, but it don't pay the bills.|`|RutYdLAcaa	Love<br>  Screw money. Money cant replace love and affection for your whole life.

BcpWzGiMaa	yes, because at work, you get very tired and stressed. Here is where you get very moody to anyone. |`|qCCx5rsdaa	I would say my personality is the same, fun-loving, happy, kind, humorous, both at work and off the clock. I act like more of a goody goody church girl at work. No one knows about my personal life if I can help it. I swear and party a lot of the clock. My bf also tells me he acts the same way at work because all his co-workers are goody two shoe kind of people.

I talk a lot when i'm home or around friends. <br>  <br>  IDK, i guess i like my co-workers to think i'm very responsible, easy to be around with and not give them reasons to talk sh! t. At night i also enjoy a social life, just very different than at work/school. |`|Z8mc8SS7aa	(Gemini) <br>  <br>  No I am same everywhere i.e. easy going and fun loving. |`|plBXp91Daa	Depends how my mood is if i'm tired i can be mean but normaly i'm sweet and laidback. Where i have worked couple of weeks i met no one who was mean to me but i don't know their star signs.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Yes, because when you are at work, you get very tired and stressed.

I looked forward to it because people were in good spirits and I was allowed to drink tea on Christmas.  When I grew up, I still did, all the way through college and my first job... because there were casual celebrations and people were happy... everything was easy.  But, when I got to the point where I had to be in charge of putting together plays, performances, and dinners, the coordination of it all wearied me so much that I never enjoyed Christmas anymore.  Christmas used to be, simply, the celebration of Jesus' birth and the gathering of family and friends.  But now, it feels like people are trying to put up a show and it's all so fake, not to mention that it puts a ton of unnecessary work on me.  Say it was for a good cause.  But, no, it's just to satisfy those who want to feel good about themselves.  The whole point of it is gone and I wonder if God is sitting there thinking, "I hate these celebrations you are working so hard on because for a whole year, you have not extented mercy to those who needed it and did not fight for justice to defend my people."<br>  I get so tired just thinking about it.|`|ELkprAhPaa	no i'll be quite sad and depressed without him<br>  <br>  Miss you most at christmas time <br>  <br>  The fire is burning<br>  The room's all aglow<br>  Outside the December wind blows<br>  Away in the distance the carolers sing in the snow<br>  Everybody's laughing<br>  The world is celebrating<br>  And everyone's so happy<br>  Except for me tonight<br>  <br>  Because I miss you<br>  Most at Christmas time<br>  And I can't get you<br>  Get you off my mind<br>  Every other season comes along<br>  And I'm all right<br>  But then I miss you, most at Christmas time<br>  <br>  I gaze out the window<br>  This cold winter's night<br>  At all of the twinkling lights<br>  Alone in the darkness<br>  Remembering when you were mine<br>  Everybody's smiling<br>  The whole world is rejoicing<br>  And everyone's embracing<br>  Except for you and I<br>  <br>  Baby I miss you<br>  Most at Christmas time<br>  And I can't get you<br>  Get you off my mind<br>  Every other season comes along<br>  And I'm all right<br>  But then I miss you, most at Christmas time<br>  <br>  In the springtime those memories start to fade<br>  With the April rain<br>  Through the summer days<br>  Till autumn's leaves are gone<br>  I get by without you<br>  Till the snow begins to fall<br>  <br>  And then I miss you<br>  Most at Christmas time<br>  And I can't get you<br>  Get you off my mind<br>  Every other season comes along<br>  And I'm all right...<br>  But then I miss you, most at Christmas time<br>  |`|cEJGIhucaa	Yes, because it's the first Christmas I will have ever celebrated in my 30 years. <br>  No, because I can't afford to spend it with my wife, 3200 miles away in Canada, and I can hardly afford to mail her a gift! |`|b7raN3sbaa	No. The economy is probably going to begin collapsing when no one spends money on gifts. |`|OH9iAKM2aa	no, christmas is the time of year when everyone is happy, except for me|`|LAIC5Yvyaa	Every year.

E8rFixesaa	D.Gray-Man. Allen Walker is an Exorcist in 19th century Europe. He, along with other exorcists, use weapons called Innocence to battle the Akuma - demons created from the souls of the dead - and stop the Millennium Earl from bringing about the destruction of the world. Each of these innocence takes a different form for each exorcist, enabling some to fly, others to shoot from their arms, and others to use a hammer that grows into different sizes. One of the best ways to see if you would like this anime is the opening theme. Here's the first opening:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khhI2EdEbJE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khhI2EdEb...</a><br>  First few episodes are a little slow, but then you get addicted to it and it gets better and better. Its funny, exciting, and even gets sad at times. I even found myself with tears in my eyes when this girl died and I am not the crying type. When you start seeing people called the Noah, it gets really exciting. Watch it, its awesome. Im picky with anime, but this one got me addicted.<br>  <br>  You can watch the series here:<br>  <a href="http://ani2d.net/A2Forum/ucp.php?mode=login" rel="nofollow">http://ani2d.net/A2Forum/ucp.php?mode=lo...</a><br>  <br>  I know that its annoying that you need to make a username, but it helps prevent the anime from being removed because a lot of them are licensed. On most other sites, most of the D.Gray-Man episodes have been removed. This is the only site I know that has all the episodes and its in high quality and WIDESCREEN. You should watch your anime there since it has the best quality. After you login, go to home, then theatre, and select the anime from the RQ list meaning regular quality, since there is no high quality version. However, it looks high quality to me. The last few episodes aren't on the site for some reason. There are supposed to be 103 episodes and its rumored that they are making a new season next year once the manga has progressed enough since it caught up last month.<br>  <br>  What helps is if you check the average rating of the show at tv.com by typing the show in the search bar. D.Gray-Man got an 8.8.<br>  <a href="http://www.tv.com/d.-gray-man/show/69680/summary.html?q=d.gray-man&tag=search_results;title;1" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/d.-gray-man/show/69680...</a><br>  <br>  Here are other openings to help you see if you like it:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbdT2gtQjbU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbdT2gtQj...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qdoBaJWowk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qdoBaJWo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT5-9gBEWwc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT5-9gBEW...</a><br>  <br>  Elfen Lied is also good. It was the goriest anime I've seen but there is nudity. Dont be turned off by that because there is nothing sexual. You can also watch it at ani2d.net <br>  If you like heads being chopped off and arms being amputated, Elfen Lied is the one for you.<br>  D.Gray-Man though is a must see.|`|nuAD0yuIaa	Alright.

A story about a prodigy who finds a note to kill whosoever name he writes... and the battle between him and the worlds most brilliant detective... the last couple of episodes are sort of disappointing, but this anime is DEFINITELY worth the watch.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Action/ Sort of Emo theme I guess?<br>  <br>  Darker Than Black. A very depressing anime at times, and terribly brutal at times. This is my favorite new anime :D<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|hVU94XKdaa	DBZ.

However, what are YOUR ethics? In America its an absolutely gross thing for cousins to do the deed, but in other parts of the world such as Japan it's completely fine. In terms of biological factors, it is  completely ethical no matter who says what. The reason why siblings having sex is such a big no-no is the fact that their child will often have disabilities due to genetic factors. It's been proven that it is completely safe to have children with your cousins, and that it in fact, helps prevent bringing in  any hereditary diseases into the family lineage.  So, I would say, yes... depending on what kind of sex. The thing with this is that you didn't specify what kind of sex. Sex is ABSOLUTELY UNETHICAL unless you do it with someone you TRULY LOVE and if you're COMPLETELY PREPARED and NOT JUMPING INTO IT. <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I don't care how many people are gonna give me a thumbs down for this answer but i am prepared to take this risk to prove that cousins having sex should NOT be considered incest<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|wz8gx3gaaa	IT is called incest which is not only illegal but a greatst sin.|`|dTtY0iLfaa	Cousin means sister & you want to do sex with your sister!!!<br>  SAME ON YOU!|`|kej0H1AXaa	Not if you're drunk|`|OvrcKRQzaa	yeah... ofcourse!!

12dbe0c730df949603fbf1739aea81e2aa	Family Business <br>   <br>  starring Sean Connery<br>  Dustin Hoffman<br>  Matthew Broderick<br>  Rosanna DeSoto <br>  Music by Cy Coleman <br>  Editing by Andrew Mondshein <br>  Distributed by TriStar Pictures <br>  Release date(s) December 15, 1989 <br>  <br>  Jessie McMullen (Sean Connery) is a widower, a tough guy and most of all, proud of his past as a career criminal (now semi-retired). He raised his son Vito (Dustin Hoffman) to follow in his footsteps, but Vito went straight once he had a son of his own, Adam (Matthew Broderick).<br>  <br>  Over the years, Vito became ashamed of his family's criminal past. He has tried to raise his son right, which in his mind means keeping young Adam away from his deadbeat grandfather. Little does Vito know that this strategy has backfired; the mystery surrounding Jessie has caused Adam to idolize him.<br>  <br>  Now that Adam is grown, he is bright, good-looking, successful in college with a scientific grant and without a criminal past. So when he approaches Jessie with a scheme for a burglary, Vito is shocked and disappointed. He warns his son not to pursue this crime and even slaps his face to drive home the point. This pushes Adam even closer to his grandfather, who can't wait to take a shot at a million-dollar payday.<br>  <br>  Vito is distressed, but not disinterested. The more he hears about the scheme, the more tempted he becomes to have three generations of McMullens embark on one great criminal adventure. And, in the process, he can watch out for Adam along the way.<br>  <br>  The plan backfires horribly when Adam dashes back into the building to retrieve an important item, setting off an alarm on his way out. Vito and Jessie can only watch helplessly from afar as Adam is captured by the police. The only way for Vito to get his son's sentence reduced or suspended is to inform on his own father.<br>  <br>  |`|Y4RS35M7aa	It's "Family Business" with Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman, and Matthew Broderick.  It's three generations of New York crooks.  The only downside of the movie is that it has the most god-awful musical score ever put on a film.  if you can ignore that bad music, it's a pretty good flick!|`|LsI20dsXaa	There was a 1986 movie At Close Range.

S51x5vK3aa	Gershwin geh?rte anfangs auch zu den Schlagerkomponisten, die typische schmalzige Songs in der Zwischenkriegszeit schrieben und dabei haupts?chlich auf die Jazz-Harmonik und seltener Jazz-Rhythmik zurückgriffen, was damals in Nordamerika sehr popul?r war. Als Gershwin bemerkte, dass sich seri?se und bekannte Jazzer für seine Kompositionen interessierten, vertiefte er die sog. Klischees aus dem Jazz in seinen Stücken. Das führte dazu, dass er der "afroamerikanischste" (jazzigste) Schlagerkomponist seiner Zeit wurde. Schlie?lich lehnten Maurice Ravel und Arnold Sch?nberg ab ihn zu unterrichten, da ihm Unterricht in europ?ischer Musikkomposition angeblich geschadet und seinen jazz-orientierten Sound ruiniert h?tte.<br>  Auch wenn seine Vorbilder aus der damaligen zeitgen?ssischen europ?ischen Musik stammten, schrieb er zunehmend nur mehr jazzige Stücke für Orchester, wie "Can't Take That Away From Me".

gJhwH335aa	Hmm... I'd recommend on reading Vagabond. The art is really beautiful (because the mangaka draw a human in a good proportion instead of manga style of drawing). The story is extremely good. You can read the series here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Vagabond/1/01/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Vagabond/1/01/</a><br>  <br>  Personally, I think this is the best samurai manga ever created because of its level of realistic. They don't relies on a super power or abnormal looking villain to be great. This is how samurai life should be and they're potrayed nicely by the mangaka.<br>  <br>  The second one is my all time favorite manga and I highly recommend on reading this one (especially after seeing your echi + violence combo up there). You must read Ryuuroden - The Legend of Dragon's Son. The series has a a lot of cool strategy/tactical battle, lots of cool move/power, lots of cool villain, basically anything with the series is breathtaking (well for a shonen and fighting manga fan like me they are XD). You can start reading it here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.anime-source.com/banzai/modules.php?name=Manga&rop=display&chapterid=2874&pagenumber=3&totalpages=71" rel="nofollow">http://www.anime-source.com/banzai/modul...</a><br>  <br>  However, they only translated up to Vol 15 chapter 56 so far and I heard there won't be any more translated after that TT,TT due to their lack of scanlators (and how underrated the series is). There has been a petition for this series to be put up at onemanga last year, but they haven't take any action yet TT^TT You can still give it a read it tho...<br>  <br>  Both the series is historical kinda genre. I highly recommend both of them. <br>  <br>  Other series you might like is Berserk, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure because both series also has extreme violence on them.|`|HUee9mo1aa	hmm, i was going to say hellsing.<br>  <br>  damn, there goes my chance at being helpful XD<br>  <br>  I havent read any, but I hear the BLEACH manga is awesome|`|NMISt7gEaa	o try Highschool of the Dead<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Highschool_of_the_Dead/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Highschool_of_th...</a><br>  <br>  btw i love all those manga XD|`|8ox8avUHaa	Hi!

Triple fry." and then we drove away. <br>  I was really mad at him</3<br>  But it was funny later on I guess.<br>  We aren't together anymore JSYK<br>  *hugs* |`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	No, but I used to work the drive-thru at McDonald's and they had a female automated voice that would come on when a car pulled up. After they place their order and what not I would come on, and I have a very deep, Darth Vader sounding voice and with younger crowd I'd get a pretty good laugh after hearing the female voice.
