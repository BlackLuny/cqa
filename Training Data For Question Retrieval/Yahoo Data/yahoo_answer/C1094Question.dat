Its dark blonde, almost brown. I have a few questions to which I would really like your answers and suggestions, pleeeeeeease!      1. How often should I wash it? Its really thick, and I thought every other day, but I heard it gets weaker if you wash it too much! How often do you?      2. I have a full fringe, but my parting seperates it, so its like one really thick side-ish fringe, and a strand of hair on the other side! How can I get it to go totally full, stuffing the middle parting?      3. Does straightening your hair everyday make it wispy, weak and hard?      4. It gets really static. Literally, I brush it and it goes Wooosh and seperate hairs fly upwards. How can I stop this?         I would really love your suggestions, and even if you arent one of the first answers, dont not answer because I will see it and I will try all of your tips!!      Thanks in advance! Love P xxx

I took a picture but don't how to load it on here...  Anyways, my soon-to-be fiance doesn't have a whole lot of $ to spend on a ring so I was thinking about giving him my ring and saying that he could just take out the redish one and put in a diamond.  Would that be worth it?  The stone is 1/4 of an inch by 3/16th of an inch. I have no idea what size karat stone or whatever that is.  it would probably be a decent sized diamond.  I'm just wondering if it would actually save him/us money in the long run.  Can you just buy a plain diamond and have it set in a ring?

20090205123402AAv3Fw9	Beauty & Style;Hair	What can i do about my dry hair?	Well my hair has been highlighted blonde for the last 12 years. When i went to get my hair dyed an auburn brown colour (after letting my roots grow out and it looked awfull) my hairdresser has told me that my hair is very dry and that i should only wash it every 2 or 3 days. The problem is that i have horses and by the end of the day my hair stinks of horses ( and tends to get rather greasy at the roots from my riding hat) and so i need to wash it every day. I put plenty of conditioner in it aswell but it is not improving. I have used plenty of different shampoos and conditioners and have even stopped straightening it!!! what can i do to improve my hair???

20090205135457AAqX0gN	Beauty & Style;Hair	I want to dye my hair red but...?	I don't think it will last.   I have naturally strawberry blonde hair. I recently died it brown but I really want it a really red colour like:       http://www.style-hair-magazine.com/image...        http://images.movieeye.com/store/images/...       first of all, will I be able to get it dyed that colour. I know red is hard colour to have your hair dyed and I'd really rather not have it bleached first.      Second, I'm not sure it will last very long as my hair hasn't seemed to take the brown very well. It just doesn't seem to hold colour. Any tips on how I can keep the colour for as long as possible.     I am planning on having it done at the hair dressers.

I've been thinking about getting mine done, but I am TERRIFIED that I won't be able to handle the pain. I watched my friend, who's a big baby and freaked out when he got his tattoo ( my tattoos were fine), and he seemed to be in so much pain but three days later was going on and on about how much he loved them. I have my belly button (no big deal), two holes in each lobe, and my cartiledge done. My cartiledge is giving me some healing issues, but other than that is fine.      My question is, is it worth the pain? I don't want your opinion on whether I should get them or not, and I don't care how you think they look. I like the way they look. I know that there is very little risk of them affecting breastfeeding, and I would clean them every single day.      So, after my rambling, whats your opinion?  Worth the pain, or no?

So I just bought them, and I was wondering if you're supposed to stick one on your face, or are you supposed to rub the medicine off on your face or something else. The pads don't really stick on your face, so I don't know what to do. Also, do the pads work? I have acne, and blemishes, so I'm really hoping they work! Oh, and what face wash would you recommend before using the pads? Would jut body soap work? Or should I use Noxzema face wash?   Thank you!!!
