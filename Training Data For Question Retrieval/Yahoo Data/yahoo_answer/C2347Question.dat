20090304124929AAu6lxQ	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Please help, Emergency please please please!?!?	What is the meaning of this poem?   Frederick Douglass       A HUSH is over all the teeming lists,    And there is pause, a breathspace in the strife;    A spirit brave has passed beyond the mists    And vapors that obscure the sun of life.    And Ethiopia, with bosom torn,    Laments the passing of her noblest born.       She weeps for him a mother's burning tears-    She loved him with a mother's deepest love.    He was her champion thro' direful years,    And held her weal all other ends above.    When Bondage held her bleeding in the dust,    He raised her up and whispered, "Hope and Trust."       For her his voice, a fearless clarion, rung    That broke in warning on the ears of men;    For her the strong bow of his power he strung,    And sent his arrows to the very den    Where grim Oppression held his bloody place    And gloated o'er the mis'ries of a race.       And he was no soft-tongued apologist;    He spoke straightforward, fearlessly uncowed;    The sunlight of his truth dispelled the mist,    And set in bold relief each dark hued cloud;    To sin and crime he gave their proper hue,    And hurled at evil what was evil's due.       Through good and ill report he cleaved his way    Right onward, with his face set toward the heights,    Nor feared to face the foeman's dread array,-    The lash of scorn, the sting of petty spites.    He dared the lightning in the lightning's track,    And answered thunder with his thunder back.       When men maligned him, and their torrent wrath    In furious imprecations o'er him broke,    He kept his counsel as he kept his path;    'T was for his race, not for himself he spoke.    He knew the import of his Master's call,    And felt himself too mighty to be small.       No miser in the good he held was he,-    His kindness followed his horizon's rim.    His heart, his talents, and his hands were free    To all who truly needed aught of him.    Where poverty and ignorance were rife,    He gave his bounty as he gave his life.       The place and cause that first aroused his might    Still proved its power until his latest day.    In Freedom's lists and for the aid of Right    Still in the foremost rank he waged the fray;    Wrong lived; his occupation was not gone.    He died in action with his armor on!       We weep for him, but we have touched his hand,    And felt the magic of his presence nigh,    The current that he sent throughout the land,    The kindling spirit of his battlecry.    O'er all that holds us we shall triumph yet,    And place our banner where his hopes were set!       Oh, Douglass, thou hast passed beyond the shore,    But still thy voice is ringing o'er the gale!    Thou'st taught the race how high her hopes may soar,    And bade her seek the heights, nor faint, nor fail.    She will not fail, she heeds thy stirring cry,    She knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh,    And, rising from beneath the chast'ning rod,    She stretches out her bleeding hands to God!       Paul Laurence Dunbar

I am thinking about transferring to CALS at Cornell University with 3.7 (something like that) GPA.      The question is that, in one of my classes that I am taking right now,  the professor told us on the first day that he does not give A's to students unless they do super good in class. He added "which usually doesn't happen". I thought he was joking and just trying to scare us first but I took the first test and it was insanely hard. The questions were pretty much all essay questions and there was no way that I could make an A on the test. But I am not sure if I really really can't get an A. Maybe he gives a big curve at the end or maybe extra credit projects or something.(none of them was on the syllabus) so I wanted to ask him about it. But he stopped coming to class all of a sudden and now we have a sub. Tomorrow is the deadline to drop this class, and we don't know our grades. How great is that? Even universities do not know what he is actually doing right now. He might be sick or else.       Anyway..should I drop this class to maintain my GPA? Do universities care so much about withdrawing when it comes to transferring?

She think that some of us are lazy but MOST of us do try but she still do not give us a nice grade. We may have done the assignments but if one thing is missing she would fail us and the grade scale or grading percentes may not be the problem. Students would fail just over ONE assignment they didn't have or because of her mistake in giving us the assignment.   What do you think?

Even though tap water is still cheaper than bottled water, people still buy them.  A bottle of water would cost around 50 cents to a dollar.  Tap water costs so much less.  There are many advertisements such as commercials that show the world should recycle more.    Most bottles of water are made in plastic. These plastic bottles all end up in our trash.  Since they are plastic, they don’t decompose.  In 2003, it is estimated that there have been 15 billion bottles used. There has been a prediction that in 2011, there will about a volume of 175,000.5 millions of trashes. There was only a little amount of bottles that were recycled from that amount. When those bottles don’t get recycled, they pile up and cause environmental problems.   If we want to use bottled water, we have to recycle them unless we want to use tap water. There wouldn’t be a purpose of buying them if we just put it anywhere. It makes so much wastes like in California, there were a bunch of soda and water bottles piled in the dumpster all in stacks. It looks all dirty and filthy.    What people of the world can do to stop this crisis is we obviously start recycling. When ever we buy some bottled drinks, we should recycle them or if you want to make some money, you can return them at those bottle refund machines where they still get recycled. There are many easy ways to recycle and help our environment.    So as you can see, our world would be better and cleaner if we recycled more frequently. Those plastics that are recycled could be turned to other wanted needs. It would take less space and make garbage easier to decompose. Our future would have a cleaner environment if you pitch in.

20090304133405AAfdsEj	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	My friend is being forced to do something she shouldn't have to in school?	Okay so, my friend Kayla was in gym today, and was told the class was going to do some dance segments for gym in the next few weeks. Guess what she was told they were doing first? They would be learning the dance to Soulja Boy's song "Crank Dat". Thing is, they weren't learning A dance to the song (as in an original piece), but the dance Soulja Boy dances, which happens to be vulgar and rude. Kayla was told she had no other options, and that this was a mandatory thing.      What I (and her) would like to know is, is this even legal to do? First of all, this is gym class in school, not a local dance academy. Second, she is being FORCED to do the dance, which if she would've been religious, would go against her religion (she's not though). Is there any way she and her parents could address the school on this matter, because she's distraught and doesn't want to dance to that kind of a song and thinks this is unfair.      Thanks in advance.

This essay is really important to me and it would really help me alot if you can try and help me correct it or fix it in any way to make the best essay out of what i have written, i really dont want to show it to teachers on anyone like that because its kinda personal, but if you could help it would mean alot to me.               When I hear the word hero, I immediately think of someone who is charismatic, has strong charactoristics and ablities, and someone who is intelligent with alot of superpowers.  These things all come to mind because as a young child, everyone is programmed into watching tv shows about famous super heros, or reads comics about how "The big super hero saves the day!" From such a young age everyone tries to be the next superman,spider man or even the hulk. Everyone looks up to these fictional charactors and wants to be exactly like them. Young childern often act out and pretend to be their favorite superhero. To me a hero is not someone who has superstrength or invisible super powers, but someone who is an inspiration, a person who makes one want to be more like themself, a person who enlightens others and spreads good advice and thoughts onto others. My hero is my mother.                 My mother would always lend a helping hand to anyone who needed it. She was there to be a shoulder to cry on, and help me get through tough times. Although my mother was very sick throughout her life and had many problems with her liver she always tried to help and smile through the pain. She spent the majority of her life in the hospital and I never understood why, until a few weeks before her death. She told me that at the age of 25 she had been infected with a virus called HIV which stands for human immunodeficiency, and that after time it turns into the disease called AIDS. She also said even though there is medicine that helps slow the disease down, that it was still an uncureable disease. She told me "not to worry, and that everything was going to be ok." A  few weeks later my mom was sent to the hospital.  I thought it was just another check up, but it turned out the be the worst.  My mother passed away the summer of 2008, I will never forget that day. My grandmother got a call from the hospital that said that my mother wasn't doing so well and that my family should go see her as soon as possible. On the car ride to the hospital I was planning on things to say to her, I was going to tell her that I loved her alot and no matter what happend in her life i would always love her.  I walked into the room that my mother was staying in and everyone's face was pale, I wondered what had happened, and then I feared for the worst. The doctors slowly walked in, and my heart was pounding, before the doctors could even say anything, I realized that my mom had passed away. I didn't want to believe that I had actually lost the only person in my family who I loved and cared for the most.                   Accepting her death was an uncomfortable and painfull feeling. I had hoped that day would never come, but when it did, I was frozen, I couldn't move, I didn't really know what to do. For years my mother had been the strength that kept my family together, and without her I didn't really know what the future would bring. Even though the loss of my mother has affected me deeply, I realize that I cannot change the past, but I can possibly alter my future. I see her death now as an inspiration. She taught me everything I know. She was a strong woman who was compasionate about everything she did. She taught me how to be caring, how to have a good time, and taught me to become a better person, while at the same time, embracing and accepting the person who I am. She was a very important person to me and I will never forget her.               With this experience I know now how important it is to actually be there to comfort somebody, and to be there when they need me the most. From this experience I learned how not to take things for granted, because one never knows when they are about to lose everything they’ve ever had. Life is short, so I am going to live mine the best I possibly can. This experience has inspired me to join social groups and help others cope with their troubles and their losses. No one in life has it easy, however by expressing myself through speaking, taking life one day at a time, and living in the present, it makes me feel that I can accomplish almost anything. I hope one day to be an inspiration to others. I want to be a role model that people can look up to. I want to be there for others when they need a helping hand or a shoulder to cry on. Just like my mom was for me.                I hope that one day scientist will come up with a cure for HIV/AIDS. So that no one in their life time will ever have to suffer through such a painfull disease, or have to watch one of their loved ones try and survive through this disease. Many people have made donations and started fund raisers towards the AIDS foundation

Students of Axia College are able to use these tools during any period of the day. These tools help the students to better understand the lessons in their courses. An example of two tools are the digital stories and audio appendixes. These tools allow students to feel connected to the classroom. Digital stories also help the visual learners, while the audio appendixes help the audio learners. Another tool Axia college provides are tutorials. Tutorials help students to achieve excellence with their schooling by interaction. I feel Axia College has created a fair and equal learning environment for all students by adding these assessments to their online college.      The ability to download appendixes in audio format helps to improve my educational experience. As an auditory learner I am able to gain more from the audio format, then I would be able to by just reading the appendixes. Audio format could also be more convenient to other classmates who have items such as an iPod or a mp3 player. This would allow those students to take the appendixes with them wherever they needed to go. I am thankful for the ability to listen to the audio appendixes provided by Axia College.

I need to write a 3 page paper on minstrelsy and I really need a good grade. Is this a good start? Any suggestions would be appreciated.      Minstrelsy had its beginnings in the 19th century, and appealed to the whites of all classes as a form of entertainment, but also as a form of white supremacy. The sense of community that being entertained by exaggerated characterizations of African-Americans gave whites a common ground in spite of social or economic class. This is the environment that minstrelsy was able to flourish in and although the medium provided African-Americans a platform to use their creative skills, these caricatures effectively instilled the exaggerated image of these performers into the minds of most Americans, the consequences of which we still see today.

I'm starting to get rally depressed about this one college class I'm in. I can not seem to do well. I end up with a lot of D's and C's on the quizzes so far, and I'm really worried because the practical is next week.          it's my biology lab, and it is a three hour, one credit class. The professor does not use a book, notes, or power point, and he just talks the entire three hours. He does not write anything on the board.         I try to take notes on everything he says, and I outline them into a neater better format. I also research on some of the topics I don't understand, and I'm careful to learn vocabulary. But I still do not get the grades I want.        I am spending way more time studying for this one credit lab than my other more important classes. I want to have more time to study for other classes. Does anyone have different study techniques, or note taking strategies? Maybe I am missing some things he says.         His quizzes are all on miner details, instead of the main ideas of the lecture. I have been trying to schedule a meeting with him for weeks, but he keeps having to cancel it. Thanks for any advice. I usually get really good grades, and this is really bothering me now.

20090304133252AAgnFgd	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	An Inconvenient Truth in elementary schools.?	I recently learned that my fifth grade sister's science class watched Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" for the last few days of class. Am I the only one who finds something wrong with this? I mean, if you believe in global warming, fine. If you don't, fine. But it seems that elementary schools are increasingly becoming ways for individuals, or more specifically Democratic politicians and thinkers, to force their opinions on children. I really don't see how this biased movie, one who's credibility was brought in to question by some scientists for manipulating data (mainly by altering the axes of many of the graphs to magnify minute changes in temperature and carbon emissions) is relative or even understandable to 10 year old children. I truly feel that if we spent more time teaching more math and "real" (physical) science in schools, instead of focusing so much on educating them on the ecosystem and how horrible humans are to the environment, that maybe we wouldn't be so far behind the developing nations of India and China in math and science. (India and China by the way have some of the world's worst pollution standards and couldn't care less about the environment.)       Anyway, I just wanted some feedback on this topic, and would appreciate any opinion.

Here's my concluding line.      "So I encourage you to make an effort to be kind, even to those you don’t know, even to those who aren’t kind to you. Because these random acts of kindness can encourage others to do the same, and perhaps, make the world a better place."

20090304152433AAO9JBD	Education & Reference;Other - Education	What classes should I take as a senior?	Hello. I have a question about registering for next year. To give some background detail (I don't know if this matters), I living in Southern California and my school isn't the best school to go to in our district, we're more of towards the bottom of the list.      I am a junior registering for my classes next year as a senior and I'm wondering what classes I should take. I have finished my one year arts requirement, one year career education requirement, went pass the two year and instead did three year of foreign language (Up to Spanish 4, and now the next level would be AP Spanish which I know I'm not ready for so I won't take), and have taken three years of college prep science (biology, chemistry and physics). I'm not sure if for my electives, I should freely pick ones of my interest or if I should follow through with a second year of arts/career education. Is it necessary to go pass the requirements for arts and career education? Would colleges really pay attention to those?      My electives for next year, so far, I am definitely taking a fourth year of math, but I need to pick more electives than just one. Do you have any recommendations as to what sort of electives I should take? I am basically done taking the classes or have gone pass the requirements I need to graduate. Should I just follow up now with what I'm actually interested in? Like perhaps teacher aide, marriage and family, etc. Or would colleges want me to pass the requirements for art, etc. too?      Thanks!

20090304150209AAmuZ2i	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Help for Highschool (serious answers only)?	Okay, this is going to be long, so be prepared!      I am in 8th grade, so high school is right around the corner.   I want to either become a writer (books and movies), a    veterinarian, or a (human!) doctor.  I know I am smart    enough for any of these, but I have procrastination    issues, and I am bipolar so I sometimes get really   frustrated in school and cant learn, which I am   working on.  If I want to become any type of   doctor, I would have to get a good scholarship.   So I am determined to do as well as humanly   possible in high school!  I also am worried about   making friends.  Because of my mood issues   and my family life,  I have trouble.  I started   at a new school and drifted away from my old   friends.  I am interested in politics, reading,    animals, and music.  I am not like a super-serious   person or anything,  I just am afraid I will end up    with nothing.  I get mostly B's, some A's, and   rarely C's.       So to my question, what can I do to keep up   a high average, make better study skills, and   do okay socially?  I make friends easily,   I just have trouble keeping them and becoming   closer.  And I HATE history class, which pulls    my grades down.  I LIKE history, just not the   classes.  Would this affect my chances of getting   into medical school? If it does, how can I do better?   I need as much help as possible!

20090304151648AARQoFE	Education & Reference;Other - Education	How do I tell my parents about my bad grade?	At my school in the middle of each semester they send home an interim if you're either doing really good or really bad in a subject. It's kind of like a progress report sent home to your parents. Before they actually send it home they let you have a copy to show your parents so that they know what to expect when the interim does come in the mail. This semester I got an interim in English saying that I have a D-. My teacher said that the reason I have a D- was because I didn't turn in any of the big assignments that she assigned. (There were 3) when in reality I actually did turn in 2 of them. I talked to her about it and she double checked and realized that I did turn them in and told me that she made a mistake and that I wasn't going to get marked off for that. She already sent the interim so my parents are probably going to get it either today or tomorrow. What do I tell my parents when they read it to see that I got a D- even though I didn't really? How do I explain to them that the teacher made a mistake? My parents are really strict about grades!

The type of career I see myself going into is advertising or perhaps marketing. I am thinking about majoring in psychology or sociology, what would be best in getting myself into the careers I want.   I am really worried because I hear a lot of people complaining about psych and soc degrees about how hard it is to find a job and how you get really bad pay.   However, the good thing with my program is I can major in an arts and I have business courses as well. Also, in my second year I will be adding a speciliazation in digital arts communication.   I want honest opinions please, I know a degree in business admin would maybe be easier but everyone is doing that and I want too stand out. Also, I think that my degree would be more versatile.

20090304153717AADNcIP	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What college/university do you think I should go to? Any suggestions?	Hello. I am a junior in high school, soon to be a senior and I don't really have any colleges/universities in mind, nor do I have a career in mind.      Currently though, I'm thinking along the lines of teaching in a high school as a U.S. history teacher. But of course, I'm not entirely sure and really my choice might be changed if another career pops up in mind. Not really sure if I would want to be a history teacher.      My GPA stands at around a 3.52 GPA. I have taken AP U.S. History and so as of first semester, I had a B+. I have finished my A-G requirements. I am currently in trigonometry, planning to take pre-calculus in my senior year. I am also currently taking physics and have already finished biology and chemistry, not planning to take another year of science. AS for my foreign language (Spanish), I have taken three years of Spanish in high school and one year in junior high, finishing all of the levels of Spanish offered in high school and now if I want to continue Spanish, I'd have to go into AP Spanish (Which I'm not because I'm not too good at Spanish). I'm finishing up my one year of arts and career education this year and not planning to take a second year of either. I have yet to take my SAT I and ACT, which I am planning to get done by the end of this year.      As for community service, I am currently in KEY club with over 20 hours done, not too much but hopefully I go to more activities to gain more community service hours.      I am looking for a college/university in Souther California. One that has both male and female and is diverse in ethnicity and religion. Do you have any suggestions? And if possible, please provide me the link to that college/university.      Also, I want to get a master's degree and attend a four year college/university.

The way he sings the song makes me play it over and    over as the words go, style of your hair, shape of your eyes and you nose, the way you    stare, as if you see right through my soul.

If I met a guy who plays this song for me I don’t know what I would    feel. All the words in the song melts my heart. Songs are known to make you cry, laugh   or think.
