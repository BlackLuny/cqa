Hi all,       I can't get freeview in my area, despite having a digital tv, unless I change my aerial which would be ï¿¡100+. I don't mind spending that, but started me wondering because my wireless router is situated right behind my tv. Is there any way I can receive the freeview channels via the internet? I've got a funny feeling that the answer is no and a man will be on my roof in the near future, but thought it would be interesting to ask.

20090131085228AAt7J0D	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Access point with DHCP?	Hi, I'm looking for a wireless access point with advanced DHCP features. For example the AP has static IP (10.0.0.2) and it can assign dynamic addresses from 10.0.0.10 to 10.0.0.254. That's the easier part of course, but the most important thing is that I want the hosts not to use the AP as Default Gateway, but another router on the same subnet, with static IP (like 10.0.0.1)   What AP do I need to do that?
20090131085949AAOGvrJ	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	When is PHP6 going to be released?	I have several sites written in classic ASP that I need to convert to a modern language. Problem is everytime I start learning ASP.NET I get to a point where I know I can do something using fewer lines and less time with ASP or PHP and begin to question ASP.NET.      The problem with PHP is it is too much like classic ASP in that it can allow really sloppy code (a problem I am not too worried about - I have refined most of my sloppy ways with ASP). I hear/read that most of PHP's shortcomings will be solved with PHP6.      I am not a web developer by trade. I am a system administrator for a SMB that uses alot of open-source, ingenuity, and a lot less cash than our larger brethren to do the same tasks.      Therefore, my gut tells me PHP is the way to go but, if I am going to really learn PHP then I feel it is useless to learn the current version of PHP only to have to re-learn it when (if) PHP6 comes out!      The problem with waiting is I have been reading about PHP6 since 2006! Is PHP dead or dying? I looked at Ruby and RoR - I didn't like it. Ruby, Python, and their ilk seem like flavors of the month. I have played with Cake and CodeIgniter but, the whole MVC thing is too much to learn right now.       What would (did) you do?      TIA,   Charles

From what I've heard, they are better for people like myself, who use the computer primarily for web surfing, downloading music and other entertainment applications.      Are Netbooks really as good as they seem? Are they worth it? What makes them different from Notebooks, just the memory? Will they work well for downloading music?      Any info appreciated, thanks!

20090131094624AAqayT7	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	How can I prevent radio interference with my PC speakers?	Alright.. I have some nice 2.1 Logitech PC speakers, and they totally beat the crappy ones built in to my monitor. Ever since the start, the speakers got interference from AM radio stations. And it only gets worse,, the radio station I usually pick up is a freakin' religious radio station and i can sometimes faintly hear "...of our lord jesus christ..." and crap that i dont want to hear because i am an aetheist..(no offense to religious people). My question is.. can i get rid of the interference? I have seen many forums about people with this problem, but even googling the subject, i couldnt find a legit diy project i could do to fix the interference.      When i have the volume up, the interference goes down to nothing, but when playing games or doing homework at night when i have the volume down low to listen to music or whatever, i can hear the annoying interference.      Please give me a link, or tell me something i can do to fix the interference. I am good at building pretty much anything, so...      and right now, i hear religious music, must be a church program playing at 10:45 that no one listens to... i feel sorry for those people who have to put all the programs together that no one listens to.      OH AND 1 LAST THING! i have tried the ferrules around the wires that help prevent the interference, but they just don't seem to work. mabey if i wrap the wires in aluminum foil.. hmmm.... that's a thought.

Ultimately I was wondering if I could run that card, an i& (the most basic unit), and all the other fixings of a computer off the 500w, but if you could just give me consumption that would be fine too.

(btw since then i have checked it many times, never gone above 35c, checking with bios and CoreTemp) otherwise it just runs a little slowly.

My PC is a custom built piece of kit that i got for christmas from someone i know longer see, i recently had a vicious virus and have formatted the pc, however now i find when i play game i average 7-9 fps, and i'm pretty sure its because i formatted all the drivers along with the pc. after endless hours of searching for drivers i only managed to find the graphics card driver and my mouse scroller driver (lol) the reason i can t find the drivers is because all the sites i've visited have asked for the makes and models of the hardware. how can i find this information out baring in mind i have no documents for the pc what so ever.      thanks

20090131112455AAluLLJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I spilled milk on my macbook. HELP!?	So I spilled a little bit of milk on my 5 months old macbook. Around an ounce, maybe less. Computer did not turn off or anything of the like, I cleaned it with a tissue as far as I could get. I went to class when I got back, my "enter" and "shift" were a bit sticky so I cleaned them with a Qtip and they seemed to be perfect. All day computer worked normally. Next morning when I turned it on the colours were all faded. It was not that bad, but I could def tell the difference. I went to class when I got back colours were still the same, not as vivid. I turned off the computer, turned it on again and it was back to normal. Turned off again and turned it on and it was still normal. Should I be worried? What would you guys do? Do you think it is gonna get worse? Do you think the colour fading was somehow related to the spill or was it just a coincidence? Please help my mac is my baby :(

20090131113236AAtLy65	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	How do I set up my home network so that my ATT DSL  moem will pass-thru to my wireless router?	I have a Motorola 2210 DLS modem/router with only one port. I bought a PS3 and a Microsoft MN-700 wireless router. My computer is hardwired to the router and the PS3 is wireless-G. The PS3 is connected as is but to function properly it needs a "NAT Type 2" connection. I followed all steps from lots of boards about opening ports and DMZ but nothing works. I think if I disable my router function in my DSL modem and pass the WAN IP address to my router, it may fix the problem.   However, when I do this, I lose all connectivity. What do I need to do to make my router be the sole router instead of translating IP twice(once in the modem and again in the router)?   Please help get me up and running.   Thank you!

My heart is set on buying my first new laptop, but I absolutely refuse to buy one with Windows Vista installed (I've had really bad experiences with the OS). The problem is that now like 99.9% of new laptops come with Vista pre-intsalled.      I've been told that Dell and HP are still selling laptops with XP installed but my problem Dell/HP can't ship outside US, and I personally don't feel safe ordering such expensive items online.      Now I know people have bought laptops with Vista, and then down-graded them to XP. The process, I've dicovered, can become complicated if you attempt the change yourself, and it can leave your laptop unfunctional or even damaged.      Any ideas on how I can get a new laptop with XP installed?

20090131130532AAqZleN	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Whats wrong with my web server?	Well i know a computer isn't the best thing to be using as a web server but when ever i try to go to the website using the link i made from dyndns.com it either (says: the connection to the server was reset, but the page was loaded) or if i do it on the local machine my router login pops up). I have tried these 3 programs to run it bizarre 2 server ,WAMP server, and networkactiv. And i edited the host file also. and ever since I chaned OS's from xp to vista (I changed back to xp of course) im getting this problem it used to work now it doesn't and i have the same exact OS i did when it worked. Does any one know whats wrong ? I'm guessing the hosting file in windows/system32/drivers/ect  but i changed it so that i had my dyndns added to the internal ip ,external ip , and the localhost ip (127.0.0.1).

20090131135553AALFrNJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Which Laptop? Dell or Sony?	I've been looking at laptops and I cant really decide between the two companies-dell and sony.  For dell i was looking at either the xps laptop or the inspiron.  for sony i was looking at the vaio laptops-im not sure which one of those i'd get, i was thinking about the cs because i don't really want a real large screen.  Because of my parents divorce i'd prefer the laptop to be light weight-easy to transfer-, able to play games(such as steam-if anyone knows what that is), and school work-im going to go off to college soon and want it to be practical for that also.  I also liked the idea of of it working as a tv-the family dell computer does that-i think dell laptops do that but im  not sure on that.  But i don't know which one would be better for me.

Of course I want to do something that hasn't been done yet and I have 2 Dachshunds [aka weiner dogs], so I was thinking the creatable characters could be Dachshunds and my dogs, Murphy and Maggie, would be the mascots and possibly the namesakes of the site.  What do you think about this idea?  If  you don't like it, do you have any other suggestions?      Also, I hardly know anything about CSS and HTML coding, does anyone know where I can take a class on this [in Houston, TX] or of a program I can buy to learn it?  I can hire someone to do it for me, but I thought it'd be fun to do it myself and save money.

However, later columns (which are dependent on original data, not any intermediary answers described above) round numbers to the nearest 10's. I have checked, rechecked, and even worked out the equations I have typed into excel.    Example: My solution should be 8.71, Excel is giving me 10. This is happening to an entire column of my solutions. They are rounded to the nearest 10. I didn't do anything differently.

20090131110633AACsmXA	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Is an external hard drive RAM or ROM?	I thought RAM can be read, erased, and written over by the cpu. An external hard drive is only read by the cpu. If the user wants it to be erased or written over, they have to do it himself/herself.      So, is the distinction between RAM and ROM dependent on whether it's the cpu or the user that alters the contents?      And what about the types of memory that the user can't alter - the critical computer instructions - that are burnt into the main memory. Is that just a different type of memory all together, or is it a subset or ROM?      I'm kind of confused and I can't find the exact answer to my question online. Any help would be much appreciated.

Hi,      Please dont tell me about e-bay as i know about that (i sell on it) but is there anywhere else i can make money on the internet?       Please no dodgy websites where you just ' answer a few questions and they give you ï¿¡500' as they are pointless and stupid.      If you are going to mention e-bay can you tell me some stuff to buy, then sell. the categorie or item.      im 14 but am pretty determined if there is money involved. tell me if there is any other stuff for any age group, it doesnt matter what.      Everything's a help and i just feel i am wasting my time doing nothing. I may aswell be trying to make some money rather than doing nothing.      Thanks in advance, only serious answers please.
