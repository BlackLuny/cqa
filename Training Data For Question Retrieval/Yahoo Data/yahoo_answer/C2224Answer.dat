It could be your firewall if it is just disable it while your playing games.|`|AA10069553	Well you could get a better computer, delete some things off your computer, get better internet, or only play the game (ie not have tunes and Internet Explorer and Lime wire and Excel launched). Some games have options in the menu that if you turn them off (or down) the game may run better.|`|nlOC41Qraa	If it's lagging, then that suggests you can actually access the game, thus it is not a firewall issue. If it was a firewall issue, then you probably wouldn't be able to see anything at all or even access the site.<br>  However, it is more likely one of tow things:<br>  1/ your computer is not powerful enough - check the minimum suggested requirements on the games website to see if your machine is up to it. Your processor might be slow, or perhaps you don;t have enough RAM.<br>  2/ your internet bandwidth is slow or has a lot of traffic on it. Again, check the game's website and see if there is a suggested minimum bandwidth. <br>  Maybe try closing other programs you have open, or shutting down anything that is also using your bandwidth.|`|yQXbN2xYaa	This is easy.

PtfgIvnHaa	You start by choosing one of the 9 classes ( Death knight only when you have a level 55). To level you have to do quest until lvl 80, but there's alot of instanced dungeon you can go to with a group of 5 people to kill some boss and get some items. The classes are : Warriors ( Tank and damage dealing) Mage ( damage) Rogue ( Damage ) Priest ( Damage and healing) Druid ( Damage, Healing, Tanking) Paladin ( Damage, healing, Tanking) Shaman ( Damage , Healing) Warlock ( Damage) Hunter ( Damage) Death Knight ( Damage and Tanking)<br>  <br>  Proffessions are Mining, Blacksmithing, Skinning, Leatherworking, Inscription, Herbalism, Alchemy, Enchanting, Tailoring, Jewelcrafting and Engineering. Each of them with a 450 maximum level, you get new recipe each five proffession level at a Profession Trainer. You can only choose 2 primary profession, but every of them are useful. There's also 3 secondary profession which you can use without taking a Primary slot, those are Fishing, First aid and Cooking.<br>  <br>  When you level you need to build a talent tree starting at lvl 10, getting one talent point each level. You also get new skills every 2 level.<br>  <br>  There's more than enough quest to go from 1-80 without doing instances and grinding, and it's really easy if you're not stupid. At max Level there's what we call Raids, Where we gather 10 or 25 other people and go kick the crap out of a instance, That's where most of the good loot is, since WoW is a PvE game.<br>  <br>  Also, pvp, You can join battlegrounds starting at lvl 10, there's bracket for every 10 level, like 10-19, 20-29 etc. You get honor point when you win or kill an enemy, and with honor points you can buy PvP items, which are useless until you get to max level.<br>  <br>  Maybe I forgot some details but that's the important stuff, on the top of my head.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S : I can already see people telling me to get a life, and it's just sad thinking that so many people need to say that to MMO players, just to feel better about themselves :P|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	Lol ok so this is a HUGE question, but I'll give you a little info.  WoW is a little more geared towards PVE, but the PVP isn't bad (it's not great either, for the best PVP I recommend Warhammer.  There are professions like skinning. mining. fishing and about ten others, but you could play for months and never get involved in that aspect (or you could start from day one, but don't expect them to make you money till the higher levels).  If you want to RP then get on a RP server when you first join (they are identified as RP servers in the server type).  There are normal servers and those dedicated more to PVP, it's all up to you which you choose, but ganking is way more common on the PVP servers, think of the normal servers as a truce state and the PVP servers as being at war.  Hmmm, I am trying to think of things you might want to know just to get started, but I think those are the biggies, the classes are based on your general RPG archetypes for the most part.  I would recommend finding a helpful guild from the beginning, just shout in a capitol city and someone will invite you to one, or if you want you can come to my server "Gurubashi" and PST me "Cyvus," I'm usually pretty good about answering questions.  Oh, if you do decide to do that though, realize that Gurubashi is a PVP non RP server, so you won't find role playing but if you like the idea of being safe while out exploring or question, then PVP servers aren't for you.  Oh and just so you know, Blood Elves, Night Elves, and Dreanai (sp) start in the middle of ******* nowhere, it's really easy to get to a capital from where they start, but it's not as obvious as the other classes,  Good luck in Azeroth!!!<br>  <br>  Oh, I'm Horde on Gurubashi,|`|d4wE7Bynaa	on WoW you can choose wat you want to be ect warrior mage warlock rogue mage you can only change what you want you want to be if you create a new charcter you cant mine fish theiv fish or wood cut on WoW

I really don't know about how much it will cost if you'll ask a professional to do it. Also, there is a possibility that your PSP CAN'T be modded because of some factors like, you've recently purchased your psp and it has this certain motherboard that can't be modded at the moment. Hope it helps.

VqJrKA8caa	Mm, I could be wrong but I thought you could buy the dollars through Second Life's website. If you try buying it from someone through Paypal, I would think there would have to be a level of trust established before either person would consider the idea.... unless Second Life has some sort of built-in system where you can use Paypal to sell linden dollars. <br>  <br>  The sites below might help you get a good idea on how much you can get in linden dollars per USD.... but again, I would be surprised if someone you don't know would be willing to make that transaction. They could probably scam you - take your money and give you nothing - or there is the possibility that you might scam him. (Which is probably a main reason it will be hard for you to find someone that will do this sort of trade). <br>  <br>  I know that I didn't set you up with anyone, but I think the best way is just to buy it through the site if you want reliability.
qqq7IXTVaa	You cannot have two story doors unless you have the University expansion pack installed.  You can't have elevators unless you have Open for Business installed.  A lot of the newer versions of the Sims will show the options from other, uninstalled expansion packs but not have the option to use them until you install the other expansion packs.|`|q3yL0Gruaa	if you want to build an elevator, you have to make the second level first (wall) and the floor, then, put the elevator in the 2nd level. if you want 2 story door, you have to do that as well, especially the walls. hope it's helpful :D
Q2yXaQooaa	For HP/MP, you'll have it in the 3 digits at the end (I think 999). I would say the game varies between 15-35 hours of play depending on how fast and if you're strong enough to directly jump to the time period to defeat the end boss or if you plan to do every quests, find every treasures, etc..

0rpN2419aa	How much do you want to spend?  You will want a machine that has decorative stitches, and I would recommend going to a sewing machine dealer to see what machines would have the pretties decorative stitches.  You don't want to use just a plain stitch, but a machine that I have has lots of pretty lacy stitch designs and you can pick a design to compliment your pictures.  I have a lightweight Babylock that has nice designs on it, but there are lots of different sewing machines  brands and I would definitely advice buying at a dealer so that if you have problems, you can take the machine in and talk with the service person.  They also might have some machines that are perfectly good used ones that people have brought in for a trade up to a machine with more features that the want and you can buy one of those.  Scrap booking can be absolutely beautiful with stitching that is not dense.  Look online and see what you think.|`|0WASp0bHaa	I have not heard any thing good on any the mini sewing machines that are out there.|`|0W8Kcrcoaa	First of all, you need to ask yourself how much do you want to spend and how often you're going to use it.  Check out the stores that sell AND SERVICE machines.  If you buy one from a discount store like WalMart, you won't pay a lot, but will be stuck if something happens to it.  There are a lot of good brands out there -- Singer, Kenmore, Brother, Janome, Bernina.<br>  <br>  Remember, too, that if you're sewing through paper, you'll need Sharp needles, and you'll have to change them more often than if you're sewing fabric.|`|ukkSb54maa	I inherited my mom's cast iron sewing machine and it only sews straight stitch. You might want to check garage estate sales and see if you can pick up a cast iron one or really old that works, since you only want to sew paper with it.  You might find a deal out there. I bought a craft sewing machine and its not worth anything as far as usability, so don't waster your money.

Also, the colored heart in the lower left hand corner needs to be red.<br>  If you have only seen one heart event, it was the purple heart event, so you still need to see the blue and yellow heart event.  Don't worry, do this as long as your heart is higher than that color so you can still see these.<br>  To activate the blue one, enter his house in the morning (after nine since before then he is on  the boat and you cant get to him) on a clear or sunny or cloudy day.  This will trigger the blue heart event and he will tell you about a huge fish he caught.  Tell him "i'll help" or "uh huh" to gain friendship points. <br>  Then you need to activate the yellow heart event.  This one is in the diner.  It needs to be clear, sunny or cloudy.  I think there are also certain days it can't happen on.  You have to enter the diner sometime in the evening.  Also, Lanna appears in the event, so you need to have talked to her before.  <br>  I just did these events to try to marry Denny.  Hope this helps you.|`|p2ctKfijaa	you have to see all the heart events

during one of the cutscenes to get the "happy" ending... and to get the "perfect" ending, you have to have 100% story completion.<br>  <br>  Nothing like that for FFX, though, that game was completely linear, and you couldn't really control what happened.<br>  <br>  I believe I just answered one of your other questions, too... so, good luck!|`|05b0bf32304de53987e6027fe0ff089daa	1.<a

AA11509905	Paintball is one of the fastest growing sports in the country. It is a sanctioned sport where the rules are clearly defined. Strategy and athleticism is necessary to be successful, just like other sports. You need to convince her that you will be responsible with it and only use it the way it is meant to be used. People that have a negative of paintball get it when they see the markers used in illegal ways. This is no different than a baseball bat being used in a crime. Unfortunately, baseball has been around for a long time and developed a postive reputation while paintball has not had enough time to do that. The key is to convince her that you are responsible enough to own one. Good Luck!

ZDyq7vA2aa	You need to have a pokémon that knows dig. Now you go to Route 134, the one with the currents...come in from the east side and navigate them to the south west until you hit a bit of land thats capable of you diving into, once underwater follow the land through til you come to an inscription that looks like its in dots. Resurface there and you'll be inside a cave, go up to the inscription and read it. Then use dig. Go into the room thats just been opened up. Here make Relicanth the 1st Pokémon in your team and Wailord the last, read the inscription at the end and the caves will be opened after an earthquake. Regirock should be found in the sandstormy desert in Route 111. In the mountain, read the inscription and do the following: Go Right Twice, Down Twice and then use Strength and Regirock should appear. Its at Lv. 40 so be preparedRegice, the second member of the Regi-trio, Ice Type...After doing the above mentioned events, fly as close to route 105 as possible, most likely to Muro Town. Surf North-west and you will encounter a cave similar to the one you found Regirock in. Enter it, this task is pretty simple, go to the middle of the wall with the 'braille' inscription in it and press A, wait for a little bit and a door should appear...this could take several minutes so be patient. Go in and Regice will be there. Once again, its at Lv. 40. Registeel, the final member of the Regi-trio, Steel Type...After doing the above mentioned events, fly to the town thats to the east of the Safari Zone. Go to the Safari Zone, but instead of entering go west until you discover a staircase, go up this staircase and you'll enter another part of route 120 (where it's raining), there will be another mountain. Go into this one and once again you'll find an inscription, read it and head to the dead center of the room and use Fly. A Path to the next room should open, go into it and Registeel will be there waiting. Its at Lv. 40|`|mDG3yfxYaa	By farting

The PS3 game is available, but no bundles.|`|Gva3Bwkpaa	It came out on 11/20, 11/30 was just the new shipping date for the bundle. So, you can go to the store and buy the game right now, but you won't find the bundle, and maybe not the game, since today was Black Friday. So, you're out of luck.|`|HGJ3wj47aa	no|`|aOYLyee1aa	i saw it in my best buy today.|`|f3ae1040b2354d276d5c278d5b97300faa	Yes, it is out.  I saw the whole set at Best Buy on Wednesday for $160.
NzE3dNZnaa	You need to spray the plants a lot if they are in a green house no bugs can get in. If you're ok with cheats do boolprop testingcheatsenabled true then shift/right click on a plant and click spawn bugs and it doesn't always spawn the first time but do it too all the plants, put back in play mode, then spray them and it will take a while about 30 or so sprays<br>  Hope you get the plantsim:-)|`|73Qzi3vVaa	who's our daddy and what does he do?|`|QPWmt78vaa	Sure you can goole it|`|36c219280f881fd9a869475fe716cf47aa	In order to turn your Sim into a Plantsim you will need to spray your plants for bugs A LOT!  Don't use the Lady Bug thingy.  Even then, there is a 2% chance that they will change into one.

AA12165015	Yahoo games and rooms open with a pop up.  Turning  off the pop up blockers like Yahoo  says doesn't work very well!  Most tool bars like yahoo and Internet explorer have pop up blockers! When you try getting in lounge or room and it doesn't work. click on pop up blocker on yahoo tool bar. On the drop down list click on Always allow tab it will say recent pop ups blocked. high light Yahoo.com then click allow. On Google  blocker click on blocker and  it will allow site.<br>  . IE browser settings to allow pop ups Right click on Tools, Internet options, privacy tab, cookie over ride. Type in www. Yahoo.com, allow then OK.  If your tool bar has a blue gear with tools beside it, Click on it and a drop down list will have pop up blocker listed.Type in www.yahoo.com, click allow.  It is rare but sometimes the demo can go bad. To check, click Tools, Internet Options, Click Browser settings ,Then view objects. If any are bad it will say corrupted instead of installed. If bad delete it  and load the new demo next time you play.<br>   This is the proper way to use the pop up blocker. I have never had a problem or had to hold  any keys down to get in.  1st thing you do when you get in lounge is check small windows in options box. Once in room make sure you expand it to see chat area. You only see top half of the cards but you can still play. This also gets rid of the big ads at the top of the rooms.

If you have already done this your cakes might just be overpriced.<br>  <br>  PS-- i have never started a bakery but I am pretty sure that they have to be in the "see-through" shelves.

Also see if your anti-virus scans during gameplay..  that also slows it down..

P7Vxq58Maa	Yes, those who have answered are correct.  Keep in mind, however, that having Manaphy will automatically count towards the National Dex, because it is number 151.  Hope this helps!|`|ZDyq7vA2aa	yes the other guy is right|`|kdllaiMfaa	Yes but not wild. Fly to celestic town and go to the house farthest in the back. Talk to the women and she will show you a picture of palkia. That will count for the pokedex
ZDyq7vA2aa	pi|`|sHxwl5nGaa	sure but i don't have WIFI
laFvCp7baa	ok number 114 is unown you gotta go to solaceon town go right ubove the green hous  on the right at the very top of the town theres a path jump down the third and go into the cave then go inside keep going down and there should be wild unown|`|RHADBLwRaa	if i could get a wifi signal i would trade you the combee and drifloon.|`|ZDyq7vA2aa	no 114 is Unown|`|0dVzeI1Xaa	#53 Combee are in honey Trees!!!<br>  #65 Drifloon is in the valley windworks but only on Fridays he is out in the open<br>  #114 Unown are in the Solaceon Ruins in Solaceon City<br>  Hope this helps!!!
ZDyq7vA2aa	no but i think your missing Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie, Azelf lake valor (near Suunyshore) just surf to the middle of the lake Uxie is in Lake Acuity (near snow point) just surf to the middle of that lake and Mespirt  it is in Lake Verity (near Twinleaf town) just surf to the middle but you have to beat the game first t o get all of them|`|RHADBLwRaa	do you mean the last 3 pokemon #148, #149, and #150? Its Dialga, Palkia, and Uxie i think|`|laFvCp7baa	dude tell me the numbers in a diff question and ill tell you where to see and catch them (ive got national dex)
ShAucbudaa	The pokemon rdar doesn't help you get mesprit, but the marking map does. It is a poketch app. You can get it from the guy by the desk on the first floor of the poketch app company in Jubilife City.|`|RHADBLwRaa	talk to the poketech company head on the first floor keep talking to him till he gives you all the apps he made|`|LAFEArMzaa	actually u need the marking map which u can get at the poketech company in jubilife city|`|ZDyq7vA2aa	It's really the marking map (i know because i beat the game)<br>   Marking Map<br>  Location: Obtained from President of Poketch Company after obtaining 3rd Badge
ZDyq7vA2aa	i don't think you can
ZDyq7vA2aa	go to stark moutain the are macargo and slugma|`|fzEdE5f7aa	stark mt magcargo sluma magmar have to migrate
QXub3EzMaa	ive done this before. when u start a new game u can trade non-sinnoh pokemon to your new account. sumtin i would suggest is trading the eggs tht will hatch into the pokemon u want so tht u will b the original trainer and wont have to worry about them not obeying u. o ya and they will not be included in the sinnoh dex if u look at there summary it says "dex number ???"|`|XqA5uEIAaa	in every other pokemon game when u restart u get nothing from any previous games.  I know-it sucks
QXub3EzMaa	to get a metal coat u go to iron island after u get the national dex. u go into the house and byron (yes the gym leader) will be there talk to him and he'll give it to u.|`|1x7NMI5daa	u can find  metal coat on steelix  i can trade u   metal coat  FC: 3780 6030 7635 NM:LordKen|`|WMugH2tAaa	at the house on iron island a guy gives it to u
zV2lKqNYaa	Find the cheats first.|`|YpUhEviCaa	THere would be a cheat section on the tab and it has many sections
lJZNGsZCaa	We did loads in drama, organise a group of people to spell out words like help or sos as if they were stranded on an island with their bodies without speaking. This gets them to think about communication and body language. Try taking puzzles out of IQ books for small teams to work out together to see their problem solving abilities.

Kqpqt69Vaa	you say that you have fallout 3,if you liked that you should enjoy the elder scrolls oblivion.if you get the game of the year edition you get the shivering isles and the knights of the nine which add a lot more game play to an already large world.hope this helps.this is a great game.|`|WbjMz3Pwaa	I would recommend Call of duty 4 as the online is very good, with 10 prestige modes its very hard to get bored. Plus i have cod5 and 4 is definitely better.<br>  Also i recommend resistance 2 as it is another great shooter, which has great online competitive and co-operative modes which take quite a while to complete also.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|ReVbuKslaa	Metal Gear Solid 4, because it's not a regular shooter it's an espionage or tactical game.|`|AA10774661	Noby Noby Boy, Flower, Mega Man 9|`|alyr0SB8aa	Try KillZone 2 or get Metal Gear Solid 4.<br>  KillZone is a lot like Call of Duty, fast paced, though more advanced.<br>  Metal Gear Solid 4 is just fun.|`|SuKS1OQtaa	Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.

Also there are some generators I got em awhile ago before my computer was hacked but you can just put in google search sims2 university serial code generators but please becareful. Hope that helped.|`|cljtObXZaa	Well there are two ways you can do it, the simpler and easier way is to go to their website and obtain the registration keys, if you have registered your game. You can find your license key by doing the following:<br>  <br>  If you registered your game online during installation, or on the Sims 2 official site or the EA Games site then you can find out the license key by logging into your account.<br>  <br>      * Go to www.ea.com and select your region.<br>      * Enter your username and password. This is the same username and password as you use to log into the Sims2 official site to get to the BBS or the Exchange.<br>      * Click on 'My Account'<br>      * Enter your username and password again. You may have to enter your password twice for security.<br>      * Click on the 'My Games' tab.<br>      * You will see a list of all the games you have registered, plus the registration codes. <br>  <br>  The other way to do it is to edit your registry information, but this step is for ADVANCED Computer Users, those who have no idea what they are doing to their computers should NEVER attempt this as you can permanently damage some vital things, anyway here are the steps for the registry editing:<br>  <br>  WARNING:  Make sure that you back up all important files and your registry before attempting this:<br>  <br>  <br>  Go to the computer the game is installed upon, and click Start> Run. In the box, type regedit and hit the enter key.<br>  <br>  Click the little + sign next to where it says:<br>  <br>      * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br>      * SOFTWARE<br>      * ELECTRONIC ARTS<br>      * EA GAMES<br>      * THE SIMS 2<br>      * ERGC <br>  <br>  In the pane on the right, you will see something that says default, reg_sz. In the column entitled Data you will see a string of letters and numbers. This is the license key for your copy of The Sims2.<br>  <br>      * Write it down in a safe place- some people write it on the Sims 2 disc with a special CD pen (NOT a ballpoint pen!) <br>  <br>      * Repeat for the other EPs, by clicking on THE SIMS 2 UNIVERSITY, THE SIMS 2 NIGHTLIFE and so on. <br>  <br>      * When you have finished, close regedit. <br>  <br>  It would be a good idea to write these down and keep them in a safe place- some people write them on the CDs with a special CD Pen (DO NOT use a ballpoint or any other hard tipped pen!).|`|UxWStzQjaa	Call (650) 628-1001 when it opens in one hour.<br>  Tell them your situation and let them know you have all the expansions.<br>  They will be happy to get you a new sims 2 code for your game.

3Iyu7hrcaa	Have they still been emailing you?  Or just a note a year ago, and nothing since?<br>  <br>  Of course you "should" pay them the money, but it wouldn't appear that they expect to ever get it.

QXub3EzMaa	aside from ur legendaries ur team is fine. u might want to get rid of rock slide on t-tar since it alredy knows stone edge. teach it dark pulse insted. also get rid of the moves tht take a turn to recharge like hydro cannon and hyper beam. these moves can cost u. metagross' 4th move should be earthquake. this will help get rid of its fire weakness. like a comment b4 me sed u might wanna get rid of the legendaries if ur really serious about wifi. other than tht ur team is decent.|`|t8ahOhoKaa	can you give the levels other than that the team is good|`|9X2tzr6raa	try catching better pokemon....

nazmgDW1aa	if you use 6mm the fabric will be very loose and the holes rather large so i would think the smaller pins would be better and the size would not vary greatly.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	If you use larger needles, you will have a loosely knit piece.  The lace pattern may be hard to see, since there will be tiny holes everywhere.  I would use the smaller needles.  Measure the gauge after you've done a few inches so you know how the smaller needles affected your work.  That may help you choose needle size in the future.|`|PXWVGQyAaa	Make a swatch using both sizes to see which you will prefer.  Make it 4in x 4in . I did that once with a baby afghan and I liked the lacy look with the big needles and it knit up faster as well.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	if you use a larger needle then the Label suggest then your fabric and pattern will end up looser and bigger, If you use a smaller needle then your fabric will be tighter and the size will end up smaller|`|154dzJ1Faa	A larger needle makes for a looser fabric.  And if you are using a pattern with a set amount of stitches, you are going to make something much too large.<br>  <br>  A smaller needle will make a firmer fabric.  Again, it will be too small for you.<br>  <br>  The thing you can do is use the smaller needle (since it is close) knit with a bit less tension on the yarn, and maybe add a couple stitches to make sure it fits.  But this is really tricky to do properly.<br>  <br>  You really should have all the sizes of needles in your collection (I have several sets of all needles, in straight, double point and circular, in metal, plastic and wooden).  You are not going to be able to do much with only those two needles -- or stick with the same yarn and same pattern all the time.<br>  <br>  If you are doing this lace, just as a stitch pattern, where fit is not that important, then you can use either needle.  You will like one more than the other.  If it is to fit someone, size will be very important.|`|AA12177717	Use the 3.25 mm needles, your fabric will be a bit tighter and you'll have to block it to open up the lace.  Since most of this is solid knitting the larger needles will make the pattern much more difficult to see and look somewhat sloppy.  I think you'll be happier with the fabric from the smaller needles.  In something that is a more or more open lace the larger needles would work.
GDKBqwwJaa	it depends what ride. You can actually write down the # from the photo, go to the main photo place (probably towards the front of the park) and give it to them, then they can put it on a card and you can take it home, go to sixflagsphotos.com and order them from there. They are available for 1 month from the time you enter your photo code, and they usually have better deals. In the park for key chains id guess like $20 for 4 or around there.

deU6EI8Baa	just go to a GTA website, and find the number you dial on your ingame cell. theres a number that you dial on you cell in the game that tells you what song is playing in the background, so next time you hear it, have the number close and dial it and itll tell you, then you can download it|`|tBuzrlSdaa	I just know one grand theift auto song.

6SlSLdWJaa	I assume you mean the Native american, right? Well since Native American land isn't considered a part of the US, they have complete atonomy and are not governed by US law. Therefore they are allowing to have casino on their land even if it is technically in a state where gambling is illegal.

0e4ec90e978769f9222aded1018a21f5aa	From Menethil Harbor run East on the main road out into the Wetlands.<br>  <br>  When you get to the first fork in the road (where the road splits) go South (still on the main road). This will take you all of the way to a tunnel called Dun Algaz. Go through the tunnel and keep following the path.<br>  <br>  You will come out of Dun Algaz into Loch Modan. Follow the main road South all of the way out of Loch Modan (you will pass the town Thelsamar).<br>  <br>  Once you leave Loch Modan you will enter the North Gate Pass. Just keep following the main road (you will enter 1 or 2 more tunnels) and you will come out in Dun Morough (where Ironforge is).<br>  <br>  Stay on the main road heading Southwest. There will be 2 places that you can turn, but don't. Just stay on the main road. Then the main road will start going West.<br>  <br>  Stay on the main road. You will pass 2 more places that you can turn, but don't. Then the main road starts going Northwest and then West again. Just stay on the main road.<br>  <br>  You will pass Kharanos and the road will end and you can either go North or South. Go North and you will come to another fork in the road. Take the path on the Right all the way into Ironforge.<br>  <br>  Ironforge is basically a big circle. So when you get inside, just keep going Right until you get into Tinker Town. Once in Tinker Town, Go into the Deeprun Tram (you will go through a little portal). <br>  <br>  Get on the Tram and it will take you to Stormwind, which is in Elwynn Forest.<br>  <br>  You will probably die a few times, but you will make it eventually.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ca0db37cc242f17eb06d3e3e4612fb74aa	If you can get to Ironforge (dwarf city), there is an underground tram within the city that'll take you straight to Stormwind, which is right inside the elwynn forest.<br>  <br>  Also, you could have a mage friend (level 40 or so) port you to Stormwind.<br>  <br>  Further still, you can use worldofwarcraft.com's recruit a friend feature, and get a friend to start a 10-day account, have them start as a human, join your party, and summon you (which you can do as a linked account once per hour.)|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	That walk is a *****, just type /who Elwyn forest and beg any warlock who is on to summon you, eventually someone will...you'll be annoying, but you will be in Elwyn |`|VHh7Lki0aa	TO THE HORDE!
Ue5NoJOgaa	Buy WoW and TBC online you should be able to get both for like 30 bucks, and you will get a month free.  Then you can pay the normal 15 a month for membership (less if you pay all at once)|`|uctxzjIIaa	Base WoW is $20, Burning Crusade is $20-30, depending on where you buy it, or you can get both together in a BattleChest pack for $40. The Wrath of the Lich King expansion next month is $40.<br>  <br>  Subscription fees are $15/month, though you get a discount if you buy a 6 month block with a credit card.|`|8vGq6cRTaa	First - be sure to read about the new Recruit a Friend campaign - it can get some nice benefits for you and your friend if your friend recruits you.<br>  <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=20588" rel="nofollow">http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.x...</a><br>  <br>  To play, I think you have to buy original World of Warcraft and the Burning Crusade expansion.  They are $20 each on Amazon.  Note - an additional expansion Lich King is planned for November and that is $40.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Then the monthly fee for World of Warcraft is $14.99, slightly less if you pay for several months at once.  <br>  <br>  |`|74002e185008426cc6ea7206fdb80596aa	It's about $30 to get them. Good timing too because you will be leveling just in time for the expansion Wrath of the Lich King. Gonna be fun times. It'll be $15/month. They have packages for if you want to order more than a month at a time. But I think it is either  month or a year. |`|QQ8p7e1Vaa	you can buy both for 30 bucks not with the first month included, then you have to pay 15 a month for the subscription. In about 10 days a new expansion is coming out, i hear its going to be awesome. that'll prob be around 40 bucks. (still the same price per month though)

ooAFJ1zGaa	All you have to do is in your 1st room add buttons. You can make buttons at GRsites.com. They just save them as images and open them in Game Maker as a sprite. You can place the sprites wherever you may like to. Then choose the spite and make the instance whatever you want. In most cases you want it to be mouse left click on object (your button). Then if the button says [start] you can make it go to a new room. If it says [Quit], then you can make it go to a box that says something like "Are you sure you want to leave so soon?".
