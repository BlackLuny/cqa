Because women these days are too preoccupied with "woman power" and EXCPECT things from a man rather than understanding that marriage is a two way street. Men, next time you even think about getting married, just ask all your closest friends and family to dress up, hand you an envelope full of money, and then dive off a cliff. Same outcome as marriage which will inevitably either take your balls away and any happiness you have in life or cause you ongoing financial pain for years on end via divorce, because there is no fair laws with divorce, they are all biased and messed up. consider yourself warned.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	In the UK peopel in general don't want to get married, its seen as boring and old fashioned.

I am over 50 years old, and I have a secret for you: you are never too old to learn new things.  I have just recently started a new career, for instance.

If I can do this, so can you.  <br>  <br>  Oh, by the way, I absolutely love my new career as a teacher!  Do what you love, and enjoy your life.  You are just starting out on a new journey.

HZTzbNabaa	yeah, definitely. If I hate that person. But I make sure I don't go too low because we wouldn't want anything terribly serious.|`|Qnswjc6kaa	Not necessarily "ruining someone's day", but kind of inflicting an emotion on them. I like to bring out new things in people. Like, if I meet some nice, shy, quiet girl I like to see if I can get her angry. I want to see the angry side of her, just to know that she's human, that she has a range of emotions, like all of us, and that she can be anything, like anyone. I've met a few people who I just can't anger, and it feels so bizarre! It's like they're one dimensional. Like they aren't real. I know there must be some feelings buried in there somewhere, but I can't bring it out!<br>  <br>  When you say that you like to "show them what they are", you sound like one of those guys who goes up to random girls and tells them that they're stuck up bitches. Having had experience with this kind of guy, I can say that it's really annoying. I don't think that the "quivering eyebrow of true penetration" is necessarily someone truly reflecting on themselves based on what you said. Even if I was a stuck up *****, if some one told me I was, I'd just be like, "What a jerk! Who the hell does he think he is judging me? What the hell is his problem? What did I ever do to HIM?". So that quivering of the eyebrows may just be some ones attempt at composure to keep themselves from crying.|`|CiHh3Qvfaa	I absolutly agree, depending on the person.

I know that men can breastfeed under extreme conditions when food is scarce. The human body does this as a desperate attempt to save the species.

I can remember loads of specific dates in history, I can get by speaking a foreign language, I can easily do algebraic equations, finish a hard sodoku puzzle in a few minutes and I can even cook a mean chilli con carne, but long division?

They will listen to you talk without bias and sometimes that's all a person needs.  If you're ever contemplating suicide I would reccomend calling a suicide line.|`|EgA87yR0aa	If you call a suicide line, then you are acknowledging your pain is real.

k3ZVZmBJaa	Sociopath is another term often ascribed to people with antisocial personality disorder.  Typically sociopaths exhibited extraordinarily deviant and malicious behavior.  Antisocial personality disorder is essentially characterized by a general lack of empathy, a conscience, and guilt.  In varying degrees, people with antisocial personality disorder act in such a way as to satisfy their own needs without regard of anyone else.  They have no moral direction and they do not think in terms of what is legal or illegal.  Now, some may simply lie to you and stab you in the back at work in order to climb the corporate ladder, while, at the other end of the spectrum, some may kill or rape to satisfy their own cravings.  They do this without ever appreciating that this behavior is morally and legally wrong.  Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, etc. are/were sociopaths who committed serial murders.  <br>  <br>  Because antisocial personality disorder is a personality disorder, it means that the disorder is prevalent and long lasting as are all personality disorders.  It usually develops in the teen years, though some research has argued that conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder in childhood is a direct precursor.<br>  <br>  People with antisocial personality disorder may also learn to adapt and model acceptable behavior in order to fit in with the rest of society.  As such, they can be charming or have an outgoing personality.  In reality, they do not really feel the same emotions "normal" people do.  So, they are not honest; they might be fun on some occasions, but when they want something from you, they will not be fun (they will hurt you).  And, lastly, they are not cherished.  They are feared, hated, and avoided.  Many clinicians choose, if possible, to not treat those with this disorder.  In fact, it is theorized that there is no treatment that can help those with this disorder.  Because the disorder is considered beneficial (i.e. it helps them get where they want without worrying about consequences) by those who have it, it is also theorized that they do not actually want to get rid of it.  A very scary prospect for society.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  Dude, I'm sure you appreciate the attention you are getting from this question, but it is quite obvious that you do not suffer antisocial personality disorder.  You may have a different, albeit attention-seeking personality, but sociopath you ain't.  And keep on smiling, I aim to please.|`|CBVl4Adsaa	psychopaths? a psychopath is someone who will kill someone without a reason and not feel any guilt.. that sounds really fun person to be around|`|odvCFB3Gaa	okay im gonna be totally honest with you.<br>  im very much into psychology and things so i researched it and <br>  a sociopath can be fun but they are not able to feel sympathy for others.<br>  i know a girl that's a sociopath i used to be friends with her.<br>  not best friend thank goodness.<br>  you cant really have a good relationship with a sociopath.<br>  this girl..she messed up people...<br>  she becomes close friends with someone and would hurt their feelings..'<br>  but she wouldn't actually care..<br>  sociopaths will only pretend to care some wont <br>  even pretend.<br>  you cant be boyfriend or girlfriend with a sociopath because if they cheat on you they wont care..<br>  trust me. my friend has a girlfriend who was sociopath and she always cheated on him. sociopaths can seem friendly and normal at first but you cant really trust them..|`|ES15x7EIaa	I think sociopaths can be quite interesting, funny, charming and fun, some can be very dark as well.

DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE! Then I pace around my room and really act out my emotions until I'm exhausted. <br>  <br>  The thing about art is that it has some carry over value.

It's also the way of life for the future.|`|mU2eMSi3aa	Because they don't want to imagine losing what they have.

Ruifi0GSaa	Hi, maybe the first dream was the first stage "Alpha". During this stage our brain waves begin to slow down to anywhere from eight to fourteen cycles per second. And the 2nd dream was the second stage of sleep that is called "Theta" stage. During this stage our brain waves slow down even more, about four to seven cycles per second.<br>  I have done this many times too, wake up and not really awake but was in the dream state still, freaks me out every time.<br>  Hope that helps, happy dreaming :)|`|tISJYHJNaa	OMG! i JUST had that dream like this week or so.

yO6Akf3Faa	My answer is not your typical "go get counseling" or "go talk to your loved ones about it". It is simple and it works excellently. Any kind of martial arts will do the job. You can get your anger out on the heavy bag or on someone else during sparring, all in good nature of course. I do tae kwon do, ju jitsu and a little bit of boxing and they have worked marvels on me. I used to be really hot headed also but fighting is very relaxing.|`|EgA87yR0aa	You need to walk away.  Don't try to fix the situation.  Just tell yourself that they don't deserve for you to make a fool of yourself by hitting them.  Keep a greater psychological distance from people and make them earn closeness.  The point where you feel you should hit them is  a point where you should respect yourself and walk away until they act better.|`|CiHh3Qvfaa	Im not saying you have a problem and you should go take pills but, every night right before i go to bed I take a vitamin called B12.

You can get them at you're local CVS or Rite Aid and they are over the counter.|`|Ug7Om1qyaa	Learn how to channel your aggressiveness through positive energy<br>  instead of negative energy.|`|QT0qTFyAaa	Go get some Klonopin, Xanax and Valium.|`|OncdpDunaa	Plain and simple: Anger Management Classes. But wait... there's more.<br>  <br>  It would not hurt for you to see a behavioral therapist to come to terms with the root cause of why you are aggressive. You might already know and you might not know because it's hidden to where you can't get to it. Either way, having another person's viewpoint (Professional) can open up new ways of thinking, and help you redirect your anger and aggression into a more healthy outlet. If you are concerned about it now, you should do something about it now. Waiting and putting it off is going to cost you friends, family, and maybe even your own well being. Try it out, there's no harm in it. God Bless

6yZV7BY9aa	I suppose, by "water-torture", you mean what is generally referred to as "Chinese Water Torture", which implies the repetitive dropping of drops of water on the forehead of a restrained individual, and not the more modern, and considerably more turpid, "water-boarding". The concept behind Chinese Water Torture is that the drops are randomly timed, and the constant anxiety that is incurred in the victim, always wondering when the next drop will fall, leads to dementia. Also, after drops of water falling on the same place for a long time, it has to get very sore. Also, considering the victim is bound tight, they can't move their limbs at all, which is, I'm sure you know, a terrible irritant, especially if you're kept still for more than an hour or two; even when we're asleep, we're constantly shifting pressure from place to place. So, to answer you question, it's probably a combination of the psychological effects of the randomly timed drops, and the resultant anxiety, and the physical effects of being bound, and struck in the same place repeatedly for a long time.|`|6PBGAp7Raa	because you can drown if you don't tell the torturer(s) what they want...<br>  that's a little more then just annoying. that's if you're talking about water boarding. if you're talking about that other stupid thing it's just a mental thing. it's just F*cks with your mind until you can't take it anymore.

TDHFTxomaa	Unfortunately that is the way that people tend to let creeps off the hook around the world, not just in Africa. I experienced the same thing multiple times as early as age 11. I never dressed provocative or anything like that either and although I looked older than 11 I certainly didn't look a day over 14 at the most. I was routinely accosted by grown men on the street and sexually harassed including luring attempts similar to what you spoke of, and told that it wasn't a big deal or as you said people actually thought that it was funny. This is an extremely tragic element of society, that people disregard the safety and sanctity of women and girls and then when it's too late and something has actually happened to you they blame it on you. Its horribly sad and I oftentimes feel as though  human beings just aren't worth the amount of credit that we give ourselves, especially when it comes to protecting/respecting our women. It is such a shame and I for one have no idea why in such a modern informed era that we are living in today people still shrug these types of things off, or ridicule us for reporting them and then turn right around and blame us when we are raped,abused, and exploited. I feel for you sister, and you absolutely have the right to be outraged. It proves that you are an intelligent woman, with good moral standards and don' let anyone ever tell you differently.|`|2DXXEOrYaa	You should absotutly be angry!!

OncdpDunaa	Hello. If the body is not functioning properly, there may be an upset in the brain signals. Many types of outside stimuli can alter the brains pattern of thinking. If you feed the brain what it is craving, there would be a calming affect just as if a smoker had a nicotine craving and then smoked a cigarette. The brain only knows how to function with what stimuli it is used to.<br>  <br>  The brain can be reprogrammed. It would be a long process including psychologically therapy, and maybe even a change in that persons behaviors and "playground".<br>  <br>  It is possible to become psychologically independent, but again, it would mean taking that person out of their only known comfort zone and working with them and integrating them into a new lifestyle. There's the possibility that the individual may have to have medicine to halt the process of the chemical imbalance, and keep them on a level- headed, calm, peaceful path. <br>  <br>  Have a good night. Hope this helps.|`|BehIVocqaa	A. This is a condition where a person is convinced in his mind that he/she can't do without (fill in the blank) without suffering some terrible consequences (whether it's real or imagined).  The body's physical function is not directly linked or affected by the withdrawal.  Sometimes people get so freaked out by the loss of their addictive substance that psychological function is affected and that can have an affect on the body's physical function, i.e. a panic attack can cause difficulty breathing.|`|HZTzbNabaa	A

JEteneuUaa	Yes.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	a person can die with or without people. people die when they die. just because you have no friends doesn't mean that will kill you. find new friends. figure out why you don't have any more and fix it.|`|c2b69802ef9d960e8e16708b4ecfdc15aa	Well, the way your question is worded, there are two ways it could be interpreted - and I see them BOTH reflected in the responses posted ahead of mine.<br>  <br>  One way - which is really quite absurd, when you think about it - is saying, "Can a person who has no friends still die?"  And the answer to that is, of course, DEFINI(TELY!  If not, then all a person would have to do to live forever is avoid making friends with anyone.<br>  I am sure you meant the second possible interpretation - "Can a person die from not having any friends?"  Logically, one would think not.  I would imagine there are a lot of very old friendless loners out there.  <br>  However, it may be possibe that we die when all our pre-programmed karmic interactions with other living people in our lives have all finally played out to their natural conclusions,  I have long believed that this is why close couples often die within short periods of eachother.<br>  I believed it so strongly, that when my husband died (after 28 years of marriage) in 1997(I was 53 years old at that time), I fully expected to follow shortly afterwards.  We HAD been a VERY close couple, and I fully believed I had loved and lost my TRUE soul-mate, with his death. I believed this so firmly and strongly that my continued survival was something of a puzzle and surprise to me.<br>  But then, I learned that new people can enter our lives - bringing the potential for NEW karmic interactions - at ANY time.<br>  Six years after his death, I met a man I loved even more than I had ever loved my husband.  I would never have imagined I would actually meet my true soul mate when I was 58 and he was 69, but I DID!  Now, I am mourning HIS death (just about two weeks ago) and do not know if I will survive him by much or not.  If I do, I will know it is because there is yet anotherrelationship or unfulfilled purpose left in this life for me.<br>  <br>  You do not mention your age, but most of the people on here are considerably younger than me - I'm 64 now.  If there is one thing life has taught me, it is that it is NEVER too late to change a condition in your life that you don't like.  I will be very happy if I die soon and join my late love in the afterlife, but I am also open to the possibility that there may be even another love "out there" for me yet before this lifetime is over. <br>  So you see, it is NEVER too late to make new friends.  You don't know WHAT events lie ahead for you in your life-script.  You may make lots of friends, you may save someone's life, you may find the great love of your life - after all, I have had TWO of those so far.<br>  <br>  Don't lose heart.  you could go out and make a new freind tomorrow, and another the next day, etc, etc.  It is ALL up to you!|`|sB9xp8wraa	People who are truly without friends are cursed with eternal life.
ONWCXzUMaa	Some doctors call them sociopaths, others refer to them as psychopaths. Either way, the terms are used to describe individuals who have a range of personality disorders. These people are not certifiably mentally ill; they are biological carriers of socially and personally problematic traits. Such traits may have been manifested from childhood on in acts of cruelty to animals, property or people. These characteristics can disrupt relationships, create financial and emotional crises, and, at their worst, lead the person to callously undertake acts of vandalism, theft, rape or murder. Being aware what constitutes a sociopath can help one resist their charm and the errors inherant in establishing a life with them.<br>  <br>  The key trait of sociopaths is that they don't feel. They may seem to laugh or cry but they present with no depth of emotion. While easily provoked to frustration or rage, their display of feeling is little more than a momentary, isolated temper tantrum. To the sociopath, other people are tools to get them what they want: money, sex, a job or other possessions. They live in their own amoral world where nothing they do has any consequences and where they owe no one anything. They have no empathy. Thus, they elude all responsibility for their actions, and can easily turn the tables, blaming their partner without guilt or shame.<br>  <br>  Sociopaths lie all the time. As they don't view their spouse as a thinking, feeling person, they do not see this behavior as wrong. Their only quest is to serve themselves and, if this entails lying, cheating or even murder, they will do so. If one catches them in lies, they are brilliant at changing the subject, placing the onus on the other person, denying their involvement or trying to make their spouse seem crazy. They are even good at deceiving the police and the court system; sociopaths rarely end up in prison for their actions.<br>  <br>  Sociopathic individuals rarely plan ahead. They undertake actions on the basis of momentary whims, often devious ones. Every act seems isolated in its own amoral universe. Thus, they cannot keep promises or repair the damage they've caused to others. When they lie, cheat or steal, the act exists solely for them; they believe it should have no repercussions or real world effects. They often appear to have "forgotten" they did something shortly after it happened. Their need for excitement encourages them to get involved in one night stands, shady deals and ill advised engagements.<br>  <br>  They have no sense of commitment to their spouses, any children they may have together or the future.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|euZRbiA2aa	Not suspected i know my friends are sociopath well psychopathic really.Yep friends all our lives.Good friends really.|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	Yes, I have.<br>  It was actually fairly quickly that I saw some major differences between myself and how I thought and felt about things and how she did. But, it's so foreign and alien to most (to feel no guilt and have no conscience) that it takes a while to believe it.<br>  No, I did not remain her friend.  She was a user, she knew it, and she didn't care.  A true sociopath does not truly understand the emotions and feelings that a non-sociopath goes through.  They have no problem with hurting people (physically, emotionally, whatever) to make their life be what they want.<br>  Sociopaths are also very good and mimicking true emotion.<br>  My advise is to absolutely not stay in a friendship or relationship with a sociopath.  And don't try to fix them.  They almost always don't want to be fixed and see normal guilt emotions as ridiculous and laughable.|`|tcSimSSaaa	Sorry, I thought this read "suspected BY a friend..."<br>  <br>  It's certainly possible, though.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	most people are sociopathic to one degree or another.<br>  <br>  personally, i wouldnt associate with someone who doesnt seem to care.  its pretty creepy.|`|AA10712251	Most of my freinds are sociopaths.

VrR9ojRRaa	It seems like it is all a physiological game to make themselves feel better with full disregard for your feelings.<br>  <br>  You have to always keep in the back of your mind that people are always looking out for themselves and generally are 100% selfish.<br>  <br>  It makes them feel like they have accomplished something when they stab you in the back.|`|WZVz5jWHaa	Sounds like you need a new set of friends.

AHJZeo8Oaa	There was a shift from emancipatory politics to identity politics.  Emancipatory politics is equal rights, right to vote and stand for election, right to equal pay, etc.  Identity politics is more concerned with the value given to different identities, and is part of the trend of New Social Movements, which have become more evident since the 70s  :-)|`|ZjCurM7saa	It went from crazy to crazier.|`|096b7gBHaa	from defending rights to seeking superiority and wonderland that never exists

872f4d28837b0b839ed695238bef2e97aa	yea, that's right, it's a clash of worlds, people who grew up in countries where children don't work believe children labor is evil.  The reality is that if their products don't sell, the companies close and the kids become criminals.<br>  <br>  What people don't realize is that nobody is forcing the kids to work there, they go to those companies to ask for a job.  Also people fail to realize that if those kids don't work they starve to death, their governments don't do anything to help them.  And the last thing people don't realize is that their wages are good, they only seem bad when you compare it to what people earn in Japan, Europe or the U.S.|`|lWqOTYvWaa	The people who oppose child labor in those cases would prefer the children go back to prostituting themselves in the streets. That way they can then they can travel to those countries on a "fact finding trip" and indulge in their perversions.<br>  <br>  At least that's the only thing that makes sense to me because you are right, for those kids, working in a factory is better than the alternative, which is why the get up everyday and go to the factory.

OncdpDunaa	It would greatly benefit you to get into the Social Work field as your first and primary major. But it takes more than just that. Psychology plays a factor in your mission. Substance Abuse Counseling will also help out, when it comes time to help a woman who is addicted to drugs so that she can hide the pain. Adolescent psychology helps, when dealing with the younger woman being abuse. The further you go down the line, Criminal Justice degrees with a concentration in Corrections can also give you a viewpoint you didn't know you needed.<br>  <br>  If at all possible, try to contact the Behavioral Sciences Department at Quantico, VA. You will more than likely learn the most important concepts there. Good luck. Hope I helped.

YT1vOwq6aa	Same here, but i will always love them. Even though their rules are strict i look at what it has done to my two older brothers and i am amazed. My eldest brother is in college, then my other older brother is currently trying out for the US NAVY SEALS. I plan to go to college. I look at some people whose parents are VERY lenient, they are the ones who tend to be drug dealers, and they hang with the wrong crowd.<br>  Listen to your parents, and follow what they say, the only time i disregard any of their rules or values is when i know it is wrong and it needs some changing, other than that, i try my best to respect them. After all they do feed, cloth, and provide shelter for me <br>  :-)|`|X4pFEbioaa	i hate my parents with a stong passion!!! they yell whenever they please they slap me (*in the face*) and sometimes hit my little shih tzu when they where angry they even beat her to death|`|jMxrNcXqaa	I think this is the symptoms of the puberty but sometimes not.<br>  Because moms sometimes seem to be all knowing. They know when something is wrong with you and ask you questions to find out what is going on. Alot of teens take this as an invasion of privacy; when it is actually just concern. Also moms have quirks and habits that just might get on any teens nerves. <br>  <br>  You want your independence and mom seems to be nothing but suffocating and into your business. You cant be cool if you like your mom, or at least not admit it in public. Alot of teens are really moody and want to be left alone. that is quite hard for a mom to do. In fact that in unnatural for a mother just to stand idly by and let her teen just do anything they want. <br>  <br>  their are many reasons that teens hate thier moms. <br>  <br>  These are just a few. Last but not least, Teens have hormones run amok and that makes them sometimes just impossible to be around. Hope that helps <br>  <br>  Some teens have difficulty coping with traumatic events such as divorce. The grief and depression can manifest itself as anger. Sometimes that anger is targeted towards the only person they know they won't lose no matter what they do........ mother or father. This teen is in great pain; hopefully both parents can recognize the situation and get their child help together. If only one parent is willing to act, let them remember that helping their child will be the best decision they have ever made.......and the hardest. Unfortunately, that parent will live with the pain of their child's hatred until therapy teaches the child how to cope.|`|EgA87yR0aa	You grow up basically (not totally, but in general) believing what your parents say.  When you are in your teens, you realize that other people also have legitimate views and you start to wonder if your parents are right or not.  If you start to feel your parents were wrong and you and your parents aren't good communicators, then you won't trust them either.  Then everything goes downhill for a while (or for a long time.)|`|8657735dad8b8e83d35f27855aa93949aa	Some of us have good reasons to loathe their parents. I would love strict parents. At least I would know they really care even if it doesn't seem like that. Mine don't care enough about me, in my opinion. <br>  <br>  If I had to guess how much I hated my parents, I'd say 70% of the time. They can be such pricks. Just yesterday, I caught my step-father loafing around when he needed to drive me to get a new pair of eyeglasses. I tried to hurry him up, then he started acting like a 10 year old. He complained I gave him "attitude", so he refused to drive me. I was pissed and confused. Did I do that? <br>  <br>  He drove me in the end, but it just shows how much they care(hardly at all). Whenever I ask my parents for money for something important, they take *forever* to give me the money. I'll admit our financial situation sucks, but how hard is it to come up with 12 bucks by Friday?! <br>  <br>  I feel like I'm less of a person in my home. As if they want to make my life miserable and try to tarnish my hopes and dreams. I feel limited. I dislike them because of that.  I can't wait until I'm 18, where I won't have anybody to overfeed me, or have to rely on somebody else to get me somewhere.|`|3b6face01da47e04ffc0e33e45f7bf70aa	We'll I think it's more anger, not hate.<br>  We're angry that after all the years of them acting like they can take care of everything and have things under control, we realize that they're humans, and they cant be perfefct.<br>  <br>  We realize all their faults and how they reflect on us, even if there are few and are all unintentional. It's just life. Eventually you realize that you grow to be somewhat like them and that it's not as easy as it seems to balance everything like marrige, work, family relations, frendships, life dreams, and THEN, on top of ALL that, raise a child into another person on the planet and try and do the best job of it to make them a good, accepting, understanding and responsible person. <br>  <br>  With children, we start to relize parents can be hypocrites.<br>   "clean your room." their room's a mess.<br>  "Dont stay up all night." They're up to 3am<br>  "Clean up after yourself." My father always leaves his dishes after lunch and never cleans up after dinner unless he cooks it. <br>  "Don't curse." I dare you to refrain from cursing everyother sentence dad/mom<br>  "Don't eat that crap, it'll make you sick." Oh please, like I'M the one with KitKats in my night table drawer.<br>  "Listen to your father/ mother." Like you do mom/ dad?<br>  "Be nice to your relatives." They're gossiping in the kitchen about Aunt Susy while Susy is sitting in the living room.<br>  <br>  I could go on for days. When it comes down to it though, its the subconcious way they deal with their own faults. They can't change, so they simply try and warn/ prevent us kids from winding up with those words falling out of our mouths when we're THEIR age. <br>  <br>  But it never works. <br>  <br>  Haha<br>  <br>  Understanding this isnt reason to ignore your anger and resentment. It doesnt make it anyless justified. I think it's human nature to notice faults in others and then try and avoid winding up with said faults in response, you know? And especially with parents because THEY are the ones ALWAYS telling you what to do what to say, how to act, to clean up. So yeh, its hard. I hate my mom for being the child in this relationship where  I'm 15 and more responsible than a 57 year old mother. But, who knows, maybe one day when I'm not in the same boiling pot as her I'll be able to appreciate the fact that I know about responsibility, especially when it comes to taking care of others. Maybe because my mom was kind of a bad mom, it'll make me a good mom some day. We'll see.

We may have to give up our leisurely activities, may not get to go to the gym, the kids might have to do without soccer and basketball for a while. Just keep reminding yourself that we can get through this.

kJqztlvCaa	That was good.  A few too many commas, but I, have, that, habit, too.<br>  <br>  he/she:  should be he or she.<br>  <br>  "just a psychologist":  that's a little demeaning, isn't it?   And are schizonphrenics more likely to be "referred" to someone, rather than choosing one?<br>  <br>  "team players":    "members of a team" would be better.  "Team players" implies something a little different to me -- someone who doesn't criticize, someone who follows the team goals and ideas even if they differ from her own.<br>  <br>  This sentence isn't clear:  "The two professions also work individually".     Because it isn't really the profession working, it's an individual who pratices that profession.  But I don't have a better suggestion.<br>  <br>  "intertwined as being the same"?  That's confusing.  Did you mean to say that people often mix them up?  Or that they often work together?<br>  <br>  "Psychiatrists procure an astounding" - procure isn't good here.  There's no harm in using "earn" in both parts of that sentence.<br>  <br>  "fifty percent of psychiatrists chose"  should be choose.<br>  <br>  "whilst" -- in America, at least, that should be "while".<br>  <br>  "These two accomplices of service, work together".   Accomplices isn't a good work here, and there's one of those extra commas.<br>  <br>  But that was really good.|`|r3QbyYSSaa	Very good essay.<br>  I especially like your phrase "accomplices of service".<br>  I made a few changes, not too many.<br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  While Psychologists and Psychiatrists share common roots and environments, and have comparable day to day duties, there are many profound differences between these two often confused professions.<br>  <br>  The ancient Greeks and Romans considered psychological problems to be supernatural. Hindu scriptures known as Ramayana and Mahabharata describe illnesses of the mind as arising from an imbalance of bodily fluids. The Chinese diagnosed the mentally afflicted with an imbalance of Ying and Yang. Each and every culture with the ability to display beliefs in a form of writing has reported their own perception of mental illness. It was only a matter of time before the study of the mind became scientific. Psychologists today believe that mental illness is caused by life stresses and maladaptive behavior patterns, whereas psychiatrists have concluded that the cause of a disturbed mind is biological in origin. They both seek to understand and treat the many unfortunate victims of mental disorders.<br>  <br>  To better understand the perception and treatment of each field of study, one must understand the education, philosophy and foundation of both professions. A psychologist usually requires either a PhD or Spy’s to practice independently. A psychiatrist on the other hand, must acquire a medical degree before pursuing an education in mental health. This is coupled with at least four years of residency; a minimum of three of those four years having to be in the mental health field. Possession of a medical degree allows a psychiatrist to administer a variety of medical tests, prescribe medication, and supervise electrotherapy treatments, whereas a psychologist cannot. Both professions do, however, follow the same law of ethics. They also provide similar services, such as educating students in understanding the mind, conducting research and providing psychotherapy sessions. Some common places to see both psychologists and psychiatrists are hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, schools, prisons, rehabilitation centers, military settings, and also private practices. They often work in a collaborative environment as team players to enhance diagnostic abilities and improve treatment strategies. <br>  <br>  The two professions also work individually. A psychologist mainly treats patients who are struggling with life issues. They may help someone adjust to life after being incarcerated, aid a family in the loss of a loved one, help children process the divorce of their parents, a veteran cope with the amputation of his limbs, or perhaps offer guidance to a confused adolescent. A psychiatrist can do all of these things, and can offer additional help due to the fact he/she is a physician. For example, patients suffering from schizophrenia may choose the aid of a psychiatrist rather than a psychologist. This would be beneficial in order to receive medication and therapy from a single source to suppress the voices and delusions in their mind. The objective for both professions is to aid in the quality of life of any given individual, although their approaches to treatment may differ. <br>  <br>  It is easy to see why these two valued occupations are commonly misconstrued as being the same, but there are a number of other differences between the two. For instance, psychologists and psychiatrists earn substantially different amounts of money. Psychiatrists procure an astounding average salary of $180,000.00 annually, while a psychologist doesn’t earn half as much, on average a mere $60,000.00 per year, comparatively.  Another notable difference is that fifty percent of psychiatrists choose to maintain private practices, while psychologists are more likely to work within an organization.<br>  <br>  Many years of sweat and tears have gone into the experimentation and research needed to further the understanding of the human mind. These two accomplices of service have worked together and individually, to aid members of our society through times of catastrophe and hardship, and will continue to do so. They are educated extensively and share a common goal of helping those in need. They make significant changes in the lives of the unfortunate, who need the aid of these two professions so desperately. In order to care for all patients fully, both types of these Samaritans are needed for their individual perceptions and treatments

0Kvb1076aa	hmm that's an interesting thought..I think everyone is different and unique and everyone is weird because we are all different and have different thoughts and opinions on things.We're all weird because we all say or think or like things that other people may think are weird and vice versa..so everyone is mixed with a little weird and a little norm, that's what makes everyone different|`|knvXQDvzaa	everyone is weird. society may make one way seem normal, but everyone is weird. <br>  some have freak flags but just don't fly them.|`|yPsbcrkkaa	It is quite "normal" to want to be different.....we all strive to hold onto our own individuality. Sadly many of us strive our whole lives without ever achieving or really experiencing what it is like to really be "oneself." In order to survive we frequently grasp the "winning valence" (personality) and attempt to be that valence in an effort to be the survivor. But in actuality you are an immortal being and therefore do not need any of these superficial "valences" to survive....you survive best as yourself.<br>  When you truly are being yourself; this is your highest pinnacle of individuality. Being able to achieve "self" minus all added fa?ades is the greatest challenge.|`|OncdpDunaa	I don't know. I asked the doctor one time why I couldn't be normal like everyone else. She asked me, what is normal? I guess if the doctor doesn't know then I don't know either. If norm is boring and it means I have to become a conformists, then I don't want anything to do with being norm or following the norm. God Bless|`|Tryf71mtaa	good question :). people make fun of people for being different or weird, but since we're all different, in my view, we are all weird. Even people who wear the same hollister and aero clothes are different, even if they fit in with the group.|`|844Gkwnfaa	i like your question makes a person think... got me thinking ...hmm weird is normal
mVTGl6HGaa	Haskalah (Hebrew: ??????; "enlightenment," "education" from sekhel "intellect", "mind"), the Jewish Enlightenment, was a movement among European Jews in the late 18th century that advocated adopting enlightenment values, pressing for better integration into European society, and increasing education in secular studies, Hebrew, and Jewish history. Haskalah in this sense marked the beginning of the wider engagement of European Jews with the secular world, ultimately resulting in the first Jewish political movements and the struggle for Jewish emancipation. The division of Ashkenazi Jewry into religious movements or denominations, especially in North America and anglophone countries, began historically as a reaction to Haskalah.<br>  <br>  In a more restricted sense, haskalah can also denote the study of Biblical Hebrew and of the poetical, scientific, and critical parts of Hebrew literature. The term is sometimes used to describe modern critical study of Jewish religious books, such as the Mishnah and Talmud, when used to differentiate these modern modes of study from the methods used by Orthodox Jews.
2vBYTCUDaa	Dreams happen when you are trying to sort out a problem. Maybe you are indifferent about being sober and your mind is trying to figure it out at night and how to deal without alcohol. Dreams will continue for me all the  time, its not completely weird.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	I think you're right, its all that toxic garbage leaving your system. Stick with it and good luck!

U69Q6rsWaa	A suppressor variable (if we're thinking of the same thing) is typically referenced in regards to regression. <br>  <br>  Say you have your dependent variable that you're trying to predict (y) and you have two measures to predict it from (x1 and x2). X2 will be the suppressor in this case.<br>  <br>  X1 has a reasonable positive correlation with Y, and X2 has little or no correlation with Y, yet when you include X2 in the regression model, the fit of the model improves and the coefficient for X1 becomes higher (this might seem a little odd on the surface, as you wouldn't expect your model to explain more by adding a variable that isn't related to the thing your predicting). The idea is that, when it isn't included, X2 *suppresses* the relationship between X1 and Y, because X1 and X2 are related in some way. <br>  <br>  As a (probably not very good) example off of the top of my head, say you're predicting driving ability by measures of visual-spatial IQ and verbal IQ. Independently, your visual IQ has a small positive relationship with driving ability (you would expect it to be large), whereas the verbal IQ measure has no correlation. When you include both as predictors, the coefficient for visual IQ is a lot higher, and the R2 figures etc. say your model explains a lot more of the variation. This is because, whereas verbal IQ doesn't relate to driving (it doesn't require verbal ability), verbal IQ is related to visual IQ (through general intelligence) and may influence how well they can perform on tests (those with a poor verbal IQ may not understand the question for example). Adding the suppressor to the model helps to explain more of the variation in the scores.<br>  <br>  They can be tricky to identify, its usually a case of looking at the relationship between your dependent variable and predictors one at a time, and comparing how fit improves both individually and when you enter them all. If one variable has a small effect, but vastly improves the model fit and weight of the other coefficients, its worth considering. You also might want to consider it if you get an unexpectedly small relationship for something you should be getting a strong effect for. <br>  <br>  Its important to consider them because you may be under appreciating a relationship if you don't include it (type 2 error, you say there is no effect when there actually is, its just 'disguised' by another variable).<br>  <br>  (sorry for the long answer)|`|WZVz5jWHaa	It would be so helpful if you actually described what you are asking about first.|`|QFG0yu24aa	if you find that x and y are positively correlated using pearson's but then reverse their correlation in multiple regression then one of the variable in your model is a suppressor. identify it by removing the other variables one by one until the direction of correlation normalises again. <br>  <br>  no need to remove a suppressor - it is not doing any harm (except causing confusion), and will increase your r square value.

MJijF66Paa	Three things must happen before the economy can recover.<br>  <br>  The first is pretty standard and most important: the the national debt must be liquidated and MAL investments have to be offset. Every country that has ever ran this type of reckless expansionary monetary policy with a fiat currency, or a currency with no intrinsic value, has had recessions. The US has even upped the odds with its GDP largely based on consumer spending (US GDP = 70% consumer spending) and an increasing trade deficit to accompany it; our economic footing is accumulating debt from bought imported products. An economy must be able to produce wealth to be solvent.<br>  <br>  Given this, recessions are necessary because, in all the circumstances, debt has to be liquidated and to also offset all MAL investments.<br>  <br>  The second and third are centered around the first but will be good indications to the end of the downturn. That is interest funding rates set by the Federal Reserve must dramatically increase to entail inflation and the Bond Bubble must pop. <br>  <br>  Even after these factors find equilibrium though, the US economy won't automatically go back to its original form. The reason we're in this mess in the first place is because we've been living beyond our means, hence the debt and excess.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Nope, we're heading to zero.<br>  <br>  ...if you consider the dow hitting 5K to be close enough to zero.|`|uyXfPDzDaa	The only way the economy is going to heal is if people start spending money.<br>  The economy is bad because of a couple reasons:<br>  1)the stocks went high, then people started to sell their stocks, well when way too many people start selling at the same time, the share price goes down and eventually the stock market plumets,<br>  2)people get scared and stop spending their money, they save it all for the future, because who knows what will happen in the future<br>  3)people go broke, foreclosure what not because if they sell their stocks and cant pay of the intrest, the bank takes their collateral ie. house<br>  therefore, people stop spending, stores lose money, stores close, economy goes in the toilet<br>  people need to spend to get the economy going again or else we are going to see a depression which is hell on earth, go look up the great depression, as far as i can see, were heading for that<br>  america is also in debt<br>  they are spending money that they dont even have, <br>  they owe money to other countries and themselves,<br>  that being said, if they cant pay it off, which most likely they wont, be prepared for a depression, right now we are in a recession which is the level above depression|`|872f4d28837b0b839ed695238bef2e97aa	My personal opinion, the economy needs to crash completely so that a new, better economy can be born out of the minds of our young entrepreneurs.  If the government manages to pull the economy out of recession they will just postpone the crash 5 or 10 years.<br>  <br>  The other big question is how healed will it be?  i don't think it will ever be as good as it was in the 90s again.<br>  <br>  For the short term it will keep going down.|`|fEEbx6XTaa	Eventually, but most likely not soon.|`|9b8LkVr0aa	yes it did the same things in the 70s and 80s|`|7FFfQ7hwaa	It's pretty much impossible for something to stay the same way forever.

Who knows how long it'll take this time, but it will. Nothing ever stays the same - and that goes for bad stuff too.|`|F4ujCPGiaa	The answer to this question is very difficult to predict, but things get worse before they get better,so its bad now,am I right?

ChZ1C4gXaa	because your subconscious is influenced by a superior figure or force and therefor follows commands of said influence and will do whatever. however you won't do anything that you can't physically or mentally do already unless you were once able to but that gets into the uses for hypnosis. and the reason why you don't remember anything was because you were never really there, that is to say that your conscious mind wasn't do to the fact that it was under the subconscious's persuasion.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  You can do all the things which you do, a hypnotic state for some issues simply gives you permission where it is hid from in normal conscious states. <br>  <br>  You can forget things do to the subconscious mind allowing certain things to be forgotten.<br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	it's because it affects a different state of your brain. like an awake sub con or something. parts of your brain that you don't usually use when completely conscious.|`|O8TAab3yaa	When you are under hypnosis, your conscious mind is basically in the background while your subconscious is up front and center. It is your subsonscious that holds most information. That is why you can remember a license plate or address under hypnosis and you can't consciously. I'm a certified hypnotherapist.|`|o8olgtgSaa	i guess its because no conscious thought goes into the action, you arn't aware of your limits so your not held back by them. and maybe for the forgetting things part your brain just represses what its carefully instructed to... i don't know!<br>  <br>  i'm no expert, but it is interesting.... hmmm|`|uxe4Hroxaa	Because you are in a subconscious state

aPxmZq00aa	They rationalize to themselves for not helping support their kids, telling themselves they can't afford to pay the support, that the mother would just keep demanding more, that the mother is turning the kids against them anyway, and on and on and on, a million excuses. Then after a few years they probably feel like they have made such a mess of things that they think their kids probably hate them so they still stay away. It takes a real man to come back from being a deadbeat dad and face the responsibilities.Then they are expected to answer a lot of questions they probably don't have any good answers to.  So they just stay away.Sad, sad, sad for all involved.|`|3hu7tgS8aa	There is two sides to every issue!<br>  Society is quick to condemn.   We live in a matriarchal society, and since we exalt the female, she is without blame in any situation that ends up with a marriage breaking up.   The man is "branded" "deadbeat" and is condemned, in most cases unjustly.   The average man classified in this manner, had to make a choice in life.   Life has never been easy, and to be saddled with a order by a court to pay support for a child he never allowed to see, is a lot to expect from him.    Situations are compounded when the mother goes out of her way to seek revenge, and to make problems worse.    <br>  Yes, the child does suffer, but they learn to cope with the situations.   <br>  A measure of a mans worth is not what society demands from him, but what he demands from himself
f9sL3WgQaa	I tend to absorb the emotional pain they must of felt from what and when they received them. I find it sad to see anyone who has been hurt.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	i think that it shows that they're human. everyone can get scars. also, that they've been through something and survived! like that person is a really tough cookie. :D<br>  <br>  i personally have a few scars of my own and my bf doesn't mind at all. <3|`|NSKimt1Qaa	I think that for me, it totally depends on the person.  If I already find a person attractive and sexy, then that might just add to it, because it's part of them and their life story.  If some weird guy on the street who looks like a serial killer has a scar, it would definitely not improve his looks.<br>  The scars I have are hardly noticeable but are meaningful to me.  I never thought of them as sexy. = )|`|XK6k2UAIaa	Yeah in a way. It's weird. Especially if they have a tan skin color. It brings out the scar's more. I guess just the since of danger and or excitement.|`|RvmYqQtRaa	I have tons of awesome ones but since you're not a lady I won't describe them.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Yeah something about a slash across a mans chest just makes me........!|`|wXaGIPSPaa	A study in U.K. suggests that women find men with facial scars more attractive than their unmarred counterparts. Researchers from the universities of Liverpool and Stirling say that "under certain circumstances post-traumatic scarring may increase a person's perceived social worth." The conclusion is based on the results of 220 people asked to evaluate pictures of men and women, some of which had been manipulated to have different scars. Men's opinions of women were unaffected by scarring. Exactly why women favour scars is not clear, but one theory is that scarring provides visible evidence of past trauma and may suggest the man is a risk-taker.A fighter...a protector, a manly man.  I have a small chicken pox scar......does that count?|`|KJA6sIEDaa	I wouldn't like if he was all scratched like from a bar fight but the right amount is sexy.

TyTFTIJOaa	Well, there's a part of you that likes him, so try to become his friend. ^^ friendly relationships are harmless, and their always a good way to get to know someone and see if you actually want to know them better. Start out by just saying hi in the hallway or something like that, or smile when you catch him looking at you. If you really want to get rid of the emotion that bad... like, you don't want to even try this out, then just ignore him. Guys don't chase around forever.|`|89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	There is something you like about him. Be friends, you do want to know him, you're just trying to convince yourself that you don't want to be friends with him and that you don't like him. Go talk to him because he didn't hear you the first time which made you feel embarrassed. You think he's cute, quirky, or fun and you want to get to know him but you're too young to realize what you want. TALK TO HIM.|`|QpCsS68Zaa	Sounds like rather than getting rid of an emotion you should focus on building your confidence. <br>  <br>  Tallk to the kid. You might get along.|`|kt2i6eKXaa	you can't. you like him so go w/ it and see where it goes.|`|k2wPknXlaa	Smile at him and let him do the talking|`|Vmp1KK1iaa	At 15 that emotion is going to show up. I'm afraid that there is no getting rid of it. Don't curse, don't throw a shoe, just enjoy it even though you hate it. You don't have to react to it. Unless it is ruining your school life, like grades, just wait it out. It will go away by it's self it my take a year, but it will go away, unless it's love. My advice is don't avoid but don't go near him. Let him come to you and don't come off cold. Boys like a challenge.|`|7p1Amhofaa	you seem to be infatuated by him... well, instead of throwing away a perfectly good shoe, you can always just be friends with him, play it cool, and see where it goes... you shy? well, then get his email from a friend, and ask him some school related questions (school related stuff always works- you get a chance to warm up to him up, but you won't come off too strong, and plus, you'll have something to focus on, so the likelihood of stammering is low...)|`|3C06kNGuaa	It sounds like you really like this guy!  Why do you want to get rid of that emotion?  It's great to like someone, really!  You should give it a chance.  Unless there is more reason.  <br>  <br>  Also I like the way you wrote that, it's kind of like a poem! :-)|`|rRIiY6Itaa	He likes you to apparently from what I think you said that is possible from knowing.<br>  <br>  You should go for it. I think he knows you like him so he is just being friendly I guess encase you want to talk to him. I wouldnt smile at a girl for no reason.<br>  <br>  Smile back or talk back to him.|`|hYKsD1G6aa	Sounds like you might have a crush on him.  Just go with the flow and see what happens.  It's a good thing to like someone.  take care|`|aPxmZq00aa	You're afraid of rejection, its normal and you will experience it throughout your life. Take a chance and talk to him, it may work out. The more positive experiences you have in life, the less you fear rejection because you will build your confidence knowing some things will work out the way you want and some won't but if they don't, then something else good is always just around the corner. Hope this helped you.

k2wPknXlaa	When someone is in love with someone who can't commit to loving them back, it is very difficult to break it off. It is very hard to give the hope of that love up. It feels very much like bashing your head against a wall. If you continue to bash your head against a wall you will feel worse and worse. Eventually the pain becomes too much to bear and you realize that the only way to survive is to cut yourself off from the pain. In that case, the pain off cutting him off, becomes less than the pain that you bear each day thinking about the things that he is doing that cause you pain..
QEOx27CUaa	my interpretation would be that your angels are trying to let you know to focus on your spiritual being,and work on that,third neye is spiritual..luck...|`|Ruifi0GSaa	Hi,<br>  When you dream of eyes means: Open your eyes and take a closer look at your situation. Your perception or point of view.<br>  And Focus your attention. Look closer.<br>  Hope that helps, good dreaming :)|`|Gfu1Nm0Gaa	My interpretation is that you feel part of your life is out of control. The eye rolling represents the part of your life you cannot control.  You want to bring it back into focus but you cannot - but all is not bad because your other eye is stable.   The first dream was probably pretty much the same thing - the third eye was something new and strange happening in your life and you couldn't see it with your eyes, but your subconcious was picking up on it.
XR78voyOaa	Maybe the reason you could be tired is that you might be stressed about something. Even though you get good amount of hours when you sleep, during the day stress causes you to be tired. Stress sucks the energy out of you, and it may even prevent you from sleeping. <br>  <br>  But pulling all nighters 2 days a week is not a good thing. You should get some sleep every night.|`|k2wPknXlaa	A good place to start would be to talk to your doctor. Sometimes there's a medical reason for being tired.

T3b4I4kXaa	Ahem!  Having been in the human potential movement for over 20 years, I can tell you that there are ways of developing your intuition. Most of it involves practicing meditation and learning to get out of your own way and allowing yourself to feel things out.<br>  <br>  Women tend to become intuitionally developed earlier because our spiritual path tends to begin at age 30 or so. Women have more different things to look after and they are all interconnected. <br>  <br>  You'd be surprised at how my mom was able to tune in and cut to the chase of a situation, even having woken out of a dead sleep to do so, while the rest of the household was pacing the floors.|`|XwqePXrOaa	No.<br>  <br>  The idea that women have special psychic powers is a popular one, probably borne of the idea of women as foreign and mysterious (black cats, according to the same sources, are also supposed to be magical), and enduring because it's flattering to the people it stereotypes.<br>  <br>  A vagina doesn't make you psychic any more than a crystal ball or animal spleen does.<br>  <br>  We've come far enough in our civilization not to believe in magic anymore, haven't we?|`|xCd7m5dkaa	No its just some bogus crap they came up with to scare the men and keep them on their toes.|`|uLHtXibRaa	YES!!!...certainly were a mother is concerned..really tho...its more like knowing someone so well..being so mentally connected you can literally sense that something is not right...and women the more sensitive of genders...with that nurturing instinct...usually are the ones to 'feel'..thru perception of a persons way of acting that theres a very distinct difference in their life.. men have this too..but usually its coz they are feeling gulity coz they know they have put their foot in it but pretend like they dont know..lol..|`|AKvLiwB6aa	DEFNITLY!!!!   ive always had a real strong womens intuiton...  an i lernt to ALWAYS trust mine...  my intuiton warns me when ppl r lying...  an it warns me not to trust bad ppl...  i always end up regreting it when i dont lisen to my feelings telling me somthings not rite...  i beleve my womens intuiton is realy my gardian angle looking out for me an warning me when trubles near...|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	I don't know, its arrogant to assume that we know everything and the possibility of some type of psychic bond is impossible. I prefer to think we know very little and the universe is still an unread book.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	yes we have it some stronger then others <br>  when i'm with someone and he messes up I normally know before he says anything<br>  and i always know when my boy is in trouble|`|1vaqtRI2aa	Simply: Yes. Especially a "mothers intuition". A lot of mothers have a strong sense about their child. It's pretty weird, but true. My mother seems to always know what I'm up to, simply through intuition.<br>  <br>  MOST (not every) women have better intuition than men, whether either gender will admit it or not. I'm not saying men don't have it, but women are known to be more in touch with their feelings and such.<br>  <br>  And men can't truely answer this question, because how would they know if a WOMAN has WOMENS intuition or not?<br>  <br>  Interesting question, I starred it.|`|rpRqRwg2aa	As with karma there is no such thing. Like one of the posters said, it's just to scare men into doing something they want
fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	I don't believe in substitutes altogether as that will lead to another substitute later.<br>  <br>  I would rather make determination of that I want to keep it off for shorter intervals and slowly lengthen it from time to time. This will make yourself more disciplined and altogether make you ready for stronger tasks in life.<br>  I feel taking chocolate is not a big crime anyway as long you keep to your limits or ask someone close to help you to control its intake like by asking them to stop you when you go aboard your limits.<br>  <br>  Good Luck dear.|`|RvmYqQtRaa	Get lost.

Kissing often means communicating. Sometimes signifies an initiation or a betrayal.<br>  Take a look at the things you say, have said or need to say.<br>  The neck of another, signifies your worldly mindedness will cause broken domestic ties.<br>  House means: You, your state of mind, the dwelling place of your soul. The state of the house reflects your state of mind.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, and good dreams to you|`|8c4b3eb4750ebdad6b8f1012977f2f9baa	You might have a physical or chemical connection, but that doesn't mean you are the ones for each other.

2eztcCO0aa	I work at home too, and here's what I do.  I have a program on my computer called Big Ben Chimes.  I have it set to chime at 15 minutes before every hour and again on the hour.  It first goes off when I need to sit down to work.  I start working, and then 45 minutes later, I hear the chimes and get up to do some work around the house.  Then it chimes, and I stop what I'm doing (even in the middle of a task) and go back to work.  I do this all day, and by the time the day is over, I've gotten all my work done, and all my housework too.<br>  <br>  If you have errands outside of the house, do them at lunchtime, just like you would do if you were in the office that day.  Or do them at the end of the day.  If you do them at any other time, it will eat into your schedule, and you'll have wasted too much time.<br>  <br>  You have to be willing to work during work time and leave it to get up and do the housework.  You have to be willing to stop the housework in the middle and go back to work on time.  Sometimes that means that you only get half the clothes folded or that you get the floor swept but not mopped this hour.  But you'll be surprised how much work you can get done in 15-minute increments.|`|IGAx1FgEaa	get some of ur stuff ready at night|`|TyTFTIJOaa	Well, what you could try the first few days is right a note or tie a ribbon to your finger to remind yourself that you want to be more efficient. Then while you're doing the morning chores, think that you want it done faster, so you'll try to cut out the less important stuff. This will probably become habbit and problem solved, but another way that might help is having your husband or a friend help you out with you're schedule. Put things in their place before you go to bed every night so that when you wake up you'll have less to do. I used to have a little bit of trouble getting organized every morning so that's what i did ^^ Good Luck!|`|7p1Amhofaa	you might consider sleeping earlier, hence you would have more hours of sleep, but you can wake up earlier. However, its highly likely you're sleeping in different times of the night (ie. 12 on tuesday, 10 on wednesday, 2 on thursday- (now that would be freaky if the times were spot on :S), your biological clock is a mess, so the best thing to do is stick to the same "sleeping time" and "waking up time"... after a while, you'll get used to it, and you'll automatically feel tired when sleepy time approaches, and you'll wake up automatically at around the same wake up time too...|`|k2wPknXlaa	You might try putting together some lists organized by day. So that on certain days you do certain things. Some things you may do every day. Some things not. When you get up you just have to follow the list for that day. You can add or delete from the lists as you go to make them work better for you. THe lists build routine into your days so that you don't have to worry about forgetting what you need to do to keep your life together|`|QpCsS68Zaa	Short and sweet - do it before you go to bed.
qs9QHvy9aa	Counseling for your past abuse would be a good thing.  Short of that, your thoughts are normal, a lot of people have this fantasy.  I will give you two tips for carrying out your fantasy with a "TRUSTED" partner.  1.  Do not ever include choking in your play, its not safe.  The human neck as more going through it than just air.  Block one spot, and its only air your blocking, and you can live for a few minutes like that, but, block the wrong spot and you could stop the blood flow, and by doing that, you can die in less than a minute (unconsciousness can kick in as fast as 10 seconds, I learned how to do it purposely in martial arts).  2.  Have a safe word EVERY time.  Something that wouldn't be said in normal talk.  I personally use the word "mayday".  If the play becomes too rough, or too much to mentally deal with, either partner can say the word, and play stops instantly, no hard feelings, no questions asked, and take a break.  Having a safe word is important for this type of play to keep everyone safe.  Have fun!|`|rsAqrbsgaa	It's okay, i have those too<br>  It's normal|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	fantasies are healthy. everyone has them. it's when you cross that line that it becomes a problem.|`|LtZ064eoaa	not trying to be funny but maybe you just want to be roughed up sexually? idk but i think you and me have the same thoughts and it's just a fantasy but if you feel that unsure about it just go and see someone like a Professional|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Look for a therapist near you.|`|hTieELhTaa	call dr drew on the love line. or go seek profesinal help|`|89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	The human mind is very complex, but you're going to have to get in touch with a psychologist. I'm majoring in Psychology so I'll tell you what I think. Because you were molested while you were developing through your childhood and through your teen years, you may not like what I say next, you like the sexual feelings of being used, and feeling helpless to do anything. Being sexually used arouses you, or the thought of being, gives you this sensation. Though you don't WANT to get raped you want the act of sex to imitate a rape scene. You want someone to physically dominate you while forcing themselves upon you. It's just a fantasy, what I recommend is that (if you are with someone right now) to ask them to force him/her on you and see if you like it. It may not be normal to other people but like I said, the human mind is very complex.|`|3C06kNGuaa	I agree with the guy who said counseling.  I would suggest going to a woman's center of some sort (the kind that deals with domestic abuse/violence) as they usually know how to deal with things involving that best (I'm assuming it was a relative that molested you... if not I'm not sure how they'd deal).  My only experience with rape/molestation is from watching "Law and Order: SVU", so I'm afraid that's the best advice I can give.  Although I can say my dad was verbally/emotionally abusive to my sisters, mom, and me, and that's how I found out about going to a women's center for counseling.  They are really good with issues stemming from family problems.  Good luck and I hope things get better for you. :)|`|74xzCuqfaa	With your history, I highly recommend counseling. If you didn't have that history, it may just be a normal deviation from center. The history makes the difference, in your case. Even if you didn't have that fantasy, counseling is still highly recommended.|`|I5jMTGUlaa	I have them too, where im been treated badly and his taking control, i love them !!<br>  If you have a boyfriend maybe you should have a bit of role play and let him take on the role of being the rapist.<br>  (Its just a thought)|`|KJA6sIEDaa	Sexual fantasies are normal.

During that year, you'll be attending class, seeing clients, receiving and providing supervision (to the master's level folks), applying for internship, working on your dissertation proposal, and quite possibly teaching an undergraduate course for the department. <br>  <br>  Don't count on getting much sleep if you're entering a doctoral program.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	it's what you make of it. it's up to you to decide how many clients you want to talk to in a day.
BehIVocqaa	This dream was so real and so vivid.  I was lying on the ground watching the sky.  Before me, the sun eclipsed and the sky filled with the most incredible images I had ever seen.  I could see the planets of our solar system lining up in a row across the sky.  As each passed through the middle field of my vision, each planet became larger. The hues were beyond description, so rich and intense, the colors were alive.  In the dream, it took my breath away.  I thanked God for the experience because I knew that only He could have provided such a spectacular display.  I never wanted it to end!|`|3C06kNGuaa	Well I almost never have lucid dreams, but it just so happens one of the best dreams I've ever had (lucid or otherwise) is also one of two lucids I've ever had.  It was that I could fly!  It was so amazing just zooming around wherever I wanted to go.  The feeling of weightlessness was AWESOME!  I hope I have one again soon, it's been a while. :)<br>  <br>  My only other lucid dream was when I was getting shot in the lung.  I was like "wake up wake up it's a dream!" but I didn't wake up and I forgot it was a dream.  So the shooting sucked lol.  Besides that though I have lots of dreams, just never lucid.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	I was being chased by a monster and I was on the 23rd story of an apartment building I ran to the window at the end of the wall and had to decide to jump or let the monster get me, so I jumped.

It was very tactile!|`|qLvhoRpsaa	It took place a few years ago. I was going through another devastating time. I couldn't sleep and was lost. Friends and family could not reach me. It was a dark time in my life, one of many, but this one was up there. <br>  <br>  My mom had died in 1997 and me and my daughters were living with her after a nasty separation from their father. I had been really wishing she was alive as she would have known how to help me. She always could. <br>  <br>  So, in my lucid dream, I was in the backyard of our family home. We had some acreage and horses, rabbitts, cats, dogs, and even a seagull. In this dream, I was back in 1975, aged 10, although I had all of the knowledge and memories of my real self, aged 41. <br>  <br>  I was smelling the grass (over grown), looking at the wild ***** willows and admiring the Lilac bushes, in full bloom. I realized that I was in dreaming. I was able to "ask" my dream for comfort. I then knew someone was looking at me, from behind me. As I turned, there was my mother. She looked like she was maybe in her 40's (she died at the age of 72) and her hair was long and dark (like it was in real life at that period in her life) and she didn't say a word. I ran to her, but stopped short of throwing my arms around her. I realized that I felt a bit scared and had no idea if it was real or memorex. She then "told me" it was in my head, she didn't move her lips) and she said, "It is okay Joanne. I love you. I am happy. You will be too." <br>  <br>  I then hugged her like we did in real life. We crushed each other with that hug. Damn it felt good. <br>  <br>  And then, she let go, smiled (and there was white all around her), then turned, and started walking away down our gravel driveway. <br>  <br>  I woke up with tears streaming down my face! Not sad tears, the happiest tears I had cried since before she had died. I "knew" that it was her, and it was real. <br>  <br>  It changed my life actually. I did some pretty big changes in my life in the next 30 days following that lucid dream. <br>  <br>  And she was right. I was okay. I did get happier. And she did love me. <br>  <br>  Peace:)|`|AA10199093	When I was a boy, I dreamed I stood before Satan.  He was sitting on an ebony thrown. He beheaded me and my corpse burned before him. I had trouble sleeping for many days after that.  <br>  <br>  It's only my favorite because 30 years or so later, when I think of it, it comes back so very clearly.|`|TyTFTIJOaa	I've only lucid dreamt like five times, but anytime I can make myself fly.... I love that. ^^ Like one, I was in a castle, and there was a war going on, and people were shooting at me with arrows, and i tried to jump to the safe side. On the way I realized I was dreaming, then extended the jump and was eventually flying. It was really awesome, and I'm trying to train myself how to be able to do that anytime I want (so long I'm asleep). It's possible even if you're not born with the talent. What's your favorite experience?|`|o0yUd22Laa	I was taking a shower and I was both me taking the shower and somebody watching from above.

RsjPhDoMaa	Wow.. I feel so sorry for you.. omg I don't want to have kids.. Look I would suggest sending him to the school psychiatrist/counselor and talk to his teachers, ask whether he spends time with someone/someones. If he is bullied then maybe it's better to do something drastic, like changing school. I don't know how old he is but often people change when they have to take responsibility. Make him take a job over the summer, get him out of the house as much as possible and (though I don't think he'll cooperate) try to shop new clothes for him, give him a new haircut. If you don't do some really drastic things he might end up as a very unsocial person, cooped up in a small apartment, taking drugs and such.. I'm still taking studies in psychology so I'm not an expert yet.. sort of anyway. But YOU will have to do something because he ain't.<br>  <br>  Do something social or social-like that he likes with him.. If he likes music (who doesn't) try taking him to a concert or something. The cinema, malls, biking, taking care of the dishes, cutting the lawn if that's an option for you, delivering the newspaper anything like that should help. If you try all that and it wouldn't work then he needs professional help, sorry.. Since I have never met the kid I would suggest that you take help from a family therapist. Take advise or if you don't feel up to it just send him to that therapist.<br>  <br>  I have unofficially help people I know with their kids.. though that was before things got severe.. That was when you could see warning signs that indicated that things might turn out a certain way. Remember that the longer you wait the longer and harder it will be to change him. Good luck.
m5eHZvPfaa	Parents have to teach their children to be strong individuals, even if that means walking alone. <br>  <br>  I had to deal with this growing up, and I chose to be the best that I could be and I didn't worry about how others could relate to me, it was their loss as far as I cared.<br>  <br>  Parents must teach their children a fact, that to be who you are will eventually attract those who are just fine with who you are, as they may be of like mind! <br>  <br>  I found those people, and they found me. There were also times when yes I was alone, and I didn't always like it, but I found it more disturbing to dare try to bend into what level of idiot behavior I needed to adopt in order for someone to be cool with me.<br>  <br>  In terms of whats acting white, acting black...I let people think what they may.<br>  <br>  Parents, teach your children individuality!

4A7qmvWtaa	Empathy is what you are feeling.  Empathy is being able to identify with another person's feelings or situation.  Why? Most of us are just wired that way-and it is a good thing even though it makes you sad at times.  Having empathy allows you to put yourself in another person's shoes and better relate to their situation.  This is a tremendous asset for your social skills.  Don't worry, it's a good thing.|`|Gfu1Nm0Gaa	Empathy - your are a good person.  This young man needs a friend - he's sad and probably a little depressed.

A large battle scene and the funerals.  At such a<br>  large battle scene there could be much confusion over who<br>  actually died.<br>  And the possibility exists that your subconscious mind is telling<br>  you that the reason you are sickly now, is so you will not try to be a warrior again in this life, because you have other lessons to work on now.<br>  I can't say for sure what it means, but wanted to point out some themes..|`|dc04cc16355f7402c67d1515087137a0aa	People often dream about death because of stress from daily activies like school or work, wanting to die or having witnessing death.<br>  It normal.

I think he sees it as a booty call, and the reason why hes not doin the same to the girls in his group is because hes is about his popularity around the people he hangs with.

Im sure you can do a lot better then from what he sounds like.|`|QKnY5Hw9aa	Well let me tell you girl, if he calls at three in the morning, he's not calling to hang out.  If he ignores you in public and calls you at #am when his night is over he wants to get in your pants and that's it.  If he liked you he'd want to hang out BEFORE  3 am, and he'd want to have a conversation with you in public or private.  He's playing games.

They started out small but they had the motivation and achieved it. What I would do is get someone that inspires you and look up to that person. Get a huge poster and tape it right on the wall where your pc's at. Then whenever you go to your computer, you see that huge poster and get to work!|`|OlS4uijKaa	Dreams are fun, but you have to make those a reality by breaking them down into a series of little goals.  As you start achieving those goals you will become more motivated. Join some sort of academic group where you will have people to encourage you on your path.  Set a limit for yourself on the computer.  And make plans to meet up with people or do something specific right after the computer time, so you will have to get off the computer in order to carry out your plans.  We all feel lazy and have periods where we just want to let our brains go blank, but if there are things that you really want to do, don't let anything stop you.  I truly hope you achieve your dreams!|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	you gotta' focus on what you're doing! if you really care about achieving those goals then you will force yourself to work harder than you ever have before. set out a schedule of tasks and stick to them. follow your list of stuff and don't start on one thing until the other is completely done!|`|RkBlMyHRaa	Go for a run to clear you head, and if the PC is making you lose your life get rid of it until you are done with your studies.
mVTGl6HGaa	In painting the style called Neo-Realism was established by the ex-Camden Town Group painters Charles Ginner and Harold Gilman at the beginning of World War I. They set out to explore the spirit of their age through the shapes and colours of daily life.[1]<br>  <br>  Their intentions were proclaimed in Ginner’s manifesto in New Age (1 Jan 1914), which was also used as the preface to Gilman and Ginner’s two-man exhibition of that year. It attacked the academic and warned against the ‘decorative’ aspect of imitators of Post-Impressionism. [1]<br>  <br>  The best examples of Neo-Realist work is that produced by these two artists and also by Robert Bevan, whose short-lived Cumberland Market Group they joined in 1914.

Mary Magdalen was the leader of a group of women who supported Jesus in his ministry.  The gospel of Saint Luke tells us that she had been healed of a serious disease (seven demons).

She was a Jewish woman of Nazareth in Galilee. She was engaged to Joseph when she became pregnant with Jesus. According to the story, she was a virgin at Jesus' conception because she was impregnated by God. <br>  <br>  There was Mary Magdalene, who was a follower of Jesus and some believe was a prostitute.<br>  <br>  There was Mary, sister to Martha and Lazarus. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.|`|kzIUFzYTaa	Mary is the mother of Jesus. She's a Jewish from Nazareth in Galilee. She is spared from original sin upon birth, pertained to as the Immaculate Concepcion, which is a gift from God. She is the chosen one - the one who will conceive Jesus in her womb through the power of the Holy Spirit as announced to her by the angel Gabriel. Thus, earning the title Virgin Mary. She is not to be mistaken with Mary Magdalene who is a prostitute but atoned for her sins, returned to God through Jesus, and is forgiven. <br>  <br>  You may not opt to read the Holy Bible if you are not a Christian nor research that much.

If it wasn't fiction, then this answer will make less sense.<br>  <br>  It may sound crazy, but this is what fiction is for.  We watch a fictional story (or read it) and in a way, we get to rehearse in our heads doing the same thing.  Usually, it has to do with coping with some tragedy or problem that we might someday face, like losing someone we love or fighting an injustice.  Fiction actually helps us face these problems because we've already seen them played out on TV or whatever and we have some idea of what to expect.<br>  <br>  But sometimes, what we end up rehearsing is something we'd never really want to do, like killing our parents.  I'm willing to bet that while you're thinking about killing your parents, you're thinking about the terrible consequences that would result:  you would regret it because you love them, you'd go to prison, you'd be orphaned and have to cope with life on your own, etc.  These are the things you're really rehearsing--by thinking about them, you know even better (as if you didn't before) that you'd never want to do it.<br>  <br>  So go on and think about it, and take this scenario out to its awful conclusion.  It would be the worst thing in the world, the worst mistake you could make.  Now the day may come when your parents really make you angry, and you have a fleeting thought about killing them, but you've rehearsed the consequences of doing it.  That will keep you from acting on your impulse (in the very unlikely event you might actually consider it).  You wouldn't be one of those kids that do it without thinking it through because you HAVE thought it through.  <br>  <br>  It might help you to write a fictional story of your own in which someone kills their parents and then regrets it.  That might be a way to get it off your chest without having to risk worrying anyone that you might actually be considering it.  Whenever I'm thinking about something like this, I write a story and let my characters go through the situation instead.  When I'm done, I don't think about it anymore.<br>  <br>  Have you ever thought about how a writer comes up with the stories you see on TV or read in a book?  How do they write about serial killers or terrible disasters where a lot of people die?  Now you know.  (It's why writers are often seen as a little weird.)|`|sc76O7h6aa	The fact that you realize this is a fantasy is good. If you really thought this and planned it , I would think of turning  myself in to the authorities( the police). If this is a thought you get often  I suggest you try to express the anger you feel by talking to a counselor at school or ask Mom or Dad if they can talk to you about how to be angry in a healthy way. People get angry. That is reality. Healthy anger involves saying  what you feel and why you feel that way and what you hope for . eg. I feel......... (You fill in the blank )  when you do or say..... (You fill in the blank).  To get this problem resolved to the point where we can get along I ask that.......(You fill in the blank with a behavior or two  you would like to have happen)
CQR9OOddaa	This helps me with nightmares<br>  Go to bed with the light on and fall asleep watching the happiest (or your favorite) movie/ tv show you can think of, or that is on tv at the time|`|bjqjkDMHaa	You can't really stop your dreams from being about this, there's no proven way to do that....   First off; dreams are these weird things our brain tells us in between being asleep and waking up.  You don't remember dreams unless you were waking up as you were having them...so first off: get better quality sleep, empty your bladder before you go to bed, make sure you don't leave anything too noisy running that could wake you up...etc.   So if you could stay asleep all night, theoretically, there is less chance of you remembering these dreams.<br>  Then the scientific basis of dreams themselves: dreams are basically random signals from the subconscious brain that it sends to the thinking part, and the thinking part goes nuts trying to make sense of it all... so they can't really explain why you have recurring dreams other than sheer chance, if you're obsessed with one thing and think about it all the time, your thinking brain part is more likely to label some random signal from the subconscious brain as being about that... making sense so far?  So try to remember: dreams are random, they don't mean anything at all about you, its just something your brain cobbled together as its random masterpiece...in this incidence, a very scary one.   <br>  You're better off spending time dealing with your wakeful anxiety about the pregnancy than you are trying to modify your dreams...<br>  some people with really bad recurring nightmares try to do something called lucid dreaming, it's where you slowly train yourself to figure out that you're dreaming while you're still in the dream, and change it around so that you like it.  I've tried it before, I made it like I was flying, it was soo cool, cuz you kno, it felt real like dreams do.  But it can be very hard to get it just to where you can modify the dream.<br>  So that's an option...<br>  Then for how you should deal with the anxiety: I think  you ought to talk to a counselor or therapist, a lot of women get depressed during their pregnancy or even after the delivery, it's called post-partum when it happens after the baby's born...<br>  I think educating yourself about pregnancy is a good idea and focusing on preparing for the birth will help you, I mean, prepare for what you do have a chance to control--if you know about the problems, you can spot them sooner and lessen the risk for complications.  I was really premature--two months--and here I am at fourteen talking about pshychiatry...I am no doctor, just a teenager, but I can tell you this: most deliveries and pregnancies go fine.<br>  some of it might be all the weird hormones you get during pregnancy, Idk....  but odds are, your baby is gonna be fine.  Even if something does go wrong--think of this--pretty soon, in just a couple weeks, if something did go wrong, she'd be viable and could be delivered early and grow up to be a normal, healthy child.|`|vgpuTBmSaa	you may get very disturbing dreams during pregnancy. they are a sign of the fear of changes coming and will stop when you get used to the situation. for now, it will help you to talk to people about the content. it will put things into perspective.<br>  by the way, congrads!|`|57bc2e76c4c22f51ec6b0569135c682eaa	The next time this happens, after you calm down, remember as much of the dream as you can.

As you write it down, change the ending so that it turns from something terrifying to something happy, & write that down instead. I can't think of an example b/c I don't know your dream.

6IXrgxqSaa	Hi Linda. First we have to understand that the economic crisis goes deeper than money issues. The global crisis is general and ongoing. It not appears not only in the worlds economic realm but we also experience the crisis in education, drugs, depression, science, ecology, disease, breakdown of the family unit, threat of war, terror and so on. Many "leaders" of our countries, economists, bankers and officials in industry are already starting to say that we have a problem of mistrust and broken connections. Yet with their lack of general understanding and old egoistic habits they don't have a true solution. Being that we are in a global crisis, it requires a global solution.<br>  <br>  The cause behind our the current global crisis is caused by humanity's egoistic relation between one another. Man's egoism. Man is willing and ready to exploit everyone for the sake of his own personal gain. It is our egoism in humanity that brings us us all the troubles/suffering felt in our lives which includes the growing global crisis in the world today. It's being revealed more and more each day how much all of humanity is interconnected and dependent of one another like cells in a body. We learn from Nature that for a body or a unit to operate optimally it has to follow the law of Nature which is altruism. Reciprocal giving. This exists at all levels of nature except in the connections in humankind.<br>  <br>  This means all parts of a whole work for the benefit and well-being of the whole. That's how it maintains balance and stays healthy. Just like the way it works in the body you are in now. In our world the cells are individual people and humanity is the whole of the body. Imagine if the cells and the organs in your body behaved towards each other the way people behave in relation to one another caring only for themselves with no concern for others (society). Basically that's like cancer to a human body.<br>  <br>  We have reached a situation in the development of humanity where we are one global village. One global family. And in that one family everyone hates each other and attempts to hide it, so how can that family exist? Imagine yourself in a family where no one speaks to the other, everyone hates each other, everyone holds a knife behind their back and thinks about how to get everything and everyone thinks all the others can die as long as he or she is saved. This is the situation we are in today all over the world. People can't have the same egoistic connections we had in the past. The crisis will end when each person will begin to think about everyone else instead of himself.  This is what has to happen or if not our global troubles will not pass and only grow in all areas of life.<br>  <br>  We will soon come to realize that our good future depends on the correct attitude between us. Whether we like it or not Nature is pushing us to this correct relation between one another. Once we change our egoistic connection to one of altruism we will see all our social systems excel and the world's abundance will be revealed. We have to learn how to live in the global integral world that is now being reveled to us in order for humanity to unite and use the crisis as a springboard to a better world. The law of Nature will continue to push us to the same goal of balance by the blows of life and the growing global crisis if we do not start to correct our connections in humanity.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGf4fEFvsIQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGf4fEFvs...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhoTCiNrdW4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhoTCiNrd...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQJNaCcmAoA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQJNaCcmA...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2umf7LXLuyk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2umf7LXLu...</a>|`|Ch9TedMcaa	bad mortgage loans, declining consumer confidence, very little regulation of the markets|`|0hgTGSZbaa	Certain bad and unforeseeable financial events that caught the world and country by suprise.|`|872f4d28837b0b839ed695238bef2e97aa	People wanted to buy more things so they asked for more loans than they could afford to pay.  The banks did their part too, they gave out loans without checking people's finances.  This went on for years and years, everyone was happy.  According to wikipedia it was banks who first stopped giving out new loans, then people stopped buying houses, which drove house prices down and now people had more debts than assets and eventually couldn't pay their loans anymore, which broke banks, which made it difficult for companies to finance themselves, which caused layoffs, which drove down consumer spending, and that's where we are i think.<br>  <br>  IMO it's all the advertisers fault.

It was small gradual things that had a dominoes effect. Small demand in shops meant companies were making less profit which meant they had let workers go meaning those workers had less disposable income. This may seem small but is actually very big as without demand comes loss. The less people are spending the less cash flow companies have, and its global because the UK purchase goods overseas meaning international companies now are out of business as their is no demand as more people are being "layed off" Also another cause is the prices of oil. It is more expensive to ship goods from other countries so prices are increasing. And another reason is the whole loan system in America and england. Banks have been giving money out that people just cant afford to pay back. Which has lead to the economy being in recession which could soon turn into a depression and could stay like this for as long as 15 years!
QmbrXrdIaa	First thing I would do is apply for University. Once you have been accepted, then you have a general idea of the way your life is headed for the next few years and can then begin making goals.<br>  <br>  You will need to secure a Student Loan with your government. I live in Canada, so I thin it's a lot easier here to do so. Nonetheless, this is your future and you need to get all your ducks in a row. <br>  <br>  Okay so now your going to school, can pay for it, what's next? Probably securing a place to live. Depending on your credit history, I would suggest buying something as opposed to renting (for obvious reasons). If you have a very responsible friend that you can go into this with, that would make things easier. Otherwise, you're going to have to find a place close to the school to rent. <br>  <br>  Your landlord or mortgage broker will need to see your credit history, pay stubs, possibly bank statements, and references. You need these locked down and ready to go before you walk into the building.<br>  <br>  Utilities companies will require a downpayment of a few hundred dollars before they sey your account up. Don't worry - you will get this back at the end of one year if you're a good payor.<br>  <br>  Depending on your financial situation. I wouldn't even consider buying a car until I am finished University. Things will be tight and a vehicle isn't as much an asset as it is a giant, depreciating, gas guzzling, huge insurance premiums, maintenance needing, expense.<br>  <br>  Alternately, I would suggest bussing it but talk to your parents about adding you to their insurance. Whether you drive their car or not... this will save you thousands in the long run; because when you are ready to make that big purchase, you will already have insurance history. <br>  <br>  For the next few years while you're in school, it's going to be pretty much the same thing. You'll need a job, and need to pass those exams. <br>  <br>  Apply for a credit card. Not because you need one. But because you need to establish a credit history. Go to you bank, tell them what you want the credit card for - any small balance will do. Make sure you use the card, but more importantly, pay it off in full, on time, every month. <br>  <br>  If possible, also apply for something like an RRSP loan (or whatever americans have for retirement). Even if you put a lump sum into one every year, the loan will increase your credit score if you're a good payor.  !!and it's tax deductible!!<br>  <br>  Savings accounts aren't the greatest vehicle for savings. The money is liquid but the interest is less than inflation, so you're still losing money having it sittting there. Do some research - you'll find somehitng that's right for you.<br>  <br>  By the time you're done school, this whole recession thing will be long over. So now you're all ready to go make some money and pay off those loans.<br>  <br>  If you were able to buy an apartment before you went to school, by now you would have built up some equity from the property. This can be used as a line of credit and applied as a downpayment on a new place for you to live. Don't sell the apartment, rent it out.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	that's great! don't be afraid to ask the people in your life for help and advise. get job, save some money and look for an apartment. usually you can find good deals in the paper. call them and ask for an application. and remember, no credit is better than bad credit. go to a bank and just tell them what you have in mind as in, checking and/or savings accounts. don't invest in the market because the economy is bad right now.|`|RvmYqQtRaa	Talk to the bank for any accounts. This stuff is pretty basic. I mean apartment you just answer ads by calling or emailing people and there's a ton of cheap cars online. What you really should be asking is how to pay bills/taxes, raise kids, all that good stuff. Actually if you can buy a house.|`|Gfu1Nm0Gaa	Hi - you are very smart to ask for help - that's the first step.  Next is get a job to pay for the apartment, car, savings account.  Learning how to do these properly can be a challenge but it doesn't have to be. Look in the classified advertisements of your newspaper - there you will find ads for apartments for rent - be sure to only look at the ones you can afford at this time.  Don't have to take the first you look at either - gain experience by looking at several and then make a decision based on cost, condition, location, and furnished or do you have your own furniture.  Look for one with a washer and dryer in the building if possible, this is very important.  Car buying is about the same - look at many before you purchase, consider cost, monthly payment, condition, mileage, etc.  Savings account.  Go to your local bank -have at least $25.00 with you (some banks say you have to start with more) and go to the teller, tell her you want to open a savings account, bring with you your identification - drivers license, birth certificate,etc. Shop around here, too.  sometimes Credit unions that your employer are affiliated with will take a certain amount out of each pay check and deposit into your savings account at your direction - this way, you don't see it, you don't spend it.  Christmas club is another good way to save.  I have it taken out of my account and in October when the check comes, I take half and buy a CD (Certificate of Deposit) at the bank.  This pays a little more than a savings account and you have to leave the money in there longer to get the percentage rate, but it's worth it in the long run.  Good luck to you - sounds to me like you have a good head on your shoulders.  .|`|RkBlMyHRaa	Ok to get an apartment you check out places for rent in the paper, give them a call and arrange a time to see the place, same with the car check the for sale sections in your local paper on in Australia we have the trading post which is a whole newspaper of all different things for sale.<br>  As for a savings account just take some ID and money to a bank, they won't be able to open the account quick enough!!!<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|OlS4uijKaa	It is overwhelming getting out into the real world, but you will be ok as long as you do your research on things and talk to those you respect when you have a question about things.  Don't be afraid to ask a million questions, because if you don't , you will be really mad when something goes wrong. When you graduate first thing to do is get a car. Buy a reliable used car with low monthly payments. If you can put some money down it is best. Then find yourself an apartment (look online at apartmentguide.com or forrent.com) also look in the paper. Sometimes you have to take a roommate to afford rent. Nothing wrong with that.  TO set up banking accounts just go to the bank you want to do business with and the advisors will do all the rest. Don't let them talk you into any programs or anything else with fees-you don't need that stuff. Make sure that you set up a checking account and savings account with no fees. Read the fine print.  <br>  Don't worry too much about things because you will learn things as you go. There will always be someone who will answer your questions and utilize the internet too. Good luck in all that you do!

The women are being oppressed because they are forced to do something whether they want to or not.

1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	Yes I have been there. It's like a dark hole that you can't seem to pull yourself out of. First, I tried everything to overcome it myself. I tried to read books, positive affirmations, excercise, making myself be around other people but nothing worked. Eventually I quit answering my phone and felt hopeless. It didn't help that I also live with chronic pain from failed back surgeries so I felt bad physically as well. I finally spoke to my Dr. about it and was put on an antidepressant. I really didn't want to go that route, but honestly I am thankful I did. It has helped me tremendously. Even though I still have down times, I don't feel totally hopeless & worthless. I also spoke to a counselor a couple of times and that helped as well. What I finally realized is that deep depression like that isn't just a mood & it's certainly not a choice. It's a chemical imbalance in the brain that medication can level off & help you feel more "normal". Get some help. It's nothing to be ashamed of or afraid of. You don't feel like a zombie or feel anything really from the meds. Just after a couple of weeks you feel like you're coming out of the dark & are able to be more like yourself again. You don't have to live this way. Go see your family Dr. Good luck & feel better.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Me?Never.<br>  I don't get sad very often,but really mad.<br>  When I get sad,I know what everybody will tell me the same thing if I tell them how I feel.<br>  That's why I don't share my feelings with anyone.How I get out of it?I know everyone must have told you this,but even if you don't feel like listening to music,not at all,listen to some happy,upbeat song.|`|OaxhMKr5aa	Yes a few times and im actually falling back into that hole right now........|`|2eztcCO0aa	I've been that depressed. (My husband died a little over a year ago.) <br>  <br>  The last episode was in November.  I remember sitting on the edge of my bed and wishing I could just die and have it all be over.<br>  <br>  I got out of it by repeating this to myself:  This is just temporary.<br>  <br>  And it was.  Part of the problem was that I was exhausted.  I made a point of getting to bed earlier at night and staying there until I've had a good 7 or 8 hours of sleep every night.  A solid sleep schedule is very important.<br>  <br>  Then I scheduled something to do every day of the week so I'd have a reason to get out of bed and get dressed.  Once I was up and dressed, it was easy to get through the day and do all the things I needed to do.<br>  <br>  Focus on other people.  Instead of hanging out with friends, do some charity work.  Help someone.  Ask yourself every day what you can do to make someone else's life better.  That works better than anything else.|`|ryHfKxMnaa	yeah all my life. its a very 'safe' feeling, i used to take comfort in it. i loved wallowing in my own self pity, i stayed home and did nothing, slept all day for a very long time. i had a lot of unresolved feelings that i didnt even know where bothering me that eventually surfaced and i got over them and got bored and felt like living again.|`|ixHwF4apaa	very often|`|f91c3c56fab52fa3b6e292e4b22470f7aa	im feeling exactly like u... and believe me... friends are making it worse. my mom is also noticing my depression.. but i brush it off and say that i have too much tension for college.... witch isnt the case. <br>  i do hope u feel better, it isnt fun living like this :\
3b6face01da47e04ffc0e33e45f7bf70aa	Perhapes. Angst is basically anxiety. Distress. <br>  <br>  noun, plural -ties. 1. distress or uneasiness of mind caused by fear of danger or misfortune: He felt anxiety about the possible loss of his job.  <br>  2. earnest but tense desire; eagerness: He had a keen anxiety to succeed in his work.  <br>  3. Psychiatry. a state of apprehension and psychic tension occurring in some forms of mental disorder. <br>  <br>  <br>  ^^^^^^----actual definitions if that helps at all.<br>  <br>  Anyway, maybe he's a Scorpio or Cancer. Do you know his Zodiac sign? It'll probably help you better to understand him. <br>  <br>  That or his childhood? Maybe some events that made him 'angsty'.<br>  <br>  <br>  Aside from that, "We're not who we are." makes me think of someone who is an 'old soul' so to speak. Beleiving that people are reincarnated from others before them in a constant stream of re-existance.<br>  <br>  Or-><br>  <br>  It could mean that we live for others, therefore making us less ourselves, and more what others ask us to be. It's being unable to truely express yourself through other ways besides something like anonomous grafitti because others have expectations.<br>  <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  People never truely show them trueselves (especially those without someone they truely trust) because we are afraid of others reactions. It's possibly insinuating that people are 'fake' or 'phony' because being one's true self is an intimidating act to preform. It's easier to just 'be' someone 'else' and pretend to fit in and mould to those encompasing us. <br>  <br>  <br>  That's my take on his saying, which I think says a LOT about him. He's probably deep and emotional, especially on the inside and maybe not so much on the outside because of insecurities in being that 'self-like'. If you know what I mean. Complex personality. Not a bad thing. Just a hard thing to deal with when you're at the center of the complexity. AKA the fingers of the spray nozzle. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped some how. I dont know if I answered the angst part, but maybe knowing different views on the phrase might give you some insight to him. If I knew more I could analyze further ( I hate that word, 'analyze' becuase it feels like I'm doing this without emotion and by the text book, but I'm not. I feel for this guy even from this one phrase lol. I totally relate with it.).|`|1uzNfAcpaa	he seems a little older to be going through angst right now, though you could never really know what goes on in a persons mind. Honestly, hes your friend, talk to  him as you would alwayss do and try to derive an image from how he is acting, if its out of the norm. Though of course hes right, we really aren't who we are.
3vmmvRdYaa	The way you are feeling is understandable. I'm a girl, so I know this.Lol<br>  In a sense, that was pretty ****** up of your friend. I think she should have been a little more considerate of your feelings about the situation,whether or not you told her the way you felt about those people, she could have taken a hint by your body language. I assume you seemed happy, but only because you wanted your friend to have a good time.<br>  Don't worry about it. Just let it pass. If you let those people put you down by making you feel out of place, it's only going to eat at your self confidence. Who cares if they looked at you like "Wtf". You should have gave them the finger and laughed. They'll probably be knocked up by the time they hit 19. (That was mean, but it will probably make you laugh).<br>  Life is too short to worry about moments like this. =] If you need anything further, you can message me.
TyTFTIJOaa	I've wondered that before, and although I can't tell you why, I can tell why I'm glad that we have those feelings. If everything was always good, always awesome... how superficial would it be? Even if people are content with that.... ok here's a better way of explaining it. Suppose from now on, every day of your life, you're given your favorite kind of food to eat, lets say fudge, and lets say that you almost never get it. At first you'll be like,"Cool!" But after a while, that rare food will become normal. (like how happy all the time would become just normal ad regular) But lets say that one day you get your least favorite food, (spinach or something) and its like that for a month. Then when your given  fudge again, compared to the spinach it will taste even better than before. And... do you really want a calm and relaxed life? Wouldn't that get boring? I guess to wrap up... wouldn't the good times seem sooooo much better if you could compare them to the bad?<br>  <br>  Also it gives you experience.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! ^^|`|vIXttNHGaa	cause we're humans alyssa thats why. we were programmed that way.<br>  plus, YOU missy never put in question marks and i do believe there are spelling and grammerical errors in that question. tsk tsk tsk....<br>  ~c.~|`|3b6face01da47e04ffc0e33e45f7bf70aa	If we didnt have all of that, the good things would never be as good. We'd never grow stronger and be able to help others get through same experiences. <br>  <br>      The planet started off as a smoldering giant orb-like rock. Heated and too intolerable to live on. Then as it cooled and settled, it not only supported life, but allowed it to strive. Now a days, there are daily fluctuations betweem weather, light, colors. And that's for balance. If there ever was a Utopia, there would be a certain end, and it would simply be the complete and total oposite of a calm, peacful, relaxed state. It would be mass distruction and darkness.<br>  <br>     There needs to be balance, that's what holds the planets in spot and people on two feet. Balance. Humans especially are created in such a way that we dont like things to stay the same. While animals in the wild are happy to go about their life as any other generation of their species, humans want change, growth and expansion. And while some wont admit it, diversity. That's what makes human life different from others. We constantly want to change and reform. In order to do that, there is trial and error, good and bad, ying and yang. <br>  <br>      It's tough, but it's why we have come in such strides to being something completely different from what we started from. It's not just about one life time, it's about time in general. <br>  <br>     You can even think of life like a minute. You start at 1 (level of happiness lets say), then work to 60 seconds (really happy), then you're back at one, and counting back up. Thus, time passes because we move from 1-60 seconds. If you were to stay at 1 or 60, or even 30 (which is technically balance), you go no where in time. Up and down up and down. That's the only way to it.|`|1CgK5Le6aa	Emotions are adaptations, like thumbs and eyes. Fear is the most obvious, it's designed to let you react to your environment. Humans have evolved as social creatures, so the same environmental stimuli that created our capability for love created our capability for anger. They all tie us together and maintain social order. Shame, depression, broken-heartedness, they all are warnings that you are losing your place in your tribe band, culture, society, etc., therefore risking your survival. Anger, betrayal, suspicion, are all ways to ensure you react when another member is breaking the order or risking group survival. Love, pleasure, happiness, pride, appreciation, they all reinforce good behavior for group cohesiveness. Why do you think we love sex? It propagates survival of the species. At this point in our evolution, it would do us well as individuals to work to learn to be calm in the face of adversity, but in the jungle you need adrenaline. Such is the point of civilization, law, and justice, to move past the jungle. We're not there yet, but I think we're beginning to see the light.|`|fTrlerk7aa	I have also thought hard about this. but then i realized that, without negative feelings, we wouldn't really no what happy feelings felt like! hope this helps...|`|cXm6cLcpaa	Life is full of ups and downs...  It makes us stronger :)
2eztcCO0aa	There's nothing wrong with still being a virgin.  But there is something wrong with giving it up to a 20-year-old, so don't do it.  He may even be committing a crime by having sex with you; he could be sent to prison and labeled a sex offender for life.<br>  <br>  When you're ready to give up your virginity, you won't be scared.  In fact, that's how you'll know you're ready.  So relax.<br>  <br>  You won't die a virgin unless you die in the next couple of years.  That's a very remote possibility.  It might seem that you're going to be a virgin forever, but that's only because you've been one your entire life.  But you've got another 60 or so years to go with any luck.<br>  <br>  If you think about it, it's pretty funny to think you'll die a virgin just because you are a virgin now.  I know it made me laugh. :-)|`|1487d1674981b6aea0adec310c43a272aa	You need to wait.  If you are still having doubts or fears then you need to wait.  <br>  The person you give your virginity to you will remember for ever and ever.  You can not give it to anyone else.  Is this guy that special to give that too?<br>  If you do decided to have sex make sure you use protection.  Having a baby is not any thing you need to be doing.  And baby-daddies are there for 18 plus years.  <br>  I would say after six months to a year is when you really get to know about someone.  <br>  If it was me i would wait.|`|nLXKmcnBaa	go ahead and have sex... <br>  <br>  its the most beautiful thing a human being can do. <br>  <br>  now, if you don't beleive you are mature enough to handle it.. then you can thank the media annd multiple flase organization preaching about the dangers of sex.... ( which is similar to preaching about the dangers of driving or riding a bike.)|`|jXAbTovcaa	Its nothing to be afraid of it might be painful the first time but you will find it pleasurable the 2nd time or so|`|Ug7Om1qyaa	Nothing to fear but fear itself|`|TyTFTIJOaa	Well, for one, if there's any part of you that wants to wait, you need to tell him to wait, because this is something that you can't reverse. If he really likes you the way you like him, then he'll understand. Another thing, it's not bad to be afraid to lose virginity at such a young age. I would advise you to wait..... but if you're sure you want to, and you have plans for a baby or something, then the best way is to just do it (heh Nike motto here). Like, let it happen. But once again, I'd say wait til you're older and out of school. Good Luck! ^^|`|k4XLr4TUaa	Well if you fear to lose your virginity than obviously your not ready to. You want to because maybe your boyfriend is older and mature, making this pressure on you to be on his level. But you have to let him know that your not ready.. if he doesn't take it in that your young and not ready than break up with him because he must only want you for your body. Your not going to die a virgin your only 16 for frigging sakes. Chill yourself now. Your not suppose to 'make' plans to have sex, its suppose to have naturally when your ready and its the right moment.
m16gf9mzaa	I have mixed emotions.  I mean, I'm getting near 40, and always thought I would have a family.  But then again, the older I get the more terrified I am that I would actually be as bad a mother as mine was, because I see the ways I am like her.  So, you know, I can say I love my kids so much I didn't force them to have me for a mother.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	?

uXqDYPNVaa	I have a much easier time getting guys to see me as a friend than as a potential girlfriend. I suppose that's my own doing, since I'm not much of a flirt, and I like being one of the guys. But you'd think I'd have developed a mutual attraction somewhere by now.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	I have to admit I cant ever recall feeling that way.

Especially the cougars|`|hOGAgVASaa	lmfao that a good one ( the headline)|`|Z7kZdBkXaa	Yes, I felt this all the time.<br>  <br>  Everyday I'd go to school with a plan, some sort of motive to go somewhere and do something, connect with a girl. There were all these girls I liked and I would always try to talk to them but it never worked, the just seemed to ignore me or talk down to me. With every loss and condescending conversation my self confidence got lower, and lower... and lower.<br>  <br>  Then I told myself "why me? why do I have all these problems with girls?" And so I looked at all of the people, all my friends who didn't have the same problem I was having and tried incredibly hard to find common traits about them, things they were doing that prevented this problem.<br>  <br>  And my conclusion was simple, a single thing, trait that allowed for these people to connect to the opposite sex. Confidence.|`|emOhSyY5aa	No. I am very friendly with the opposite sex. My male friends tell me that they feel very comfortable around me and they can be themselves when I'm around. Some of them say they don't get that same feeling with other girls. I think its because that some women see men as monetary gain. And hell, if I was a man that would be uncomfortable to me as well. People are not banks, why is that hard for some to understand?|`|vG7fljVzaa	ughh tell me about it. All my friends have guys liking them and I'm just there. I don't know why.

If you care about the people who don't interact with you instead of the people who do, you're likely to be very depressed.

TyTFTIJOaa	I personally want fame, but not like movie star or sports star fame. I eventually want the kind of fame that will get you remembered throughout history. And also, you could have all the money in the world, and it's still not as awesome as having people come up to you, look up to you, recognize you, and think good of you for what you've done.|`|fTrlerk7aa	Well, you only live once, and most people would rather die a legend, than with lots of money...|`|7MzgKsf5aa	I would think it's either one of them or both of them for some people.  For me, the money is the main perk, while fame is just a bonus, although not always a welcome bonus.  I would like to have enough fame to where people know who I am, but not have everyone wanting to follow me with cameras when I go to take the trash out in the morning and reporting bogus rumors whenever they see me out with some guy.
2eztcCO0aa	No.  People used to think that you'd have all the brain cells you'd ever have by the time you were in your twenties and after that it was all downhill, brainwise.<br>  <br>  But now it's been proven that people can grow new brain cells all throughout their lives.  You can even help the process along by reading, doing puzzles, hanging out with other people, etc.  <br>  <br>  There are many, many people who didn't do anything great until they were older.  Too many to list.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	Artists, musicians, scientists, writers, performers, etc. - Many didn't even start doing their thing until much older.<br>  <br>  I guess people say that about the 20s because many are in college and learning at that time, but some people do attend college later in life.<br>  <br>  It also depends on what your brain is on in your 20s.|`|bF3DAb1faa	you can do something great at anytime - intellectual peak does not mean that you form a solid theory or model|`|TyTFTIJOaa	What I heard is that the male brain hits it's peak in their twenties, but not females. It shouldn't be a problem though, (to the men,) cuz it doesn't look like it made people retards, right? But yeah I'm pretty sure it peaks for males at that time.

Serpents are ancient symbols, often associated with goddesses of fertility.  Becuase they live in the ground serpents may represent healing, nurturing earth.  Alternativley, they may be emblems of the mysterious dangers of the underworld.  The christian tradition incorporated the latter meaning into its mythology, making snakes an embodient evil, particulary the evil of temptation (e.g., the snake in the Garden of Eden).  In some cultures in southern asia, serpents symbolize primordial spiritual power.<br>      The many symbolic meanings for the snake  make this a complex dream symbol to interpret.  Depending on the context, snakes can represent threats and temptations or healing or spiritual power. For Frued, serpent dreams were covert refrences to the male organ. As a more general pychological symbol, snakes emerging out of the ground may indicate the emergence of unconscious (e.g., repressed) material into the light of consciousness." wow thats alot of info

kt2i6eKXaa	first of all, if you're in your early teenage years, then those dreams are completely normal. having wet dreams isn't bad; just ask yourself this: "are you hurting anyone"? No, any Psychology teacher will tell you that those feelings are completely normal. It's all part of growing up. If you're a guy, that's how you penis grows in your sleep, so it's not something you wanna end i presume. Anyhow, dream away, it's pass eventually.|`|M1u6fdZCaa	Talk to someone, perhaps a therapist about your dreams and pray before you go to sleep.|`|aXtwn7Usaa	I tend to have bad dreams too. A psychologist will tell you  that you are having bad dreams either because of something you ate, slept hungry or too full, where thinking about what you have dream about before sleeping, or is a vision, premonition. I will try to eat good before sleeping and not think about bad things or worry, just relax, take a warm shower maybe light some candles, put a slow song, and try to think positive, tell yourself that you won't have any bad dreams and if your a christian pray.
un0C52G8aa	It's still present, despite what some people think. They just believe it doesn't because they have never experienced it personally. One of the more flagrant ways it exists is in health care. Most new medications are intended for men and they are often tested on men before they are released to the general public. Another is with the attitudes of the doctors themselves. They are far less likely to take a woman's symptoms seriously and will try to convince her that it's all in her head or that she's faking it because she's looking for sympathy. Women are more likely to die from heart attacks for that reason and also due to the fact that they usually suffer from different symptoms so by the time they are correctly diagnosed, it's often too late.<br>  <br>  In the workplace, women are less likely to get hired, they aren't taken as seriously, and they often are not made aware of new openings that can help them advance with their companies. If they have children, they are the ones who are expected to take time off from work to stay home with sick children or to take them to various appointments. It's rare if a man does that. As a result, women are mistakenly assumed to be more sickly than men and that's why they take off more time from work. The types of jobs both men and women can get often differ even if both have the same qualifications. Men are more likely to be hired as management trainees while women are often put into areas like human resources, for example.<br>  <br>  Women are more likely to be ripped off when it comes to car repairs, home improvement projects, and any other area where is is assumed they don't know anything about.<br>  <br>  These are a few examples. I hope these help.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	its history not present, so you need to find a relevant topic.|`|AA11937917	that is extremely, extremely general.<br>  <br>  I would pick a specific aspect, such as hiring preferences in a specific field, such as women coaches in sports, or as airline pilots... among many other possibilities.

PFCfKKtSaa	Nearly 10 years ago, I would of been around 9, and I dreamt a bunch of baby angels came down from the sky and hovered right outside my windows. And then about 7 years later, I suffered a near death (from something I had in me since birth, so it was bound to happen no matter what). And I just always thought they were related, to that's why I had that dream.|`|UeUymAjwaa	never share your dreams people, only with those u trust........but u guys will think i am a fool for saying this and u will say it......whatever i tried......|`|Nakvqxdmaa	crunk is correct in saying that i will say hes a fool. crunk is a fool. <br>  i once had a dream that i was trapped in a basement with a bomb. an ursula (of the little mermaid) type creature was the villain. thats all i remember
4OEOxOmPaa	The bible is a book of fairy tales. Noah's ark is a rip off from the Epic of Gilgamesh. You should realize that the bible is not the only holy book. Also, Anthropology and Evolution shouldn't be equated with atheism. I believe in a universal God. I just don't jump to "God did it" or "Go of the Gaps" if I don't have an answer. Please remember, since you brought up biblical figures, there is no historic evidence of any. That also includes Jesus, who is a rip off of Horus and Mithra.|`|81BTYiWqaa	All lies. The writers had their turbans on too tight it restricted their blood supply.|`|vhlORK4Waa	OK, I shall bite.<br>  <br>  Your first problem is that you are taking the BIble as a source document, and taking it literally. The Bible is a collection of stories written over thousands of years, incorporating myths and tales from other societies and using them to make sense of the world and the people that collated it into one document.<br>  <br>  The Bible is not literally true - A divine being did not stick out a finger and go WHOOSH and there was the earth, the stars, the planets. The creation stories (yes there are two) in Genesis are just stories to explain how earlier peoples thought the world might have come into being.  I do not think they every intended these tales to be believed as literally true, this is a modern misunderstanding of the use of tales and mythology. Unfortunately it makes life very awkward if you do believe the bible to be 100% true.<br>  <br>  The Flood is a universal theme in many early Mediterranean societies, of which the tale of Noah and the Ark is but one of many. It's just one that has made it into this collection of stories, Read up on Catal Hyuk for some interesting thoughts on this.<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve did not exist as such, they are allegories for early humans and yet again, stories to try to understand or make sense of how we are, and how we came to be.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you do some serious reading on comparative theology, and on mythology, folklore, and other religious beliefs, anthropology and ancient history.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|0WQ1VZqPaa	since when does religion need to make sense

cgctTeK7aa	It's great as long as you learn to manage your money and to live as yourself and not what others want you to be|`|TyTFTIJOaa	Every age has it's good times and bad times. Growing up can be fun, remember the experiences before so that you can enjoy them later. I don't want to grow up, I always love the age I'm in then in a few years I'll look back and think, "This is sooo much better!"And I bet that's going to happen in a few more years, when I think that 16 totally beats 14. Since you can't stop it, might as well enjoy it. ^^ <br>  <br>  By the way, you seem very mature for an 11 year old, waaay more mature than my brother. It's good that you're thinking about this now than right before you need to. ^^|`|4NiGsqnCaa	No, No, no! It can be stressful, but it isn't near as bad as some people think it will be.

But by the time you're an adult you'll be able to handle it and you won't even know it's stressful.  You will have some stress in junior high, then a little more in high school, and then a little more in college.  By the time you finish college you will have learned to handle a lot of stress and manage a life that's already pretty complicated.  You'll be so happy not to go to school anymore that getting a job, finding a place to live and getting your taxes paid will seem like a breeze.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about not knowing what you want to do with your life.  You don't have to know what you want to do before you go to college.  You even have time to figure it out once you get there.  And you can decide to do something else even after getting your degree.  A lot of people are very happy doing something completely different than what they've been educated to do.  And all those kids who already know what they want to do will be doing something else too.  You may have to remind them someday about what they once wanted to do.|`|EgA87yR0aa	When you are an adult, you will find a lot of people think that you are doing things wrong and living your life incorrectly no matter what you are doing.  Even if you are very responsible, you will find people that still criticize you.  You have to do your best to figure out how you think a good person should act and then do that, don't worry about other people and be modest so you don't have people making you look foolish.  Do this and you will be fine.  Being financially sound (making sure you have more money than you spend so that you can live without worrying about money) is also very important. The hardest thing is that different people in your life think you should live different ways so it makes you feel torn sometimes.  Try your best, try hard  to achieve your dreams so you don't lose them and if you fail, then find new dreams that are still wonderful.|`|Vmp1KK1iaa	Hey I'm 14 and I have the same fear. I have no idea what I'm going to be or do when I'm older. Don't worry, you don't have too. All you have to do is get good grades in school and then go to college and you can stay until you've figured out what you want to do. The life of an adult is stressful but it only is when you're just starting out. After you've had a few years under your belt you will understand the things in your life. As my grandpa said " Life is like time, the more you waste the less there is ." so stop wasting time worrying about being an adult and spend more time just focusing on the things you have to. Get in that habit and you'll go far. After 20 years you'll go into growing up.

9YbMZBocaa	well your only 15 years old, you've barely begun to live your life.  At the same time these are very formative years for you.<br>  <br>  If you feel like things are awkward around your good friends then ask them why, you have nothing to lose from doing that.  If you want to go out and meet new friends, and other young people then do so. On the weekends after you finish your shifts, go outside and have fun before you find something worth staying in for.<br>  <br>  Life belongs the living, which your clearly doing.  You are more vibrant than your realise, even in depression.  Life belongs to the living so live, go out and meet new people or find things to do in your city/town.<br>  <br>  life can only be boring if we make it out to be that way, your only at the beginning of a very fun and exhilarating ride.

It's not all fun and games. Your kind of like me, but I can open up with friends. I remember really wanting a friend that would hang out with me and do absolutely nothing. Just lay down on a field of grass and look up at the sky. I actually have friends that are like that now, which is really fun(not doing anything haha) but I suggest just tagging along with a group of friends and try to enjoy the activities you participate in. Eventually through those friends you'll meet new people and find someone like yourself and become better friends.|`|tKTE2xxpaa	go out and enjoy while your still young... you might regret it when you got older.. just put limitations in everything you do|`|6CMfKxiMaa	ecstasy!|`|f3ZKyuq0aa	you need to go shopping.|`|Ug7Om1qyaa	Change your attitude. Only you can make you feel better.<br>  Friends are just icing on the cake.|`|k4XLr4TUaa	Your still young. Yeah depression can really alter your life but you should TRY your extreme hardest to overcome it. If you know your life is boring so try something new for a change. It may be a little hard at first, trying opening up on small things don't have to do about your life story.. You could try to actually ATTEND the parties see how it goes and if you don't like because you don't talk to anyone well talk amongst the people you know and maybe those people will introduce you to other people, if you just don't like it in general than i guess its not your thing, try to open up to your circle of friends a bit cause if they don't really want to chill with you than they might just drop you and you have no more friends right? Start going to concerts, etc with them. For meeting new guys, I think your a shy person so you don't even have to flirt with them, just y'know small talk doesn't have to be all flirty and what not and be yourself, and maybe that boy will start to like you and whatever happens, happens. Just cause your friends go to these events and meets new guys doesn't mean you have to be like them. Just chill with them and be yourself, you don't always have to talk.. just try to open your mouth more and not keep quiet because maybe your friends don't want someone who is not like them and your done.. They want someone out-going not boring. No offence..

Don't let him watch very violent movies either tilhe's like a teenager that has an effect on people to. Whether or not you take away the gun, he won't go all girly on you. Guns don't make boys boys. ;-)  Give him action figures.

Maybe you should cut down on the gun playing but don't stop it permanently, this is relative spending time and they are having fun right?
TyTFTIJOaa	Hey, don't worry about it. If you've known this guy for 4 years, then you should be able to talk about anyhint. If you can't yet, you might want to. Tell him your problems so that he feels as if he's there for you, and you're there for him. If you can already do that, and you NEVER fight, that doesn't mean that you never will, it just means that you too are very good at working stuff out. I've never truly fought with anyone of my friends, and I trust them all with my life. So you like the photographer. Whatever, be loyal and everything will work out. Your dream is you're way orf telling yourself in a more obvious way that this is happening. You must've already known all this about yourself, right? you're just... regurgatating it lol. <br>  <br>  Oh, and get more sleep ^^|`|Ruifi0GSaa	Hi,<br>  You need to "unite" some aspect of the photographer personality into your life somehow.<br>  To dump someone in a dream means: Nothing lasts forever. Learn to appreciate what you have. Perhaps you need to let go of something. You may be feeling that something is missing from your life. Fear of losing control.<br>  Hope that helps, good dreams. :)

8ssiOsDzaa	well first of all you can stop watching scary movies and creepy things because at night the whole thing runs again in your head and you can't control it. second, it might sound very stupid but it's been scientifically proven that having nice smells around you makes you have good dreams, and bad smells bad dreams, so you might wana.. don't know, maybe put some perfume or something next to you or on you!<br>  and finally you can think about nice things just before going to bed, and really get exhausted during the day so that when you go to sleep you'd be too tired to have any dreams you might remember when you wake up or feel when you're asleep!|`|AA10148136	why watch these movies if you already know what is going to happen like having bad dreams  bad dreams can also be caused by medication  caffeine  spicy or greasy foods (late at nite)  but as i said lay off the scary movies  your doing it to yourself|`|fTrlerk7aa	It really doesn't matter how many scary movies you watch every day, as long as you watch something nice before you go to sleep. if u don't have time to watch something nice, then make sure that you go to sleep thinking about something you enjoy. You could think about your friends, or your family, or think about one of your favorite activities! hope this helps...|`|gp4RLeSfaa	I gather that these scary movies and creepy videos are the source of your nightmares and terrifying thoughts. So i recommend the advice i gave to you for other question and stop watching these scary movies and videos. Honestly can't you see the connection. Best wishes.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Maybe you need to lay off the scary movies for a while.  I have a similar problem but I still like the high suspense scary movies out there, and I have found that if I watch one to make sure I watch something happy afterwards.  I never watch a scary movie right before going to sleep.|`|PKVl1ZlWaa	put lollies & chocolates under your pillow and you will have sweet dreams. <br>  <br>  lols =] ?|`|G7VvMfPSaa	You should stop watching those creepy and scary movies and clips. That should stop the nightmares from happening.
uXqDYPNVaa	Geez. That's deep even by James Earl Jones standards.
P4WJD6Cpaa	Well sadly that's all they are really taught to do. It is reasoned that nothing can really be cured. So they are only taught about drugs. I would just if you need to go to a therapist. Make sure they know you aren't interested in drug treatment.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Sorry I'm not a big fan of psychiatrist, one reason it's not a proven science<br>  take care<br>  dave
1B7oTAOkaa	your mind isn't altered in any way. you just have a run away imagination. trust me, im 14 and i do that all the time. if you do it b4 sleep you dream that. its perfectly normal though if i wer you id try to develop a social life. you know go to the mall or something.|`|SSlz82Djaa	Not mental at all. Just suffering from severe boredom I reckon.<br>  <br>  Everybody needs friends. Its a fact. Different types of friends too, with differing opinions to engage and stimulate you mentally. Loud friends, quiet friends, outgoing and shy friends, friends who you argue with and friends who think exactly as you do. <br>  <br>  See what local groups you could join, or maybe a there's a sport you could take up?  No teenager should only be pals with their parents. Its just so wrong.|`|9syEUfnqaa	uhm well..first of all. theres nothing wrong with you. im guessing your just really bored and your mind gets off track and wanders off to ideas where you wish you were a hero or that you were important. it's always good to have friends your age. friends are fun, just make sure your acting yourself. <br>  <br>  im guessing your just a little too bored and maybe need to take a walk or enroll in some sports or maybe a dance class that way, you can meet new people.
2vBmRcv6aa	Excercize- seriously run like crazy<br>  It is hard to do when you don't want to move, but it WORKS|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	look first you need to forgot everything and move on to the future forgot the past cause you have more pain if you dont ok dont worry we all here to give you advice ps best answer please|`|IE1LvgD9aa	PRAY|`|vxMJwivPaa	you shouldn't expect anything. you only get disappointed when you expect things. you have to let things go. the real world isn't friendly and won't care if its disappointed or hurt you. it's time to grow up and learn to deal with things. the world won't stop because you're hurting. you need to forget and look towards the future being  brighter. YOU need to take care of yourself and deal. It's time to learn to cope. you may have a sob story and you may be feeling pain, imagine all the people out there that have it worse than you do. you may be hurting, but i'll let you in on a little secret- we're all hurting. it's time that you realize that.|`|1pxKM9Buaa	you could try talking to someone you trust to help sort out your feelings or you could even email me (:<br>  <br>  *don't do anything too drastic, there are other options ..!|`|jZikbLE3aa	u need to find a girl play games go to strip club u have lots of fun|`|kjP8S7WIaa	i know its hard to have a lot of things disappoint you, but just think about the future. not the past. this is a perfect way for you to grow and learn to become a better person. even though it seems to be impossible at this point, not everythings gonna disappoint you.<br>  <br>  just keep in mind-<br>  good doesn't last forever, neither does bad! :)|`|5y2Ga65vaa	try writing about it maybe.<br>  or talk to someone/councilor etc.<br>  i know listening to inspiring music helps get me back up or finding songs i relate  to,.<br>  find something you love to do, and people you love to be around.<br>  it should help :)|`|SGBVNW17aa	You could pray or do something that makes you very happy ?
