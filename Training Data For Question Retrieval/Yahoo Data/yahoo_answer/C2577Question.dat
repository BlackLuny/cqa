I have brought my car to a family friend during a trip home (two states away) and he was kind enough to replace the belt with a Gator belt, and the squealing stopped for a few days.       It has now restarted and squeals every time I start, slow to a stop, or sometimes while idling.  It even happens after driving for as long as an hour.  I have squeezed the belts and they are extremely tight.  I have also sprayed the belts with something sticky (sorry, I really don't know about cars, was given the spray by the same family friend and told to use it if it squeals again).  The belts still squeal even after spraying.      I know there are other things that could be wrong with it: Alternator, bearings, but I have no idea what specifically could be wrong with these.      I can't travel back to the guy who worked on the car anytime soon and I really can't afford to have a mechanic look at it right now and would like to fix it myself if possible.  Will it be?

20090203154955AASArbF	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Passenger liability in car door accident? please help...?	Hi there I would like a little advice,     Today I have received a court summons for an accident I was involved in back in May 2007    I have moved address since then and not received any previous correspondence, here is what happened:    I was travelling in a mini cab at around 8pm, the road we were travelling on had 3 lanes in central london (one bus lane and two other lanes for normal traffic.)  The taxi driver indicated to pull over into the bus lane to allow myself and a fellow passenger to get out, the driver of the car behind took exception to this as he believed the taxi driver did not give enough notice that he was pulling over.     The other driver stopped just short of the taxis rear bumper and proceeded to call the taxi driver some very unpleasant names and offer several rude hand gestures.    We paid the cab driver and I stepped out of the vehicle from the rear door (drivers side), the driver of the other car then had a few choice words for me (at this point he was stationary) I asked him what his problem was (with maybe a few choice words of my own) he then tried to drive past me and the still open door managing to scrape right down the side of his car with my taxi drivers door and almost running me over in the process.  I   decided to give the taxi driver my details to act as a witness in the event of any claim. (against the other driver)    Low and behold I now have a letter saying the other driver is taking me to court to recoup the money for repairs to his car!    Am I really liable for this???    Any thoughts are welcome as this seems laughable considering he was sitting still in his car as I disembarked and then drove at the vehicle I was getting out of as he tried to squeeze past? And can a passenger even be liable for this, is it not covered by the the car owners insurance?    Thanks for reading

20090225065044AAMhSPK	Cars & Transportation;Aircraft	Are the seats in an airplane safe?	It seems to me that if you get into a plane crash, your chances of survival are not in your favor. Logically, airline companies should be designing planes to be as safe as possible to eliminate casualties in an accident. Of course, there's not much you can do if the plane bursts into flames, but what about the seats?      I don't get into an automobile without a full seat belt that covers my chest. I don't want the top half of my body being slung into my steering wheel. On an airplane, who really believes that grabbing your ankles will secure your body in the safest way possible? Why don't the seat belts secure your entire body......specifically the most important part, YOUR HEAD?      Also, would it be logical to place the seats facing backwards? Sure, during takeoff you'll have to push yourself against the force of the plane so you don't crumple into the seat in front of you, and gramma might have trouble due to her back problems, but that's what the full body safety belt could do for you. And ok, so if you crash, the silverware in front of you might impale you as it flies at you 500 miles per hour.

My boss is from back east, and told me a story about a road that washed out - a man saw the newly-created "gulf," stopped his car, got out, and 3 teens were headed towards the deep pit, tried to get them to stop, they flipped him the bird, continued into the pit, and all 3 perished.      Where could I find out about this ?
20090203160303AAxKJuv	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Scion	Scion xD: Good Quality Car?	Since I can drive next year, I've been doing a little research on what car I plan to buy when I get my license. I've been particularly interested in the Scion xD. It has good gas mileage, looks cool, and has a fairly low price. I want to make sure that it is a good quality car, though. All I know about it is what I've seen on the official Scion website- and they're not going to say if it's a poor-quality ride. If you have an xD, how is it? Does it do well in poor weather, hold up well, and is an overall good investment, or does it need repairs often and make you wish you'd bought a Civic (or an Accord; they're my next choices). Or, do you know of a vehicle that is better than an xD that you'd recommend instead?

Then last week, the transmission starts acting up and it wont shift so she took it into a garage... where they told her it was because it was a rebuilt wreck. now, she had no idea because the dealer never told her, and never gave her a salvage title with the car. the question that i have... is that is this illegal? can she sue him for a new car for the same amount of money that she paid for this "new" car? shes so lost so im trying to help out a little. thanks

20090203162548AACsY4i	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Proper way to avoid this accident?	What is the proper way to avoid a head on collision when you are on a two lane road (land barrier separating oncoming traffic, so it's a four lane road, technically), going at 35mph, which is the speed limit, and you see a car about 60 feet away from that is waiting to make a right turn? You are on the right most lane, and just as you get within 30 feet of this car, it suddenly decides to go ahead with the turn.      My conscious attention was focused on the front of the oncoming car as I began to panic and execute the evasive maneuver from my subconscious mind. Like a deer caught in a car's headlights, the only thing I had programmed my subconscious to do as I only thought of the car in front of me was to immediately brake and swerve to the left. As I did this, I saw I came within two feet of the front of the other car as I passed it. It was already quarter way into my lane, so I was forced to swerve onto the other lane. Lucky for me there were no other cars behind or around me. Had there been been a car to my left, I can only imagine that I would have hit it.      What is the proper safety procedure for a situation like this?

She had not driven it since October, so by the time I picked it up it was in her retirement home's garage for about 3 months. The sticker on it said that the next oil change was needed on 8/19 or 17,000 miles (It had 15450ish when I picked it up). Now my dad took it to a friend who runs an auto shop, and he said it doesn't need one yet; it should be fine.Now I don't make very long drives (usually to school, about 5 min away) and it is very cold (north suburbs of Chicago). But I was wondering if the lack of an oil change could have an impact on my car's MPG because it is list at 18/27 mpg but I am only getting 13 (according to the car)?
20090203160245AA6kDrn	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	1994 Explorer - 170k Miles! Any Advice?	Hello. So I've got a 1994 explorer. For a few months now, I've had some transmission problems. I've been needing to put transmission fluid in, pretty often. About 1-2 quarts of type F auto transmission fluid around every 300 miles.. About the last month or so I've been needing to put it in like every 150-200 miles.. When I say "needing to put it", im mean that the car will idle when I accelerate, and then sort or skirt or jerk in forward or reverse once i accelerate pretty hard. It tends to do this more when the car has been cold over night. It will occasionally do it when the car's been warm and used though. I'm wondering what the best advice is, as to fixing/ finding the problem, and if it's worth fixing or not. Any advice is appreciated, as I don't know anything about cars! I had an oil change about 1k miles ago.. Thanks a lot, and have a great day!

20090203161043AAuNqjk	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	New rider - Needs a little help with emerging from junctions (if poss)?	I wonder if anyone has any advice on a little problem im having when dealing with emerging right from a minor road onto a major road.    I have just completed my CBT and have been driving round on a 125cc Yamaha YBR for a few weeks and seem to be running into the same problem (not all the time but every so often). When coming upto the junction I will go through the procedure as taught by the instructor :    Right shoulder check  Indicate right  Right mirror  Move to right of road    (This is where the problems start)    I'll approach the give way line on the road and try to get the earliest Right Left Right check of the major road I can (OK i've decided its clear) I give the right life saver check and away I go.    The problem i'm having is, if I approach the junction to fast I don't have time to clearly check Right Left Right, so i need to stop to do a better check.    If I come in slower I can do a good Right Left Right check but i'm going slower and start to loose balance which makes either the life saver check difficult or it means I need to stop to regain the balance of the bike.    So, what is happening is that usually I have to stop everytime when emerging right so i'm confident I have got a clear view of the road and gives me time to do my lifesaver check.    I have done it before without stopping but feel as if I haven't done a sufficient Right Left Right check and also a late life saver check.    I personally think the problem is i'm trying to rush everything at the end of the junction (but how else am i meant to get a good view of the road unless I do all the checking at the junction). I could also be turning to early when emerging which is making the bike more unstable as well as being unstable due to going at a slow pace.    If anyone has any ideas how to avoid this problem it would be greatly appreciated!!! :)

I noticed my car was "in the red" and was about to overheat as i was driving, so at first I thought maybe i needed more coolant. I turned off my car and heard a fan noise under my engine for like a minute then it stopped. I checked the radiator and it was empty (no coolant) so i put water in there to get to the store to buy more coolant. By the time i bought some the water was already gone (this was only like 10 min) so I put the coolant in drove home again i noticed i was overheating, i checked again and all the coolant had leaked out too..it was all gone, that QUICK! So i asked a couple of men about it, and they say it sounds like it could be a hose or either a water pump. I don't know which it is, i can't drive it anywhere b/c it keeps overheating and i don't want to get it towed for $75 just to get a new hose. So is there a way i could tell what the problem is?    Thanks!

Last August I bought a car on HP from Suzuki Motors (using Kia finance part of GE Capital), I part exchanged my Corsa and paid ￡2000 cash, put the rest on finance. As I was a discharged bankrupt I could not get finance so my partner got the finance in his name. Even though in his name with the finance company I have paid the monthly payment into his bank every month from then to present time (the direct debit was set up from his account).       The log book is in my name, as is the tax and insurance - my partner only as a provisional license so cannot drive it without supervison anyway. We recently split up and I cancelled the direct debit from my partners account and set up a standing order from my account to keep up the payments - problem is my ex partner is now being a pain and saying he wants the car, he says it is in his name so legally he can have it, I have contacted the finance company who said they can only speak to the Account holder regarding this matter - do I have a leg to stand on?       All past payments although paid for by me have come from my ex's account, but it was my car that was traded in and my ￡2000 that was put down when we purchased it and it is me who have paid all the payments!!! I need to know where I stand because at present I have a standing order set up to pay them March's payment. The HP agreement is for 3 years and the agreement was taken out in August (6 months ago), so should I keep up the payments or could my ex at some time in the future come and take the vehicle off me.....I would be grateful for any advice you could give.
20090225065219AArieLy	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Would the failure of my O2 sensor keep my car from starting?	For the past month my car has been bucking, backfiring and sucking down gas like crazy.  The problem seemed to be worse when the car was colder but as it warmed up, it wasn't so bad.  So, I do the key turn check for the codes and nothing shows up, so I figure it just needs a regular tune up, filter changes, spark plugs, ect, ect.  However, a few weeks ago, I get in to my car, try to start it and nothing.  It will turn over but it acts like it's not getting any gas so the engine will start.  The car doesn't smell flooded or anything, it just won't start.  I started to think that maybe the fuel pump might have went out, so, again, I do the key turn to check the codes and it shows the code for the 02 sensor and nothing more.  What I want to know is can the failure of an 02 sensor alone cause my car not to start up, or by chance could it actually be the fuel pump as well that bit the dust.  My car is a 1994 Chrysler Concord, 3.3L engine.  Any and all opinions welcomed!  I just don't want to shell money for parts I may not even need.

20090225070714AAxVa6X	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What does a good brake job entail?	Okay, so I realize what needs to be done to my squeaky brakes (Toyota Tercel) isn't necessarily the same for all cars, but I don't want to get taken for a ride at the auto shop.  It's been 3 or 4 years since I've had them worked on. I had the rotors turned and the pads replaced.  But my dad also mentioned the brake drums.        Also, even after having that work done on them.  The brake pedal sometimes wouldn't go all the way down to the floor, it would vary sometimes. It'd feel kind of high when I pressed it and wouldn't give at all, but the car always stopped.  The auto guy mentioned something about some hydraulic or exhaust part being messed up.  He said it was expensive of course, but I've not had any problems with it, so if it ain't broke...  Any ideas of what I can expect in terms of repairs would be appreciated!

20090304200928AAHcOhT	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How can I decarbon the engine in my car?	I have a 1995 Ford Probe and it smokes upon start up after sitting over night when its really cold outside. When it's warm outside or not really cold it doesn't smoke. I believe I narrowed the problem down to valve stem seals. To fix the problem for now I run Lucas Oil Stabilizer with synthetic oil. I have only used synthetic in the car and I'm the second owner. I did a compression check and it was high, assuming its due to carbon build up since it has a faulty EGR valve. I have heard the carbon build up can also cause some of the smoke and can definitely harm the engine of smoothness, power, etc. I want to know how can I decarbon aka decarbonize my engine. Can anyone please help me? This car has to last me another year and a half because I plan on buying something used, decent, and sporty after I graduate and join the Army.

I started driving about a month ago, 1 to 3 times a week in 2 hour sessions.By the end of my lessons, my instructor said I was a great driver and I had learned everything he could teach.      However,If my dad goes driving with me he is WAY more demanding. He drove cabs and a delivery truck for most of my life,and he is probably the best driver I've ever seen. I know I could learn a lot,but I feel like he's being a little harsh. A tiny little mistake like taking a corner a bit tight or braking too fast and he's on me.       The other day we were in a nightmare of an intersection and as I was about to enter he suddenly yelled at me to "take this turn". I panicked and turned,apparently the wrong way and he yelled even more. He kept yelling for every little detail and eventually I couldn't even concentrate enough to drive.

20090304161234AAunFQ9	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What is causing a short to my starter in my 1992 Isuzu Amigo?	What is causing a short to my starter in my 1992 Isuzu Amigo 2.6 liter 5-Speed. Sometimes when I try to start the engine the starter will not turn. The problem seems to fix itself, then I'll try to start again later and the engine cranks right up. This has been an on going problem. I thought it might be the starter itself, so I replaced it, but It didn't help. Sometimes I will tap on the fuse box on the right hand side of the engine compartment and it will start. Other times I will tap on it and it will not start. When I turn the key all the ignition lights come on and I hear a click, but the starter will not turn. It's not getting power. I have noticed sometimes when the engine cools back down the starter will get power and turn again. I don't see any loose wires anywhere, could there be some kind of fuse causing this or what could it be that's causing my starter to not get power?
