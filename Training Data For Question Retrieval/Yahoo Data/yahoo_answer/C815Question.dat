20090226130559AA9YXDv	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	How do I make my "sweet tea" healthier? I drink sweet tea (w/sugar) everyday but want other ways to sweeten?	I am fueling my body with sugar every day by drinking so much sugar through my tea, but because I try to eat naturally and in a healthy way, I want to avoid Splenda/Equal/Sweet&Low. Honey has a lot of sugar too and Stevia/Truvia leave a strange after taste... Whats next? How do I enjoy my sweet tea without lots of calories (weight gain) or sugar (bad for your body in large amounts) ?? I am very excited to hear suggestions from others! Thanks!

They are studying the 1930's and have to do this project where they have 3.75 (US dollars) to feed a six-person family.  The money varies according to the amount of people but this is for ours.  The people in the family actually have to eat it and you cannot use any packaged foods, food mixes, frozen foods, chips, etc. (for example no frozen green beans, mac & cheese, instant rice).  You are allowed to use canned fruits and veggies but no more than 2 cans.      Anyone have any ideas?

20090226140314AAfuZiA	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Bread machine crust select is broken, How can I soften the crust without it?	Bread comes out looking beautiful though darker brown than my other machine.  It is also tough to eat and some bites taste burnt.  No one in my house will eat the crust at all.  I got this machine from the good will and it is otherwise very nice.  It is a Breadman I love the buttons and screen, it goes up to 2.5lb, it is nice looking, and quiet, it is all great for my 14.99, but I think it needs to go back.  A couple months ago I went and looked and they had 10 bread machines, this time I went knowing more about them ( I have been borrowing one and reading a lot of reviews and bread machine books) and there was only 2.  The other there was not what I wanted at all.  What do you think?  Can I soften the crust?  Also tell me, this machine is terrible to get the loaf out is that to do with the hard crust?  MY other machine which makes a vertical loaf where this one looks like a mini loaf of store bread, as I was saying my borrowed machine (10yrs old) I shake the pan 3-5 times and out pops the loaf.  This Breadman is horrible!  I try rubber spatulas plastic spoons my husband tried a butter knife when I wasn't looking. I had to grip with my hands and barely got it out with out tearing it in two

20090226150555AA1AvKK	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Help with green chicken recipe?	I think it was a south beach recipe but I'm not sure.  It has green onions and jalapenos and garlic blended to almost liquid and you pour it over chicken and bake it or grill it.  Anyway, the chicken ends up being green because of the green onion and jalapenos.  I can not find the recipe any where and I want to make it for dinner for my parents.  If you can find anything even close to what I'm looking for that would be ok too.  It's not enchiladas or chili.  It may have been a kabob recipe though.  Thank you so much for the help!
