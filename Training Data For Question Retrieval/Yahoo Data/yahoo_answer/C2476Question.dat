20090308030441AAjjcoV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Yet another poem requiring review. This is the opening poem for a novel I am attempting.?	The Tale      Here now comes a tale often told   Of the greatest rebellion known.   Led by a Seraph, none more bold   Than he who sought that regal crown.      With allies and opponents,   And neutral beings, plenty   Let us gather these events   And learn from what we see.      Shattered peace, war unending   Heaven suffered Hell’s fight   ‘Til Heaven’s host defending   Threw down the demonic blight.      Straightway the rebels fell down   To the abysmal, fiery lands   Where in despair they did drown   ‘Til raised by defiant commands.      Now they sit and plot revenge   ‘Gainst His newest of creations,   And for their shattered dreams they will avenge,   And seek their own emancipations.

I liked Harry Potter quite a bit. I also like the Hitchhiker's series very, very much.       However, I'm really too much into 'traditional' fantasy. The Mercedes Lackey/Tamora Pierce style of long winded fantasy kinda got to me.      I'm not a big mystery/romance person either. Some of those elements are fine, but when its the focus, I get turned off.

20090308031742AAx78Vf	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How do i structure a piece on 4 poems from the AQA anthology?	My teacher is asking us to do essay on weekends to prepare for our exam in May The question is:       "Compare how the parent and child relationships are presented in Catrin, Digging, The Song of the old Mother and On my first Sonne"      I know how to talk about the lauguage and stanza's and rhyme scheme etc. But how would i structure a piece like this were it says compare the 4 poems. Should i talk about each one individually and then have one paragraph to compare them or do i compare them throught the text in each paragraph and if so how?       Also when you have a question like this are you supposed to include references to Writing style, structure, effectiveness and content. Because since the question is asking how parent and child relationships are presented i would just make references to stanzas and language not style.      Is that correct how can i structure it to get the best mark possible?

20090308032153AA3zg5q	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my novel?	hi there im working on a superhero book as a side project to my main but its not ur average run of the mill nice guy hero hows it sound to start off thanks all ,ps theres probably typos and grammer just want to know how its sounds and what you think thanks all    by cameron johnson - High voltage         The city was quiet, almost peaceful. But silence was overrated. Something John Michaels knew all to well. As he stared into the quite still water illuminated by the presence of the full moon, he caught a glimpse of his reflection.  His former self and identity he would no longer cling to. His thick brown hair, eyes to match and even his five o’clock shadow. It all now meant nothing. No one would ever gaze upon his true face again. His medium build and height would be all that would link him to them. Human he was no longer. He looked human but inside was different. Not his organs or muscles but his feelings. He was now an outsider a freak, he felt, alone. John’s eyes left the water and gazed at his hands that he held shaking in front of him. Hands of a killer covered in the blood of his victim. This blood that now stained his hands was the first of many stains to come. Of this fact John had come to realize. He had gained control of the power gifted to him and he now knew his purpose. He now realized his destiny was unlike any other being who walked this earth. John would now become a hero…      Once his mind was cleared and his trench coat tied up he stuffed his hands in his pockets and strolled slowly away from the river. His mind was racing, thoughts flooding every part of his conscience. “What would he wear”? , “Where would he go”? ,  “Was what he was doing right or wrong”? . The answers he didn’t have but he would need them fast of this he was sure. As he continued walking home he realized that any form of costume was out of the question. He needed to blend in but also needed a mark to be feared by. A name was something of importance; all great heroes had names. This all came to mind but really in this cold-hearted city where nobody cared for anyone but himself or herself was there any need for a hero. What’s the point of saving the lost? John knew though in his heart that he was given a gift and that he had to use it no matter what.

Problem:  I rent, so I cannot have a permanent installation.  AND I have popcorn ceilings, the kind that look like cottage cheese.

20090308040452AATSJ5G	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need tips and advices...first novel..?	this is HALF of the first chapter...      1. Dream   I was doing my best to run, trying to make my feet move. Don’t stop! You need to keep running! I told myself. But my feet were starting to feel heavy, my hands trembling from the unknown danger and my head suffering from great pain. My body was getting tired, but still, I couldn’t stop. I let my eyes looked ahead of me, searching for someone that might be dragging me away. A dark form, a human’s behind. My head was hurting from all the visions. I did not want to scream but the pain was so powerful. What is going on? I questioned. Nothing was making any sense, figures after figures but none of them was clear. Then I felt my feet give up, I was lying on the floor, helpless. I gathered my courage and tried to look back, a man’s form was there.      I woke up in cold sweat, my head throbbing.      It was dark around me, it further my anxiety. It was then that I grasped the fact it was still nighttime. The night was so still, not a sound of a cricket, just the irritating tick-tocks’ from my wall clock. I sat up, clutching on my warm quilt. The chilly wind gushing through my window touched my skin, making me shivered. I, once again, heard my dog’s––Puppy––disturbing snarls. It has been days since I started waking up this late at night and for some reason, minutes later Puppy would always starts growling, though I’ve always decided to ignore it. My head thuds too much to pay attention.      “It was just a dream. It was just a dream.” I sighed.      Everything felt so real. The only difference was that I was a third person, watching myself from afar.    I was like an audience in a theatrical production––more like a horror genre production––where nothing was visible but the actor on stage alone, and the untainted darkness covering the entire building. Trying to remember how it felt just made me feel woozy.       I persuaded myself to sleep but my eyelids wouldn’t even dare to close. Every time I try to, the dream would just haunt me.      The sun wasn’t still rising when I decided to go down to the kitchen. Grab a drink or just have a midnight snack. I needed a distraction––seriously. The darkness in the hallway was blinding; I let my fingers traced the wall, searching for the switch. I stumbled quite a few times before I found it. I’m not really a klutz; it’s just that my feet weren’t cooperating.      I got down stairs and grabbed a glass of water. My hands were still quivering, spilling drops of water on the floor. I took a towel on one hand, clutched my fingers together––to cease the shaking––and got on my knees to wipe the drops.      My mind began wandering of, thinking of the things I dreamt, although it was all silhouettes, nothing was clear. Thinking about it makes my head ache. I sat down––tired from kneeling––on the cold marble tiles, laid my head back on our wooden back door, tightened my eyes and tried to relaxed. I took in some hard gasps and then finally stood up.       “Come on, Mel. You know better than torturing yourself about some strange dream.” I calmed myself. “Also, it’s not like this was the first time you ever dreamt something strange.” I convinced. “You’ve actually dreamt about that guy last week, too.” I was stunned by my conclusion; my eyes opened wide. “That’s right. That’s why it felt like déjà vu.” I said; my voice flat.      There was a young man, dazzled or maybe staring at something. Or was he staring at me? Dazzled about me? Why would he be? Nothing’s special about me.      But what does he looks like?      “Oh!” I remembered. I grabbed a piece of paper and a marker, and began drawing the figures popping into my head.      His body looked kind of tall and slender, his face was oval and his hair had a brilliant shaggy cut. I couldn’t really see his expression because of the darkness. It was all silhouettes and shadows, though I think he was wearing a gray bulky jacket, dark colored shirt and a pair of denims. He wasn’t really doing anything, just standing motionless.      I kept on drawing him until the finished product was right in front of me. It was mostly just shades and outlines. Nothing crucial.      Who is he? I wondered.      I examined his form, and was mesmerized by his muscular figure; trying to make him fit with one of my classmates.      No one fits.       He’s beauty’s aura was just more striking and fascinating than anyone I’ve ever known.   I frowned at myself. I wasn’t making any progress. But wait! What do you need progress for? Just to say you know him? Then after that, what? I started to question myself. He might even be just a dream, just some kind of arbitrary figure and shape.      It was true; though it might sound rather crazy but I was––as far as I believed––able to see the future or more like visions of what might happen in the near future. Nothing clear, just weird structure and figures, mostly human’s––human beings that I might encounter eventually.      I was still a kid back then; mischievous and intolerant like any others. We used to live with

FLANNAN ISLE              by: Wilfrid Wilson Gibson                  THOUGH three men dwell on Flannan Isle               To keep the lamp alight,               As we steer'd under the lee, we caught               No glimmer through the night!                               A passing ship at dawn had brought               The news; and quickly we set sail,               To find out what strange thing might all               The keepers of the deep-sea light.                               The winter day broke blue and bright,               With glancing sun and glancing spray,               As o'er the swell our boat made way,               As gallant as a gull in flight.                               But, as we near'd the lonely Isle;               And look'd up at the naked height;               And saw the lighthouse towering white,               With blinded lantern, that all night               Had never shot a spark               Of comfort through the dark,               So ghastly in the cold sunlight               It seem'd, that we were struck the while               With wonder all too dread for words.                               And, as into the tiny creek               We stole beneath the hanging crag,               We saw three queer, black, ugly birds--               Too big, by far, in my belief,               For guillemot or shag--               Like seamen sitting bold upright               Upon a half-tide reef:               But, as we near'd, they plunged from sight,               Without a sound, or spurt of white.                               And still too mazed to speak,               We landed; and made fast the boat;               And climb'd the track in single file,               Each wishing he was safe afloat,               On any sea, however far,               So it be far from Flannan Isle:               And still we seem'd to climb, and climb,               As though we'd lost all count of time,               And so must climb for evermore.               Yet, all too soon, we reached the door--               The black, sun-blister'd lighthouse door,               That gaped for us ajar.                               As, on the threshold, for a spell,               We paused, we seem'd to breathe the smell               Of limewash and of tar,               Familiar as our daily breath,               As though 'twere some strange scent of death:               And so, yet wondering, side by side,               We stood a moment, still tongue-tied:               And each with black foreboding eyed               The door, ere we should fling it wide,               To leave the sunlight for the gloom:               Till, plucking courage up, at last,               Hard on each other's heels we pass'd               Into the living-room.                               Yet, as we crowded through the door,               We only saw a table, spread               For dinner, meat and cheese and bread;               But all untouch'd; and no one there:               As though, when they sat down to eat,               Ere they could even taste,               Alarm had come; and they in haste               Had risen and left the bread and meat:               For on the table-head a chair               Lay tumbled on the floor.               We listen'd; but we only heard               The feeble cheeping of a bird               That starved upon its perch:               And, listening still, without a word,               We set about our hopeless search.                               We hunted high, we hunted low,               And soon ransack'd the empty house;               Then o'er the Island, to and fro,               We ranged, to listen and to look               In every cranny, cleft or nook               That might have hid a bird or mouse:               But, though we searched from shore to shore,               We found no sign in any place:               And soon again stood face to face               Before the gaping door:               And stole into the room once more               As frighten'd children steal.                               Aye: though we hunted high and low,               And hunted everywhere,               Of the three men's fate we found no trace               Of any kind in any place,               But a door ajar, and an untouch'd meal,               And an overtoppled chair.                               And, as we listen'd in the gloom               Of that forsaken living-room--               O chill clutch on our breath--               We thought how ill-chance came to all               Who kept the Flannan Light:               And how the rock had been the death               Of many a likely lad:               How six had come to a sudden end               And three had gone stark mad:               And one whom we'd all known as friend               Had leapt from the lantern one still night,               And fallen dead by the lighthouse wall:               And long we thought               On the three we sought,               And of what migh

20090307180859AA6UVCe	Arts & Humanities;History	Is this right? Did Americans make the first move for Pearl Harbor by shooting down a Japanese Midget Submarine?	Or was it the Japanese?      I hope you know your history.       As for the United States, when it was still dark in Hawaii, 5 Japanese Submarine let go 1 midget submarine, where there were 5 i think, and those Japanese midget submarines were supposed to go help out once the Japanese Zeros and stuff attacked, but one sub had trouble with its thing where you use to see in the water and stuff, so the Japanese midget sub went up into the water, a US destroyer or ship fired and missed once or twice, then no action was taken to alert the US.      this is just the first part. There are more. but thats all I am saying. The US made the first move, they eventually sunk the midget submarine, and the midget submarine was never found I think. But 1 or 2 of the people in one of the Japanese submarine were captured before they could kill themselves.       I'm trying to prove some people wrong.      I watched the fricken history channel      The search for the lost Midget submarine, it was with that guy who found the titanic or whatever

Its taken somewhat out of context, so I'm looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. The "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name or develop. Any constructive crit is appreciated. Also, the word family here means a strong group of friends.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "I missed you- alot. For some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. Heh. I often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   I found myself looking down. I was embarrassed by what I said. I sounded like such a loser and so desperate. I was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "I did think of you. I thought I was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...Ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   I went blank. All i could do now was stare through her in amazement. I found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "Thank you", she said.   "For what?"   "For missing me."   I let out a breath of a laugh."Why wouldn't i miss you?"   "Why would you?"   "I love you", As i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   I knew I had to say something. I couldn't help what I just said. I had to change this moment. I had to make something out of this. I had to recover from this mistake.   "I hope that didn't come out too cheesy. I spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "Hey..stop talking". She cut me off. I was ready for a verbal lashing. I felt terrible and sick. After all she went through, I should be aware of her feelings. It was so obvious. What was I thinking. Was i thinking? These Thoughts raced through my head so fast that I COULDN'T think. I attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "I love you too."   I felt like i went dead.

I have to do an english project called the American Portfolio that entails researching how a specific subject has significantly influenced America (or is still affecting America).   My topic is the modeling industry and i am examining the positive and negative sides of the industry...the positive being that it inspires young girls to be fit and have confidence, and it aids the American economy.   The negative side is that it causes health disorders like anorexia, bulimia, and low self esteem because of the "perfect woman" image ideal.      For a specific part of the project, I need to create original artwork that portrays my subject. I can make anything I want, it just has to be original and I have to make it within a day.

20090308054822AAIXIcN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do these character seem engaging?	i just wanted to know if my two character for the book i'm writing seem interesting       first of all there is Mordred, a loner and a rebel. Strong, arrogant and full of hate but inside he is still bleeding from his mothers suicide and his fathers abuse. Only in his teens but acts like his older.  A teenage delinquent with long greasy black hair, dirty band t-shits and ill fitting jean. they type of guy who you would expect to go around on his skateboard listening to heavy metal. hes kind of mysterious and doesn't talk much but hes very moody and would probably punch you in the face if you pissed him off. He came from a rich family but ran away. He is surprisingly intelligent but never tries harder than he has to. he's also sly. Charming when he wants to be and is a smooth talker ( when he talks). He finds it hard to make friends but easy to make enemys.      the second is Winter. Shes sharp and intelligent girl but constantly underestimates her self. Shes a bit of a push over and fades into the shadows when someone else takes the spotlight. She seems to have a  lot of friends but isn't really close to any. On the outside she is sweet and slightly to innocent but on the inside she is screaming with pent up hate and anger. Shes usually very calm but can get fiery. She is a orphan who lives with a foster family who she knows is only in it for the government money and her trust fund while Mordred also lives with a foster father but is happy with him. She, like Mordred, likes alternative music. Shes not the bravest person in the world but has strong morals and principals which she holds on to until the end. She is one of those types of people who are funny without meaning to be and loves nothing more than a good joke. Both character are very creative.

20090227141128AAuqWBs	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	In the Twilight Saga...?	Why is Alice, Edward, Esme, Emmett and Carlisle's surname Cullen, but Rosalie and Jasper's surname is Hale (if I remember correctly - its been a while since I read the series).   They're all adopted, so I would've thought that they would all be different or all have changed their surname to Cullen because they are Carlisle and Esme's 'sons and daughters'.      So Esme and Carlisle are married making their surname Cullen.   But what about the rest?

20090227140125AAjgPL2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Are there any good vampire books besides Twilight?	Well I was reading Laurell K Hamilton, and from what I heard I don't think I want to continue it. Maybe later, but I'm getting bored with how she writes and explains things. I'm just getting tired of the sarcastic Anita, and I'd like more of something more interesting with all the action and sex.    I'm not really talking about a romance book where its just real annoying rather than romantic. Some sort of book that draws the reader in, and has a well built characters and such.   Any suggestions would be great! And don't suggest books like Twilight I'm not interested in reading it.   Could you also give me a description of what its about as well as the author and title of the book. Thanks so much.

20090308012326AAIVxqI	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Please Read my speech?	What do you think about my speech? If you start to hate it and stop reading, read the edit post at the bottom!      Really think about what it is I am actually saying! What I say may upset even offend some of you, but think about the true meaning!         Intro:   I. If you think gay people should be allowed to get married, please identify yourself by raising your hand. Really?    Gays should be allowed to get married?    Gay people are the same as straight people?    Gays have feelings too?    Gay rights?       II. I do not believe in this gay rights “issue”, and with this time I will do my best to persuade you to agree with me that gays should not be allowed to get married. Not only that, but that they are an abomination, have no rights, and are worthy of death.    B. How will I do that you ask? Through an organized structure. You will see the light and I will guide you.      Trans:    I. Good questions lead to good answers and create more good questions.   The right questions in the right order should lead to the right conclusion.   Phoney facts, phoney laws, and phoney theories will surface.   A. A quote/poem I wrote   II. How many of you are part of an organized religion?   How well do you know your religion?   How many of you believe in God?   How many of you have read the Bible?   Body:    I. Whenever there is an issue of controversy, I like to consult the Bible. For the Bible is my source.   A. Quote: “This is the word of God. There is no other word of God, and we live die sink and swim on this book.” Reverend Jimmy Swaggert    F. Proving its credibility.    B. The body is not for fornication. It was not made for this, but for a nobler purpose--for the Lord. Hence, sensuality cannot be thus justified. The grievousness of the sin is in the desecration to such an unholy purpose of a body which has become a member of Christ, a part of the temple of God. Corinthians 6:13, 18   C. Clearly God does not want us to engage in sexual activities. This is explicitly stated in the Bible.    E. Remember when that one guy was getting it on with his wife, and since we all know that if you don’t want to get her pregnant, then you pull out, he did. Once his seed hit the ground, God struck him dead.   D. The only purpose of sexual intercourse is to produce offspring after marriage.         Trans:    I. What is marriage? Why is there such a thing? What purpose does it serve?   A. For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh. And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed. Genesis 2:24-25   B. As we can clearly see, this is metaphoring marriage. Which implies not only companionship, but intimacy as well.   C. Thou shall not lie with a man as with a woman; It is an abomination    i. Leviticus 18:22   a. If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them.   1. Leviticus 20:13   D. This implies that a marriage is strictly between a man and a woman.       Visual:   I. YouTube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQHnSHK9X...          Conclusion:    I. These are not just my words, but also the words of God.    A. In conclusion, you can either agree with me that gay people should not be allowed to get married, that they are an abomination, and have no rights, or you can disagree with God.   i. I simplified the issue for you.   B. I mean, to disagree with God is like saying that the Bible is a sick intolerant fairytale.   i. Which we all know is not the case!   C. We need to unite, the youth need to step up, and we need to preach the word of God.   D. Homosexuality is not acceptable; God is not tolerant of homosexuals; homosexuals are worthy of death.   E. I don’t even know why this is even an issue?   F. It’s immoral! The highest power says so. God almighty himself.         to spell it out, people are inappropriately using the Bible to preach intolerance and hate! I am pro gay rights. This is a speech.
20090308060849AAEepFC	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this writing?	I was just 'warming-up', ready to write some more of my book, and I wrote this. what do you think of it?         At the end of Thunderstorm Avenue there was a forest. The village children were all afraid to go in, their parents had always forbidden them to go near it. No-one had gone in there for years, not even the adults. Legend has it, that anyone who went in, never came out. ‘How cliché,’ she thought. But she wasn’t scared to go in. She’d do it.       She stood shifting her weight from foot to foot, contemplating her next move. She could easily go back, and not enter the opening of the ominous, black woods. But then again, woods can’t take people, only people could. And no-one went in there. She’d be fine.       As she went to take her first brave step into the trees, her small phone rang. The display said ‘unknown caller’.      ‘Hello?’   She was greeted with an eerie silence on the end of the line.     ‘Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?’     ‘Don’t go in there.’     ‘What?’     ‘I said, don’t go in there. People don’t go in there. Don’t.’   She stood rooted to the spot, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. How did the caller know what she was about to do.     ‘Who is this?’     ‘No-one.’   She took a step forwards and the caller on the phone cried out.     ‘NO! WHAT DID I SAY!’     ‘Who are you. You can’t tell me what to do and not even tell me who you are, or how the hell you know what I’m doing!’ she shot back, her eyes swimming in tears.   The phone went silent for a moment, and the boiling hot tears that had been brewing in her eyes spilled over, creating an intricate web of rivulets on her pale cheeks.         Comments and Critisism appreciated :)      Thanks in advance! x

20090308052225AAXQ5pl	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What would you choose?	I am making a Fantasy-story with Light, Darkness & Twilight within it. It's about a boy who lost his parents, his name is Zero. But in truth he is The Chosen Hero. He has a legendary weapon (Looks like the Aerial Blades wielded by Xemnas in Kingdom Hearts 2 or the lances wielded by Shanao in Castlevania Order Of Ecclesia). With this he protects the worlds against evil. But in one point of the story he sacrifies himself for his best friend, a girl named Dawn. He's falling into Darkness but because of his strong heart and all the power hide in it, it's finally about to awaken, he'll be neither or Light or Darkness, thus Twilight. He fights villains from Light and Darkness and his biggest opponents are The God Of Darkness & The Goddess Of Light.      So that is kinda the story. But I need a name for the story. Because of the Twilight serie from Stephanie Meyers I can't use the title Twilight. Here are some examples for the title (I like also title with 1 or 2 words) :   - Into the Twilight   - Between Light & Darkness   - Between Dawn & Dusk   - (From) Dawn to Dusk   - Beyond Dawn & Dusk   - Beyond Light & Darkness   - Beyond Twilight   - (From) Light to Darkness   - (Something else, like.........., I would also like a title with 1 or 2 words)      * I doesn't know a name for the weapon either so maybe you've got an idea, I thought of "Enerblade" but you can also choose own ideas.      I would like Latin or Greek words for the name of the title/weapon also.      And maybe you know a better way to let awaken the Twilight powers from Zero, I fought this way is a little bit stupid. All ideas are welcome.      And I'm sorry if grammar is that worse, I had got some reactions about that.   Thanks ^.^

20090308010252AAzQCcM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Who is better, Richard III or Aaron?	In Shakespeare's plays, there are plenty of evil villans. My friends are constantly rooting for Aaron (from Titus Andronics), and I do love him. I think he is amazing, but I do think Richard III is better. They are both very manipulative, but Richard can do so much more without getting his hands dirty. Aaron is awesome and kills a lot of people, but Richard is able to manipulate people into doing what he wants, and even when people find out what he is doing (i.e. the women) they can't stop him.      Everyone says that Richard had a weakness, and that was that he eventually had a conscious, but Aaron gave up for a baby. In the end, they both died.      So, even though I love Aaron, I've gotta go for Richard III.      Who do you think? Aaron, or Richard III?

20090308013624AAeFhd5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I read a book which had a character who was a young girl that was a sociopath of sorts. What was the title?	I read the book in probably 2005. And it was probably about 2 or 3 years old AT LEAST.      The book is about a young girl, I think preteen, who is a sociopath. The book begins, I think with the main character, who was this girl's best friend as a child, interrogating her, and I think he has held her hostage. And the entirety of the book is told through like his memories, or her flashbacks or something.       In the book, there is a big quarry which is really important, and the girl character used to keep these "journals" which she wrote in in a secret code -- that the narrator later is able to decode. The girl also had a baby brother (maybe sister) who she kills in his sleep by smothering him.      I remember I absolutely adored the twisted nature of the book, and I would like to read it again, but I cannot for the life of me, remember what it was called.      I think her name was Sophie, but don't quote me on that and I believe the author was male, but once again, if you think you know this book, please don't not post because the main character's name isn't Sophie and it was written by a girl.

Hey,     I heard about a piece of artwork which I think is stationed in Bavaria Germany, perhaps specifically Bayern Munich, not really sure though.  Any how its a shotgun pointing forward with a timer facing backward away from the viewing position so its not visible when its going to go off.  People pay to sit in front of it for 15 minutes and its supposed to go off sometime in the next fifty years.  I'm interested and so have spent awhile trying to research it, look it up on the internet, but have been unsuccesful finding anything about it or anything related.  So if there's any chance anyone could find out something about it, maybe give me a link to a webpage or just the name of the piece that would be great!!!   Thanks   Sasha    :p

Tell me if you like this, and if you think you figured out the story behind it      KNIFE               Wounded, almost lifeless   I lie here on the floor   Clutching at the knife   The pain I do abhor      The rough and jagged edges   Scar and tear my heart   Leaving holes and shredded ribbons   Tearing still apart      Dizzy, uncomprehending    Nothing's making sense   The rock that held me up   Yanked away with no pretense      Instead of bliss forever   Sorrow creeps and lurks   Morbid depression lying   In a heart that’s scarred and hurt      The knife has quickly taken   Over every feeling   I cannot eat nor sleep nor breathe   Only lie in pain, still reeling      From the sudden quick attack   That left me gasping, choking on   Tears that kept on streaming   From the insanity of it all      Now pain is quickly spreading   From my heart throughout my veins   Consuming every thought   Controlling my very brain      Searing, scorching hurt   Like flames take over life   No longer can I stand   I for sure shall lose this fight      Pain corrupts my vision   Making everything a blur   Yet one thing sharp and clear   The root, pain's very core      The thrower of knife   He who cast this hurt to me   Could stop it all right now   Yet he’d rather watch me scream      There is nothing I can do   But wait and endless wait   Hoping against hope   He shall come and change my fate      Only He can take the knife   Pull it from my chest   Yet he waits and leaves me helpless   He thinks its for the best      I can’t stand this hurt, this pain   This sorrow, this depression   It is made all the worse   By my self’s own concession      The wound is growing bigger   Nothing stops this trial   A last sob echoes out   And I lie here in denial      My frail self has crumbled   Lying broken I feel so numb   I’m beyond the pain that’s raging   Waiting for my end to come      I’m growing paler every second   I’m wishing for an end   Whether it be by Him returning   Or by deaths final grip instead

A fluid hand of art, to sculpt and craft   The structures formed in verses, written lines   Engraved on paper; charily, with graft   The rims and knobs, they chisel to refine      A drifting mind; ambling in places, times    Arousing thoughts; the beats and flow cohere   With coloured words, they brush and daub to rhyme;   The pen adopt their words- as they appear      A fecund soul, kindled from passion- zest    The ink of life, disperse into dry hearts   Incite emotions; buried, in the chest    Revoke images- yields of worded art      A gifted artisan of words- a proof of skin   The seeds and grains of wisdom; sowed within      Opinions?

I don't have any idea what it is called because it is at the beginning like a prelude but it happens during the novel.        Please tell me what it is and input your opinions.            I was running from something that I did not recall seeing before and hour ago.  Loud growling sounds escaped its mouth as we ran through thick trees and brush.       The stars twinkled down upon us and their innocence filled me with rage.  How could they watch when I was being hunted?      i would think their beauty would fade out of my mind in a situation like this.       "Alem," I whispered hoping my guardian would hear my plea. My legs were stinging because of all the twigs brushing against them. I kept telling myself to keep running, just on more stride.      Just one more stride after another.

20090308064345AAEiePj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good essay for the Grapes of Wrath?	Viewing the Grapes of Wrath as a novel that equally presents two very conflicting ideologies is quite of an impressive way to interpret the novel. The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, steers the reader through the lives of a destitute family that embarks on a journey towards California, facing obstacles along the way. The novel represents two main contrasting, yet equally represented dogmas: Transcendentalism and Naturalism. Transcendentalism, which is the employment of religious ideologies based on philosophy that emphasizes the spiritual and intuitive, is evident as the family is accompanied by a former preacher who shares religious beliefs. Naturalism, which is the employment of grotesque and horrid scenes in books, is evident as the family travels towards California. Both Transcendentalism and Naturalism share the dominant ideology within the book as Steinbeck blends these two contradictions into a story.           It is ironic that Steinbeck even chooses to induct such a pessimistic theme, like Naturalism, on characters that mainly base their futures on hopes and dreams. For instance, the motif of hope is prevalent through the novel as a character optimizes about the family’s future “” This exemplifies the extent to which Steinbeck depicts the theme of Naturalism in Grapes of Wrath. Yes, the definition of Naturalism is certainly that human destiny is determined by congruity and environment, but Naturalism is also defined by a high pessimism in the sense that dreams never come true. Therefore, the intent and idea of naturalism is certainly evident if using the definition of human destiny. However, the actual occurrence of events due to influence of Naturalism like the entire Joad family hoping for work is catastrophic to the novel.           The Grapes of Wrath begins with the protagonists, the Joad family, in search of a better life because nature and society, as well as corporate power, has driven the family off their land and left them in an unfortunate state. As the Joad’s had no place to go, they decided to move out west because of a mere handbill that advertised for jobs. Like the rest of the tens-of-thousands of poor people looking for a job that only took in a couple hundred, the Joad’s set out on a journey towards California. Now, as the Joad’s left their home in Oklahoma, they left as a family that was very cloistered from the rest of the world. The Joad’s had very little experience with the rest of the world and were a quite “plain” family. As they progress towards California, facing many problems in between, they tend to evolve and become more aware of the issues surrounding them and even prescience that life in California may be just a mere illusion.

20090308075300AAr1mtN	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can anybody explain this metaphor found in Margaret Atwood's poem "The Immigrants"?	Here is the poem:      The Immigrants by Margaret Atwood      They are allowed to inherit   the sidewalks involved as palmlines, bricks   exhausted and soft, the deep   lawnsmells, orchards whorled   to the land’s contours, the inflected weather      only to be told they are too poor   to keep it up, or someone   has noticed and wants to kill them; or the towns   pass laws which declare them obsolete.      I see them coming   up from the hold smelling of vomit,   infested, emaciated, their skins grey   with travel; as they step on shore      the old countries recede, become   perfect, thumbnail castles preserved   like gallstones in a glass bottle, the    towns dwindle upon the hillsides   in a light paperweight-clear.      They carry their carpetbags and trunks   with clothes, dishes, the family pictures;   they think they will make an order   like the old one, sow miniature orchards,   carve children and flocks out of wood      but always they are too poor, the sky   is flat, the green fruit shrivels   in the prairie sun, wood is for burning;   and if they go back, the towns      in time have crumbled, their tongues   stumble among awkward teeth, their ears   are filled with the sound of breaking glass.   I wish I could forget them   and so forget myself:      my mind is a wide pink map   across which move year after year   arrows and dotted lines, further and further,   people in railway cars      their heads stuck out of the windows   at stations, drinking milk or singing,   their features hidden with beards or shawls   day and night riding across an ocean of unknown   land to an unknown land.         I was wondering if anybody could help me understand the metaphor "my mind is a wide pink map"... why is Atwood comparing her mind to a map? Any help is appreciated! Thanks!

My dream is to become a successful author, so what universities/colleges would be best for me to attend?   The school would have to be in the united states and preferably in NJ, NY, PA, VA, CT like the northeastern area, but I'm not picky. If there is an AMAZING school say in california, let me know about it.      Does anyone know if the writing major in Seton Hill University is great? I want to go to a place that has one of the best programs/majors, not just any random school that just has writing but it isnt that great, you know?      please help (:

20090308082324AA2e63V	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I need help analyzing this poem.?	i would like to know the meaning of this poem      He listened at the porch that day,   To hear the wheel go on, and on;   And then it stopped, ran back away,   While through the door he brought the sun:   But now my spinning is all done.         He sat beside me, with an oath   That love ne'er ended, once begun;   I smiled--believing for us both,   What was the truth for only one:   And now my spinning is all done.         My mother cursed me that I heard   A young man's wooing as I spun:   Thanks, cruel mother, for that word--   For I have, since, a harder known!   And now my spinning is all done.         I thought--O God!--my first-born's cry   Both voices to mine ear would drown:   I listened in mine agony--   It was the silence made me groan!   And now my spinning is all done.         Bury me 'twixt my mother's grave,   (Who cursed me on her death-bed lone)   And my dead baby's (God it save!)   Who, not to bless me, would not moan.   And now my spinning is all done.         A stone upon my heart and head,   But no name written on the stone!   Sweet neighbours, whisper low instead,   "This sinner was a loving one--   And now her spinning is all done."         And let the door ajar remain,   In case he should pass by anon;   And leave the wheel out very plain,--   That HE, when passing in the sun,   May see the spinning is all done.

20090308083741AAaK1mC	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you keep on Reading?	Prologue      The Beginning         It was hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk, but too hot for anybody to stay and watch. Everyone stayed in the cool comfort of their homes. Listless branches hung to the ground too tired to dance with the wind. Even the wind was exhausted, too worn out to even cool the heat, it just pushed the hot air around. It was the kind of day in which one should sit directly in front of a fan, or better yet an air conditioner, with a book and some ice cold lemonade. Definitely not a day for strenuous activity. Most definitely not a day for running, unless of course you wished to pass out from heat exertion.      Had someone, tired of reading about the boy who lived, had happened to look out their window, they would have been surprised to see someone running. If it had been your mom, she would have tisked and stated that someone had ought to know better. She would have wondered where was that poor child's mother, and she would have yelled after the girl to stop!      The girl ran on but she was tired and hot. Sweat matted her curls down and the effort had made her round cheeks red and her breath come out in rasping gasps. She had come such a long way already, at a pace that suggested her life depended on it, which it very well did. The Torments were fast approaching.      Torments were ugly and malicious little creatures. Their ears were almost as big as they were, and hairy to boot. They had skinny knobby bodies covered in patches of long smelly hair, and although they were only about twenty inches high they were quite fierce. Once set loose they would not stop till they had their prey, and they had but to touch them. Their touch caused such tremendous mental anguish that they need no rope to bind with.      Reluctantly, the girl stopped and leaned up against a solid oak to catch her breath. The sound of nearby twigs snapping urged her forward, so she brushed the sweaty curls from her brow and continued to run. The Torments were gaining. All they could think of was the girl and they raced after her never losing her from their sight. She could feel the yellow eyes boring into her back. Sweat poured down her temples, and her side ached and begged her to stop but still she ran. She had to. She had stolen the First Book and there was no turning back now. The book clutched to her chest didn’t look like anything special. It was bound in age mottled leather and was rather worn but she held it like something precious.      Ahead of her loomed the Hairy Forest, the most dangerous place in REM, but the girl ran in without a second thought. She had to get away from the Torments. She had to find a safe haven for the book.      In her haste she never noticed the glowing. Everly just ran right through the yellow, blue and green swirling vortex of light that had suddenly opened ahead of her. If she had seen it, she probably would’ve gone around it to some other adventure, but that would make this a very different story. In fact there might not be any story at all, except that she did see it.      The sudden quiet made her realize she was suddenly alone. Nausea rumbled in her belly as the tumbling sensation hit. Everly was falling and it seemed like a very long way down.
