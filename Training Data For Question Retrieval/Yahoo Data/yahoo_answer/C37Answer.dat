wbJXqkVGaa	You shouldnt believe them and here is why. Last year Olmert asked Bush for bunker-busting bombs, & permission to fly over Iraq for an attack on Iran and that request was strongly opposed by Pentagon Robert Gates, who has been retained by Obama & ultimately rejected by Bush. Reasoning: that any attack on Iran risked destabilizing Iraq. While the violence in Iraq has declined, U.S. military insists that stability remains fragile, so that Bush's concerns about the implications for Iraq of a U.S. or Israeli attack on Iran are likely to be shared by Obama. Obama is convinced that Afghanistan & Pakistan which both border Iran, constitute the true "central front in the war on terror." So now they hope to enlist Iran, with which Washington cooperated in ousting the Taliban in 2001, in helping to stabilize Afghanistan.<br>  The importance of Iran has gained strength in just the past few weeks as Washington has scrambled to secure new supply lines into landlocked Afghanistan after a key bridge in Pakistan's Khyber Pass was destroyed by Taliban militants. Taliban were good for something after all;-P<br>  While U.S. efforts to compensate have focused so far on the overland route through Russia and the Central Asian, a growing number of voices have noted that a much less costly and more efficient alternative route would run from Iran's southern ports into western Afghanistan. Why is Russia worse? The deal would be on Russian terms: this means Russia possibly using its own military planes to airlift the supplies, no more NATO extension, no more anti-missile shield in the Czech Republic and Poland for protection against non-existent Iranian missiles.lool<br>  The clear priority stabilizing Southwest Asia is being given by Obama administration and the abrupt change in the rhetoric emanating from Washington about Iran – not to mention abiding concerns regarding Iran's ability to destabilize Iraq – clearly run counter to Israel's efforts to depict Tehran's nuclear program as, in Netanyahu's words, "the greatest challenge facing the leaders of the 21st century..." Obama's plans to enlist Iranian help for coalition efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan - the US's new fronts in the "war on terror" - are likely to strike a particularly sour note in Jerusalem. <br>  I am afraid Netanyahu's War obsession is coming in bad times and does not favor Israel. Let the game begin! looooool|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No, and the parallels are not totally  similar, except for Israeli/ Bush imperialistic policies.

Mf0wH1lRaa	I do not use and would not use marijuana. Beyond the legal implications, I think the use (even short term) of the drug creates too much risk of personality change. I have seen it happen to several people that I know.<br>  <br>  Caveat: I smoke cigars, but only 1 per month at a maximum. Lately, it's been more like 4 per year. I have approximately 3 drinks per week. Mostly beer and wine. <br>  <br>  Marijuana, like tobacco and alcohol, is a psychoactive drug. <br>  <br>  The differences in the drugs are the type of action in the brain, and the long term effects on the body. <br>  <br>  Alcohol is a depressant. Tobacco is a stimulant. Marijuana is both a depressant and a stimulant, as well as a hallucinogen and anti-psychotic. The mish mash effects of the THC in marijuana make it much more dangerous to the brain chemistry than alcohol, but the addictive properties of tobacco, make it similarly dangerous in my evaluation. <br>  <br>  Smokers do not usually have major personality changes caused by their addiction. They are usually addictive personalities in the first place.<br>  <br>  If you smoke marijuana, you do NOT know how it is going to effect you in the short term, or the long term. The effects of alcohol (while bad if consumed in excess) are straightforward and known.<br>  <br>  Additionally, it is possible to measure the amount of alcohol in a drink. It is impossible to know how much THC you are really consuming. <br>  <br>  Tobacco companies have for years tried to hide how much nicotine is in their products in order to avoid legal penalties. Marijuana dealers have for years tried to showcase the strength of their products because the people who use them want to be as intoxicated as possible. Yes, getting HIGH is intoxicating yourself.<br>  <br>  Recent studies show that the carcinogens received by smoking marijuana are stronger than tobacco and alcohol does not compare to the other two. Carcinogen means cancer causing. Intentionally exposing yourself to carcinogens is a very bad idea. See caveat above. Nobody's perfect.<br>  <br>  Scientific studies show that MODERATE alcohol consumption does not appear to be carcinogenic. If you are intoxicated, you are not drinking moderately. <br>  <br>  Alcohol abuse can lead to cancers in the esophagus, intestines, and liver. At the same time, there are some studies showing that moderate red wine consumption can actually increase longevity as well as long term mental function. Smoking both marijuana and cigarettes can lead to any number of cancers, and in a relatively short time. Sure some smokers live to 90, but many are dead by 60.<br>  <br>  Beer and wine are considered to be food products in some cultures. Marijuana has no nutritional value, and contrary to the belief of those who wish to legalize their drug of choice, there are no medical benefits to marijuana which can not be provided in measured doses of prescribed drugs.<br>  <br>  There are enough problems caused in this country by addiction to alcohol and tobacco, I see no reason to make hallucinogens and anti-psychotics generally available. The only way to legally use a hallucinogen in this country is to be a Native American, and use it for entheogenic religious purposes. <br>  <br>  On a political note, I find it peculiar that the same political party that wants to legalize marijuana wants to ban tobacco, and the same that wants to keep tobacco legal wants to keep marijuana illegal. Politics does not always make rational sense.<br>  <br>  I vote no on legalization. It is a strong drug, and comparing it to alcohol doesn't fly. Comparing it to the psychoactive addictive effects of tobacco is more reasonable. It is the governments job to prevent people from hurting each other, and in this case, it should prevent people from selling a harmful narcotic.|`|AA11206283	Too many impaired people in the world now.<br>  <br>  If weed had been publically accepted first, booze would  be illegal.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I agree totally with Mojo's answer.  And Ms. Native Pride.<br>  <br>  Maybe not totally legalize, but let's say decriminalized.  The criminals are making the profits.  The people working in the War Against Drugs could be better utilized elsewhere.  If the governments (local or Federal) were involved, you could possibly track down people who were about to get into trouble and step in, instead of people who are having problems due to the drug (inability to function, etc.).  The criminals selling it to you do not care what happens to you.  There are far too many people sitting in a jail cell right now for having a joint and far too many people on the streets who have committed much more heinous crimes.  The drug testing by employers for weed also bothers me.  You can still test positive after months of non-use, depending on how heavy a user you were.  However, you can come to work still half drunk and that is okay?  The War On Drugs kind of distracts from daily living.<br>  <br>  I also had a husband who suffered from multiple sclerosis and weed has been proven to help with symptoms of his disease and many others.  There are lots of doctors who have advised their patients to attain weed to counter the effects of nausea from chemotherapy.  Glaucoma sufferers also benefit from it and that is the only instance where it is currently medically allowed.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the rant...  just my opinion.|`|gPlUDaRoaa	I think it should legal. It's not like you hear of people smoking a joint & then gets behind the wheel & has an accident & kills someone.But yet you hear how many people are killed each year due to alcohol & driving.                Another one that is becoming more popular is getting all pill-ed up from prescription medicine like benzodiazepines klonopins,lorazepam,and driving and getting into wrecks killing themselves and other people.This past year that happened in my community where 2 young women in different instances drove pill-ed crashed their cars & died,Both women left young kids behind.It is so sad and yet it is happening more & more.But with weed,even when you smoke alot & it's real good you don't get behind the wheel & end up killing yourself or others,In fact i heard people say that when they smoke up & then drive they drive better like they are more aware & alert.I don't smoke weed anymore i quit a year ago when i went into treatment for being addicted to pain pills for 18 yrs.So i decided to quit smoking weed & drinking.It's been tough   but at  the same time it feels so great to feel so good  without needing them pills just to get me through the day.March 18th will be my 1 year anniversary of being clean & sober & i look forward to each & everyday.|`|Q5Nn9Fxoaa	Weed is less harmful than Alcohol and Cigarettes, scientifically proven to NOT be addictive.  It would be a cash crop for the Government, and would drastically reduce the prison overpopulation problem that this country has.  A problem that we all pay for with our taxes.  I could care less weather or not it's "legalized" or even de-criminalized.  I continue to use it for my depression.  I've have grown tired of all the prescription drugs that are made of chemicals that most doctors can not even pronounce.  And have a myriad of side effects that would cripple the most hardcore drug-user.  I don't get "ripped".  I use enough to alter my mood and go on with my life.  I hurt no one in doing so.

If for some reason she wont transfer you there either, you can also ask for the medical records department. Right after this is resolved, you should shred the fax that was sent to you.

For example, the preamble declares one object to be, 'to provide for the common defense.' No one can doubt that this *****does not enlarge the powers of Congress***** to pass**** any measures which they deem useful for the common defence. But suppose the terms of a given power admit of two constructions, the one more restrictive, the other more liberal, and each of them is consistent with the words, but is, and ought to be, governed by the intent of the power; if one could promote and the other defeat the common defence, ought not the former, upon the soundest principles of interpretation, to be adopted?'<br>  '<br>  The Constitution of the United Sates was written for the sole purpose to protect American Citizens.

Gew6pZhbaa	No, considering renewing your tags are a requirement after getting pulled over for having expired ones. If you didn't renew them, and the court found out by checking with the DMV after receiving your ticket, you could get fined again. The only thing you can do is go to court, plead guilty, and request for a smaller fine. Most of the time they'll lower it for you.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	Doubt it will happen. It is the judges decision however. You may also find the fine more costly if you are required to pay it and add court costs.|`|bsIzG62Aaa	I was an animal control officer, when i wrote tickets for no county tags or expired tags for dogs, and the defendant got the tags by the court date, the Atlanta judges would either drop the charge or enforce the fine, it depended on the judge. In the county court and other city courts we wrote tickets for, they enforced the fine.  i have heard from former coworkers that with the budget crisis going on, even ATL judges are enforcing fines.  So, unless you can show that you purchased the renewal before the ticket, looks like you will must likely have to pay the fine.  good luck.

I have run up against real criminals in positions of authority, and as you suggest, uncovering them is really difficult as part of their strategy is cloaking their wrongdoing behind their office.<br>  <br>  You'd think people would be prepared to better judge or at least explore when accusations come from on high, after what we've seen in recent years for Spitzer, and sociopaths of his ilk.  But no.  The usual response is 'A person of standing would never say such a thing unl;ess there was some truth in it.'  <br>  <br>  My recent troubles with this sort of thing involved a three-year legal battle with the clergy of the once-venerable Grace Church in New York, and eventually included the Episcopal Diocese of new York and the Bishop of New York himself. ALL of them could give the Borgias lessons in corruption and insidiousness.  As Jesus said the about Pharisees -- "A den of snakes".<br>  <br>  This sort of thing -- utter disregard for the welfare of others (which is the definition of criminality) flourished during the Bush administration, as our moral precepts became about as socially mature as driving a Hummer.  APPEARANCES and the titles we gave ourselves became much more important than any real propriety, or even decency itself.  .  As a society, we have become close to corruption on the level that infected and killed the society of ancient Rome.  As there, part of our entertainment consists of the watching the condemned being publicly slaughtered, with little regard for Justice.  The last couple of decades of US history have been a disgrace, that's all.

You either trust him completely, dump him, or learn to live with the fact that he may and probably will cheat. Even if he didn't join the Marines, he will always be around other girls. He cheated before and he wasn't even in the Marines. If he is going to cheat then it doesn't matter what job or profession he is in or where he is at. you cannot be with him 24/7.

Here's the story.  I don't think he is going to get into the Marines or any branch of the service.  Because today the economy is so bad that many people are turning towards the military for employment.  As a resutl, all branches of the military have raised their enlistment qualifications.  They want only the best since they now have a larger and wider choice.  A high school diploma is not enough.  Unless he has a provable talent, such as engineering, drawing, physical training, something that he performs exceptional at.  If he has, then he has a shot.  But lets say he does qualify.  Now he enlists for 4 years, goes to Parris Island boot camp for 4 months, and possibly goes to some specialized training for another month, then comes home on leave for a month.  Then probably goes to his permanent duty station. Probably for a year or so.  Or probably goes overseas for a year or so.  Either way,he's going to be away from you for long periods of time.  He's going to get lonely.  And he's going to seek companionship.  That's the way it is.  You're going to get lonely too.  And you're going to seek companionship too.  Why?  Because your letters to him and his letters to you will not do it, that's why.  You now have more information than before you asked your question.  You both have to make some hard decisions.  I am not making any judgments here, just giving you the 'facts of Marine Corps life'.  Good Luck.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	He does not have to join the marines to cheat on you.

MJijF66Paa	It can't work.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the best way to understanding why it won't help is, that even before considering how a trillion dollars being pumped into the economy will affect it, understand what exactly is being pumped into the economy. It would be naive and ignorant to believe that with a $10 trillion dollar national deficit, the government still has a trillion dollars to spend in stimulus packages. The money will actually be made possible by inflation, or the printing of more dollars, and in this case, out of thin air. Inflation lowers the value of the dollar as more and more dollars come into supply, demand of dollars falters. <br>  <br>  So printing a trillion dollars will dramatically depreciate the dollar meaning prices of food, energy, etc. will increase; USD assets will further decline, hurting the equity markets; US businesses will have to leverage more capital via job loss, selling of assets (usually to foreign buyers), etc.. <br>  <br>  Now if you even look at what the stimulus checks are suppose to accomplish, you can also find faults in the actual objectives as well. The stimulus, in hopes, is meant to do three things for the US economy: bring about higher consumer spending, better GDP, and consumer confidence. <br>  <br>  First of all, consumer spending is irrelevant while the trade deficit is still increasing. If consumers are buying imported products, all that is really happening is capital being redirected into foreign economies. <br>  <br>  Second, any increase in GDP will be the result of government debt and not of indication of wealth. You can't take a morgage out, and then assume you're rich. <br>  <br>  And lastly, any confidence asppired by this will be short lived. With inflation and failed attempts to increase consumer spending and GDP, people will have to realize this recession is necessary.<br>  <br>  You can't revive an economy on public debt. Consumer spending and GDP doesn't matter when you're buying imported goods on debt. No wealth is being created, just inflation. Thus making the stimulus a failed policy.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I believe they should have taken that money and divided it up between every household earning less than 200,000 a year. That would stimulate the economy more than anything. It would be enough for families to pay off their mortgages, or I might actually go and buy a home instead of renting. People would have enough to buy new cars, and get out of debt. We are the only ones that can stimulate the economy by spending the money, so we have to have money to spend it. In the end, we (the taxpayers) will decide where that money goes.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Bad.

Thank God because I'm 50.|`|d9672528e10fffc22c5414a30bf28d6baa	If north Americans continue their age-old habits nothing will change in the short run ( couple of years at least). The public has to become sensitive to the natural resource limitations and consider the earth as one world for the common share of all goods and services on a equitable level based on human needs. We have to learn to respect nature and exploit it without causing any harmful effects now and and for any future generations. They say the earth is almost 4.5 billion years old - it has seen many civilizations come and go. How come we have created such a havoc only in the last 50 years? <br>  <br>  If we do not listen to the inner voices of the mother earth and ignore the thunderous warnings of the atmosphere that surround us we will be written in history books like all the other civilizations too.<br>  <br>  Therefore let's take a hold and do all the right things while we still have time to turn the tide in a favorable way by conserving our resources and treating everyone across the world in a humble and humane manner. People in other parts of the world need food, shelter, happiness and carefree life just as much as we do.

The biggest case of all is that socialized medicine (which is what universal health care really is) only works as a rationing of the medical system.

If the government is "monitoring" treatments for their effectiveness, they are monitoring also who is worth saving/treating. This sham that Obama calls electronically converting medical records is just that...a sham. I don't understand why he doesn't LET PEOPLE KNOW exactly what it is. Part of it is...he believes we are all stupid, he backs that up with the fact that he got voted in. I mean...if I was that brazen in my lies and "denounced" people and things when they got in my way (and only then) and still got elected-I might be a little high and mighty on my intelligence over the "little people" too.

So if we pay them off as you suggest, they must stick all that money back in as federal debt.<br>  <br>   This is why I became a freight train conductor.

This package is so flawed it's unbelievable it even got passed. For one, it's so damn big. Also, the money is being spread out so much, that whoever is on the receiving end isn't going to get much at all. All this is is Congressmen paying back the industries and organizations that got them into office. Also another thing I didn't like was the expansion of unemployment benefits for laid-off workers to an entire year! Are you kidding me?! Who's going to do all these infrastructure projects if everyone is getting paid to do nothing? People simply feel they're entitled to a high paying job these days, that's what it comes down to. What someone who was just recently laid off should do is get a job at the local McDonalds or something like that and work their butts off to make ends meet, not rely on the government to support them, because their inflated egos prevent them from working a crappy job. I work over 30 hours per week doing a crappy job and go to school full time, but I do it because it's my job to take care of myself, so I get a little irked hearing about how people don't want to work for minimum wage just because they didn't used to.

The bail out stimulus package has some serious holes in it.  I think that there should be an increase of finances to pay to fix our dams, bridges & other serious structures. Rather than millions to go to studying STDs or to ACORN. But I am glad that Obama took out the part that paid to teach & perform abortions (since he realized it didn't stimulate the economy) ( guess Obama is a bit like Bush in some areas.).    The bail out should also go to our auto makers to create new energy sources autos. And not to tax people for mileage who pay the extra cost for fuel efficient auto's.

The only reson it might be percieved as conservative is because of the sadly successful deception of the neo-cons.  The Neo-cons are conservatives, but only by virtue of the fact that they changed the whole definition of the word in the public mind.    The Neo-cons are neither left or right.  They are simply the worst kind of rotten politicians on the take.  The bailout money went to people who give to their costly campaigns and have power to do them political favors.    They are now bitter at Obama because they know they can't play monkey-monkey with the next batch of money now that their leader is out of office.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	No.  I think if the Bush administration had been doing its job instead of pushing deregulation and unnecessary war we would not be in the dire economic situation that we are in.  We might have been able to return to the years of Clinton surpluses (using the same accounting methods that Bush used) instead of trying desperately to dig ourselves out of a deep recession.     In addition to surpluses instead of deficits, we wouldn't have bailouts and and taxpayer money going to banks because they would not have been necessary.  The problem now is how to address this bad economic decline and clean up the mess.  The top economists agree with the Democratic approach and, in any case, there are few options. Also, there is nothing wrong with government working closely with business as long as government is also performing oversight and regulation.    Edit:  Reagan spent a great deal of money also.

Today, most junior high school kids can master a tax return, and get it right and these are people that were educated at Ivy league and other prestigious universities, and been the leaders of multimillion dollar companies that depended on them daily to handle their finances, among other matters.  Yet they claim that these findings were errors on their part, something that they had either forgotten or was unaware of to start with. If you had a nanny and you paid her by check, you would remember when it is time to do the taxes that you paid this person for their services, and that you need to send the a statement showing what they were paid and the taxes if any that you took out. Basically, a W-2 is the form that should have been given to show their payments in the previous year.  This is part of the problem of that I knew was going to plague the Obama White House, especially when it was announced that Hillary Clinton was being nominated for the role of Secretary of State, especially with the questions surrounding he husband's finances, and the Chinese espionage ring that he declared persona non grata, after they had been found stealing billions of dollars in technology from Silicone Valley.  The Clinton's whole political lives have been shrouded in questionable actions, that could be construed as illegal, including Hillary's brother Hugh Rodham, who held a "Pardons for Dollars", during Clinton's last day in the Oval Office.

Abraham Lincoln was born in Hardin (now Larue) County, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1809. His family moved to Indiana and then to Illinois, and Lincoln gained what education he could along the way. While reading law, he worked in a store, managed a mill, surveyed, and split rails. In 1834, he went to the Illinois legislature as a Whig and became the party's floor leader. For the next 20 years he practiced law in Springfield, except for a single term (184749) in Congress, where he denounced the Mexican War.

And if health care costs aren't reigned in then even the Business elites will leave to support the Dems.  Not looking good for them.  Cultural wars are the only thing that kept them alive in 2000 and 2004, in my opinion.    I do think it would actually be bad to lose the party (although I am not a member).

We'll see.|`|7h5zhoJqaa	If that's what you think about dems, what's the reason that the Republicans haven't done anything about it?  The problem skyrocketed on their watch.  Population estimates went from 5 million in 2000 to 20 million now.  And the entire time that the GOP controlled the Congress and the White House, not a single bill was passed to reform immigration, and even the two that were proposed didn't seek to deport.  The vast majority of illegals would have been allowed to stay, with exception to criminals.  The two bills didn't pass because of other controversial elements in them.  Strategically placed there to make sure the bills wouldn't pass yet would create the image that something was being done?    The fact is that neither Democrats nor Republicans want to send any illegal immigrants back.  Voting may have something to do with the Democrats desire to not deport, but since no one is making any serious push for amnesty (note: dems have held Congress for two years), that doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense, either.    So in my mind, the real answer for both sides comes down to the reason that these people are coming into the country to begin with.  They're finding jobs from people who are willing to take advantage of their cheap labor. Big shocker there. They're costing the taxpayer while saving corporations exponentially more money.  And the corporations don't have to directly employ them - subcontractors employ them - so they're free of guilt in any raids.    Is it really any wonder to anyone why nearly nothing has been done about this on either side of the political debate?      And TruthisTrue says:    "Well 46% voted Republican in the last election. If that tells you anything."    Apparently truth isn't so true.  According to the exit polls, the Latino vote was 67%, Asian 62%, and other non-white was 66%.|`|AA10460376	POSSIBLE, BUT NOT PROBABLE......|`|XwtmNIMOaa	The republican party might be extinct in four years.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	No, unless we develop a more conservative, stronger third party.

But up until the sixth month of pregnancy...why cant the man be legally aborted from the whole situation, and not have to pay child support and have any legal obligations what so ever ???    Why stop at a certain Trimester ?  Why not allow parents to slay their children whenever they become an inconvenience, up to say age 12.  This has actually been practiced in a democratic society before you know.  Romans could kill their children without reason up to age 12.    Ok, serious comment now:  If you ever get to see a 7 week old fetus or hold a 9 week old fetus you would know that it is a human being, deserving of the rights all human beings deserve.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	"Viability" makes sense - you don't need nine months to make up your mind.    If in month seven the baby becomes a vegetable or the mother is in a car accident or something like that, fine - otherwise you need to make up your mind in a realistic time frame, and if it's viable that means it could live on its own if taken out, even if temporarily assisted - that's really tantamount to murder.    W/out parental consent?   Depends on how you define minor - let's say under 16 you should need consent.    No private hospitals shouldn't be forced to provide abortions - even if they get federal money - but they should have to allow outside clinicians to perform abortions if medical necessity requires that the abortion be performed and the mother cannot be moved.|`|R0NdLzynaa	I have always wondered why it is, pro-abortion is always called pro-choice.  I see very little choice involved.  Maybe that is why few pro-life people disagree without too much debate.  Call it what it is.  But what do I know?  I'm just a man, so pro-choice means I got no choice and can't answer your question.    BTW, no religion here, just ethics and morals.|`|AA11963685	EDIT:  I had really not heard of FOCA and as I do not accept people's assertions about what bills contain, especially when they don't provide a link, I looked it up myself.  You seem to be confused about a number of things.  This bill is to prevent the spread of states trying to pass laws that outlaw abortions in their states - which is in direct violation of Roe v. Wade.  In doing so, this bill does NOT let women abort whenever they choose.  If you don't understand what the term "viability" means, please look it up.  And a woman should be able to have an abortion past 16 weeks if her life is in danger.  She can have more children - but first she has to be alive to do so.  Here, please read the following:    (a) Statement of Policy- It is the policy of the United States that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to bear a child, to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability, or to terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability when necessary to protect the life or health of the woman.    (b) Prohibition of Interference- A government may not--    (1) deny or interfere with a woman's right to choose--    (A) to bear a child;    (B) to terminate a pregnancy prior to viability; or    (C) to terminate a pregnancy after viability where termination is necessary to protect the life or health of the woman; or    (2) discriminate against the exercise of the rights set forth in paragraph (1) in the regulation or provision of benefits, facilities, services, or information.    (c) Civil Action- An individual aggrieved by a violation of this section may obtain appropriate relief (including relief against a government) in a civil action.    http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c1...|`|45cb74f9b5bb495b15a6f3f0a1d5c694aa	I would hope that the decision to abort would be made by the 4th month.  The law is certainly broad enough to allow for it to go much longer, however.  I have a 44 year old niece who was born at 26 weeks and her mother somehow didn't know she was pregnant, which I still don't understand.  She just went into labor, thought she had the flu and then went to the hospital when she started bleeding.    No, I don't think women should be able to have a late term abortion, but then if you mandate a certain time that's where all the argument starts.    Yes, Minors should be allowed abortion w/o parental consent.    I guess you are referring to Catholic hospitals here.  Catholic hospitals should be avoided at all costs period.  Remember Terry Schaivo?  But, yes, hospitals and doctors should not be asked to be a part of something they morally disagree with - UNLESS they are being paid any part of their salary/income by federal or state dollars.    Yeah, it's easy for the prolifers to agree, they just say no to it all and all to often to contraceptives and education as well.    Bottom line - religious groups should stay out of this issue.      from Wiki:  Roe v. Wade centrally held that a mother may abort her pregnancy for any reason, up until the "point at which the fetus becomes viable." The Court defined viable as being "potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks."[1] The Court also held that abortion after viability must be available when needed to protect a woman's health, which the Court defined broadly in the companion case of Doe v. Bolton. These rulings affected laws in 46 states.|`|xo4iux9gaa	Apparently , given the freedom, Most liberal Democrats want them to be able to murder their children up to the age of 2 yrs.|`|W0VL46gDaa	ugh, I hate abortion.     It brings such hate, separation, guilt, sorrow, regret... what good comes out of it?    "Yay Im so happy I just killed my baby today!" ?      maybe the pro choicers should get their tubes tied and sperm flow cut off... Stop having sex or use a little BC. Dont punish an innocent life, take responsibility for your actions.|`|AA10687492	I think there should be regulations on how late you can have an abortion. Minors, yes yes to parental consent. Hell, you need parental consent to pierce your ears!    Private hospitals should be able to say no to providing abortions.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	I have no problem with society drawing the line a viability, say prior to the third trimester, with exceptions for the life/health of the mother.    For the rest of it, the choice should be between the woman/girl and her doctor.  No restriction.  No parental involvement (if they were adequately involved perhaps the girl would not be pregnant in the first place, yes, where was Palin).  No refusal to provide service.  Medical care is just that, medical care - not a political statement.    Bottom line: the pro-lifers should keep their religion out of my life and I'll keep my religion out of theirs.    EDIT: I will support FOCA.  If you want to reduce abortions adopt, join adoptions support groups, contribute to adoption efforts and work to change laws to facilitate adoption.  Do not impose your beliefs on me.|`|sxecXFgraa	A minor cannot legally sign waivers that doctors and hospitals have for everything so I don't see how they can have an abortion without the parents consenting to it.  If the hospital is a privately funded hospital then the hospital should be able to decide on what procedures they will and will not do, from abortion to sex change operations to plastic surgery.  I don't think women should be able to have abortions after 6 months.  At this stage, the baby could survive outside of the mother's womb.  Also, I feel a woman should not be able to have an abortion unless the father of the baby agrees.|`|SGyRIjCIaa	There should be no line to be drawn. The heart begins to beat at 4 weeks which is the same time a home pregnancy test can be done effectively. Can any of you tell me how you could go on living if you didn't have a beating heart? Please email me because I think the medical world would be very interested in that.    Should women be able to have an abortion at any point throughout the 9+ months? No    Should minors be able to have an abortion without parental consent?  No    Should private hospitals be forced to provide abortions if their entire establishment is prolife? No    Pro-choice is hypocritical. Which is just like a liberal. Women have a choice - close your legs if you cannot support a child! It's a pretty easy choice.|`|k6hicodfaa	To the first question--no.  There should be some limit.  Regarding parental consent.  Absolutely not.  Imagine having to ask your dad who raped you for consent for an abortion.  Abortions are provided at hospitals all the time, sometimes one is needed to ensure that everything is okay after a miscarriage.|`|XwtmNIMOaa	Very few women have late term abortion so making it illegal is not needed.   Minors should be able to get an abortion without parental consent.  Private hospitals should have to preform abortions if the health of the mother is at risk.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	All liberals concerned about over populating the planet should immediately kill off their kin (children too) and commit suicide!|`|KasFZL7laa	i am very pro-choice, however, to answer your questions, in order:    1.)  no.  there needs to be a time frame.  if they fail to have an abortion past a certain time (i.e. when the fetus can survive on it's own outside the womb) the mother should then consider adoption.    2.)  i believe girls who are at the age of consent should be able to have abortions without parental consent.  in most states that age is 16.    3.)  private hospitals (such as catholic) should perform abortions ONLY if it is necessary to save the life of the mother.  as for routine abortions, no.  if a mother chooses to abort, she needs to go to a health clinic that specializes in such a practice.|`|5ZfcMc34aa	Roe v wade spelled it out in the ruling:    [The Court defined viable as being "potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.

When in your life a serious or life threatening event occurs, you should be able to make a different decision.      2) Yes.  Who knows what physical abuse a girl may be subjected to when she tells her parent(s). And let's just avoid the entire issue of family member rape.    3) If they receive medicare funding and they perform medicare procedures, yes.  If you do the work, do the work.  Should pharmacists be allowed to choose what drugs they dispense? So i go to the local catholic hospital for a procedure and they find out I have an ectopic pregnancy and I WILL die unless the pregnancy is terminated.  Why would they not save my life?    A woman either has a right to a safe abortion or she doesn't.  I cannot see a social benefit in compelling a woman/child to carry a child she does not want, may not be able to care for, or maybe didn't even consent to the sexual act.|`|9FI7zaKraa	I say if its o.k. to kill up to 9mo. lets make it o.k to kill e'm till they are 18.|`|HzVE4kz1aa	we should consider a 1 child rule, we are overpopulating the planet at a disgusting rate.  we're going to have wars over food at some point, and I'm not going for Soylent Green.  babies are the enemy.  babies will steal your food.|`|60YMS1xkaa	Personally, I find abortion at 7-8 months disgusting. The woman should have made a choice by then. But whenever is fine. We're already over populated, hundreds of children die in Africa, more in wars, etc. I'm sure she has her reasons.    Minors should not be able to have abortion without parental consent - just like they can't vote or drive - I'm not sure why they would be allowed to. We have to trust the parents would do whats best for the WOMAN. I think, though, just in case they're some religious nuts obsessed with their pro-life stance, we should be able to help the minor get an abortion.    Yes, they should.    It doesn't matter how much we vary - all it comes down to is we believe in a woman's rights. After that we have our own limits.    @Jo: No woman does that. Abortion is NOT a preferred form of birth control like you pro-lifers seem to think so.    Edit: FOCA seems okay.  ~ I live in Canada. Abortion is legal in all provinces and their rights are very limited. I am very happy with it.|`|d0836e0785bb7c6faea2b62558249361aa	I think we need to attack the root cause of the problem, instead of putting a bandaid over it. Parents need to teach sex ed or at least make sure their children are responsible enough not to get pregnant.    Some people say "abortion only for rape/incest/parents life in danger, but in cases of rape, Plan B can be used, and cases of incest either Plan B or sometimes its usually too late when the incest is discovered and the child has already been born.    If there is a case where the mothers life is in danger, then that should be at any trimester.|`|vbogmcnpaa	LOOKING AT THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION, I CONSIDER IT A TRAVESTY THAT ABORTION ISN'T RETROACTIVE.

SWkaGJpgaa	While the House Republicans don't have the ability to prevent the Democrats from enacting their agenda, the Senate Republicans have enough votes to filibuster (prevent cloture) on a bill under consideration.     Per Senate rules, there must be 60 votes to invoke cloture, which ends debate and discussion on a bill. Only then can the bill go to a vote. The Democrats do not have 60 votes, so if the GOP act in concert, they can filibuster the bill.    Now, whether the Senate GOP has the grit to stand against this bill is debatable. But, theoretically, they can do so. And they can hold it off until it is acceptable to them. If they can take the heat.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Yes, the Democrats do need the GOP to pass things.

697f4b7e2abf668416acd21a3fe138f0aa	In Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution...    "The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect TAXES,..."    There are only a few limits on that power.  Exports cannot be taxed, indirect taxes must be geographically uniform and direct taxes must be apportioned.     The 16th amendment clarifies that income taxes are to be treated as INDIRECT taxes.    "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration."  http://www.senate.gov/civics/constitutio...    Using that power, Congress has enacted several tax laws through the years. In fact, the first income tax law in the U.S. was enacted in 1861 and was NEVER found to be unconstitutional. Our current tax laws get their basic structure from the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  It was enacted on October 22, 1986. That law has been amended several times in the years between then and now.  The tax laws are codified as Title 26 of the U.S. Code. You can read the 1986 law in the U.S. Statutes at Large in Volume 100 starting on page 2085.  You can find the U.S. Statutes at Large in most Federal Depository Libraries and most law libraries.  You can read Title 26 at http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/ or at http://uscode.house.gov/download/title_2...|`|6Gfz125Paa	Where in the U.S. Constitution or any other official document does it state that the government has the right to tax my income?    In the 16th amendment.      What written law states I have to pay income tax to the U.S.Government and where/when was that law enacted?    The Internal Revenue Code.  Enacted in Washington, DC.  Current version redesignated in 1986.|`|kPWGVeWhaa	so...do you not want roads or an army?|`|AA10118655	The 16th Amendment give Congress the right to pass laws to tax your income. And they did just that: It's called the Internal Revenue Code (or U.S. Tax Code), and can be found in Title 26 of the U.S. Code.    If you don't believe that, just don't pay it. Explain to the judge that there is no law saying you have to pay income tax and see if he agrees with you. So far, everyone that has tried it has been told they are wrong. But who knows, you may be the first to get a judge to agree with you.|`|AA10621418	constitution    The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States    dont try to fight it, you wont win|`|Kgi2RxhBaa	Why don't you want to pay income taxes?

Without income taxes, none of those would exist.|`|ZY95NCzJaa	There is no legal basis in the Constitution for the IRS to exist and tax our income.  For many years after the country was founded there was no such thing as income tax.  Income taxes came about as the country grew and the scope of government responsibility increased.  The reality is that the USA could not survive now with an income tax.

The bail out money was not requested by Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo's Chairman objected...    "Mr. Kovacevich of Wells Fargo objected that his bank, based in San Francisco, had avoided the mortgage-related woes of its Wall Street rivals. He said the investment could come at the expense of his shareholders..."    This was not a government present, it was a secured loan.  Banks like Wells Fargo issues preferred stock to the treasury, at a floating rate between 5% and 9%.  This loan can be repaid at anytime.  Wells Fargo took the funds to even the playing field and because they were warned that if they did not take the funds at that moment there may not be another opportunity.  Both Bank of America and  AIG received more funds and have had more spending controversy.      The event for Wells Fargo was a recognition event for it's top producing mortgage consultants.  As a result of the media backlash; Wells Fargo has canceled all of it's annual recognition events for the year.  Of course top executives attend these events and I'm sure they enjoy it.  It's an opportunity for the hard working every day employees to meet top executives.      Doesn't seem fair that one of the more responsible banks can't reward it's hard working employees.|`|lJbLxz39aa	This is BS!!!

The best idea would be to check out our website or pop into your local office and make an enquiry.
HXIIbVN8aa	There is nothing about the package to indicate that it will stimulate the economy or create jobs. It is a program to advance Obama/Pelosi's political and social programs such as socialized medicine.  It is more new deal stuff which should be shunned. The new deal did not create jobs nor did it stimulate the economy and, in fact, it made the depression last longer than it otherwise would have..  There is a bvillion bucks in their for ACORN, the leftist political rabblerouser group. The program increases the size of the childhood meidcal program to cover the children of people making up to $200,000 annually. It is an attempt to get as many people as possible on the government dole and dependent on the government   ( democrats) so they will vote accordingly.  The so called stimulus would give checks to people who do not pay income taxes at all.   It is, pure and simple, redistribution of wealth from those who have it to those who want. It's Karl Marx communist manifesto almost verbatim.  There is nothing in this program to help the mortgage holders who are facing foreclosure, nothing to help get home building back underway, nothing to help credit card holders who are facing reduced credit limits and outlandish credit card interest charges which will force many into bankruptcy, nothing to prevent banks from arbitrarily changing the terms and rates on your credit card when you have nothing to say about it. There is nothing to compel banks to start lending money and get the system working again.  The so-called stimulus program is a fraud.|`|axeuS4zJaa	Because Obama's stimulus is ridiculous spending. $25 million for decreasing lead paint, $25 million for drug counseling....how is that going to create jobs??|`|jzFYMMU2aa	the Republicans are not trying to bock the stimulus.they are just playing partisan politics.even those that agreed with it were told to vote against it.not one voted for it.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	Obama promised a bill with no pork. Pelosi added a water theme park, and 300 million to fight STD's. The senate added 800 million for fighting bird flu. Thats just 3 pork projects out of hundreds that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy, and have everything to do with rewarding special interests.   Im very disappointed that Obama has allowed this to go this far. Spend 800 billion? No problem. But spend it on things like mortgage relief, infrastructure, and job creation. Theres 800 million allocated to building DSL and high speed cable to rural areas. Let Verizon and ATT pay for that.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Apparently, republicans are the only people left in WDC who know corruption when they see it.|`|AA10546011	Too much pork in it.    And why will just pouring more money at a problem fix it?|`|AA10187742	Because the so called "package" was a SPENDING package, not necessarily a "stimulus" package.  Know your facts please before asking such a question.|`|AA11593971	I can't speak for Republican politicians, but a great number of Republican voters were dead set against the first bailout package and are dead set against it now. Perhaps the politicians finally got the message and are actually doing what their constituents want.|`|BsQcplTQaa	Because as is its a huge pork spending bill that has very little to do with stimulating the economy.|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	Because it is full of BS spending!|`|89YkHxMUaa	Look up the political term ''pork barrel'' oh ya and useless funding towards programs that we dont need to worry about now.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	Its full of special interest packages and paybacks for electing Obama.

k6hicodfaa	Yes, although I don't agree with it for a variety of reasons.    Who am I to make life decisions for a woman I don't know?|`|XDQNxzw1aa	I'm not liberal, but I support it.  Who are we to tell someone how many kids they're allowed to have?  Married or not, living alone or with parents, regardless of the number of kiddos at home - it's still her right to make that decision.      How will she provide for them: probably assistance from taxpayers.  It makes me unhappy to know my tax dollars financially support these sorts of situations, but there really isn't anything to do about it.  The government doesn't ask my opinion on how we should sped money.  But I digress.

eTspmrjMaa	They are exempt because of religion and the elite that run the world are waiting for something that you don't know about. That is probably the shortest answer possible to any extremely long set of circumstances that explains everything that I cannot be bothered to even try to get into right now. The sooner Israel who I don't recognise as a nation is wiped from the face of this Earth the better. The Jews can go and live in America and Israeli land can return to the Palestinians.

We have more in common with our Israelite brothers and sisters than their infidel neighbors in the Middle East.  And we tend to forget that we have Christian brothers and sisters in every country around the world; and if our immediate neighbors such as Mexico and Canada endorsed terrorist actions from groups within their borders against the US, we would not be above using necessary force to protect ourselves.  I think the most important thing is to have all the facts before calling someone a Jew or Gentile without knowing the cause and effect of actions involved in the name of National Security; and I don't remember an Israeli leader calling their neighbors vermin and that they didn't have the right to exist.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	so....you're saying there's no "law" against launching rockets from civilian areas into civilian areas...?    ....or there's no "law" against violating a cease fire.....again?    ...So please put the whole "International Law" charade aside for now and tell me....why so hostile?  How can you say "justice" when you are so blind to one side...    might it be simply because they're Jews.....hmmmmmm?|`|AA11424005	You assume too much.  Not all Israelis are Jews.  There are people of many religions living in Israel.  There are not too many international laws that all nations subscribe to.  The Laws of Admiralty have been adopted by most countries.  Israel follows those laws.  The Israelis have the right to defend themselves, no matter how they do it.  The US took that approach with Japan at the end of WWII.|`|5ac2dCxJaa	I don't get it. I was talking about this with somebody and I was called anti-semetic. My aunt is Jewish, I have nothing what so ever against Jewish people but I can not even logically discuss the State of Israel in any manner that is not favorable or I am anti semetic. As if questioning the actions of Israel is some how equatable to Hitler. So I asked another question, understanding that Jews were persecuted, and we are not to forget it. Fine but why do we not bring slavery and the plight of the Native Americans in the same fashion?    There are scores of propaganda released every year that only hold Israel in favor due to the holocaust yet many more Africans and Indians and Native Latin Americans killed by conquest yet we don't see near the volume not even close.    Israel is wrong in fact they have exceeded by any stretch the atrocities of Saddam Hussein, and they need to be held to the same standards that we judge any nation. No better no less.|`|AnhoHRFTaa	As a Jew I must agree with you, it is because we are exempt by virtue of the fact that we are Jews. You demanded an answer, kind of like a Hitler Black Shirt.

Nighty nighty and don't forget to wipe your little bum and wash behind your ears|`|AA11916920	So, what you are saying, is that if you get attacked by a neighboring country, that you are not allowed to fight back...ever?  They are building on stolen land huh, and expanding every day?  I guess you don't know much about history and you must have forgotten Israel giving up the Gaza strip a few years ago.  Remember the jews who had to be forced from their land by force?  I guess not.  Hamas has started this entire recent conflict, unprovoked.  Israel did not let the cease fire end and then randomly start lobbying rockets into Gaza, it was the other way around.  Why does Israel ensure their own people don't have access to the Mosque or the Golden done, even though history proves that Mosque and dome are on the land of not 1 but 2 of Israels holy temples (one that held the Arc of the Convent)    No, Israel is just a buch of blood thirsty terrorist starting fights.

This is a very bad analogy. There are always sub-groups within a society that have more power and influence than other sub-groups. Jews gained control over the banking institutions in Europe largely because The Vatican forbade Catholic bankers from charging interest in the Middle-Ages and Renaissance. By the time of the Reformation, the European banking system was largely in the hands of Jewish bankers. "Germany" was still a group of un-unified states well into the 19th Century. Until unification, the nobles went on measuring wealth by land ownership and military strength. Meanwhile the middle-classes accumulated more wealth and began to assert itself through banking and capitalism.     Looking at German politics from the late 19th century through the early 20th century, one can hardly blame the Jews for the condition of the government. The Kaiser wasn't Jewish nor were the "brilliant" military commanders of Germany who developed a ridiculous plan of war leading to WWI. Likewise, I can't believe it was Jews who were responsible for Germany's economic situation following WWI. We can blame the US, UK, and France for that. Hitler's notions that Jews were responible are almost totally unfounded. I also have to wonder what control over the economy and media the Catholics, Slavs, and Gypsies had in Germany as well.     By your assessment, I suppose the Founding Fathers of the US were also too powerful. White-Anglo-Saxon-Protestants controlled both the economy and media in colonial America. So someone should have offed them too, right?     I suppose we could eliminate all religions from the face of the earth. How would we place the "blame" then? Maybe Marx was on to something? Perhaps we should give Communism another shot? It worked wonders for Russia.     Oh...and the reason Germany was at an all time economic high during Hitler's time was because he nationalized all heavy industry, eliminated labor laws, and once he was able to round up Jews, Communists, Slavs, and Catholics, he put them to work as slave labor. So during this time the media and economy were under the control of one man...Hitler. You state that it's bad to have one group control the economy and media yet at the same time say it was good to have it all under the control of a single individual. Check your lower leg for powder burns, friend, because you've just shot yourself in the foot!|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Now, there's no problem in saying one group should not have so much power. And it might be understandable that he went to an extreme.    But I do not think Hitler was "going to an extreme". Hitler wasn't trying to balance out the power, Hitler was actively trying to destroy the Jews, and blamed all problems on them.|`|uHwIz8U3aa	I agree that not one group should  have all the power,but hitler wanted his race to be the superior one in everything, power, money etc.|`|XuExU7KMaa	You idiot! ' hitlers idea was that one group should not have so much power' How stupid can you be...His idea was exactly that, except it was him and his 'group' that wanted all the power.

Nice to be done, isnt it! :-)    You are full-time during your training period, bringing home(after taxes) about $1100 every two weeks, more if you are married... Drill weekends you will bring home about $180 after taxes as an E-3. Work up in rank/time in service, you will take home more($250/month for me).You also get medical insurance for free while on active duty for training or any training over 30 days long.    You can choose whatever job the unit you are looking at joining has open if you meet the ASVAB score/physical profile for each job.    Yes, you can enter as an officer if there is a slot open and you have the requirements met(AFOQT, package in, etc)    Yes, health benefits are free during your active duty training, and can be purchased for $47/month once you are in part-time status. Dental is $10/month, life insurance is $20/month, all taken from your drill paycheck. Good deal for great coverage(I use all of this).    Many ANG jobs offer a $20,000 enlistment bonus, student loan repayment program, GI Bill, and tuition assistance. I have also used all of the mentioned incentives as well, all were paid out as promised.  Email me for more info on the ANG if you want, glad to shoot it to you straight.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	1.

No you cannot choose any job you want, reserve units have specific jobs in them, you have to choose one of the jobs thats available in the reserve unit you join.    3. If you apply for AF OTS and are accepted, you could. You will need a GPA of around 3.5 to be accepted.    4. Reserves do not offer health benefits, although you can sign up to purchase tricare and pay the full cost yourself.    It cost the same as any other health insurance.

5f930dd66cfee7f04720c41de82939d8aa	People that are smart don't want to be a manager at Starbucks.  Frankly that's a real cr@ppy dead end job.  Most people go to college to get the credentials that will give them the ability to step up into some job of their choice.  Then there are the truly unworthy whose parents pay for and send them to college, they don't apply themselves and get out with a piece of paper and the ability to do nothing.  Those are the people that end up working at Starbucks and middle management everywhere.  Education can give you a lot more than just the book learning part.  There is much more to it and the training usually benefits those that apply themselves and it is obvious.  And then there are the connections one makes if you go to the right college.  You will not be wasting 4 years of your life and being a nurse will give you social status and respect.  You will be able to command a great salary and work whereever and whenever you want because the demand is so great.  The down side is burnout to nursing but there are always options.  And college is actually a lot fun as well as hard work.<br>  I went to college later in life after being really hurt.  I plowed through all the accounting courses and got a BA.  I did my time doing flunky accounting in a couple of jobs and then started my own business so I make the money, not my boss.  I bought some rental property so that I have income later in life too.  Now my rentals are almost paid for and I work when I want.  I have clients that pay a ridiculous amount of money to prepare their work for a CPA.  I charge less than the CPA so they are delighted to pay and I do very good work.  I work a couple days a week and spend the rest of the time doing as I please. . .and that is a lot of beach time and time to go out and photograph all the elusive animals around here.  It was a lot of work to get here but the trip was so worth it and now life is very pleasant.  I never wanted to work for anyone else so my plan fit me perfectly and now that I have reached the end of it, I have time to sit here and type this to you and know that I am making money while I sit.  Make a plan, stick to it and do all the work.  Make sure that you end up where you want to be. . .doing what you want to do.  It's important so that you enjoy your life.  Management suits a lot of folks because they want to tell others what to do. . .check out the folks in those classes. . .scary.  Check out the folks in the harder degree plans. . .they are going somewhere.  Unless you want someone else to tell you what to do all the time, get that degree.  And managers are a dime a dozen and are very replaceable so you have to know how to kiss @ss.  Ugh. . .Good things aren't easy but pay off in the long run.<br>  Yes I read your question but are you sure you have the ability to save that money and how long will all that take.  And who will lend you money because you have no experience in running a business and no education.  And most businesses go belly up because people don't know what they are doing. . .But good luck. . .you will need it.|`|4a2b4c38598195f530e54c08fa3e232aaa	How is this a political question.  Perhaps you should post this in the careers section.|`|77E384Wpaa	You seem to be a very togehter person and I hope this helps.  I didn't realize that it was difficult to get into nursing programs but as you say it is, this is what I would do.  I would volunteer in a hospital, clinic or any medical facility where I could to get to know people in that area(maybe have to work a 'regular' job too).  A lot of times they will have programs for education or connections you can use to get into a nursing program.  <br>  <br>  I thought I wantedto be a rock musician but that didn't pan out.  I went to one year of college before I went to Florida to 'make it' in music.  After trying to break into music for a couple of years, I got on with computer company in customer service and played music on the side.  Within 10 years I was making 6 figures as a consultant in customer service and still playing the drums for several bands, movies and recording.  I eventually sent my resume in to Almeda College and University and got a Business BA.  <br>  <br>  The moral is to do want you want that makes you happy regardless of the money, you will live a much happier life, be a better partner to someone and overall better person.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and God Bless.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	I am currently going to Cal State San Marcos, just north of San Diego (near Oceanside and Encinitas).

HE IS A COMMUNIST.     he wants to force all the people who went to college and worked their asses off to give all their money to the high-school dropouts who sit around and do nothing all day. I'm sick of the whiners who are like "Oh, its not fair! Rich people should give us their money!" Seriouly, shut up.     My family is going to have our taxes increased out the butt because we're in the top 8% of earners in the country. However, because we live in DC, we can't even afford to buy a house in the area, not to mention put me and my to siblings through college. Obama needs to die. NOW.
9tcv3TiWaa	No and yes.      No, if he has just enlisted and in AIT unless you are married you cannot live together.    No, if he is E4 and below and living in barracks.  You can attempt to live together but he will not get BAH (Housing Allowance) so it will be coming out of your own pockets.    Yes possibly if he is E5 and above and there isnt enough barrack rooms.  The command can authorize him to live off base and get BAH w/o dependents.    You will not qualify for base housing or any benefits unless you are married.|`|AA10709853	no.  as he is single he is ineligible to live anywhere but the barracks.      he is not eligible to live in housing or in town until he is married. or reaches the Paygrade of E5.     also if he is still in AIT you would not be permitted to live with him even if you were married.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	The poster above me is wrong.  Yes you could, but it would be expensive as he would not receive BAH (housing allowance).  He would have to maintain his barracks room (keep it, and keep it clean, etc.) and just live with you.  Lots of lower ranking guys do it.  However, I've known many units who will give BAH to E-3's and E-4's if their barracks rooms are cramped.    Unless he is in AIT or many other schools, then he is not allowed to live with you.    I wouldn't recommend it, though.  I would recommend just getting married.  Just get the permissions that you need, and go to the courthouse and get your license.  You can have a judge marry you. You will be on tricare, have coverage for you and the baby, and he will receive BAH so you can live off post or in housing.  Otherwise wait until you are 18.      Him missing 8 months of pregnancy will be the least of it when he deploys.|`|dLq96ieYaa	My husband is in the Army and unless you are married you can not live with him. He will have to live in the barracks unless he is either married or has a defendant in which he will get BAH. However when the baby is born if the child lives with him at least half the year he gets permission to also live off base if you are not married by then because kids don't live in the Barracks. Or if he is a E-5 he can get BAH being single or E-4 if there is little room in the Barracks. Well if your parents don't care if you get married just go to the courthouse and get married there and have a bigger wedding later. Good Luck with everything.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Well, since you are a minor, I have to assume that he is not an officer.  Therefore, he is probably enlisted, and junior enlisted at that.  Therefore, he will be required to live on base in the barracks/dorms (this means you cannot move in with him).  Until you get married, he cannot move off base...period.    Once you two are married, you can move into family housing on base or get an allowance to live off base.|`|AA11593134	He would get more pay if you get married. And even if he was in the barracks, if you were married, you can get base housing or eligible to get house/apartment off base. So better to get married and I think all your problems would be solved.   And if he's single and E4 and below, the other posters are correct, he will have to live in the barracks. It is up to him if he wants to get another place so he can be with you but he will have to pay out of his own pockets. He will get housing allowance if you were married. So again, better to get married.  : )    I'm thinking you are having problems getting married because you're not 18 yet? and you cannot get permission from parent(s)? I don't know what to do about that...  But you said your fiance? Which means wedding plans are in order (and engaged)? Then why not get married sooner?|`|alpDOHtkaa	He can live WHEREVER he wants, but will only receive BAH (basic allowance for housing) if he has a dependent. A dependent is any person who is legally or financially dependent on him i.e. a spouse or child or disabled family member. While he a trainee in IET, he must reside in the barracks.|`|7lTIiL60aa	well yes you 2 could live together but he first has to get permission to live off base and or keep a room there and a appt in ur name now he wont get any b.a.h. (basic housing allowance) so it will come out of his pocket but yes there are ways around it|`|HuAIaEJjaa	No even if you were 18 you could not.  The army considers relationship status the follow    Single  Married    There is no engaged.    Also, if hes at AIT unless it gets approved by his CO he will most likely not be able to live off base even if married|`|9CzB4VG4aa	girl im goin through the same thing well i thought i was pregnant but it turned out i wasnt ..... but im 17 and my man is in the marines and i really want to get married with him ....but wen i thought i was pregnant he told his corpral and supposlily he was gonna get to move out the barracks to live with me for the babyyy but i dont know you should just get married so he wont missthose 8 months of the baby growin cause wen i thought i was prego i was readii to get married ASAP cause i didnt want him to miss any thing welll goooddd luck and just know ur not alonee mama

I also want him to succeed for the simple fact that it will mean America will succeed. I agree with him on pulling out of Iraq and focusing on Afghanistan. I agree with opening dialog with Iran and Cuba. I don't agree with the bailout package. I don't agree with some of his cabinet picks.     I hope he does well however I am skeptical. But as commander in chief he has my support just as much as the last did.|`|PRCfCSDxaa	NO! Not only do I not agree with ANY of his policies but I will never and may I repeat NEVER support a man who disrespects his own country!
dkkdt1FEaa	You are a Canadian citizen  You are a Canadian citizen if you were born outside Canada and:    you were born after February 14, 1977; and   you had a parent who was Canadian at the time of your birth.   So her child is a citizen, but she has to get permission from her husband to take her child to canada or it will be considered parental abduction|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	this could be difficult.     you need to have SOLE custody of the boy in order to be able to take him back to Canada.   And you will need the fathers birth certificate, your birth certificate,  your marriage certificate and the boys birth certificate. Copies of all of these to the Canadian embassy in Canberra, to get the boy a Canadian citizenship card.     Then the card can be used to get a Canadian passport.     There is one other thing.   Parental abduction (if it should occur) is a crime in Canada, but it is NOT a crime in Australia.     I read a book review about another canadian-australian marriage gone bad and what happened when the aussie husband kidnapped the kids from their canadian mother (reverse from you I know)  see link below|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	she can not take the child out of australia without the fathers permission or a court order declaring she has been granted sole custody and has the courts permission    no ifs or buts

He's already half white.  He belongs to white people just as much as he belongs to black people.    2. "African American" is a term that refers to blacks in America who are descended from slaves.  Obama is not.    And no, I despise his political views.  I'm more of an Alan Keyes person myself.|`|t4F59gf2aa	I like that you hate white people, being bitter and jealous must be a terrible way to live oh well to bad for you.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	No I'd rather see someone with experience, like Collin Powell.|`|600367b3135824b97a54e03105e6a6feaa	black people are always the most racist.|`|0kjWE73qaa	You shouldn't support someone because of their skin color, just like you shouldn't be against someone because of their skin color. I personally don't like Obama, but that's because of politics, not race. I don't think he should be running this country, but I think I would be friends with him if we met (as long as politics doesn't come up in our conversation).|`|E1wGuCavaa	Belong to me?  Does he belong to you?  I don't think he'd be too pleased to hear that he belongs to anyone.     In the sense that he is my president too, he DOES belong to me.  In the sense that his victory is a victory not only for black people, but for anyone who was tired of white male presidents, he DOES belong to me.    I don't try to claim him as biracial, who cares anyway.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Maybe someday we can have a black president who isnt a racist.  Wouldnt things finally be equal then?

What I do wish is that all these race baiting idiots would stop it already and let's get to work making "changes" that actually do some good.

That's what I wish!|`|ohxiNOFjaa	I voted for him and, you may not be trying to be racist but, you are.|`|kdSuwt8paa	He is everybody's president now - even the people who didn't vote for him.

Why don't you people claim Clarence Thomas, Michael Steele, or Colin Powell?  Or do black republicans not count as people to you?    If it's okay to claim someone based on their race then why is it wrong to judge them based on their race?

He doesn't get the same treatment as you because he's actually strived for something.  He is treated as an intellectual.  The only "ill treatment" I see happening to blacks is in their minds.  They're the ones holding themselves back because they've grown accustomed to playing the victim.    Now this isn't being racist, because I've noticed that we as a culture tend to victimize ourselves as a whole.  Nobody's willing to take the blame for their actions.  We, as a nation, have to pull ourselves out of these self delusions and take responsibility for what we are.  We shape the world we live in, and it's time we step up to the plate.|`|POzCKBzvaa	Funny how successful you are at being racist without even trying...|`|axeuS4zJaa	Well, his mother is white but Obama seems to be embarrassed of his white side since he denies it so much and labels himself a black man.

However, I do not share your enthusiasm regarding the Obama Presidency. I do not believe this man was the right person to be President and his actions to date have done nothing to change this opinion. The reality is that while Obama has the opportunity to do great things, he also has the power to set racial integration back years if he does not act responsibly in his position. So I would say we have a true double-edged sword.|`|lUYeHIWpaa	I think you are so wrong. Why is it so important for you to call him black? He is mixed so deal with that yourself! And his skin is not black, its brown. Do you rally want all "white" people to not like Barack Obama and not feel that they are close to him?  Why does it matter to you that white people want to claim him, they should, they have also voted for him to be their president.  I really don't understand your problem?|`|29Lrkdunaa	Why would that be considered trying to "claim" him? The fact remains that he is half white and half black. So, Why are blacks trying to claim him? What's with all this racial issue? He's an American and he's our president. When are people going to start seeing him as a person instead of as a color?|`|aDhc9n1waa	I sure don't.  Although, I would love to "claim" him as one of mine in race terms, I don't see it like that.  We are all humans, and that's that. It's just our colors vary, and to know that we discriminated against them to begin with makes me sick.  I am very proud to be living in a nation that finally has opened its eyes, and realized that color does not dictate what greatness or superiority looks like.  We've seen past that, and he has won a great victory for himself, and his race.    I'm in love with that, and I hope to see many more of different ethnic backgrounds in the future to come.    Who ever fits the bill to do the job should be chosen, and he has done just that.  Now, on my end, I was a conservative for the most part, and I am of white ancestry... I feel full of shame, that I have to claim Both BUSHs'  and carry that around with me.  If anything, we (the white race) owes the black race among others a long over due apology.    gOBAMA!    We Did It !     And I am a proud voter of President Barack Obama !     And I totally agree with you, on the whole front of others calling him biracial.. yes he may be... however his lifestyle remains of black roots.  And that's a beautiful thing!

AA11163314	Not even close to the 'only' option.    How about this    A tax credit for every new, full-time employee hired by a company.    A cut in the business tax rate so that we are equal to the average business tax rate in Europe.    Transfer of money from 'stimulus spending' to defense spending.  This way you create well-paying jobs instead of minimum wage jobs planting grass in DC.    Cut all funds devoted to 'earmarks' and instead have that spending voted on to pass or fail on its own merits.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	The government has NEVER in our nations history been able to spend its way out of a recession.

Cut payroll tax so that money goes straight to people every pay check instead of government promising money but getting their share first.  Then cut certain regulations that just keep small businesses from getting off the ground.  Years ago if you wanted to cut hair you just needed something sharp, now you have to have so many chairs, a permit, a proper building...etc.  Just an example but you get the idea.|`|0dXUWjldaa	Better Idea than Obama's plan:  Tax cuts for small businesses without the massive spending projects.  Make Bush tax cuts permanent, cut all aid to foreign countries and continents, pull back the troops in countries outside of active fighting zones, and cut pay for all government employees (from president to the DMV).    As a counter point, big businesses are responsible for a large portion of permanent jobs and giving them more money back would, in theory, help create more jobs.  The same is true with small business owners.      One final solution $1,000,000,000,000 divided by 200,000,000 taxpayers (approx. figures) is $5000.  Couldn't every taxpayer use $5000 in their pockets to stimulate the economy better than infrastructure tasks that aren't supposed to start for another 2-4 years?|`|B1XT60WEaa	Our only option at this point is to suffer.

The store isnt dumb,  and neither are its L.P. (Loss Provention) staff.   They will see a pattern here,  and will hone in on people taking that particular product into that particular section.   You WILL be caught,  its a matter of when,  should you continue.    Good for you for quitting.   Stay on the path,  there are many helpful resources out there to help you.     If you do it and are caught stealing,   Your parents wont go to jail (they will be responsible to pay any fine or restitution you get hit with).   You wont be put into a foster home.       The last point though,  in court,  it will be mentioned that the method of disposing of the packaging and the stolen product (your M.O.) was used x number of times so far,  it wont look good on you either way.    My answer is stay on the path,  you should be ok.|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	No...you're parents won't go to jail.    No...you won't be sent to a foster family.    Yes ... your fingerprints and possibly DNA could be recovered.    Look at your problem from a more mature point of view.    You stole something which costs the rest of us money. The business raises their prices to cover the costs of theft....thank you very much for making this world harder to survive in.    You were putting something in to your body in excess....you're not only hurting other patrons...but yourself!    You could face the juvenile court system which some think isn't a problem...but get caught in my jurisdiction...my Juvenile Judge here doesn't play games!

YvqiIkZCaa	This will depend on who will follow what customs. If the US President (assuming he is male) marries a queen, the queen can force the tradition of her country and the President would become a Prince (In Britain) or a King (depending if the nation allows that or is what they called the husband of the queen). However, the queen can abdicate her throne and become the first lady. Since they both rule a country, there must be a consensus done between the pair. It is for this reason royal families, try as much as possible, not to wed with a future ruler of another country or a ruler of the said country.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	Nothing.

Even if you get conservatorship...which I assume is like what we call guardianship in my state, for someone who is not competent to handle their own affairs...the guardian, or whatever they're called there, probably can't gift the property without the court's permission and a good reason to do so.  After she dies, all you have to do is probate the will, which doesn't necessarily require an attorney but most people find it a difficult process to navigate without an attorney's help.
yX4xVukPaa	Arguably consideration doesn't really serve much of a purpose any more.<br>  <br>  1. Consideration is only required where for enforceability where the contract is not a deed. The formalities for making a deed now amount to no more, in essence, than a signed contract, many contracts will be deeds, because they are signed. Relatively few will be subject to the requirement of consideration at all.<br>  <br>  2. Some of the classical consideration issues - such as those rebellious sailors in Stilk v Myric, are now dealt with in more modern ways - such as economic duress. It is under those doctrines that a Stilk-like case would be decided today. Similar issues to do with debtors settling with their creditors.<br>  <br>  3. Is consideration *really* necessary? There's already the massive exception for deeds. Its main function appear to have been taken over by other less technical doctrines - intention to create legal relations, duress etc. Consideration is incredibly wide in scope. The doctrine of consideration has not always been essential to contracts. Roman law contracts function without consideration. Up until the renaissance at the earliest, most contracts were done as debt on a bond or through a writ of covenant, both of which were one-way obligations.  Perhaps the most significant role of consideration left, in my view, has to do with its effect on equitable remedies.|`|CowgOqXTaa	Such as who? <br>  <br>  I've never heard such an argument, and I think it would be ridiculous.

iIJm5JToaa	what did she smoke?  Kids don't go through withdrawl from nicotine or weed, my Dr. told me not to quit completly while I was prego (the cigarettes, I didn't smoke the other stuff!) because it would be too stressful.   There must have been other factors involved, and typically a woman who would smoke pot while prego and have it come to the attention of her Dr. has other issues going on, to the point where someone felt the need to get child services involved.  It's not like the Dr. said "oh, lets drug test you today for marijuana".  <br>  <br>  Whatever she was smoking was addictive and paced throught the placenta,if she told you they said her baby had withdrawls from weed, she's feeding you a line.<br>  <br>  They could take the baby away if she's getting drug tests already.  That's usually a last resort, but they will keep visiting, checking up, etc.  Find out the name of the social worker, then contact them.  If you have a stable living enviroment, if may be an option for you to take the baby.<br>  <br>  And the way social services looks at weed is the same as any other drug, they see them all equally as bad (stupid yes, but true)|`|OYG8vWhSaa	If they take the child, your sister can recommend you take custody. They will probably listen, but you will have to have a homestudy done. You can have one done in advance and have yourself listed as an emergency care situation if you want- they might offer you other children to emergency care but you don't have to take them. You can just be your sister's alternate care provider.<br>  *This is true for most states. Contact child services in your area for more information and to get the ball rolling.|`|bwyBXDMHaa	If they do find drugs she will most likely go to jail for a couple of days and be charged serious fines. the baby will most likely go to a foster home for a while unless you are legally able to take care and provide for the baby. In other words you can't take care of it unless you are over 18 and have a job.|`|AA10832514	They will probably take the baby.  They are most likely going to be receptive to letting a family member take the child while they investigate and get help for your sister.  They would have to investigate you to make sure that you are considered acceptable, but I'm confident that you'll have good luck taking the baby to help your sister.|`|htD82ij1aa	i don't know exactly what they will do, but if they do take the kid, you should be able to take custody of it, on the condition that you are clean can financially support it and have a place for the baby to sleep.  at least that is what happened to this woman my mom knows who's sister couldn't care for her kids, we gave her a bed cause she needed proof she had a place for her nephew.|`|rbloxE6paa	if you're in the UK, your sister's baby will not be taken away from her!!<br>  the only way that would happen is if she's neglecting the child etc etc. smoking weed is not a reason on it's own for a child to be taken|`|PSxednsYaa	if you can provide a good home for the child you are the best canidate to get her at least on a short term basis, then maybe on a longer one. when my mother was having "other" problems my aunt took care of me when i was merely a month old until my ma got help and got better. since you are immediate family to the child its better than she go to a total stranger. plus it keeps her OUT of the majorly flawed system. any good CS rep will know this already|`|5zJmqpMPaa	social services could take the kid away until your sister cleans up her act. you could get custody but it would have to be approved.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	If the baby is taken from your sister, it would go to foster care.  You would have to apply for custody.  Most likely your sister would be given the option to go to rehab and counseling, and if she can keep clean UAs for a certain period of time then she can have custody again.  It's unlikely you would wind up with custody unless your sister keeps screwing up for a long period of time.

Also, best bet since Military regulations ususally look negitively on unauthorized individuals wearing military uniforms, is to have a replica made up sans insignia and even the eagle globe and anchor buttons(don't worry most of the guests will be too far away to distinguish a brass button from the official ones). The most important thing though is to focus on details. I'm not a Marine, and although most guests would understand it, I would be offended if I was an NCO in the Corps and I heard that you put a blood stripe on his pants. I would feel that I had worked hard to earn it and would be outraged that you relegated it to a level of "cuteness"! I would see it as an insult basically and if you went ahead with it I will sympathize with any Marine NCO that finds it offensive.<br>  Again, the details are important.

Even if they have a legal backround, not too many people are going to know this kind of law off the top of their head.  <br>  you will also have to look into the reason the defendants gave for the plaintiff's not having the right to a jury trial.<br>  if you are in law school you should have plenty of resources. If you aren't, try WesLaw or Find Law, both are online legal sites.  Better yet, go to the nearest law library and just ask.  The librarians there are usually very educated and love to help.  Good luck!

They go door to door and get people involved who wouldn't otherwise be interested.  They go to colleges and get young adults interested in politics.  They motivate young people to make a difference.  They help the elderly and poor to get to the polls.<br>  <br>  The Democratic party sometimes goes too far when registering people to vote and offering meals and transportation to people as an incentive.  I live in a large city and have personally been offered these things.  Also, this past election, I knew of two mothers who were having a difficult time explaining to the minor children that they couldn't vote (ACORN registered them and told them they could).  One of the kids was 14 years old.<br>  <br>  I realize that ACORN is not the Democratic party but I think we can all agree that they are completely entangled with one another.  On a personal level, I cannot count how many times I was approached by ACORN last year and each time they were promoting the Democratic party.

That's nothing less than hypocritical. Further, she did NOT make a fool out of her mother because she made a mistake and kept the baby instead of aborting it like you liberals would prefer her do but yet would fight anyone suggesting that the inner city kids, who continue to have babies they can't take care of, should.<br>  <br>  I bet you didn't find CNN's coverage of Obama: The New Lincoln marathon on Presidents' Day strange, did you?|`|ljRE5MeAaa	HHMMM...

Its worth about 250 K and I owe about 69 K on it.<br>  <br>  I see people around me that make half of what I do, some owe more on their houses than they paid for it.  Many are now mad cause they had only bought it to flip it.  Several now are doing all they can to see how they can get on board with a bail out.<br>  <br>  I have even asked a couple of them how they can expect the government to pay for stuff they can't afford.  I use the example "If I went to a casino and lost my pay check, should someone bail me out and give the money back?"<br>  <br>  They always respond that is different and that for them to have to pay back the money for they house they lost money on is not "fair" and someone needs to help them.<br>  <br>  Entitlement Mentality is out of control in this country.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Banks have gone from lending money to anyone at outrageous rates that they knew individuals couldn't afford to pay back to not lending money to anyone.

6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	According to Pro. George Mendenhal, author of "The Tenth Generation", this nation and its current political system is in its "death throes" as you put it.<br>  <br>  The current members of this society have totally lost touch with the original ideals of the founders of this once great nation to such an extent that the nation as it was founded no longer exist.<br>  <br>  When the final death throes and the final shudder occur, it is very likely that the identifying and political pendulum will swing to a radical extreme in response to its sense of being attacked.<br>  <br>  Such changes are called revolutions and are often bloody and very violent.  They give rise to governments that propose the ability to "fix" things (that is not the people fixing things but the government...), they identify a common enemy as a focus of hate and to bring the citizens together in the practice of that hate, they begin a purge of all those thought to be enemies of and within the state and it can take a long while before things and events calm down and a more rational and sane society emerges.<br>  <br>  Examples of this might be the fall of the Roman Empire and the turmoil in Europe that ensued, the French Revolution and the invention of the guillotine, the Russian Revolution and the purges by Lenin and Stalin, the rise of Communist or Red China under Chariman Mao with the advent of the Red Guard and now, what may be drastic, dramatic and dangerous changes, although necessary, in the United States as well as possibly throughout Western Europe and those nations that foolishly followed the Western ideals of un regulated capitalism and an immoral/amoral sense of ethics which says if you don't get caught it isn't wrong and everything is equal in validity and worth as the same have been promoted by the USA.<br>  <br>  There are answers and solutions to the many problems we and others are now facing,very few person will want to face and deal with the same as the current administration is making so painfully obvious by its failure to make the truly hard choices so as to correct obvious errors, mistakes and a system that has destroyed itself.  You might read that last statement as cowards don't make good heroes, only good patsies.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the privileged few, the bankers and investment manipulators, the politicians who reside in their pockets and the lawyers will be the first to go if the French revolution is any example...which will include "Uncle Dick" and "little George".|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Considering 46-48% of the popular vote was for McCain.

Obviously, the viewers don't get real facts.  So far they've used the following- socialist, communist (which is it?  can't be both), terrorist Muslim, messiah, space alien, satan, and the list goes on.  Obviously, true journalists would not use such terms, and anyone who watches that kind of garbage isn't too sharp.  This is why no one takes the Republican party seriously anymore.|`|Pv9ALQfpaa	Not that I personally call him a Marxist... however, I do know it's not about what he says as it is about what he does... Everytime you support something that allows Government control over peoples lives and choices and things that allow people's sense of entitlement to grow... People will consider that Socialist and Marxist...<br>  <br>  Vermin, then there are millions of deranged folk out there then, because Fox News tops ratings all the time... even above CNN and Network Media.|`|bkav003oaa	Of course he is not a marxist!<br>  <br>  Everyone who calls him that is ignorant. <br>  And for those who call for him to back up his words with action - do you want him to invade another sovereign nation?

But he IS a Pinko.  A Pinko is someone who's weakness and proclivity toward collectivism enables the full-blown Leninists like you guys to gain ground.  Pinko's don't engage in the revolt, but they do collaborate, and therefore must be imprisoned with the commies. But just because Obama is a Pinko doesn't mean that he can't be involved in nationalist conflict with other Leftists.  You guys have a long history of that.  Tito vs Stalin. Mao vs Khruschev.  Didn't your peeps take notes when it was all happening?  You have to rely on Capitalists to explain it to you?|`|ciQFlpuLaa	well, Bill Clinton had a lot of harsh words for Al-Qaeda when they bombed the USS Cole, but he took no action!! in 1996, Clinton actually had the chance to capture Osama Bin Laden. the Libyans offered Bin Laden to the CIA, but Clinton turned them down!! the bottom line is that actions speak louder than words.|`|WiFQbtgIaa	Apparently Obama hadn't had Michelle's special koolaid yet.<br>  <br>  Every time The Obama opens his mouth I (and everyone else) lose 1-2% from my(our) 401(k)!<br>  <br>  He is a freaking genius when it comes to collapsing an economy and destroying people lives.|`|9182deb49d35088f0fbc109ddd6a4670aa	words vs action. remember everyone loved mussolini in the beginning. this is still the beginning. just sit back and watch. see what happens.|`|iDq0PuSfaa	It totally depends on which side of his mouth you are listening to.|`|ZFEtrB39aa	I only watch fox news for the legs.|`|x5tTzjhCaa	Obama is a commie..... we need to stop socialism!|`|HZ9YfIMOaa	And Soviet Union once went to war with China. Obama might not be a far-leftist, but his views are still leftist.|`|YupMCYHlaa	The Republicans are mad as hell that Obama won.  They practically invented overblown rhetoric, political hype.<br>  <br>  For years and years the Republicans used the word 'liberal' for anything they didn't like or anyone they disagreed with.  Newt Gingrich called President Clinton 'the most liberal president in US history'.  You'd expect more from a guy who has a PhD in American history, a Gingrich does.  All he really meant was that he really really didn't like Clinton.<br>  <br>  Finally the L-word completely lost its meaning.  So now they say 'communist', 'marxist', 'stalinist', 'socialist'.  The words are all interchangeable.  Anyone who calls Obama a marxist is showing that either he doesn't really understand Obama at all or he doesn't know what marxism is.  It's just a bad word, so Obama must be one.<br>  <br>  The Republicans are throwing everything they have at Obama.  They desperately want him to fail, no matter how much damage it does to the country, so they can blame all our problems on him and get back into control.  Their strategy has always been to win at any cost.  They don't have any good alternative ideas, so all they can do is criticize Obama and obstruct whatever he wants.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Those who do so are idiots and red baiters.

Initially the government create a temporary job for an electrician  for wiring a new government building but after the building has been complete the electrician  will be out of a job again!<br>  <br>  Before we can Create a green economy, we need to educate a green workforce. My main question regards are their enough people to educated the workers of a new green economy. It will take a number of years before we can fully educate and train Americans for green jobs. which means only a select few can be qualified to work for a green company created by the stimulus!|`|jAgH5ewfaa	They will be government jobs mostly, given to deadbeats who voted for Obunghole.

AhlWfUpXaa	The 'spirit' of gun laws are to keep them out of the hands of children, criminals, and the mentally incompetent. Unfortunately people being people will always think of 'creative' ways to go around the laws.  This doesn't mean that there shouldn't be laws though.<br>  <br>  I personally believe every adult has a 'natural law' entitlement to protect themselves from harm with the use of guns, and criminals that use guns to harm\kill should be executed.  Those that traffic guns illegally should also face the same fate.  For these criminals it seems only extreme punishment will deter them from gun violence.|`|d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	Criminals, by definition, break laws.  Should we make theft legal because shoplifters aren't going to obey the law, anyway?  The criminal law exists so that those who break them can be punished.<br>  <br>  If we suddenly couldn't punish (or even take the gun from) every dangerous felon, gang-banging teen, or mentally disturbed person; and couldn't stop any underground gun runners from selling guns to any of them, the problem would only be worse.  Just imagine the Russian mafia selling VSSes out of the back of truck in broad daylight on your street corner.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	The Constitution says we have the right to bear arms. It is the same as any other law. People break laws. That is why we have Police to enforce the laws. Criminals get their guns illegally anyway. Not everyone follows the laws. But if they are caught they are punished.|`|AA11464317	In simple terms, laws in general exist so that courts will have a legal right to prosecute lawbreakers. Laws also have a deterrent effect on people who consider activities which might be breaking the law.|`|DP0AjzJ2aa	Because they are criminals and don't obey the law.  <br>  <br>  The law is set for people who want to own and shoot guns.  Criminals and anyone convicted  of a violent crime will never be able to own a gun legally.  That's why they do it illegally.  They make it difficult for responsible gun owners. The majority of crimes commited with guns are from people who aren't supposed to have them.|`|e5229cd398fab1a52d67a832b2db54c1aa	I guess for the same reason there is no common-courtesy for drivers anymore.<br>  <br>  I see everybody in a mad rush while driving and they don't seem to care how many people they have to run over as long as they get where they are going.<br>  <br>  You almost never see anyone using turn signals anymore!<br>  <br>  They pass on the right, they run red-lights, they tail-gate, they use profanity constantly, and use nasty gestures and there's never a cop around to patrol the streets and enforce the laws anymore.<br>  <br>  I guess Winchell's are gone so Starbuck's are the police Dept's new hangout!<br>  <br>  .|`|zPfgFXU5aa	The reason is so they can prosecute them when they break those gun laws.<br>  <br>  if the gun laws didn't exist then the criminals would not legally be doing anything wrong and there would be no grounds on which to arrest them for firearms offences.|`|d5e5e5f996fff98a238592434f2a6d7aaa	Unfortunately, laws ARE written for criminals. It wasn't the original intention but that is how it is.|`|jAgH5ewfaa	They make gun laws so the law-abiding citizen can't defend himself against criminals who wish to steal and kill.<br>  Makes a lot of sense doesn't it!|`|9b5935684568a7cb72fa426091885e25aa	It is the law that separates us from the criminals they choose to break we choose to keep the law helps us not to cross the threshold and mess up cause we consider the consequences|`|VSmQWuhEaa	Gun laws represent one thing. And it is not safety, nor peace, it is Control.|`|AA11450062	Your right we should get rid of speed limits too. lol|`|VmE3Viycaa	DC actually has the highest murder rate with firearms. it is because criminals there know that you don't have a gun. if the law made stricter regulations on gun ownership there would only result with higher murder rates. the problem isn't the guns the government knows about. it's the guns that are unregistered and will still be in existence when all others are not. it has been the same story in the UK and in Australia.  statistically in the USA a doctor is 9,000 times more likely to kill someone than a gun owner. maybe we should put restrictions on who can be a doctor. also just put a more undesired punishment for those involved with illegal gun activity. so those of us with guns who obey the law won't be punished.|`|5ac40eaae3a66dcd680cf6c728f414adaa	If they didn't break the law, the wouldn't be criminals, would they?<br>  <br>  The very act of doing (or not doing, in your case) something makes them something else depending on the condition of your statement.<br>  ----------<br>  Gun laws are poorly enforced, so it's easy to pass a law as a response to a tragedy/condition instead of actually carrying out the law.  Also the social environment is violent and seems irrational to deliberately allow oneself to become a victim - particularly when arms are so-o-o easy to buy.  Add identity+adrenaline-addiction reasons and the law becomes irrelevant: i.e., peer pressure and personal affinity, power image, danger, excitement, sex, macho image...|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,<br>  <br>  It is kind of like telling a child NOT to play with matches.

If he voluntarily signed that he was the father, it would have waived the requirement (see Court Procedures for Obtaining Child Support). What mom did was pretty sketchy, but if he voluntarily signed, that's how they could require support without the DNA testing. <br>  <br>  I'd agree visitation would be fairly automatic so the paperwork should be a formality.

The liberal democrats learned long ago that minorities and the poor are a huge voting block that typically take positions from the media.  The democrats learned that if they can keep the status quo for these groups of people--(give em not enough to bring em out of the class they are in but enough to make them dependant) you can keep this voting block for decades.  Prime example-LBJ's great society--in the years before the great society black businesses were expanding rapidly--the black community at large was experiencing growth which would have taken many poor blacks out of economic disadvantge--waltz in with the great society--in which we started among many things paying people to have children under circumstances ensured to keep the father out of the house.  This action was particularly targeted at the black population who in the mid 50's were matriachal in nature anyway.  This wasn't done out of love of fellow man--this was done by liberal democrats to keep a voting block.|`|724634aa550e4f2aa216e83840f9e8a4aa	Oppression is usually found in socialistic societies... so would be far from a republican..<br>  <br>   Check 1950 to 1980's Soviet Union, Cuba etc..<br>  <br>  My advice is to stop skipping school before you post.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	If you only let me choose from among your detractors, the opposition party, I assume you believe in...<br>  <br>  Tyrannical Socialism|`|noo8vpvzaa	Welfare<br>  <br>  Socialism|`|ZZZgZ764aa	Capitalism rewards those who create businesses and work hard.

CUVYxMF1aa	The kids I know that homeschooled turned out to be highly educated, good citizens and are contributing to society.|`|7992aa6b297d96f8bc84f450dab331c3aa	My personal experience with homeschooled kids is this:<br>  <br>  1)  They are usually smarter/better educated than average.  I don't know if this has more to do with smart parents who are good teachers or if it's the method of homeschooling producing a more interactive learning experience or what, but they just seem smarter on average.<br>  <br>  2)  They usually come out socially retarded.  I would say that 9 out of every 10 homeschooled kids I know or have known were just really awkward in social situations.  I think you can mostly chalk this up to the fact that they are spending a lot of time at home with their family or a small group of kids instead of getting daily interaction with 50 or 100 or even more kids.  Like with any other skill, kids who spend years worth of time interacting with other kids just understand how to do it.<br>  <br>  My advice (as someone who wasn't homeschooled and doesn't have any kids yet, take it for what it's worth) is that if you decide on homeschooling, you MUST enroll your child into multiple activities or extra classes for the duration of the homeschooling.  Ideally, find team sports for them (Football, Soccer, Basketball, Baseball) and maybe some other kind of group activity, like Boy Scouts.  For girls, maybe try dance as well.  I know more about the guys side of things, but either way the goal is that they need to have regular interactions with dozens of kids or they don't figure out social skills.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision!  I know any parent who evaluates home schooling as an option cares about the education and success of their child, and wants the very best for them.|`|AA11179275	I feel really bad for children who are home schooled for religious reasons. (which is the #1 reason parents decide to homeschool children) I think its important for children to learn how to socialize, and deal with others, and would be missing out on a lot. I do understand if parents need to home school their children for reasons such as learning disability, slow development, etc.|`|80Dyljhdaa	I was home-schooled, while most home scholars excel in  english and reading comprehension, there's no way to teach math on  the level that could be attained at a public school, and math is vital in this day and age.|`|EzNxSIVeaa	For some families it works very well.  A friend of mine homeschooled all six of her kids and stepkids.  The youngest is graduating high school this year and will be entering college.  The others are either finishing college or set in nice careers.|`|5W2rEsvFaa	Considering Ed Balls is intent on destroying all British schools, I think it is a good option!<br>  <br>  Oh Im sorry Brownites, did I upset you with the truth of your Precious PM's henchmans failiure!!

I still had friends in regular classes, so I got invited to all the activities and things. I am greatful I had homeschooling throughout jr high and high school...I graduated early (at 15) and with honors, and I was able to gain a greater sense of responsibility while being in charge of my own work! I think home school is a great benifit in our education system. Just make sure it is right for your child. I was one who needed to be away from the distractions of a classroom, and so it worked out for me great. Just weight all your options!|`|bo2hvFR4aa	HOMESCHOOL iS GREAT BUT i FOR ONE WOULD LiKE TO GO TO REGULAR SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU CAN MEET NEW PEOPLE THEiR AND PLUS LEARN ALOT MORE ABOUT YOURSELF AND PLENTY OTHER NEW PEOPLE !|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Sad just sad. You don't pick up all the bad habits you do in public school but you miss out on a lot of life lessons too that can only be gained through experience.<br>  <br>  So my parents picked the middle road for me and sent me to a private school and for my senior year they sent me to something close to a public school haha.|`|3UTlASavaa	A very broad question.  The answers that you have received indicate the variety of homeschooling environments.  We have homeschooled our kids and have been very happy with the results.  Our kids are well adjusted, do well in social situations, and do excel in the classroom (they are now beginning to enter into high school classes through a cooperative program with our local school system).<br>  <br>  If the parents do not reach out to other homeschooled families the kids can suffer from a lack of interaction with peers.  On the other hand, we have a large and active homeschool community in our area and we have been able to tap into many opportunities for our kids to have interaction with a wide age range and cultural milieu which has worked better than traditional school.  I also am thrilled to see how the kids interact with adults, peers and younger children.  They are far more adept in all situations than their peers.<br>  <br>  Academically they are far ahead of their peers.  It is a great way to go if you can put the time into it.  It is a terrible choice if you are unprepared to manage the process.  If it takes a full time teacher to plan curriculum and teach classes why do parents think that it can be done in two hours a day?|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	Overall home school students seem to outperform traditional school students.  This may be due to more home school parents generally being well  educated and very dedicated to their child's education needs than average parents.  <br>  <br>  I know its working well for my friends who have a child with attention deficit.  He finds it much easier to work at home with his mother and of course she can give him one on one attention.  I'm not sure how it will work when he is older and the work is more complex.<br>  <br>  I would say she finds it a little challenging to find good social interactions for him.  Not many families in their area home school so there are very few groups set up for activities.  That's the biggest down side so far, I think.|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	I love it and I do it. My son is 7 and is now working on 2 digit mulitiplication and division. He reads on a 12 year old level and rocks in science. Here in FL you can pay for a child to attend a private school for one or two days a week. So on Fridays he goes to private school for PE and for Art. <br>  <br>  He loves being home schooled and he participates in plenty of activities for social reasons. Personally I think the excuse to send a child to school for social reasons is foolish. They are there to learn not to socialize.|`|heCuvfPSaa	I think it's ok for collage but for little kids I think they should be in school to  meet knew people|`|SjTAVdcKaa	Best way to go these days.

Also, it IS February...Black History Month....remember?<br>  <br>  Reading is fundamental!<br>  Per your OWN link:<br>  <br>  Background:<br>  One Hundred Black Men of America, Inc. was created in 1963 with the founding of its first chapter in New York in 1967.  The organization's hope was to make a difference in the lives of African-American youth and the idea quickly caught on with independent chapters forming across the nation. There are currently 80 chapters and 10,000 members with the mission remaining the same- to improve the quality of life for African American communities by improving the educational, economic and social status of African-Americans across the nation.|`|AA10698792	Because the are not discriminating against anyone or expressing any kind of hate based on any race.<br>  <br>  The group was formed in support of Black men and not to disparage anyone else.<br>  <br>  If they were to have non-black applicants and not let them in based upon their race, then they would probably be considered racist.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Because they are black.<br>  Anyone who doesn't "get" that is obtuse.<br>  <br>  Edit:  mrjoness.....you point out "every minority group".

They can do whatever they please without fear of repercussions. The minute someone says something about the group they are a racist.<br>  It is ironic that the African Americans can have their exclusive groups, but you let a white person make a group and not include at least one African American, and it is considered a hate group, that is out to wipe the black man off the map.<br>  It is the same thing with Roland Burris, calling Harry Reid a racist because Reid, refused to allow him to be sworn in with the other new members of the Senate. It was over the fact that Burris didn't have a paper signed by the head of the Illinois State Senate.<br>  Burris is the one who had the group of journalists along with him as he threatened to sue Reid and the government.|`|vSRhp7zxaa	We have groups of Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans, Polish-Americans, and dozens of others.

It promotes ethnic pride, not hatred of other races.  I'm white, and I used to go to their events in a town I used to live in.

If you don't believe me, consider that:<br>  <br>  Newt Gingrich is the main person during the Clinton years who helped to balance the budget.  He is extremely intelligent and knows how to handle the government from many different angles.  You should hope that he doesn't get the nomination in 2012 because he will be a formidable opponent.  He knows the true meaning of bi-partisanship.<br>  <br>  Petraeus knows the military.  If we are still in Iraq and Afghanistan in four years (and we probably will be), he will definitely know how to beat the enemy and bring our troops home in victory.  Instead of being just a general who still has to take orders from the Pentagon, he will be the Commander-in-Chief.  Since he has proven that he is an excellent military strategist, I am sure that he will handle all other areas of government with ease.<br>  <br>  The other people aren't even a consideration for me.

It is not about Christianity (however you might define "official" USA religion) helping Islam. It is about much higher political deals.<br>  <br>  The people in USA (voting mass) were heavily influenced by the media manipulation aimed at driving the public opinion toward intervention. It is peculiar that the most important part of this episode was played by Ruder Fin, a Jewish media corporation which compared Serbs toward Bosnian Muslims to Germans toward Jews.<br>  <br>  What went on in Bosnia was that USA and Germany (Warren Zimmerman) pushed the Bosnian Muslims into war against Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs, Bosian Croats and Bosnian Muslims had previously reached a peace agreement (Jose Cutileiro Swiss type confederation plan). NATO practically used Bosnian Muslims as carnage against Serbs who engaged fighting back, and the war consisted in draining Serbs until surrender. The war ended less favorable to Bosnian Muslims than if they had accepted the Jose Cutileiro's peace plan. Bad luck. This great YouTube video explains the issue very well:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkHp_0SxTQQ&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkHp_0SxT...</a><br>  <br>  The war in Bosnia is not about catching and beheading fugitive Serbs around the globe because they lost a war against USA. It is about the death of 100,000 people. It is about an unnecessary war in which we all have been dipped into.<br>  <br>  To me Karadzic is a sad hero of the war in Bosnia. He led Bosnian Serbs against the bloody Germans, Americans and their dark angels. You will achieve nothing in Hague. The Truth of history will hunt down your children. They will ask you if all that bloodshed was necessary.<br>  <br>  I hope you people stop playing the "official victims" and figure who your real enemy is. If you perceive that your real enemy is your next door neighbor, then I wish you another bloody war in the near future.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  The argument: "Our mission is to keep peace." is the death and destruction way USA brings where ever it decides to play the "world policeman". The "peacekeeping" indoctrination is such a powerful weapon of mass control that people in USA actually believe in it.<br>  <br>  The civil war in Yugoslavia was ignited and escalated all the way through by Germany and USA. It brought 130,000 deaths, 20 tons of depleted uranium and hundreds of billions of dollars of destruction and misery. It was a war which could have been avoided.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I realize that there is a huge problem there.  However, that problem is 600 hundred years old and I doubt if we can solve it.

We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom -- and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.<br>  <br>  To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required -- not because the Communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right.

HmU1UqSeaa	There is a great deal of misunderstanding of the nature<br>  of anarchism.<br>  <br>  Anarchists (also known as libertarians or libertarian<br>  socialists, in the original sense of socialism as worker-<br>  ownership-and-control of the means of production)<br>  oppose illegitimate authority and hierarchy, and therefore<br>  oppose capitalism and the state; anarchists do not oppose<br>  all organization: anarchists favor voluntary, non-<br>  hierarchical, self-organization. Anarchists do not oppose<br>  all rules and laws; anarchists oppose rules and laws<br>  imposed involuntarily by illegitimate authorities, such<br>  as the state, and favor voluntarily-agreed-upon rules and<br>  laws.<br>  <br>  "Anarchy 101", an excellent introduction to anarchism,<br>  can be found here:<br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2fq4d2" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2fq4d2</a><br>  <br>  "An Anarchist FAQ", giving an in-depth treatment of<br>  anarchism, can be found here:<br>  <a href="http://www.anarchistfaq.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anarchistfaq.org/</a><br>  <br>  *****<br>  <br>  News & Views for Anarchists & Activists:<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/smygo/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/smygo/</a>|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	um...."voting for anarchy" is like "screwing for abstinence".....|`|gQYIphZtaa	I wish all the people that think they could survive a Jungle like society because they have a gun,could get what they want just for a week.<br>   Their are a whole lot of people that talk that self reliant speech that would not survive if Daddy and American laws didn't protect them and give them opportunity.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	We would of been an anarchy if it wasn't for George Washington.

Afghanistan is mostly the same story, except there are some concerns about it being a stronghold for al-Qaeda.  While we shouldn't occupy a country, we absolutely should do what we can to destroy that organization.<br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer your question more directly, it is foolishness for us to be spending so much money on keeping our troops abroad when most of them are not being used in a way that advances our interests.

All you have to do is look at the actual video footage of these liberals defending Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae when Republicans were begging for more regulation on them in 2004.<br>  <br>  Democrats...one after the other....getting upset and stating that there is absolutely no problem at all.

What freaking cave have you been living in the last 8 years? Everything that Bush screwed up you REPUBLISCUMS blamed Clinton.

Why not? You REPUBLISCUMS still blame Clinton for everything from the War of 1812 to, as I have heard, this current economic crisis.<br>  <br>  Why even the Drug Addict gasbag, El Drug Bo has suggested that the current crisis got deeper because Obama won the election.<br>  <br>  Here is a novel idea.

You should pat yourself on the back.|`|IFVrLCNOaa	Because the average American does not know the facts. They listen to media sound bites. <br>  <br>  Bill Clinton signed the CRA amendments which encouraged lending those who were high credit risks in the name of socioeconomic and race relations. This is the principal reason that the urban areas are seeing so many foreclosures. The idea that people without money have to own their own homes as opposed to renting is the root of the issue. The truth is no one 'owns' their home until it is paid in full.<br>  Take Habitat for Humanity for instance... In my area, they have bought land and constructed homes for people who couldn't even pay their rent. If you can't afford to pay rent, how can you pay for a mortgage?<br>  This is the redistribution of wealth. They take from the haves and give to the have nots. The problem with the Robin Hood mentality is that they take from the good people and they take from people who aren't rich.|`|hMLmrPbgaa	"...the notion that the Community Reinvestment Act is somehow responsible for poor lending decisions is absurd.<br>  <br>  Here's why.<br>  <br>  The  Community Reinvestment Act  applies to depository banks. But many of the institutions that spurred the massive growth of the subprime market weren't regulated banks. They were outfits such as Argent and American Home Mortgage, which were generally not regulated by the Federal Reserve or other entities that monitored compliance with CRA. These institutions worked hand in glove with Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, entities to which the CRA likewise didn't apply...<br>  <br>  ...the CRA didn't force mortgage companies to offer loans for no-money down, or to throw underwriting standards out the window, or to encourage mortgage brokers to aggressively seek out new markets. Nor did the CRA force the credit-rating agencies to slap high-grade ratings on subprime debt..."|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	Because they just love to bash bush.

However, Clinton still supports Grahmm-Leach and disagrees that the deregulation is policy the cause.  If it was Europe would have first been hit with the mess since the banks never had Glass-Stegall regulations. Under Bush, regulations actually increased with the passing of Sarbanes-Oxley.   <br>  <br>  People also blame predatory lending which is the practice of charging more for the same loan because the applicant does not have good credit.  This made loans more expensive and the laws of economics tell us that probably decreased the overall number of loans.  In this case a good thing.|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	Why are you grossly generalizing the entire party?  <br>  <br>  I don't think it has anything to do with the Clinton years, but you still cant blame it all on one party.|`|AA10331255	They will never man up.  They will blame Bush forever.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Unka Dano is incorrect in the assertation that the Conservative principal of deregulation had failed.<br>  <br>  The current mess is the result of excess regulation since the deregulation attempts did not remove ALL of it (it removed the band-aid on the underlying problems stemming from over-regulation).|`|V4BaRBtnaa	actually, your info is a bit inaccurate. The CRA was only applicable to banks that accepted cash deposits in target communities. The bulk of sub prime mortgages were made by mortgage brokers who were exempt from the CRA. This is a fact.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Fair enough, but for many years after that the economy did just fine.

"<br>  <br>  I rest my case. I wonder where the evidence for this claim comes from. What study is that based on? By this theory we can all thank the polices od Jimmy Carter for the economic boom of the mid-1980's.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Nice way to approach a gigantic problem - focus on just one aspect.  We could go all the way back to Ronald Reagan and his trickle-down economy.  Or we could go back even further to 1913 and the creation of the fed and the Constitutional Amendment allowing the income tax.  <br>  <br>  The Republicans and Democrats of the last 20 years were just the final nails in the coffin for a death that really occurred over 90 years ago.<br>  <br>  And Greg, got any video of the Republican-controlled finance committee refusing to ever let the bill get to the floor?  It's much easier to blame Democratic speechifying rather than a Republican Congress that was controlled by the banking industry, who WANTED the sub-prime loans because they were planning to make them into a cash cow.
325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	I'm 35 and I just enlisted recently.  I'm still in DEP, in the National Guard (probably going to switch to active army after AIT.)  <br>  <br>  So far all I've done is RSP, which is unique to the National Guard.  Basically it's a prep course for basic, which you do one weekend a month.  <br>  <br>  When we did our PT at RSP, the two top performers were both over 30.  The Sgt said that was not uncommon, because by the time people hit 30, they know they have to exercise to stay in shape.  A lot of the kids in there, their last exercise was playing Wii Sports for half an hour at their last kegger.  <br>  <br>  People will look to you for answers because you are a grown up.  The Sgt will also call on you a lot for little jobs for the same reason.  I haven't gotten a nickname yet, but I'm sure something like "gramps" is coming along soon.  One guy called me "Mr Miyagi" cause I'm ancient at 35 and I used to teach karate.  I hope that one doesn't stick, but what can you do?<br>  <br>  As long as you're fit, you should be fine.  Feel free to email me if you have any questions about the enlistment process.|`|UHBbSeesaa	I am 35,<br>  been in for 3 years now.<br>  It can be alittle more taxing phisically but...

It was and is good times.<br>  <br>  Go for it,  the nicknamed me   "crutches" hehe I don't know why?|`|ikVeexNWaa	My husband and I are prior service so your experience might be different. My husband went back in 2 years ago (after a 5 years break) at the age of 41 (got out after having served 15 yrs on AD - Active Duty). He is doing quite well although somewhat frustrated by the immaturity of the our younger soldiers who outrank him. I just try to remind him that we were just like that when we were younger. He seems to be really happy with his choice to return to AD.<br>  <br>  As for me I am in the process of getting my paperwork together with the recruiter and seeing my options. I am 38 and unsure of what to do at this point. Reality for me is the military is the only life I know. I only did 3 years active and switched to reserves (for 12 years) to be home with our children(3 teen boys now). I've been completely out for only 4 years. So like my husband I have to do a refresher BT course (4 weeks long). <br>  <br>  My advice to you is go for it if it's what you really want. In seeking advice, remember, that it is only advice. Consider all the advice you were given and (if married w/children) how your family feels and then make the decision (with your family included) that is best you and your family. At the end of the day you (and your family) are the only one(s) who has to live with the choice you make. Hope this helps.

Now if you were drunk and threatening to blow up the building and kill everyone inside I could see the need for such drastic force, but you were attacked for expressing your opinion.<br>  <br>  Make no mistake, this is not part of a "vast right wing conspiracy" or "the new Republican Party."

But the obvious purpose for his attendance was to disrupt and protest someone who he disagreed with.  <br>  <br>  Ms. Coulter has been attacked (literally) by supposedly well mannered protesters, so much so that she now requires security.<br>  I doubt this person would have been manhandled if he merely left of his own volition.  <br>  <br>  But without seeing or hearing what he said to her, I could also be a staged incident intended to glorify him and demonize her.|`|nz8U5rNaaa	Well sounds bad, but if you go looking for trouble you usually find it. Getting in line to have a book signed when you don't have a book so you can confront her is a dangerous thing to do. She has many threats on her life and the police will not take any chances. If that is the whole and true story then they have a case to have it checked into, but I can see them getting nowhere with it.

2gx2LgzEaa	You can put a mint on a turd, but its still a turd...|`|YupMCYHlaa	The Republicans had their own ideas for stimulus.  They wanted more tax cuts for rich people.  President Obama's bill was about 1/3 tax cuts and 2/3 investment spending.  The Repubs wanted 2/3 tax cuts and 1/3 investment spending.<br>  <br>  But the Democrats saw (rightly I think) that it was tax cuts, skewed disproportionately towards the rich, that got us into this problem in the first place.  It's been proven since Reagan that tax cuts don't stimulate the economy enough to pay for themselves.<br>  <br>  Check out this chart:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/files/economic-benefits-of-stimul.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ourfuture.org/files/economic-...</a><br>  <br>  This was done by a top economic adviser of John McCain, for Moodys, which is a very conservative organization. It shows what -investments- in the US economy pay back the biggest returns. At the top are expansions in Food Stamps, infrastructure spending, aid to states.  All those things pay back more than we spend on them.  At the bottom are extending Bush's tax cuts, corporate tax cuts, etc.  Those things don't return what we spend on them.<br>  <br>  But no matter what Obama wants to do the Republicans are going to criticize it harshly and say it's just the worst thing he could do. If Obama changes his mind 180% the Republicans will criticize that too.  It's just how they work. It's how they worked with Clinton too.  Their deliberate strategy is not to cooperate with Democrats.  So the Democrats are just going to have to work around them if they want to get anything done.|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	They weren't allow to be in the negations.<br>  <br>  Democrats ram this through in the dead of night so no one can read it before it was pass.|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	They didn't want it in the first place.|`|GgG0inaUaa	They tried but where more or less shut out of the process.

It comes down to pure numbers.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Actually, the Democrats in the Senate finally had to add some things that the GOP wanted to get enough votes to pass the Senate.

BLMh0dG6aa	When the entire world economy collapses, and no business may buy or sell anything.<br>  <br>  Either that or we decide to end the stock market|`|AFqZEOlRaa	It can't.  For that to happen, every stock would have to be sold at a value of $0.  Since you can't sell anything for $0, it would have to at least have a value of 1 cent.  And since that would, as I said, require every stock to have that value, it ain't gonna happen.  Stocks that are up include Coca Cola, Campbell's Soup, Walmart, and McDonald's.  Or did you think that everything on the stock market was losing value?|`|AA11676794	It won't<br>  <br>  Back in October, I recall hearing a financial expert offer up the opinion that the market would drop about 40% (around 7800) stay there for 9 months to a year then slowly start building up again and that it would take about four years to return to its former level.<br>  <br>  Well we are at 40% and although it waivers each day it hast really gone down or up. So if he is correct we are looking at an 8000 dow until October/November then a slow and steady rise.|`|AA10008110	It seems like Obama has it headed there.  He has almost socialized General Electric, Citigroup, Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Exxon.|`|ZCrIKWlQaa	when nobody has any money in it or wants to put any in... not very likely...<br>  <br>  but an economy can still be successful without a stock market, so who cares?|`|k6hicodfaa	Never.|`|UZBULUuraa	At the rate it is going by the end of 2009. Obama predicts gloom and doom, and investors are obviously believing him. Since the election the stock market has been on a downward spiral and when he signed that terrible spending bill, it decided to tank again. Nothing Obama has done has allayed the fears of American investors. I hear it is near dipping below 7000 which would take it to about 49% of its July 2007level and worse than the aftermath of 9/11. With 47 months of Obama left America is in dire trouble. Obama is like a company taking the mail room clerk and promoting him to president of the company. It might have worked for Tim Robbins in "The Hudsucker Proxy" but it won't work in real life.|`|AA11593583	Never. Even at the height of the "great depression" it wasn't zero.<br>  <br>  But what will the bottom turn out to be? I don't know. Why would I know.

What grade are you in, anyhow?
t3QAaSN9aa	Yes.  So many want to pretend that racism does not exist in this country, for reasons of their own.  Many racists think that they can criticize and disparage African Americans by pretending that there is no discrimination and that there has never been any discrimination.  That way, they can criticize African Americans for not having achieved parity in this society on the basis of some inherent character flaw. Of course, it doesn't work but they try endlessly. <br>  <br>  As for the Senate seat, we African Americans have 1 Senator out of 100, although we represent 13% of the population.  Yet, you complain about it? Give it a rest for crying out loud.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	In this age of minority pandering, I wear the "racist" badge with honor because I know that the only ones who use that term are racist themselves.|`|024e057726e56ac8f27fea7f5379e549aa	Racism is strongly encouraged in this administration, as you showed by those two examples. It is not acceptable though, for whites to promote their interests or defend their way of life. We`are being demanded to pay reparations in a million little ways and to become apologists for past generations misdeeds. I personally will continue to speak out on the disparity and duplicity, and will gladly take on the racist moniker if that is what it takes to defend my rights as an American citizen.|`|JP1o1ggZaa	It is racism if they said the Senate seat should go t a white person or the spending package only Go to skilled workers the NAACP and ACLU and our own president would be screaming about this and calling it racist. It is kind of funny that nobody seems to think that this is blatantly racist.  This is a classic example of reverse racism and a true sign as to the direction our country is going.|`|jfEjTjL6aa	boy your good we arent half as racist as afraid of being called racist by the folks who want it both ways separate and equal|`|Y3YLObM5aa	Those are racists remarks and the accusers seem to be the worst at what they accuse others of.....|`|GHPZlhAwaa	No, the vast majority of Americans believe that all people SHOULD be treated equally, not as to outcome, but as to opportunity and simply do not think about race.  Did blacks win civil rights in the 60's alone?  Did Barack "All my friends are crooks" Obama win the last presidential election solely by the black vote?   NO!, of course not, in a democracy a minority of 12% of the population can only win something with the strong concurrence of the remainder of the population.<br>  <br>  People's first concerns are themselves and their family, then their friends, then their community, then their state and then their country and then the world.  If we are unaware of problems that people in Alabama are having with race issues, why would we bring up those issue if we live in the Midwest?  We wouldn't until such time as issues came to our attention. <br>  <br>  Also, if you want us to take notice of legitimate racial concerns, you shouldn't claim racism at every perceived slight.  When the only time racism becomes an issue is when Reverend Al comes out and proclaims something as racist when he is clearly using the issue not to promote racial healing, but to promote Reverend Al. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.storyarts.org/library/aesops/stories/boy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.storyarts.org/library/aesops/...</a><br>  <br>  When the stories about the Reverend who cried racism are done, then we may listen to other saner voices who actually might have a real claim to be being discriminated against because of their race, but until then, when the Reverend Al cries wolf, we will just stop listening.<br>  <br>  I know that I had never met a black person, hispanic person or Jew until I was in High School and my parents or teachers had never discussed race with me, but when I run my restaurant, I don't give a flying hoot about your race, religion or sexual proclivities, I only care about 3 things: 1) Can you and will you do the job that I hire you to do?  2) Can you and will you cooperate and work as a team with the other employees?  3) Can you and will you help the company make a profit?  If the answer is yes, then I don't care what you look like or sound like on the outside, because those three answers tell me about the most important thing about the person inside, their character, and that is who I want to hire.<br>  <br>  Because we do not talk about race every day, or listen when moronic publicity seekers liker Reverend Al claim racism every other day, does not mean that the American PEOPLE are cowards.  When the issue comes up for debate, the Civil War, the march on Washington, the march to montgomery, the American people showed up and demanded that equal rights be guaranteed for all.  That is NOT cowardice.  Cowardice is making such a statement in a speech to your employees who are unable to respond for fear of losing their jobs.<br>  <br>  whale

You need to have policies that work.  So far, I don't see anything positive out of this administration.  I see a knee-jerk rejection of Bush's policies (except where cooler heads have prevailed) and I see Democratic political favors being provided to their supporters in the stimulus bill.<br>  <br>  So far this is unfortunately exactly what I thought would happen.  The Democrats have run up huge political debts in order to win the election and they are paying those debts off before they address anything that is wrong with the country and the economy.  I can only hope that they have hit the end of that list.  They are terribly inexperienced and are flailing about looking for someone to blame.  That is useless.  How much less broke am I if a Republican or a Democrat was responsible for the policy that made me broke?  Get out there and fix the problem and I will be able to move on.

Requiring them to work with today's money and not with that of future generations is just plain good sense.<br>  <br>  BTW: Thank you for giving me "best answer" on a different question.

02a3aa56f12facd0557c683d42ccc66baa	You gave no clear indication of when or where the test was administered. Was he canned from work at the unemployment office for failing the test or did he just go out and party it up after getting laid off or fired from another job for some other reason? <br>  The federal government has left it up to the states to decide whether or not to release state funds after drug testing.<br>  I would agree that that is a harsh penalty. However, unemployment insurance (at least in my state) usually requires some sort of an effort to find employment to continue to receive benefits. Having evidence of recent drug use would likely render him ineligible for any work until he comes clean. Many employers do the one-time pre-employment test just to see if someone can make looking for work a priority long enough not to use any substances.<br>  I'm sure the rest of the guys around the office or shop have heard of this and by now another few thousand people have seen this, so the deterrent factor of the company's test procedure has increased exponentially.|`|AA11206283	Beats getting fired I guess.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Yes you can.You or Your Coworker is lucky he wasn't fired.

SC is such a state.<br>  <br>  People who voluntarily quit for "good cause" as they had no choice can get benefits. <br>  <br>  There are other conditions but when it comes down to it if a person fails a drug test they really have no recourse. Sorry.. it is legal and that is that when it comes down to it. <br>  <br>  I cast no judgment at all. But they did what they did. Unemployment is only going to pay maybe half of what they made and even then the upper limit is super low. <br>  <br>  After 18 weeks it is time for the coworker to find a job.... any job.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	remember all those papers you signed when you first got the job. there HAD to have been a clause in there somewhere stating the company's drug policies.

If you have kids with him contact JAG and set up the child support stuff now. you will get more $$ from the military than the states courts.
d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	The Hungarian-Jewish journalist Theodor Herzl had been assigned to report on the trial and its aftermath. Soon afterward, Herzl wrote Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State, 1896) and founded the World Zionist Organization, which called for the creation of a Jewish State in Palestine. The anti-semitism and injustice revealed in France by the conviction of Alfred Dreyfus had a radicalizing effect on Herzl, demonstrating to him that Jews, despite the Enlightenment and Jewish assimilation, could never hope for fair treatment in European society. Historically, it is true that the Dreyfus injustice was not the initial motivation for Herzl's actions. However it did go a long way to keep motivating him further into promoting Zionism. His persistent activism during his lifetime eventually led to the creation of a Jewish state long after his death.<br>  <br>  In the Middle East, the Muslim Arab press was sympathetic to the falsely accused Captain Dreyfus, and criticized the persecution of Jews in France.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Richard Dreyfus?<br>  You got a link?|`|2SQxX4oSaa	jews are always whining about something, and it's usually a lie.

vZ4NXlBmaa	the law doesn't say "XX is the maximum allowed speed unless your child is sick"<br>  <br>  why would you think you could get out of the ticket?<br>  accept it as an unfortunate incident, and learn that next time....you will get home much faster by going the speed limit, and not getting pulled over|`|AA11828439	Only if innocent, which you are not. Pay up and follow the laws. You are not driving an ambulance.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	The officer can let you off if he wanted to, hes not supposed to, but if you know him, or make good freinds with him, he may decide to do you a favor.<br>  <br>  At trial though the law is the law, and if you are speeding you are guilty, no exceptions.<br>  <br>  Justifiing speeding for something like your daughter being sick needs to be mentioned to the officer when he stops you, thats when its important since its the officers personal morals as to weather or not to punish you by issuing a summons.<br>  <br>  Getting out of it by the officer dropping the ticket for you is rare, to attempt it you just need to show up at the station when he is working to try and talk to him, or simply ask to talk to him over the phone if he is available, be polite and try to make him understand, he probibly has kids too.  I got let off for doing 115 in a 45, by doing this, because i was the "chinese delivery guy on the crotch rocket" and every officer knew me, they didnt want to lose their local lightning fast chinese delivery service by suspending my license like..forever most likely, i did feel kinda stupid for that one, good times though.  I told the officer i didnt like it when peopel rode my *** while im on my bike cause they could kill me, so i sped up to gain distance, i gained a lot of distance and passed a patrol car too<br>  <br>  Another way to get out of it is to amend it to a NON-moving violation, when you amend a charge, you plead guilty to a similer violation while sacrificing your right to a trial, it costs the court less time, and everybody is happier,  for instance, you could amend your speeding charge of 15 over to 10 over, or whatever, sometimes there are non moving violations that you may be able to amend the violation to, often these other violatiosn dont yeild points on your driving record, or have heavy fines.  they varry by state,  but some ideas are "failure to observe signage"  "unsafe operation"  "failure to make repairs"  "failure to inspect" "disorderly conduct"<br>  <br>  for serious speeding violations careless driving should be considered.<br>  <br>  You can also goto trial if you are unable to make a deal that will benefit you, to defend yourself in trial, you need not prove why you were speeding, it wont help you, you have to proove either, that you wernt speeding, or that there is no proof you were speeding.  Prooving that there may be inaacuaracy in the estimaation is reason enough to dismiss the case.  there are many ways to do this, youd best hire a lawyer to attempt it, which is expensive, its kinda  lose lose situations with speeding tickets, even if you get them dismissed it will probibly be a major headache, and cost a lot of time and money, your best bet is to try and make a deal, you dont neccessarily need a lawyer for this as the prosecutor will offer you some kidn of deal, but having a laywer may help you to get a better deal.|`|tnVrODt3aa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points put on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!|`|3BhXf5MYaa	Face it, you were exceeding the speed limit.

It "may" have been different if you were going to a hospital.|`|bsIzG62Aaa	First, it is not a sure thing that if the cop does not show up the case is dropped, sometimes it is rescheduled or the judge will just proceed with out the officer, every court system is different.<br>  <br>  Second, unless you took her to a doctor or the hospital on the same day, your ticket will probably stand.  in most cases, even with the proof of a docs visit the ticket will stand.<br>  <br>  With budgets being slashed and courts pulling in the only sure source of money, fighting tickets is getting harder.  good luck

5gG2OfHIaa	The effect on the criminal justice system of eye witness testimony is reinforce the defense counsel's need to select the dumbest jury members available.  People of normal intelligence understand that two eyewitnesses do not see a incident, in their free memory, with the same recollection.  One witness says the woman at the scene was 5'7" and the second witness says 5'3".    That is a normal variation of perception between people viewing an incident.  But, a dumb jury will go for the "the witnesses for the state are not reliable because they do not agree with one another" argument.  The defense would call that "reasonable doubt."  It may be to a very dumb jury.  Forget that the two witnesses, likely, have no interest in the outcome of the case.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	Great question!<br>  <br>  The more research goes into memory, the more falible and changeable memory is revealed to be.  People can be convinced they "remember" all kinds of things that never happened, or happened in a different way.  See Carl Sagan's book "The Demon Haunted World" for more on this, its a really facinating subject.  <br>  <br>  But it has been slow to work its way into the court system, which has been based on testimony for hundreds of years both in the US and Brittan.  A witness' memory basically has to be discredited, and this is hard to do.|`|4TD4xg5Xaa	This is what happens. The police will have you look at multiple mugshots. If you cant find the accused suspect they will help you out and give you hints like "No thats not him" , "that ones not either". When you eventually pick the right mugshot you are a credible eye witness and your testimony will hold up in court. The police then get another conviction and a bad guy goes to jail and the prison system makes money. Everybody is happy and justice is served. After all, America is the land of the free and the home of the brave.

I believe parents can claim children as dependents on returns up to the age of 21, but I'm not certain about this as I'm not a CPA.  Alot of kids don't know what they want to do upon graduation from high school and continue to live with their parents, making them a burden to feed, clothe, etc. so that's why they maintain the tax credit.  Even if you only lived with her for 5 months and 3 weeks she can claim that.|`|AA10832514	Its a good question.  She can claim you and if you claim yourself as well, then the IRS will catch it and figure it out for you guys.  I would say that she can claim you because she provided for your support for at least half the year.

hBbvvpzBaa	I work for a brokers office doing health insurance and I have never had a problem terminating a dependent at any time throughout the year. All insurance companies are different but the majority is that you can drop a dependent off your health plan at any time. If the plan runs 1st of the month then you will have to wait till the end of the month for him to be terminated. So if his new insurance is effective 3/1 he should be able to be dropped off your medical plan effective 2/28. <br>  <br>  The one time a year rule is for if you are adding a dependent to your group plan, this is called open enrollment period where you can add dependents. Or a life change event where you can also add dependents on off anniversary. If it is your employer that is telling you that you cant terminate him off your plan then I would suggest calling the member services number on the back of your medical card and asking them about it.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Once you sign up for insurance through your job, you have to wait to make changes until a period called Open Enrollment.  It usually happens once a year.  I think the only exceptions are if you are newly married, newly divorced, or have a new baby or one of your dependents dies.  Any other changes have to wait for open enrollment to be made.|`|AA10832514	You can only drop a dependent during open enrollment at the end of the year or if you have a qualifying event.  A qualifying event would be the birth or death of a dependent or a divorce or a qualified judicial decision.  Otherwise, your plan can refuse to allow you to make any changes or charge you a premium for doing it.

Although the rest of the things you talked about are relevant to your life, they don't bear any weight on the elements of the crime of theft.

That said, it's a pretty lightweight offense, and, depending on where she lives and the level of crime in that area, the police may or may not take it seriously.

e1z8pHfmaa	I would say the answer depends on whether probate has closed on your father's estate.  If the estate is still being probated then their is almost certainly a personal representative handling these matters.  All debts should be paid before probate closes and also before beneficiaries the will get their share of the estate.<br>  <br>  The fact that it was an interest only loan has no bearing on this... that was what your father agreed to.  The fact that it is unsecured simply means that the creditor cannot reach a particular asset for repo.  It does not mean that they do not have a valid claim against the estate.<br>  <br>  If probate has closed and the assets are distributed then this creditor does not have a whole lot of recourse.  If however the estate is still open, they have a valid loan, and they simply want to be paid.... well then they very likely have a valid claim and you should not be looking at this as them asking for the children to pay off the loan.... they are merely asking that your father, rest in peace, pay his debts before giving away the rest of his money... and they are likely well within their rights to do so.|`|AA11206283	uh...did he have any assets?

The bank made an unsecured loan.  The bank set up the loan in that way, and now they will eat the consequences of their decision.  The bank may sue your father's estate for collection of the remaining debt on the loan, but as you say, there are no assets in the estate.  If there is no pending administration (or probate) of your father's estate, and it appears none is necessary, then the bank would have to file an action in the probate court which would be a foolish business decision on their part unless they knew of assets that were owned by your father at time of his demise.  If your father made gifts to his children during his last illness, or within a short time before, then the bank may reach those assets in the possession of the children, by alleging and proving that those assets were "gifts causa mortis," i.e. transferences in contemplation of death and thusly depriving prior existing creditors.  It appears that they have no grounds to so allege, or that it would be an anemic effort for them to do so.  I would advise "holding your grounds" and informing the bank in writing that you consider their efforts to be illegal attempts to collect a debt from persons not legally responsible, and should they continue to do so that you will take legal action against them.|`|AA10979361	This banker is using scare tactics to try to get you kids to pay for a loan you are in no way legally responsible.

Then when all the creditors have been paid, some of it goes to pay any fees like if there was an estate administrator, or probate attorney, and then all the rest goes to the decedent's heirs, or any named beneficiaries in a will. If the deceased has no assets, then the creditors are out of luck. You are not responsible for your father's debts unless you cosigned on any loans he had.<br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	The heirs should pay all the debts of the deceased person out of the estate, it is what he would have wanted and it is the right, moral thing to do.<br>  <br>  If there is not enough to cover the debts you will not be responsible, but you inherit the obligation to pay the debts before you get any money.<br>  <br>  You should not be able to profit from the fact your father died, and the lender should not be ripped off just because he died.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

It did not work in the 1930's and it will not work now. The great depression was ended with World War II...why? It's because private industry kicked in making airplanes, tanks, etc. So everyone was empolyed mostly in the private sector.<br>  <br>  The government doesn't create anything. If they do create a job, how will they sustain it? That's right, with taxpayers money. So when all of these big government projects are completed, where do these people work then?

eCbhygS8aa	Most of these people can't imagine that, they call themselves the party of christian values yet have no empathy. <br>  <br>  Many people who once thought that if you did the right thing and worked hard, you would be successful, will see that hard work is not always enough. There is also a such thing as being a victim of circumstance. Unfortunately, as we dive deeper into this recession, many people who weren't capable of seeing the other side of the fence will be on it themselves and get a reality check.<br>  <br>  Even then they still won't understand what its like to be truely deprived. There are people who grow up in foster care, with abusive foster parents, and are kicked out at 18 with nothing but the clothes on their backs. There are people who have uneducated mothers, who work 16 hour days at multiple minimum wage jobs,  and still don't have enough money to get by without welfare. There are people with drug addicted parents who end up working and raising their siblings, instead of going to school,  at 12 years of age, so their family can stay together (it could be worse in foster care) - and no, working at 12 isn't legal, but it's naive to believe that just because something isn't legal, it doesn't happen. <br>  <br>  It's a shame that instead of being grateful that they're not in that situation, these welfare bashers complain about how they'd never be in that situation. They have noone but the Almighty to thank for that.<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA - Most people I've seen in the ghetto DO have jobs. It is not always a choice to be poor but if you were raised by in the ghetto, by uneducated parents, often times you end up poor too.

That's a stupid situation you've set up, and it's not based on any reality. Almost all poor folks have a home and family and have had the opportunity to attend school etc.<br>  <br>  I'd go to a church looking for private charity to help. Perhaps there would be good Christian people who would take me in, and help me to enroll in school, and help with my lack of education. That's charity, as in freely given help.<br>  <br>  Barring that, the only other way to survive would be crime. <br>  <br>  Oh, and I've seen some large crowds of poor men in inner cities, hanging around the corner liquor store, not working very hard. <br>  <br>  Peddle your lies and myths elsewhere.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	The only reason people are in the ghetto and on welfare is because they want to.

Plus most drug dealers living of welfare and off my hard earned money have more money than me. I don't live off welfare and I survive. My mom who had to drop out of school at 13 to help her family (she didn't have a GED). She has always had a job and we never lived in the getto. It is there choice of life.

Hey stick with the story you gave, don't veer from it.  Also, 12 year old cannot drop out of school in the US and cannot be hired  because of Child Labor Laws.  Children under 18 are allowed to work very limited hours per week, not enough to "support" a family.  The child should stay in school and get a High School diploma.  Then move to Chicago, he would be given alot of "Free stuff" there.<br>  There you go adding to the "story".  A 15 year old with no parents would be a ward of the state and required to finish high school and would not be working.....funny, your story states he quit school to support the family and then you turn around to say there is no family....I can't follow your story.|`|kl9tTmGLaa	This question is moot.  I was 15 years old 20 years ago.  I was born and raised in Manhasset.  If I had been thrown in a poor ghetto, I would have survived without welfare because I have basic survival skills and don't wait for the government to bail me out.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  How many poor people do you know that know basic survival skills?<br>  <br>  Who cares?  If someone doesn't know how to survive without welfare, that's not my problem.  I know what I can do, and have always done, to survive.  It's not up to me to make sure everyone knows how to take care of themselves.<br>  <br>  All of us were given brains.  Unless you are mentally disabled, and actually incapable of logic and good sense, you should be able to survive on your own.  How do you think people survived during the Depression?<br>  <br>  Again, your question is MOOT.

It follows the economic cycle.<br>  <br>  Unemployment is generally lower and the economy is in general beter shape with democrats than republicans. The Republicans gave us our last century's first bubble and great depression, the Eisenhower (the next Republican) gave us two recessions, while Nixon gave us another, and so screwed things up that Carter, in order to end Nixon and Ford's inflation, had to tighten the money supply and give us another minor recession. Reagan and the two Bush's all gave us recessions. Reagan's went as high as 10% unemployment, George(1) was fairly mild, but Bush(2) had 2, the second we are experiencing now which may turn out to be a depression that Obama will end (just as Clinton ended Bush(1)'s recession).<br>  <br>  Republicans are horrible at economy, and no one - African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, Latinos, Whites, should ever vote for them.|`|1NO10YfPaa	During the Carter years, which I lived through as an adult, this country was a very different place and the unemployment rates cannot be compared.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I would like to add that more poor whites, for the last 40 years, have voted Republican, outvoting blacks by a substantial margin, much to the detriment of both ; and,  I guess the man who saved Sir Winston's butt and his country had no brain.

You can only blame your predecessor for so long, then it is time to be a man and accept responsibility for your actions, you are now the POTUS and no one else, your failures will be on you not anyone else.<br>  Obama slapped the people who voted for him in the face, when he sent money overseas to fund abortions, while people were loosing their jobs and home at near record rates, in the United States.|`|Ym7H3x49aa	Well, the thing is democrats aren't the ones to blame. A big government interference isn't the problem, it's public transactions that are. Things like SS, welfare, and other govt handouts are what's milking the average tax paying citizen. I believe in a strong government when it comes to fiscal and monetary policy. I believe the government can catch the economy from slipping into a deeper recession or keep it from reaching extreme inflation. I don't agree with taking tax money and spending it on inefficient programs that don't stimulate the economy and gives incentive to unproductive people to become...well, unproductive! I'm not too familiar with Obama's new policies, but if he's one of those "poverty fighters" then he's doing the country a disservice by continuing to prop up a economically crippling programs. Lassez-faire is where it's at and always will be in this capitalist economy. Once you start to mix socialist programs in a capitalist economy, you start to run into problems. They are taking the nations wealth for granted and think "Oh well if we allocate some tax money here, it'll be fine. There's plenty where that came from." Well no, not really. You have to understand that people run this economy and their not predictable money making machines like the govt thinks. We have our own minds and can keep money from circulating by spending less and saving, which is what is screwing us over.

Can't wait to pick on Palin, right?<br>  That was a rhetorical question.|`|VK0brk89aa	Well Obama's MOTHER was younger than Bristol.<br>  <br>  Bristol Palin will be a great role model for teens and to talk with them on what not to do and why.<br>  <br>  Maybe your the one who should Stop exploiting Palin's Daughter.  <br>  <br>  ** if she wrote a book it would be a great tool for parents to read with their sons and daughters. Bristol is in strong favor of not being a teenage mom and to wait until your much older.<br>  <br>  So what's really bothering you?  That she didn't abort her baby or she kept her baby?<br>  <br>  Aren't you ragging on a females right to choose? You are!  Let the smart, strong females who are willing to sacrifice their young lives to care for their HUMAN babies alone. They are doing what they believe in that's right and their CHOICE should end your RANT.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	First, I don't think Gov. Sarah Palin needs any help getting press coverage...she usually hides from it. EVERY station played Bristol's interview with Greta, so I think the media attention came to her, and not the other way around.<a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fnc/every_network_picks_up_gretas_bristol_palin_interview_108810.asp?c=rss" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fnc/...</a><br>  <br>  Second, capturing your thoughts and reactions while they are happening, from your perspective at that age is often better than writing about an experience after you have grown up and gotten some perspective. Lots of the everyday angst and simple pleasures that make a book real and readable are lost when described years later.<br>  <br>  Third, I doubt many single teen moms have time or even consider writing a book. She has a unique opportunity. I heard her interviewed and she seems like she is wise for her age, although she clearly was not smart to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Fourth, she has the perspective of someone who is against abortion and that will be a unique take on the situation.<br>  <br>  Fifth, I realize you hate Palin, and you must realize we can't stand Obama. I don't read his stupid "The Audacity of (Running for President when you are an Idiot) Nope" because it would make me ill. Similarly, you probably shouldn't put her book on your short list. Let the readers decide if she has something to say. I wouldn't have recommended Barack write any of his books, but look at how many people loved them and love him...go figure.  It is a free country...if you think she is such a loser, then you should welcome her book so she is exposed. Nancy Pelosi's book was so terrible, she had the bad reviews scrubbed from Amazon (who else has those kind of strings?) Conversely, had Barack's mom written a book back when she got pregnant, had him and all of her stuggles (giving birth in a Kenyan hospital, travelling back to Hawaii with a newborn, applying for State of Hawaii acknowledgment of his foreign birth (COB), applying for welfare and food stamps) I actually think it would be an interesting book. But I doubt any of her contemporaries would have suggested she write it...let the readers decide. <br>  <br>  One thing is certain, only the bad reviews of her book will get media attention, because only the New Party's viewpoint gets covered in this country. <br>  <br>  [Thanks for letting me know it is coming out. I just went to Amazon and let them know I want it when it comes out: (go to the VERY bottom of the page; "Found what you were looking for?" click NO, then input your request; and Send) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=palin+bristol" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_?url=...</a>  ]|`|59iSPST0aa	Why don't people just leave her alone, there are more important to discuss.

Lots of parents take pride in what their children accomplish. I dont think Mrs Palin is proud that Bristole got pregnant at 17, but I think she must be proud of the responsibility she is taking on and how she has handled herself and the baby thus far.<br>  <br>  Lots of women could write a book on teen motherhood/pregnancy, but have they? Let Bristole do what she wants to do, and let Sarah Palin be a grandmother for a little while without people jumping to conclusions.|`|noo8vpvzaa	Bristol is 18, not 17...She'll be 19 this October...She is now a legal adult, and as such she can do whatever she wants...Why would it matter to you?...No one would force you to read her book<br>  <br>  Liberals keep saying that teenagers need EDUCATION so they'll stop getting pregnant...Maybe Bristol can write about how babies are made and what birth control is, since you guys think that's all they need...<br>  <br>  But, I think she'll most likely write about RESPONSIBILITY, since that's what Republicans think the problem is...She can write about how she was IRRESPONSIBLE, not that she didn't know how babies are made or what birth control is, and that after becoming pregnant she has learned to take responsibility for her actions...She can also continue to emphasize that it's best to WAIT until you're older to get pregnant, as she wishes she had.<br>  <br>  Did you question the validity of Nancy Pelosi's stupid book (that tanked, btw)?...Have you questioned the validity of ANYONE else's books?<br>  <br>  Have you ever read a book?|`|TBIAIAcnaa	Mainly to raise her profile.

In 2002, I announced a goal to add 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of the decade. Since then, we have added 2.3 million new minority households. My Administration has also set a goal of adding 7 million new affordable homes to the market within the next 10 years. In my FY 2006 budget, I proposed a single family housing tax credit and two mortgage programs -- the Zero Downpayment mortgage and the Payment Incentives program -- to help more families achieve homeownership. In 2003, I signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, and I have proposed more than $200 million to continue the American Dream Downpayment Initiative to provide downpayment assistance to thousands of American families. By promoting initiatives such as financial literacy, tax incentives for building affordable homes, voucher programs, and Individual Development Accounts, we are strengthening our communities and improving citizens' lives. <br>  <br>  NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2005 as National Homeownership Month.

Not just Fannie and Freddie, but in all the private firms that were issuing mortgages to individuals without confirming income.  To all the firms making loans to people looking to "flip this house" and couldn't do it profitably when their 2/1ARM interest payments doubled at re-set.  And regulating the complex securitizations that hid the true risk of non-AAA bonds fasley classified as high grade mortgage securities.<br>  <br>  There were a lot of people who were arrogant about the strength of the US economy.  Hopefully we'll be constructive and re-learn the lessons of the Great Depression without actually experiencing it again.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Barney Frank won't even admit it.

The United States of America, Look at <a href="http://www.lonympics.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lonympics.co.uk/</a><br>  The world's biggest economy and by far in terms of spending and power the worlds strongest army, the most powerful democracy, and the media center of the world, plus in many ways the center of world diplomacy and foreign relations. This easily makes the USA the worlds most powerful country.<br>  <br>  2. Russian Federation<br>  The second largest army, and a puppeteer of many Central Asian states. The largest European population, and largest world area, which gives it immense control over itself, and immense levels of independence . The size of Russia helps give it extra resources and abilities that make it such a big power.<br>  <br>  3. Peoples Republic of China<br>  The 4th or 2nd largest GNP depending on different measures (Either normal measures, or ones which cancel out misleading totals for currency values, in that later case China places second) a recent riser, above France and Britain, It also has established itself as having nukes. a huge army, and is becoming even more of a international power, as of the resource hungry booming economy, though even if that stalled, it would still be 3rd, as of other advantages.<br>  <br>  Plus massively the Largest population in the world, And like the above 2 is a UN Security council member.<br>  <br>  4. Japan<br>  The State of Japan has the second largest economy, and a big democracy, large population, but surrounded by China and the USA.<br>  <br>  5. Britain<br>  UN security council status, nuclear weapons, G7 economy, a leading democratic state, and a media from music, to actors center, that has a lot of influence over the world as of it's popularity. Membership of the EU adds to it's power.<br>  <br>  6. France<br>  The fifth republic has UN security council membership, is a nuclear power and has a lot of influence over Africa. It is also a G7 economy, a leading democracy, and has a quite large army, one of worlds most powerful- surprisingly.

0oV4pWPiaa	You know it is truly a sad day in America when a president dedicates his life for 8 years to doing nothing but serve his country full time and making decisions that would make you liberals hang yourselves and what you do to repay him is you spit in his face. Bush has liberated 50 million citizens in Iraq that were tormented, tortured and killed by Saddam Hussein. I find it ironic that Democrats are always fighting for the people who are being persecuted yet when it comes to 50,000,000 people being oppressed by an evil Dictator, they tend to look the other direction. George Bush brought an evil dictator to the unforgiving justice of a rope and let him drop before his citizens. Under Bush's watch, millions of terrorists that have been wiped off the face of the earth with America still holding the record for the smallest number of US fatalities in a war this long. No other president can even begin to try to match those achievements. Former President Bush has done so much to keep this country safe from another 9/11 I can't even begin to tell you. The true tragedy of it all is seeing how the American people treated him...Calling him a war criminal, thinking up idiotic conspiracies of 9/11 being an inside job, publicly mocking him, saying he doesn't care about the American people while they do nothing for the country except criticize those in charge. History will be the true judge of his presidency.|`|qlduZDO3aa	No, Bush fumbled the ball with Iraq.

Never in my lifetime had sentiment towards Americans been as positive as it was on Sept 12, 2001.  <br>  <br>  The Bush Doctrine, "you're either with us or against us," closed the door on a multilateral solution to the terrorism problem.<br>  <br>  In addition, he tried to fight an unconventional war by using conventional methods.

We had satellite images of the S.A. training camps and interpolated GPS coordinates of them. Instead of hitting them where they lived and trained we set up a battleground where they could come into and back off from to regroup which allowed them the opportunity to train and restore their base to beyond 9/11 capacity. AlQaeda is stronger now than before. And 3 out of the 4 nations of origin of the 9/11 assault team are called our allies. Opps Georgie, that was the wrong target.|`|YaTgrhr9aa	How ludicrous can one possibly be? The liberals blaming Bush for the 9-11 terrorists attacks is really ignorant and foolish, by the way, we were attacked for 8 full years under Clinton, so why not blame him?

The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor."<br>  <br>  Not that I believe in any of that bible stuff.

Thankfully they are few but enough of them to give the rest a bad name.  If you are married to a Marine Colonel you are his wife not a Colonel and the Sergeants wife is a wife and not your subordinate.

As a result of this collapse, there will be a cry out for a more sensible money policy.

After that, we can rebuild our country from scratch.<br>  <br>  The collapse will not take too long if we keep spending like we are.  But a return to sound money could take a while.|`|TAYErNRkaa	The only way Obama will 'fix' the economy would be to do what he said he was going to do. Bring transparency to the government, work across party lines, openly debate any legislation before voting on it, eliminate pork that is piggybacked with legislation it doesn't belong in, erase the markers special interest groups are holding on some of our politicians, stop catering to lobbyists who's interests are in opposition with the will of the people, eliminate earmarks in all legislation, draft talented professionals from the economic community, creating a round table debate, toward the goal of reaching a consensus between peers, stop letting the african-american community strong arm him for fear of being labeled an 'uncle tom', and stop thinking the government can solve this economic dilemma. History does not support that intervention from the government can stop the bleeding. There's possibly a solution somewhere in the middle, with a limited infusion of money aimed at a strategic link in the marketplace that stabilizes the break in the economic skeleton and allows it to heal. I do not presume to have insight to that location, or if it exists.

Under the proposal, a married couple filing jointly could save up to $3,400 a year in taxes. The alternative also ensures that no additional middle class taxpayers will fall victim to the Alternative Minimum Tax.<br>  ?<br>  Help for America’s Small Businesses: House Republicans propose to allow small businesses to take a tax deduction equal to 20 percent of their income. This will immediately encourage investment and free up funds for small businesses to hire new employees and create jobs.<br>  ?<br>  Assistance for the Unemployed: House Republicans propose to make unemployment benefits tax free so that those looking for work can focus on providing for their families.<br>  ?<br>  Extension of Unemployment Insurance Benefits: The alternative extends through December 2009 the current temporary federal extended unemployment benefits program to help more long-term unemployed workers.<br>  ?<br>  Stabilizing Home Values: In order to encourage responsible buyers to enter the market and stabilize prices, House Republicans propose a home-buyers credit of $7,500 for those buyers who make a minimum down-payment of five percent.<br>  ?<br>  Expanded Net Operating Losses (NOLs): The proposal expands the NOL carryback rules, permitting businesses to carry back their NOL deductions for five years, rather than two. This<br>  would provide many previously profitable companies the opportunity to seek immediate refunds of past taxes paid, giving them cash infusions that would help them weather the current economic storm.<br>  ?<br>  Bonus Depreciation / Small Business Expensing: The House GOP alternative extends the favorable depreciation rules contained in the 2008 economic stimulus package, providing businesses, both large and small, enhanced incentives to make critical investments that they might otherwise forgo during these challenging economic times.<br>  ?<br>  Repeal of Three Percent Withholding Requirement for Government Contractors: The measure repeals the rule requiring three percent withholding on certain payments made to taxpayers under contracts with federal, state, and local governments.<br>  ?<br>  Health Insurance Deduction: The alternative levels the playing field regarding the tax treatment of health insurance by providing a new above-the-line deduction for those Americans who do not receive tax-preferred, employer-sponsored health coverage. This provision would provide a critical tax benefit to Americans who must purchase insurance on their own, regardless of whether they itemize their taxes or take the standard deduction.<br>  ?<br>  No Tax Increases to Pay for Spending: House Republicans are concerned that the level of spending in the congressional Democrats’ trillion dollar package could result in near-term tax increases on American families and are insisting that any economic package include a provision precluding any tax increases now or in the future to pay for this new spending.<br>  At the outset of this process, President Obama expressed his desire to craft a bill that’s about creating new jobs; unfortunately, Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill have turned his vision upside down, cobbling together the trillion dollar spending plan that will hit the House floor today. The House GOP’s Economic Recovery alternative is an attempt to refocus this process on job creation to help pull our economy out of recession.

He had to go through the exact same process anyone from another country would have to go though. Is it fair that only the wealthy, skilled or those with family members can get in?

NO! But, guess what, if someone breaks the law, they go to jail. Coming here illegally IS breaking the law. All the time in this country US citizens and their US citizen children are separated when their parent(s) are incarcerated. Is that fair to the children? No, but is it fair to the rest of the population to leave their parents free to break the rules? NO! <br>  You cannot claim bias against your people while demanding special exemptions. I'd hate to see what happened to me if I stayed in Mexico illegally. Mexico is a LOT stricter on immigrants then the US is. There is no way at all for me to become a citizen of Mexico, but, I could become a citizen of Canada or the US in about 5-7 years. <br>  Mexico biases against EVERYONE.

If not for the end users needs, the crime would probably not been perpetrated...

Both sides of the equation need to be attacked... Supply is equally important as demand..<br>  <br>  Your thoughts on visa availability are valid. However, do you still feel it is OK for us to allow 1 million new workers a year, when we are losing more jobs than that in two months?? Can you name an industry that is expanding right now that they would need even 20,000 new workers??? Point is this....... America does not have infinite resources, there is no money tree, and jobs just don't fall from the sky... Look on a smaller scale.. Like a football team... Only so many spots on the roster, and those that want it have to try out for it..

How fast you will advance will depend on several factors, but the two most important factors are the advancement percentage for your rate and your ability. <br>  <br>  Every rate has an advancement opportunity percentage and they change every advancement cycle. When your going for E-4/E-5/E-6/E-7 you have to take an advancement test in order to advance in that rate. Your test score will determine, among many other factors, whether you are in the advancement percentage. As long as you have a good eval, and your score is within the percentage you should advance. Your score is based upon a combination of test score, awards, degree, etc. <br>  <br>  If your a hard worker and go above and beyond in your job you can get what's called an EP (Early Promote) on your eval. This will allow you to take the advancement exam early. For example, if your an OS2, you have to have 3 years time in rate to be eligible to take the advancement exam but if you get an EP on your eval you can take it with 2 years time in rate.<br>  <br>  I believe the time in rate from E-2 to E-3 is 9 months and then you have to be an E-3 for 6 months before you can take the advancement exam. You have to be an E-4 for 2 years before you can attain eligibility to take the E-5 exam. E-5 to E-6 is 3 years, and I think E-6 to E-7 is three years. To get E-7 though you need to submit a package and not only take a test but you have to interview as well.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, if the stars were aligned just right and you were the greatest thing to ever come into whatever rating your in, you could possibly make E-7 in about 8 years but that's with always being able to take the advancement exam early.|`|AA10874247	I thought you meant you were going in as a Nuke... some of them do it in 8 years. <br>  <br>  Always helps being in an in demand rate where advancement is fast. The nukes that have gone to instructor duty came out as E-6 and in a few years of sea duty were able to get E-7. <br>  <br>  Advancing to E-5 should be pretty fast, gets a little harder afterwards. Some people never make it to E-7 and do 20 years. Doing over and above your job rate, getting recognized by your command, doing whatever it takes to pass the tests, studying as much as possible about your rate, all will factor in getting advanced the first time around. Proving yourself as an expert in your field over a couple of years, work on quals above your paygrade, and be "one of the guys". <br>  <br>  Just be careful about volunteering for too much and saying yes to everything asked of you. All depends on who's asking. <br>  <br>  One problem people face in advancing is when they wind up working out of their rate. Happens to SEALs or anyone who goes to shore duty. Some people will go back to back sea duty for the money as well as advancing, then go to shore duty or something else. <br>  <br>  If you're not doing the minimum amount required, and you have a respected division, you'll get advanced. But bad leaders and a weak division make it hard to get advanced.<br>  <br>  Also a word of advice: KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING YOU DO. When it comes time for your eval, if you have it ready, you have a record of all these things you've done over the year, and that can influence higher scores. You have to look after yourself, but there are one or two good mentors that from time to time have connections. When it comes time to reenlist, you should not be so eager to reenlist and let them see what they have to offer. It is still a contract and you have a choice to stay or go, so don't take the first thing offered unless you feel it's for you.|`|tcUXitYJaa	typically to make CPO your in the navy around the 12-15 year mark but some do make it in the 7-10 year time frame. i'm confused because you mention nuke et then you say your a os? all ranks from e4-e6 test twice a year upon eligibilty for advancement. you take a test for CPO and if you pass you become board eligible and then a board convens to see if your worthy of advancing to CPO. SCPO & MCPO are based on your performance.|`|8om6eMvnaa	There is no guarantee.  I've seen 7 year chiefs and 20 year first classes in the nuclear field.  <br>  <br>  A nuke is E3 out of boot camp and third class after successful completion of 'A' school.  Through E4 it's a pushbutton advancement with no TIR or Advancement Requirements.  A person enlisting as a nuke skips E2 altogether.  There is still a STAR reenlistment opportunity after successful completion of the entire nuclear power program from third class to second class.  It is another pushbutton advancement with minor time requirements and an additional 2 year enlistment.<br>  <br>  There is no OS rating in the nuclear power field.|`|EFanlkFSaa	Sea Time, Experience in Rate, Sea Time, Pass your SWEs, Sea Time.|`|AA11622716	After E-3, all promotions are competitive and depend in part on the number of openings available.

Other people like to blurt out sighs, and gestures in court rooms about juveniles because of there age and the crimes they commit, so it can cause conflict within the court room, and the court does not need that kind of conduct within that region.

The BAH you will receive will be at an E-5 rate based on your zip, it seems you know what that amount will be. Then on top of all that you will get a monthly stipend of 1000 for miscellaneous stuff that isn't taken care by the bill directly.|`|AA10709853	the specifics will not be hammered out until August.

I see where you're coming from though. Blacks and other minorities like to express their "pride" through TV and other media outlets and think it is politically correct to do so. But when you see a white person marching down the street celebrating their caucasian/anglo roots, then it is considered racist. The only problem you would run into is pointing out the fact that your race is superior to others whilst putting other races down. That would be morally wrong in today's society. The civil rights movements and "black power" was in a different era where equal rights were emerging so it was sort of a bubble bursting effect where they were allowed to vent off their steam. However, today times have changed and now things are beginning to level out for all races. Don't be afraid to express your pride!

Leave his ***, you can do, and deserve better than that.|`|hdz4GJTFaa	I have been in your position.<br>  I will give you the advice from my experience, but also keep in mind that every relationship is different.<br>  I got married at 17 to a guy that was joining the Army.  He went to basic/AIT all at the same place, with all guys.  I had gotten some news that he had been writing his exgirlfriend while in basic..<br>  It is hard to wonder what they are going through when they're gone.   I was young, and freaked out when I heard it.. and didn't leave him alone while he was training.  Now, years later, I regret that.  We ended up getting a divorce, and he went to Korea.<br>  Now, Korea, there isnt very good odds that he wont cheat there.  My ex-husband at the time told me many stories about girls over there, and what goes on.  Keep that in mind.<br>  Now, we're married again, and I'm in Iowa as he is in California.  In my situation, giving time to adjust to the military, and letting some time pass between us was the best thing.  Sooner or later, he will want a family.. and you need to let him decide that.<br>  Whether or not you've moved on, or you want to get back together, is up to you.  My advice is to let him go and see where that goes.  You will probably be happy with it later.

67eb1e4855fbbd1c5305adc6026dce4faa	SF is Army, Recon is Marine|`|4b2db3b9958feef8314918b568e1e91daa	United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance (Force Recon) units are special-purposes units roughly analogous to the Navy SEALs, Air Force Air Commandos, or U.S. Army Special Forces and are widely recognized as the "special operations forces" of the United States Marine Corps. Marine Force Recon personnel, or "operators", perform highly specialized, small scale, high-risk operations, such as:<br>  <br>  Amphibious and deep ground surveillance. <br>  Assisting in specialized technical missions such as Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, Radio, sensors and beacons, etc. <br>  Assisting in ordnance delivery (i.e., designating targets for close air support, artillery and naval gunfire). <br>  Conducting "limited scale raids", such as gas and oil platform (GOPLATS) raids and the capture of specific personnel or sensitive materials. <br>  Hostage/prisoner of war rescue. <br>  Unlike the other special purpose units listed above, Force Reconnaissance units are not a part of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), although some Force Recon Marines have been assigned to a special unit, "MCSOCOM Detachment One", in an attempt to start integration with USSOCOM.<br>  <br>  Force Reconnaissance Companies are deployed within a type of larger Marine Corps units called a Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) or MEU(SOC). MEU(SOC)s are deployed onboard Amphibious Ready Groups, a group of United States Navy ships. This group is usually centered around an amphibious assault helicopter carrier (designations for these ships range between LHA, LPH, and LHD). There may be as many as three of these groups, with their attendant MEU(SOC)s, deployed around the world at any given time. The mobility and continual rotation of these formations is integral to current Marine Corps operating procedure, which sets a stated goal of being able to field a MEU(SOC) on any shore around the world within six hours of an order being given.<br>  <br>  There are currently seven MEU(SOC)s in the Corps. In Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) I WestPac, there are three MEUs: the 11th, 13th and 15th. They are responsible for the Middle East and Persian Gulf region. In MEF II MedFloat, there are also three MEUs: the 22nd, 24th and 26th. They focus on countries around the Mediterranean Sea. The last MEF, MEF III, has only one MEU(SOC), based in Okinawa, Japan: the 31st MEU.<br>  <br>  As of 2004, there are currently four active Marine Force Reconnaissance companies: 1st Force Reconnaissance, based at Camp Pendleton, California; 2nd Force Reconnaissance, based at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina; 3rd Force Reconnaissance Company, based in Mobile, Alabama and 4th Force Reconnaissance Company, based in Honolulu, Hawaii. 5th Force Reconnaissance was folded into non-Force 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion as Deep Reconnaissance Company, and is based with 31st MEU(SOC) at Okinawa.<br>  <br>  The structure of a Force Reconnaissance Company is more similar to that of an infantry battalion than a standard company. The command element includes the Commanding Officer or CO (normally a Lieutenant Colonel), Executive Officer or XO (normally a Major), a Sergeant Major and the S1 (Administrative), S2 (Intelligence), S3 (Operations), S4 (Logistics) and S6 (Communications) officers. The bulk of the Company is divided into six platoons, under a Platoon Commander (Captain) and a Platoon NCO (Sergeant, Staff Sergeant or higher). One of the three platoons is a scout/sniper unit retained from the MEU's Battalion Landing Team. Force Recon units also include U.S. Navy Corpsmen as integrated combat medical personnel, and, like corpsmen in all Marine Corps units, these corpsmen receive the exact same training as the members of the units they support.<br>  <br>  Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance was first conceived in 1954, at Marine Base Camp Pendleton, outside of San Diego, California, when an experimental recon team was formed. Three years later, that team merged with an existing amphibious reconnaissance company to form the 1st Force Reconnaissance Company. The precursor of Force Recon was from World War II, the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion commanded by Captain James L. Jones.<br>  <br>  In 1958, half the Marines in 1st Force were removed from the Company and hauled over to the Eastern seaboard, forming the 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company. 1st Force supplemented Fleet Marine Force Pacific (FMFPac), while 2nd, Fleet Marine Force Atlantic (FMFLant).<br>  <br>  Force Reconnaissance received their baptism by fire during the Vietnam War, arriving first in 1965 and staying for five years. Forty-four Marines of 1st Force were killed or missing in action through the course of the war.<br>  <br>  After US withdrawal from Vietnam, 1st Force and 3rd Force were both deactivated in 1974, and the existing Force Marines were rolled into the non-Force 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion in order to maintain Marine Corps deep recon capabilities. However, the roll-in was never completed to a satisfactory condition, and 1st Force Reconnaissance was reactivated as an individual unit in 1986, and was later deployed in the Gulf War.<br>  <br>  Several Force Recon Companies are in existence today, and have been deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan.<br>  "Greenside Operations" are operations that are not intended to include direct contact with opposing forces. This encompasses the bulk of traditional Force Reconnaissance missions, usually "deep" reconnaissance patrols where the six-man recon teams are usually too far ahead of the main force to expect artillery support or quick helicopter extractions. In these situations, Force Recon Marines will rely on stealth, evasion and training and not firepower to accomplish their mission. Generally, an operator's kit would include:<br>  <br>  A "boonie" hat, more recognizable to the general public as a fishing-style hat in camouflage pattern. <br>  Camouflage Utility Uniforms; Marines are now issued the new "MARPAT" Marine Pattern utility uniforms with a "digital" or pixelized camouflage pattern. <br>  A load bearing vest (LBV), a vest with many pouches for carrying ammunition and supplies. This could either be the current standard issue second generation US Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) Fighting Load Carrier vest (FLC) or the late 1980s to early 1990s US Integrated Individual Fighting System (IIFS) non-modular load bearing vest (LBV-88) (the latter of which is actually more popular, since the current issue MOLLE is considered not durable enough for prolonged use by many Marines), or an operator-bought third-party LBV. <br>  A rucksack, a large backpack for carrying items that need not be often accessed. Many Marines have publicly voiced a preference for the seventies-era All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment (ALICE) packs over the unreliable modern MOLLE packs, but individual operators may buy third-party packs which surpass both aforementioned government issue products in durability. <br>  Rations, toiletries, fuel, water, ammunition, etc. <br>  Primary weapon depends on the Marine's role in the squad. It can range from carbines (M4) to rifles (M16, M14) to squad automatics (M249 SAW). <br>  A sidearm may be carried, but usually not in a tactical thigh-mounted configuration. <br>  Boots. <br>  Armor (bullet resistant vests such as FSBE vests and ballistic helmets) is usually not worn on greenside operations as they are too bulky, trap heat, and generate noise upon movement. Force Recon operators shown wearing armor and helmets in photos when apparently on greenside operations are actually in training, where the armor and helmet are a safety requirement.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Direct Action Operations<br>  Direct Action (DA) or "blackside" operations are operations involving a high probability of direct contact with opposing forces, and can include Tactical Recovery of Aircraft Personnel (TRAP), Gas/Oil Platform (GOPLAT) raids, Vessel/Board/Search/Seizures (VBSS) and other missions involving close quarters battle. The unit may also include special operators as the mission requires, such as explosive ordnance disposal personnel, electronic warfare specialists or others, and the unit may be inserted into the mission area by a variety of means via land, air (parachute drop or helicopter), or an amphibious method. A common operational kit includes:<br>  <br>  The MICH Helmet and a hands-free communications headset (usually a TELEX Stinger 700) and tactical goggles. A NOMEX balaclava (a hood with a large opening for the eyes). NOMEX is a fire-retardant fabric developed post-Korean War for use by aircraft pilots that has since been found useful for many other applications. <br>  NOMEX flightsuits and NOMEX aviator's gloves. These are usually sage-green in color, but there appears to be a khaki version as well for desert operations. <br>  FSBE vest with attached pouches for magazines, grenades, flashbangs, breaching charges, gas masks, medical supplies and communications equipment. Ballistic insert plates are used in this case. <br>  High-tensile nylon pistol belt or rigger's belt with suspenders, used to attached more pouches or drop-leg devices. This may be worn like a traditional belt (mostly rigger's belts) to keep their trousers, or as a second belt, specifically for equipment. <br>  A thigh-mounted tactical holster (usually a Safariland 6004 holster) with the MEU(SOC) .45 sidearm, at times with an underframe flashlight installed. This sidearm is usually attached to the operator's belt via a retention lanyard. <br>  Another drop-belt thigh setup on the leg opposite the operator's handedness, either with a "dump" pouch, for easily stowing spent magazines, or additional ammunition and munitions pouches. <br>  Tactical kneepads and elbow pads, for protection and operator comfort as he moves into various firing positions. <br>  Boots, or specialized hiking shoes (seen in Iraq). <br>  The primary weapon for Force Recon is the M4A1 Close Quarters Battle Weapon (CQBW), which replaced the Heckler & Koch 9 mm MP5 in 1998. M4s can be found configured with a variety of reflex sights and attachments for quicker target acquisition. <br>  A back-worn quiver for a breaching shotgun, either a Remington 870, a Mossberg 500, or a Benelli M1014.|`|AA12301836	I COULD TELL YOU, BUT THEN ID HAVE TO KILL YOU......|`|b3197756bf3995e1609da96136b476fdaa	<a href="http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Smith_112003,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,131...</a>|`|dd0629d08c6d7eadbeef6cd2cfaad097aa	alright heres the deal with this. Marine Special for ces (recon or force recon) the diffrance between the two is the levels they support on the battlefeild. Also USMC recon as well as select other units help man the socom forces as well so it is possiable to be in the usmc and be attached to special forces.<br>  <br>   As far as schooling you will have to enlist in the marines as a 0300 infantry option. now when you get to SOI (school of Infantry) you will be selected to go to one of the infantry MOS's. theirs 0311 basic rifleman, 0313 LAV crewman, 0331 machine gunner, 0341 Mortorman, 0351 assualtman, 0352 tow gunner. <br>  <br>     They say you have a choice and will give you a wish list for 5 options but in the end it comes down to where you qualify and what the marine corps needs are at the time.<br>  <br>  your gonna want to get into 0311 talk to your instructors when your their let them know your goal of being recon and they will probable hook you up with a time and date you can take the endoc.<br>  <br>  What that is, is a test it focusis on being able to do a 1st class PFT a swim section and another PFT after that in wich you must get a 1st class. Now depending on the time and needs again it will come down to your skill and strength. ..... ok so assuming you do pass it..........<br>  <br>  you will finnish the training as a 0311 and as soon as school is done you will be sent to the west coast to a lil place know as magaritaville in san diego were you will go throught the recon training to get the MOS of 0321 wich is recon.<br>  <br>  As far as school is concerned you may or may not go to jump school you may go to dive school or a host of others... or you may go to none and do "in house" training depending on what division you go to and their units dreployment scheduale..... well i hope this helps and good luck oh yah if you do enlist do me a favor and tell them a CPL.

681c6f04fcf319f8e9985df8f0684a99aa	Hi David - contempt of court, disrespecting the court, and violating a court order could begin the list. This is an example of tv not representing real life. If you are in a Civil Court, your attorney would probably lie and say you had taken ill. If you are in an Appeals Court, you better not count on winning the appeal. If you are in a Criminal Court, it could even be construed as violating probation (when you are in the custody of your attorney).In other words, it's not a good idea and could be considered insolent behavior. <br>  <br>  (former legal secretary)|`|b3299c31748a306630be6657d72ee9baaa	You can walk out if you like, it doesn't matter the judgement will still stand.

Ok. here it is i was in a accident may 24 i talked to a lawyer and have not signed anything, nothing. well i went to call insurance yesterday and they would not talk to me stating they can only talk to my lawyer. how could he do that when i have not signed nothing. i told insurance i only spoke to him and did not sign nothing and they said there is nothing they can do. What can i do? i am so mad, angry, and upset."<br>  <br>  The quick answer to your question is "Write a letter (return receipt requested) to the 1) insurance company with copies to 2) the state insurance regulatory agency, 3) the attorney, 4) the state bar association, and 5) the attorney disciplinary agency in your state."<br>  <br>  First, depending on where you live, you do not have to sign a retainer contract with an attorney to obtain legal representation from that attorney, so be sure you didn't agree to have the attorney represent you when wording your letter.  Regardless, you can fire an attorney AT ANY TIME (and generally that attorney is only entitled to fees from you for what he actually did to pursue the objectives you discussed with him-- if any).  <br>  <br>  The insurance company-- that is represented by counsel-- is just covering their backside, since they can't talk to you as long as you are represented by counsel.  The attorneys must speak to each other.<br>  <br>  So, explain that you did not retain the services of the attorney and that any further contact with the attorney is unauthorized in addressing your claim.  The copies will put the attorney on notice that his services were never contracted and that his participation is unauthorized.  Informing the bar association and the attorney disciplinary agency in the state also let's the attorney know you mean business and gets the ethical watchdogs of his profession involved in case he tries to act unethically moving forward.<br>  <br>  That said, you might still want an attorney to represent your interests.  If so, state in the letter that you are in the process of hiring an attorney and will have that attorney contact the insurance company shortly.<br>  <br>  [This is not legal advice. You should consult a licensed attorney-at-law for legal advice or representation before making decisions that may affect your legal rights.]|`|b4dd6d518eace5a2b082912bf388bd6eaa	whos fault was it?? and if your lawyer called the insurance company that is why they won't talk to you..but i would go ahead and hire one if you haven't allready|`|AA10470529	The "legal" system is wrougt with corruption even on the seemingly lowest level. Yes it is potentially illegal and absolutely ethically wrong how the ins. co.s/shyster is behaving but the system supports it.  You are being railroaded or bulldozed as it is commonly known. Apparently this lawyer contacted the ins. co.s and struck a dirty deal behind your back, realize also that this is standard "legal" proceedure. <br>  <br>  The worst thing you can do is to in any way trust the legal system or its officers, this includes any ins. co employees.(they are licensed and technically officers too) To readily establish this as true consider the less complicated issue of property damage, your car. By "law" the party responsible for the damage must reimburse the party at loss the FULL RETAIL VALUE of such property as charged by a local and reputable dealer of the party at loss' choice. However, all that ins. co.s will offer is wholesale cost at best. Legally, you have the right to the full amount that it would cost to replace your vehicle in your local market. Go to your local car dealerships and price what it would cost to replace it, then look at your settelment amount. If CCC did the market cost analysis as is common amongst insurers its half or less. Worst of all this obviously less than adequate amount will be enforced by the court (if not properly handled, and any lawyer attempting it will destroy his/her career, you don't bite the hand that feeds you) You like many need to realize the system only considers people as resources to be exploited and manipulated by them and their abominable creations(institutions and corperations) They only make it look good on paper for us and just do what ever the hell they want because we are often dumb enough to let them.<br>  <br>  Regardless of others advice you've accepted You can file your own case (and handle it better than a lawyer) I'll gladly assist you if your interested in real justice otherwise you'll have to settle for what they'll give you. Fighting them through them is definately stupid although exactly what they taught you to do. Its about them not you or, do you have the back-bone to prove otherwise?<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION  10/12/06<br>  <br>  In retrospect to your issue, actions speak louder than words. Show them you have not attorned counsel by sending them a written settlement request yourself. This will screw them out of forcing you into a forum of their decptive design. This is the first step you should take as a professional or self litigant though not mandatory, not having evidence of attempting negotiations prior to filing suit will reflect poorly on you.  The only draw back will be possibly low-balling the amount you could potentially receive. So just don't the first offer of a good settlement/negotiation is almost never accepted anyway, there is nothing illegal about asking for more than what is eventually accepted. There are resources available to you so you can determine a fair or starting offer that is good as any professionals. Your property damage and injury claims are seperate matters. <br>  <br>  Oh and you should also know you actually have the upper-hand in your matter. Realize that if they don't like your offer or refuse to negotiate again going to court will cost them BIG especially before a jury. And the best part is you cannot lose! You may think 30k for trial is nothing to a corperation but, they are greedy if they have to pay you 20k more than what they feel your claim is worth they must by fiscal duty pay it, for them it is ONLY about the money so use it against them, they will and do to you.

You will have to show that she was an instigator and accomplice by instructing/permitting you to commit your crimes.

AA10515896	It's actually up to the client to make the decision, not the attorney. The attoney advises the client (here defendant) but the client makes the call.<br>  <br>  A jury trial is allowed in civil matters in most states. And guaranteed for federal civil trials under the 7th Amendment. There are different ways to argue the case before a judge or a jury, and the defendant here thinks they'll have better luck before a jury. That's their right.|`|AA10470529	To intimidate/trick you into obtaining a fellow double-agent of the "court" (attorney [traitor]) so they can handle the matter to their mutual benefit. A jury trial is actually a very risky situation for an attorney, much, much riskier than before a so-called "judge"(and fellow officer sworn to each other in loyalty [not integrity] to hang 'till dead for violating their shared oath). It is also much, much more expensive for the defendant. They are most likely just bluffing.   <br>  <br>  If the merits of your case are valid this actually works in your favor, don't be deceived by these notorious liars' antics.

6e330153d0c6d191925ba91b295a3e14aa	The guy in records is nuts. Did he gets arrested? If not then the cop obviously believed him. There are a few checks completed on scene that you may not know about. It is incredibly rare for everything to match especially if the stopped person had valid ID on them. It helps to have the vehicle registered in their name, have a few other items in the wallet with his name like car insurance etc etc. It happens all the time. The warrant must describe the person wanted pretty clearly like height, weight, hair, eye colors, and will have identifying numbers to Id's as well. The last resort is for the officer to take them in to be printed if print class is available on the warrant which will be if the wanted person has ever been arrested anywhere before. There is not a lot that can be done other than always having an ID on you or close by and other supporting documents. They will never put on the warrant "Hey it ain't this guy in Georgia"......|`|e29a1ab633da5634f69d15a585adf2deaa	Take a close look at the website below and watch the online presentation.

Trouble here is this happened when both sides are a little more modern, and are able to mobilize a resistance in a fight thats a little more evenly matched. <br>  <br>  I tell you this, if after the Iraq war... The United Nations decided that the people of the Sunii nation who were removed or lost their homes due to the fighting, needed somewhere to stay, and hot damn if Florida wasn't Perfect for them. So guess what US, Florida now belongs to these displaced Sunii's. I bet there would be some pissed of people, and I bet there would be some fighting that would go on for centuries in the hopes that this land would be given back to the previous owners.

Both sides are truly extreme in their beliefs and many people in mainstream America don't vote because they understand the beauty of freedom and the benefits that come from a competitive market. I truly agree that both sides do this! Freedom of speech is practiced by everybody as it should be! To limit this is to limit the prosperity of a free nation! Before you vote for someone please understand everything they are doing. Both sides are using different types of big government with horrible results! Their dreamworlds will never be fulfilled no matter how many promises the politicians give them! How many times today do you see a person give every freedom back towards the people? They exercise their freedom (as they should) but then turn around and take other freedoms away! Both sides are deteriorating freedoms as we type! I hope that someday there is a way to stop people from taking other people's freedoms through government force! Just because we give up our rights does not mean that it is peaceful!

Don't let your good common sense get thrown out the window knowing that the ramifications could be much worse if he's in jail the rest of his life. That would do you AND your baby absolutely no good.

GhynuLY7aa	Iran is a regional power that needs to be recognized as such. Instead of treating him as an enemy, which the West started after their revolution in 1980, we should seek cooperation with them. We could solve many more problems by weakening their clerical authorities. The only way to do that is by bringing them closer to us, giving bigger chances to the moderates to take power effectively. The more we attack, the more we reinforce the conservative ayatollahs and thus some stupid worthing on Israel and the States.<br>  There is not going to be any war because the States know very well that entering Iraq is one thing, but entering Iran is another. The geography is different, the population and the army are different. During 8 years, the West attacked Iran through their ally, Saddam Hussein.

I don't think the Democrats are going to allow us to do anything, so Iran wil continue to thumb their noses, and insult us, and Israel until they are capable of actually backing up their words, or Israel blows them away. One of the two, but I expect the former.|`|8446b0bd7a0c5d7795039d6c92b20599aa	I don't think that the nations in the region, or the US, really wants an all-out war. The only possible scenarios will be if Ahmadinejad were to announce that an attack on Israel would be imminent or that they test a nuclear weapon. If those two things happen, all bets are off about diplomacy being the means to solve any issue. Iranians are basically peaceful people. The last election that was held for local positions showed diminished support for the hardliners in office, including Ahmadinejad. Iranians are more interested in finding jobs, having food in their markets, fixing their infrastructure, and dealing with diminished freedoms that their mullahs are taking away from them, especially university students. Most of them are opposed to the way Ahmadinejad is threatening Israel or the west. They want peace. In the war with Iraq in the 80's, Iran lost close to a million casualties, 75% of whom were noncombatants. They aren't ready for those kinds of losses again anytime soon. The US has offered to hold weekend diplomatic talks with Iran and Syria in Baghdad over the situation in Iraq. Hopefully, that will lead to more discussions on cooling down all the war talk. Iran will have added UN sanctions against them because of their nuclear program. It's up to their leadership to tone down their attitudes & talk of destroying Israel so they can live in peace. I don't think a war will happen unless Iran pushes the envelope towards a confrontation. I hope Bush and the US will stick with diplomacy, too.|`|68a63136fa1787748cfa1acf58f33767aa	Iran under Hussein had a modicum of stability, cruel as it was, but when Bush raided it under what turned out to be false pretences, to protect American business interest (oil) in  Kuwait, he de-stabilised the whole area. Now the country is like Northern Ireland was, but more vicious, where one branch of Islam (Sunni) is fighting another branch (Shiite) for supremacy, and America, Australia and the UK have got a tiger by the tail. If we all withdraw, Shiites will pour in from the surrounding countries and join the fight to seek revenge on Hussein's Sunnis. So what do we do - let them hack each other to pieces? I don't pretend to know.

AA11046288	I don't know what state you are in but in Wisconsin we can go to wisconsin circuit court access online (www.wcca.com) and look up anyone for any law violation for free, but birth certificates usually cost money on a detective type website or you can hire a personal investigator to do all this for you, but that's obviously not going to be free either. Marriage certificates are usually classified under legal stuff, so you can usually find that for free in the same place as criminal records. I would try to go to yahoo and type in '(your state) + circuit court access'. If that doesn't work then search something similar like 'criminal background check in (your state)for free'.

7c574f054e8253c0c1fed2d7bb341b4eaa	Okay let's take these one by one...<br>  1. Capital punishment is appropriate when absolutely NO doubt exists. How many innocent people have been executed or imprisoned only to be later found innocent? <br>  Abortion should be a woman's issue. In our country men and the government should have no power over what a woman does with her body!! I refuse to believe anyone regardless of political affiliation wants to promote abortion. The fact remains that it exists because just as many men as women don't want to be held up to personal responsibility.<br>  2. On the large scale like Wal-Mart or KB&R or EXXon Mobile-Yes. Someone needs to safeguard the rights of the individuals in respect to the power of the corporations over the individuals. Yes.<br>  3. No. I feel every law abiding citizen should own as many firearms as they want. I don't think that the United States has the right to impose law onto any country that WE are not willing to abide by. That's why so many other countries don't like the U.S.,because we don't walk our talk.<br>  4.So you can federally fund other countries natural disasters but not federally fund social activities that many Americans feel is important in our society for it's growth.<br>  5.It was that thinking that caused all of the pollution in our water systems after WWII. Green House Gases and the problems they cause exist. Just like other forms of pollution. Why is it so difficult to simply agree that we cannot continue to pollute the environment and not fix what we are doing wrong?<br>  Cycle changes that you are referring to happen over LARGE periods of time like thousands of years not 50 or 100 years.<br>  6.Homosexuality exists in every realm of species. It isn't just a human lifestyle choice.Yes for most it is a natural impulse.Why is someone physically satisfying themselves in any matter in a concensual relationship anyone elses business? People act as if homosexuals are exhibitionists who are trying to recruit everyone and endoctrinate the masses to their way of thinking. Relax people!!! That isn't the case!<br>  7.Do you think that by ignoring Aids...it will go away? <br>  The government already tried to do just that when it first became a global problem that's why Aids/HIV is the epidemic that it is!!!<br>  8. Just because you and the people you choose to associate with may be good and decent people who are teaching their children about personal responsibility and safeguarding themselves and their partners in respect to sex.....doesn't mean everyone is. Society and bad parenting has reduced our public teachers to have to deal with these subjects because many people with conservative DO as I say attitudes don't deal with their children as human beings.... in their own right.... just extensions of themselves. Being a parent doesn't give you the right to impose your beliefs as a weapon to judge your children with. Besides it is being proven again and again that many of the people who hold themselves up as moral conservatives are in practice living outside what they preach. As long as no one knows it's all good!<br>  <br>  So... do I have this right...<br>  to be a good conservative you have to be on the surface moral....but in fact immoral and only practice what benefits you.<br>  In fact a hypocrit?<br>  Come on good and decent people exist in every political party.<br>  As well as immoral and corruptable.<br>  The job ahead is to hold politicians accountable for all they do and say. <br>  I can agree to disagree with you. And I still like you and am interested to hear what you have to say. It is completely possible that you have a point of view I completely agree with. Some things I am conservative about. Some things I am liberal about.<br>  Openly sharing opinions and knowledge is the only way to effectively legislate to the masses.|`|6161ee348ed965b98e1c4054c1f29c8caa	Sounds pretty dang close.|`|76ea3a562a33cdae910d9e4983afb205aa	BELIEF has to do with Religion.<br>  <br>  LIBERALISM has to do with promoting freedom in society.<br>  <br>  Believing that you "have to believe" something makes you a Conservative !!!|`|b9984aad1dea15baadd9b195f76e2c28aa	No, you are way off.

VAvl0v2jaa	As a renter you are entitled to your deposit unless the lanlord can show just cause for not rendering to you.  Unfortunately you will have to get an attorney to ask for proper documentation and reciept for expense or photos.  The burden of proof will be on them so if you honestly did nothing to damage the place you will likely get your deposit back plus attorney fees and court fees if there are any.  Good luck.|`|KigG6ejeaa	Did you sign a lease?  Then you more than likely have rights to your money back from the deposit, right now I am studying Accounting, and I didn't know that your deposit is actually suppose to be increasing in value (interest) as it is suppose to set in the landlord's account, so check with a local law office and ask them or maybe check with a local free law clinic and speak to them.  You also should have done a walk through in the beginning of the rental agreement and a walk through at the end of the agreement to help protect your rights. Hope this was helpful.  Good Luck|`|AA10712736	you will lose because of unpaid rent.    legally you probably owe more.      i am going to guess at the details but i am probably correct.    all changes to a contract even verbal contracts must be in writing.     but that is contract law...|`|26bef0ebc1d6f9e8bccfcec40962131caa	contact a civil lawyer to find out what your rights are|`|5914d3cce0b8e6170ff830e8b9b2940eaa	Small claims court.

If the entire security deposit (or none) is not returned, the landlord must send, along with any reduced security, an ITEMIZED list of expenses that the security deposit was used for, i.e. "tear out/replace carpet in living room - $500", things like that.<br>  <br>  Normal wear and tear is NOT something the landlord can take out of your security deposit.  If you left the apartment in "broom-clean" condition, you are fine.  The landlord can choose to steam clean carpets, repaint walls, professionally clean tile grout, etc, but cannot charge for those extraordinary cleaning measures.<br>  <br>  Here's what you do:  <br>  1) Write a letter to your landlord formally asking for the return of your security or in lieu of that an itemized list of the things which he spent your security on.<br>  2) Send the letter certified, return receipt requested.  Make sure in the letter to include a deadline to hear back, like 14 days.<br>  3) If you don't hear from the landlord within 14 days, send another letter certified etc, demanding a response within a short period, like 7 days.<br>  4) If you don't get a response, or if you get a response and you're not satisfied with the itemized list, file a claim in small claims court for the full amount of your security.<br>  <br>  In court, you'll need to show the best that you can that you cleaned before you left.  If you had relatives or friends help you move, they can testify to the condition when you left.  Pictures are great if you have them.  You should also bring the communication you had with the landlord and explain that the landlord was dragging their feet.  If the landlord sent you a list of supposed charges, you can challenge any of them as frivolous or normal wear and tear.<br>  <br>  In most communities, small claims court is very informal and neither side has a lawyer.  It is actually very much like you see on the judge TV shows (Judge Judy etc).  <br>  <br>  One thing I should add - your state's attorney general may be able to do some of the legwork for you (sending letters and all) if you file a complaint with them.  In NY, they will mediate your problem with the landlord and often get very good results.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
fpb41Ge3aa	If your internet provider is threatening you with a fine, then you really need to contact an attorney.  Since the cable company holds no copyright on the material that you've downloaded, they cannot fine you for it.  In fact, no one can fine you without taking you to court, which first requires a Cease & Desist order.  As for the privacy aspect, I'd make it public what the company is doing.  This has been embarrassing to providers in the past and they stopped doing it.  Another alternative is to install a hardware firewall, such as a router which informs you when your computer is being probed.  <br>  <br>  Millions of dollars are being spent on both sides of the file-sharing issue and currently the copyright holders, being huge corporations, can outspend individual consumers to lobby lawmakers over to their side.|`|AA10515896	Most file sharing is willful copyright violation, and the statutory penalties can be as high as $145,000 per instance.<br>  <br>  File-sharing is not fair use. Fair use refers to using small parts of a work for educational, parody or non-commercial entertainment purposes. It is a very limited exception to the copyright laws, and has never allowed for general copying and distribution of copyrighted works.<br>  <br>  Yes, police need a warrant to look through your home or computer. But if you downloaded files through an internet provider, your computer passed certain information to that provider as part of the request. Most computer user keep the same default directories for downloads ("My Music", "My eBooks", "My Videos"), etc. So, they don't have too look through your hard drive if you just put it in the default location.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that copyright violation is illegal. If a work is privately owned, and you have not purchased a license to make copies (or to distribute it, in the case of file sharing) then that's federal copyright violation.<br>  <br>  The cable company (likely acting on behalf of the copyright holders) are giving you a chance to avoid prosecution by deleting the material. That's like robbing a jewelry store, and the DA saying they won't prosecute if you give it back.|`|PqcxdR3Vaa	they dont have a right, they need a search warrant as stated in the 4th Amendment.

A lot of people say that Officers are cold, but you are admitting that they have emotions.  Thank you, from all of them.  You ask,  why do some people feel the need to protect the Police?.  Maybe they have relatives that are Police, maybe they're sons, or daughters of Police.  Maybe they're just someone who appreciates the fact that there are individuals out there, who are willing to risk their lives 24/7 for complete strangers, and look forward to hearing the word Thank You, which is not heard that often.  You say that they can Obviously fend for themselves. Really?.  How different are they from anyone else?.

Se intentó encubrir el crimen de mil formas contando con la impunidad que solía reinar en estos casos... pero sus padres no se callaron, aunque eran pobres y con pocos recursos lograron que la población cercana primero y el resto después se movilizaran y lograron no sólo llevar a juicio a (hay que decirlo) algunos responsables sino, lo que es más importante aún, que el servicio militar dejara de ser obligatorio para pasar a ser voluntario. Con todo el dolor de la pérdida, a esa familia le queda el consuelo de que esa muerte cobró un sentido para el colectivo y que gracias a eso se produjo un cambio radical y se terminó con la humillación de la que eran objeto los conscriptos.<br>  Ojalá pueda generarse algo similar en México para honrar la memoria de esa mujer y para que se pueda construir en el sentido de la justicia y en contra de la impunidad.<br>  Queja y protesta no son lo mismo.|`|845ce0e390772c1b0449df226d37f8aeaa	ay ese tema me llena de corajeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<br>  <br>  <br>  Por dios, problemas gastrìcos? despues de ser violada, ultrajada, violada? tenia fracturas de cadera, golpes por todo el cuerpo!!!

The results, itself, cannot be used in a court of law.  For instance, if you took one and the report was favorable, you could not use it to exonerate yourself from a crime. <br>  <br>  The way polygraphs are used are to gain confessions or damaging statements against oneself.  The report itself cannot be used as evidence, but a prosecutor CAN and WILL bring in the polygraph expert to testify.  The polygraph person becomes a witness because you directly answered questions about a certain suspected crime and they will tell the police, prosecutor, judge, and jury exactly what you said.<br>  <br>  REMAIN SILENT.  Refuse to take the test.  If the police say, "if you take this test we will not charge you with anything," don't believe them.  They can and will charge you.<br>  <br>  You should have an attorney.  You should not take this test.  Use your right to remain silent and do not give any investigators or detectives information that can be used against you.  Even if you think info cannot be used against you, believe me.....police and prosecutors are very talented in twisting words and stretching the truth.|`|v8r8bLRfaa	If you are unsure of an answer then just say you aren't sure and the examiner should clarify.

"Yes"  "You have the right to remain silent..."|`|NkbhHcIAaa	other then for work related reason (law enforcement ) never take a polygraph test , PERIOD  the best thing anyone can do for them self if arrested is keep your mouth shut , yes it ticks those off in law enforcement , something awful , but truth be told keep your mouth shut

It was almost gale force winds.   I was stopped by the most handsome Highway Patrol man I ever saw.  He looked like he belonged in a movie; pale coffee colored skin, tall, and very pleasant.  <br>  <br>  It was very windy.  I had on a Rodeo denim dress with a full full skirt.  He came to the side of the car and (my Father was a policemen and I am scared for their safety when they stop people on highways like that because gawkers often lose control and hit them)  so I said "please let's go over in the field because I do not want you to get hit".  He appreciated my concern, but then the wind was really making my dress fly everywhere and over my head - very embarrassing and I was trying to keep it down.  He was such a charmer and he was laughing and laughing but trying to keep control and be stern - he had  the deepest dimples I ever saw on a chiseled cheek.  He finally regained his composer and said, "Mam, you must slow down.  Now please get back in your car and proceed safely".  With that we both got in our cars - laughing our *sses off and left the scene of my crime.|`|AVAlSyTUaa	First of all,  you're NOT a safe driver if you're doubling the speed limit.  You don't have the skills necessary to keep control of a vehicle traveling at high speeds.   Second, yes you did get a cop in a good mood.  You should have been arrested for wreck less driving and not having your license on you.  Then taken to jail.|`|53cc6a401c0e12428280a5e36332b2f1aa	I"ve been pulled over dozens of times and only have had 2 speeding tickets. The most I've gotten a warning for was 15 over the limit. <br>  <br>  Some officers give warnings, some do not. Usually, if you aren't a jerk to them, they will let you off with a warning, or if they like your car lol. Sometimes an officer might let you off with a warning because they might be going to a call, know you were speeding but didn't have a good reading on the radar, or their shift is over and they have lots of paperwork to do.  If you get pulled over without your license, you won't get a ticket if you have your license #, and all your information checks out.<br>  <br>  I understand your driving methods, because I do it too. I figure you have less of an opportunity of some other dummy hitting you, if you aren't around anyone. But speeding is dangerous, it doesn't matter if there are no cars around. Anything can happen, a kid running across the street, a loose dog, tire blowout, etc. These factors can cause you to lose control of your vehicle and either hurt someone else, or hurt yourself. My car has suspension modifications and top of the line tires, so I know I won't fishtail or lose control at high rates of speed. But you never know when there will be a pothole, puddle of oil, or water on the road. So just be careful. It might be fun to drive fast, but when you crash, kill someone or yourself, it's not worth it.|`|c48c792f1ce22f78cc8992acb2227d8eaa	I got pulled over twice within the last 2 weeks. The first time I was only going 50 in a 40 around midnight and the officer was cool about it and just gave me a warning and told me to slow down. The next time which was a few days ago I was in Daytona beach for spring break and it was around the same time and once again I got caught going 10 over which I dont even consider speeding cause I'm usually going 30+ over but yea the officer was also cool and gave me a warning. Oh yeah and any minor under 18 with a license, dont worry about your kurfiews, both times I was past my kurfiew of 11 and didnt hear a word about it :-D

Krav Maga is what law enforcement defensive tactics are based on, and what is taught in the academy. Strikes to the face, throat, groin, and shins are effective more so than to the stomach. If an officer is going to strike someone, the officer will not be worried about bruises and will have a story to back up his/her use of force. <br>  <br>  Alot of times, officers will use control holds or apply pressure to certain points on the body i.e.: neck, wrists, forearms, tricep area, that hurt really bad. These are not necessarily taught in the academy, but learned by fellow officers on how to inflict pain on someone to let them know who's in control.|`|547f5b1d679b79c320d53d1b57946dd9aa	Police officers do not care about bruises.  If a police officer is hitting someone he should be able to justify the use of force.  There are two reasons why police officers do not strike the head if they can help it.  number 1 is the simple fact that you would not punch an 8 pound bowling ball.  When you punch the human head its the same thing. Number two, many departments do not allow closed handed fist strikes to the head.

53cc6a401c0e12428280a5e36332b2f1aa	A psych test is different than the polygraph, so a psychological test is about 100-200+ questions. These questions are going to be yes or no type questions. Ranging from do you masturbate? to are you a vegetarian, etc. They get pretty intimate into your personal life. If there is anything you do not want them to know, then remember specifically what that is, because they will try to ask the same question later in a different way, that is why there are so many.<br>  <br>  This test is basically to determine if you are a sane individual, capable of making responsible decisions under high stress situations. If you fail this test, it will be because you answered yes to too many "red-flagged" questions, or you are too high strung or too passive.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend lying on questions about your past criminal activity or drug use, unless you know how to manipulate your response to a question. Good luck! and remember police departments are looking for certain personality types. Just because you do not get hired at one place for personality reasons, doesn't mean you won't get hired somewhere else.|`|AA11463345	basic questions to what kind of person you are. be very honest, because sometimes they will ask the same question twice at different points in the test to test you if you are lying.|`|bc0bb2f863caac6bfc841de531d04b91aa	There are no strategies.

Good luck!.|`|e3a89f390cd3a0492ec85692997fd04caa	I'm a psychological researcher so please take my suggestions seriously.  Depending on the test, it may just seem like random questions or they may be straightforward.  The most important thing is that you're honest.  Most psychological scales of this nature have honesty scales, and any attempt to fake out the test will only trigger these other sub-scales and they won't let you in.|`|db91234d414b90daa2987c34ad513cb1aa	They need to make sure you are Psycho.|`|39f995aaead6b9b6cf4abd92cdfbb2afaa	The test I took was made up of a couple of hundred questions, some of which repeat themselves and are asked in a different fashion.  They weren't yes or no, you had to answer on a scale (agree,disagree, strongly agree, etc...)<br>  They were mostly statements you had to respond to like:<br>  I like to read books<br>  I hear voices<br>  I am afraid of the dark<br>  I like to start fires<br>  I believe in God<br>  There was all sorts of statements, it's hard to remember them (except for the weird ones!).<br>  Some of them are hard to respond to like:  I like girls <br>  I am a female, so if I say yes, will they think I'm a lesbian? If I say no, will they think I hate women? There are so many statements to respond to that you just kind of go into answer mode and not think to much about it (I guess that's what they want).<br>  <br>  I read the evaluation the psychologist did on me after the test and it was very close to what my personality traits actually were.  There isn't much you can do to prepare, just answer honestly.|`|0686e457a634ce1e335c836cdfa1f056aa	Just be yourself.

They do not have as many open spots as city departments so they try to get the best of the best. I came from Los Angeles and moved to WA state. Up here the Staters are alot pickier than CHP. You cannot have ANY record, even more than 2 speeding tickets after you are 18 yrs old looks very bad on your application. <br>  <br>  But it all comes down to how bad do you want the job? The key to getting any law enforcement job is showing you are serious about it. They know everyone makes mistakes, and not everyone is a bad person. Just remeber to sell yourself, make them feel you are going to be an asset to the department, and that you have learned from your mistakes and want to do something good with your life.|`|AA11447467	As long is your past is squared  away, it should not interfere with your chances.

All they can do is tell you that you wouldn't be accepted and then againwith it being 14 years and it being taken care of, they may not even concider it worth worrying about. I wouldn't think so myself, but I don't know the rules they follow. I am in security and I have to have state clearance to do this. I have an aggravated assault charge on my record from when I was 17 and it didn't stop them from hiring me. The charges were dropped in court and that has been 34 years ago and I have been in this line of work for almost 5 years now. Good luck.
93z7cj1Saa	There are several siren tones available on emergency vehicles.  There isn't any protocol as to which sound to use when.  It is the preference of the person driving the emergency vehicle.  They will usually change the tones from time to time because the change gets people's attention who may have heard the siren for several minutes and have tuned it out by the time it catches up to them.|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	Several companies make different type sirens but most include the Welp, Worbble, Phazer, or standard type sounds.<br>  <br>  One company has even tested (I believe in England) a new sound which is better than the already existing sounds.<br>  <br>  There are no specific type sounds used, for any given reason as you ask, other than when "clearing" an intersection. Emergency vehicles will (obviously) make as much "noise" as possible to insure everyone is aware an emergency vehicle is attempting to enter an intersection or otherwise dangerous roadway.<br>  <br>  If a "patient" is declared "DOA"...no siren is normally used when returning from the call.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|53cc6a401c0e12428280a5e36332b2f1aa	No. The person operating the lights & sirens has the option of using 3-4 different types of sounds, it might sound different depending on what buttons they are pushing, but doesn't mean anything. But usually they do not ride with sirens when someone is DOA. <br>  <br>  Code 3 (lights and sirens) is used in emergencies only, and with ambulances they will only be using them when going to a call and going to the hospital with a victim. Some agencies have policies around residential areas, permitting them to use sirens only at certain times of the day.|`|z78yFpQGaa	Usually if the person is already dead they don't run lights and sirens.

30fd0edbe83227446e05cb007ffd7345aa	i don't know about CA,but i know about texas,they certainly can,but  most of the times  they don't do it,it depends on  what this person stole,i worked a different retail stores,and  they just post some pictures of this person on specific places,and they have the loss prevention guys look for you when you come back to the store.and  depending on how much this person stole is that they decide if they will turn this person in to re police or they  will have him sing this agreement  saying  he's never gonna come back to the store or any other branch,if he does it he will be going to jail|`|4c496d16598b2db6c615d4ede63abd85aa	Yes|`|0c4b9789ab4191571b7f1dc57ed656acaa	Yes, and there is a chance he will eventually get caught.<br>  -|`|3UVloKJVaa	Of course they can..

I worked at two retail stores in Torrance, CA and it was company policy to report all grand theft ($500+) incidents. It helps the local police because, if it is a string of thefts, the info will help to track where someone has been and might  pinpoint where they might hit next, or where they are planning their escape route.|`|aL7XzD7Kaa	Yes, which is partially why most stores have security cameras. If they discover things are missing, they'll go to the tapes and try to identify the person shoplifting from the store so they can press charges. Why would "getting away" from the store matter?-- it's still stealing.|`|b4b338b44ac6117d72347d28f5ac0917aa	Anyone can report anything to the police department. Will the police department investigate? Will the investigation yield anything? Those are two other questions, but often they do. But here is the real deal. If a person steals some lesser amount, like under $100, or maybe even a little more than that, and the store has little information about it, the police will file a report and that's about it. If the store gets more information, like a name or license plate to the car he or she got away in, the cops will investigate and may find out who stole the stuff. Of course, the more you steal, the more the cops will be interested. <br>  <br>  And if the store catches you and has you wait for the cops, the cops will come quicker and they'll get you.

93z7cj1Saa	You can guess any length of time and you would be right.  Different agencies have different standards and do things differently and take different amounts of time.  <br>  <br>  I have seen agencies take months to complete everything necessary to give a candidate a thumbs up or thumbs down.  Then I have seen agencies desperate to fill a uniform do everything in a month.<br>  <br>  The old adage of no news is good news usually applies here.  If they found a disqualification on your background it would have got kicked from the process and you would have gotten a letter.  No letter? Your file is still going through the process.|`|fYyMh3rxaa	A background check takes as long as it takes.  I have done backgrounds for many years, and these can sometimes take weeks or months.  If the investigator has a stack of people to look at, he or she has to prioritize their investigations (some others may be more important than yours).<br>  <br>  Then there is the practical consideration - budget.  They may not be able to bring you on board just yet.  Perhaps they have a budgetary problem and they have to wait a little while longer before they can bring a new person on board.<br>  <br>  Have you called to ask them what the holdup is?<br>  <br>   - Carl|`|53cc6a401c0e12428280a5e36332b2f1aa	Background checks are extensive, and if you gave lots of references, lived at alot of different locations, it can take a while. Sometimes anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. If there are other applicants, then it can take even longer. The best thing to do is keep calling, and asking them how is it going?

tobYXCfdaa	of course it is desirable and in some cases it is possible, however the rate of individual  success depends on a wide variety of factors. many offenders are not even interested in rehabilitation. some offenders cant be rehabilitated. the success rate in most places is not very encouraging.|`|974175b1329bebd36f3d0a3a4e301158aa	Well, if illegal immigrants can't be forced to follow the law and they are committing felonies on a daily basis, then how can you expect other felony offenders to be rehabilitated.  Rehabilitation takes a concerted effort on the part of all citizens to ensure that breaking the law will not be tolerated for anyone.  When felons serve their time, the community needs to ensure that the felon is rehabilitated and that he isn't harassed into committing more crimes.  I think it is absolutely desirable to rehabilitate felony offenders.  Sometimes the only reason they are felons is because they "learned what they lived" and never had a good example.  The whole purpose for imprisoning people was to rehabilitate them wherever possible.  That was supposed to be the purpose of parole--to give felons a second chance when they've shown they could behave properly.  If we don't have a rehabilitation program, we might just as well line all the offenders up and give them the death penalty -- whether you punish them in this manner or give them a life sentence in prison, the result is the same.  I don't approve of the death penalty and I don't approve of killing.|`|kBCKEMxUaa	Of course it is possible.  There are so many stories of felons reforming their lives and becoming valued members of society.  I dont even have to look because you are insane if you dont know that.  I personally know a man that was a felon, and then go out and went to law school.  Now he is an activist and a meber of the bar in good standing.  There are literally thousands of examples like this.<br>  <br>  Why wouldnt you want to rehabilitate a felon?  So you think its desirable to have over 1 million men and women just sitting around?  You dont want them to be working and contributing to this country?|`|1PgunJsUaa	I worked at the prison for 6 years before completing college, and I said no. I thought there was no hope for them and our system did not work. But I am now married to a man who went to prison years ago. He put effort in to gaining from the program and truly changed. I did not know him before or even right after release but his family tells me daily how much he's changed. I talk to his ex wife and she tells me how horrible he was then, and she's blown away by the man he is today. He's respect in our community, local schools and church . He has become a great person. I think you just have to use your best judgment. But remember if your wrong it could cost you your life. Good luck.|`|53cc6a401c0e12428280a5e36332b2f1aa	I am a compassionate person. I believe people have the ability to change, and there is good in everyone. I don't think it is our responsibility to do this, but some people need help...a little push.<br>  <br>   In the end, it is up to the individual to make these life changing decisions. I do not think it is society's fault, or the fault of the Department of Corrections for so many people flooding prisons, but we have to house them and feed them with our money. We (society) have given these people so many chances to change and to rehabilitate themselves. I have faith because if prison changes one person then it was worth it, I think.|`|TJqMmKnsaa	Of course it is possible.  It is up to the offender to desire such rehailitation before it will work.

e7055e40725795a209fc16d6a870747eaa	If you lived in Texas you wouldn't need to worry about it.|`|AA10515896	Generally, you can only use sufficient force necessary to defend yourself against the attack, given what the attacker is using.<br>  <br>  So, a 5'2" 120# person defending against a 6'4" 250# attacker would be allowed to use more in the way of physical weapons (sticks, etc) than someone of comparable size.<br>  <br>  But the limit is also based on type of attack. If the attacker is bare-handed vs. using a stick/bat vs. using a kife vs. a gun, the defender is able to use more serious force to defend against the deadlier threats.<br>  <br>  Using excessive force, like a 6' person using a club or knife to defend against a 5'2" person who is bare-handed, would potentially be punishable as battery.

Everything you do after your first defensive strike is what is going to be against you. If you continue to hit someone with a stick after you had ample time to get away, then you are no longer defending yourself. <br>  <br>  It is a different story if they have a deadly weapon.

PiOslkvHaa	You have limited due process rights in school, so that punishment is probably appropriate.   If they go after you in a legal action, they would have to prove that you intended for your friends to bring drugs into your car or that you were reckless about it.  That's hard to prove.  So I don't think you will be arrested.<br>  <br>  Here's the parent in me: I hope you learned a lesson about picking friends and helping them out when they do something dumb.|`|bc0bb2f863caac6bfc841de531d04b91aa	The only problem was that you knew they skipped school, and gave them permission to sit in your car.

Looks like your not going to find out much until the hearing.|`|53cc6a401c0e12428280a5e36332b2f1aa	Your school's policies are correct, however outside of school you cannot be charge with a crime.

53cc6a401c0e12428280a5e36332b2f1aa	Just remember to be calm and assertive, relax and act professional. When asked a question, be prepared to not answer by the book. Let them know you are aware of the "by the book" procedure, but you would make another decision based on other circumstances. Whether you are right or wrong, always explain why you made a decision. They are looking for individuals that can act under stressful situations, and not people who stumble and are undecisive.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and you will do fine if you have done your homework. Here's one question:<br>  <br>  You are on patrol, and notice a car infront of you driving erratically. You pull the car over and when you walk up to the driver window, it is the Mayor of the city. He/she is obviously intoxicated and the only occupant of the car. What do you do?<br>  <br>  The answer could be a police escort home, or have an officer drive the Mayor's car home, and you follow then take the other officer back to his unit, or call the Mayor's spouse. The reason you wouldn't arrest, is because you are taking the City's reputation into consideration. There are always factors to consider before always doing everything by the book. Just like you wouldn't arrest your own mother for DUI.|`|SqGVgfn0aa	dont lie, be honest, RELAX. i cant stress that enough.  be perpared i guess.  o and by the time you get to the psychologist, that dumb true/false answer thing is 3 hours long, and its 25 questions over and over again for 500 questions or so. be careful. well at least that's what's up in FL.|`|VpjQpAOYaa	Expect some tough questions.<br>  <br>  Many are scenario based, trying to find out what sort of reactions you will give.  Don't assume what they want to hear, most agencies will pass you by if you give "by the book" answers.  If you were out with a fellow cop and he was too drunk to drive, but was going to anyway, don't say that you would call 911, inform his supervisor immediately and all that stuff that you'd think the interview panel would want to hear.  They don't, because most people wouldn't do that.  Say what you would do.  <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly there will be some ethics questions, again, say what you would do, not what you think they want to hear.  <br>  <br>  There may be some videos, make sure you are taking in the whole picture, because there may be a situation going on in the foreground, and a crime being committed or someone drawing a gun on you in the background.  <br>  <br>  Relax, be honest, and good luck.|`|AA10268547	don't lie,  be yourself, and be honest.<br>  <br>  They may ask some questions that have no right or wrong answer, just to add stress,  <br>  <br>  I remember one of mine,  what would you do ?  you get to the scene of an accident and discover the driver at fault is the police chief, and he is drunk, and has just hid a bottle under the seat.  Following procedure you call your shift supervisor who can not come because they are on the scene of a shooting, but your shift LT arrives and in the police car but as they get out, you notice they smell like they have been drinking and their speach is slurred also.<br>  <br>  The police cheif is telling you to write a ticket for the other car or you will be fired tomorrow,  Your Lt tells you just tell everyone it is ok to go and don't do a report at all.  <br>  <br>  What do you do.
