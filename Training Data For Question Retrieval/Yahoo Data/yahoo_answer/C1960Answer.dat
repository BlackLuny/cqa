5e8bfd4f40a66f73272a2b251c8d304daa	Technika products are cheap.  Why are they cheap?    Because they are made to a low standard, using inferior quality components and poor quality control.    This results in poor picture, poor sound, and dodgy reliability.    Always remember, "Buy cheap, buy twice".|`|b8tgCAQJaa	"Technika" is actually an own brand label of Tesco supermarkets, similar to "Onn" and "Durabrand" for ASDA. It's just a house label used to re-brand products from a wide range of different manufacturers, so the quality can vary from product to product.    As well as being available in Tesco stores, you sometimes see Technika badged products available as end-of-line stock in discount outlets.    Some of the Technika products are OK, but you need to look for a review of the exact model you want to buy.

Be aware when buying the cable that there are two different firewire connector types, 4pin and 6pin.    4pin always goes into the camera and commonly laptops have 4pin inputs and desktops have 6pins although this is not set in stone so is worth checking for. Then you can use software (Windows Movie Maker/iMovie supports compatible IEEE 1394 interfaces) to capture the video in real time, export and burn to CD. You can also edit in anyway you want
KFagjt8Jaa	TV reception problem can occur during bad weather even if the elevation or azimuth of the Sky dish is only 1 degree out of alignment   A common cause of low Sky Digibox signal quality readings is the dish being knocked out of alignment by ladders or moved by high winds.

KFagjt8Jaa	If your TV and VCR/DVD  are only used to watch pre-recorded material (videos or DVDs) and never used to receive broadcasts, then you do not need a TV Licence. Keeping the broadcast receivers in the TV and the VCR de-tuned (DVD players don't normally contain receivers) is sufficient to prove to them that you do not use the equipment to receive broadcasts - but you must make sure that no picture, no matter how poor quality, is viewable on the screen. There is absolutely no need to physically modify, damage or remove the tuner or any other circuitry in the TV or VCR    you don't need a licence if the equipment is not connected to an aerial, satellite receiver or cable|`|b8tgCAQJaa	You only need a licence if you use your TV (or other device) to receive broadcast programmes.     You do NOT need one if you use the TV exclusively for other purposes, such as watching DVDs or playing video games.    From TV Licensing themselves:    "You do not need a TV Licence if you only use your TV to watch videos and DVDs or as a monitor for your games console.    However, please notify us in writing that this is the case. One of our Enforcement Officers may visit you to confirm that you do not need a licence."    (The second paragraph above is just a request - you don't legally HAVE to notify them or accept a visit from an officer.)    You do not need to "disenable" the TV, just don't ever connect it to any sort of aerial, or tune it in.|`|wI7bfiMgaa	"You do not need a TV Licence if you only use your TV to watch videos and DVDs or as a monitor for your games console."    First step is to not own, or connect an aerial to your TV... and do not have your TV tuned to ANY TV channels.    You have to write to the TV licence agency and tell them that you only use it for your games console (guilty until proven inocent it seems)    They may send one of their engineers round to confirm that you do not seem to be using it to recieve TV signals (if you have a TV aerial, they WILL assume that you are USING it... so throw it away, or pay 1000 fine)|`|uaa52n6Taa	IF THE TV CANNOT RECEIVE A SIGNAL THEN YOU DONT NEED A LICENCE SO TAKE DOWN THE TV AERIEL|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Buy a monitor, not a tv then.|`|zILwtO22aa	What you need is something like this on the link below, you can play games on it.  http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?Modu...|`|IqxFo2u7aa	if you  buy a new tv you'll have to give your address details to the retailer, if you get one second hand you won't.  if you don't give anyone any details then realistically no one's going to catch you I reckon,   also, and it's a big also, if you're not receiving outside broadcasts then you're not obliged to pay for the license, so don't plug it into the wall and you're golden I reckon
AA11151162	A few things I'm assuming:  Closed room w/ about 9' high with v-ceiling --> so about 9,000 cu ft.  2.1 system for 100% recorded music, not live music and not movie watching (HT)  Mini concert like sound --> you like high volumes and low end thump    For $1,000 you'll be better off piecing things together  Your room is very large --> Filling/pressurizing such room with sound and thumping bass requires lots of power. Beware not all advice you hear takes this into account. The choices below should satisfy you.    Components to buy:   1 Stereo Amplifier - $270  Harman Kardon is the best for music --> HK 3490, 120watt per ch  http://www.jr.com/harman-kardon/pe/HK_34...     2 Two main speakers (L + R) - $400  PolkDirect on eBay sells like new refurb speakers for a very good value. PolkDirect is the official Polk outlet store so no worries!  Monitor 70's would work well for your extra large room.  http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vie...     3 Powered Subwoofer - ~$230  New 2009 variant of the older BIC Accoustech H-100, 200watt, 12" ported powered sub  http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vie...  or for ~$150 more go for the eD A2-300  http://www.edesignaudio.com/product_info...  Note that eD subs are made to order.    Remember you'll need some $$ to buy cables for the speakers, sub signal and hooking up to the disc/mp3 player.  Monoprice is the best value place to get these:  http://www.monoprice.com|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Get yourself a pair of used vintage Klipsch speakers on eBay. When I was in high school, my friend bought a pair of Klipsch Hereseys and we would set them up in the high school gymnasium (2 full basketball courts) for assemblies and stuff, driving them with a Kenwood KA7900 integrated amp (90 watts a side). During sound checks, we would push about 30 watts into the Hereseys and walk clear to the other side of the football field to see how loud it was. And, it sounded like there was a live concert going on in the gym.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	That budget is a little low for a good music system.    Really good bass needs a good subwoofer and the best, budget-priced models start at about $500 from places like SVS Sound.  But a good self-powered subwoofer means you dont need full-range speakers for the left/right.    If it was me - here is what I would do:    - Get a set of Magnapan electrostatic speakers.  I think the MMG-3's are about $600 per pair.  These speakers have a HUGE radiating surface and can expose things in music that more traditional cone-based speakers cannot.  Audiophiles love these things.    - Get a Dayton Subwoofer kit from a speaker building site like www.partsexpress.com  You can build your own sub for about 1/3 the price of a retail unit.    - I like the current crop of Onkyo TX-SR receivers, but these are 5.1 receivers ment for a home theater system.  I would start crusing your local CraigsList for a 5-7 year old flagship receiver from yamaha or dennon.  These things are built for music-lovers (and the new $2,500 price reflects this), but I have seen used Yamaha A1 receivers selling for $300.    This will add up to a bit more than your $1,000 budget - but it will be a superior music system than many others.|`|475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	You might consider these speakers if you want bass:    http://www.a1components.com/itemdisplayn...

Your dv camcorder needs a firewire connection (ieee 1394) in order to download video, your PC probably did not come with a firewire port, so you will have to buy one and install it, since most computers (except possibly brand new) don't come with a firewire port, your camcorder did not come with a firewire cord so you have to purchase a cord too. Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder. Make sure your camera is in playback mode.  The fine print in your manual makes reference to firewire (ieee 1394) connection.
UIT1khqtaa	never buy stuff packs. it's worthless.  they only add some objects in which u can found and download on the internet, but not activities.    i recommend to try on Bon Voyage, Seasons and Open for Business. FreeTime too.  Pets is a lil' boring and worthless.  But Seasons is amazing, cos ur neighbourhood will hav seasons and there are lots of activities for every seasons.  Bon Voyage let u travel and stay in a hotel!  Open for Business lets you to open a business, whether it's in a house or in a store, whether a flower shop, a bakery, a restaurant or anything! The possibilities are endless!|`|Dso7k3sjaa	My two favorites are Nightlife and Seasons.  My least favorite was Pets, I even ended up uninstalling it cause I disliked it so much.    I do not have Bon Voyage, Free Time or Apartment Life though, so I can't really recommend any of them.  I do know that Free Time looks like a lot of fun and I have friends who have it and love it.    I do have University and Open for Business as well as Nightlife and Seasons though.  I like University even though a lot of people say it's boring, I really like the new items and interactions that University added.  Anyway, unless you really want to have your sims run their own businesses, I don't feel OFB adds a lot.  Although, if you like to have a goal which your sim can work towards, OFB adds that aspect to the game so you may find it very enjoyable.    But the two games which I do have and would not want to have to give up are Nightlife and Seasons.  Out of those two, Seasons is my all time favorite.    Oh, and regarding stuff packs -- I have Family Fun stuff, Glamour Life stuff and Celebrations stuff packs.  I bought each one individually because I have an older base game that didn't come with any expansion or stuff packs.  But I only bought those stuff packs when I found them on sale.  But the first person is right about the stuff packs, they only add new items.  I am still glad I have them, but I don't actually push people to buy them.  If someone gave one to you, or if you could find one for really cheap then it's worth it, but otherwise no.
ddd2b272975c49eb0b349a665e1d92eaaa	N82 has a symbian S60 v3.1 OS, most probably the application you are trying to install is not for S60 3.1, try to look for the application version applicable to N82 S60 v3.1, because there are several versions of S60 like v3.2, v5.1, first or second edition etc.    check this link and choose your phone:  http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/downl...    Well...just last night I tried to download and install the version of the same application for my N96 and it worked fine....have you tried to upgrade the firmware of your N82?  You can do so by downloading/installing Nokia software updater on your PC (can be found at nokia site) then connect your N82 to your computer via USB. Be sure your phone have full battery, to avoid harm to your N82 in case the battery goes off in the middle of the firmware upgrade.    Another, issue could be the memory card you're using is corrupt that is why your N82 could not properly access/read the file.  Have you tried installing other application with success?

RpCwfcRzaa	Along with being connected to the gamertag, DLC is also connected to the console it was downloaded on even if it was using your hard drive. This first became a problem when people's 360s got the red rings and after receiving a new replacement from Microsoft the DLC wouldn't work without being connected to Live. Fortunately for you, MS finally released what's called a license transfer that will let you transfer the licenses over to your 360. What you need to do is follow the steps here http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/system... and take your whole 360 over to your friends house. You will need to re-download the content (don't worry, since it will still be under your gamertag, you don't have to pay again) and switch the licenses to your console.

j7rBM2yTaa	Transformers are alien robots from the planet Cybertron, the Transformers are divided into two factions, the heroic Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the evil Decepticons, led by Megatron....    If a transformer steps down the voltage 2:1 from 400V to 200V then the current will be stepped up: (1:2).    Ohm's law I=V/R means the current in the secondary winding in your example will be 200/15 = 13.333A    Power = V x I = 200 x 13.33 = 2666.66W    Ignoring the losses in a real transformer, the power in each winding is theoretically always the same.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	The way a transformer works is that the primary and secondary windings are wrapped around a common iron core. One phenomenon of electricity is that when you have current flowing through a conductor, it generates an electromagnetic field. Also, if a current carrying conductor passes through a magnetic field, a voltage is developed that causes current flow.    So, when the alternating current passes through the primary winding, it generates a magnetic field that is felt by the iron core. This magnetic field is then felt by the secondary winding, which develops a voltage and causes current flow.    Basically, the power on the primary winding is the same as the power in the secondary winding. Sure, some is lost as heat. But, there is a direct correlation between the ratio of the number of turns in the primary versus the secondary windings, and the step up or step down ratio of the transformer. For example, if this is a 2:1 step down transformer with 700 turns in the primary winding, the secondary winding will have 350 turns.    Since power is conserved, and power equals voltage x current, a 2:1 step down transformer also steps the current up 2:1.    Anyway, current = voltage / resistance. So, the current in the secondary is 200 volts / 15 ohms = 13.33 amps. And, the power in the secondary is 200 volts x 13.33 amps = 2,666 watts.    And, if the power in the secondary is 2,666 watts, the power in the primary is also 2,666 watts.

j4sU4Gpgaa	alright here we go  as far as multiplayer goes the stand out is Left 4 Dead great multiplayer and a pretty interesting single player... now when i say interesting in no way am i talking about story this is one thing this game lacks... just run about shooting zombies    Far Cry 2 i can not say much other than from people that i have heard that have played the game they say it is too short for their taste and that the first Far Cry was much much better    Fallout 3 is an amazing game that is beautiful in every since of the word... my only gripe is that is much like Oblivion... i played it right after i fully completed Oblivion and all the expansions putting in more than 200 hours into the game so i was kind of burnt out on it... went back about a month later and played the game and was blown away everything about it was awesome... however unlike Oblivion once you complete the main story you can not go back and fiddle around with the world    Skate 2 is, once again, an awesome game as far as skating games go... i played the first Skate and the demo of Skate 2... i have also heard nothing but good things from people who have purchased the game and come back into the store to get another... great controls i really liked the replay feature where you can look back at tricks you just did    all around 4 really great games but i would suggest Fallout 3    anything about them i didnt answer for you feel free to email me    sorry for the lack of punctuation also|`|4LtszRxEaa	Well Fallout 3 I think will be your best bet. Left 4 Dead was kind of dumb because it got repitive just pretty much the same thing as Nazi Zombies in COD5 and that was a minigame.

There is a lot to do in Fallout 3, far more things than Far Cry 2.  Skate 2 looks like it might be fun,  I just don't care for skateboard games.  I can't think of anything bad about Fallout 3.  It is very fun.      Hope I helped!|`|q6uyloYdaa	My personal favorite of the group is Fallout 3. If you only have money for one game, then Fallout will give you the most bang for you buck. There is SO much you can do, so many places to go, and the game can seem endless (in a good way). If you're into playing online, however, you don't get that fix with Fallout. It's one-player only.  Left 4 Dead, however, is on the opposite end of the spectrum. It has a single-player campaign, but its strength is in the online play. You can play with up to 4 people killing zombies, etc.  Skate 2 is awesome too, but I already have Skate and found the two games to be too similar. I would recommend the game, but wait until it goes down in price.  I have not personally played Far Cry 2 but as an employee at a game shop I have noticed that people get their fill of it pretty quickly.    So basically what I mean to say is, buy Fallout 3.

qGfAlDd2aa	Sure, put up a good old fashioned TV antenna and get them free over the air.  Because the Over The Air signals are not as compressed as satellite or cable, they will look better. too.

Type your address into it and it will show you a map of what towers and channels you could get with an antenna.    It will also show you if you can use an indoor or need an outdoor antenna and what type.    www.antennaweb.org    If you can use an indoor antenna - try the Phillips Silver Sensor - Classic for about $23 on line.    For an external antenna the Wineguard antennas have a good reputation.      NOTE: You can always down-grade to basic cable service for about $30/month.  With my system this inclluded a 16 hour HD DVR and about 7 HDTV channels which had all the major ABC, NBC, CBS, etc which is what I watch 90% of the time.    Try calling your cable company first and down-grade to minimal service that includes HD.  (And threatening to quit might get you some extras if you stay on.)

No it doesn't brake easy, the only reason i don't have mine anymore is cuz i dropped it in the bath and then it still works after like a week. Yes, you can get internet on it and yes it works good! Hope I help! They are good at Internet use and yes I get on the Internet on mine. I think they are great phones. I had a lime green 1.|`|6rHhrcWGaa	theyre very problematic, but once you swap enough phones with verizon and get a good one....its a good phone|`|L0rnAJKFaa	My friend had this phone for about a year.<br>  Hers just stopped charging. So she's spending the rest of the 2 year contract without a phone.<br>  It texts somewhat easy if you don't use a keyboard.<br>  Not sure about the internet.<br>  My friend's spoiled, but I've never seen her on the internet on it.<br>  So I don' think so. <br>  But over all for a 13 year old.<br>  Oh wait. <br>  It's the flip chocolate, not the slider. Never mind then.
kRbkiPvnaa	Sprint uses CDMA and your iphone is GSM, they are not compatible. You can use it with other GSM carriers after you unlock it such as T-mobile and ATT, or it can be used in other countries that have GSM.  The only reason I use an unlocked phone is to be able to purchase local prepaid sims in other countries as I travel.|`|ZDK7Le3qaa	Yes you can.  You have to use a Sprint sim card though.  And why would you want to do that when ATT has a Gophone that is cheap and reliable?   If you are looking for cheap, go with the GoPhone Sim card.  They are 3 bucks on Ebay.

xwSNEYICaa	I would just buy a controller and memory card, if you already have a Wii.  Every gamecube game can be played on the Wii, so unless you plan on playing it on a different tv than your Wii is on, just stick with the controller and memory card (both can be picked up cheap.)    All of the Mario Party games are fun and my kids pull them out and play them quite often (4-8, the GameCube and Wii versions).  The only other GameCube games they play anymore besides Mario Party are Sonic DX and Super Smash Brothers Melee (because we already had it, and their older brother took his Smash Brothers Wii when he moved out).      Hope this helps!|`|LnYr2dLfaa	It's cheaper and easier to play on your Wii, so just buy a Gamecube controller or 2 and a Gamecube memory card (if you plan to save and load data).

KiVENZoBaa	You must have Wii points in order to buy a song. Each song costs about 200 Wii Points.

Just send it in and have them fix it for free because if you do something wrong and brake it they wont fix it and you will be without an xbox.
Hzv5jiVLaa	no, it means that your phone company might charge you for downloading stuff.<br>  you really have to find out how much it costs because it will run your phone bill up hundreds of dollars if u go crazy
pRX631gCaa	no you will need a cable that fits the camera which is generally one either the same shape as or made specifically for the camera in question if you dont have this cable i would buy one from the manufacture for an electroncis store like best buy or radioshack so you can get your pictures off or if that not an option get a usb memory card reader that should let you download the pictures as well|`|Gem96NQyaa	If it can connect to the camera and to the computer, it will work.

LThcbFoGaa	Mirrored should be fine -- if you're not getting anything on the TV, lower your screen resolution (Control Panel > Display > Settings). If that doesn't work, try selecting extended desktop. Then you can see what resolution the TV wants -- your problem might be that your laptop's LCD can't support the resolution that the TV supports.

2235a96a63c564e70804806a305bcd5aaa	Sony discontinued the Mylo-2. I have a mylo 2 takes you to the same internet both ipod and mylo have flaws I would wait for updated versions really. <br>  <br>  Memory isn't bad if you thing about it the mylo has 1gb inside but can take a memory stick up to 16gb and the sticks aren't too expensive and hold a lot I prefer it better then built in drives anyways because of portability and cross computability.<br>  <br>  Free wifi is from only a certain company its called way (something something I don't know the exact name but its available a certain hotels, at Mcdonalds, etc) free wifi for a year with that company. Doesn't matter if you go to a restaurant like panaras breads they give free wifi and you can use it on the mylo. If you have an att account with dsl you can use wifi free at starbucks. At home you can use it with your wireless router its like a laptop wifi chip.
tzySIuZvaa	First: The design is different and is supposed to be "sleeker" and fit better in your hand.<br>  <br>  Second: Volume control buttons are added onto the left side of the iPod to change the volume up and down.<br>  <br>  Third: A speaker (not visible, located inside the iPod) that is not very powerful, but is a great addition when it is quiet enough to listen to it.<br>  <br>  Fourth: The new iPod also comes with Nike + iPod support, which is explained further at <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/." rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/.</a><br>  <br>  Fifth: The battery life is also a little bit better on the newer iPod touch. It adds one hour of battery life for videos (to make it 6) and many more hours (I believe 15, to make it 36 hours total) of battery life for music.<br>  <br>  Also, the price is much lower. 8GB is $229, 16 GB is $299 (same price as the previous generation 8GB iPod touch), and the 32 GB iPod is $399 (same price as the previous generation 16GB iPod touch).<br>  <br>  <br>  *Some covers fit on the 1st Generation but others don't.<br>  *You have to pay a fee to get the App Store on the first generation iPod touch.<br>  *Connect your iPod to iTunes and follow the on-screen directions!|`|r8HAHhgkaa	it should fit just fine and yes the app store works with the 1G|`|9MBJXDBUaa	They are the same size. The only difference is the 2nd gen has a speaker and some of the apps don't work on the 1st gen that do on the  2nd gen.|`|AgsU0Eyvaa	The second is sleeker and more curved, so it might now.
mZlPj8Guaa	First off, I hope you bought the phone from a reliable person on E-Bay. Usually someone who has experience selling on E-Bay with this particular product. I also hope it has a valid ESN. Did you check that? A reputable person would send you the ESN AFTER the final price was agreed upon.<br>  <br>  Second, the person sent it probably First Class Mail. Phones do not weigh all that much. If the phone is on the other side of the world? Well, good luck. Sometimes they get stolen. Then it is an entirely different ball game.<br>  <br>  Third, I hope you used Paypal. At least you will have some protection from shady characters. Although my experience is mixed on Paypal. You have to wait 2 weeks before making any claims.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. Chances are, you will receive the phone. But give it a few more days.

Hzv5jiVLaa	you are one of the suckers of the retail camera buisness.<br>  because for some reason people think that they need a 10 mp camera to take just regular pictures of yourself and friends and stuff like that. if your not printing the pictures and your just putting them on facebook you only need 5 or less mp. because when you put a 10 mp picture on the internet it gets the quality taken down to a 1 mp quality because it takes too much space. hope it helps.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	We have a Canon A590IS, and it is great. It is not pink, it is silver. It is a good camera, with everything that you want.

It is called an ESN change. Just call to make sure get the ESN or MEID number for the phone before you buy it and that you call Verizon and let them run the ESN or MEID on the phone to make sure that it is not on a Lost/Stolen list or otherwise unable to activate. If it is good, then you can buy the phone and activate it for free. If you want to change you phone number, that is called an MDN change and usually costs $15 unless you can prove that you are getting harassing or obscene calls on your old number.|`|a8hbGnlOaa	just buy the phone online and tell them your current phone is giving you problems and you got a different phone to replace it i have never bin charged for doing that but my friend once got charged $15 for doing it idk y i didnt maybe because i said i had broken my phone and had got the new one from my brother

VJ1C5JsYaa	Alright yes you can get on live with your original Xbox. However the only way that you can get on now is by using a credit card. The Xbox Live Cards will not work on the original Xbox anymore. So once you have done that you should have no problems connecting to Live. As I currently have a 360 and use live on the I can not tell you how popular games are on the Xbox anymore. Im sure there are still people playing the popular games such as Halo 2 and ECT. but on the less popular games I don't think you will find to much. The connection should be the same as it use to be maybe a little worse though. If you consider the fact that you find less people on the original Xbox Live that would mean the the connections are more spread out then it use to be so your connection will be slightly slower in game due to that fact.|`|MHazHRGRaa	yeah you can|`|ArYmcAXBaa	yea it depends what games you want to play...<br>  <br>  but there is a fare bit of lag with some oh the games...<br>  <br>  i personally play halo,halo 2, rally sport challenge 2 and one of the ghost recon games<br>  <br>  just connect up and see what games are available for online play that you have<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|BqCE9Jmlaa	you cant go on xbox 360 live on the regular xbox

sER6UGMWaa	well right now there in the process of transitioning into new models so they will mark down floor models if you want a good deal on last years models|`|usIma0vIaa	First, the best day of the week to buy an airline ticket? Get on the phone at 1 in the morning on a Wednesday. Fares start going up on Fridays, then they head back down on Wednesday. So why do you have to stay up ‘til 1am? Because the 24 hour windows to buy are reloaded right after midnight.<br>  So, when’s the best time to buy a TV or a new stereo? During the month of April. That’s because the fiscal year for most Japanese manufacturers ends in March, and they roll out the new models right afterwards. So, April is when they slap deep discounts on last-year’s models. <br>  And guess what - the best time to buy a house is right now! Fewer people shopping for homes in winter, because they’re reluctant to pull their kids out of school in the middle of the year. And because the beautiful curb-appeal gardens that get people excited about houses don’t look that great during the cold weather. But that also means you’ll have less competition, and you’re more likely to get a better price.                   <br>  Another buying tip: You’ll find great deals on toys in August, when retailers are clearing their shelves for the holiday season. <br>  And if you are a videogame fan, you’ll get the best deals by buying last year’s holiday releases in June or July. <br>  To recap, buy airline tickets on Wednesday, houses in the winter, televisions in April, videogames in June, and toys in August. And before you know it, you’ll be saving all kinds of money.|`|AA10179458	Actually right now. Since retailers are hurting they are more willing to work with you. First thing you need to do is find out what kind of TV you want and then make and model. I suggest getting a good idea before going to a store. Honestly I would check with Best Buy and see what kind of deal they will make you. TVS are a high margin item and they have plenty of wiggle room on them. The higher end the TV the more margin on it. Keep that in mind when you go to the store. When you talk to the salesman ask to speak to the manager and see what kind of deal you can get. Go in there prepared, have a price in mind and prepare to negotiate.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Now or waiting for Black Friday.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Black Friday :)

You find the lamp first during the day and in the evenings a bubble pops up with someone talking to you and asks you to come closer. You can't see him until you get close enough to him. Then he will talk to you some more asking you for the lamp. Show it to him and he will want you to bring him to your attack.

MJ7bvyxAaa	Look in to the XDCAM-EX line.  We have the PDW-F330 (the pro-disc line).  One drawback is that it shoots native at 1440x1080, then stretches the frame to 1920 for playback. But very good compression, multiple framerates available, swappable lenses. Durable to hurricane-strength winds? Not too sure. <br>  <br>  But we've used it for the last year with no issues.
AA10179458	You will probably get between 50 and 100 bucks for it. Since the TV is tiny and is an older tube TV it isn't going to fetch much and a DVD player can be had for 50 bucks brand new.

C5EPlZ8saa	If you're receiving the call from someone in Canada during the offpeak (Night or Weekend) time frame, you're not going to see any charge, nor have the amount of time talking to the individual count against your minute allowance.

I had the experience of being charged what I thought was an outrageous amount on my Verizon Wireless bill when I got a call from Vancouver BC.

c3b645N5aa	I would actually get the Nikon D40, you'll save some money AND get better pictures because of the fewer megapixels....
HBNx77BBaa	Ken Rockwell also strongly recommends the A590IS. OK, it's bit bigger, but you can't really put any camera in your pocket - they get damaged. You could get two A590IS cameras for the price of an SD880IS and still have change left for memory cards. Get the smallest case you can to clip on your belt or tuck away inside a bag.<br>  <br>  The A590IS doesn't go wide though, like the SD790 it starts at 35mm. For newspaper work you might find it a bit of a squeeze getting groups of people in a picture if you can't step back far enough. Most of your work will be closer up, so it won't often be a problem.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	There will be newer model from Canon out around April.I think the price of SD880 IS would be drop down.However if you happy with it then get one.The technology moves so fast,it hard to catch it.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fp%26field-keywords%3Dsd880%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Dphoto&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|vQOFU4vCaa	I haven't seen print comparisons of the two but I really hate the design of the 790. It is really ugly and the buttons are stupid to me, they are kind of like the buttons on the old razor cell phone, like stubs of the metal that are flexible. Any way I don't know if you really care about the aesthetics of the camera itself but it is something that I am concerned about since I think I would use a camera more often if it is good looking and not distracting with it awkward design.

6WLu6H99aa	When you say frame rate issues, you mean that it simply skips around on ya? It could be the laser reader. But if the disc is doing it - you should try another disc and see if you have the same problem. if not, its more than likely the ps3 and the warranty should cover that for factor defect if you haven't modified the system at all physically in a way you aren't supposed to.<br>  <br>  As for the bonus question, you're fine. Most damage it did was confuse it. Just try not to do that if ya can ;)|`|dsehc7gAaa	Ok! here is all i know! when you eject a disk before the game is done completely, its fine because it boots you to the main menu and that is how the consoles are designed. it would probably be the system, so i would take it in or report exactly what happens whenever you do what you do and it freaks out.|`|9sRUf4zEaa	On the first question it can be either problem. From my experience, it might mean the disk is just dirty. Also, the ps3 might be slightly overheated so just turn off the system for a bit, and try resuming playing in a more open area than before. If that doesn't help, try playing different games on the ps3, it's possible the problem is with the laser. Worst case is you need to send the ps3 in to sony. <br>  <br>  As for the bonus question if there's any damage it's going to be on the ps3. However, nothing should be affected. The worst that happened to me when something like that happened was the ps3 was confused and automatically went to standby mode. Other than that, the disk was fine and the system booted up normally with all the content intact.|`|b4mhcOy6aa	this happens when the processing cant quite keep up with whats happening in the game. <br>  think of it as if the processors have a certain amount of work they can do in a period of time and they just don't quite manage to get it all done in time this can be seen as a frame rate slow down or sometimes incorrectly displayed objects and scenery details.<br>  try cooling ur ps3 a little. keeping ur disks clean doesn't hurt either as bluray disks have much more information on them per square inch so each scratch and finger print is very bad for it.

Maybe two separate speaker wires are touching somewhere or maybe you have the polarity backwards. Also make sure the wires are not pinched somewhere (speaker end & receiver end).

But first of all you have to convert the movie into MP4 so your iPod can recognize it. Remember that the format is very important, it has to be MP4.<br>  <br>  Steps are as follows:<br>  Convert the movies into MP4. Once done open your iTunes and the folder with MP4 movies.

AA10179458	Basic cable is fairly inexpensive from any provider. That being said, if you are looking for cable then there will only be one cable provider in your area. Cable works on territories and only 1 provider can be in an area. There are alternatives such as satellite TV or services such as Verizon Fios. If you have High Definition then Verizon Fios is the way to go. If you have regular standard definition then any provider will be fine. Basic cable will probably run around fifty dollars a month.|`|usIma0vIaa	Benefits<br>  Wall mounting a television can free up a lot of space and allow you to put a television in a very small space without using a stand or table. Flat screen televisions hang so nicely on the wall they resemble a picture frame and only stick out about 3 to 4 inches from the wall. Larger televisions can be corner mounted so they are higher and take up less space in the room. Probably the only type of television that can't be wall mounted would be a large tube big screen. <br>  Types<br>  There are many kinds of wall mounting hardware kits available, and the one you choose depends on what type and size of television is being mounted. For a tube television up to 32 inches, the mount has a bracket that fastens to the wall using screws, then a bar or arm that extends to hold a shelf or flat surface that the television sits on, and there are usually straps to hold the television onto the shelf. For flat screen televisions of any size, a wall mounting kit includes flat metal pieces that are individually screwed into the wall and must be arranged according to where you want the television and how you want it to hang; most flat screen televisions come ready to mount with areas on the back designed to attach to the mount. Along with the mounting hardware for either type of television, special equipment is sold separately for wire covering, and attaches to the wall below the television and runs down to the outlet so the wires slip down through the cover, which blends in with the wall. <br>  Considerations<br>  Television wall mounting kits and hardware can be found at most electronic stores, major general stores that sell televisions, online electronic stores, home improvement stores and furniture stores. When buying a kit for mounting a flat screen television, be sure to know the size of the television because the kits are labeled according to what size TV is being mounted. Measuring the bottom length and width of a tube television is a good idea to make sure the flat shelf on the wall mount is large enough to safely hold the television. The wire covers are sold at home improvement or hardware stores. <br>  Function<br>  Wall mounting kits come with very detailed instructions that should be followed to ensure the securest mounting possible. You will need a leveler and a stud finder; these can be purchased at a hardware store. A leveler is a small tool with fluid and a floating ball in it that will ensure the television is hung straight. A stud finder is a handheld tool that you slowly rub against the wall where the television is being mounted to locate the beams that you will drill into, because the drywall alone cannot hold up a television. The stud finder will sound an alarm when it has found a beam, and you will want to use a pencil to mark the beams in the wall. Once you have the studs marked, decide how high you want the television and mark where you want the top of the television to be. Now you can measure the areas on the back of the television to see how much distance there is between the attachment brackets and the top of the television. Measure down the same distance from the pencil mark you made for the top and that is where the brackets will be attached to the beams in the wall. When attaching the brackets, use the level on the top of each bracket to make sure you have it straight before using screws to fasten it to the wall. The mounting kit will have diagrams with very easy to follow instructions, and most televisions come with mounting instructions specific to that type of television. After all the brackets are in place the television can be hung or set up on the mount. <br>  Expert Insight<br>  When mounting a tube television, make sure to fasten the bracket and stand high enough that you can walk under it without hitting your head. When purchasing a flat screen television, make sure it is mountable, if it is, it will have areas in the back to attach to the mounting brackets. Most electronic stores offer professional mounting that can be scheduled at the time of purchase. Wire covers can be painted to match the wall and become almost invisible. You can also wallpaper a boarder over the cover or decorate it to really blend in with the wall and the room. Wall mounting a television really makes a room look classy and is a great way to avoid the clutter of a floor stand. You can put up shelves to hold other electronics that are hooked up to the television, and this really frees up space in a room. <br>  Ads by Google<br>  TV Wall Mounts - 50% Off<br>  S0NY, Vizio, LG, Panasonic & More.

GZ5ZEDfZaa	The PLL is the chip that sets the frequencies of the FSB, ram, PCI express bus, and PCI bus.  The advice most sites give is to open up your computer and then look at the PLL and write down the manufacturer and model number.  (How  you know what chip is the PLL is provided in source.)  However, this can be quite the pain in the ***, and there is another method.  It consists of process of elimination.  The method is also included in the source.  If you use said method, you'll need something that tells you info on your computers current frequencies, like CPU Z.  If this doesn't do it, just google how to find your PLL.

Do you know where the system was stopped at? To find that out connect your modem to the 360 again and do "test connection" tell us where it was stopped at and what it says.<br>  <br>  Once you edit your post to include more information we maybe able to help you more.

AQ4b4Iilaa	Sony A200 with 18-70mm lens is $499.<br>  <br>  The D40 does not have an auto-focus motor built into its body. You need to buy lenses with a motor built into the lens or you are stuck with manual focus. Most Nikon lenses ever produced do not have an AF motor so you will not be able to buy cheap old 35mm SLR lenses off eBay etc., that work fully with the D40.<br>  <br>  The Sony A200 has an auto-focus motor built into the camera body, as in common with most dSLRs. Any twenty year old Minolta AF lens bought second-hand will work on the A200.<br>  <br>  The D40 does not have image stabilisation in the body. The Sony does have image stabilisation in the body. So ANY lens, including those old Minolta AF lenses, you put on the A200 will use the A200's stabilisation.<br>  <br>  The D40 has a poorer implementation of multi-point autofocus. The D40 can not do bracketing. The D40 does not have sensor cleaning. The D40 has less mpix. The D40 is basically a crippled version of a good Nikon dSLR.<br>  <br>  It does not makes any sense to buy a Nikon D40 over a Sony A200.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Nikon D40 is your best choice.Pictures quality are great.Light & Compact,easy to use.If you can pay a little bit more get Nikon D40 with 2 lens 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX and 55-200mm f/4.5-5.6G ED AF-S DX Zoom for $550 <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fp%26field-keywords%3Dnikon%2520d40%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|tsq5P9pzaa	I agree.

fyGIGII4aa	Toshiba Gigabeat MES30VW would be my pic out of those two.<br>  <br>  Toshiba Gigabeat MES30VW:<br>  <br>  The good:  The Toshiba Gigabeat S makes its mark as a supercompact 30GB or 60GB portable video player. It supports many music, video, and photo file types, including subscription services, and it has a bevy of features, such as an FM tuner and support for digital camera transfers. Best of all, the device is completely intuitive, thanks in part to an improved Portable Media Center operating system, and it boasts excellent sound performance.<br>  <br>  The bad: Unlike many portable video players, the Toshiba Gigabeat S does not record audio or video. There is no voice or FM recording, and the two-cable AC adapter is cumbersome. Also, the Gigabeat S is an MTP device and requires Windows XP. Finally, rated battery life for video is weaker than Toshiba had originally suggested. <br>  <br>  <br>  Toshiba Gigabeat V30 MEV30K:<br>  <br>  The good:  The Toshiba Gigabeat V offers audio, video, and photo playback in a slim and original form factor; PMC software is intuitive; solid processor performance; compatible with WMA Lossless; standard USB port; excellent audio quality; good battery life.<br>  <br>  The bad: The Toshiba Gigabeat V maxes out at 30GB; display is pixelated; thumb-stick controller not universally effective; cannot charge over USB; no FM radio or A/V recording; native video support limited to WMV.

I had the iPod mini and didn't get the warranty. The plu-in somehow became damaged, and to repair would cost more that the device. Most off the iPods are expensive to fix.

RiRjZKTcaa	IPod only accepts mp4 and H.264 video formats. So you should make sure your video is the iPod supported video format first.

tvbn6ViYaa	No, the needle gets worn down affecting the sound, and the record itself will get scratched up and effect the playing. Also torking the part that spins around could affect the whole turning mechanism causing it to go at the wrong speed or not at all
b7673c94005baecf140886e5fd79fa21aa	The razr is almost universally lambasted as a terrible phone, by those that own them.  The pros are that it looks really cool, and is slim.  I think the biggest cons are that the phone was designed with too little memory, so once you have a certain number of names in the phone it is intolerably slow.  For example, if I want to look up someone's number, I press the button and can count to 5 before something happens on the screen.  It is incredibly annoying.  I have asked several people at phone shops and they say the same thing (yeah - no memory, slow, annoying, bad phone).<br>  <br>  The form factor is nice though, but there are so many phones out there.  Do a little more research, esp. from someone who uses the phone.  It's too hard to figure out the quirks of a phone in the 1 hour you have to shop.  Best to find a phone-o-phile who loves their phone and ask them why.|`|42Rs1Lm1aa	It is! I own one and I havent had any problems with it.|`|4b7beb299a5a67e5c5f7f6005b232e0caa	It's a good phone.

wu2A5KHQaa	1.- El plan tarifario mas económico es el "sin fin" cuesta 185 c/iva al mes y se te dan 50 minutos, además puedes escoger 10 amigos frecuentes de telcel a nivel nacional, con los que podrás hablar max. 5 minutos las veces que quieras y sera gratis para los demás que no están en tu lista se te cobraran si son telcel a 1peso el minuto.La desventaja es que solo son equipos sencillos para este plan si quieres uno mejor pagas mas de renta. Te recomiendo en ′plan el GSM100 y/o el GSM100MIX.<br>  2.El equipo de amigo kit, si lo puedes pasar a sistema de "Plan libre", solo  debes de contar con la factura del equipo, la ventaja es que no hay plazo minimo forsozo, no necesitas tarjeta de credito o deposito en garantia.<br>  3.Los equipos de plan se activan en chips blancos, por lo que no es posible conservar el numero telefónico de AMIGO KIT.<br>  4. Si puedes liberar tu equipo para otra compa?ía móvil, aunque este en plan, la cuestión es que debes de estar cambiando el chip, ya que mientras tanto el tiempo transcurre. Pero una  liberación no te resta funciones, bueno excepto mensajes multimedia, ya que se direccionan al numero  de celular y el equipo.|`|ZQct0AAIaa	Hola, trataré de ayudarte con lo que yo se al respecto:<br>  <br>  1. el plan tarifario depende en parte de la "región" en la que te encuentres, de acuerdo a tu estado la cobertura de Telcel está dividida por regiones, te recomiendo que entres a su página y aquí checas todos los planes con sus beneficios.<br>  <a href="http://www.telcel.com/portal/telcel.portal?_nfpb=true&planesTarifariosPortlet_1_actionOverride=%2Fportlets%2FplanesTarifarios%2Fshow_renta_mensual_seleccion&_windowLabel=planesTarifariosPortlet_1&planesTarifariosPortlet_1tecnologiaId=100&_pageLabel=PRM_PlanesRentaPage" rel="nofollow">http://www.telcel.com/portal/telcel.port...</a><br>  <br>  2. respecto a esta pregunta sí es cierto puesto que al comprar el amigo kit tú ya eres due?a del equipo.<br>  <br>  3. no puedes conservar el mismo # de tu 'amigo' en plan tarifario y sí existe el "plan mix" y es tal como lo explicas, son determinado # de minutos y cuando se terminan tú recargas tiempo aire con tarjeta pre-pago. Nosotros lo tenemos en una empresa y es un medio para controlar el cosumo, ya que a nosotros sólo nos llega una renta mensual que nunca varía y si la persona se termina sus minutos ya depende de ellos si le ponen tarjeta o no.<br>  <br>  4. esta pregunta te la debo.<br>  <br>     Saludos.

zKNq9IA6aa	You have possibly three options at this time.  First  try to call Cingular cusotmer service and inquire about obtaining an unlock code from them.  Since Cingular does not carry this model there is a good chance they do not have the needed unlock code generator.  Your second option is to use one of the online unlocking shops such as gsmliberty.com or unlockitnow.com  For this particular model you need to use a special type of service cable to successfully unlock it, so you may end up simply mailing it to them, which will cost you around $15.00  Your third option is to call around local non-corporate cell phone shops.  Many smaller "mom and pop" shops have the tools needed to unlock your phone and usually charge about $10.00 or so.

AA12384163	The short answer to your question is "NO." It will not work there.<br>  <br>  The full answer is based upon chips embedded in the equipment for reception (CDMA) versus the standard in Europe being (GSM) sim cards.  The latter being older & cheaper to build with CDMA giving greater flexibility in capacity (calls upon a single thread) & encryption technology utilized at the onset of the call.<br>  <br>  Certain areas outside europe also utilize CDMA technology to transmit calls & verizon phones will work there.  Otherwise, the global phone program for rental or purchase is availalbe.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I would recommend waiting to your next renewal & buy your phone as a global & always be prepared, since no extra number will be given. Therefore, people will call you with the same number & never know unless you tell them where you are.<br>  <br>  Example:  Samsung 795 or Samsung I 830 (global pda device)|`|QCUa3868aa	No sorry you would need a global phone Verzion does have a global rental program  but you own equipment would not work of European Networks... sorry if you are interested in more information about the rentals call 800-922-0204 and ask to be transfer to global support.

There are usually around "75" channels in "HD" but the problem is that these companies overload their bandwidth with too much information (try to provide many HD channels without changing their current delivery system so accommodate the extra information being passed through their wires/satellites) so even the "HD" channels are usually not true "HD" or run on the lower end of HD so the picture will not match the quality of your DVD or blueray movies|`|M0yfMC79aa	You may need to set up your receiver to 1080i, very easy! check with the users manual. also make sure you have the proper HD cables installed, ie; HDMI, Y/PR/PB.

If you don't notice any difference it might not be broadcast in HD in your local networks. If all else fails call the retailer who installed it to check it out.

That phone you are ordering off eBay, means that its an outright purchase without the hassle of trapping yourself with AT&T under a contract.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to buy and when the phone is delivered to you, just pop in your existing SIM card and you are good to go!|`|AA10663850	It means that there is no commitment.

B5Ttmosfaa	I can't speak specifically for the MP-C596 as I can't find it anywhere hardly for sale, but I can speak on my opinion of Coby Electronic Products.  They are very cheaply made.  They are low priced for this reason.  There may be absolutely nothing wrong with the MP3 player you are considering but I have owned a few Coby Products and most memorable was a cordless phone.  I came in and went to answer the phone and a mild static spark went from my finger to the handset.  It rendered the handset and phone totally inoperable.  Coby was very poor about wanting to honor the warranty and it would have cost as much to ship it to them as it would to buy a new better made one.  Not worth it to me.  That left me with a poor opinion of Coby products.  I don't care for their stuff.  So you can take your chances if you like but just be wary of the possible quality.<br>  <br>  You might consider this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Player-Tuner-Voice-Recorder/dp/B000EWBW8I/ref=sr_1_92/105-5185563-4278851?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1185909621&sr=1-92" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Player-T...</a><br>  <br>  around the same price, good reviews from a few people, built in tuner and voice recorder too.

I don't like the camera's plug-ins and cables interface. If you plan to capture to the computer's hard disc, this is not the right camera. Indeed, the camera uses the AV cable, which is a three-banded stereo-type jack at the camera and it splits to 3 RCA mini jacks for the TV or tape machine. In Europe you have to buy an adapter for 3 plugs into that bastard, huge plug with the six sides.<br>  <br>  This cam does not have S-Video, so camcoder to camcoder connection isn't part of the system.<br>  <br>  Almost all video has to have editing so you don't put your buddies to sleep while you explain away all the stuff that should have been cut.<br>  <br>  My recommendation to capture on a PC is to look for Firewire (old, but universal), USB second (because you have to have modern software/hardware).  <br>  <br>  Again, I do like the camera itself. The other option would be this or a similar camera and investigate a miniDV player that would interface to PC with firewire or USB. I know when I bought my Sony DV camcoder, the Sony miniDV tape player was outrageously expensive just to playback to the TV.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I was blown away when I looked at Sony's HD miniDV for the price I paid for the original Sony miniDV.

TjUh8lQ1aa	I have the same problem, i did jailbreak too! It just froze on the apple symbol. I can turn it off but it won't go past the apple symbol!!! I am so mad!
jRzQpSBzaa	AT&T|`|aba4b874d24a79665f3707a39b53c4a2aa	At&t is the best company in the world and it have the best phones
0rwi3rSZaa	if you just complete a few quick tasks on this site they'll send you a playstation 3, completely free of charge!!|`|009c5bc7a2743108e4e4702250a0b06baa	If the name of the folder that contains the music is not one that the PS3 looks for (I believe the folder has to be either 'Audio' or 'Music') it wont find the data. You can however go to music, then go to the ipod device and press triangle and select display all. Once you do this you should be able to browse all folders on the device to find the one that contains music. This method also works for videos and pictures.
TNgLqKdlaa	Depending on your service provider, Unlimited Texting ranges anywhere from $10 to $20 a month. There are also cheaper texting plans, like 300 messages for $5 a month. So just find out which one works for you. Good Luck!|`|j0LITQMEaa	ARGGUUGG!!!!!!<br>  <br>  YOU ARE TOO VAUGE!!<br>  <br>  what provider are you with?<br>   <br>  we are not pyhics we don't know your business like that!!1 who are you with?<br>  <br>  if with at&t then a unlimited plan for a cell is 19.99<br>  <br>  GOSH please be more detailed in the future and for crying out loud save your points by going to the provider website and seeing it for yourself|`|vzLq8cq1aa	Well it really depends on your service provider. I think AT&T is like $10 but I might be wrong. Just go to the services website, its on there just look
L32UCVmhaa	Yes its possible, probably you can go to symbianism, there are many selections of musicplayers or any applications/games/themes for all phones..
4342b37ce6239527739754a9fb96b46daa	if your cell phone uses mp3 or wav file types as it's ringers you can use iTunes to create them.<br>  Here is how.<br>  -select the song you want to hear as a ringer,<br>  -listen and note the times in the song you want to be the ringer (start & end times)<br>  -get info on the song in iTunes, select the Options tab and check and enter in the start and end times<br>  -close the get info window<br>  -go to your preferences and set the import/convert to mp3/wav settings to custom (& make them very low)<br>  -under the advanced menu, select convert to mp3/wav<br>  -go back into the get info on the original song selected and uncheck the start/end times<br>  -select your newly created mp3/wav and put it someplace you will be able to find it later (ex: my documents/ringers)<br>  -repeat above until you have a good collection of ringers<br>  -go back into preferences and set your import/convert settings back to your original settings<br>  -now, if your phone supports bluetooth, you can upload them that way...if your phone has a memory card (ie: SD or microSD, etc) you can copy them to the card and then put the card in the phone and then copy them to the phone's internal memory...or if you have a USB data cable you can usually upload them to the phone using it.|`|S1dO8JBUaa	I think the best website for creating your own ringtone is 3Guppies.com. Once you upload they let you crop the 30 seconds you like. They do all the converting.
c9a355574073c7578e23427e361d367caa	you can play the Us Wii in Europe, but you will need the following:<br>  <br>  1) A multisystem television.  One that accepts PAL (European) and NTSC (US).  If you play an NTSC Wii on a PAL only TV, it will be in black and white<br>  <br>  2) A transformer that converts 110voltage to 220.  You can't get one of those traveling ones because they will melt away too quickly.  I ordered my transformer from Eurobatteries.com (<a href="http://shop.eurobatteries.com/power-supplies-acacbrtransformers-adaptors-c-45_61.html)" rel="nofollow">http://shop.eurobatteries.com/power-supp...</a> see the 0500w Transformer 230-110-230v.  Works like a charm!! Make sure to read the instructions because this transformer works as a 110 to 220 and vice versa.  It may be a little pricey, but it is worth it.<br>  <br>  You might need to get a plug adapter, I don't know how the plugs look in Polad... but that should be easy to find at any electronic store.  Other than that, you should be good.  Unless your Wii is modded, don't buy the PAL games in Europe.
ObKWbKfHaa	U have to go to mobile shop!!!<br>  No other way i think!!!
HMymITfhaa	Solo metele el chip y lo puedes usar como tu quieras.|`|q5Ag3pGXaa	Si, si puedes ponerle una tarjeta de prepago, ya sea de Telcel o Movistar...o de cualquier parte del mundo. Tambien puedes usarlo para accesar el EDGE, pero eso tiene un costo extra (creo que son .07 centavos por byte transmitido....04 centavos si es con plan).

nSGEyiywaa	unless you can remember the original password you have two options....... whoever your cell company is, go see them in the store and ask them to help you find a way to reset that password.... depending on who you speak to they may know the answers.....<br>  <br>  otherwise you may have to resort to doing a hard reset which will delete EVERYTHING off your phone, contacts, passwords, emails.... everything.... but it will completely reset it......<br>  <br>  hard resets are LAST resort!   See if you can speak with customer care or someone in the store who can help..... each phone is different so they could possibly help you in the store|`|1WYt9afNaa	all I can say is....<br>  <br>  sorry hun, u will need a new phone
wrsdgAPHaa	With verizon, mobile im works the same as an out of network text.  So if you have a text package with 500 out of network texts, each mobile IM takes away from the 500.  So, if you get unlimited texting to all networks, mobile IM is included.  Good luck convincing your parents to let you text.  Maybe try to get them to put a text package on your line and you pay for the additional charge?<br>  good luck|`|nSGEyiywaa	if your parents won't let you text, they won't let you......<br>  <br>  The only plan I can think of that will INCLUDE everything is the NATIONWIDE PREMIUM plans....<br>  <br>  but if you are on a family share plan with your parents then you MOST likely will NOT be able to get put on it cuz then your parents will have to be on it ALSO, and I'm sure they won't want to pay for things they won't use!<br>  <br>  If your on your own plan then get one of the NATIONWIDE PREMIUM plans!<br>  <br>  It will incude texting and IMing and mobile web!<br>  <br>  The only thing you would have to pay EXTRA for is ringtones/wallpapers/games that you download! (so don't download them!)<br>  <br>  But if your parents aren't willing to pay extra then your pretty much outta luck, especially if your're on a family share plan! Cuz ALL the lines have to be on the family share nationwide premium if you want to be able to use those things..... and I'm sure your parents will NOT want their lines to be on the premium plans!|`|7Yacmj7eaa	well the main part of the enV is the texting. that's the whole point to get the phone. don't even get if you can't text. <br>  tell your parents that if they don't let you text they are pretty much wasting their money because that's the huge thing for the phone. <br>  and texting isn't even that much.
5OHIhWlzaa	My old u740 was perfect and then it got washed in the washing machine and I sent away for a new one. The new one works fine except I have the same exact problem. It vibrates an extremely short time and its irritating because I miss many texts now. The ring tone vibrates normally, it is just the text messages. I really hope there is a way to fix this.|`|nSGEyiywaa	hmmm... that's weird.....  are you sure that it's for texts??? Or is it for ALERTS like email alerts????<br>  <br>  Cuz my u740 works fine for texting, but whenever I get an email alert it will only vibrate once or do a short noise if I have the volume up.
nSGEyiywaa	that's strange. Try pulling your battery out, wait like 10 seconds and then put it back in and start the phone up again. Go back in and see if you can delete it after that. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work you'll need to take it to a corporate verizon store and depending on if it's still doing that they'll probably swap it out for a warranty unit since this sounds like a possible manufacturers defect. (Don't worry they can switch your contacts over to the new phone)|`|rtKkMSRkaa	I don't think so.  Call your carrier.
0CrvjDNEaa	i think you have to ring your network company ...|`|nSGEyiywaa	nope, there is no way to see what the numbers are that you are texting to. There was a way with Nextel like 3 years ago, but I think they switched theirs and now you can't view it anymore.|`|rtKkMSRkaa	No.|`|ju9OHfU2aa	Not that I know of
vSj6v1Zwaa	You will not be able to "jailbreak" the 3G iPhone.  It has to be activated at the time of purchase in the store.  Also, it will already come with the ability to play games and have other software available so you shouldn't HAVE to jailbreak it.
AA10796568	i'd say the en-v (if you like to text a lot)|`|nSGEyiywaa	I played around with the Venus in my store and I despise it. You can't set any sort of sensitivity control on the touch screen and sometimes you have to hit the touch screen multiple times because of this. AND you can't set the vibration level on it either. (the chocolate lets you set if you want it to vibrate low, med or high)....<br>  <br>  I have the enV for a business phone and I LOVE it. I don't even care if it's got a small screen and it's not a flip or slider. I LOVE the full keyboard!|`|SLaUqHlWaa	The EnV for sure ! <br>  I just got the my EnV 2 months ago .<br>  I love it !!!<br>  Its really good for texting.<br>  Thats part of the reason i got it because i loveeeee texting!!|`|Xi8iTE2Faa	EnV<br>  all the way<br>  yeh the forn screen is small<br>  but <br>  it open up and there is a big screen in there<br>  id personaly just go get the samsung alias, big screen good txt phone|`|eR2sHpsSaa	the venus only has one small touch screen<br>  it's replaces the up down right left button<br>  you can't type on it<br>  <br>  it's a slider phone, it slides open to a normal keypad to text on<br>  <br>  i suggest the voyager<br>  it's the best parts of the env and venus in one
pl2SocVKaa	ps3 the game's run smoother and it's exclusive's are just as good as 360(resistance 1, upcoming 2 ,ratchet Killzone 2, Bioshock) if you are looking for games right now probably 360 but the future of gaming looks like it's heading toward the Ps3.choose Ps3|`|dN92JApxaa	Ps3, you can play all your other resident evil games on it too. And if you dont wanna pay for online then go with the ps3. Its pretty much up to par with live except maybe a cross game invite system but thats not worth 50$ to me. Your already paying for internet, why pay more? Plus any games that really matter are multiplat or on the ps3. People say halo and gears and mass effect but thats also on computer. Theres also a solid lineup for the rest of this year and well into next year. So id suggest a ps3. <br>  ps. resident evil 5 looks AMAZING|`|EsDg4Kbgaa	Get the one with the games you want. Xbox live is only $50 for a full year and  in most cases is superior to Playstation's online service. The 360 has some good RPGs if you want something different from Final Fantasy like Mass Effect and Oblivion (it's on the PS3 but the 360 has an exlusive expasion pack that adds a new world and over 100hrs of gameplay).|`|aHBvi56Uaa	You know you just asked a comparison question on the playstation section. Most if not all the answers are going to be the ps3. Mine is not going to be any different. <br>  <br>  I just like mine. It's plain awesome. The xbox just blows. To me the xbox makes this dumb *** sound almost like when your vista computer starts up.|`|TenzGU1Saa	Ps3! It has Tekken6 and FF13!|`|50qeHJiHaa	Get a PS3 because<br>  ps3 has a built-in blu-ray player (360 does not<br>  <br>  -ps3 supports 1.3 HDMI which has rich colors and xbox supports 1.2 HDMI<br>  <br>  - ps3 has much more and better exclusives, most of them cant go to xbox 360 because it cant handle that many data(DVD- 8.5gb, blu-ray 50gb)<br>  <br>  - because of the blu-ray's huge space, ps3 will have WAY better graphics than 360<br>  <br>  - online is free for ps3 not like 360<br>  <br>  - ps3 will have over 300 games released by this spring<br>  <br>  - you can browse the internet on ps3, no such thing for xbox 360<br>  <br>  - playstation home is coming out this spring, its a virtual community where you can hang out with friends and customize your own apartment which xbox doesnt have(FREE)<br>  <br>  - ps3 is a true HD console. xbox 360 upscale games to 1080p and ps3 DISPLAY games up to 1080p<br>  <br>  - built in Wi-Fi ( not on 360)<br>  <br>  - xbox 360: 33% hardware failure<br>  ps3: .2% hardware failure(see the decimal? less than 1%!)<br>  <br>  - ps3 has better back-comp except the 40gb<br>  <br>  - xbox 360 already has been maxed out to its potential with gears of war. ps3 has not been maxed out yet- look at uncharted drakes fortune, better graphics than gears and its only 30% of ps3’s potential<br>  <br>  - you can upgrade your harddrive without voiding warranties with any 2.5 HDD, which xbox cant because you have to buy a xbox HDD<br>  (they actually have the step by step on how to upgrade it on playstation.com)<br>  <br>  those are the ones that i know right off my mind but there are much more reason than this<br>  <br>  Now I want you to do me a favor, list all the reasons why xbox is better than ps3. I PROMISE you that nobody will get at least 5 reasons<br>  <br>  if you get ps3, look at this, you will be able to play metal gear solid 4, haze, killzone 2, resistance 2(60 player online!!!!), final fantasy XIII, motorstorm 2, little big planet, better version of GTA IV, god of war 3, uncharted drake's fortune, heavenly sword, ratchet and clank, SOCOM: confrontation, gran turismo 5, ETC- <a href="http://news.filefront.com/ps3-exclusives..." rel="nofollow">http://news.filefront.com/ps3-exclusives...</a><br>  <br>  All 360 has is Gears of War 2 and ...

Xbox 360 and Wii are so weak from technological point of view, that in couple of years they won't be capable of dealing with serious graphics. GTA IV, for instance, Was not even announced for Wii - this toy won't be able to cope with the game's requirements. <br>  <br>  Let's compare PS3 and XBOX 360:<br>  <br>  1). A third of XBOX 360 (33%) are malfunctioning right from the start. PS3 return rate is only around 0.2%. Despite some people say, that new 360 has no breakdown issues - just visit Xbox section of Yahoo answers and see for yourself an amount of complaints.<br>  2). PS3 has 7 kernels in Cell processor, Xbox 360 -only 3.<br>  3). PS3 uses advanced tech called Blu-Ray, one disc can store up to 25 (single layer) and dual layer 54 gb (in the future - up to 200 gb), Xbox 360 - regular dual layer DVD-9 (8.5GB). It's possible to get HD-DVD (max. - 30GB) for 360, but it'll cost you around 50$. Besides, HD-DVD had lost the format war with Blu-ray. Toshiba had stopped to manufacture them, Microsoft too.<br>  4). Calculations per sec - PS3 - 51-billion-dot-product-operati... per second<br>  Xbox 360 - 33.6-billion-dot-product-opera... per second<br>  5). PS3 has full media support - USBs, built-in 4 slots card reader (except 20GB and 40GB versions), ability to use printer and so on.<br>  Xbox 360 has USBs and only 2 memory slots.<br>  6). PS3 supports up to 7 Bluetooth Controllers<br>  Xbox 360 - up to 4 Controllers<br>  7). PS3 - wi-fi included (except 20 gb version)<br>  Xbox 360 - wi-fi will cost you around 100 $<br>  8). From the first technical sight - graphics are stronger in 360 (it has a stronger graphics chip - Xenos), BUT PS3 can use it's Cell CPU for graphics too, which gives you better graphics in total. PS3 uses a weaker RSX chip, that was developed by Nvidia exclusively for PS3. RSX runs on 550 Mhz. It's difficult to compare their graphics, because 360 has a video chip with totally different structure and operating memory is divided differently in both consoles. Xbox isn't that versatile in dividing tasks between CPU and GPU as PS3. That's why PS3 exclusives look better than 360's exclusives.<br>  9). Xbox 360 is widely known for so-called "red ring of death" problem - it gets overheated easily. My PS3 was running for more than 15 hours non-stop with no problems. Sometimes Xbox 360 becomes so overheated, that thermopaste on CPU melts, drips on motherboard and successfully shortcircuits it. That's why in some countries people call Xbox 360 "Coffin 360".<br>  10). In 2008 PS3 will get more than 300 games, including Metal Gear Solid 4, The Agent and other great exclusives. Here is the good link to the future PS3 releases. <a href="http://ps3.ign.com/index/release.html......" rel="nofollow">http://ps3.ign.com/index/release.html......</a><br>  11). PS3 online is free, Xbox 360 - you have to pay.<br>  12). There were reports, that 360 scratches discs. No reports on that in PS3.<br>  13). The funniest thing, that right now there are no games for PS3, that show full potential of the console. Biggest games weigh only 25 GB (Xbox 360 will need more than 3 discs even for those).<br>  14). On PS3 you can install other OS, such as Linux Yellow Dog, Ubuntu and others. Sony officially lets you do it. There is no such thing in 360.<br>  15). PS3 HDD can be replaced easily with any 2.5" SATA 5400 RPM HDD (used in laptops). 250 GB will cost you around 170$. In 360 you have to buy exclusive HDD, where 20GB will cost you 100$.<br>  16).Sony expects PS3 to stay on the market for, at least, 7-10 years. Also Sony reduces price now. There is a cheaper 40GB version of PS3.<br>  17).Sony constantly upgrades PS3 software (free updates for OS) - you get new functions and improvements.<br>  18). PS3 controller (sixaxis) has a motion control - you move controller - game responds. Wii has it, Xbox 360 - doesn't. PS3 is getting rumble controller (Dualshock 3) on 15.04.2008, Japan already has it. On www.ebay.com I saw those controllers on sale 50$ and up (unofficial import).<br>  19).On PS3 you can help sick people by running Folding Home project. Wii and Xbox 360 didn't even think about it.<br>  20).New 40GB is 399$ or 399 euro (depends on the region) - it has no backwards compatibility with PS2 games, has 2 USBs instead of 4, no built-in card reader, but it's the same PS3, strong, reliable, less noisy, different cooling system. The price is friendly.<br>  21). But, to be just, I'm not a PS3 fanboy, so (despite I own one) hear this - PS3 games (exclusives) are very hard to develop due to complicated Cell's architecture. We have to wait till developers will figure out how to develop games properly. Sometimes multiplatform games run not so good on PS3 due to the same developing issues - it's hard for developers to get a grip on such advanced technologies|`|rkX1PtV7aa	welp the ps3 has blue ray and it's much cheaper than buying a blue ray player...the xbox 360 has a GREAT online play...but you gotta pay to play online...the xbox has a few more problems than the ps3..the xbox has halo...the ps3 has metal gear solid..and i love uncharted drakes fortune....the xbox dont have that. listen b4 you buy anything take a look at this site <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/justamessenger" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/justamessenger</a>|`|9kM9LJZWaa	PS3, to listen to any one who said for you to buy 360, i have the both of them but i've never played on the xbox such two times.|`|cUu1Z51Naa	Playstation 3 / besides of its future proof it will deliver you the best online capabilities like home or littlebigplanet|`|ZJFX6YFqaa	PS3. it's way more capable, and a blu-ray player.|`|BQQ36uYiaa	I would get an x-box 360. while its not much of a difference, you can tell that the graphics on the 360 are more detailed than the ps3. There are many good games that you can only get on the ps3, but there are also microsoft made games you cannot get on the ps3, and only the 360. Microsoft just seems like a more reliable company to buy from. The 360s have been reported to get the "red light," which is a red ring around the power button basically saying your system no longer works. It happened to my friend, but i have had my xbox since release and havent had any problems. Xbox live is enough of a reason for me to buy the 360 even if it was made of cardboard. its not expensive at all. $50 a year is very cheap. to put it on your monthly value, that would only be $4.17 a month. im done rambling on im gonna go see fire works. dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with ps3, im just giving you a one sided  story because i prefer the 360 :P|`|OqPaXomZaa	Ok, well PS3 does have some good exclusives that anyone would like. Metal Gear Solid 4, Resistance, Resistance 2 which is coming out, Killzone 2, Haze, and Warhawk. 360 has Halo 3 and Gears of War, and pretty much all its good games are just shooters. PS3 has more variety, and the onlie really is improving. PlayStation Network was recently updated to have like a trophy system that's better than the 360's achievements. And if course it's free. Plus they're going to keep updating PS3's online, making it better, all while being free. So I suggest the PS3, it's definately worth it

AA10303892	I don't think an antivirus for a mobile phone exists. You can try plugging in your mobile phone via USB to your PC and then scan the drive using your computer antivirus software.
Xo9cnuGwaa	Tough question, depends very much on the network, but also more importantly on what kind of calling card you use.  You can call directly but you'd be looking at rates from $.90 up to $2.45 (cingular/ATT).  If you use a mobile from the states and use a calling card your rates can drop to as low as $.20 a minute to asiacell/iraqna/omnean cell phones in Iraq (that's how much my wife pays to call me).  If your friend in Iraq can get a basic internet connection you can get Skype pro and he can call from his computer to your cell phone for very cheap, and the connection is usually descent during off-peak hours.

14sMa9sBaa	I'm assuming we are discussing the NTSC models. Other than the 20GB of more space the 80GB has, the 60GB has 99% backward compatibility with PS2 games, whereas the older 80GB has around 85-90%. The new 80GB has 0% compatibility with PS2 games like the 40GB model. However, all can play PS1 games. The new 80GB model has 2 USB ports, no flash card readers, and no SACD support. The 60GB and the old 80GB had 4 USB ports, had flash card readers, and they had SACD support. I think the 60GB model is the best one without a doubt. The cool thing about the PS3 is that you can upgrade it with any 2.5'' SATA internal hard drive, so you can always upgrade it if you need more room.|`|0fYHCHmFaa	80g allows you to download your game, so you will no longer need the disks to play.|`|C9uIF2KFaa	the amount of memory it has to store things on it.|`|6e2eebd498466699a4ceb47740f7b7cfaa	A bigger hard drive? |`|AplXCRkuaa	Depending on which 80gb it is, Motostorm/MSG4 bundles have 4 usb ports, memory card readers, and partial backwards compatibility. 80gb core has 2 usb ports, no memory card readers and no backwards compatibility. the 60gb has 4 usb ports, memory card readers and full backwards compatibility.|`|0jFgRYhQaa	The difference would be (of course) more memory on the 80g than the 60g.<br>  <br>  Another difference is that the 80g has a built in Blue Ray Disc player... some actually, not all... only the new 80g PS3s that came out... the old ones justhave more memory...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA10719916	20GB and remember larger hard drive doesn't make it any faster.|`|QotypMKoaa	Different Hard Drive Sizes|`|KKXwTC6waa	20g|`|oZikcfndaa	20g|`|pTgCvUcjaa	20g|`|OGVhwFa2aa	more storage space|`|ksSAPbMaaa	difference is  the 80G will perform the same with a large amount of memory and its more expensive . the 60G will perform the same and the hard drive is 20G smaller which  is a huge difference  60G is the one to go for . let me put it this way the windows vista computer only has 120G of storage and you will be lucky to fill 20 in your lifetime so either way you will never run out of room and for 100$ i would go for the 60G saving is allot don't get the 40G if you plan on playing playstation2 games it wont do it need special adaptions hope i helped!!

The touch is nicer, of course. It has more features.  But also it's more complicated, it's newer, so you run more of a risk of premature death. <br>  <br>  I had a 4th gen regular iPod, which was given to me by my sweetie, bought new (I would never have spent the money on myself). I used it every day for 4 years.  Then it died.  I took it back to The Apple Store and they said they don't fix an iPod that old, I should just buy another one.  This put me off iPods for good.  I would expect any device that cost $450 to last longer than 4 years, or at least be repairable.  It made me realize that ALL electronic devices, no matter how advanced and sophisticated and expensive, should be considered 'disposable'.<br>  <br>  Now I have a Sansa, which I absolutely love.  It cost $30 on EBay (refurb), so if it lasts a year and then dies I'll be happy, I'll just toss it and spend another $30.|`|0k9IJYS1aa	touch|`|IcHmWDSCaa	Prob. the touch cuz it has a lot of other things you can do on it as well, its lyk music plus games, and internet, and its touch screen :)|`|AA10263312	go for the touch.<br>  the games you  can buy on apps is relle funn lol|`|FcikBacZaa	An 3GB 3rd gen Nano<br>  <br>  It has a bigger screen than the 4th gen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or ipod touch (but it costs more)|`|iBPqutK5aa	iPod Touch I heard the games and apps were pretty awsome|`|KEK3HeRXaa	I would go with the 3rd or 4th generation.

Mr. T|`|AA12180617	utube uses FLASh for its video so you need to pay for a software licence to convert it to MPEG4 (otherwise you are limited to 30 seconds or have a logo superimposed over the video)..    the ipod ONLY play mpeg4 with h264 encoding, if you have the file in Quicktime or (only on systems with windows media components for Quicktime installed [ Microsoft website for this one]) WMV you can import it into itunes then form the itunes advanced menu use 'convert for ipod' and then the converted file will be mpeg4/h264.    getting this from a DVD or other format needs you to get a convertor or RIPPER and you can get these via www.versiontracker.com    although many shareware will either overall a trial logo or limit it to 30 seconds until you pay the unlocking fee.    for the Mac I use handbrake to RIP DVD's and it does correct to MPEG4.  the reason ipods only use mpeg4 is that its the only OPEN format that does not need an extra codec loading it into the operating system.    WMv, RAM, AVI, etc are not open formats they need codecs adding to the system to play and often these are locked to one program to play them.    ALSO You need to tell your ipod to sync apps, Music (or Movies etc) as by default most syncing is OFF other than Music which is ALL unless its too big for the ipod/iPhone when its none.    Plug ipod into itunes.  click on the ipods Icon its summary page appears.  click on the tab that says Video  click on 'Sync All' or ' Sync only selected'  click on APPPLY BOX  click on SYNC box.    voila it now will sync Video|`|nxtIhb4Oaa	iPod supports only mp4 and h.264 video, If you want to know how to convert video and put DVD movie on iPod, I think this step by step guide would help you  http://www.reviewstown.com/how-to-conver...

In fact, I have a cellphone, and I haven't used it to this date.  A very good reason to have one, is in a case of an emergency, or you need to get in contact with someone.  Say you need it to meet up with someone, or you're going to be late to work/school, or you were in an accident.  Or something else happened.    It's also a good way for people to get in contact with you easily if they're having trouble on THEIR end.    You can purchase some phones that have a plan that can give you so many dollars of minutes that will exsist for the whole year.  So that way, you don't have to worry about re-purchasing minutes every month, and also, you can have an emergency line.    It's a good idea. :]

HBNx77BBaa	It means 'general error'. Take out the battery for a few seconds. With luck you'll not see the message very often. I've seen it three times in three years on my 20D. If it doesn't clear or keeps coming back you'll need to discuss it with Canon.|`|JXc0O8G9aa	Lucky is correct.  This is Canon's "Catch All" error.  I had it happen on my 40D a while back.  Another thing to try is removing your lens and wiping your lens contacts on both the camera and the lens.    How many shots does your XT have?  I think the issue with my Canon was a faulty shutter.  XT's and other cameras in the Rebel series are only rated for 50k or so before their shutters start having issues.  Are you past this mark?
R4WX5twzaa	Hahahahhah, I can't even tell you how many times my boyfriend has lost his cell phone. Really the only thing you can do is keep looking, and if you still can't find it, tell him to go to the cell phone store, buy a new phone, and have them put that number on the new phone. He won't have his contacts, but that's what he gets for not being responsible with his phone!! =P|`|fwnqB0dTaa	There is no way to track a phone that is switched off, tracking relies on triangulating the signal a phone sends to towers to remain connected to the network.    And even if it was switched on, but maybe on silent so you couldn't ring it, the only way for a member of the public to track it would be if the owner had signed it up to a tracking service.    Other than that only law enforcement agencies can track phones, and even then only if a crime has been comitted, or they expect it is being used to plan a crime.|`|GhsqaXsdaa	Keep looking, idk if you can, but maybe call his phone provider and see if they can they can help?|`|kfqb635Eaa	Hmm.. i say check by the bed board    under the mattess or between in    i'm kind of physic     and i just guessed    but if that's not where it is, check his pockets  hahaha :P    uhmmmm...  look ur room head to toe.    boys often are lazy and just say they left it somewhere when they just can't really remember where they put it .    ahaha     happy findings. x|`|8VeQWevwaa	Since his cellphone is off there's really nothing that can be done.  See, if it was on you could call it but there's nothing you can do.  Keep searching! And good luck.|`|NMi1AZbqaa	Hmm.    I doubt it's at your house, he probably thinks he left it there but actually didn't.  I lost my cellphone in the same way, I thought it was on my bed and then I never saw it again.  It's not really your responsibility.  But I would suggest to keep looking for it and to retrace your steps.    Hope you find it!
OhTPygYlaa	No, sorry.<br>  Hope that helps.

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	you technically can, but you need a different ethernet cord, it ruins the laptop, its slow, and it takes a lot of configuration. If you need a wireless solution and want to avoid paying for the official microsoft adapter, try these:    http://www.amazon.com/wireless-gaming-ad...    http://gear.ign.com/articles/440/440246p...|`|4c7UlVpPaa	Yes..    If you you are using a wireless connection and you enable internet connection sharing on your laptop it will work. I use that same connection method on a computer I have attached to my tv.    Here are the instructions from microsoft.    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314066    You will also need a crossover cable that goes from the laptop to the xbox console. If it is an apple you can use any ethernet cable.     Mac settings are described below.     http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?...|`|evhwdzG3aa	yes i have done it you need to goto manage connection settings right click the wireless connection icon select properties and select top box allow others to connect...etc and ok    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=qU2TKABrd8...  same procedure with xp|`|QuktVKL2aa	no you cannot, you can only connect the wire from the router to the back of the 360

AA11101968	Many DVD player have a built-in upconverter, that is a much cheaper option.  Upconverting your VCR is a waste of time and money, and once all TV broadcasts are in HD, you'll really have no use for it.|`|kHwjvZKgaa	If you are getting an HD projector you should be getting a blu-ray player as well.     If you aren't getting a blu-ray player then I don't suggest a projector. If you have already bought a projector then just use the 360 for dvd's. As soon as you have the funds get a PS3 and then get netflix and start watching blu-rays. You will be amazed at the difference.
rDoS2jsNaa	I just upgraded my phone from a Chocolate to the Voyager and i wasnt eligible for an upgrade till July, but Verizon said i could do an early upgrade, but the rebate wouldn't be that much. So instead of me waiting to till July, i had to pay $80 instead of $30 in July. Oh it also depends on what kind of plan you have with them too. Because if you have cheap plan then, i dont know what to say. Anyway, I suggest to go to your account online and see what phones are you eligible to get right now by clicking on upgrade to a new phone link. And see how much it would cost. You probably wouldnt have to pay the retail price though. I would just call the Customer Service line or go the your account online.
jDADqTHhaa	yes, L72/L9 can receive mms, (i have a l72)  you need to check your gprs and mms settings  go to  "web access / web sessions " to view gprs profiles (contact provider for getting the correct mms profile)    go to "messages" , press "options", choose "setup> message setup" and choose "multimedia msg setup" to see mms settings  you can change mms profile in "server info".
MGyzOIKqaa	xbox is messed up, and you usually need to use one made by microsoft (owner of xbox)|`|jzh9PHm0aa	You can but you have to get a certain one.  It would have to be out of another xbox and be compatible with your xbox.

SKkE3fK1aa	you need to have an access point for sending multimedia messages.<br>  <br>  Access Points are 'codes' in your phone that will tell the phone that this activity needs this connection. Like...<br>  <br>  3G Internet<br>  GPRS Internet<br>  EDGE internet<br>  Multimedia Message<br>  Network Stream<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  You need to activate the multimedia message feature of your NETWORK (not your phone). Meaning you need to talk to AT&T and asking them to enable your MMS Access Point or any other access point. If you are on PAY AS YOU GO (or prepaid) then you should check the pack of your SIM card for the 'activation code'. Also, if you are on a contract, plan, postpaid, etc. then you really need to talk to AT&T to see whether MMS is OK for your plan.<br>  <br>  Also, ask about 3G internet (364 - 1.5 mpbs) if your phone is 3G-enabled. It'll give you a faster browsing on the go!
