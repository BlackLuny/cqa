20090304091809AA9ZLFv	Sports;Other - Sports	Fellow softball players......... Need some advice on the technique of hitting.?	Basically,   I need some advice on the best way/technique to create the most power   when hitting slow-pitch softball. Power in hitting a baseball comes from not only your bat speed and strength, but the speed of the pitch.   But it is drastically different hitting a slow softball.   Last year, my league used a harder softball core, and hitting it was no issue, and I used my upper body strength to hit bombs.   This year, the core is softer, and it's like hitting a wet sock. No bombs so far.   What are the dynamics to create the most efficient/powerful swing?   IE: bat speed, using your hips, upper body strength, how/where to stand in the batter's box, etc.......      Any advice on how to create a powerful swing would be much appreciated.      Later.......
20090304092054AAAnYVv	Sports;Hockey	Bobby Orr vs. Wayne Gretzky?	Why do so many people regard Gretzky as the greatest hockey player of all time?  Greatest offensive accomplishments?  Undoubtedly.  Greatest offensive talents?  Arguably.  However last I checked hockey games aren't won by scoring goals alone, they're won by scoring more goals than your opponent.  Orr was gifted in all phases of the game and his +124 season may stand longer than any of Gretzky's records.  Shouldn't the greatest hockey player ever be the most well-rounded hockey player ever?

And it hasn't been too solid so far.      He kept talking about being the World Heavyweight Champion going into Wrestlemania...then he talked about ending The Undertaker's Wrestlemania winning streak.      But now its apparent that neither of these things are going to happen.      Wrestlemania is in Houston this year...JBL is from Texas.      So I ask this...      Does anybody think JBL will have a role in this year's Wrestlemania...and if so what do you think that role will be?      Or...      Is JBL not going to appear at Wrestlemania 25.

20090304065553AAq0zp6	Sports;Football (Australian);Rugby League	Have You Ever Missed Watching That Player With The Something Special To Be Believed?	That's almost reality for me.   I remember watching Mat Rogers play for the Sharks in 2000 on the tv. After the Knights win of 1997 it is my first memory of rugby league. After going to Union then coming back to League I have been so excited to watch him play in the flesh. But in the 2 years he has been back I still haven't seen him. First year the Titans didn't visit Newcastle then last year I was annoyed that he managed to get himself suspended and didn't play when they did come. This year fingers crossed will be different.      Has there ever been a player, high or low profile, that you either can't wait to see play or have unfortunately missed?    I'm curious on the answers I get. Apart from some of the more obvious of the greats of the game i'm wondering about the ordinary players that just have something special that you wish you could see live.

20090304075214AAGPMmR	Sports;Football (American)	Hey OU fans everywhere?	Why are most of my OU bretheren so defensive about OU?  As Sooner fans, don't you think we deserve what we get from others, especially texass fans?  We haven't won a bowl game since Rhett Bomar was a freshman,  Sam Bradford was a senior in high school, and A.D. was still on the team.  We have lost 5 straight BCS games and 3 straight national championship games.  Don't give me the "at least we got there" crap.  I would rather go to the Alamo Bowl and win as go lose a BCS bowl and especially the national championship game.  There was NO WAY OU was going to beat florida and the media-appointed superman, tebow, because quite simply, we weren't good enough and our coaches weren't good enough.  OU deserves what they get from outsiders.  We have to produce when it counts and    we haven't in a long, long time.  Winning a Big XII chamionship doesn't mean a whole lot if you follow it up by losing to someone like Boise St. or getting blown out by a team who's coach didn't even think enough of his alma-mater to wait til after the bowl game was over to leave.  We played about as good as we possibly could against florida, and there was no disgrace there considering I thought we'd get blown out, but what about all these other bowl games?  We sucked, and are getting what we deserve from these outsiders and haters.

I have wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle almost all my life but my parents always talked about how dangerous it was/is. Obviously, I never learned.      A year ago I started dating a guy who has been riding motorcycle/dirtbike for 11 years. His whole family also rides motorcycles...yes, even his mom. Before his mom sold her old bike my boyfriend took me out to try and teach me how to ride but I had so much fear in me because of my parents. I fell off twice because I was nervous about the gas and the brakes...I stalled it.      What can I do? I'm going to take a course this summer but my fear of getting hurt/crashing scares me so much. So I have some questions I would like to ask anyone out there (WOMEN TOO) about learning how to ride.      How long does the fear last?   How long does it take to get comfortable riding?   What is the best bike I could get for someone my size (5'5)?   Is it hard to learn?   and   Anything I should know about/safety tips?      Thank you. I'm asking here instead of asking my boyfriend because I feel he's less likely to understand how scared I am. He'll just say, "you can do it, there is nothing to be afraid of" and that's not what I want to know.      :)

20090304084859AARfQkD	Sports;Auto Racing;Other - Auto Racing	What do you think this as a reality show for auto enthusiasts?	Basically, a show about a contestant given a budget, to purchase and build up a car to beat a ride that Jay Leno picks out within the same budget. The contestant is given 3 tries racing on a track with Jay Leno, if he beats Jay at least once he gets to keep the car and a prize money on top of that. The story would basically follows the contestant shopping and comparing the cars, and of course the drama of modding, track testing, and in the end the final moments of the races.   For the opening scene, Jay Leno walks down his warehouse garage, and picks out the BMW M3 (stock only), and then the contestant would be given 60K budget and x number of days to race Jay on a particular track. Maybe add a rule that whatever the contestant builds has to stay street legal.      What do you think? I don't work for TV or anything but just having fun jogging this idea around in my mind.

20090304084106AAUvrXE	Sports;Martial Arts	What should I commit to?	Last night I watched the movie taken. Now, I know that it's just a movie, and you can't really do all that stuff, but it made me think. If me and my family were to be attacked, or something terrible like that, I would not be able to defend them, nor myself. I'm 21, 6ft tall, 220 lbs, and I don't know anything about fighting, or martial arts. I want to learn an art that is super tough, no ***** footing around, bone breaking mega. Some that I have looked into are Krav Maga, Shogun Karate, Judo, and jiu jitsu. When I commit to something, I really commit, so what should I take up? I want something that if you throw a punch at me you'll wind up on your back, unconscious, with a busted arm. Something that can engage a man with a knife, gun, or weapon, or several men at a time. Please give me some advice.

What exactly does this mean? My understanding of this is that we can keep 5 fish in the livewell and swap them out for larger bass if caught, unless a bass dies, in which case we must keep the dead fish.      Do I understand the rule correctly, or am I missing something? Any info would help. Thankyou.

Well unlike in TNA, the Divas aren't the highest rated segment on their weekly shows. The heavyweight divisions are what people tune in to WWE for, not the Divas. People talk up the Knockouts so much because they don't have anything good to say about TNA's main events.

Mark Henry: Henry will probably play the same role as bobby lashley when he was in MITB, he'll throw everyone around, he might  world strongest slam someone onto a ladder, and he'll try to climb the ladder maybe twice only to get pushed off.      What do u think of their roles?      Who do u think will fill the last two spots??   I think Rey Mysterio and Evan Bourne will

So im putting the ball in play but i feel something is missing. Maybe its because im still not use to the wood bats?

I currently train in Kempo Jiu Jitsu, ranked as a brown belt but what I've learned is more standing self defense (but some ground as well). I've been training for 2.5 years. I know the ranking for BJJ is very different from Kempo. I've rolled with 4 tip white belts and blue belts in BJJ that have given me a challenge on the ground so the rankings are obviously not apples to oranges.      I just started cross training 2 months ago at a BJJ place and my official BJJ rank is white belt but I'm wondering with my Kempo experience if it is considered "sandbagging" if I enter in the white belt division?

20090304104807AAOB4kB	Sports;Football (American)	What really happened with Nick Schuyler and his friends?	I just read on the Washington Post, that Nick Schuyler is saying that one of the NFL players took off their life jackets and gave up.. drifting off to sea to die.  A few hours later, the second NFL player did the same.  Then a while later, Will took off his life jacket because he saw a light and wanted to swim towards it.      Here's my line of thinking.  Why didn't he try to hold them back? He's a personal trainer, Nick Schuyler.  He would have been able to motivate them to live. He motivated them to stay and train more many times, why couldn't he do that in a life or death situation?  I don't think you'd just give up.. I'd think you'd float there till you died, because of your will to survive.  Also, these guys don't sound like quitters.. they were all hard workers.      Secondly, there was only one thing to hold onto, and that was on the bottom (but the top since it was flipped) of the boat.  That was the motor itself.  Honestly, it's very possible that because his stories sound ridiculous, that since that was the only spot to hold onto that wasn't IN the water (ie: it was a dry spot), they fought over it.  Maybe he was really the only one who was able to get a life jacket, and his story could be proven when they find the life jackets without bodies because instead of "taking them off" they were there the whole time under the boat.  After drowning them he let the life jackets go into the sea.      Who else thinks this could be fight for survival?  I don't think it was planned.. they were friends.  But, when it comes to life and death situations, and there's only one thing to hold onto that's not in the water so you don't get hypothermia as quickly, people might fight for that with their life.       What do you people think? I mean no disrespect, but my intuition is very good, and I've had a pit in my stomach about his stories since Monday when he told them, and something isn't right...

I used to love hearing Henry Blofeld get overly excited about seagulls but the funniest one was with the unfortunate run-out of Shane Thompson (New Zealand Cricketer in the early 90s).  Thompson played a forward defensive shot and without him knowing his back foot dragged out of the crease, the ball dribbled to silly point who picked it up, looked at Shane's foot and calmly threw down the stumps.  When they were showing the slow motion replay the commentator (I forget who) who was also a New Zealander was commentating as if he was talking to Shane and could influence the events that had also happened.      replay shows the foot dragging out   commentator: Look where you foot is Shane!!      replay shows ball going towards fielder and Shane holds his pose   commentator: Get your foot back Shane!!, its out of the crease Shane!!, Get your foot back!!      replay shows the fielder picking up the ball and looking at the batsmen   commentator: Stop admiring your shot and get your foot back into the crease you idiot!!!!      replay shows ball hitting the stumps and batsman still out of the crease   Commentator: Hes out, you're out Shane, he's out, you deserve to be out Shane, that was the stupidest thing I've seen!!      any fond memories you have of commentators or commentary, post them and the best will get 10 points.  I bet the Aussies have plenty from the great Richie Benaud.
