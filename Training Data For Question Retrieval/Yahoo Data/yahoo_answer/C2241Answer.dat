AA10271718	Once you have downloaded the appropriate server program you can follow these steps to get a default server up and running ASAP.<br>  <br>  Windows platform:<br>  <br>      1) Download and execute the latest Ventrilo Windows Server. This will create an entry in your Start menu called "VentSrv".<br>  <br>      2) From the "VentSrv" menu click the "Ventrilo Server" menu option. This will open a console window application that the server will run in.<br>  <br>  This will start the server using default settings which should be more then sufficient for the normal user.<br>  <br>  The ventrilo server does not have a GUI interface. All output will occur in the console window.<br>  <br>  To change the configuration of the server simply click Start -> VentSrv -> Edit INI file. This will open the server INI configuration file using the Notepad program. Make the necessary changes, save the file and restart the server. The INI file is documented in the "Setup Documentation" menu option.<br>  <br>  The server can be started in the background on the NT / 2000 / XP platforms via a service program. First make sure you have the server configured properly and in a usable state as shown above because once you start it as a service you will not see any visual feedback. You need only click on the VentSrv -> Service -> Install menu option once after installing the program. The next time you reboot your computer the server will be automatically started in the background as a Service application.<br>  <br>  You can also purchase a vent server, and it will be online within minutes of your purchase. <a href="http://www.gameservers.com/ventrilo_servers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gameservers.com/ventrilo_serv...</a>

I have used quilting type cotton, linen, upholstery, bottom weight and twill.<br>  <br>  When a pattern is specifically for quilted material, but you do not want it quilted, you will need to use fusible batting on the back of the fabric for stability along with a backing to serve as the lining.<br>  <br>  The straps and pockets will help hold the layers together.
hwu4ZFLbaa	7/10 as well; being that you are not worried about advanced format there is a lot you can add.<br>  <br>  one is the addition of first strike cards (monsters with 4 stars or less but at least 1600 or more attack)<br>  <br>  Try Alien Shocktrooper, or Gagagigo (i don't know if the second one is spelled right so you will have to see. These cards mean that you can instantly take on your opponent and do some damage<br>  <br>  Staying on that note you should triple up on venom monsters (venom boa, venom serpent, venom snake and i think it's venom cobra) <br>  <br>  In the end your deck should look like this; (i'm not saying how many copies that is up to you)<br>  <br>  Evil Dragon Ananta <br>  Gagagigo <br>  Alien Shocktrooper <br>  Venom Boa <br>  Venom Serpent <br>  Venom Snake<br>  (whatever alien cards you plan to feature)<br>  Sangan<br>  Witch of the Black Forest<br>  Cobraman Sasuky (he will come in handy)<br>  Razor Lizard (another handy one)<br>  Balloon Lizard (for damage)<br>  <br>  You can add whatever drawing cards are necesary (skelengel, tongue twister, dark mimic etc.)<br>  <br>  Then you can choose some support magic cards Keep what you have add some venom cards and alien cards maybe throw in a copy of the card axe of despair and batista of the rampart smashing also optionally you can place a forest card in there<br>  <br>  Finally, for traps your pretty good you might want to throw in a few copies of Jar of Greed and Reckless Greed and definitely add either a magic cylinder, ring of destruction, or mirror force to force your opponent off guard<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, your deck right now can do some damage and hopefully with these upgrades will be very destructive|`|TOilCuG3aa	looks alright<br>  <br>  7/10

5EYxcEu6aa	you have to buy the World of Warcraft. Then World of Warcraft : The Burning Crusade. Then Wrath of the Lich KIng.  The only reason you would need WotLK is if you have a level 68-70 character and want to level to 80.  The Burning Crusade is only needed if you want to start out with a Blood Elf (horde) or Draeni (alliance) character, and/or you are a level 58-60 and want to level to 70. But if you are just starting out and you know what race you are going to be and it's not blood elf or draeni, you can just buy the first one.  I would probably get the WoW and WoW : BC combo pack though. It's cheaper

An Xbox version was planned but has since been cancelled for undisclosed reasons. The game takes place in a fictional boarding school called Bullworth Academy. The motto of the school, Canis Canem Edit, is Latin for dog eat dog. The game is also available as a special edition that includes a limited edition comic book, and a dodgeball of the same style as the ones used in the game, with the word "Bully" engraved on it.

40a198d77c9ee7b0e62a63be20b8743faa	Most of the time it's just a way to spam you. The only reason some of those things work is because they make money through getting you to click on ads and by refferring you to join programs. When they ask you to get 10 other friends or so to sign up, the "company" makes money and they possibly sell your email address for more money. Every once in a while, when they accumulate lots of money, they will send you what they promised but if they do not reach their expectations from advertisement cash out of you then they will not send you the promised deal. So be wary when dealing with them, most of the advertisements are a scam.|`|17b959544fe5d0f04baabb39f366b6f5aa	Nope sorry.

AA12144055	Final Fantasy I and II were rereleased in gameboy color format in the US.  Final Fantasy III was released seperatly but also on gameboy color.  With Final Fantasy 5,6,7 they were released on the Psone and I'm not sure that emulators for the PS are available.  Dragon Quest V was rereleased on the PS2 as well as Dragon Quest VIII was released on Ps2.  Theres nothing strong enough through emulators to equal the Ps2 in power.  It's also illegal.
SMpGcalaaa	I own every sstreet fighter fighter game and  in my opinion street fighter 4 is the best street fighter game.My pick for second best street fighter game would be marvel vs capcom 2(if you consider this a street fighter game).Street fighter 3 3rd strike  would be my 3rd pick|`|wg4XdI5taa	I don't own the game but i have played it at a friends house. The very good thing about the game is they kept it simple keeping the 2d fighting. I personally hate the 3D games like mortal combat now days. And it's good to keep the original 2d around. Moves are very simple to do also and not as complicated as mortal combat. Really the only difference is the graphics added moves and new characters while keeping all the original characters. Personally if you are a huge fan of the old school street fighter games you won't be disappointed.|`|bRJRKBn1aa	yes it is. go to gamespot and check the score and its a 9.0?10. so that explains if its good or not.|`|ahSDb7Tzaa	yes, yes and YES! its awesome.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	lol me and my bf were just talking about this... the new graphics are sick! we were playing the old one the other day... and it took us like 10 min to beat it....lol..|`|bQisGgSsaa	No, I like The first one better.

dYeV7SWzaa	I think it's very difficult to find shiny pokemon, because this pokemon will stronger than normal pokemon caused by mutation (remember Red Gyarados in Pokemon Silver-Golden-Crystal Version). Since Dialga is LEGENDARY POKEMON, although it's not shiny pokemon, he is stronger than other pokemon. I never found Legendary shiny pokemon and I think it's impossible to find it because I have been played all pokemon versions (fake version not included) and I never meet Legendary shiny pokemon. For ordinary pokemon, maybe (if you lucky) you can find shiny pokemon but it's very rare. For addition, shiny pokemon may infected by poke virus (pokerus) and it can infect another pokemon! (but many people said pokerus make pokemon stronger and get more experience than normal) Pokerus can't be cured and it will disappeared it self and your pokemon can't infected twice.

d0f5RJ8Jaa	here are a few ideas that you can modify or build on, as per your requirements...i'll try to keep them simple & low-cost.<br>  <br>  - make mosaic pictures. cut colored paper [from old magazines] into "tiles" of whatever shape you wish. draw a picture outline - urban landscape or geometrical pattern .... glue the "tiles" in coordinated colors.<br>  - look for any differently shaped or beautiful bottles & jars in your kitchen/cosmetics/toiletries, etc. Use these as vases. embellish with whatever you like, in colors that suit the decor. you could use glass paints too - you get them in any craft store [ they will keep the transparency intact].<br>  - you could even use glass or ceramic mugs, bowls, glasses for your flower arrangements. or just place them as a set in some corner.<br>  - make or buy artificial flowers - they are so much cheaper than fresh flowers in the long run. <br>  - if a bouquet of fresh flowers becomes a couple of days old, hang it upside down on a string for a few days till all the flowers & twigs have dried completely. this technique ensures that the color of petals & leaves remains as true as possible [it is always better to use fresh flowers tho']. use these to make an arrangement. some flowers as especially suited for this & can last a lifetime.<br>  - you could try your hand at "mock" sculptures -- think of what you want. use rolled or scrunched up newspapers, etc. to make the 3D model. then convert it to papier mache - layer the entire model with 3 layers of newspaper or kitchen roll or tissue strips using PVA glue diluted in water. allow it to dry for a few days. then paint with acrylic colors. note: newspaper strips give it a smooth finish while tissue/k-roll strips give a textured finish. choose accordingly.<br>  <br>  you can browse the net for specific ideas - just type in the key words in search engines for a whole list of instructional sites as well as videos...<br>  <br>  hope these inspire & get you started.<br>  all the very best & have fun :-))

ecf20dc26bb6402c0a5bca02c1ec05e7aa	Every person who I've ever met who grew up sewing on an old Singer is in sewing machine heaven the moment they realize that an old Singer is probably better than any machine they could find on the market today. If you want all the stitches, I'd suggest a Singer 401 or 500. Those are both strong machines, slant shank machines (that refers to the presser foot), and have an amazing variety of stitches. Next I'd recommend an Elna Super. It will cost a little less than a Singer 401 or 500, but will have a good compliment of stitches, plus you can augment them with Elna cams. Many of the stitches we use today were first pioneered by Elna back in the day.<br>  <br>  Also, a good quality vintage machine such as the abovementioned has style, pizazz, and durability. You'll never have the top of the line machine snob in the quilt class look down her nose at you if you waltz in with a Rocketeer! <br>  <br>  I've included a link from a contemporary sewist who uses a 401. It's got lots of pictures, so you can get an idea.|`|TqMqd3hXaa	I just bought a Kenmore.  Several of the Kenmore machines are manufactured by Janome, a Swiss company.

ZwmVrFeWaa	Maybe you should just stop playing games if they are too difficult for you to play without cheating or abusing bugs.<br>  <br>  Also, glitches are not "put" in a game. They are merely bugs that can or cannot be fixed by the creators of a game.|`|6GIrW5eWaa	bug is such a harsh word. I care to think of them as undocumented features. <br>  <br>  By the way the other answers are correct. They don't put them there they are a by product of poor testing, poor programing and accidents. The patches are fixes for them. Maybe if people didn't post glitches on youtube they would not patch them so quickly but eventually everyone knows them.|`|bS5wpKvOaa	You think they actually put the glitch in the game?<br>  <br>  No.  A glitch is something that happens when the game wasn't thoroughly looked through, or not completely finished.  Its an accident.<br>  <br>  They fix them with patches, because glitches are not good things.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oooh sharks.  It must be on purpose.  Or maybe they planning something else, and cut it, then put new data on top of it.  Because those plans never went out.|`|MbDb94N2aa	It doesn't matter whether you would or wouldn't call them accidents or not..that's exactly what they are. Just a mistake in the programming...and looked over by very poor Beta testers. (I personally think every Beta tester for call of duty W@W should be shot) The develepors find the glitches and try to patch them in order to remove them...which sometimes can create new glitches based on the regular programming code and the patch code having a small conflict. Sharks or no sharks, the glitches aren't planned and aren't just PUT there.|`|oTtZekp3aa	No game developers "put" the glitches in a game. Glitches are accidents, where the game doesn't know what to do, so it does a default thing, or will just remove a temporary texture. <br>  <br>  What game developers do put in the game are easter eggs. Things that give you a slight advantage, but not that much. Things that don't really affect certain gameplay.

lOMGiGkAaa	it depends what you like and your aim in the game. if you like rushing in - assault. if you like long range sniping - recon. I find its a brilliant game online, and i started off as a support and got all of the unlocks. They are good for medium to long range shooting as they have more ammo than regular weapons, plus they have some cool unlocks like your own little radar you can put down, a sentry gun etc. however if you get into close range with an assault player the guns tend to be too slow at firing for you to be a deadly force. A shotgun is an available unlock but not always practical. I wouldnt suggest recon, unless you like long range shooting, although you wont neccessarily get loads of kills but they can get camouflage capabilities and demo packs. Assault seems to be the most versatile with good guns for killing at pretty much every range, especially the unlockable guns, plus they can heal others, get smoke grenades, radar grenades..... although saying that all teams need a good engineer to take out vehicles or a recon with demo pack (if you come up against a walker and your only an assault unit all you can do is run!). Squad leader isnt a class, just means you lead a squad, you can get unlocks for this such as a beacon to spawn on (lay it almost anywhere open - not inside - it becomes a spawn point) but i wouldn't suggest becoming a squad leader until you have had some practice. hope this helps|`|KW74WtMpaa	as the guy befor said it just depends on your style.  with battlefield 2142 you are given alot of freedom as to how you take on an objective or and opponent.  Probably the best class is the Support Class.  To me it has the most diversity, at a cost though of the ability of your primary weapon.  Each gun has its own range, stregnth, rate of fire, and accuracy as all guns in the game do.  However they seem to have more extremes in difference.  With the support class while notable differences are they between the 3 assualy rifles they still almost seem to mesh together.  Were as Support fire arms are drastically different.  One is good for long range with a slower rate of fire which takes long for the gun to overheat and as you shoot the aiming device decreases in size for better accuracy aswell higher damage, this gun is called the Ganz.  The standard guns (the Bianchi and the Shuko) have a weaker bullets and the aiming device takes longer to shrink however the rate of fire is very fast to compensate for its other lackings.  This gun is best for close to medium legnth encounters.  The last of the primary fire arms is a not a automatic weapon but rather a shotgun, and we all know the characteristics of a shotgun it is devastating at close range.  Aside for the primary weapons there is gear.  You have at your dipposal (after being unlocked) is an emp grenade which will short out electrical devices such as IPS shields , active camoflauge, sentry turrets, and also stall enemy vehicles.  You also can use the sentry gun stated above,  which is great for covering you back while defending an area or holding down a critical area giving you extra fire power.  There is a device as well the name fails me but it will reveal enemy troops to you by means of marking them with red rhombuses, this information will be transmitted to you teammates as well if you are in a squad.  There also the IPS shield which provides some cover from small arms fire.  Using it properly you can set up and ambush enemies with relativly good cover or place it at the top of a ladder and prevent someone sneaking up on you. A equipment choice which you dont unlock but is standard to the support class is the ammo hub.  This will resupply you and your side of the team as well vehicles used by your side.  Resupplying a teammate will give you a point futhering you toward your next unlock.  Now with all that side with the combinations of weapons and gear for the support class the possibilities are endless in many situations.  For example, lets say your defending an outpost and you have the shuko, IPS shield  and the sentry gun.  You can place the sentry near you flag so when on coming troops try to capture the base it opens fire on them, it will make a distinct noise when activated.  While they screw around trying to take out the turret get in range and unload on them.  Suppose someone helping you defend is a sniper on a high roof somewhere, to assist them drop the ISP shield somewhere useful to them and they have extra cover while defending while your at it drop an ammo hub near them and help stregnthen them that much more.  Another example is your taking over a base with some other teammates and you have a shotgun location device and emp grenades.  Get within range of the base and use the tracking device to find out where enemies are at the base so you dont fall victim to a sniper posted on a tower.  You have the shotgun so you can go around tight obstacles asuring you will be in close combat  and are given the distinct advantage to someone with a assault rifle.  If you encounter an enemy vehicle in the area hit it with the emp, hopefully youll have a engineer with you who can take it out while you stall it.  The support class can be used this way helping out your teammate or you can go lone wolf and dominate with the choices you have with this class.  Ultimatly the game is more less team based,  bonus even show the benefits of working together.  So in my opinion....support.  This was a long answer i know and yes Im a giant nerd... buy this game.

c8205cf445cc71f364e54682ed32b76aaa	This could be considered a spoiler, but i'll try to explain what i can<br>  <br>  Namine is Kairi's nobody.  A nobody comes from a person who turns into a heartless.  The heartless is formed from the darkness in the persons heart, but since Kairi was one of the "princesses" from Kindom Hearts 1, she didn't have any darkness in her heart, that's why her body stayed, and didn't turn into a heartless.  <br>  <br>  Now i think how it goes is when a nobody, their corresponding heartless, and their heart come together (somehow, the persons heart and the heartless are together, so i don't know why they are called heartless), they can be what they were before (not sure, i'm guessing.  Might be in one of the Ansem reports in KH2).  <br>  <br>  Since Sora freed Kairi's heart by unlocking his own (the part in KH1 where Sora becomes a heartless), she didn't need Namine to join her to come back, so she was kind of split.<br>  <br>  So Namine is Kairi's "other half", and Roxas is Sora's "other half"<br>  <br>  Finish the game, though, it's worth it.  One of the best RPG's i've played in a loooong time, can't wait for KH3 to finally come out :)|`|AA12261038	in KHI in the secret spot, when Kairi runs into Sora, thats when her heart was transfered to his. thusly no heartless, along with the fact that he is a PoH, and no darkness.<br>  you see<br>  person<br>  heart<br>  darkness of the heart<br>  soul<br>  heart leavs, joins KH (the heart of all worlds)<br>  the darkness, having no heart (heartless) remains, looking for hearts. the body is reborn into light, but can still use darkness. thus far, no one knows what happens to the soul. kairi, having no darkness of the heart, being a princess of heart, has no heartless. Xemnas didnt talk to his heartless or anything like that cuz everyone else who bacame a heartless was defeated. roxas wasnt killed, and Sora rejoined with him during their fight in TWtNW, and Kairi and Namine rejoined in the castle dungeon

SV0lQdl0aa	First, don't make it too big because it will be too hard to manage, small and cramped is good! Don't hire too many employees because you will run out of jobs for them to do and you will just be wasting your money.  Use cheat codes (motherlode moveobjects on etc.)!!!!  Without them, it will be VERY difficult to successfully start your buisness.  If you are making a toy store, flower store, electronic store, etc. don't open your store until you have put all your products out and have all of your employees or else people will come and you won't be ready and one of those sims could possibly be someone ready to write a report about you in the newspaper and that's the LAST thing you want!  Try to hire people with badges and really try to earn some badges yourself because then you will be able to tidy up or build some toys, electronics, etc. in your spare time!  Also, don't be afraid to fire employees!  If an employees is not doing their assigned job, give them 1 more chance, and if they don't do their assigned job AGAIN, fire them!  All they are doing is wasting your money, even if they have tons of badges!  Most importanty, MAKE SURE YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE HAPPY!!  Don't price too high or too low (you will never get any money!)!  Start out cheap, then moderate, and once you've gotten that great review in the paper, you could consider having expensive prices.  Sell objects you can buy from your buy menu!  Sims will definately buy them!!  <br>  <br>  Have fun playing!! Sims 2 Open for Buisness is one of the best expansion packs in my opinion!  Hope this helps!!|`|AA10107480	Two things that I have found the most helpful and simplest are:<br>  <br>  1. When you are in a store/resturant don't try to sell them the items right away just keep "showing" the items to your customers...I gained a lot of stars this way.<br>  <br>  2. Use the cheat code maxmotives...everyone including all of your employees will max out their energy, bladder, etc. you can keep them happy and working for as long as you want!!!<br>  <br>  (in case you don't know how to use cheats or just want more cheats: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/thesims2/hints.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/thes...</a> or <a href="http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/thesims2/cheatscodes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/thesi...</a> )

SV0lQdl0aa	I don't think you can download a whole neighborhood, but you can dowload a lot of house to make a neighborhood and you can also download sims, furniture, etc.  You can download these at: <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/exchange/index.php?pid=Exchange" rel="nofollow">http://thesims2.ea.com/exchange/index.ph...</a><br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA10107480	You have to download lots individually at least on the Sims 2 official site. But if you want to download a series of similar houses, etc. try using search terms like "Victorian" or "Small Town" depending on the type you want or if you like a paticular users uploads check out their sim page as they generally create similarly themed homes and businesses.<br>  <br>  You also get new neighborhoods with many of the expansion packs. Nightlife = Downtown, Seasons = Riverblossom Hills, etc.
AA10107480	If you haven't invested too much time into your houses/families try uninstalling all the games and then reinstalling them.

AA10312525	Yes, it is called "a ti te toca".  I find that it helps with conjugation of any verbs and works very well.  All you need is an egg timer, some index cards, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another one is called "sacce tu propio juego" and involves asking for the instructions as well as a responsive to an open, leading question such as the one you pose.
l8drSnxzaa	sorry but i have to tell you i have the english version and its much better than the japanese one it dosen't work i tried all the ways with ditto. But i did it with a thing that is almost like game shark i put a code then i get 99 masterballs every time i do it its good try to buy it, it can also give you shining pokemons and legendaries that are lv. 100 right after you put the code good luck!
UVqaDAZmaa	Safe puzzle <br>  Once the safe has been opened, inside is a small drawer with slots with the letters A, E (3), H, L, R, S, T, U, V, and W. Look for the poster above the radio just outside the safe. You will find the answer there in a song that Patrick sings. The answer to open this second hidden door is: Rule the Waves.<br>  <br>  Miss Brent alive and dead at the same time <br>  The game may glitch to where Miss Brent is knitting downstairs on the patio alive, but is also dead in bed at the exact same time. This happens because she must first complete the part of your escape plan that you have given her, which is to sew the two sheets together. For her to finish this you must give her sheets (found in the upstairs closet), sewing needles (found in the Rogers' room), and fishing line (found behind the thorn bushes). To get past these thorns, find the fermented apples near the bee hives. Using the cheese cloth, place them in the juicer in the kitchen. You will need a piece of the submarine hidden through the "Rule the Waves" door before you can do this. Make sure to explore the rooms beyond the safe very carefully or you will miss the sub. Once you have the apple cider, take it to the thorn bush and use it there. Grab the fishing line and give it to Miss Brent. Walk away for a few minutes and return. The sheets are done and you can combine the four things you need: the tri-pod for the telescope, the sheets, the leather goat harness and the fishing net to get your parachute.|`|AA12381186	<a href="http://www.cheatcodes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheatcodes.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cheatcc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheatcc.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gamewinners.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamewinners.com</a>

l8drSnxzaa	It's possible but tricky.<br>  <br>  First you get the pokemon you want and go to the GTS. Submit that Pokemon, like you want to trade it. It'd be best to say you want something no one would trade for it, so someone doesn't actually trade for it.<br>  <br>  Next, when you hit accept and it says it's checking the GTS status or whatever, in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, you see a little clock. This is the main part of the cloning. Make sure you're in an area where your connection only has one little bar. After the clock goes around 8 times, turn off your DS. Now, when you turn the game back on and try to load your file, you'll get a message saying data is corrupted, but DO NOT WORRY! This doesn't delete your data. Nintendo is smart and made it so everytime you save, it saves in two slots. So it'll just load that backup slot and nothing will go wrong. Now, if you did it perfectly, that Pokemon you put on the GTS will be both in your party and up in the GTS for you to take out. So voila, you have two identical Pokemon.<br>  <br>  Just remember, this is REALLY tricky and don't get frustrated if you can't make it work everytime. I've only done it once|`|ta0FVCHTaa	ras you suck man syke if you wanna clone get your pokemon and stick it up your asss.<br>  <br>  from your classmate mohamed|`|qya3gFKcaa	I'm not exactly sure if you can.

eFW5O92Yaa	Well it depends on your preference between AEG and snipers. I own a UTG L96 and it is an awesome gun with great quality. The only other sniper I would even think twice about getting is the JG Bar10 if I was going to upgrade. The broxa evolution has good statistics but I really couldn't tell you about durability and quality. If you did get the broxa I'd suggest .2g if you don't mind spending a little bit more, for the accuracy. As for the L96, use .25 or bigger if you can find some.

43zXRpLYaa	I tried to get rehired. I went down there and filled out their paperwork, they said it would go to the their appeals board. I didn't get an answer from them for four months and all it said was I could not be rehired even though I had a great record working there. I resigned after they cut my hours down to five hours a week. I kept the job for 3 months giving my hours to other cast members who could 5 extra hours because I found a full time job elsewhere making $4 an hour more. They wouldn't give me enough hours to pay my bills, but they demanded I work some crappy hours on Thanksgiving day so I resigned.<br>  <br>  When they hired me I was a seasonal cast member, but they made me a cast regular after my training because I did so well. The only thing I can think of was they got mad because they didn't pay me correctly and I called them on it. They were forced to pay me the correct amount. Who knows why they won't rehire me because they won't give me a reason.<br>  <br>  My guess is since they just laid-off a bunch of people that they wouldn't rehire anyway.

D8BDhIGwaa	You can connect your Xbox 360 to your router/modem with a ethernet cable.  You don't have to connect wirelessly, you can connect wired!<br>  <br>  This is assuming your computer is connected to the internet through a wireless router/modem (which has a spare RJ45 ethernet socket) and it controls the login to your internet connection to your internet service provider (ISP).  That is, the router/modem has the username and password to your ISP and that this info is not supplied by your computer each time it wants to connect to the internet.

CZ3q8xioaa	Some areas like Saints Row and the airport are completely different. Places have been added like the prison, University, suburbs expansion, Marina, and the nuke plant. And most of the other areas have changed slightly.
1W3S3RlIaa	The map is about 1.5x the size of the original with the addition of some new districts. The looks of the areas depends on what the Ultor Corp. has done, some areas look exactly the same (Barrio, Factories), some are slightly different (Suburbs, High End Retail), and some look completely revamped (Airport, Downtown). Just driving around the city, you'll feel like you're in a familiar place most of the time, but a lot has changed and the world is much more bright and immersive in the northern part of the city. The game's graphics are much more advanced from the original as well as much less bugs (no more falling under the city), and the storyline's "sequel" is much better than I expected. |`|WxO7twfhaa	No, i believe it is some what different from the first game.

AA11590332	I think I've heard of this. it's a condition that's more wide-spread than just FPS games.<br>  <br>  something like... virtual motion sickness. or virtual dimensia.<br>  you weren't specific to which game, so I can't be sure if it's caused by the motions of the game.<br>  <br>  it could also be the sound is disturbing your inner ear balance.<br>  <br>  extended lengths of play could contribute to low blood sugar, vitamin D defficiancy, dehydration, eye strain, carpultunnel, and other such things related to game play and extended computer usage.<br>  <br>  what I suggest is taking the reccomended 15 minute breaks every 1-2 hours, looking away from the monitor during loading  screens, keeping a water bottle or some such thing nearby, making sure you don't go hungry by having healthy snacks handy and eating them rationally, making sure that blood circulation does not cease throughout any part of your body by stretching a little about every hour and a half.<br>  <br>  if those don't help, it could also be the brightness of your monitor. perhaps lowering them to a more comfortable setting would assist you.<br>  <br>   A good deal of monitors give off radiation, which is why shields/guards are available for purchase. some people are quite sensitive.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps a little bit.<br>  <br>  I just remembered something I read in a local news paper. <br>  <br>  playing action packed video games like a FPS can increase certain chemicals in the body. such as dopamine and adrenaline, both of which are highly addictive. if it's not any of the previously mentioned things, then you could be getting a stimulouse high off the game, and then nothing exciting enough happens when it starts to ware off, so you go through withdrawl symptoms.<br>  all I can say about that, is eat your green veggies :-D|`|AA10074753	"Motion sickness results when the brain receives wrong information about the environment,"<br>  To help keep our bodies in balance, our sensory systems continually collect information about our surroundings and send it to our inner ears, and like computers, they organize the information and send it on to the brain.<br>  <br>  It is when our balance system notes a discrepancy between what our inner ears sense and our eyes sense that motion sickness can take hold,<br>  Symptons include Dizziness, sweating, turning pale, nauseated, and worse of all vomiting. Once it comes on it can be difficult to stop, try these to help prevent the symptoms.<br>  <br>  After about 5-10 min stop looking at the T.V. and find a stationary object to focus on.<br>  <br>  Take a preventive pill. It'll help get your sensory system back in balance. <br>  <br>  Gingerroot. The first settlers to the New World might have taken it to ease their transatlantic voyage. Although the tradition dates back hundreds of years, eating a bit of ginger recently passed scientific scrutiny when an experiment showed that two powdered gingerroot capsules were more effective than a dose of Dramamine in preventing motion sickness. Ginger works, researchers theorize, by absorbing acids and blocking nausea in your gastointestinal tract.<br>  <br>  Olives and lemons. The early stages of motion sickness cause you to produce excess saliva, which dribbles down to your stomach and makes you nauseous, some doctors say. Olives, on the other hand, produce chemicals called tannins, which make your mouth dry. Hence, the theory goes, eating a couple of olives at the first hint of nausea can help diminish it, as may sucking on a mouth-puckering lemon.<br>  <br>  Soda crackers. They won't stop salivation, but dry soda crackers might help absorb the excess fluid when it reaches your stomach. Their "secret ingredients" are bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar.<br>  <br>  Coke syrup. Prescribed as an antinauseant for children, Coke syrup added to seltzer water may help. The same may be true for any carbonated cola beverage. See for yourself.<br>  <br>  Acupressure wristbands. Sold in many marine and travel shops, these lightweight wristbands have a plastic button that is supposed to be worn over what the doctors in the Orient call the Nei-Kuan acupressure point inside each wrist. The wearer is protected against nausea, the theory goes, by exerting pressure on the button for a few minutes.<br>  <br>  Above all Remember, Time heals all wounds. You may want to die, but your body will eventually adjust to the enviroment, but it might take a few days, but it will stop happening.|`|Guk39axNaa	maybe its because u cant take all that close up action or maybe you're just crazy|`|dmlV26VUaa	Contact a doctor.

On the first day, you can get 12 chocobo passes so you can ride as a lvl 1 character.  40 days later, you get the sprout and guide berets, that just set back the guide wearer's level to the sprout wearer's level.  At 100 days, you get a clock and at 365 you get a model airship.  Both are just pieces of furniture.  And if you're in if for the other items, rethink yourself.  You can either get lvl 1 def 1 items, or you can get items that you would normally obtain at the yearly events.  But if you're really insistent, see if anyone on your ls (if a 65 RDM like yourself doesn't have a linkshell, something's wrong) wants a mule, or get one yourself.  It's an extra dollar a month for another eighty spaces of storage.  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Supermidget, 41mnk/20war on Caitsith

And If you make your cow pregnant, you can wait for your youngest cow to give milk, and that one to have a calf so you can milk her again. That way you have 2 cows you can milk, and a possible 3rd one on the way.|`|4fb12a44c5ddc260be59333502d753b4aa	It is really a male cow you are trying to "milk".

Also Rogues and Warlocks are overpopulated on Horde and underpopulated on Allience, where mages the other way around.|`|N8th2Fmwaa	I agree with the dude above me ;p|`|VTcDXTijaa	Well it all depends on you, in my opinion, no class is greater than the other. They all have there pros and cons. Warlocks use the minion to help fight, mages use magic and frost armour, rogues deal a lot more damage but are lousy ranged shooters. Go to www.worldofwarcraft.com and on the left there should be a link that says classes, scroll of that and click each class to see the pros and cons of each. Hope you have fun playing

It takes a long time to do it correctly.  or you can find someone who all ready has the achievement(me) and you can make an account that you don't use, send that person the info so they can download it, glitch that account, give it back to you, and you can glitch it.

xfzvfr37aa	1: Jump on the Koopa and ram his shell into the enemies. Drop down the hole to<br>  your right and get a couple coins. When you see the coin arrow, activate Joy<br>  and fly up to a platform where the first Toad is.<br>  <br>  2: Drop down and continue. Scoop<br>  a Bob-omb and run to the end. Quickly toss it at the blue hover thing for<br>  coins. Jump across the platforms and go down the pipe. Go right and you'll find<br>  a puzzle piece. Go back and jump across the gap. Burn the bridge with Rage and<br>  free the second Toad<br>  <br>  3: .Enter the pipe. You'll notice there are mushrooms of 3 colors: red, blue, and purple. The<br>  mushrooms are all jumping different heights, with red being the weakest jumper,<br>  blue being next strongest, and purple being the best jumper. Jumping has<br>  nothing to do with it; you only need to worry about the color. Go down the pipe<br>  on the right.<br>  Hit the flowers in the same order the mushrooms were in; red, blue, purple. You<br>  are also timed; take too long and you'll have to start over. Go down the pipe<br>  on the right. Now there are four mushrooms. Go down the pipe on the right.<br>  Strike the flowers in the order red, purple, blue, red. Continue.<br>  <br>  Five mushrooms this time: blue, purple, red, red, blue.<br>  <br>  Strike the flower next to you. Drop down left and nail the purple one. Take the<br>  green platform up to the top and jump to the next area. Jump up and fall down<br>  to take out a red flower. Drop to where the first blue flower was and fall<br>  right to get the other red flower. Then use the platform or Joy to reach the<br>  top. Fall to hit the last flower. Eat the Bob-omb. Go down the newly-formed<br>  pipe to end this little mini-game.<br>  <br>  Hit the Piranha Plant and move along.<br>  <br>  You'll need to use Bowlbrella here. You can't whack while in the water, but if<br>  you jump and scoop, you can take out the Cheep Cheeps. If you have Floatbrella,<br>  you can just float over it. The hole is bad this time, avoid falling down it.<br>  Bowlbrella your way across the water and down the pipe you go.<br>  <br>  Time to combine vibes! Go to the sprout and activate Gloom. Jump up the stalk<br>  and fire up Joy. Free the final Toad. End the level.

AA10922520	Both systems are well worth getting so it depends on what you want.  If you play online a lot and like a really well done internet gaming system, then the 360 may be better for you even with the RROD (I have a 360 that had the issue and while it was fixed for free, but it still took a good amount of time for that to happen.  I hear the fix time is less now though).  <br>  <br>  The PS3 is also a great investment for gaming.  It has the wireless connection, free online play and the wireless system isn't bad althoug not as developed as LIVE.  It also gives a blu-ray player, which if you're into or going to be into HD movies is awesome.  <br>  <br>  Either way, both systems are great and will serve you well.|`|Hvuqv6duaa	well, i got a xbox360 and i love it. i've never got the red ring or anything, so i think it's worth it..|`|tnLUZ6UKaa	xbox 360 is a very good system and microsoft is coming out with a slew of new titles (exclusive rights to final fantasy XIII) <br>  and upgrades (blue ray player) to the current console. <br>  the xbox 360 longevity is a huge question mark. a friend of mine bought a two year warranty and just he replaced his 360 after the red ring showed up (he averages very little game play, maybe a couple hours per week). the 360 is worth having and the future looks good for the company however i would purchase a warranty with it so it can be replaced as the red ring is a big issue. <br>  i have the PS3 and i enjoy it immensely, particularly the blue-ray player and the controllers are way better than the 360's cumbersome <br>  controller.

AA12233489	The key things are to remember that Mac will not die and he does a lot of killing for you, and that the enemies will keep coming for ever to SURVIVAL is the goal not wiping them out.<br>  <br>  Set Macmillan down in the yellow circle to the side of the ferris wheel. He gives you his claymores and your job is to set these up in good places. <br>  <br>  One idea is to set them up behind the cars so that enemies seeking cover will die. Another choice would be to set all of them along a line so that you know some will at least be used. Either way, set them up near the grass, and don't set too many close to the wheel.<br>  <br>  Then you need to pick a sniping point. I would think either near his spot, or perhaps on the ferris wheel. But I seriously recommend a place near him.<br>  <br>  *NOTE: A cheap trick is to find a booth to the northeast of MacMillan's spot. What you can do here is fight off the enemies as usual, using the booth itself as cover. You can go prone in the corner adjacent to the doorway and under the table. This spot will keep you from any grenade damage, and you can guard the doorway, but no one should bother you. The only trouble is running to Mac when it's time.*<br>  <br>  The first wave is easy enough, all of the bad guys come from the pool area.  Try to get two in a row, and try to get them before they hit your bombs. If you start seeing too many go for the sides, always be ready to whip out the other rifle and start blasting away. If you take a lot of damage, run behind the ridge and go prone, or get to cover if you're somewhere else.<br>  <br>  *NOTE: To the southeast is a doorway that is usually shut. An intel is behind this door, so fight your way to the northeast corner by the pool and fence to choke off that enemy spawn point. Then you can go back to find the door is now open to let more guys through. The intel is on the ground. <br>  <br>  This is an advanced tip here, but staying at either the northeast or in this doorway will be excellent places to wait out the assault. Much easier than the booth or any other location. Trust me.*<br>  <br>  But that was too easy. Now helis will come in with lots of guys, and more will keep coming from the pool area. There's little solid strategy to this part, you just have to survive. Honestly, don't worry about getting too many kills, he will do a lot of shooting. All you should do is start chucking all your grenade types as your mines get used up. Then become more mobile and protect your flanks with your rifle, because they will get to your sides. Toss back grenades if you can, but just back off if you must. <br>  <br>  Mix between sniping and shooting as well, mainly because so many will get close. Just survive, that's the best advice.<br>  <br>  After what seems like forever, the bird lands in the parking lot. Run to Mac, pick him up, and hoof it to the back of the chopper. Run inside and you're done. |`|MOsJUNWVaa	You just gotta keep killing enemies ... Keep them off of your back long enough to escape to the helicopter. I know this mission is difficult but keep trying... |`|D7BztSujaa	Alright. I remember this level on Veteran, and I hated it. What i did was cheat a *tiny* bit. Before the cutscene kicks in, put the Cpt down and plant all your C4 in the field you're in, and put a few claymores here and there. <br>       Pick him back up, and he refills your explosives once you set him behind the ferris wheel. Plant some C4 on cars, and more around the parking lot. Plant claymores around the bumper car platform, generally in a circle. <br>       If you havent already, try and get an AK47 earlier in the level. Start sniping, and stay behind the platform. The claymores will alert you when enemies are near. Then you can switch to your AK and clean up anything that gets close. If they throw grenades, throw as many back as possible since they wont be cooked.<br>       Also, try and shoot troops off the ropes of the helicopters. Just keep your head down, and make every shot count. Believe me, waiting for the chopper is the easy part.<br>       Once the chopper gets there, I know you'll be anxious to get on it, but DO NOT RUSH. If you die, you go all the way back to when the second fleet of choppers arrives. Wait for the soliders on the chopper to set up a perimeter, then switch to your AK. Pop off anyone that's visible, and wait until its relatively safe to get on the chopper. I threw all the grenades i had left in random places, and used the explosions as cover.<br>     All in all, patience helps out a lot, with a bit of foward planning. It might take a try or 2, but you'll get it.|`|t8lzqwMoaa	There is two place's to set up. One is a gap near the drop were you came in the shoud be two or three trees in it. And also a set of double doors were enemy's come out of the first time your there.<br>  You should ditch the sniper for a RPD light machine gun and have a AK in chase you reload when a guy or dog is coming you can wholed them off there until the chopper is 1500m out it will start to come in alot quicker you should start move out then back to macmillan.<br>  <br>  The other is more difficult but closer to macmillan. Set up behind the Bumper cars well protected by mines and have C4 placed about the area and have the sniper for long range kills and a RPD for close range. <br>   Note that the 4 marines will draw alot of fire but not all of it when the chopper landsand that when your carrying Macmillan you can take about 10times more damage and also machillan is invincible and if you go to him and hide from 2500m to the choppper arrives you should live long enough to pick him up as long as you push ed back the enemys a good bit.|`|OUsyNnW7aa	Ok, the best way is; to do it once but keep in mind where most enemys come from... on your next play through plant mines and keep them as far as you can by picking them off with your sniper. then by about 2500/2000m they'll be close enough for you to switch to your other gun. throw grenades every once in a while to. they come from 1 place which is the same place u enter the area from, so plant a few mines there. i usualy sit by the bumper cars, but if you sit here you need to watch your right aswell as they tend to go round the building and try flank you. just be careful though, watch your health and try keep them as far as you can. |`|x0onYDSEaa	plant claymores in a circle round you and just keep killing soldiers and if they get to close, the mines will blow up and you will no they are there + they will get blown tobits.<br>  <br>  other option is cheat :P |`|YbCxbkO6aa	The most important thing in succeeding in this mission would be to know how to switch targets quickly using the triggers.<br>  Using this technique i have completed it on hardened/veteran -<br>  Put MacMillan down and plant your claymores around the cars and around the ferris wheel, any gaps the enemies will run through, the claymores will blow up the cars for increased damage.<br>  Use the sniper for the first wave, picking them off at a distance.<br>  When alot more arrive you should run behind the bumper cars, near that white gate, letting them come to you, pick them off with the trigger switching. MacMillan will be fine as he cannot die in this mission, so dont worry about him.<br>  By running behind the bumper cars you avoid being directly shot and mainly you can take out the enemies fairly quickly and efficiently.<br>  Throw grenades at groups of enemies as they are alot harder to take down. Continue the strategy until the helicopter arrives.<br>  Once it has arrived, shoot any enemies near Mac Millan, i would advise you wait for the soldiers to get out of the helicopter until you pick him up as they will provide cover.<br>  Pick up Mac Millan and just leg it inside the helicopter.|`|1ZPhqpFeaa	I found it easiest to set down Macmillan right where the chopper comes to pick you guys up. Then go on the platform of the ferris wheel. Place all of your claymores on the stairs behind you. That way, the only way enemy soldiers can get to your position will be to take the stairs right in front of you. Then go into the prone position in the middle of the platform and start picking off enemies as they enter your view. If anyone does get to the ferris wheel, then they will either go to the rear stairs and die by a claymore or run to the front stairs and as soon as you can see them, they will stand still. Every time I've done this they've run into my scope while I was trying to snipe people on the far end of the area.|`|tVppApQLaa	When you arrive at the area. do not put Mc million down in the correct spot place him anywhere. use the rest of your c4 and claymore. i suggest placing them next to cars along the fence and anywhere random. pick mc million back up and place him in the correct spot on the hill. <br>  <br>  By this moment he will give all of his claymore's and C4, so place them randomly or where ever, again i suggest the fence line adn cars. quickly run over to where the big buildings are. when you place him down look back to where u have come from and go north east into the far right alleyway between the 2 buildings. on the left of the alleyway will be a little corner crouch there and do nothing until the plane starts to arrive. Mc millin will kill alot of the people and your 24 clamours :) will do alot aswell. <br>  <br>  Before the plane is about to arrive look out towards the ferries wheel and pick off any easy people. if your hit once quickly go back into the corner for saftety. once the helicopter lands, blow your c4 and sprint out behind the helicopter around the ferries...if low on health prone and wait. sprint to Mc million pick him up. <br>  <br>  NOTE: When u hold Mc million you have 5x health :). run back behind the ferries, behind the helicopter then run into it. once your in you cant get hurt. i suggest at this point do a rappid fire and throw all your grenades :). <br>  <br>  happy killing.|`|QTh9pcI5aa	Ok this plan worked for me.<br>  <br>  Firstly where you put the Cpt down crouch or lie down next to him or just behind him and ever few seconds pop up and take out some guys. Plus the cpt will clear alot out then after half way of the heli-copter coming get up and run to the right where the bumpers are at and hide behind a little hit there and clear more of the enemies. Then when the heli-copter is near run back to the Cpt and crouch behind him again till the heli-copter arrives.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|AA12220406	<br>  the best thing is tht go to the right side of the ferris wheel u will see a deck, find a place there where u can see most of the area then prone there dont stay there for tht long then start moving around and kill them<br>  when the chopper come there are total of three u can kill all the poeple in 2 of the chopper the third 1 u cant wht u do is then they rope down just shoot them a hit will be engough so dont try getting a head shot where ever they get hit will be enough<br>  then near then end when your chopper say will nearly there (cant remember want it really says) then ditch the sniper then pick a assulat rifle then that gun will lead u to the end <br>  <br>  |`|uOvG255Waa	UM If you wanna quick and easy way:<br>  <br>  Put him down in the right spot.

The events for those Pokemon's are not available anymore so if you want to keep them you should keep your save game. Another option is to trade your Darkrai and Shaymin to a friend then start a new game, choose a cool name, get to be able to trade and then ask to trade back...

ZNeadVNXaa	Vintage is the new name for the former type 1 tournament format. All card sets are legal in this set (with black or white borders) and It had a list of banned(cannot play) and restricted( only one of) cards. <br>  <br>  Legacy is the new type 1.5 format, all sets are legal, and it has it's own banned list of cards, no restricted list. Type 1.5 used to have all cards restricted in type 1 as banned cards but as this format progressed Wizards decided it better to have it's own banned list that would make other cards still playable. <br>  <br>  Legacy came about as players found it harder to find the power 9 cards (moxes, lotus bloom, time walk, etc.) affordable. There are other reasons, but I think this is the most common answer. <br>  <br>  One big differencethat Vintage has over Legacy is that one-turn kill combo decks are the norm in Vintage, as the original moxes and power 9 cards can stil be used. Legacy doesn't have these cards, so powerful one-turn kills are more dependant on fewer key cards. <br>  <br>  Both formats allow players to use all legal sets for Magic, so that appeal for long time players is there.
syrJCT3Taa	A fairy riding a bicycle?  That's just ridiculous.<br>  <br>  However, in the Pacific Northwestern US a certain juggling fairy is quite common.  We call her Tinkerfoot, and she is most commonly sighted riding a moose and juggling vegetables.  Seeing her is always a powerful omen, and the vegetables she is seen juggling are key to interpreting her message.  Being a long-time member of the Tinkerfoot Sighting Interpretation Club, I know that seeing her in late winter or early spring juggling six carrots and an onion is a sign that the Sasquatch mating season will be unusually frenzied that year-- that they will certainly be terrorizing our livestock, digging through our garbage, attempting to mate with our cars, and causing significant property damage.  I'd be quite terrified if your fairy had been on moose back, but since she wasn't, I can only conclude that you're mad.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	i see everyday in london,fairy's riding bikes and juggling through the traffic|`|z8jYprWkaa	Can I have some of what you're on please !|`|HQl6Smqxaa	!?!?!

B9JwxyRfaa	This looks okay now, but you can definitely change some of these cards.<br>  <br>  If you're just going to run 1 D.D. Dynamite, just take it out and replace it with a third Solemn/Prison/Mirror Force.<br>  <br>  Phoenix Wing Wind Blast is only effective in a deck which requires getting cards to the Graveyard to be effective, like the now-dead TeleDad or maybe Zombies.  Exchange it for two Bottomless Trap Holes for no-frills removal.<br>  <br>  BotL is kind of slow and isn't really that useful any more.  Also, it gets sacked pretty easily with Laquari and Wulf running around.  Replace it, along with Gren Maju Da Eiza, for more Monarchs or 3 Cyber Valleys and another Dimensional Fissure.<br>  <br>  Find a way to add in Allure of Darkness.  I suggest trading out the two D.D. Warriors for two copies of it.<br>  <br>  You don't need Helios to activate Macro, and other than as a toolbox monster for Monarchs it really isn't that effective, especially when compared to D.D. Survivor's field returning capabilities.<br>  <br>  The three most effective monarchs available are Raiza, Caius, and Thestalos.  Although Mobius can effectively be side decked against a Limit Reverse abusing Yubel deck or any deck that revolves around Ultimate Offering/some field spell like Zombie World, it isn't all that effective anymore due to the fact that traps aren't as effective as they once were.|`|yzpU5fZJaa	i think it's great. good job. i would add 2 trechorous trap ho0le since all your cards are removed, you wont have any traps in the grave.|`|TOilCuG3aa	looks pretty good <br>  <br>  8/10|`|d2X4wwiyaa	Very nice deck, I am a big fan of macro cosmos.  However I would recommend removing gren maju de eiza and primordial sun to add 3 cyber valleys.  From experience these are great adding some draw power and picking up the speed to what is sometimes a slow deck.  I would also get rid of D. D. Dynamite to replace it with another spell or trap because dynamite is too situational.  Karma cut is a good card removing a face up monster from play.  Especially in competitive duels the is few face downs, with some exceptions.  Enemy controller and Brain control are very useful in monarch decks.  Furthermore heavy storm and giant trunade may end up doing more harm then good destroying your fissure or macro which is very important.  That applies to Heavy storm more so.  Overall those are just some small suggestions it looks very good.

I have both games and I can only get to the last level with Team Rose!! and that's only because Team Rose has the easiest difficulty Rate EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! Shadow The Hedgehog lets you use  a larger set of moves AND, it lets you choose to be good or bad!!!!! But, what is REALLY cool is that in a certain level if you kill guys from the Goverment, you can grab heal capsules and when you heal them, They won't attack you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's different with Robots and Black creatures though, they won't attack you at first but if you exit and then re-enter that room,they will attack you again but, humans will stay loyal to you forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!

cO10thlnaa	That is more than enough to run WoW nicely at high settings. There may or may not be some times when you need to turn some graphical effects down though, such as during raids.|`|zHRFHO93aa	That's a nice setup.  When I first started playing WoW I was trying to run it with just the pre-installed graphics card and not surprisingly it sucked pretty bad.  I ended up having to buy a new pc (a great excuse to buy one actually).  As the guy above me said, make sure you have plenty of RAM, it makes the game so much more enjoyable to play, silky smooth even in raids.  Get as much as you can!|`|k1YsporDaa	The biggest thing for WoW is three things:<br>  1. Internet connection (don't want to be in a fight for 10 hours just to be knocked off by the phone or wi-fi crapping out)<br>  2. RAM( the more the better)<br>  3. The best graphics card you can find<br>  <br>  Outside of that, the rest is just meeting minimal running requirements. I play on a crappy PC with XP from four years ago I bought from a crackhead for $20 but I just upgraded the graphics card and put in 4gigs of ram with broadband connnection and don't have a bit of problems playing or running it.<br>  <br>  As far as other games, the only thing you may have problems with is Crysis (but I have yet to meet ANYONE who hasn't had some kind of problem). All the others should run fine.

Also, because the DSi will have all the RAM and the browser itself built in, the device itself will be less clumsy. I think the DSi has a very good chance at having superior online to the PSP.|`|AJ1vAIBvaa	Playstation Network owns all console networks.. PERIOD|`|UVdRnx8Faa	PSP definitely|`|0lWB2SUwaa	In my opinion the DS is way better for games.<br>  <br>  For internet the PSP owns the DS.

mOTCr8Pxaa	It's the wii not the disc. SSBB was the first dual layered disc game for the Wii and it was noted by Nintendo themselves that some Wii's would not be able too or have a hard time reading the data on the disc due to a lazer not really meant for that kind of disc. Especially the first Wii's during it's initial release. The problem was remedied in newer production wii's. Nintendo will fix this for free as it was a manufacturers defect. I do not know if they will pay for shipping though.|`|CYBtdtt7aa	Hmmm <br>  <br>  It sounds like the disc is faulty. Try it with another game and if that dosent work then your Wii is in bad condition.
MOwFjIhtaa	I use Delta Ceramcoat A LOT! It is good for wood, plastic, paper mache, styrofoam, plaster, metal, etc. Depending on the surface, you may need to seal it. You can also use it on fabric, although it will flake off eventually. If you want to use it on fabric, you can actually get fabric paint medium to mix with it. <br>  <br>  I have painted wooden and paper mache boxes, styrofoam balls, wooden frames, glass Christmas balls (the ones you decorate yourself), rocks, and probably other things I can't think of right now! :) Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Kaeleigh<br>  divinecreations1.etsy.com<br>  |`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	Depends on how well you prepare the surface. Sometimes<br>  you have to sand lightly first. The acrylic paint usually will<br>  list the material it will cover. If I remember correctly it will<br>  cover wood, plaster, paper mache,and metal if it is prepare<br>  correctly. I wouldn't use it on glass or plastic. Hope this helps.
LCJrsEh3aa	I got one from ebay, it was a motorola, cost me ￡5 and was utter Crap. Waste of money.<br>  I use the one i got with my mobile.

wvhyTrYPaa	i actually learned about securom three months ago and i've been buying and installing all the sims2 since they came out.  i haven't had any unusual problems with them and i'm installed them on three different pc's from different years and computer stuff.  i wouldn't be scared if i were you.  apartment life is really cool i suggest that one|`|Ju5azN0Kaa	My favorite of those is Apartment Life.  I love it.<br>  <br>  Then Bon Voyage.  Also very very fun.<br>  <br>  Freetime is also fun, but the other two are better.|`|hwQFrXxFaa	Why not Sims Seasons? I have it and love it! But if I had to choose between the two I would say Apartment life. I would buy it but I am waiting for Sims 3 to come out :)|`|JRKQBto4aa	I have Sims 2 free time and I LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!|`|Ng4UNMV7aa	Apartment Life is definitely the best out of those three. I don't use Bon Voyage very often. It was fun going on vacation at first, but then it just got annoying.<br>  <br>  It's so much fun having an apartment. Many new interactions, furniture...it's a whole different gameplay.|`|xB7nLzuHaa	I have bon voyage but i rarely use it. I think apartment life would be cool

It is a pack of 5 games for only ￡20. The games are, Half Life 2(HL2), HL2 episode 1, HL2 episode 2, Portal and Team Fortress 2(TF2). They are all singleplayer games except TF2 which is a online multiplayer game with many game modes.<br>  There is also the Counter Strike Source pack which has 3 games and is ￡15 i think. These games include Counter Strike Source(CSS), Day of Defeat(DOD) and HL2 Deathmatch(HL2 dm).All these game are multiplayer games.<br>  All these games are made by Valve and are excellent and i recommend u buy them. U need a program called Steam, which is free, to run these games and the link to the download for it is in my sources.<br>  Also new game which has recently come out and is made by Valve is Left 4 Dead which is also and excellent multiplayer game and can also be played singleplayer.

mOTCr8Pxaa	You can. But it's not the cheated pokemon that can damage the game it's the act of cheating. But cheated pokemon will be rejected by the GTS. The coding is different and therefore rejected.|`|iLKtzK0jaa	yes i did it loads of times|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Yes,you can.
oK57gmbDaa	Online is the only place I am sure of
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Online only.  With the way people cheat offline, the uber bosses would be no match.

The guy's made awesome flas-based remakes of some classics such as snake, pac-man, galga etc.
cO10thlnaa	Very low. The E4's levels can range from the low to high 50's, so unless you have a high supply of revives, full restores, ethers and other recovery items, you may not be able to do it at that point. Try getting them all to atleast 55, maybe 60+ or so.|`|nbuQ8OUsaa	would remove seaking and replace it with dailga/palkia then odds would be good.<br>  <br>  currently, quite low. make sure to stock up on loads of items.|`|2dNCdm8Qaa	Not that Likely. I have a level 72 INFERNAPE yet I still can't beat them! however, there is a strategy I am working on. First, get a sneasel, level it up, (evolve it if needed) and teach it BEAT UP. BEAT UP lets all Pokemon in your party to attack one after the other! So, if you hit them with powerful Poke'mon over and over again... well, you know. But, the power of your sneasel Really maters (I think) but, do as they said and bring ALL the healing items possible .|`|LXRCZN9Eaa	i would say it would be best to train them to level 60 or higher because of the fire type guy the highest level in the pokemon leage is 66 so yeah i would say 78%-100% hope i helped!|`|71oENb44aa	i would say you can beat it just take some revives,max potions, and ethers ,to heal your pokemon after every pokemon battle|`|zXpbfBcuaa	it EASY

YNyye3NZaa	Yo! Great choice in websites! AirSplat is the most respected one! Mad props to them. <br>  <br>  They ship out their orders in 24 hours, so you shoudl get it soon. Sometimes I get it next day cause I'm close. But if you're far, it'll take longer. It'll never be longer than a week though and that's if you're all the way on the east side.|`|GRRpbWLoaa	Air splat is a great place!  They have the best prices online, really fast shipping and great service.  They usually can ship out your order within 24 hours of placing it, and the actual shipping time depends on where you are.  You can check out their UPS shipping schedule posted on the following link: <a href="http://www.airsplat.com/images/UPSgroundMap.gif." rel="nofollow">http://www.airsplat.com/images/UPSground...</a>|`|PPnYJD0laa	okay ..ups ground takes about 5 days to get to NY. So depending on where you are it can take less. I found out Airsplat is open mon - fri. so if you ordered in on fri. it should go out mon. which is considered their next business day.<br>  <br>  And if the item is in stock it will ship out, if its not ..nothing will go out.<br>  <br>  You should call them so they can give you exact info.|`|9Djep77Vaa	I ordered an airsoft rifle from them a while back. As I recall, it took less than a week to get it. Didn't they give you a UPS tracking number? If you put that in on the UPS site, you can see exactly where it is and when it will arrive. Hope that helps and enjoy it!|`|QqQ6Hghuaa	You will probably get your gun before this question is even answered!!! They ship out of southern california. If you ordered it on saturday, you are looking at getting it by friday!!! Depends on what state you live in... Why dont you call them and ask!?! goodluck with your gun!|`|6XbJPwAuaa	i would say 3-4 business days. but it also depends on what state your in.<br>  airsplat.com is fast though. me and my brother order from them all the time.|`|Oig8TTRJaa	That depends where you're located. But regular UPS GROUND shipping is no more than 5 business days.|`|X9omAqwgaa	It all depends on where you live! I think ground is the way they go!
YQMCVuFiaa	Your Router/Modem may also have an internal firewall/security setting that you need to bypass, not just a software firewall.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.portforwarding.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.portforwarding.com/</a>
YQMCVuFiaa	Make sure your pop-up blocker is temporarily disabled, or allow pop-ups to show from Yahoo! Games.<br>  (Tools --> Internet Options for default pop-up blocker)<br>  <br>  If this is not the problem, make sure you have Java installed and updated. Most, if not all, of the Yahoo games require Java to run and do not give you the option to download from the game page.
cO10thlnaa	Restart your modem by unplugging it for 30 seconds then plugging it back in. This will allow your modem to clear out the IP cache data from your PC and give your 360 it's own settings. You will need to do the same when you change the connection back to your PC.
obKSk23aaa	It could be that the drive is malfunctioning. Put in another CD/DVD (any one) and see if the drive recognizes the disc. If not, then:<br>  <br>  Go into your Device Manager and see if there is an error on the CD/DVD drive. to do that:<br>  1) right-click on "My Computer" (in the START menu or on the Desktop), left-click Manage and click on Device Manager and locate the Drive.<br>  <br>  If you don't see it there then it's probably bad. Another way you can check it is to restart your computer altogether, enter the system BIOS and check to see if it's in there.<br>  <br>  All of that is just to determine if you need a new DVD drive or not.<br>  <br>  If you really want to play it, and don't want to but a new DVD drive just yet - here's what you can do:<br>  <br>  Share the CD/DVD drive of another computer on the network with yours, this way you can have the disc in someone else computer (which must be on) and play the game in yours. I've done that many times when I had to play DVD games off of my brother's computer since I didn't have a DVD drive on mine (a long long time ago (^_^) . . .6 yrs (?_?!))<br>  <br>  If everything is fine with your drive, If you installed it using that same drive, then you can just uninstall and try it again.|`|e75HSwKuaa	Auto-run may be Disabled on your computer so go to Start--->My computer--->Local disk--> and you should see sims 2  then double click it and it should pop up !
xsELhjl4aa	Id say it should only take a week or so longer dude next time you want a disc fixed go to somewhere like blockbuster in your home town because they fix your games and there is no shipping and handling also its much much quicker|`|y34LvcKtaa	Why didn't you just get it replaced at the store you bought it from...<br>  <br>  That's quite a long time.  I would call or email them to find out what the situation is.
MlsaNhb3aa	i dont know much about what he is talking about but ireally dont care about the storyline, i care about the online play...im fine with the same guns and all but new maps would be awsome!!!<br>  im uber excited to get it but if you are on a budget rent it or borrow it from a friend...also read reveiws and go to g4tv.com and look up what they have to say (though i dont think they have anything on it yet)|`|szHv7Dvyaa	Its going to flat out SUCK. My cousin is a beta tester and i played for a bit on his 360 and honestly it's worse than COD5 and thats pretty hard to do.  I would not get it.  Wait to buy it, rent it first.  I hated it 2/10 cuz it has no story line and it is soooooooooooooooooo stupid.

AA11494433	That depends entirely on what you want to do. I think the more popular classes are rogue and hunter. But personally, I enjoy playing paladins the most. Their high armor class and healing spells make them near impossible to kill when fighting creatures. Back around when I first started, my level 44 paladin was able to kill things 5 levels higher. <br>  <br>  Priests are nice, and always needed in groups (if they're healers), but they are kind of bothersome to level up solo unless they are shadow priests. A priest is currently my main character. Not having as much fun as I did when I was a paladin and farming is kind of awkward.<br>  <br>  I couldn't really get into the hunter class for some reason, but rogues are fun - especially in PvP. <br>  <br>  What I'd suggest doing is going to the WoW website and read through the class descriptions, and pick which ones seem like fun to you. Then make a character of each class you feel interested in, and play each one a little to get a feel for their abilities. :) Try out different races too. <br>  <br>  My favorite starting areas are:<br>  <br>  Human - Elwynn Forest - Fun and peaceful, easy quests, the newbie area is very near a big city (Stormwind). The atmosphere is great. Humans also get a 5% bonus to reputation gains which will be a good thing in later levels.<br>  <br>  Undead - Tirisfal Glades - A very dark atmosphere, and very interesting quests. One of my favorite places to level. I also (personally) think horde is better than alliance, but on some servers, horde population is very low. I'd definitely reccomend trying out an undead character and playing in their newbie zone though.<br>  <br>  Tauren - Mulgore - The tauren have a really nice line of fun quests. If you're into a kind of native american/nature feel, you might wana try them out. <br>  <br>  I got bored kinda easily with night elf, gnome/dwarf, orc/troll quests. Darnassus (night elf city) is a very beautiful city, though.<br>  <br>  In any case, whatever you pick, I hope that you have fun. If you pick Thunderhorn server on the Alliance side, feel free to send me a whisper with any questions you might have. I'm starting to level up a new paladin (her name is Decadence) so I will probably be on her a lot. :)<br>  <br>  P.S. - If you pick a priest, you might want to try making it a dwarf. Dwarven priests have a racial spell called "fearward" that many higher level guilds like having for fights.|`|AA12148054	whats world of warcraft anyway i choose hunter|`|AA11123408	Join the Spinebreaker server, on the alliance side, and play a hunter.   send a message to Aggromancer, and i'll get you into a good guild.<br>  <br>  I can help you out and answer any other questions you might have.  There are many pros and cons to discuss.
