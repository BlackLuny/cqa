W2R8TRDmaa	Bad game by the officials but I don't think there was any unfair bias.  The refs have a tough job and sometimes they miss calls.  They don't have the luxury of watching dozens of slow mo replays from 10 angles.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Agreed!      Wilson tripped and fell into the kick holder..bad call.    Arizona had to use two challenges to have two calls over-turned.  They shouldn't have to use them.  Get it right on the field.    Warner's arm was definitely going forward on the last Hail Mary attempt.  To not even review it is a shame.    Harrison should have been ejected for what he pulled in the 4th Quarter.    Hines Ward should have been flagged twice for Personal Fouls for the crap he did.    The late hit called on Roethlisberger was a fair and clean hit...refs are turning QBs into a bunch of pansies.    Need it go on?|`|9DjZBjHmaa	Hey, the rules are the rules.  The refs are seeing this all in real-time and make the calls as they see them, or don't see them.  Every game is always going to have some questionable calls.  But, if you look at the rule, verbatim, chances are you can get yourself to understand why they called it.|`|4v0bhxsIaa	Yes it was fair game Arizona's secondary got seriously gashed there was no safety support from SS Aaron Francisco, who should not be in the NFL, Anyway you look at it Arizona's front 4 put real pressure on Big Ben, who played straight up ball.  Rodrick Hood, Adrian Wilson, and Aaron Francisco blew their assignments in the cover 2 and 3 scheme which unfortunately left Cromartie-Rodgers on an Island too many times, a rookie. So the game is over and Arizona won't be back. In my book Kurt Warner played an awesome game in all the Superbowl's he has played in it was  his teams defense that always choked at the end.  The Cards secondary really needed to be more disruptive on Steeler receivers, by checking them off the line of scrimmage.  That was what was missing.|`|4t28hLrIaa	you made me change my mind,i think it was  bull ****!go cardinals (im from arizona)|`|9wf5wmukaa	yeah there was a lot of unfair calls and since i live in arizona doesn't mean i like the cardinals but the arizona daily star shows that Santonio Holmes foot on the last touchdown wasnt all the way down it was like a centimeter away so that was an unfair call. then when Harrison  92 pushed the cardinals member then punched him, then pushed him again he should of be out of the game.|`|O1HwTBbqaa	I think the last play should have been reviewed to give AZ a chance ... but AZ could have won the game had they thrown the ball to Fitz earlier in the game|`|CO2o0YYMaa	The game was rigged. The Cardinals didn't deserve half of those penalties. The last play was an incomplete pass. His hand was going forward. My friend told me that one of the refs had money on the Steelers to win it.|`|lHDff8Braa	Yeah, I agree, that holding call resulting in a safety was bogus!    *rolls eyes*|`|AA11828439	Fair! Not even the Cardinals agree with you.|`|eqDXoCeTaa	I'm not a Cards fan, but there were some very questionable calls.|`|OuRnSBU6aa	The refs should havef stopped throwing their terrible towels everywhere and call a better game. They have to let these teams play football. For Example, on the Roughing the Passer play against Arizona, The Arizona player had all his speed and full momentum going, and was also very close to Big Ben at the time. Do the refs expect that big man running with all his power to just stop?      They also should have reveiwed the last play.|`|GHusBLjgaa	Arizona did not lose the game because of the refs. They lost the game on Harrison's pick 6 right before half. That play swung the game 14 points, as not only did the cards not get the TD, the Steelers ended up with a TD right before half.     That said though the fact that last play was not reviewed is unforgrivable. It looked like his arm was coming foreword. For a play that important in a game that important the play has to be reviewed.|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	there were bad calls on both sides of the football. the bottom line was the steelers hit the cards in the mouth, suprisingly, the cards kept there composure and threw a few hay-makers themselves and made a good game out it.look guys, the cards were a 9-7 team, they wasn't that good, but on the big stage they stood up and played hard...hat's off to them...but do you guy's reall think they could have won!!! the steelers have been doing this all season, with injuries and all. so stop trying to discredit the steelers...THEY ARE THE CHAMP....AND I'M A COWBOYS FAN. NUFF SAID|`|BMEMH7JLaa	The last play should have been reviewed.|`|scdOQ2CAaa	i think that ref was just tired of the sidelines  and wanted some camera action!    106 yds of penalties?     and the steelers barely pull it off..    Cards ARE the better team    get ready for the decline of the steelers the cardinals showed everyone that the steelers defense will no longer be number 1 they had no idea on how to stop the cards recievers.

ToxDHYsaaa	no not really you lost loads on defoe, keane isn't getting any younger, chimbonda is probably the worst defender in the premier league surely going from wigan to spurs to sunderland back to spurs shows this, pelacios time will tell, and Cudicini conceded 3 goals on saturday and you spent at least 50 million haha good dealing! typical spurs fans, you really don't no nothing have you not seen whats happened to pompey look where we are now because of redknapp the same will happen to you and you won't be able to wipe the smile of my face when it does!!|`|kovBZS8saa	the main thing is spurs have got a brilliant manager in harry redknapp. i support liverpool and im gutted rafa didnt give keano a chance. i think spurs could be in the top 5 next season,still along way off being a great club though.|`|TKDi70uTaa	well the spurs board cannot be accused of not trying. lets hope they do the business and we can sell of the players who were'nt in the summer.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I DO hope that Spurs get back on track.|`|XU1KaWXwaa	enjoy keane, he's liverpool history though, and thanks for the goals which im sure helped us when torres was injured.|`|3638ecbacff09303c04d9f60a89e841baa	On the surface yes! but lets face it chimbonda Keane and Defoe are what some might call joke signings as they were yours in the beginning io wished Wenger had sold ans resigned the entire squad at least it would have looked impressive.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	i think spurs should sign arshavin and downing,not robbie keane|`|peFtORvUaa	made 5 million profit on keane.|`|sm0COFLTaa	I'm sure they will all enjoy their few months and then leave as soon as you are relegated.|`|AA12370193	good dealing only if it pays off.

It just goes to show the damage Commoli did before he was sacked.  He had no idea.

Lb811SzCaa	I hate when fans pull this. They lost the game because of the pick at the end of the first half and because the defense could not stop Pittsburgh on the final drive. Yes the refs sucked last night and blew some calls against the Cards. However, the Cards got two of them reversed on challenges. At the end of the day they still needed to make the plays (and almost did). Don't ruin one of the greatest superbowls by blaming the refs people.|`|051viISDaa	I'm not of fan of either team, but it appeared to me that the Steelers got away with alot of holding and the refs never called them.....it was a great game though, one of the best Superbowls in a long time.|`|ndopqX6Taa	They should be more pissed about the Defensive Coordinator going into nickel and dime coverage rather than keeping with the pressure that resulted in negative yards up until the final drive. But instead they let Ben sit in the pocket and pick them apart. That had more to do with them losing than any call.    And just for the record there could have been twice as many holding penalties against Arizona. That guy was completely overmatched by Harrison.|`|obPSaYf3aa	There was actually one play early in the game when the Steelers had the ball, and Ben committed a "delay of game" penalty when the time expired and continued an additional 10 seconds before they snapped the ball.  I'm surprised that the Steelers, announcers, timekeepers, refs and Cardinals did not notice it happened.    I'm a 49er's fan but really enjoyed the game!  Congratulations to the Steelers for their win!|`|c6d39e78cfedb00968db18e9aaafac51aa	Nobody is saying anything about Fitzgerald's first TD. The ball hit the ground. That play should have been reversed.|`|RNYWzREEaa	they are justt bitter aboutt their suckish team tooo bad cards fans your team sucks join steeler nation its better the refs for the mist part wre fine holmes td was totaally a touchdown both feet were in the enzone take a look at the pix online     sorry to all you bitter cards fans but we just ripped off your wings...sorry    oh yeah how many rings do the cards have...six? more like none!!!!    ouch   if you need something to wipe your tears you can borrow my terrible towel!!!!!|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	I was pulling for the Cards. I feel the Cards received a bad call or 2 during the game, but they had their opportunities to win the game and they came up a little short. I don't feel that you can blame the refs for the loss. I generally don't believe in blaming the refs.|`|ECTwMoHaaa	Because they are a bunch of whiners.  The better team won.|`|OuRnSBU6aa	The Refs didn't screw one team or another, they threw flags both ways.|`|GHusBLjgaa	I am not a Cardinals fan, there were bad calls all over the place. That said though even though we will never know if it would have made a difference that last play needed to be reviewed.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	They can't handle losing.     Their OT was holding Harrison on every single play. Funny, they didn't seem to mind him getting away with it.|`|scdOQ2CAaa	uh because they did..|`|QGBSOpt7aa	because they are sore losers and dont realize they were only in that game because the refs decided to call a "hold" in the endzone so that Vegas could hit the over!!
jwm0kQvNaa	4    It was an OK game.  It definitely wasn't top 10.  Too many games that were played without controversy that were still a close game deserve to be rated higher (Niners v.

Bears (first time a black HC won the SB- a historic moment) those were all WAY better than this one.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	10 Greatest SB I ever saw and I've seen em' since the 70's.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	A 10, because the only team I like won the dang thing.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Player Skill: 7  Player Class: 9 (expect Harrison and Ward...Harrison gets a 2 and Ward gets a 5)  Officiating: 4...horrible job Terry!|`|ndopqX6Taa	7, 3 quarters of ok football followed by a fantastic 4th quarter.

No blowouts, only back and forth struggling!  I would rate this Super Bowl a 9.5 with Warner being in the receiving end of what the Rams did to the Titans.  Go Cards!!  Super Bowl 44 Champs!|`|3a0c551af182343c97509a84971a0d28aa	It was very good. Better than I'd expected.  I'd rate it up high:  8    GO CHARGERS 2009!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11097612	I would rate this Super Bowl a 8 because of all of the penalties on both sides of the line.  This was one of the most penalized Super Bowls that have been played.      The 99 yard return for a touchdown by Harrison was outstanding.  The go ahead touchdown by Fitzgerald was electrifying and the final drive directed by Rothlesberger and sealed by Holmes was edge of your seat drama unmatched by any but a few Super Bowls.    But the slopiness of play is what brought it down a couple of notches.  Harrison beating up the Cardinal player wasn't helping either.|`|Tdzk4o5Iaa	8, Only because the Eagles weren`t in it, I think it would been a bigger hype, and everyone wouldn`t had an automatic Assumption that the Steelers were going to win, which they did, over Arizona, and when the last second off 4th Qrt, Clock went to 0, That`s why everyone assumed that the Steelers were going to automactically win, because they did. So Sad to say it was just a Super Bowl that Went they Way it was suppose to as everyone predicted it, just alot of excitment of that maybe chance Warner won`t mess it up by throwing interceptions that get ran back for Touchdowns.|`|mdeUIpuTaa	9!!!|`|RGidjJm3aa	9.39 (seriously)|`|bppRqm6qaa	if i had to rate it by the excitement it would be a 10 but i don't like the steelers so 0|`|E1sqGzmtaa	10!!!!

The Cardinals were never an exciting team to begin with.  I was however a bit on the edge of my seat at the end of the game when the Cardinals made a come back within the last few minutes.  However the super bowl as a whole wasn't that great.  Last year's was better than this years.  I think everyone figured the Steelers would win because they are a better team overall.  But the super bowl wasn't that great mainly because it was predictable.  Also the super bowl ads were disappointing as well.|`|AA12370001	6 for etnertainment.  From a football standpoint it was a 2.  Poor play, but both teams were equally poor which made it competitive.|`|wxXguyK3aa	10|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	another ruined one. Ill give it a 3. The Seattle one was ALOTTTTTT worse though, I will say that. Anytime championships are handed to a team, its not a good game.  Its just not the people on here who know that they are winning championships this way, millions of people are starting to realize it.  When your on the world stage an people are seeing whats goin on, that does alot to damage your credibility.

knsbKlezaa	It's simple: There is a huge bias in the NFL HOF for the Denver Broncos. They have gone to like 5 Superbowl's and have how many HOFers? 2! and they both joined in the past 3 years!! Elway was a given because of him being top 3 quarterbacks of all time and Zimmerman didn't even play a lot of his career in Denver. Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe are both being snubbed and all because for some reason the HOF hates the Broncos. I live in Canton and am a huge Broncos fan and have only got to see 2 of my team's players in the parade. It's a shame.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	Whoa.  For one, Woodson IS a Top 5 DB of all time.  Secondly, the Bronco's aren't getting a biased treatment.  They had just as much exposure as anybody, having been to the playoffs as much as they did- not to mention the SB appearances.      How could a guy not be a focal point if he's the all-time leader in receptions for a TE?  McCaffery was more of the decoy in Denver's offense.    He only had Rod Smith for most of his career.  TD only played a couple of seasons, Ed Mac was never THAT big of a threat.    Chris Carter is the 2nd best WR ever, statistically.  Plus, he's waited longer than Sharpe.  Ralph Wilson helpped changed the AFL-NFL into what you know today.      Nobody that got in was more deserving.  Nobody that was left out was less deserving.  It's only going to get worse.  There is going to be a huge influx of "first-ballot ability" (Jerry Rice, to name one) players in the next few years.      Basically, I wouldn't hold my breath anytime soon.  When he does get in, and he will, just be thankful that he is.|`|dfo8gSaraa	I agree, Sharpe was a 1st ballot lock!    Shannon was the all time TE receiving leader before Tony Gonzales broke the record this season.    Shannon probably won't get in now for 2-3 years. Rice, Emmitt Smith are 1st balloters next season.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	U have a great point and he is a first ballot but u have others to recognize as well and they can't put over 6 people in at one time. Not everyone can get in on the 1st shot|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Ok, which inductee would you have left off?    Woodson? No  Thomas? No  Smith? No  McDaniel? No  Hayes? No (every class must have one older player)    This leaves only Ralph Wilson who could have waited a year or two but I think building a team which made 4 straight Super Bowls is a greater achievement than anything Sharpe did.    Sharpe will get in but he doesn't decisively top any of these 6 men    edit:   Are you kidding?  Woodson is the most obvious lock of the entire class!  He is  3 all time in interceptions behind Krause and Tunnel and in front of Lane, all 3 of which are Hall of Famers.  The only other "live ball era" defensive back in the top 10 is Lott at  6.  As for Deion, he is   22    And if  3 in interceptions doesn't impress you then he is  1 in interception return yards,  1 in interception returns for TD, and  2 in non-offensive touchdowns.    Sharpe made 8 Pro Bowls and 4 All Pro teams.  That is fewer than each of the modern players selected.|`|39ixfEIraa	I MEAN HE WAS GOOD, BUT TONY G IS A BETTER TE

And yes, they're fans.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I do have to laugh there were a lot of obvious bandwagoners but, the Steelers didn't exactly trounce them. That's the best SB I've seen since the 1970's.

And that's all they did need.|`|GKH8n3xzaa	RELAX...|`|xDDNCKvlaa	Well to bad the Eagles couldn't get it done. And by the way, I'm not a bandwagon Cardinals fan.

I don't see how the Eagles could have made the game any better.  I can't remember a more exciting Super Bowl.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	I wish that it had been Philly. It would have been a better game on the whole.     It was a great last 5 minutes, but the previous 55 was choppy and slow. The Cardinals took the Steelers down to their level of play.     This was a fluke run by Arizona. They won't be back again anytime soon.|`|AA11749193	Okay, now. Go to bed and get some sleep. You've been watching too much commentary.

They looked great this year without Brady. If he is healthy and they fill some gaps in their injured defense? I hate the Pats, but they have to be up there. The Eagles have a chance every year. Hopefully we will be talking about Eli's second superbowl win this time next year.|`|wxXguyK3aa	There are a few possibilities:  Colts, Giants, Patriots, Cowboys, Steelers.|`|3BcvcJX9aa	Steelers again, if they can keep players from leaving in the offseason.  And from the NFC, I would go with Dallas.  If the team stays healthy, they are hard to beat.
El7C2JsMaa	It is a ridiculous decision i think everyone can agree with that, but as soon as it happened and the ref didn't take any action i knew nothing would happen because of this stupid rule that FIFA have come up with that stops the FA from taking any action if the officials witnessed the incident and didn't take any action at the time, its not the first time things like this have happened!   FIFA really need to get rid of this rule otherwise they are saying that refs can't ever make mistakes! And surely if the FA aren't allowed to reprimand a player after the game if the ref decided not to take any action at the time (as in Bosingwa's case) then why are they allowed to rescind a players red card because surely the ref took what action he felt appropriate at the time (rightly or wrongly) so if they followed the same rules in both cases then the FA shouldn't be able to change the ref's decision!   there one word that somes up FIFA/the FA... inconsistency!|`|gpNIG15eaa	The Bosingwa incident was uncalled for.Bosingwa should've been sent off,but Gerrard to deserved a red for two bookable offences - one for a late tackle on Kalou and the other for diving in the penalty area.And Lampard didn't even deserve a yellow for his 50-50 tackle on Alonso.  Still,Liverpool won the game,story over.If the Chelsea players felt wronged by the Lampard red card,they could've used it as an initiative and grown stronger.Instead,I was baffled to see no team spirit among the Chelsea players.  Even if Chelsea had 11 men on the pitch,there was no way they'd even snatch a point at Anfield as Liverpool dominated them from start to finish.Petr Cech was the real Man of the Match.Otherwise Liverpool could've scored more.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	The FA's inconsistency and frequent braindead decisions continue to surprise me. What a ridiculous decision.|`|p8lB73rdaa	Only to balance the Lampard **** up !|`|fEWhwumZaa	Ridiculous.  I also love how they call it a "high challenge"  Wtf..|`|cOPCNP7Laa	That is sad. Real sad.|`|RSJbqioUaa	It wasn't a challenge of any sort!  It was a kick...  I think my bribes for the high powered FA people have paid off..|`|Gr99OjQuaa	the red card on lampard was very very harsh. that should be overturned. bosingwa should be fined or suspended. that was a pathetic action on his part.     lampards card was harsh but the bosingwa incident deserves FA action, just my opinion.. im a united fan|`|PsCS0GK3aa	Impossible. They better not rescind that other red card then.|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I can't believe that! What, was the foot not high enough for the FA's liking?|`|Pfq2zRejaa	how ?|`|D7Dubtt9aa	Its disgusting the man even admited he did wrong. FA need to be more consistant the only thing they are consistant in is getting it wrong|`|AA12370193	I could care less, we had Adebyor watching from the stands for a few games for nothing while Lucas Leiva is still playing..  Refereeing and suspensions have been a big joke this season. Why get worked up about that now? The game is over, you won, big deal.    Ya but I'm saying just drop it. Bosingwa's escape from punishment should be a one off, we all know that. But the way I've been seeing decisions go this season there will soon be red cards for kicking a ball out for a corner while blatant elbows and headbutts escape punishment.    It is Nick, it honestly is. But when I see crap carry on for so long I just cant be bothered anymore..
AA11108627	I have a suggestion for you:    I would allow the kids to watch the Super Bowl itself.  But there is no need to watch the stupid commercials or the halftime show.    Instead, during these times tune into the "Puppy Bowl" on the Animal Planet channel!  It is a delightful program.  A bunch of puppies are let loose on this makeshift football field, and are allowed to play their own little "football" game.  Of course, they mostly just bite toy footballs and wrestle with each other, but it is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face!    Animal Planet has done this every year for the past 5 Super Bowls, and always broadcasts this program the exact same time as the Super Bowl.  So next year, make plans to tune in to "Puppy Bowl VI" during Super Bowl commercials.  It's good, clean, pure entertainment!    This is only available on Cable/Satellite TV.  Check your listings for what specific channel it is on.  If you don't have Cable, perhaps there is an alternative channel you can tune to or activity they can do during the commercials.  I believe Animal Planet has a Website you can check out for details.    Regardless, I think it would be good for the kids to watch the game itself, if only for social reasons.  Practically all the other kids would have seen the game, and the kids don't want to feel left out if everyone else is talking about it.    I encourage this not just for kids, but for anyone who considers these commercials to be offensive, stupid, or a waste of time.  Check it out next year!|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Not enough impact to make any difference. Kids 5 and 9 will forget about that totally when the next cartoon comes on.|`|GHusBLjgaa	That is up to their parents remember NBC pulled a Commercial by PETA for being to sexually explicit.|`|iL6UVfl4aa	I agree...  I can't believe some of these commercials.  I don't have kids but a step daughter and and was watching with her and 2 other kids.  I was like wow!!! I can't believe they show some of this stuff.  I remember growing up my parents turned off the commercials and they were nothing compared to now.    Even the dorritos commercercial, when they show a girl in lingerie.  And sadly enough I am sure they will get worse|`|AA11749193	It probably bothered you more than it did them. I've seen much worse/poor taste things in Prime Time TV. It's gr8 that you are trying to control what your kids are watching. Just can't control what odd and ridiculous things are going to be shown on TV.     Take care and have a gr8 week!|`|4t28hLrIaa	that's doesn't have to do anything with  the SuperBowl,ill let my children,let them be curious,anyways it doesn't even matter there are just stupid movie commercials,i think your being overprotective.not in a bad way  :)  anyways,im surprised your kids are interested on the superbowl,most kids ignore that stuff.|`|39ixfEIraa	ITS UNDERWEAR, ARE YOU NEVER GOING TO TAKE THEM SWIMMING?? SAME THING, AS A KID (IM ONLY 19) I SAW ALL THAT STUFF, BUT IT DIDNT MAKE ME A WORSE PERSON....YEA I DONT AGREE WITH NUDITY ON TV, BUT WITH THIS SOCIETY WHAT DOES IT MATTER ANYMORE??  PS CARDS WERE SCREWED|`|hXO28qIcaa	i would just let them watch everything but the commercials|`|a6EndAPiaa	This debate has been going on for years.  Yes there is much more sex and violence on TV than there was when you grew up (and even more since I grew up LOL).  Yes that commercial was a little too adult in my mind.    There is no getting away from that kind of thing.  If you are going to let your kids watch commercial TV at any time you are going to see those kinds of things.    If you want to avoid that your only choice is to never let your kids watch commercials.  I completely respect your decision if you choose not to subject your kids to that kind of thing; however, it is nearly impossible to shelter them from it.    My best advice is when you see something like that is judge your kids reactions.  Did they really see that as something overtly sexy?  If they did then talk to them about it and why you think that kind of behavior is wrong.  If (as I suspect) they did not grasp the sexual innuendo then just ignore it because if you make a big deal out of it then they will to.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Well, Pittsburgh area public schools were on a 2 hour delay today so I assume they expected children to watch the game. Then I saw some of the commercials and thought it was in very poor taste. Remember the great Janet Jackson boob show at half time?|`|ePWCTwl6aa	Let them watch what they like.  Can shadow 'em forever.|`|FxAD44Moaa	well YOU were the one in charge of what they were watching, right?        so,   conclude your analysis through this.    i'm assuming you're the parent?

C4KFUBLDaa	I'm old enough to have been watching WTAE news when Myron Cope was doing his weekly Sport Commentary when he FIRST came up with plea for Pittsburgher's to go to their linen closets and pull out any yellow or black towel and bring it to the next game and wave it to put a hex on the visiting team.  The Steelers were in somewhat of a slump and needed some form of excitement to create momentum.  When Cope first spoke of the Terrible Towel, you could almost see the spit spewing when he over pronounced the T's- in typical Cope form.  I remember laughing at the idea at first and it slowly built momentum.  If you look at video from SB X!V, Steelers/LA Rams you only see a spattering of towels in the stands.  Today every Steelers fan, young and old, owns at least one.    Your second question is that today any towel produced with Cope's licensing is a TT- and all proceeds go to a charity-a home for autistic and mentally challenged-where Cope's son resides.  But, at first they were hand made towels or just towels from home that we waved before Cope realized he was really on to something.    We love Cope as much as we love the Steelers!|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Long time Steeler announcer, Myron Cope, coined the term. Myron was known for his turns of a phrase. That one caught on.    Official Terrible Towels are gold with Black writing. And, for those who don't know, all the royalties from the sale of Terrible Towels have always and will always go to a local school for special needs children. That school is set up for life thanks to Myron's generosity.|`|dfo8gSaraa	It was a marketing name that the late Myron Cope came up with.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrible_To...|`|utBFEjAzaa	cause it wasn't made with Bounty material
bQCUYTpmaa	Buy    Punching small animals, riding sea lions in the oceans, screaming and crying...    One of the few bright spots for Super Bowl comercials yesterday...

8RNPlSAfaa	so where's the margaritas??    You know you're starting to pi$$ me off..|`|q8mbICQ8aa	No one. God couldn't even help him in the superbowl, he isn't great at all. Hopefully he retires so we can get Leinart in there.|`|M41jJp0Laa	I would not be surprised to see the Cardinals resign him to a 2 year deal.    --------------------------    This question implies that Kurt Warner is not a Hall of Fame quarterback when it is clear that he is.    As a matter of fact, his career stats are nearly identical to Tom Brady's.    Kurt Warner: 109 games, 2327/3557 (65.4% comp.), 28,591 yards, 182 TDs, 85 INTs, 93.8 QB rating    Tom Brady: 113 games, 2301/3653 ( 63% comp.), 26,446 yards, 197 TDs, 91 INTs, 92.9 QB rating|`|gnRiLwSxaa	Do you think that Arizona did not get their money's worth out of Warner this year?    He came within a lucky catch and about 30 seconds of winning the Super Bowl.    They also might have won if someone could tackle at the end of the first half.    What do people like you want from a player?|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	4 picks per game on average? Sounds like an insane exaggeration.    The guy is right at the top of the list in terms passer rating. You can't maintain that with a lot of picks. All QB's that throw around 40 passes per game are going to have picks. Didn't Manning have like a 5 pick game against SD this year or last?|`|AA11105507	I'm sure the New Jersey Jets will be looking for a veteran QB.|`|3BcvcJX9aa	Detroit would be a good match.  They have one good receiver, and the  1 pick in the draft.  They have plenty of room under the cap to pick up other players also.  They could be a winning team again soon.|`|keXaF4Puaa	Hey the guy got em to the big game. Sh*t happens. It was'nt God's fault the guy screwed up|`|dfo8gSaraa	Arizona.  He'd be better served there than to start over someplace else.    But, they're probably gonna lose their Offensive coordinator and Boldin too.
616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	To my knowledge is is illegal for another offensive player to assist a team mate over the goal line. The TD last night was over-turned anyway on other grounds.    I remember the Fridge was penalised for trying to help Payton over the goal line once.    I could only find reference to the NCAA rule:  The NCAA rule officially states "no player of the team shall grasp, push, lift or charge into the runner to assist him in forward progress." It's a five yard penalty.     Of course this penalty is hard to enforce when everyone is trying to push the pile, but that pull in the SB was pretty blatant.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Yes, it is allowed. But I'm surprised they didn't review that one like they reviewed every single other call in the whole game.|`|809245c84f901f4623e72189b3866e79aa	If the ball crosses the gaol line before the carrier is deemed down it is legal.   Pushing or Pulling the player is allowed|`|i5MInqeMaa	It is allowed.  If you watch a lot of goal line plays almost all the time the o-line ends up pushing the running back into the endzone if he is being upheld right at the goal line.
gt0NtM8taa	the is a reply to monkey;s response saying it would take a miracle for the cards to win. and at the end you said "no dice" implying that they didn't have a prayer. let me ask you what about boston college defeating miami in 1984. The eagles took possession of the ball at their own 22 yard line with 28 seconds left. And well I SHOULDN'T have to tell you what happened. And if that is too far in the past for you. Let me remind you of "The Music City Miracle." January 8th, 2000 the Bills take the lead 16-15 with only 16 seconds on the clock. And what happened??? The Titans returned the kick to win that wildcard playoff game. And of course we all remember "The Play." Let me remind you in case you forgot about Stanford taking the lead over Cal 20-19 with only 4 seconds left. Who won that game? I do believe im my memory serves me that Cal returned that kick to win.    So if you are looking for a miracle its possible. Lets take a look back if that play is ruled an incomplete pass. Warner snapped it from pit 44. The ball hits the ground with 8 seconds on the clock. We have an unsportmanlike conduct penalty (sorry don't recall who it was on) for taking his helmet off on the field. So now Warner has the ball on the 29 with no time outs and 8 seconds on the clock. Do not forget the clock stops due to an incomplete pass. So it was possible for the  Cards to win that game.    As for you having every Cards' reciever triple covered (yes I understand its an exsageration) this would mean you wouldn't rush anyone? Giving Warner all the time in the world...literally? Maybe you rush 3 or 4 (your best bet)? Lets say you rush 3 thus meaning 8 drop back into coverage. So you have 8 guys covering Boldin, Fitzgerald, Breaston, James, and probally Arrington (or possibly Hightower). So now who do you "triple cover"? Or maybe you get smart and run that prevent defense we saw earlier (which worked wonders...ha)? So you have one back cover all 5 recievers thus leaving you 3. So now do you double Bolding, Fitzgerald, and Breaston and leave James and whoever else it one on one? Or just double cover Boldin and Fitzgerald and keep a safety back? Well what I am getting at is that you tried that with about 5 minutes in the game and Arizona gashed you. As you saw with Fitzgerald's 64 yard touchdown. On that play the Steelers rushed 4 dropping 7 into coverage. Not to mention James didnt get past the line of schrimage so the Cards only had 4 recievers to the Steelers 7 defensive backs (including the 2  safetys) thus meaning you had 5 backs covering 4 recievers with 2 safetys over the top and they STILL beat you. So you double cover Fitzgerald. Kinda like you tried to up 20-7 and he beat you? And on that drive you had Fitzgerald double covered and had TWO safetys back and he still picked up a good chunk of yards. So as for you saying that Arizona had no chance is just commical. I think you are getting a little to confident in the Steelers' defense and way too cocky.    But to answer your question Terry is by far blinder then Mr. Wonder. But I also found the refs to be power hungry and there was way too much laundry on the field.|`|nYI8iNjsaa	Terry|`|vXFpzKRaaa	The jury's still out on this one...    The bad thing is Terry still thinks he can see while Stevie at least has accepted the fact that he is blind.|`|i5MInqeMaa	How about kurt warner not throw an interception for a tD. LMFAO|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Bill Levy, the one that handed them the Seattle one was WORSE!  He was blind an someone stole the kane!    One good thing that has come out of this, MILLIONS of people are starting to realize how Pittsburgh has won these last 2 championships.  When your on the world stage an your seeing it first hand, your credibility as a champion is highly damaged.  It will get passed down from generation to generation. Ill be tellin my nephew about them getting handed 2 titles. Ill also make sure he knows about the steroid use on their team in the 70s.  Pittsburgh fans will now be trying to defend themselves for years about this.  The Niners and Dallas earned all theirs fair and square    http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdow...|`|3LQ4Dm0uaa	Stevie Wonder.    Steelers won that game.  They outplayed the other team at the end.  They deserve the win.  Should the last play have been reviewed, absolutely...but that still means it would literally take a miracle for them to win.  They would have had 7 seconds left and the ball on the 30.  Each receiver would have been triple teamed in the endzone.  No dice.|`|Lb811SzCaa	LOL. This is a rhetorical question right? Everybody knows after yesterday that Stevie Wonder could have called a better game by himself than Terry's entire crew. Stevie could have been Ref, Umpire, Back Judge etc..and could have called as good a game.|`|dfo8gSaraa	Stevie Wonder.    McAulay wasn't blind when he overturned Ben's touchdown was he?    Can't have it both ways skippy.
Lb811SzCaa	They will in fact review them. They review every call in every game made by the officials. However, they can't change the calls now (obviously). Yeah, I get your point. Pretty lousy officiating last night.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	The NFL employs someone to go through every game and check every call made so that they can keep track of how refs are doing. Unfortunately it's probably kept secret and it'll be way after the fact. People should be happy to know that NFL refs get about 99.6% of their calls right.|`|AA10184408	Yeah that would be great! The game was great but the officiating was not good at all. The refs blew 2 calls that were overturned causing the Cards to use 2 challenges on what were easy calls to make on the field, leaving them with only one challenge that was not used to review whether Warner's arm was coming forward or not at the end.... bizarre.|`|wMh38OzVaa	Will you Stupid Cards. fans give it a rest.You're just as big a bunch of losers as your idiot team.shut up and quit crying like babies.WIMPS!!!|`|AA11108627	Sorry, you can make a case that every game is flawed.  There is no way that absolutely every deserved penalty will be called, every spot of the football is accurate, every catch is a completion.  Demanding a review of every play would be an exasperating experience for fan, player & coach alike.  It just isn't practical, and in most cases isn't necessary.    Remember, the vast majority of years in the NFL there were no reviews at all.  The refs didn't have the luxury of instant replay to evaluate their decisions, and what they concluded was final, even if they were completely wrong.    Just be glad that in the past few years, something has being done to attempt to correct the most obvious missed calls.  But the system will never be perfect, and eventually every team will be snubbed.  No team is immune.  It's just part of the game, and the best teams simply have to accept that, and do their best to win in spite of this.    If you think last night's game was "flawed", you're not alone.  I'm sure the players on both teams would agree with you.  But I'm also sure that the players believe that it happens every game.  Everyone does their best, mistakes happen, and sometimes you just have to let it go.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Good lord, there are too many reviews as it is.    And the whiners still complain about the reviewed calls which are upheld. So having more wouldn't settle anything.|`|bwYVs2k9aa	YES i wish that were the case it seems officials had a lighter hand towards the steelers thats for sure. too bad we cant know for sure|`|3BcvcJX9aa	The Steelers won, and deserved to win.  They outplayed the Cards when they needed to, and that is final.  The game takes long enough as it is, and nobody wants to sit for 5 hours and watch a bunch of instant replays.|`|KhBmlaefaa	No. You can never make the losing side happy. They will always find something to beach about.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I honestly think that the NFL is stirring up controversy, so the games can stay interesting to all the fan bases. They know because of more female fans, they need more than just the game. So they create much drama and put up with as much as they can. This keeps the fans happy, and gives them something to talk about. Its a win-win for them.
Lb811SzCaa	Yes and no. Troy's last season there was 2002. Matt was redshirted in 2001 and was a redshirt freshman in 2002. So they were teammates, but did not really play in any games together. Carson Palmer was qb when Troy played at USC.|`|U7ECGZmqaa	They r not in USC.  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with|`|Qx8U9JR2aa	Yep.

eDCyle05aa	The Pittsburgh Steelers, Chuck Noll, Bill Cowher, and Mike Tomlin each one at least one Super Bowl since the first Super Bowl in 1967.    EDIT: Since the very first super bowl, every coach the steelers have had, has won a super bowl!! The coaches before that could not have won a super bowl, so any coaches before that would not be counted since the question was about the super bowl. So, clearly the guy asking the question was reffering to the "Super Bowl Era".|`|dfo8gSaraa	None.    The NFL has been around over 75 years.  The Super Bowl has been around only 43.    The Steelers have been around since 1933 and had several losing seasons BEFORE Chuck Noll.|`|a6EndAPiaa	At one point you could have said The Cowboys (Landry, Johnson, Switzer) but today the answer is none.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	None.    You could ask which franchise has had every one of its coaches in the past 40 years win at least on Super Bowl title.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	None Zero
vXFpzKRaaa	They did beat themselves.  I don't know what they were thinking but their game breaking WR should of touched the ball more.  Not only that, they seemed to be dropping a lot of passes as if the Steelers defense needed help from them to win.  And how come they didn't go back to the "no huddle" offense that was so effective Warner hit Fitz for the TD.  If the Cardinals would of executed better and would of came in with a better game plan, this could very well have been the Cinderella story some of us were expecting.  They definitely beat themselves and this was a winnable game.|`|q8mbICQ8aa	Same here, plus Matt Leinart should have been in for most of the 4th quarter because me and my friend Dooley, agree he chokes under pressure|`|126986d456c7650b3fab46b5cfe905a1aa	No and I'll tell you what...the Cardinals would have been blown out trying to force the ball to Fitzgerald early. Kurt, threw the ball where it was open, usually to Boldin. The Steelers had seen what Fitzgerald had been doing all postseason, and had him clamped down in the first 3 quarters. But the key is Arizona was still moving the ball. If it wasn't for a misread that led to that amazing touchdown on an interception, Arizona would have been up at halftime tied, or with the lead, without Fitzgerald catching a single pass.    So no. On the other hand, at the end of the game Arizona was up 3. Their defense needed to step up and play like they had been playing all day. Good tough defense. At the 2 minute warning, 3rd and 6 or something, Arizona's D played conservative and gave up a big play. There's nothing Fitzgerald or the offense could do about it.     Arizona's defense held them 3 times to a Field Goal in the red zone (4 times if you include that time they had to stop them twice in the same drive, because a penalty gave Pitt a fresh set of downs after they had already made the field goal).     Arizona played out of their minds, and I'm so happy they didn't just roll over and play dead, even when they were down by 10 and their first 2nd half drive stalled. They never quit, they kept playing, and in the end they had a chance. But their defense played conservative, and gave up the TD that decided the game. If any decision is to be questioned, it's why did they decide to play conservative on the last drive?    Of course that last play, I thought should've been reviewed as well, but I don't want to take away from the tremendous job both teams did, in putting on one of the best Super Bowls in recent memory. Congratulations to both teams what an awesome way to end what was a very strange season.|`|AA12370001	they would simply have won if they would have tackled Harrison who ran 100 yards for a TD!|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Nope. When you have that human turnover machine Warner make too many dropbacks he would have been picked more and fumbled more.|`|3BcvcJX9aa	No, the Steelers would have adjusted just like they did all year.  AZ played a great game, but the best team won in the end.|`|dfo8gSaraa	No. Fitz was shut down until the 4th qtr.    Arizona had their chances, especially since the Steelers gave up their 13 point lead.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	That's highly possible. However, we could go on forever with "what if" scenarios. Your suggestion and its outcome are very valid.|`|W6RDn13oaa	yea they did|`|39ixfEIraa	THAT DUDE SAY KURT WAS A HUMAN TURNOVER MACHINE??? GIVE HIM SOME DAMN TIME, FAT *** OLINE CANT BLOCK A FUCKEN POTATO CHIP, BUT IF NOT FOR THE BAD PLAY CALL BEFOR THE HALF CARDS WOULD HAVE EASILY WON...O NOT TO MENTION THE SCREW JOB THE REFS GAVE|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I still say the Steelers defense would have won game even without the interception for a td|`|AA10184408	No, the Cards had to work a scheme that would free Fitz up a little more. They had him doubled up all 1st half. The whole game came down to a once in a million type play resulting in a 100 yd. pick 6. Amazing catches are a full time part of the NFL but returning an interception for a 100 yd. score that makes the difference in a Super Bowl.... thats special! If that play ended any other way than a score, the Cards win.  Another big question that will be talked about forever is Warners last pass... was his arm coming forward? why did it not get reviewed? What a game! Great question
3BcvcJX9aa	I just answered a question like this.  If they can stay healthy, they are hard to beat.  I say that they will play Pitt in the Super Bowl.|`|keXaF4Puaa	Probably as a wild card playoff team.Provided everyone can play nice together and Romo can get Jessica as an offensive lineman or lose 100 pounds which ever comes first.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	Have you seen their schedule for next year? The only wins I see on their schedule are the raiders and the chiefs. 2-14 is your outlook, with lots of crying and fighting between your players.|`|PRGNC4Bzaa	dead last in the nfc east their weak coaching and low life players like TO have no chance of doing well|`|Vrh20F6taa	I predict the Cowboys to go to the Super Bowl and play the Pittsburgh Steelers in what will be the greatest super bowl ever and most watched.  Oh and Cowboys will win...|`|Lb811SzCaa	Giants fan here. FYI    Cowboys scare me, but they have for several years now and nothing comes of it.  In 5-10 years we will be talking about Jerry Jones in the same ilk that we speak of Al Davis right now. Jerry needs to get the hell out of the day to day operations. He was okay at it once (just like Al Davis was years ago) but it is time as he gets older to get out of the way. It is easier to find talented players than it is to know which talented players fit in which places together as a dynamic team unit. Jerry still does not get that concept. He only looks at the talent not at how the player also fits in with his other players and in the locker room etc... Until you have a cohesive team playing together you are in trouble. Look at the Giants. They have very little talent compared to the Cowboys, but they epitomize team (except for that clown Burress). Anyway, Dallas either makes or just misses the playoffs, maybe wins first round and then goes home in Divisional round (at best). Sorry.|`|GHusBLjgaa	Depends on what happens in the draft, free agency, and as we saw this season how many injuries occur in the regular season.      That said some things they should do would include trading TO for anything even a 5th round pick. We got Roy Williams, Crayton has improved big time, Austin is a good slot reciever and we got two good recieving TE's in Bennet and the man Witten. Get him out he is a distraction, then use the available cap room to sign some pass rushers to help out the secondary. Juluis Peppers said he wants to try playing in a 3-4. Can you imagine him and Ware lining up on the line. That would be insane.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	They have decent team but need a better coach but even if they do make play offs, they will do what they always do, lose, sorry but it's what they have been doing foe awhile since they can't win in the play offs & that's been going on since 1996, last play off win & Cowboys hate to hear that but it's just a fact they have to learn to accept|`|XwQxKwRcaa	They will get a ton of hype, Romo will be the best September QB in history, then they will finish 10-6 and lose in the first round to some nondescript team.     Wade Phillips is a marshmellow with a headset.|`|lMT8btn8aa	I think that if the Cowboys can sure up their secondary and work in all 3 of their running backs into the gameplan, then they will be very tough to beat. I admit that I am a fan, but I am trying to be as objective as possible. I see them finishing 12-4 and advancing to the NFC championship game.|`|aCCUQQu4aa	The Cowboys WILL...GO...ALL..THE...WAY!!!!!!    Go Cowboys    They will do much better if they can keep their QB healthy for the whole season.|`|AA11105507	Colts will win the Superbowl.  Remember back when Dungy left the TB Bucs...the next year, they won the Superbowl.  Now that he has left Indy, the Colts win the next Superbowl.  That doesn't mean Dungy is a bad coach...he's a great coach.  He built a great team here in Indy.  A new coach is going to build on and improve what Dungy has established.      As for your Cowboys, I think they'll miss out on the playoffs again next season.  I think Wade Phillips is a lousy coach.  He takes over teams that were built up by great coaches, and over the course of a few years, runs those teams into the ground.  He did the same thing when he took over coaching the Buffalo Bills from Marv Levy, and now he's doing the same thing with the Cowboys.

Lb811SzCaa	Charles Haley has the distinction of being the only player in NFL history to have been on five Super Bowl-winning teams. To date, no other player has surpassed this achievement. Playing for the San Francisco 49ers from 19861991, he won a ring from Super Bowl XXIII and XXIV following the 1988 and 1989 seasons, respectively. After having a falling out with then 49ers head coach George Seifert and a physical confrontation with then quarterback Steve Young, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in the 1992 off-season. With the Cowboys, he won three more Super Bowl rings over the next four seasons in 1992 (Super Bowl XXVII), 1993 (XXVIII), and 1995 (XXX).|`|DvGRLBxGaa	Its Charles Haley|`|a6EndAPiaa	Charles Haley has 5 rings 2 with the 49ers and 3 with the Cowboys.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	I think its charles Haley|`|eDCyle05aa	Charles Haley has the most, he won five Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers.

Zg8s0Ma9aa	As a high school basketball coach myself, that is based entirely up to the school board. My contract is a one year deal. Coaches are coaches, whether you coach high school or in the NBA and if your team is not performing the way it should you can be fired for that, but on the flip side the main purpose of a high school coach is to use basketball to teach life lessons. Not all coaches embrace this and try to win at all costs. Winning should be secondary to an education the "STUDENT-ATHLETE" will receive and that athlete should use what they learn on the court to help them in the "real world". Problem solving, teamwork, respect to those in authority(referees and coaches), etc.

4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I think they're already doing that. The wrestling in the PG era can be better of what we've seen. A large part of gimmicks seem to be enjoyed by kids and the older fans seem to what to see a lot more wrestling coming from the superstars.

BX0muv3raa	People who use stats solely to judge a player have nothing to offer a basketball discussion other than "yah, I googled so and sos stats so I know about him" and it painfully shows alot. A bunch of youngsters who don't know Julius Erving from Orange Julius. Anywhoo...    This isn't even close. This shouldn't even be debated. Comparing a guy with three good seasons to the NBA All Time leader in steals and assists is like comparing an American Idol winner to Michael Jackson's total record sales. You really, truthfully can't. Chris Paul doesn't belong in this conversation. At All. Not for a few more years. But for those who don't know...    When considering Stockton you must know that the man engineered the pick and roll and give and go that is a staple in every offense today. He, with Karl Malone laid the blueprint for the Big-man little man dynamic that makes pgs like Paul lots of money today. Nash to Stoudemire or in this case Paul to Chandler wouldn't be so prevalent in todays game had Stockton never put on those short shorts. Plus he was a better passer than Paul and about the surest thing from  the stripe and his three point range (when the line was further back for manly men) was as accurate as Larry Bird's.  He was never a scoring machine because he didn't have to be. He deferred to Malone, and when teams did manage to take the Mailman out of the equation you can be assured Mr. Stockton made them pay. I remember an old game that gets play on EClassic where the Lakers played the Jazz and 6'9 Magic Johnson deed up on Stockton and Stockton outplayed Magic to the tune of 36 points (4 of 6 from 3 pt range ) and 17 dimes! With a 6'9 agile Magic defending him! Chris Paul doesn't have that kind of command of his game. Imagine if Shawn Marion or LBJ stuck him an entire game, he ain't sniffing his usual numbers, that's for sure. Paul can't shoot as well as Stockton could. He can't pass as well either. Very close, but Stockton was the greatest passer who ever lived. Oh yah, he was also the greatest thief ever too, being the career leader in steals. Look at the stat's, but most importantly, look at the tapes.     I think I can safely say Stockton was better at everything than Paul sans driving to the basket.  Stockton and it ain't even close.     A better comparison would be Paul or Tiny Archibald, Paul or Gary Payton or Paul or Jason Kidd and I don't think he could stack up against either in their primes. He's had three good seasons. Give it some time, but right now CP3 ain't in the conversation in regards to great PGs.|`|4yiH5TiQaa	John Stockton will always be better than Chris Paul. Deron Williams is the next John Stockton, or better.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	I'd take Stockton for 2 reasons.    1. Paul right now is dealing with an injury.  2. We're still at least a couple seasons away from Paul entering his prime.    If you're asking me to compare Stockton in his prime to what I expect Paul to do in his prime, I'd take Paul in a heartbeat.|`|1238d8d31da2946a8a5f08dd1fdb4bcbaa	Chris Paul|`|RvI1gGbDaa	I'd pick CP3 because he's a more aggressive scorer than Stockton.|`|1TgIuZMqaa	STOCKTON...no doubt in my mind    Stockton could probably have scored more...but he had Malone doin all that|`|pl2SocVKaa	stockton because he had more assists paul is the better scorer but stockton created more so for that reason solely stockton|`|UMVWQiYJaa	Stockton|`|Yw1hoH05aa	John Stockton was much better than Chris Paul ever will be|`|pNzlwHkOaa	Whoever said Paul is dumb... Id take stockton anyday... CP3's assists mostly come off of lobs to chandler, which is something any PG can do if they have an explosive enough big man willing to just go for oops all day....    Stockton was a better defender, and a much better shooter...|`|zchKmkqsaa	Chris Paul is a much more agresive scorer, but is that the main role of a point guard?  Stockton was a better shooter, but he didn't take as many, or drive the lane as much as Chris Paul.  John Stockton passed the ball more percisely than anyone in the league ever has or will.  And he could steel the ball like it was nothing.  John Stockton was not as athletic, but he made up for that with skill and basketball IQ.  Stockton was the best pure point guard the league has ever seen, and I'd be surprised to ever see a better one.
6STKRenhaa	in a 3-4 defense, nose tackle is most important, however bj raji is a bit of a reach at their pick so the broncos should either choose melunga or mereno. no way aaron curry falls this far. he is the best player in the draft tied with crabtree.|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Curry, but he isnt going to last that long and so wont raji, so malunga because they need a solid backup to dj williams

bLWHR4fOaa	Defense. Defense. Defense.  The Broncos can score points with the best of them and when their offense is clicking they are a tough team to beat. However it's the defense that really needs work.  ESPN's Todd McShay has Denver picking Rey Maualuga from USC. I like this pick cause it would give Denver a good solid run stopping ILB. And in a division with Tomlinson, Larry Johnson, and Oakland's stable of solid RBs, stopping the run is key.  Go Broncos!|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	malunga|`|KTp27Fokaa	Two glaring holes are at inside linebacker and defensive tackle.    That would leave either Ray Maualuga (sp?) or B.J. Raji to draft.

I would be really pissed if they drafted Moreno or Wells, they need defense!|`|BH05gFobaa	noshawn moreno|`|mbqAQAJ7aa	they should definately draft defense.  there offense is really good but there defense sucks lol.|`|q6NGxNR3aa	DT BJ RAJI their d needs to be upgraded badly

Practice shooting off the dribble, practice fading away, practice all different types of shots that you may get in game situations.    Wishing you nothing but net,    Dodge Taylor

End of story. lol.|`|qyHApgV1aa	Ayy Man.  Im A Chick, & im all for NBA.  I love it, & WNBA.  But i must admit NBA is a bit more intense :)|`|8d03fcb2a7fe3a4e9c78ebd702581c44aa	well i know a couple that are fans but none taht really is a BIG fan|`|aQAs63SLaa	yeh my gf likes the nba, thats how we hit it off when we first met, talked about the nba and got to know each other because of that, shes a knicks fan which isnt great but understandable because we live in nyc, im a cavs and lebron fan so the only way this would be a problem is if she was a lakers fan or thought kobe was better than lebron, thankfully she doesnt like the lakers, and she thinks lebron is better than kobe which makes me happy, i could never date a kobe/laker fan,     out of my group of friends some of them think kobe is better and that makes me like them less, lucky theyre not laker fans, if they thought kobe was the best AND they were laker fans which would mean id have to look at them wearing their laker jerseys...that would be a problem, but right now those friends are borderline for me|`|I8sf2m89aa	you are saying that you are an idiot,just to be different.thats very smart!you have no friends except these losers on yahoo/answers.that sorta makes you ,a loser......ppppphhhhhhhRRRRRTTTTT|`|qh51Bkfyaa	me haha i think im one of the only girls in my school that does.  but theres alot of guys where i go that watch it   :]|`|uxregJ0faa	unfortunately no :(    and yea im detecting some loss of brain cells :p    edit: the guys you know are weird.

Vp3RrTpeaa	Here is his e-mail: Theking@yahoo.com, you can e-mail him after the game.    Correct he should think about his team instead of the record because the game is close.|`|uxregJ0faa	Leave Lebron alone he has good stats today. He is not better than Kobe but he had a nice performance      Kobe will have that record for awhile, On the other hand Kobe had a good clutch game against Raptors. Win Win for everyone today|`|EKF2HdZKaa	yeah i think he is gonna try to stop.......  who cares,he already got better stats than kobe...|`|xt00f5Qoaa	You are just saying that because you are a Kobe fan boy.    Lebron is so much better than Kobe in stats this year      now wait and watch all the other Kobe Fan boys give this answer a thumbs down because they know i am right.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	what's your point man?    you're not his coach!    just sit down and watch the game!
6VZsiHJeaa	Yes, you will get better individually, but just not at team playing and stuff like that. You don't actually need to play with someone to get better at ball handling...you can practice drills and crossovers and stuff. You can also improve your shot.|`|ARVuep1waa	might be better of u play WITH someone because you'll need a defender to get better at ball handling. shooting you may want a defender to so you can figure out how to shot over people!!!    good luck|`|eZCCSMykaa	i think playing with people will get you better at games  and with yourself youll get your shot better and stuff.|`|APqwrrpDaa	just try individual skill training like dribbling then do partner stuff like shooting drills.|`|56Mb4BXIaa	jordan only practices alone in commercials....in real life he obviously practices against an opponent .
QxudUbGvaa	You could be a midget and play basketball... its all about your skill.. being tall is like an easy way out for ball players like kobe, lebron or jordan...its just an add on. practice practice practice. Just cuz your short dont mean nothing.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	You can't be 78 cm, if you were you'd be about 2 1/2 feet tall lol. If you say you're about 5'9", I'd say you were 175.26 cm.    Anyways, I wouldn't let height get you down. I've played against some very very good players that were 6'0" and shorter. If it makes you feel any better, I wish I was shorter. I'm 6'4" and I'm always forced to play center when I'm more of a SF.     Being tall helps to a degree, but it's not a necessity. Just work on your skills and you'll be fine.|`|Jsvz996Baa	i play basketball im 16 and im shorter than most of the girls on the basketball team. im like 5"5.i not that good @ math so i don't know your height|`|ZdNSSm0waa	Look at nate robinson, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues. they were the same height or shorter than you and look where they are now!

XrCc85kNaa	I dont think Lebron is trying to be like Kobe...  It is only his fans who try to compare him to Kobe...|`|uxregJ0faa	First of its his fans that are trying to instigate things. Lebron has said like 3 times Kobe is better than him and at least he had the DECENCY to admit that since his fans wont.    Lebron is still the second best player behind Kobe in the league so don't hate on Lebron neither|`|EKF2HdZKaa	1. Lebron knows kobe is the best,its only natural he will try to beat kobes score (since they are rivals),still hes already got 10 assists......    2. Who knows,the fans and media could be such a pain,instead of enjoying a good game we have to compare them.....    3. Kobe has haters,Lebron has haters....  --------------------------------------...  Cmon Carmelo,not all fans think lebron is better than kobe.....yet|`|lMDy8W0Raa	Because he is a wannabe. Lejoke is pathetic.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	I dont think he is trying to.  Well he that's what he said.

Italy will be stripped of the title when the facts come out!!!! He said something like     "go back to Africa, you don't belong to Europe". Very few people know that Zidane has African     background but he has! He responded spontenously without thinking of the consequences because he     is NOT used to receiving racial slurrs.... he really looks white!     The Italian goalkeeper actually said something to that effect to Thierry Henry PRIOR to this     incident (holding Henry around the shoulder to make sure he hears), but Henry just replied "****     YOU!" without taking any physical action. Henry is noticably black so he is used to this as a     professional player, and he responded appropriately.    Notice that when the Zidane case happened it was the Italian goalkeeper who allerted the referee.     This tells you it was a pre-planned and pre-meditated phsycological and racial tactics that the     Italians used against the French to expell a French player and consequently win this     Championship. FIFA is fighting a fierce battle right now against racism in football so I'm     absolutely convinced that when the facts come out, Italy will be stripped of the title!    Finally, this should be a lesson to African players. If they ever want to win this cup they     should be prepared to receive racial slurrs on the field without taking physical action.

There will always be days that you complain to your coaches and other athletes about how hard the workouts are. And on the days of track meets, you're gonna have butterflies in your stomachs and sometimes chicken out before the race. But those butterflies will just make you run faster because of the adrenaline rush you have in yourself. During tryouts and the first few practices, it may seem very hard. Most of the time, coaches try to scare the weaker kids out of the tryouts. Coaches are looking for those who are determined and never give up, and never NEVER walk. Jog slowing if you have to, but never walk! That shows your weakness. You'll have fun. Just sing a song in your head if you get tired and forget about the pain...IT depends what kind of runner you are, too. Do you sprint fast, or like to run for a long time? You'll find out during tryouts. Good luck!|`|c231783a7eaa651acfe00a52bf4c1720aa	if you like it enough then hard work will not matter to you. my friends did track and they said it was medium in how hard the sport was. the dropped out becuase they didn't like it. one of them decided to cheer with me. if you want to and set your mind to it. do it.|`|1b825261533d0da176973b5f5c67305faa	i dont know cause i played baseball, but at my school, everyone said that track sucked.

J1fxwkqraa	Hi Josiah,     I'm not sure if this is what you were referring to above, but depending on what level you're at, a good basketball shooting drill to work on your form and follow-through is the following:    * Set yourself up in a shooting position but instead of shooting forward at a hoop, shoot the ball up in the air.  * Aim to have the ball landing just in front of you and with proper form it should be spin back to you, you shouldn't have to go get it.  * Bend your knees, snap your wrist and follow through and the ball will land a few feet in front of you and spin back to you    This is great for working on your shooting motion and basic form/rhythm.    Any dribbling drills that you do will also help your shooting as they help you get a better "feel" for the ball.     Wishing you nothing but net,    Dodge Taylor|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	Dribble on the floor while lying on the side of your bed.

The only thing that I believe the lack, is the ability of the strikers, Mexico has to have a well planted defense.|`|2cc8e3ee3a1ca917c4f885f6716376acaa	theyshould be winning today|`|AA10052203	hell yeah mexico is winning!!! its the best|`|7ee034a35d894a4edfa32cba940b0f98aa	YES THEY WILL!!!!|`|3bb6d5a4382a8af64ea79e3896b44374aa	Hell YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10411874	mexico will win!!! they gonna win da cup too!!|`|e430c3158055785be3aa10304dee7fd9aa	Mexico should be able to win today.

In my opinion they will be not be successful in either game.|`|AA11500047	Most likely, yes.    What happens after is the big question.

8cbffd12d5290e0b2358de48d58dc53aaa	There are not many teams that could win from 5-0 down no matter how good they are. It would probably take at the bare minimum 20 minutes to score 5 goals so that would leave Brazil 70 minutes to score 6 goals. Yes, Brazil have some amazing players and they could score whenever they wanted against some weaker teams but any team in the world cup finals is pretty good and to score 5 goals in 20 minutes would mean they are a real threat. It would take some utter defensive catastrophe to concede 6 goals when you are on the verge on winning. Plus Brazil would have to commit bodies forward leaving huge gaps in defence against a team who had already scored 5 times against them?    Quite simply the answer is NO.|`|70eaa2b669fbc27a7bd57be3d188d0c9aa	yes for sure. with the quality that they have.well maybe the jerman suppoter think that the fisrt phase of the tournament seem like brazil are not good...but just to remind back...on 2002 in korea...they start the way and be the winner...|`|AA10522001	What makes you think Brazil will make the finals? They were striving for most of the match against the heroic Socceroos - a draw would have been a fairer result. Wait the next round you'll see Ronaldo mcdonaldo & co get thrashed|`|3f97738d0cf1c17c590ef01ee54c6132aa	If Luck is with Brazil so Brazil will win the World Cup|`|392fac156ea4e8f5535b3e4633d68736aa	no, impossible|`|ce2867fe36b571f2392a55396c06e2b0aa	Depends who they are playing against and how much time is left..so cant really jump to conclusions|`|d3585e4efe44ede8a00d75635a2750e8aa	yes why not|`|bd199987302a19abbb11b0a46d9b024daa	It depends who is on they have on the field, as reserves, how many subs. they have left, who they are playing, and how much time is left.  They may with suffiecient time, because it doesn't seem like they have really been trying that hard so far. If Ronaldo is out, as weird as this may sound, their odds are better. He just doesn't have it. His conditioning is terrible.|`|91c5fdfd8ecddf439b6b0e48c06303f5aa	they will|`|AA11673633	absolutely NO....    coz ENGLAND will beat them...|`|df93289825dfc28c98cf9b318dd4bc5aaa	why not?!|`|976d29535eb417416a2e21ba6bfa5288aa	In your dreams!   they can be so happy if they can make it to the semi finals! have you seen the match schedule yet?  but if they get the finals they are of course champion!    Wasn't it the best answer do you think?|`|a9da52ec0b3bb4a98fcd17396d96a322aa	no, they can't even score more then 2 goals against australia in 90 minutes, how can they do anything if they're 5-0 down?    They would probably over-commit their attack and conceed goals in defence if they tried.
AA11593515	No. Denmark's Peter Schmeichel almost did a few times in the 1998 WC, but that's only because they would use him to attack on corner and free kicks sometimes if they were behind.|`|AA10089351	this has happened more than once, penalties more often than not, I am not able to give the names though, sry.|`|d1b031867f6af7ba31d8f2d4f4f8bd44aa	in penalty kicks, yes|`|AA11519766	NO - this  absolutely has never happenend in a WORLD CUP level tournament with out the intervention of a fielder.

AA11757375	People compare solely because of two reasons:    (a) Wade grew up in Chicago, and for a good 13 years of his childhood, he watched MJ play game after game. To the extent that now, Wade can mimic famous Jordan-type shots.  (b) The numbers. The numbers for Wade and Jordan in their first 5 finals games are staggeringly similar to one another. Both of them also come up big down the stretch.|`|AA11606930	What a great question. I have no clue why they compare the two as far as I am concerned, there is not comparison|`|8f54a05d6edf8fdda7684751ac52e05caa	Because you need this type of marketing strategy to make the NBA finals more interesting..|`|AA12350088	there is only one Jordan|`|AA12037891	they are comparing him to MJ because of his ability to take over IMPORTANT games and put his team on his back.  I agree...wade is no MJ right now...but the way he wills his team to victory is very similar to the way MJ dominated.  nobody is saying wade is MJ....but there are similarities in the way they play.  he did the same thing at marquette when he got his team to the final four...he could not be stopped.  of course, this is only one playoff season and it's too early to say he is the next MJ.  but for this season at least, he sure is playing like MJ.|`|AA12206602	because he has the potential to be like michael jordan someday.|`|de2993b2b31071a5c20e582f9b6f6513aa	wade doesnt take over important games. all through game 5 he scored b/c the refs favor him and was able to get to the line. thats not takin it over that paying the refs. he some how only appears at certain times.

It was ridiculous; Argentina must have had at least 10 shots on goal, and NOT ONE OF THEM made it in.  Did the Dutch have a really small goal or were the 22 men out there just playing keep-away?  I haven't been that frustrated in a *really* long time.  I thought we should have won; the Dutch didn't get close enough to our goal most of the time, and yet...0-0.    This was one of those matches where I was afraid to take my eyes off the TV screen, in case something happened (like a goal).|`|AA12298079	It was great game even with out goals.

Ok, not really.  See you in the quarterfinals.
AA11500047	Disregard the above answers (except the first.)    The suffix "inho", in Portuguese, acts as a diminutive and diminutives are used as terms of endearment. Therefore, the nickname (most Brazilian players are known by a nickname, NOT their real names) Ronaldinho means "little Ronaldo", a nice way to call a superb player.    Incidentally, Johnny Serbia, the finesse you exhibited in your answer is about on a par with the quality of play of your namesake team ...    And, speaking of unpleasant names, ToT,  just ask someone what your pseudonym means in German. It so perfectly describes the condition of your brain!|`|AA11904638	I heard "inho" means little, for example Ronaldinho's name is Ronaldo but if u add "inho" it means "Little Ronaldo"  Get it? Cool.

It basically means "Junior" so Ronaldinho would mean Ronaldo jr.|`|6ea2714b659180badbdc29e516f18cfbaa	lineage|`|AA11261103	Because those are NOT their real names!!!!    They are usually their nicknames or first names.    For example,    Pele, Edson Arantes do Nascimento  Ronaldo, Ronaldo Lus Nazrio de Lima  Ronaldinho Gaucho, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira  Dunga, Carlos Caetano Bledorn Verri  Bebeto, Jos Roberto Gama de Oliveira|`|AA11462058	so they won't get confused with others that share their name, but came into the game before them.|`|66f7d16654ff94ccefd47a36ca5c5efaaa	That shows they are Brazilians, it's what make them different from the crowd.     It's for the same reason Croatia soccer players have names that end with 'ic' - for example, in Croatia they have such names as;  Simunic, Kovac, Modric, Simic, Klasnic, Olic, Seric etc.    In any country(except the in the US), there is always this similarity in prefixes and suffixes of peoples' names.|`|AA11414305	I think your have to ask their mother...it's unpleasant name|`|AA10625337	It's an affectionate diminutive form...like when you call someone "Mikey" instead of just "Mike".|`|424f94b15d807f1f09e4fcbf7bdb4305aa	You must ask their mothers|`|AA12298079	They have alot of last names after their parents and grandparents many generation on both sides of family so they made up or use one of the last names.

Arena - who had served US soccer very well - was horrible.  What made the '02 team so successful was the high-speed, run & gun style.  So we enter '06 in a 4-5-1 and play tentative and defensively from the get go.    Players weren't in their preferred positions.    Let's not even talk about motivation.    McBride was great.  Keller had two good games.  Convey & Dempsey were good for the most part.  Donovan, Reyna, and Beasley (his one great service aside) just didn't seem to be there in any of the games.|`|9c0fc104693430c9157aa10edd50c4a7aa	poor.. bruce arena in the first game did not act like a coach and in the italy game he did not use his advantages liek put in teh extra guy they had...all of these mistakes just affected the players and with a broken spirit they played ghana which was a hard adversary.|`|AA10520479	America should stick to baseball and American football and stop making attempts at playing soccer|`|AA11177436	Just makin up the numbers by the looks of their results,, you guys gotta get serious in this game if you ever want to be competitive on the world stage,, of football|`|AA12290095	not very good unfortunately    from a scale from 1 to 10 i'd say a 4|`|cb1bb2adf35cbbfa9d536a2df4a8de75aa	Poor.

I was listening to ESPN radio at work and one of thier own commentators was trash-talking soccer and saying junk like MLS & World Cup palyers are not as atheletic as MLB, NFL, or NBA players. It quite pissed me off, but he was talking out of his butt.

I think Germany's defence is not good enough after conceeding the two goals against Costa Rica, and, even though they haven't let any goals in since, this is their biggest team so far... Tevez, Messi, Crespo, Riquelme, Rodrigues, Saviola and Co. are too good.|`|53ae520e32a1a14a9b33d4e045b50736aa	I think Germany will win. Both are very strong teams but it's German territiory so they have played here many times before. Argentina is what I call: fast. But Germany is really strong in defence and are firm grounded.  I like both of them a lot but I would say Germany: at least they have an advantage with where they are playing.  Besides, I'm dutch, so I'm definitely going for my neighbor :)|`|163c2d80deb0d08a3497997e4fda8bbaaa	I think Germany will win.  Sweden should have been a much better challenge for Germany.  Argentina should have been able to whip Mexico soundly but I agree with others who have pointed out that Mexico made the game one of the best of the 2006 World Cup so far.  So combine that with Germany having the home field advantage and there it is.|`|3cce4c0ec20ee6ae0121590e2808ac88aa	i say argentina because they r really good and have won about 2 world cups but thats the exact same with germany,they won 2 world cups. and one last thing, it is the germans home and they'll get cheered on more so its a 50-50%|`|AA11286221	Germany.|`|b2b3bb17db501092df2b848b9cb510fbaa	Both teams had displayed very high performance as they usually do, they both had been champions of the world. Argentina have  better players but only a lil bit better, but being local counts a lot in the world cups. Being local gave the chance to England, France and Argentina itself to become champions of the world, another thing to have in mind is that players from Argentina are very tired after that amazing game against Mexico (best game in the cup so far in my opinion). So i say Germany is going to win but they will have to play with all they got.|`|61c924f73e59c98a125180ea6b3cbb73aa	i think its prolly gonna b germany bcuz first of all their both good teams prolly bout same level hard 2 tell but germany's gonna try harder cuz their playin on t heir place so they wanna win  more badly then argentina does and germany has bigger players dats a big advantage but u never know argentina has hot maneveurs also germany is very fast since they'r tall players they'r legs r bigger obviously so dat makes sense|`|bd0790dbce1a0a4e838efe3e0b414173aa	germany. this is their territory

AA10257166	Thats a good idea mate..... they use it in cricket,why not soccer.|`|AA11844717	because you can't stop the game to watch the video and then decide what it was  the game has to flow, even if a call is made    unlike cricket, soccer is continuous, and there are no pauses except half-time and such    referees do the best they can under the circumstances  they can't see everything  so they make decisions based on what they or the other referees CAN see  and they are the best of the best  no matter what anyone may say|`|AA11615156	nah, that wont be feasible at all. the pitch is too big for the thrid empire to be involve. and if u mean television replays like that of the rugby, it wont work as well. it maybe more fair to the teams, however, to stop and wait for the replays to be made and then the decision to be made will stop the flow of the momentum for the game. the only way to solve it, is to actually hire a group of professional referees and then trained them for the world cup. and these set of referees should follow a set of rules as to how harsh a foul shld be to dash out a card, and not as and when the referee feels he like...    i actually think that the referee for today's match for the spain vs france is quite good. he made the necessary actions thruout. not too harsh and not too lenient. and he doesn't make soccer look like a sissy game. the other referees? a small little tiny winny contact against a player, and that's a foul....wtf..|`|06de40a33d837d0e84220f685fc908a6aa	I bet you would be taking FOOTBALL seriously had Australia gone through, even with bad refereeing.

The best place to get them is at a Running Store because they employ real runners.  Joining a running club is also a great way to get started because you have other people supporting you.  Don't start out trying to run too much at first - maybe a mile then gradually work it up until you can run without walking.  That way you won't get discouraged or injured!  Enjoy!|`|AA11529758	I think you should go to a fitness center and ask trainers there whether you are into long distance running (800, 1500, and 3000 meters), short distance running (100, 200, and 400 meters), or Cross Country running (over 3 kilometers). you should then train 3-4 times per week at the fitness center or free jogging. there should be a balanced diet in your workout.

As pessoas  que tem mania de conspira??o.|`|cb46cbeace64cc165827ab197bfdc2f5aa	Talvez, isso explique a raz?o do Jogador Leonardo ter declarado a seguinte frase: "Se as pessoas soubessem o que aconteceu na Copa do Mundo,ficariam enojadas". Todos os brasileiros ficaram chocados e tristes por terem perdido a Copa do Mundo de futebol, na Fran?a. N?o deveriam.O que est exposto abaixo  a notcia em primeira m?o que est sendo investigada por rdios e jornais de todo o Brasil e alguns estrangeiros, mais especificamente Wall Street Journal of Americas e o Gazzeta delo Sport e deve sair na mdia em breve, assim que as provas forem colhidas e confirmarem os fatos. Fato comprovado: o Brasil VENDEU a copa do mundo para a Fifa. Os jogadores titulares brasileiros foram avisados, s 13:00 do dia 12 de Julho (dia do jogo final), em uma reuni?o envolvendo o Sr.Ricardo Teixeira (na nica vez que o presidente da CBF compareceu a   uma prele??o da sele??o), o Tcnico Mrio Zagallo, o Sr. Amrico Faria, supervisor da sele??o, e o Sr. Ronald Rhovald, representante da patrocinadora Nike. Os jogadores reservas permaneceram em isolamento, em seus quartos ou no lobby do hotel. A princpio muito contrariados, os jogadores se recusaram a trocar o penta-campeonato mundial por sediar a Copa do mundo.  A aceita??o veio atravs do pagamento total dos prmios, US$ 70.000,00 para cada jogador, mais um b?nus de US$ 400.000,00 para todos os jogadores e integrantes da comiss?o, num total de US$23.000.000,00 (vinte e trs milh?es de dlares) atravs da empresa Nike. Alm disso, os jogadores que aceitarem o contrato com a empresa Nike nos prximos 4 anos ter?o as mesmas bases de prmios que os jogadores de elite da empresa, como o prprio Ronaldo, Raul da Espanha, Batistuta da Argentina e Roberto Carlos, tambm do Brasil. Mesmo assim, Ronaldo se recusou a jogar, o que obrigou o tcnico Zagallo a escalar o jogador Edmundo, dizendo que Ronaldo estava com problemas no joelho esquerdo (em primeira notcia divulgada s 13:30 no centro de imprensa) e, logo depois, s 14:15, alterando o prognstico para problemas estomacais). A sua situa??o s foi resolvida aps o representante da Nike amea?ar retirar seu patrocnio   vitalcio ao jogador, avaliado em mais de US$ 90.000.000,00 (noventa milh?es de dlares) ao longo da sua carreira. Assim, combinou-se que o Brasil seria derrotado durante o "Golden Goal" (prorroga??o com morte sbita), porm a apatia que se abateu sobre os jogadores titulares fez com que a Fran?a, que absolutamente n?o participou desta negocia??o, marcasse, em   duas falhas simples do time brasileiro, os primeiros gols.  O Sr. Joseph Blatter, novo presidente da Fifa, cidad?o franco-su?o, aplaudiu a colabora??o da equipe brasileira, uma vez que o campeonato mundial trouxe equilbrio  Fran?a num momento das mais altas taxas de desemprego jamais registradas naquele pas, que seriam agravadas pela ent?o recente introdu??o do euro (moeda nica europia) e o mercado comum europeu (ECC). Garantiu, tambm, ao Sr. Ricardo Teixeira, atravs de seu tio, Jo?o Havelange, que o Brasil teria seu caminho facilitado para o penta-campeonato de 2002.  S confirmando o que todo mundo j sabia... porm, a certeza de que foi   realmente assim faz desanimar....   Torcer pra que? E vc sofre torcendo, n?o???  E se chegar na final contra o time da casa???

Lo de Ballack fue coraje, no olvidemos que jugo los 120 minutos  del juego recuperado hace poco de una lesin y por ultimo no fallo el gol que le toco  echar en la definicin.  Nada, que independientemente de cualquier error que hallan cometido los rbitros el juego no se defini por eso sino por el error de el manager argentino de jugar a la defensiva y con los alemanes ese tipo de juego es Fatal.|`|ba6fb3465be87dfe6486b627737e9fc9aa	Bueno... ya se saba! La final tiene que ser Alemania vs Brasil, si alguien no se enter que revise un poco la historia de los mundiales. No creo que Ballack haya sido el mejor! Creo que el arbitro (de un buen primer tiempo) hizo estragos en el segundo tiempo, perjudic claramente a la Argentina. Amonest a Rodriguez por "tirarse" en el rea alemana cuando, en realidad, la pierna del alemn lo cruza... la pelota, estaba fuera del alcance del alemn; claro penal. Ahora Italia le ganar a Ucrania, Brasil a Francia e Inglaterra a Portugal. Luego Alemania eliminar a Italia y Brasil a Inglaterra. Finalmente, Italia ser tercera al vencer a  Inglaterra y, hay que joderse, los dos mximos favorecidos de los arbitrajes de casi todos los mundiales... Brasil y Alemania llegarn a la final; quien ganar?... Alemania organiz este mundial para ganarlo... todos lo sabemos pero Brasil es Brasil.

4778a7ebeb67ebcd810629b82259f043aa	Mxico no se re de Argentina para nada, Argentina mereca ganar hasta el minuto en que mete el gol, despus Jos Pekerman se equivoca de estrategia y solamente trata de defender el gol cuando Argentina haba demostrado tener la delantera ms eficiente del mundial (1 de cada 3 disparos al marco terminaban en la red vs 1 de cada 7 de Alemania), y olvid que a Alemania no la puedes matar con un solo gol (recuerden Mxico vs Alemania en Francia 98 1-0, 1-1, 1-2 favor Alemania), teniendo una delantera tan poderosa como la Argentina no puedes renunciar al ataque, adems hasta antes de los penales Alemania haba fallado solo un penal de 14 tirados en su historia en los mundiales, mala estrategia llegar a penales contra ellos ?no crees?, tal vez una muestra de soberbia... En general claro que Argentina fue mejor en este partido... pero el futbol no se trata de merececimientos sino de goles y Alemania dio una leccin a todos los equipos de cmo se deben tirar los penales (sobre todo a Mxico y Suiza)... enhorabuena sabemos que todos los mundiales se tratan de todos los campeones (Argentina, Alemania, Italia, Inglaterra, Francia) contra Brasil... el cari?o se lo llevan los equipos que dejan el corazn en la cancha... y respecto al tonto que dice lo de "marranona" ?cmo te puedes expresar as de uno de los jugadores que revolucionaron el futbol en el mundo?...

El desarrollo del partido demostr que el equipo alemn no es superior al argentino que se retira del mundial invicto en 120 minutos contra todos los rivales.Solo poda pasar a la prxima instancia uno de los 2 y esta situacin se defini con los penales en los que Alemania fue ms certero . En este tipo de definiciones es necesario un poco de fortuna y esta vez no nos acompa?.A pesar de todo felicitaciones a la seleccin argentina y a la de Alemania que fu un digno rival ypas a la semifinal .  Lo que s quiero aclarar que lamento la opinin de fanticos de selecciones que han quedado eliminadas en rondas anteriores y que desde su resentimiento deseaban que no clasificara la seleccin argentina.Hay equipos que no han clasificado nunca ms alla de los octavos de final y otros que cuando organizaron un mundial no pudieron ni acercarse a la copa. Nosotros tenemos una trayectoria.Dos ttulos del mundo,dos finales del mundo 4 ttulos juveniles mundiales y a nivel de clubes infinidad de copas libertadores de Amrica e intercontinentales. Creo que a pesar de este partido en este mundial somos el 5o equipo mejor del mundo y sin duda el 2o mejor de Amrica en toda la historia despus de Brasil.Adems jams un equipo americano ha sido campen en Europa salvo Brasil del 58?Uds que critican que son?En cuanto a las faltas tuvimos la misma cantidad que los alemanes y hemos tenido uno de los equipos que menos ha pegado en el torneo.Para hablar hay que tener fundamentos.|`|58a1ecf474572916d5558cf3c6005b9aaa	Quien marca un golecito y se pone atras a dejar pasar el Tiempo,eso le puede salir bien una vez contra Mejico con suerte, pero contra Alemania que no sea Quejica si Pierde , Alemania ha ido a ganar y gana quien va a por Ello .Despues queda mal Lloriquear que si los Arbitros.|`|4095b5c49055139969aa93f49b07117eaa	Es increble lo que he ledo!!!!!! algunos el da que ense?aban a respetar al prjimo en el cole se perdieron por el camino,verdad?.Es un deporte,es ftbol,no se trata de insultar o faltar a la gente!!!

Argentina jugo mejor, y el partido era nuestro, hasta que se lesion Abbondanzieri. Creo que como pasionales que somos, a los jugadores les cost acomodarse ante un imprevisto como ese. Ah Klose meti el gol y el partido se fue de las manos. A veces esa pasin tan caracteristica nuestra (y que por lo que leo en este foro la mayora odia, por confundirla por sobervia) nos trae problemas (como cuando El Diego debi retirarse del mundial de USA y los jugadores no pudieron ordenarse). Pero esa pasin es caracterstica del Argentino, no podemos, ni debemos dejar de sentirla, es una de las pocas cosas que nos unifica. Y por mas que nos odien por sentirla, estara bien que aprendan a aceptarla, porque es lo mas nuestro que tenemos... y les aseguro que as como nos trae las mas dolorosas lgrimas, tambien nos brinda los mejores momentos de nuestras vidas.     Estoy muy contenta con la actuacin de la Seleccin nacional en la copa del mundo ms alla de los resultados finales.   No creo que este grupo, y que los hinchas hoy por hoy sean sobervios. Sepan entender que fue muy dificil, en pleno quilombo (lio) en nuestro pas a finales del 2001, ver a la seleccin nacional no pasar a los octavos en el 2002, y creo que pocos estaban ilusionados con una copa del mundo este a?o, despes del palo que nos pegamos en aquel mundial. La sobervia ya no est... solo el orgullo y la pasin.     Los muchachos argentinos se fueron ganando el espacio en nuestros corazones partido a partido, y hoy, incluso luego de nuestra eliminacin ante Alemania, insisto con el orgullo y el agradecimiento eterno a la seleccin que nos represent.

1b825261533d0da176973b5f5c67305faa	yea i used to have that problem too. what you have to do is when you pop and kick the board, you need to either lift up your legs more or jump higher. you should feel that your board is really far under you when you jump. also, don't kick too strong. you might be kicking down instead of out in front of you. hope i helped and keep sk8in.

1b825261533d0da176973b5f5c67305faa	there's like 3 different ways, so find which one of these works for you. first, you HAVE to be moving. you can ollie and then start your spin in mid air, you can ollie off into the backside direction so you're already half way there and then you spin, or you can "wind" your body up. line up your shoulders with the board and crouch and as soon as you ollie, use your arms to start spinning. i like to use the first method best. the only problem i have with all of these is that i usually dont spin hard enough. ive landed at least one out of all three methods, so just find what works best.|`|cd068e35b9b56a6c48d2c7cbcd63d191aa	dont suck
417e9e17b194fd826a4820fdbed8ff05aa	I personally think America is too slow to catch on because we're used to high scoring sports, sports where points are easy to come by, and sports where points are guaranteed.  America also has a bit of a "superiority-complex" (we like to win), so being equivalent to another team is unacceptable, we want a superior team to come out of the match.  Football (real football) doesn't provide any of these.  Para sempre futebol!|`|8fb345e4004562e3a541615a88e879feaa	America is different.  We have our own measurement system.  We have more money and more murders.  We have our own sports (by the way I dont like America, and I love true football).  Oh, and fishball, we hosted the cup in 94.  And the women hosted it back-to-back because China couldnt do it in 2003 because of SARS, so we hosted the womens 99 and 03 cups.  So that is three cups in less than ten years.  So...yeah.|`|eccac0c0df04db985bee2454cc73e83faa	I assume you are talking about what we Yanks call Soccer. We are slow to catch on because there is no money in it yet. At least not in the way that football and the NBA enjoy. There are youth programs and other attempts to professionalize it but it isn't a sport money has been thrown at. Yes we could probably field a good team if not a quality semifinals team but we just don't have the will to channel resources to it. You just have to watch it in Europe, Sorry!|`|e8d65b71f3e65d012ccee0ad1c5ccad5aa	Soccer isn't america's game. Football is! Like australia.

If FIFA is truly "for the good of the game" then it's about time the World Cup tournament be held in the US - never mind soccer is not a biggie - this is one of the most effective ways to promote the game. Bring the celebration of FIFA World Cup to American states... and let the games begin! Don't just think about ticket sales, capacity attendances and million-dollar corporate sponsorships - this is the perpetual greed of FIFA and its leadership which are a mockery to their own motto: "For the good of the game"|`|1f92015d93097820ca09a3b4d165fe8caa	I guarantee if they made it a little longer in the world cup ithere weould be more people would watch it, but not nearly as much as the superbowl.

After 110 minutes, in the age of 34, after so many hits and specifically the injury in the shoulder, after so much effort and with such a great football history...Materazzi a no-one in front of Zidane (to football skills and background) comes to insult him like that! Zidane acted like a man! Nothing else to say!|`|AA10308692	BOO sore loser, he's good at head butting no doubt!... the golden ball is peanuts, the CUP is what matters!

But he is a very talented soccer player with a huge potential, albeit ugly. If he goes to Arsenal, which there is talk of, I will be a huge fan of that ugly MOFO.|`|AA12046919	Yeah in a car accident, and he is also a rude and arrogant bastard as well!  :(|`|b942b41a462f4769a1939a559a389eddaa	Gosh tony c that was mean but hilarious.

Will that make you happy then (mauron P)?    Frank looks like that, because he is the 'lovechild' of the Elephant Man and Napoleon Dynamite!    PS. Is it me... Or does Mauricio P, look like he has had a sex change???|`|d3c29bb6ae8ed59382bb37512b94b22eaa	Exactly, I read the story he was in a car with his father, he was 2 years old, and they had a bad accident. He is alived just for miracle. And look at him after that trauma in his chilhood. So succesful in life, happy, he has a beautiful wife, who loves him very much. And he has beautiful kids. Everybody says he is a great man. He is humble, noble, intelligent, blessed by god with those admirable legs, and he may have a bank account that you must envy. So don't be jerk and don't call him ugly. People is not value for how they look.. they worth for who they are. Who is Ribery ?. A great and beautiful soccer player. Who are you ?. Nobody, and ugly MOFO.

AA10120375	Yo, I am so glad that someone asked this question because i've wanted to teach someone. OK, first setup like an ollie, and find the ledge. Approach with moderate speed, and pop an ollie farther away than you are comfortable with. You should connect with the object on your front trucks and nose.lean foward, but not too much, because you do not too fall foward. From there do a pop drop and land. You can do them on any ledge or fun box. After that, you'll figure out how to nose slide. Good luck|`|1b825261533d0da176973b5f5c67305faa	all your weight on the front foot, actually like 99% on the front and 1% on the back or something like that. if you put all of your weight on the front foot, you would like fall into where you were stalling.|`|AA11196166	i hit it like a nose slide exept a little slower and u hold it like u wood a noseslide

d94be6b870759f5cdda9f5867d87ed40aa	Well it's more of an illegal use of the hands call, the defender has just as much right to the ball just as the receiver does. If the receiver puts his hands on the defender and it interferes with him trying to catch it it is called offensive pass interference. It's a good rule when you think about it though because the offensive guy can just have his way with the defender without the rule. Hope this helped!!!|`|4c7324a96c6d7c4afa1ce0ace584719eaa	say we was playing football.I was the reciver and you the defender,you are covering me good so I push you away to get open,you would be mad wouldn't you.Thats where the call comes from.|`|fc2bf0c5c18672809868c6f540007fb4aa	Basically you can shove the defender but if you "straight arm him" that's when it becomes pass interference.

38484210a7f82c018eaf5f1503b1a8a5aa	O Senna foi muito melhor    O melhor de todos os tempos eu acho o que  o Ayrton Senna ou o Juan Manuel Fangio (piloto 5 vezes campe?o na decada de 50) porque:  1- os adversrios do Senna em rela??o ao Barrichelo, Alonso, Raikonnen e os outros que "duelaram" com o Schumacher (na verdade o real duelo em pelo menos 5 titulos foi contra o prprio carro). N?o tem nem como comparar  2- O Scuhmacher tem muito mais corridas que o Ayrton Senna, o Jim Clark e o Juan Manuel Fangio e que uma rela??o entre o numero de corridas e pole position  muito mais favorvel para os 3 (poles em 40%, 36% e 53% das corridas, respecitvamente enquanto o Schumacher 32%).  3- Em rela??o a vitria entre Senna (25%) e Schumacher (36%) mas o Fangio tem 48% e tanto Fangio quanto Senna correram numa poca que a quebra do carro e falta de gasolina era comum.  4- O Juan Manuel Fangio disputou sua 1a temporada (e a primeira temporada da histria da Formula 1) aos 39 anos e foi 5 vezes campe?o (disputou 9 temporadas, sendo que em uma s correu as primeiras corridas e se aposentou e em outra sofreu um acidente que o tirou do resto da temporada), quer dizer que se tivesse ele tivesse come?ado com a mesma idade que o Schumacher, seria no minimo 10 vezes campe?o.   O Senna poderia ter ganho pelo menos mais trs campeonatos se n?o tivesse morrido em Imola.

Aqui en el foro sol en butaca naranja y verde cuesta creo que $70 y en varios estadios del norte cuestan entre $60 y $80 atras de home y los laterales son mas baratos pero cuando vallas te recomiendo que escojas un lugar atras de home. El ambiente la verdad es unico y muy curado uno tiene que ir a un estadio de beisbol para ver el tipo de ambiente que se pone y cuando gana tu equipo pues el ambiente es mucho mejor. Ahora qu va a empezar la temporada de la liga del pacifico haber si te puedes dar una vuela a algunas de las plazas como son: culiacan, mazatlan, hermosillo o ya mas al norte mexicalli en donde el ambiente es super curado y los boletos no pasan de $100    Saludos|`|36f9fee7aa6f5afafcb358c2ff9f39adaa	el ambiente es muy chido, y los precios vara desde 20 pesos hasta 100 creo, en los play offs entre yucatan y los diablos en el d.f.|`|14409995978a0f26d9a8bf1dce9c7700aa	depende del estadio|`|406b93f92630008d05a8b3a9a4987ce5aa	de pende el estadio pero normalmente son como de 50 pesos el mas barato y 350 el mas caro, tambien puedes aparta rlos palco son mas caros pero es ams chido|`|059f775a537527844cec25b6df079052aa	en saltillo los boletos en temporada regular van de 10 pesos hasta 75 pesos y en play offs cuesta lo doble
AA11859670	I don't think he is a bad coach, but he doesn't have enough experience. He has only coached Livorno in his short career and he did very good, but that's not enough to give him such an enormous resposability, to coach the national team after what they did in the WC. He has double resposability first to be Italy's coach, then to make himself be as succesful as Lippi, but it isn't easy since Lippi had a lot of experience and a lot of years coaching big clubs like Juve or Inter behind. They did a mistake by making Donadoni Italy's coach, cause they put him in a big pression by the media and by everyone around. He needed to coach a big team first then they could think of him as the c.t of Italy|`|a4c3fb8294fadf415ffeacca795fe744aa	The guy is a WHIP...he needs to learn how to coach..even if he did he won't reach Lippi's level in a million years.....Italy's just a name with no action....their world cup win was fake!!|`|36641ab65bfc369586a3838665ea3308aa	well since he has arrived, Italy are playing...not good.

AA12376076	"double if you take it to Cleveland" Not necessarily......  Research the item before you put it up for sale. Search eBay's completed listings for similar items and see if you can come up with a general drift for the value of the piece. If you feel uncomfortable listing it on eBay yourself, use a consignment broker and give up a percentage to the broker to sell it for you. Right off hand, you may not think the percentage is worth it, but the right guy that knows what he's doing will be able to demand and receive a lot more than the average Joe guy who doesn't understand the sports memorabilia business.  What you have there is worth some bucks to the right buyer indeed!|`|395ba13b6215bd11920db288b39e6959aa	I do not know what it is worth, but it'll double if you take it to Cleveland.|`|AA10896198	not much but just to be a nice guy i'lltake it off your hands for $ 20.00 at great cost to my self|`|a3a05f5fe40e5decb51baaf326683e1eaa	worth some but a lot more in cleveland

f1fd994c7fcbe412cd1da621bd69158eaa	Nope. That puts him 3rd behind Lundy and Morency.    Coach Kubiak has said that Lundy will be the starter all along. Since he is familiar with Dayne, he may opt to use him ahead of Morency as the 2nd back.    Don't expect Dayne to be the  1 back unless Lundy goes down with an injury. With the luck the Texans have had, that wouldn't be too farfetched.|`|553a517c8da568e732818b870d9e9527aa	He may not get that many carries, but you watch - he'll be the guy at the goal line.|`|AA11597945	I would guess that Dayne will be used in short yardage and goaline situations.

At times they looked silky, and the passing and movement was quite fluid, but they also looked quite lazy and arrogant - I think, considering the standard of their opponents, they should have done much better. Having said that, it was just a friendly, and Wales played brilliantly, especially in the first half. Bellamy was unlucky not to put one in as well.

36641ab65bfc369586a3838665ea3308aa	Lifestyle: 7 September 2006, Thursday.    It seems that Real Madrid's David Beckham has seriously lost himself in translation these days.    Recently Spanish media burst out news that Victoria Beckham is pregnant with her fourth child, after her husband David answered "yes" to a Spanish reporter's question.  Beckham was signing autographs at the Real Madrid training ground when he misunderstood the question and gave the false information.    The news about baby No. 4 came out some days ago when David Beckham somehow mistook the Spanish reporter's questions on the subject. After reports of Victoria's pregnancy were broadcast on the Internet and on television, the couple had to stand up and deny the previous information.    The language misunderstanding is not the first for the soccer star, who signed with the Real Madrid team in 2003.    NO SHE ISNT PREGNANT!!! WEIRD BECKHAM!!! BUT I DID HEAR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER CHILD AS THEY BOTH WANT A GIRL!|`|cd5bda9eb4a37d8aeb920a75e98530cdaa	apparently not,,dear david misunderstood a question in spanish and said yes to a no question,,although i hear they do want a girl after the boys so...............|`|111a47a6af08763b0189f6fb96fffd43aa	i dont know ..............................????|`|3fc25ceff5fa3abbf418beb1ec2b49d7aa	I heard that they were trying because they are really desperate for a daughter, but as far as I know she isn't pregnant yet.|`|c26d35773dee861a5530e2da4a0f442eaa	Probably the case.

83ce330f797a271b0b0977373ab2958daa	A ramping chip is a mod that can be added to an electro-pneumatic paintball gun, which is a gun that uses a circuit board to electronically control the timing of the firing mechanism.  This allows the gun to have a much higher rate of fire (without breaking balls in the gun) than a person would be able to manually achieve with a non-electric gun.  The circuit board has a set limit to how high that rate of fire can be.  What a ramping chip does is tweak the settings to achieve an even higher rate of fire.  It's a similar concept (but different process) to a performance chip in a car, which increases horsepower, mpg, etc.  So, you put in one of these chips, and tinker with it a bit until you find the settings that give you maximum rate of fire without being too fast (too fast causes the bolt to cycle faster than the paintballs can drop into the chamber, and they get chopped).    All this gets your modern tournament paintballer drooling at the mouth.  So he goes out and buys an expensive electro gun, pays some more for a ramping board, and now can fire paintballs at 15 or 18 rounds per second...  ...and then still gets eliminated by a skilled, old-school player with a manual semi, or a pump, or a stock-class gun.    Why?  because he has neglected the cardinal rule of paintball:  The most high-tech, fastest shooting paintball gun in the world won't make you a better player.      My advice to you, if you're just getting into the sport - go to your local field, find an old-school player, and stick close and learn.  Learn the skills to be a good player before spending money on a high-tech gun.  Shooting those things is a lot of fun, but you won't get to shoot much if you keep getting eliminated in the first few minutes of a game.

0af8fb0bd561e81038a4814a78d06b3baa	Lo scandalo Telecom, rischia di travolgere lInter, il cui vicepresidente Carlo Buora  attualmente nella bufera, essendo lamministratore delegato della compagnia telefonica. Capito? Carlo Buora, risulta essere vicepresidente dell'Inter direttamente tirato in ballo dallex manager della sicurezza, ora indagato per le intercettazioni illegali, Giuliano Tavaroli che venerd aveva dichiarato ai magistrati milanesi: ? Non rendevo conto a Tronchetti, ma al mio diretto superiore Buora?. Se venisse accertato che lInter ha realmente commissionato unindagine su un arbitro federale, potrebbe infatti configurarsi una violazione dellArticolo 1 e art. 6, con riferimento alla probit e lealt sportiva. Stando ai regolamenti, infatti, se un qualche dirigente dellInter avesse nutrito sospetti su De Santis, avrebbe dovuto denunciare il fatto alla Giustizia Sportiva e non agire privatamente. Che cosa rischia la societ di Moratti, Tronchetti, Rossi, Buora ecc.? In caso di deferimento, il rischio di una penalizzazione a campionato in corso  unipotesi concreta. Sulluso che  stato fatto di queste intercettazioni, soprattutto in sede di Giustizia sportiva, che ha basato tutte le sue condanne sulle telefonate del solo Moggi e in parte Meani. E vero che quelle utilizzate dai giudici sportivi erano legalmente autorizzate dalla Procura di Napoli, ma tecnicamente venivano prodotte dalla Telecom di Tronchetti, massimo sponsor interista e del Vice Presidente Buora, oltre che dell'azionista telecom Moratti, ora coinvolta in questo scandalo. Chi garantisce quindi sulla bont di quelle intercettazioni? Non viene il dubbio che potesse esserci una censura a monte, magari operata dalla stessa Telecom? Pi un confluire di conflitti di interesse nello stesso versante non  indizzio sufficente per l'allegra giustizia sportiva a senso unico?

Quando ho letto la tua domanda sono stato come investito da un potente fascio di luce celestiale e tutto mi  apparso finalmente pi chiaro...  Dev' essere sicuramente perch l' Inter ha preso il posto della Jxxx ai cosiddetti piani alti che gli unici due punti fin qu lasciati per strada dall' Inter sono da attribuire ad un arbitraggio di mxxxx (forse non pilotato, ma innegabilmente incapace!).  E dev' essere per lo stesso motivo che a Vieira sono state comminate ben tre giornate di squalifica mentre l' anno scorso bench fosse gi di gran lunga il calciatore pi falloso della serie A la vecchia trxxxxa non ha dovuto rinunciare a lui neanche per un solo turno di squalifica in TUTTO il campionato!  E dev' essere sempre per lo stesso motivo che SOLO ogni volta che Mancini o un altro interista apre bocca vengono adottate le cosiddette misure disciplinari "esemplari"...  Ti faccio notare, inoltre, che Tronchetti Provera ha gi da tempo ceduto a Moratti la quota di Inter che deteneva.  Grazie a quelli che la pensano come te, ma hanno pi potere di te, l' avventura di Rossi da presidente commissario di F.I.G.C.  durata pochissimo e anche Tronchetti Provera non  pi presidente di TIM ne vice-presidente dell' Inter.

Poi ti ricordo un'altra cosa da circa 15 anni un certo Zeman andava dicendo queste cose e noi tutti in italia lo prendavamo per pazzo, un ex albitro che aveva denunciato che durante i sorteggi si aprivano le palline nell'urna non ha piu' albitrato.

La mia impressione  che non sappiano accettare una punizione estremamente mite in confronto a quella che meritavano e che vogliano chiudere un occhio o tutti e due su quello che ha fatto la juve certamente non solo in tempi recenti... se non  una cupola quella...  Cercando di essere oggettivi, mi pare che allo stato attuale delle cose sia presto per avere chiaro come stiano le cose riguardo alla faccenda telecom e che quindi, mentre per la juve  gi venuto fuori molto marcio (per il quale  stata punita ben poco), per l'Inter  un po' presto per tirare conclusioni. Secondo me, chi non ha paura della verit, farebbe meglio ad aspettare ed evitare conclusioni affrettate... per poi accettarla serenamente, qualunque essa sia, spiacevole o meno...|`|6142c00e907138d832b7531a3fef5813aa	scudetto alla ROMA !!!!!!!

0843d6584e43c331a1f97a7b82bf2dd6aa	Maybe you could ask your school for help. You can ask your teacher if you can speak to the principal, and tell him what you think. Tell him that you were wondering if he could start a school dance team. If you don't get a chance to meet with him, write him a letter. In the letter, you can say that you were wondering if you could start a dance team, and if HE could help you start one. I tried this because I, in fact, was 11, and I LOVE to dance! If not, ask your dance instructer if you could maybe teach one of her classes. When you get older, maybe you could start a dance school, and it will be all YOURS!

70d4fd036825e5b7fbb4682aec9a956eaa	The NFL awarded the franchise, for the 1953 season to the city of Baltimore, with Carroll Rosenbloom as the team's new owner. The remaining players on the Dallas roster became the Baltimore Colts team. A previous team of the same name had joined the league as part of the merger with the All American Football Conference, but folded after the 1950 season. In 1960, the league made a second venture into Dallas and established what would become a more successful team, the Dallas Cowboys.      Originally called the Dallas Texans, the club was founded in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League. The team moved to Kansas City and became the Chiefs in 1963 after then-Kansas City mayor H. Roe Bartle guaranteed to the team that they would have increased ticket sales. The Chiefs then joined the NFL as part of the AFL-NFL Merger.    The Chiefs hold the distinction of being the second AFL team (after the New York Jets) to defeat an NFL club in an AFL-NFL World Championship Game when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV.|`|5a64e48ca9c3f7fe98e8ed5bfe3101e0aa	1963|`|7f2eb0d716c09317efbf076240069cc0aa	who cares they both suck|`|AA11414524	The Texans moved to Kansas City in 1963 and became the Chiefs.|`|54fa3f78c4bc33e22ece65f642755b71aa	1963|`|a7b8ddfa3165ae9c97daabfea2078f19aa	The Texans became the Cheifs when they moved to Kansas City in 1963.

d82cb459303da449d6b7a9df16f70725aa	it was a great game. i still say the best game i've ever seen was the nd and usc game last year (followed by the national champ game). usc won that game..and hell i'm not even a usc fan. young was fantastic and single handely kept texas from losing that game. best player on the field that day-hands down. (even if bush STILL had over 200 total yards). but that game wasn't called right and it was obvious from the get go that texas was given the benefit of the doubt on to many plays. the link down below states that there was a reason give (DURING THE GAME) as to why certain plays weren't replayed (or in one case not done properly) i find this funny. i watched the game. i have it recorded..hell i watche in not to long ago myself    funny..not one mention by anyone on a reason why those plays weren't reviewed or why they weren't overturned. yet in the link i provied the writers claim there was a reason..hmm..i find that funny. but i sure don't recall hearing one..even if i watched it more than once.    but anyway. it was a great game. a game in which texas made some nice plays down the stretch and were usc sat back once it took a 3 score lead and played prevent defense. when in fact..they had took it to young in the second half and he wasn't doing much.. it made no sense for usc to sit back and let him run.THATS ALL TEXAS WAS..YOUNG DROP BACK..YOUNG RUNS..    if i was carrol i'd have kept blitzing young AND stacked the line of scrimage. not let him run AND MAKE HIS FRESHMEN WIDE OUTS BEAT ME. those two had shown they couldn't beat anyone by themselves.    when usc did this (like late in the 3Q) they took a 3 score lead and texas looked done (when they stopped doing it) and got big heads and thought the game was over-AND STARTED TO PLAY PREVENT D AGAIN.    young beat them.|`|1175c07b1af7efa18c3c1c6db3748eabaa	As a UCLA fan I was happy that the Trojans lost, but I agree with you on this one.  The Men of Troy dominated and controlled the tempo of the game throughout; however, a few bad mental decisions by players (i.e. Reggie Bush's lame excuse for a latteral) and coaches (i.e. Pete Caroll's decision not to run the ball late in the game) cost them the game and more importantly the championship.  Oh yeah, and let's not take anything away from Vince Young who had the best game of his life.|`|AA11465445	vince young|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	ok so vinces knee was down when he pitched it to selvin.....but so what we would have scored on the next play anyways. nothing against usc that was a hell of a football team and i honestly thought they were gonna beat texas, but vince young just does things that no one else has ever been able to do and he was gonna make sure that trophy came back to the ATX.|`|eedbc9e134db1a07185f9cca66280063aa	Texas beat our butts!

As for Rock his movie career has halted a bit (latest flops include gridiron gang and some indie film whose title I can't remember) However, thats not to say the movies sucked or he sucked.  I think he's a great actor and very funny as well as charasmatic.  On him coming back, I think he would but right now wouldnt be the time.  DX is on the rise and that's the bottom line.  Stone Cold could come back with managment responsibilites and take down Bischoff should he return as well~|`|7f4750198db63c387a87a7905711707baa	stonecold is the rock i dont think so|`|0316fc9ef3fd70ccd3b97e3f86639fa6aa	I read somewhere that Stone Cold is Comming back in Feb, for soemthing.

Steve Austin IS contracted to the wwe, but his knees and back are severly damage from all the abuse over the years. So the probability a in-ring preformance is next to nil. As far as managment or hitting vince with a stunner, however, is in the cards. Austin has creative-control over his character, so if he does'nt want to, they can't make him. Must be nice!!!!|`|89a96a6cee365f054319086a8689cd08aa	i hope so.....bt i dnt think rock will be bk cause he hs became a big sellout at a time he used 2 be my fav wrestler bt nw i only kno him as a sellout......austin will come on PPV's i guess
4133a10daa153b6fa97d3be5665cad5baa	Yeah I have to agree with you all on that. Randy Orton is a good wrestler by himself and the way the storyline is going it looks like they are trying to build Cena up to go after the World Heavyweight Belt and have Orton be the new WWE Champ. It would be nice to see him with that belt though he deserves it and I think it would go great with him and he would keep that belt for a long time as well.|`|0c94b546c337f60e4e94fbbfaf76006baa	He's cute but I don't like him.|`|af8a53d818d9eccc44276375b03f40c0aa	He is the future of the wwe no matter what anyone says.

86543422cd673099401a3cc6b18757adaa	Ya varios te han dicho que tu respuesta depende de varias condiciones: inclinacin del terreno, velocidad y sobre todo, tu peso corporal que no lo consignas.    En las fuentes de referencia te adjunto una tabla de los gastos metablicos publicados en el libro de Fisiologa del Ejercicio de Willmore y Costil. Las intensidades estn dadas en Mets, un mets equivale a la unidad metablica y representa 3,5 ml de oxgeno por kilogramo de peso y por minuto.    Para saber cul es tu gasto en caloras, ya que desconozco tu peso corporal, has t mismo el clculo utilizando la siguiente ecuacin:    (Mets x 3,5 x Peso Corporal)/200= Kcal/min    Supongamos que pesas 70 Kg y eliges trotar en llano  a una velocidad de 12 Km/h, tu gasto metablico sera de 9 Mets/min, con dichos datos reemplazas en la ecuacin y obtienes las caloras gastadas.    (9 x 3,5 x 70)/200= 11,025 Kcal/min    en una hora seran= 661,5 Kcal/h    Si eliges andar en bicicleta a una velocidad de 20,9 Km/h tu gasto metablico ser de 9 Mets, si resuelves la ecuacin vers que correr y la bicicleta dan un mismo resultado para las intensidades de trabajo elejidas, siempre y cuando se hayan realizado en terreno llano:    (9 x 3,5 x 70)/200 = 661,5 Kcal/h    En cambio, si se trota a 12 Km/h con una pendiente del 10%, el gasto metablico ser de 18,57 Mets, lo que equivaldr a 1364,9 Kcal/h.    El componente vertical aumenta el esfuerzo y lo mismo ocurrira tratndose de una bicicleta pero le dejo al interesado resolver el clculo, si salbe cul es la ecuacin para eso...    Por ltimo me permito aclarar que: si el caminar o trotar se hace en un treamill de inclinacin regulable y sin tomarse de las barandillas, el requerimiento energtico es mucho mayor que si no movemos los brazos. En cambio, el ejercicio en bicicleta est localizado a las piernas y por eso para un igual gasto energtico realizado caminando o trotando, en bicicleta se requiere mucha ms velocidad, lo cual queda demostrado al realizar los clculos.    Atentamente: Shifu Martn.|`|a8f008018132b3419b255e68e3fb1062aa	definitivamente no, la caminata si quema caloras pero el gasto energetico en bicicleta es mayor, as que toma tu bici y a quemar caloras...|`|b086ac8da17af877ec5a5c3b50a9e52faa	Creo que no es posible determinarlo fcilmente, por la simple razn de que mucho influyen las condiciones como las practiques, por ejemplo si caminas a paso rpido, trotando, en subida, etc. o si pedaleas en terreno asfaltado, pista, en cross, etc.    Valdra la pena que intentaras hacer tu propia medicin en una caminadora y en una bicicleta fija, pues las que hoy en da hay en los gimnasios te indican las caloras que quemas en funcin de tu peso y rutina que elijas.|`|vIexi0cGaa	no la bicicleta es mucho mejor a menos que quieras correr ,lo cual todava es mucho mejor|`|AA11411121	No... cada ejercicio tiene una escala de quemar caloras diferente, depende mucho de la intensidad, la inclinacin, la resistencia en ambos....

Yes about World cup Sachin's record in WC is amazing so he will definitely keep the momentum in the next WC, there is no question of surpassing sachin in Wc since he is way ahead of others, Sachin had scored 1732 runs in 33 matches in the current players Ponting is on 998 in 28 matches, Lara on 956 in 25 matches, Ganguly on 844 in 18 matches and others like Drawid, Gibbs arouns 750 runs, so no threat as such to the record of Sachin in near future.|`|fabc6981fb31665c38e28ad3cd2f790daa	hard to say as he could have a bad patch of form in the world cup

AA11124471	Right now, I think the Jostens company makes the Super Bowl and Championship rings.|`|fabc6981fb31665c38e28ad3cd2f790daa	i sure do!|`|5OGDmGRmaa	The Super Bowl ring is an award in the National Football League given to players and coaches of the team that wins the league's annual championship game, the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl Championship Ring is the ultimate prize for a professional football player.    These rings are typically made of yellow or white gold with diamonds. They usually include the team name, team logo, and Super Bowl number (usually indicated in Roman numerals). Most of the rings also have larger diamonds or diamonds made into the shape of the trophy, that represent the number of Super Bowls that franchise has won (thus, Pittburgh's 2005 ring has five trophies, representing the five Super Bowls they have won).    The rings are made at the Jostens facility in Denton, Texas. The NFL pays for the rings, with up to 150 rings per team at a cost of up to $5,000 a piece.
