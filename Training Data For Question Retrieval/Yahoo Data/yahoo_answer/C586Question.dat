20090129041234AAOPqXB	Health;Women's Health	Do you think gynecologists ever think bad things about their patients?	I'm about to get my first pap smear, hopefully, this weekend. I'm 17, and I should have gone when I first started being sexually active, but I've refrained, out of fear. I think it would be an extremely awkward experience, and for having social anxiety, that's not a good combination. But I know I have low risk HPV and I shouldn't have let it just be, without getting checked out or anything.       Anyway, back to my question, it's mandatory for gynecologists to be professional, and act rationally, but do you think they're ever thinking, "what a whore," in their head? Or something?       Like if someone had 5 STD's, I'm sure the gynecologist would think negative things in their head and it would make me feel bad. I'm not saying I have 5 STD's or anything, but I still don't want to be ridiculed and have them put on this "nice" facade, when they're thinking differently in their head. It's nothing I can change, and that's where the refraining from attending comes back into place.

(my friend) A few weeks of finding out she was pregnant started to bleed heavy with clots.. she thought she had miscarried the bleed continued and she went to early pregnancy unit had scan 'saw babies heart beat' was told that she may have had twins and one miscarried very early on.  continued to bleed constantly but clots stopped.  At 9 weeks she had a scan and all was fine. Saw babies heart beat was told all ok.  But still bleeding not as heavy and had approx one day where there was no bleed.  Then at 11 weeks went for scan,(still bleeding but lighter)  No heart beat!! shocked and upset she chose to have medical miscarriage. This meant that she went into hospital as a day patient and was given ERPC (basically they removed the baby with suction or something like that) She is still bleeding 3 weeks on and she says no sign of it stopping...

I've been on Yaz for a month and i had started it on the 5th day of my period which was 6 days long.       Is it normal to not get a period at all after the first month of being on the pill? Because there is no sign of it and a few days ago i had a few cramps which made me think that i was coming on but nothing. So obviously i am really worried that i might be pregnant!       My boobs were also hurting me for some time but i think it was more of a side-effect of the pill rather than pregnancy.

20090129044815AAmHBNo	Health;Mental Health	Oh my God, he has another cut... I'm worried that he's cutting himself!?!?! Please, please answer!!?	Ok, well, my fiance Patrick's best friend Andy recently tried to commit suicide twice. He's in the hospital now, and Patrick says when he goes to visit, Andy just doesn't want to live anymore. I know this hurts Patrick so much.... him and Andy have been friends since they were 13, and they're both 26 now. Well, I'm worried about Patrick, because 1. He's an independent singer and he's been writing really dark, depressing lyrics. and 2. I found a cut on his hip, which he claims is from moving things at work (He works at a concert hall setting up stages for concerts), but I'm worried that he is cutting himself. I know that he used to cut before his depression was diagnosed back when he was 23 or so... It still scares me and upsets me when I see the scars near his shoulder. Well, last night, Patrick was at the recording studio with our friend, Pete, and Pete called about an hour after Patrick had gotten home and said that he had seen a new cut on Patrick's shoulder over the scars and that he just wanted to let me know, because he's also worried about Patrick. Anyways, his depression has never been serious like this before, but I guess it's kinda kicked into high gear since this all happened with Andy. I'm not sure if he IS cutting or not, though.

20090129043841AA42jua	Health;Other - Health	Why am I tired? Should I see a doctor?	I'm often--but not always--tired, in every way there is to be tired except drowsy; mentally, physically, emotionally, and I often feel somewhat stiff and/or sore, or just drained entirely, as if I'm dragging my body around.  I typically have a small amount of caffeine in the morning but no later than noon, I don't drink alcohol or soda or smoke, the only drug I take currently besides the caffeine is an antibiotic for acne.  I drink only milk and water and very occasionally juice, and though I may not drink quite enough all the time, it seems like when I do consciously try to drink plenty of water I end up peeing constantly which is annoying.   I have been improving my diet and it isn't perfect, but I primarily eat chicken, yogurt, high fiber/protein cereal, trail mix bars, fruit, wheat bread, chicken/veggie soup, and whatever vegetables I can make myself eat (less than the recommended amount but at least a serving a day).  I take a multivitamin and fish oil supplements.  I sleep fine, and for 7-9 hours.  There is minimal stress in my life.  I walk for five to nine hours a day, five days a week (my job=walking), and for a couple hours a week I will get some other exercise.  There is a lot of variability in how I feel after I exercise.        I feel like I'm trying, but could minor imbalances like not quite enough protein or vegetables one day or not quite enough water the next cause me to have no energy and feel sore?  Is it all the walking?  Or should I actually get checked out for anemia or hypothyroidism or something, even though I don't really have any other symptoms (I am sensitive to cold, but I'm pretty sure I always have been)?

20090129045852AA4iOLE	Health;Other - Health	You need to know this if you're an organ donor...?	The following occurred in Illinois.      Recently, a young married man unexpectedly passed away in a local emergency room. He had signed up to be an organ donor. Within moments of his passing, the nurse inundated his wife, questioning her which organs they could take, organ by organ. Eyes? Skin? Veins? Liver? Heart? Etc., etc. The nurse was apologetic but extremely pressing and hurried in her questions because she said they had twenty minutes before the organs because useless. Thus, the questioning had to take place quickly and immediately. The wife said it was absolutely horrible – here she was dealing with the sudden death of her husband, and at the same time, feeling she was desecrating the body. After a few minutes of this trauma, the wife said, “I have to stop. I can’t do this.”        No one tells us this when we sign up to be organ donors. Second, the spouse can change the desires of the donor and refuse the organs.      Wouldn’t it make more sense that when we sign up to be donors, we fill out a checklist of organs we’re willing to donate, so loved ones don’t have to go through this trauma? This list can be easily accessed because it could be in a variety of areas:  in the possession of all local hospitals, available on the internet, etc. That way, no questions need to be asked. Loved ones only need to be told that the process is underway as per the instruction of the deceased.      Also, should loved ones be allowed to refuse the organs?      People need to be made aware of the above, and someone needs to do something about this.        Suggestions?

20090129051252AAmIUNK	Health;Mental Health	I don't know what am I fighting for?	Hello, I'm Eliza.   I have one problem since i became 23 years old.I feel that my life is like a cyclone that never stops. Like I get in the metro and can never get out. When I have to feel happy I don't, when I have to be sad I laugh..It's like going a minute back. Like I don't have the time to feel what's going on- like i'm a robot. I do everything perfect. I feel ok with it. But sometimes when I wake up the morning I feel like I want to run-away BUT I don't know from what??? Even if I change things or try them other way around or do both sides I feel the same. I don't know what's the point to try in general.I feel like whatever is going to come it will come whatever you do-so I don't care anymore. I don't want to go back-I certainly don't. Now I see that when I want someting, it hides a double responsibility behind it if you want to keep it. Otherwise you don't want it.So sometimes I want to go to sleep, don't talk, don't want nothing. Everyday I feel like I give 10 things to get 1. So I stop cold sometimes and think. But I feel like everything is a lie, fake. The only thing that helps me last minute before I leave everything and collapse is my memory, my progress 'till now, the targets I make.    As I grow older breaks from life become shorter and work gets a bigger part of me. How am I going to get used to it?      p.s. I can never put my Priorities in order. Everytime I start 1 thing, one week later I have done 100 different things but do not finish or keep any of it. And then i forget. I just want to prove I'm not useless and I can do many things. If I start 1 thing and try to keep it I feel all the others are going to leave me alone because I care too much about that 1 thing. And i feel guilty.

20090129050344AA7N3G9	Health;Women's Health	How do I get my periods to come faster?	I know I will regret it xD because I get bad stomach pains, but really?      Its ether bad stomach pains or 46 degree C heat =-=      The only way I can stay home from school and away from the stinging ( yes, it actually STINGS my skin >< ) is if I get my period...      it usually comes around the 10th, but this is important! I cant stand the heat much longer! I dont eat during the day so I can stay in the air conditioners ( not allowed to eat inside )      so I go all day on water, and wander around the school ( the locations of each of my lessons are different, and some are far away with no shade )      how do I get my periods to come faster so I can get tomorrow off?!
20090129050610AAUaMmg	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Did Temp Agency screw up? Or just me?	Worked as a temp for 6 months. I had a problem of being late maybe 2-15 minutes AT TIMES in the later months. It was not habitual. And since they started sending me out of town, I got lost a couple times or didnt' realize the travel time in winter. Once due to an unknown bypass I wasn't familiar with, I lost an hour's pay looking for the place notwithstanding the time from when I started(another hour, honestly could not find it). They paid mileage but not travel time. All this time however, regardless of their getting out of me what they needed, they were accruing incidents against me yet without officially writing me up for anything. This I was told by a fellow worker that they had to document and show write-ups to show disciplinary action against me, which they had never done. The one guy always chastized me even from day ONE so I knew they were asses to begin with. I messed up twice and when they called me on it, I always took on another shift for them and "made up" for it especially when the woman asked, "please take Sheldon." even when it was against my schedule. Yet they forgot this back N forth I would recomspense yet when I failed the 3rd time to show, they said they wouldn't use me again. I asked, what does that mean? on probation? what? They claimed not to fire me but to not "use" me again. BUT i never had any written warnings/write-ups til that day when they said that. Is that legal? ARen't I to know when they are imposing disciplinary action as this and at any time and realize when the hammer's about to fall? I would like to comment further that I am an outstanding employee and my last employer's director even called me up personally to call me back into the field for my work/effects on the job. Can I collect unemployment or what? I live in Iowa by the way.

I'm starting to realize the world as a whole, and am going completely insane. I was living in my own little world created in my head for a year or two mixed up in weed alcohol and painkillers. I was doing fine in college, but am really starting to regain reality. It's extremely scary, and i'm having a lot of flashbacks and pain I have put off for so long. I have cried for about 4 hours straight (although it has been years) and have class in a few hours. I have already missed too many days, and just have no idea what "reality" is anymore. Lately I have been drinking a lot but have also cut back, and no longer smoke weed or take anything. I have no idea what is going on and am just completely lost. Any ideas? It just feels like an emotional breakdown which will probably either get worse or clear up with sleep. I am not willing to take the risk, I have been up for over 24 hours and don't see sleep in the near future at all.

I need to take this question out of my mind it has been there and on my conscious since my ex and I split up 2 months ago...    We had a nasty break up where I have lost it and hit him in the back of his head! I am miserable since then I have immediately apologised to him and we never spoke since. We work together and he never looks in my direction or talks to me and his performance is very bad.    Now, during our 2 years relationship I have been very down, I have been called every name in the world and ignored and punished a lot. Basically I stayed because I loved him and his young son very much. Everytime we would argue I would be asked to leave and then we would made up told that we can't live together as after arguments I always leave him! is so twisted I know...    And the list goes on....    I am starting to feel better now, my work is picking up and just carry on really and I am so disgusted of what happened but I can not change it, almost sick! I feel like he is happy that I ' finally ' proved him what a nut case I am though I have NEVER shouted or screamed before. He WON!   Is just weird...I sense he is happy it turned out like this...But me...I am being left questioning my sanity and I cry while I write this...    His ex , the mother of his child hit him 3 months back too and I was so hurt by that..and now..its me.    Anyway, he now ignores me...but everyday i wake up questioning myself!

Well yesterday my eye had like, 2 red veins, one in the bottom and one at the top inside. Today it's spread a bit so it's more like a red patch, but my entire eye isn't pink. I can kind of feel it when I blink. I took my contacts out and just wore my glasses. I can kind of feel it when i blow my nose or put any kind of pressure on it like that.       Does this sound like pink eye or a broken blood vessel? Is there a way to tell without going to the doctor/eye doctor? (I'd rather not take off work if i don't have to)...       Thanks

And when we met, we both agreed not to have sex until we were married because we want our relationship to be different. So anyway...we're going along like any regular couple would..(falling in love with each other)...but one night we were on the phone and he said he had something to tell me. So i was like "ok, what is it?" And he slowly but surely broke me the news....it was sooooooo hard for him to tell me you guys. But he told me that I was innocent and he loves me and he cant allow me to walk into something without knowing and he NOT tell me like his ex-gf didnt tell him. So....a BOMB has just been dropped on me....but for some reason, i dont care. I love him...ok NOW. He told me that he just found out about a month ago. He heard through facebook that his ex had it( they broke up last year) ..but he's NEVER had any symptoms..no outbreaks...just like back pain or whatever..but of course he didnt think anything of it since he works out all the time.He had already been to the doctor last year for his well-man and everything came back negative.He told me that he wanted a follow up check up and he went back again and the test was positive. Now, if he had contracted herpes last year and he went for a check up, wouldnt i have come back positive then? If you have Herpes, then you have herpes and the test will prove that. Did the clinic make a mistake? I read all kinds of articles about it, "you may have no symptoms at all"..but have you personally EVER heard of anyone contracting HERPES and NEVER having an outbreak within the first months of being exposed????? Could the clinic could have made a mistake by testing him positive? I personally dont think he has it...no bumps, blisters, buring when peeing, itching...nothing. test the first time...Negative. Test for a follow up...Positive. Is it possible, that he ultimately does NOT have it?OR should he go for third test with an actual specialst? Insight please. No rude answers... Thanks!

My company charges for my wife and I $163 a WEEK for health insurance and once the baby comes that will go up to $220 a week.      Ive looked at every program in NYC and they refuse to help because my job offers it even though I pay the majority of it. Health Care Plus, HealthyNY (basically the same cost), some private insurances and found nothing. I can get insurance for the baby but once the baby is here I can no longer afford $163 a week.

I need to take this question out of my mind it has been there and on my conscious since my ex and I split up 2 months ago...      We had a nasty break up where I have lost it and hit him in the back of his head! I am miserable since then I have immediately apologised to him and we never spoke since. We work together and he never looks in my direction or talks to me and his performance is very bad.      Now, during our 2 years relationship I have been very down, I have been called every name in the world and ignored and punished a lot. Basically I stayed because I loved him and his young son very much. Everytime we would argue I would be asked to leave and then we would made up told that we can't live together as after arguments I always leave him! is so twisted I know...      And the list goes on....      I am starting to feel better now, my work is picking up and just carry on really and I am so disgusted of what happened but I can not change it, almost sick! I feel like he is happy that I ' finally ' proved him what a nut case I am though I have NEVER shouted or screamed before. He WON!    Is just weird...I sense he is happy it turned out like this...But me...I am being left questioning my sanity and I cry while I write this...      His ex , the mother of his child hit him 3 months back too and I was so hurt by that..and now..its me.      Anyway, he now ignores me...but everyday i wake up questioning myself

I always said I would never put up with a guy like that but hopefully someone out there can relate to the weird hold they get on you. I did everything for the kid and it still wasn't enough. His friends have told me in the past few days no one could have treated him better. Not to be conceded but I am a very pretty girl and I have a lot going for me. I had to hear how I was a bad person, I wasn't pretty enough, i was a waste of space, I was dumb...ect. He made me feel completely worthless. He told me the whole relationship ending was my fault becuase I made him miserable. He needed to leave because he was afraid he was really going to hurt me one time. Im having a really hard time coping and need some advice. Like I said hopefully someone can understand the weird hold these people get on you. Advice on how to cope or understand? I'm heartbroken over someone who doesn't deserve the light of day...

I believe in abstinence, so masturbation is my only form of "release." I normally masturbate in the bathroom, where cleanup is only a flush or rinse off away, but have been getting bored lately.       I have heard that most guys prefer masturbating in bed instead. I've tried that a few times, but I was so tense from worrying about messing on my bed that it wasn't really worth it (one time i caught with Kleenex, and once with a sock, but I "shot" so hard that it went through the sock material). I enjoyed some of it, like the sensation rubbing up against the blankets, but was too tense to relax. Both times I was under the blankets on my back, in only a tee.      What am I doing wrong??? I have heard that some guys are so relaxed masturbating in bed that they fall asleep in the middle of their session! Help!

20090129063517AAqWC7s	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	NITS???????????????????	Does anyone have a suggestion of a nit killing product that they have used themselves that's available in the U.K. and ACTUALLY works 100%??? My 2year old daughter picked up nits from somewhere about 4months ago and since then I thought a losing battle against the dirty little b******s!!! I've used various over the counter products, done follow up combing, conditioning and I washed every bit of bed linen, item of clothing and towel in the house (and the rest) after every attempt...I thought she was finally louse free then ten minutes ago I ran a comb through her hair and there it was the biggest, fattest nit you ever saw! I can't understand it, when I was a kid I had nits on several occassions and all my Dad did was throw a good helping of "Durbac" on us and sit us between his ankles like papa gorilla and give us a good comb through...voila, job done!! No messing about with conditioners etc. Why doesn't that work now!?!    I'm almost to the point of cutting my little girl's hair ridiculously short so if someone could tell me a guaranteed simple solution that they use with 100% results themselves I would be ETERNALLY grateful, It's either that or leave her with my Dad for a few days and even in his dotage see if he can sort it out! (By the way he scratches his head in bemusement as to why I'm struggling with them like I am!) Somebody please help and thanks in advance , Steven.

Should he go to the doctor and check certain things out? Can you be too small? He's about 131 pounds, he's in pretty good shape for his size though.     Also, I heard after you take them, you have to work out until you sweat a lot or something or you'll die. Is that true? is there a certain way to take them, or can you just take them and chill and just work out when ever like however you always do? Thanks a lot

20090129065430AAlfQYV	Health;Diet & Fitness	Will increasing my caloric intake make me fat?	hey guys.. i have another question :)      So.. i am 16 years old (boy), i weigh 67-70 kg (it varie) - 152 pounds   and i am 177 cm tall (5 foot 9'').      I workout (semi-intense) With free weights and machines 3 times a week but other than that i am mostly seated during the day at school and at home/      Many websites tell me that i should be eating 2700 calories to maintain and 3500 to build muscle.   I am eating around 2000-2200 (and not gainign weight or loosing, i am just sort of toning muscles).      I know it is not enough but i just came out of a period of time wher ei was eating around 1500-1600 and i was forcing myself to purge sometimes during the day.   So my metabolism is probably really bad..      anyway, i already increased to 2000-2200 and i feel better but i always feel bad because oi think i am over eating.      Will eating my maintenance recommended level of calories cause me to gain weight?

I will snap at my girlfriend very quickly, little things will make me extremely angry, and I don't know why. I also have been having a terrible time sleeping lately. Last night I woke up pretty much every hour, with "feverish" type dreams (I didn't have a fever, but my dreams were like those you would get if you had a fever - extremely weird and repetitive).       It actually has me kind of worried because I don't know why I have this sudden change in how I am. I don't know if its stress or what, but its bad. I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder over a year ago, and was on paxil for about 8-10 months (off now) and I think some anxiety may have stuck around.      If anyone has any ideas of what may be causing this and how I can address it, it would help a lot. Do you think its a vicious cycle? As in lack of sleep = agitation = lack of sleep = agitation and so on? Thanks.

Three GREAT people I know have this common denominator but are from very different backgrounds. I have talked to one friend about this and she said it might be a cause.  Why would, if it even does, effect the body like this from repressed emotions for whatever reason?

20090129091434AAuDxoZ	Health;Women's Health	I have a yellowish to whitish discharge, no smell, slight itch, what is it?	I know what a yeast infection is, Ive had it before, where it was extremely itchy, really red, 'cottage cheese' discharge, and pain while urinating. Ive taken the Monistat medication before, and it worked great.       And just recently I had another yeast infection, used the medication, went away..      Weeks later, I have a continuous flow of yellow.. clumps? But not hard, more liquidy if anything. There is no smell what so ever. And it itches on occasion. I also get a white build up in the hood of the clitoris.       Is it just another yeast infection? A minor one? Why do I keep getting them, and is there a way to prevent them?

20090129070813AAF9eJK	Health;Women's Health	Finger prick at yearly?	I am scheduled to go in for my yearly exam on Feb. 2nd.  I am going to the same place that I began going to when I found out that I was pregnant with my daughter last year.  They did a yearly exam at my initial appointment last year because I was due for one and they do one anyway when you find out that you are pregnant.  I had a lot of typical blood tests done with them, the regular ones you get when you are expecting.  I called to confirm my appt. the other day and she told me that I would be getting a finger prick, pelvic exam, breast exam, and pap.  My old doctor, before I was pregnant, didn't do finger pricks at yearly appts., and everyone I have talked to says that their doc doesn't do them either.  My question is:  Is this a normal thing to get done at a yearly checkup (pap smear appt.)?  And if so, why do they do this?

20090129084745AANrIkg	Health;Other - Health	How do I assure my psychologist that I'm really o.k.?	I'm not really sure what to do. I recently started seeing a counselor at the beginning of the summer and in dealing with some sexual abuse issues for the first time I felt really overwhelmed. I felt like I was losing control because for the first time since I can remember I was allowing myself to feel. I tried to put control back into my life by restricting my intake (bad idea I know) and that got a little out of hand so in trying to get control over that my cutting became more frequent (at least every other day). My counselor at the college I attend doesn't know that I cut but she did refer me to a psychologist after I lost 120 pounds in 5 months. (I was 285--now I'm 160) I told my new counselor about my cutting (mistake again) and now she won't get off of it. She is constantly saying how concerned she is that I'm going to kill myself. How do I help her understand that I'm not   trying to kill myself but that this is just something that works for me right now. She also keeps asking me to show her--Isn't that a little off--I mean why would I want to show anybody? I don't know what to do. I don't want to lie to my psychologist and tell her that I've stopped cutting if I haven't but I also want her to see me as someone she doesn't have to worry about because I don't want to have to stop going there. My counselor and psychologist are the only 2 people I have to talk to about stuff like this and if my college counselor finds out she'll have to report it because of the college's policy. My psychologist has said she might have to tell my counselor if I can't stop but I can't and don't think I want to. I don't want to lose either support person and don't know what to do. Can you help?

I'm also still drinking tons of water and taking probotics. How long should I give it before going back to the doctor for a prescription? I really dont want to have to go back - my health insurance sucks and I end up paying most out of pocket. How long would you wait?

20090129071041AAicJ08	Health;Women's Health	Is it common to have soreness 8 months after implant surgery?	In May 2008 I had breast augmentation surgery (please don't judge--I had gastric bypass in '04 and, while now thin, I am in need of cosmetic surgery like this and beyond).  My procedure went very well and after a few days of pain I was back to work.  I followed my doctor's orders to the letter and went back for my check-ups.  The last one was my 6 month evaluation.  I'm not due to go back again until May for a 1-year exam.        It took some time for sensation to return to my nipples.  In the past couple of months, that sensation has been mostly unpleasant.  You know how your breasts feel sore and tender when you're on your period?  Well, mine feel like that nearly all the time now!  My good friend had implants done about a year before me and she has referred to having overly-sensitive nipples.  I would classify what I'm feeling, though, as borderline painful.  Is this normal?  Will it subside?       I don't know if it matters or not, but for reference, I had silicone implants and am now a large C/small D-cup.  I don't think they're too large because when I was a heavy woman, I was a D-cup so I definitely had the room & extra skin to accomodate what the surgery gave me!      Thanks for any info/input!

He said he was 'pretty sure' he pulled out in time, so 2 days later I went and took the morning after pill. The doctor told me that I might get something like a false period, and that next month I should take a pregnancy test.   Well, a week after I took the pill I got my period again (I finished my last period like a day before the sex), and yeah. It was really heavy, which is not so normal for me, but I decided not to think much of it.   Now for the past week I've been feeling a little naucious (feel like puking after meals), getting dizzy and really weird stomach cramps and aches... I always get some sort of aching pain on the both sides of my tummy and I've been much hungrier than usual.   Also, a lot of people I know smoke. I don't, but I never minded the smell. Now when people smoke around me I feel really sick and I tell them to go somewhere else.   Could this be side effects from the pill? Or, if you were ever pregnant, did this happen to you? I'm a little strapped on cash so I want to get a pregnancy test only if it's extremely possible that I'm pregnant.      also, it was my birthday  last week. I was in the moment, and I did consume alcohol since I didn't think I was pregnant. If I am pregnant, could this be why I'm getting all these pains? Cause of the alcohol? I know that you're not supposed to drink at all when pregnant, that's why I thought I should throw this last part in   :) thanks!

20090129070908AAL3ke6	Health;Mental Health	I've been diagnosed with D.I.D. (formerly called Multiple Personality Disorder)?	The symptoms are not dramatic and you'd have to know me really well to even notice when I am 'switching' from  one 'personality' to another.  However, I am really scared.  Does this disorder basically mean my life is screwed?  I got the disorder as a result of severe abuse during childhood (sexual and emotional abuse).  I would really hope to get married, have kids and own a home in future but I feel terrified that I am now "insane".  I do manage to hold down a really cool job and I do have friends but I am finding romantic relationships difficult (I pick the most abusive men)

It takes a lot for me to trust someone, and I'm still very unsure as to why I actually am Depressed. But I was just wondering if anyone had any advice to actually help me take the step to getting this help that I need so bad. And if you didn't mind, maybe explaining how your therapy or counseling went. Thanks so much!

Still active, but never at 100 percent. Would be very sore for a few days after strenuous activity. I figured he had to rebuild muscle,growing pains,... Muscle and joint pain intermiten, but now more often. Sometimes struggles to walk.Sore back or knee or shoulder,,Is it possible the staph is in his body? Was a concern before because staph was under toenail of a fractured toe. Blood tests were OK and he seemed to recover. Doc ran some tests yesterday but discounted my theory because there is no fever. But he never had a fever with the Staph before. I am planning to contact his Infectious Disease Doctor to see if it's possible and how to test for it. Any advice? Anyone been there? Please help.

20090128213951AAIzQwZ	Health;Alternative Medicine	Posture for meditation?	I know that when meditating, a recommended posture is to sit on a chair with your upper body "balanced" and relaxed with chest slightly forward, shoulders rolled back.  However when I try to do this I encounter several problems.      For one thing, it does not feel at all relaxed.  I feel stiff and rigid in this position.  Also, they say this should "open up your lungs" and make it easier to breathe fully and slowly, but for me, it feels like my breaths are more shallow.  Like I can't exhale nearly all the way and it seems like half of the air stays in my lungs and won't come out unless I push it out.  Breaths don't come naturally in this position either; it seems like I need to make a conscious effort.      I'm quite tall; I don't know if that would have an effect.  I know the point of meditation is to clear ones mind, and I could be over-thinking this whole thing, but I would like to know if anyone else has encountered this, or if there are any suggestions.      Thank you.

I had a physical recently and my doctor told me that my blood sugar was 101 so I should keep an eye on it.  I've been very good about what I eat for 1 month now and yesterday administered my own blood sugar test using the OneTouch Ultra 2 in what would be considered a "Random" testing and received a 92.  I thought, "Great, what I'm doing is working."  The problem is that this morning after not eating for about 12 hours I did a "Fasting Blood Glucose" test and the result was 105, a retest showed it at 99.  Is there any reason that the fasting test (12 hours no food) would be higher than the random test (4 hours no food)?  Does the OneTouch just suck?      Any help would be appreciated.

A dr apt is no where in site.   Its not uncommon for me to have "ice pick headaches" which I know for me is caused by migraines. Its also not uncommon for me to feel jittery and tired if I have sugar or caffeine or work out without enough food. Lately it seems I need to be full immediately before any of these things. I have two examples Ill try to keep brief.   Last week, I ate, 45 minutes later I was on a cardio machine. A couple minutes later I had an ice pick headache but worse than normal. My site was foggy(vision is 20/20). I got off the machine and went to the locker machine and had that same headache which usually lasts 30 seconds but this time 5 minutes or so. I was nauseous, lightheaded and drained of energy. I ate and felt better.   Yesterday, I was in the car with my mom, I was driving. I got that headache but on the left side instead the usual right. I was quite lightheaded, very hot even though it was 20 degrees outside. The inside of my head felt hot and I was very jittery. but when I touched my heart, it was beating at a normal pace. I dont know what word to use but Id say I felt disoriented but not so much I couldn't drive. I wanted to pull over but my mom was going to miss her flight,so I wouldn't stop. I felt off balance,like I had a hard time staying in a straight path but not swerving into any other lane. I was also very nauseous. When I ate, I felt better.

To make a long story short, my son couldn't urinate, a valve in his urethra had grown backwards causing his kidneys to back up and fail and also causing him to run out of amniotic fluid.  The doctors told me that if they kept doing bladder taps I could carry to term, but that my son would die because of the kidney's failing, and that I might hemorrhage to death because it would be a dry birth and if they did a C section they might have to take everything and I'd never be able to have kids.  So we made the heart breaking decision to terminate.  I was told at the time that it should take about 3 months for my period to go back to normal once I got it again.  Well, its been almost a year and its still not normal.  I have to use maternity pads the first 4 days its so heavy.  And the pain.  I never really had cramps before, but now I feel like my insides are being ripped out.  If I stand or sit on the toilet for too long I feel like everything is going to fall out.  Sorry to get kind of graphic there, but I don't know how else to describe it.  It hurts so bad I can't sleep and I cry most of the first 4 days from the pain, the 5th is fine.  My OBGYN says that its probably still all from the termination, but he can't tell me when it will be normal again.  My boyfriend says I should try going to another doctor, but I've been seeing this one for 13 years.  Has anyone else had an experiance like this?  Can some one shed some light as to what's going on with me or offer any advice?  Thank you in advance.      Also, please don't critisize me because I had to terminate a pregnancy.  I didn't want to, and I thought I never would, but I didn't want my son to suffer.  I wouldn't let my dog suffer, why should I let my son?

My ear isn't blocked just a constant pain that i can't relieve.      So i looked up remedies for it and it says the best thing for it is paracetomol, which i'm allowed to take. So which painkiller would you think is best?      500mg of Paracetomol.   or   Sudafed, which i was prescribed for blocked sinuses, which also contains the same amount of paracetomol.       I was thinking the Sudafed because my earache is caused by blocked sinuses so it would give me a little extra help don't you think?

What can someone do to help you?  My nephew is suffering from clinical depression.  He is very smart, had a great job, had a girlfriend, has loving parents, lives on a beautiful lake.   He has been in treatment for years, been committed several times.  He has quit his job, tried to commit suicide so many times his girlfriend finally said enough and that it was over.  He doesn't want to live at his parenst house, yet he doesn't have anywhere else to go.  He has no money because he has no job.  Any one of us would do anything for him.  If you are someone who is clinically depressed what would help you?  Yes, we know therapy, and medication, those are a given but that is not helping.  what else can we do for him?  He is 24 years old so his parents can't force him to stay at home.  He hates being in the hospital and always behave well enough to get out after a week or so.  We would do anything for him.  thank you for any ideas.

The pain still never went away, I went back yesterday, She pulled the offending molar out, but the pain is still here, Sure I know you have to allow pain for her poaking etc, but this is the exact same pain I have always had, The pain is coming from the hole where the tooth was.

Any advice much appreciated as I am well and truely !!!!ed of with this. I've been living on pain killers for a month.

Yesterday evening me and my boyfriend had sex, everything was really good beforehand with the foreplay etc and even when he first entered me it was fine ( no pain then ), it was all great until about 20/30 minutes into it and it started to become really painful.      I'm not going to go into much detail about it, but there was a huge amount of pain, just inside me, on the right hand side only ( sounds odd...i know! ) I tried to position him differently and it did seem to help a bit, but it kept coming back to it.      In the end my boyfriend could see i was uncomfortable and we just stopped, it has never been painful before and we hadn't had sex in about a week.      Has this ever happened to you? also this is random as well, i went to the toilet before we started any foreplay etc and then as soon as we stopped i needed to rush to the toilet, which doesn't normally happen? do you think that has anything to do with it, or not really?

Last night I think is the worse experience I've had in my life. I woke up with heartburn and went to the bathroom to get some medicine. (Well thanks to the cold that I have and this bad cough) I started coughing to the point where I felt like I was choking and the whole time my throat and chest were on fire. And it kept getting worse to the point where I was throwing up and crying from pain because my heart burn was THAT bad. When I finally was able to control my cough I ate about 12 rollaids and drank about a half a gallon of milk and it would just not go away. Eventually I just laid down on my back and ate some ice cubes to cool down my throat and I finally fell asleep. But however I woke up this morning and I still have heart burn (thankfully not AS bad)   Does anyone know any good medicine for heart burn/acid reflux? Or any good home remedies? I used to take zantac all the time because of my frequent heartburn and now it doesn't work for me.   Thanks in advance.

20090129081428AATE6bI	Health;Men's Health	Do I have Prostatitis?	Okay I have been highly stressing over this for the past week. I have come a long way from my initial question as to whats wrong with me. To some up I am a body builder. I use all types of supplements, for the past 3 months I was on Testosterone boosters, not to be confused with anabolic steriods. They naturally raise Testosterone levels, then in the past month and a half I got on pro hormone which is basically a naturally occuring compound that converts to a small amount of an anabolic steriod. The entire month and a half I had no symptoms at all. For the end of the cycle I used a "designer anabolic" called dymethazine for about 2 weeks I had no negative side effects only great strenght\size gains. About last Wednesday I noticed that at the end of urinating I had a slight burn only for a second. Then last thursday I began to urinate very frequently and was up almost all night uriniating and it didn't feel like my bladder was empty. I immediately got off all the supplements and went to get a Prostate Health formula from the vitamin store containing saw palmetto, pygmeium, pumpkin seed extract, etc. So in order to prevent estrogen rebound men take natural testosterone boosters to restart there natural testosterone product called Post cycle therapy. So the only supplements I use are a natural testosterone booster and this prostate health formula. The next day I noticed a slight burn while urinating just one time. My urine was a much darker color. So I took an over the counter UTI test and tested negative. As the past week went on my symptoms started to subside I noticed a little lower back pressure nothing painful. I did a lot of research looking up Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostatitis and am wondering what I have. the past week with the exception of last night I slept pretty sound and my urination is strong flowing again. Last night worried me a bit I urinated a lot but I felt relieved every time, a lot of urine came out so its not like it was only dribbling. This morning after sex I noticed my semen was thicker and slightly clumpy. The worst symptoms are gone but I have no insurance can anyone shed some insight please.

20090129082110AAeGwyX	Health;Mental Health	I feel really unhappy :( What can I do?	I'm "recovering" an eating disorder, and have put on half a stone (7lbs) since November... I know that's not that much and it sounds silly to say this, but I'm afraid of putting any more on and if I do gain a pound, I do my best to go back down a pound.    I'm eating regular meals most of the time, but no snacks and I seem to stay at my current weight. I know I should put more effort in getting better and my dietcians would tell me to add snacks, but I am scared of gaining any more :(   My parents think I'm doing so well in recovering but they don't know how I feel inside - I'm even not having a drink for three days at a time! Which I know is really bad, but now I'm eating, I don't want to have a drink because I like feeling in control.   Also, because of my e.d, I have to go home for lunch, and I don't really get to see all of my friends because I'm not in the same lessons as some of them so i don't have much of a social life in school.   Sometimes it seems like I'm putting on this happy front for everyone - friends, parents etc. but really I feel unhappy.      The thing that confuses me though is that I don't always feel unhappy, it's like it comes and goes. It's really bugging me now, because I don't want to feel like I can't do anything/ like I'm fat even though I know I'm not / that no one likes me :(    Because I know I have great friends and they're always there.      How can I stop feeling like this?? :(   I'm sorry I wasted your time and would be grateful if you could help me x

20090129082710AAmqmQt	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Metathione can cause cancer?	I am 17 turning 18 and I've finished a bottle and a half of Metathione. I've decided to know more about the product and I've read that it helps cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. But I've also read something that says it causes cancer. I don't know which is true.       Though before I was not using Metathione, I was taking just Glutathione then I changed to Metathione since they say it works better than any Glutathione supplements.       So, does it cause cancer? I know there are no evidences that it cures or causes cancer, but do you know any individual who had cancer after taking Metathione?      Before I take Metathione I asked my doctor if it's all right and he told me it's fine as long as I take the right dosage. I am taking 2 capsules a day which is 500mg of reduced glutathione and 300mg of Vit. C.

20090129082320AAnzQcJ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	What could be causing high blood pressure and low pulse in a fit, 19y/o male?	I'm 19/M 6'2" and 170lbs with no family history of just about anything. I visited my doctor and she noted that my blood pressure was 132/90 and that I had a fairly slow pulse (55-58) for not being very athletic (I only started working out about a week before the visit and had not worked out for probably a year before that). All blood work was normal, and an ECG showed fine. I am a very anxious person and always worrying about something - especially about my health. I've previously had an echocardiogram several years ago because my GP heard a "split gallop", but was giving the all clear and they said I had a "great heart". I've had a history of high blood pressure as well.      I should also add that I eat a very healthy diet - I'm at college and everyone thinks it's strange how healthy I eat as they scarf down their greasy hamburgers. What sucks is I've asked friends who eat like crap and their blood pressure is always awesome (110/70 etc). :-(      I should also add that I drank the night before the appointment and had not eaten in 12 hours because they requested that I fast for a blood test. I hardly ever drink, by the way.      Any ideas? I'm baffled by this considering I'm a lean, young guy with no family history.

20090129082815AAyP5qD	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Major back pain... any doctors out there?	I'm 17, and a gymnast. I have been in gymnastics since I was really young. So, when my back started killing me about two months ago, I wasn't surprised. But I got it checked out by my family doctor. Just by feeling it, he thought it might be fractured. So I got an x-ray, and there were no signs of a fracture, but there was a spot on my back they couldn't ID. So he suggested I go to an orthopaedic surgeon. I did, and he said he thought it might be a fracture or pre-fracture. So he sent me to get a C-Scan I did, and the results were there was no fracture, but the spot was still there. So, I was sent to the hospital to get a full-body scan. The results? no fracture. And, my doctor said the source of my pain was that my bones are just shaped funny, and said it would be ok to go back to gymnastics. It seemed weird that my whole life my bones have been shaped the same and it's just now givng me troubles. But, I've been back in gymnastics and I can barely do anything! It kills everytime I attempt to practice anything. One practice, my back started having spasms and my coaches made me stop practicing. It still has spasms when I try to do anything more than swing on the bars. I think there's something definitly wrong with my back that the doctors overlooked. Could someone please offer their best advice based off my situation? Thank you so much! and if there's any treatment I could do on my own, it would help a lot. Like stretches i can do or something. Thanks!

Its hard to explain but very annoying.  It doesn't seem to be effecting my hearing at all, just an annoying sound.  I don't believe it is infected either because there is really no pain, just a really ANNOYING noise if I move my face the right way.  HELP ME PLEASE I AM LOSING MY MIND!  This has been going on for months now, and I don't have any medical coverage, is there any way this can be fixed/diagnosed?
