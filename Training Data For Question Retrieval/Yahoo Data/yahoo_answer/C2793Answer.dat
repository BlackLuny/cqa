They also got the new baconator! Plus if you want ice cream you can have a frosty.|`|4m7cykryaa	Fast food hamburgers are generally disgusting, anyway. Make your own or get one at a nice restaurant at least.|`|lNsr26oIaa	Wendy's. <br>  <br>  I can't stand DQ's burgers.|`|ZIrTB2oEaa	I would say Wendy's, I love to take that first bite from one of the square corners sticking out of the bun.  Also they have good Fries too.|`|53WL6akOaa	Wendy's|`|UFYOzP41aa	wendy's|`|zINrvrNGaa	dairy queen|`|Mnmw1tzAaa	Wendy's, bar none.<br>  <br>  Something about that square meat....|`|KpO4UtElaa	ew. i wouldnt choose any of those. but i'd go with dq if i had to. mcdonalds burgers are mcnasty.|`|PBp6oaIoaa	Gotta go with the HungrBuster from DQ|`|IWUgDdRGaa	McD's|`|zzyTe5LMaa	Love DQ double cheese!!!

DQ, I've never had one, just their ice cream.|`|AA11091315	Hamburgers: McDonald's because Wendy's hamburger patties are always cold. However, Wendy's beats them in everything else. Never went to DQ for the food outside of ice cream.|`|LxBwmRTlaa	McDonald's has the best Hamburgers.|`|YuYSL0A2aa	Wendy's|`|mRgRDhMQaa	there all good but I like Wendy's !

CdRlOsnyaa	they probably will hire you and congratulations on looking for a job at that age. there basically 3-4 jobs you will do cashier at fron cashier at drive through  working in the back ( putting on hamburgers then putting on ketchup pickles etc) and clean up you will clean up the front where people sit or the back where food is prepared. if your a girl you will most likely be cash. they will train you at night time when its less busy and train you for about 2 weeks. if you havent learnred enough by then they will let you go|`|ATSLuU12aa	Well most likely you'll be working in the back...they don't put you at register first. I mean you might need a workers permit.But it's a good job if you need money and stuff...and it's not that bad of a job.<br>  At least you get a paycheck every week.|`|4m7cykryaa	Ew why would you consider working there? I'd never be a cashier at a fast food place because the people that go there can be real jerks. And not to be rude, but I'll doubt they'll even hire you since you're so young.|`|d3W2m7mdaa	u can work a a cashier or may be in drive by counter or as an worker in arranging packages <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  all the best for ur new work|`|dBS6a7nXaa	work at the mall instead. to sell movie tickets. it's easy.|`|96b1e61f76ef66b8acd752306973f96daa	practice my spanish
rHHm4XNpaa	Yes...<br>  <br>  <br>  What is wrong with that?<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't care.  Why I need to bring someone?<br>  <br>  I even go to movie theatre by myself.|`|k8HpMaHxaa	No, because I know they arent asking to be rude. Sometimes people will leave the rest of the party in the car while they run in to see if we can take them, sometimes they are meeting people, and sometimes they really are just one.<br>  <br>  Its not like we ask to point out the fact that you are by yourself. It could be worse...she could look at you like a lonely cheap table, and decide to pull the 'one person, sit at the bar/counter please'   =]|`|JnLoHaoAaa	That's a pretty lame retort. I usually ask "how many?" as a lot of times one or two people will come in but others will be joining later on. Don't be offended by their question. They just want to know whether to sit you at a little table or big table|`|FyIcIzIoaa	no Im tempted to say no cant you see the other 3 ppl with me *****|`|AA11907692	I'm so sarcastic by nature in a funny way.  I would be tempted to say, "just one?, don't you see the line behind me?"<br>  Or, I've always been wanting to say - "just one?, Do you have a problem with that?"  LOL<br>  They don't mean anything by asking (at least most of the time), it's just their job.|`|zopegiT4aa	that's a pretty lame comeback...it doesn't make any sense because why would they have 2, 4, 6, or even 8 hostesses.  If you want to make them feel bad and realize they were rude when they ask 'just one?' look really sad and say 'yes...my bf just broke up with me...' i'll bet you can get some free food off of that too|`|WbPLarAYaa	if u dont wanna be asked that, dont go alone. if u take that comment so personal, i dont wanna know what other comments u take so personal. enjoy life and dont u care for what other people tell you.|`|kedcv0glaa	That's about the lamest comeback I've ever heard. Maybe they are making sure you aren't just the first person to arrive of a party or if you are dining alone.|`|pZ7B7VFcaa	maybe they are just trying to seat you appropriately as some people show alone but other friends or love ones show up later<br>  <br>  so seating will be different|`|tzrLDbHWaa	No, I don't.  I've been to restaurants before where there's a wait and I get out of the car to put my name in while the rest park the car, and in those cases, no its not just one.  The hostess doesn't know so she asks.  Theres nothing wrong with that.|`|AA10804824	Pretty lame. Come up with another one.
V7JVKApkaa	I've found that if fine dining questions are what you're looking for, it's best to go directly to the particular city your interested in. Right now, there are lots of fine dining questions in the San Francisco section (the city I'm closest to).|`|lys5kB9Daa	i totally agree with your edit- applebees is CRAP- i used to work there in college and i wouldnt even eat the stuff! <br>  oh no everyone's losing their jobs- well maybe they should shop at a freakin grocery store then and not fast food!! i havent eaten fast food in YEARS because i would like to live and not have a heart attack at 50 from eating fried greasy garbage.<br>  the person who said fine dinig isnt even healthier is the biggest moron i've ever heard. healthy people like myself would go to a fine dining place and order seared ahi or something that has like .001 grams of fat compared to 800million grams of fat in anything fast food!<br>  plus i think its like a bunch of bored 13 year olds that ask about fast food...|`|MJyM1XWJaa	I rarely go to fast food but fine dining isn't much better health wise (in most cases). <br>  <br>  Plus people are asking questions because time is crucial and so is money and a lot of people are wondering just how bad their food choices are. Besides, if they didn't ask even the most simple questions how are they ever going to know?|`|GHd84xipaa	yes i do.i enjoy Olive Garden,Longhorn's Steak house,Bugaboo's Creek,Applebees and Ruby Tuesdays,they are all good to me.|`|96b1e61f76ef66b8acd752306973f96daa	it seems most people only can afford **** food|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I agree, it's pretty sad isn't it? But I suppose in this economy who has the money to spend $150 on a nice meal?|`|lcAtoiCIaa	no one can afford fine dinning the number of people without jobs or on unemployment is incredibly high.  Why go to fine dinning when it cost half of your pay check
EJ8iS9R4aa	I know Lucky Stikes in nyc is real nice its not a club its a lounge/bowling. I think anyone under 21 has to be in before 8pm. I'm not too sure look up the website.

Most states have different Mexican restaraunts but I gotta tell you, I am from North Dakota and the ones in Bismarck or so-so only.  Very Americanized as there is not a large Mexican population.  I am now in Rochester MN and there is a greater Mexican population here and some of the restaruants offer fabulous food, not at all like I got in Bismarck.  Depends on your location as to what is available.|`|qE5XIAsYaa	not in NYC...Never heard of it...we have taco bell of course and chipotle|`|Limt9t5Qaa	Here in CALI we have    Filibertos  Humbertos  Robertos  Bertos  Dagobertos  Rigobertos  and all kinds of other bertos LOL...or should I say LOM (Lots of Mexicans)|`|K2IID2yQaa	federicos is popular in other states alot|`|NFt3h7dHaa	I've lived in the Midwest my whole life and never heard of this chain.  However, there might be similar things not available where it is.    For example, here in the midwest there's Chipotle, which aren't in the West/Southwest region (to my knowledge) but out there they have Cafe Rio, which is an almost identical menu but decidedly different atmosphere but there are none of those around here.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	No idea what a Filbertos is

The place had an outdoor area with tables, but the sidewalk was between the restaurant and the tables.  Some drunk guy was walking back and forth down the street.  Ok, he was kinda heavy, and looked like he might normally be a decent guy, but he was totally drunk, and really sweaty.  His shirt was all stained with either sweat or beer.   he tried to harass a group of people that were seated outside, so they moved indoors.  We sat at a window inside looking out.  So the next time he went by, he picked up the cloth napkins on one of the set tables and wiped his face and armpits with it, then folded it back up and put it back.  <br>  We were seriously grossed out.  But then a guy and his parents got seated there.  We had a time trying to get his attention before his mom used the napkin!  Luckily, we did.
