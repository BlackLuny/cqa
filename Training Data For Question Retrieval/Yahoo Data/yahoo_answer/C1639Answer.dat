zvQ1lfuXaa	Well, not exactly. Internet Service Provider, though, has the capability to manage the throughput of your speed. It is actually integrated on the DSLAM on its central office. That depends on what speed that you are provisioned for.

3AkLGAcnaa	Station 1 --> Most quiet, shorelines are the widest although few restaurants and bars are here due to the five star accommodations nearby.  I recommend staying here if you're into serenity and pure relaxation.  Sands here are the most powdery.<br>  <br>  Station 2 --> Middle class accommodations.  This is where all the action is.  Shopping is visible here as well as bars and restaurants which are all within reach.  This is the most crowded area in boracay.  Beach sands are fine and powdery although not that powdery as compared to station 1.<br>  <br>  Station 3.  --> Budget class accomodations.  Local stores and shopping.  Majority are budget class restaurants.  Sands are honestly not that fine here, with few small pebbles.<br>  <br>  If you want to stay in a 5 star accommodation that is within the reach and near restaurants and shopping, try Boracay Regency.  <a href="http://www.boracayregency.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.boracayregency.com</a> They have packages for those staying for 3 days 2 nights.  Also, I applaud them for their excellent international buffets.|`|DnnHqgwGaa	It depends on what kind of beach person you are. If you're a person who just wants to relax, go to Station 1. It has powdery sands and a lot of 5 star accommodations. There are few hang-outs here. If you're a person who wants to buy a lot of souvenirs and be a REAL tourist, go to Station 2. There are a lot of shops, restaurants, and hang-outs. The sand here is pretty average and a lot of people go here, so it's crowded. If you're a person who wants to explore places, go to Station 3. It has normal accommodations, shops, and restaurants here. The sand is not fine and has a few pebbles. If you go farther near the edge of this station, you will be able to see nice places. I hope you enjoy Boracay! :)|`|sSTXLQEUaa	Station 1 hands down. It's more quiet and peaceful. If you want to go to the restaurants and bars at station 2, it's just a tricycle ride or short walk away. Even if you prefer the night life and action, staying at station 2 will be too chaotic. <br>  <br>  Among my favorites include White House resort, Le Soleil de Boracay, Red Coconut, Sea wind, and Two seasons. Some of these are at station 2 though, I think. But any area from sea wind down further the beach are your best bet. So these are seawind, waling waling, white house, fridays, and two seasons.<br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|eDjiOWKtaa	aren't those station numbers a misnomer now since all boats from Caticlan arrive at the back of the island near the old Station 3?<br>  <br>  if you follow the old system, it's kinda lika a caste where if you're staying at Station 1... you're in a fancy hotel resort like Fairways & Blue Water where they have a nice pool overlooking the island and everything is expensive. if you're at Station 2, you're at a nice air-conditioned nipa hut resort with cable TV... and if you're at Station 3, chances are you're staying at a cheap bedspacer room that doesn't even have an electric fan. the only thing common with the 3 stations is the sand, the sun, and the sea.|`|AA11828341	Actually, it doesn't matter because you can walk along these stations anyway so it's okay wherever you are.

I'll cross the border twice next week and I will be cautious but am not too worried.<br>  <br>   If you look at the video someone linked to, you'll see<br>  - 0 tourists have been killed in the period reported (the problems are generally between drug cartels and the police)<br>  - The girls all say they wouldn't stay in Rosarito... not because they've seen something dangerous... but because they think it's a little weird that no one is there! <br>  <br>  Finally, no one can say for sure if something bad will happen or not. Bad things can happen anywhere. Two chilean students (in the US legally) were shot and killed two weeks ago in Florida when they were chatting in a kitchen in Pensacola.

l0F7lSaraa	The best place to try would be Germany, as the need to apply for a residency permit beforehand is waved for US and Canadian citizens. Come over, apply for a residency permit and use the 90 days visa-free stay looking for a job. If you get very very lucky you'll get a job offer, which you then can use to apply for a work permit. Or you'll get a chance to set yourself up doing freelance work. Look at <a href="http://www.toytowngermany.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.toytowngermany.com</a> for more information on how to do this.<br>  <br>  Be warned that your chances of getting a work permit on your own are still very very slim unless you are highly skilled (PhD or higher) and you are working in a field were qualified people are much sought after.<br>  <br>  The other route of immigration (and definitely the easiest one) is to graduate from a European university. Students are granted residency permits and limited work permits fairly easy. Graduates are given one year to find a job suiting their acquired qualifications, if they suceed they'll get a work and residency permit which is tied to their job.<br>  <br>  Finally you should never underestimate the cultural differences between the countries. They are big enough between Germans, British, French etc - and even bigger for people from America coming to Europe...:)|`|RsjPhDoMaa	That's a difficult question, especially since almost every European you ask will say it's his/her country. It all depends on what you want. If you want to live somewhere that kind of has the same environment as CA then I suggest eastern Spain, possibly on one of the islands (tourism is high there, I've been there on vacation a couple of times, it's expensive but life is good). <br>  <br>  If you don't mind snow maybe you should consider Scandinavia or Finland, Finland has the best education in the world while Scandinavia is the best place in the world to bring up a family in (just remember that the Scandinavian countries have the highest taxes in the world, ate least Denmark and Sweden, a friend said that Norwegians only pay half of the normal tax burden during the summer but I don't know if that is true or not) . If you prioritize your carrier however you would want to live in Germany, France or Britain. I don't really that the people are very different mentally in western Europe but ofc I can be wrong. <br>  When discussing the best country in the world you will NEVER HEAR THE RIGHT ANSWER, simply because several studies says very different things. Just see my sources. I've heard that Sweden is the best in several intellectual newspapers like i.e the British Guardian. This newspaper calls Sweden "The most successful society the world has ever known" but that is probably not true. Remember that all countries has its own problems and no country is even close to perfect. You really need to think about what you want. <br>  <br>  Basically. For family life, Scandinavia, Finland, The Netherlands. Carrier, central and western Europe, Germany, France and Britain, possibly also Switzerland. Climate Spain, Italy and Greece. With the exceptions of Greece and Finland, DON'T move anywhere east of Germany.|`|N04cJNeKaa	Germany, munich, its a great place . there are allots of americans there . its busy there like in new york but its a peaceful place.<br>  france is ok but really expensive!!!!!!|`|tvemAOHIaa	spain or england|`|74b14489ed779328bf3e0e159d757571aa	If you have money Monaco.

Some companies have English as a working language, but these are usually in technology, engineering or sciences. If you speak only English (and don't work in one of those fields), the UK or Ireland is the best option. You also generally need to have higher education and/or extensive work experience in a needed field (qualified teaching, healthcare, engineering, technology, science, etc).<br>  <br>  There's no single country that best fits everyone's personality and preferences. Some places are great for raising a family, some are great for specific careers, some are great for certain interests or hobbies.

etV271ARaa	Yes. PR should win the 2012 General Election. Its impossible for Malaysia to evolve into a proper Metropolitan Democracy like the US if the BN continues to rule due to their racial policies. And Anwar is the only viable leader of PR. <br>  <br>  I dont think they will imprison Anwar coz they will have to make the sodomy charges against him stick. Even if they fast track the legal process, it will still take them 18 months. So, maybe guilty verdict delivered earliest by November next year.

54f31ab3782d5867a302804aeea8499caa	Berlin is closest. Shortest driving distances from Hanover (one 'n' in German ) are...to Berlin 173 miles...to Frankfurt 197 miles...to Munich 356 miles. I lived in Hanover for a while...great place. It's quite a pleasant drive now to Berlin but in the days of East Germany the part of the route from Helmstedt on the border,to the Brandenburg gate in Berlin was called the Berlin Corridor (not to be confusd with the Berlin Air Corridor),and was controlled by the Soviet Army,who had military trucks cruising along it 24/7.  All vehicles leaving Helmstedt were given a time to arrive at Brandenburg checkpoint. Arriving too early meant you got done for speeding and arriving too late meant you were driving too slowly and were therefore spying.

I'm from Germany and live near the border to the Czech Republic, and my mobile is switched to "block incoming when roam" to avoid the high fees. Text messages, however, will be delivered if I return back to my home country within a week. I'm with Vodafone. And cellphones do not have regional codes, they have an international number where they can be reached. Standard procedure is that you store mobile phone numbers with the appropriate country code; for my area that would be +49. Most modern networks, however, recognize incomplete numbers, and your message will be delivered.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	The fact they messaged you would make me think they are using global roaming. <br>  <br>  So yes, just reply to the message as you would if they were in New Zealand. <br>  <br>  It will cost you the normal fee but it may cost them a little more.

3264b09af40e6311a70d315c1f4ed8e3aa	It depends on the hostel.  The ones with better security do require you check in in person and show some form of id.  Others may be more lenient.  It would be impossible to know for sure without knowing the specific hostel.  If you are getting your own room though, your friend will have the key and be able to let you in either way.  It's harder with dorm rooms because you can't be sure there will be a bed available, even if he/she does let you in.  Most hostels do have some kind of policy if you are coming after their regular check in hours, they understand planes land at all funny times.  You may want to just call and ask.
UIJorsD7aa	Israeli settlements in the West Bank are legal both under international law and the agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. Claims to the contrary are mere attempts to distort the law for political purposes. Yet whatever the status of the settlements, their existence should never be used to justify terrorism.<br>  <br>  The Palestinians often claim that settlement activity is illegal and call on Israel to dismantle every settlement. In effect, they are demanding that every Jew leave the West Bank, a form of ethnic cleansing. By contrast, within Israel, Arabs and Jews live side-by-side; indeed, Israeli Arabs, who account for approximately 20% of Israel's population, are citizens of Israel with equal rights.<br>  <br>  The Palestinian call to remove all Jewish presence from the disputed territories is not only discriminatory and morally reprehensible; it has no basis either in law or in the agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.<br>  <br>  The various agreements reached between Israel and the Palestinians since 1993 contain no prohibitions on the building or expansion of settlements. On the contrary, they specifically provide that the issue of settlements is reserved for permanent status negotiations, which are to take place in the concluding stage of the peace talks. The parties expressly agreed that the Palestinian Authority has no jurisdiction or control over settlements or Israelis, pending the conclusion of a permanent status agreement.<br>  <br>  It has been charged that the provision contained in the Israel-Palestinian Interim Agreement prohibiting unilateral steps that alter the status of the West Bank implies a ban on settlement activity. This position is disingenuous. The prohibition on unilateral measures was designed to ensure that neither side take steps that would change the legal status of this territory (such as by annexation or a unilateral declaration of statehood), pending the outcome of permanent status talks. The building of homes has no effect on the final permanent status of the area as a whole. Were this prohibition to be applied to building, it would lead to the unreasonable interpretation that neither side is permitted to build houses to accommodate the needs of their respective communities.<br>  <br>  As the Israeli claim to these territories is legally valid, it is just as legitimate for Israelis to build their communities as it is for the Palestinians to build theirs. Yet in the spirit of compromise, successive Israeli governments have indicated their willingness to negotiate the issue and have adopted a voluntary freeze on the building of new settlements as a confidence-building measure.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Israel had established its settlements in the West Bank in accordance with international law. Attempts have been made to claim that the settlements violate Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which forbids a state from deporting or transferring "parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies." However, this allegation has no validity in law as Israeli citizens were neither deported nor transferred to the territories.<br>  <br>  Although Israel has voluntarily taken upon itself the obligation to uphold the humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel maintains that the Convention (which deals with occupied territories) was not applicable to the disputed territory. As there had been no internationally recognized legal sovereign in either the West Bank or Gaza prior to the 1967 Six Day War, they cannot be considered to have become "occupied territory" when control passed into the hands of Israel.<br>  <br>  Yet even if the Fourth Geneva Convention were to apply to the territories, Article 49 would not be relevant to the issue of Jewish settlements. The Convention was drafted immediately following the Second World War, against the background of the massive forced population transfers that occurred during that period. As the International Red Cross' authoritative commentary to the Convention confirms, Article 49 (entitled "Deportations, Transfers, Evacuations") was intended to prevent the forcible transfer of civilians, thereby protecting the local population from displacement. Israel has not forcibly transferred its citizens to the territory and the Convention does not place any prohibition on individuals voluntarily choosing their place of residence. Moreover, the settlements are not intended to displace Arab inhabitants, nor do they do so in practice. According to independent surveys, the built-up areas of the settlements (not including roads or unpopulated adjacent tracts) take up about 3% of the total territory of the West Bank.<br>  <br>  Israel's use of land for settlements conforms to all rules and norms of international law. Privately owned lands are not requisitioned for the establishment of settlements. In addition, all settlement activity comes under the supervision of the Supreme Court of Israel.|`|i00SbscLaa	Yes the Israeli settlements are illegal because they are built on other people land.<br>  The settlements are built on occupied territories and according to international law they are illegal.|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	They are not ilegal.Jews have lived in Judea and Samaria — the West Bank — since ancient times. The only time Jews have been prohibited from living in the territories in recent decades was during Jordan's rule from 1948 to 1967. This prohibition was contrary to the Mandate for Palestine adopted by the League of Nations, which provided for the establishment of a Jewish state, and specifically encouraged “close settlement by Jews on the land.”<br>  <br>  Numerous legal authorities dispute the charge that settlements are “illegal.” Stephen Schwebel, formerly President of the International Court of Justice, notes that a country acting in self-defense may seize and occupy territory when necessary to protect itself. Schwebel also observes that a state may require, as a condition for its withdrawal, security measures designed to ensure its citizens are not menaced again from that territory.<br>  <br>  According to Eugene Rostow, a former Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs in the Johnson Administration, Resolution 242 gives Israel a legal right to be in the West Bank. The resolution. Rostow noted, "allows Israel to administer the territories" it won in 1967 "until 'a just and lasting peace in the Middle East' is achieved," Rostow wrote|`|nHuMeLtyaa	The ones that were purchased from absentee Arab landlords are not illegal, but they still need a permit to build anything on the land.

I'll start with land that was legally purchased from Arabs. It is perfectly legal to buy land from the person who owns it, and when the UN/Arab states say it is illegal they are lying.<br>  <br>  Onto the 'settlements.' These are not tiny villages comprised of a few tents. They are thriving towns and cities. <br>  <br>  Al Jazeera interviewed Professor Mordechai Kedar of Bar-Ilan University, and he was asked about Israel building in the West Bank. This is what he said: "The West bank does not belong to any nation because it was not under a nation's jurisdiction, unlike the Sinai Peninsula. From what country did we take it? Until 1967, Jordan occupied it. Therefore, we can do what we want."<br>  <br>  When Jordan was in control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem before 1967, they were building there. Nobody complained. When the Jordanians banned Jews from visiting the Western Wall, the UN did not force them to stop.<br>  <br>  When Jordan was in charge, they did what the liked, because they controlled the area. Now Israel controls the area and can do the same. There has been a Jewish presence in the area for thousands of years, long before the Arabs moved in.<br>  <br>  Under Arab control, the standards of living were lower, there was less infrastructure, less security, and Jerusalem was not an open city. Israel has built towns and cities where there once was nothing. Israel has built roads, schools, infrastructure. Israel maintains law and order.<br>  <br>  Now I'd be happy to relinquish the Arab parts of the West Bank, while keeping the Jewish parts, in a peace agreement, however, Israel's security has got to be the priority.|`|iCMrsV9daa	Israel currently has 121 Jewish-only settlements and 106 ‘outposts’ on confiscated Palestinian land. Palestinians do not have any settlements on Israeli land. <br>  <br>  Israel has created in the Occupied Territories a regime of separation based on discrimination, applying two separate systems of law in the same area and basing the rights of individuals on their nationality. This regime is the only one of its kind in the world, and is reminiscent of distasteful regimes from the past, such as the Apartheid regime in South Africa.<br>  <br>  Under this regime, Israel has stolen hundreds of thousands of dunam of land from the Palestinians. Israel has used this land to establish dozens of settlements in the West Bank and to populate them with hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens. Israel prohibits the Palestinians as a group from entering and using these lands, and uses the settlements to justify numerous violations of the Palestinians’ human rights, such as the right to housing, to earn a livelihood, and the right to freedom of movement. The drastic change that Israel has made in the map of the West Bank prevents any real possibility for the establishment of an independent, viable Palestinian state as part of the Palestinians’ right to self-determination|`|A6Kslyiaaa	When the large migrations or "aliyah" began in the late 1800s, the migrating Jews purchased land from the current owners of the land(the Ottoman Turks).  When the Brittish took over, they tried 3 times to establish a 2 state solution, which, each time was agreed upon by the Jewish people living in the mandate formerly called Palestine, and rejected by all the arab nations who refused to accept it.  When the British left and gave up their mandate, the Jewish people living there had planned and announced their independence creating the Jewish state of Israel.  Now what is interesting is the Palestinian people did no such thing, they had not organized a government for themselves upon the end of the mandate, they had not drafted any documents for their independence, and they did not make any announcement to the rest of the world about their sovereignty in their land.<br>  The reason for this is that as soon as the British left, the surrounding arab nations invaded and attack the newly formed Israeli state.  The Palestinians, were waiting to a all the Jews kicked out before creating their own country.  As history shows, this plan failed miserably when Israel won the war(and without American help, yes please look that up, because it's true).<br>  After a few more wars, we snatched up some more land, including the Sinai, the West Bank, and the Golan.  The Golan will never be given back with the current state of affairs with Hezbollah and Syrian ties, there is just too much of a strategic advantage in that area.  Sinai was given back to Egypt in exchange for peace.  The West Bank was offered to Jordan in exchange for peace, but they renounced claim to the area.  This is when the large part of the palestinian resistance began.  They were cut off from any political assets so their only alternative was violence.  Israel then set up military outposts throughout the West Bank, and yes it was an occupation, to quell the remaining militant factors.  And with what has been the case with American military bases set up in occupying countries they occupied around the end of WWII, large American communities sprang up there.  As with Israel, communities formed around the military outposts in the West Bank.  I really think it's just the fault of the Palestinian people in the west bank for waiting so long to try to achieve peace.  Had it been done sooner, there wouldn't have been as much expansion around the bases, and therefore harder to pull out.<br>  There needs to be a 2 state solution, but because of all the time it has taken for the Palestinians to accept the possibility of a 2 state solution, it will take longer to negotiate what the new borders will be and how many settlements will have to be removed.|`|JyZEFStWaa	The ones in Gaza were either purchased from Arabs, or built on empty wasteland.

Jnv47zQgaa	idk but i know bondi is one|`|WKgvwCNZaa	Hmm the top 5 beaches are...<br>  <br>  <br>  1) Ka’anapali, Hawaii<br>  <br>  One of the most populated, popular best beaches in Maui, Hawaii, Ka’napali is a paradise on earth. It is located in West Maui, two miles north of the historic whaling town of Lahaina and is surrounded by numerous elegant hotels and condominiums. The beach is three miles long and is full of fun-filled activities where you can snorkel, windsurf, jet-ski, parasail and even kayak. It is divided into two separate long stretches by a massive 300 foot cinder cone Pu’u Keka’ known as the Black Rock. The rock divides the sand into two and swimmers find themselves bathing in deep water. The rugged lava coastline around the Rock is also an outstanding snorkeling spot, one of the best on the island. Swimming in the crystal clear waters is safe throughout the year but best outside the season of high winter surfs.<br>  <br>  2) Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, USA<br>  <br>  With 60 miles of pristine beach, Myrtle Beach water sports and Myrtle Beach fishing are the finest among the different beaches in America. Besides lazing and tanning in the tropical sun, the soft wide beach provides ample opportunities for swimming, surfing, parasailing, shell collecting and volleyball.<br>  <br>  Although your fun begins at the beach, the best attraction always, there is plenty more to do at Myrtle Beach. Besides beautiful beaches, it has delectable food, amusement parks, variety of shopping malls, lively nightlife and adventure sports. With hundreds of attractions, both indoors and outdoors, Myrtle Beach offers fun and excitement for all ages to enjoy.<br>  <br>  This beautiful beach resort has more than 100 professional golf courses, a NASCAR sanctioned track, minor league baseball as well as tennis. You can take a deep sea fishing adventure from eight different piers or fish the backwaters and creeks all the way from Little River to Pawley’s Island on the South Carolina coast. Moreover, there is a wildlife sanctuary where you are likely to spot alligators and deer combined with several boat tours to give you a real feel of the place. <br>  <br>  <br>  3) Cancun, Mexico<br>  <br>  Cancun is truly known as the vacation haven of the 21st century with gorgeous beaches of white sands and turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea. Having started off as a fishing village of only 120 people, Cancun is now a bustling beach resort with a population of half a million and a tourist onslaught of more than two million a year. One of Mexico’s popular and best beaches it features world class resorts, hotels, clubs and malls. It offers something for people of all ages whether it an all-day fun at the beach or an isolated, tranquil island. It is close to Miami and has a number of activities to choose from like parachuting, jet-skiing, scuba-diving and golf. Topless bathing is an accepted activity in and around the surrounding areas of Cancun.<br>  <br>  With striking modern hotels along the beach front and a lively nightlife, it is a fantastic getaway for the weary traveler. It encloses a huge lagoon, with water on both sides. Also, much of the Yucatan is easily accessible from here. There are two quite separate parts to Cancún: the zona commercial downtown which houses the shopping and residential centre and the zona hotelera - a string of hotels and tourist amenities around the Cancún Island. This is a narrow strip of sandy beach connected to the mainland at each end by causeways.<br>  <br>  4) Montego Bay, Jamaica<br>  <br>  Montego Bay is known for its long sandy stretch of bay with miles of coral reef and some of the most beautiful and best beaches in the world. Montego Bay is Jamaica’s second largest city and rests between the gently sloping hills of Bogue, Kempshot and Salem. It extends approximately ten miles from the suburban rich area of Reading at its western edge to the plush villas and resort hotels of Ironshore and Rose Hall to the east.<br>  <br>  Montego Bay is made up of two distinct parts – The Gloucester Avenue now called the Hip Strip and the city proper or the downtown.<br>  <br>  All along the coastline are beautiful luxury hotels with three main public beaches which offer all amenities and several water sports. For a quieter and tranquil atmosphere you can head to the white sandy beaches of the Caribbean Beach Park, east of the town of Ironshore.<br>  <br>  Montego Bay offers a wide variety of entertainment and sporting activities. From fun on the beach to the delicious food served at the waterfront, white water rafting and adventure sports, catamaran rides and fishing charters, it has it all. <br>  <br>  <br>  5) Phuket, Thailand<br>  <br>  Sand between your toes, stunning tropical sunsets, cold drink in your hand and warm blue inviting seas – this is picture perfect Phuket. This island is known for its silky soft beaches, superb oriental hospitality and great value accommodation. You can go diving in the Andaman Sea, golfing at championship courses or indulge in exciting eco-adventures in the tropical forest of Phuket. Take an exhilarating speedboat trip to surrounding islands or a serene.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also have to add that beaches in south-east France are really great too (Near Monaco, St-Trope) etc.|`|DYCfPgL6aa	Sentosa's Palawan Beach.|`|PC6Pm9Qzaa	1.Big Sur Beach: California, USA<br>  2.Pink Sand Beach: (Harbor Island): Bahamas<br>  3.Clifton Beach: Karachi, Pakistan<br>  4.Paracas Beach: Peru<br>  5.Boracay Beach: Philippines
10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	I really do not think so. It is only 7 degrees centigrade in Paris  today (March 7th). In April, you might be  OK with T shirts and jeans but you would be cold in that outfit, added to which, if you only wore that, you would raise a lot of eyebrows as, in France, it would be considered a seaside beach outfit and completely out of place in Paris. The French are  rather conservative in what they wear and they do not  wear  beach gear in towns. It would also immediately make you obvious as a tourist and make you identifiable to the kind of people who prey on them.

Although it is best for woman always with guardiance to protect you in any places where strangers are around. About restrictions, here, restaurants are separated so you need to watch out whether "Single(man )section" or family section.Importantly to respect others and protect yourself from sun and bad intention, you better cover yourself good simply hair and body^^face cover and glove are not nessesary.To sum up, the life in Riyadh is not very difficult as you imagine^^|`|cypZ0ykXaa	u can b a free bird in the compounds if u can afford. its safe there. but, outside its better for u accompany with yur hubby. i know some expats frm india who have suffered here. its not safe for women.|`|2573c76efdef879eda46ec9df6a90d3daa	Of course you can, but you have to be careful about some crazy guys. :)|`|LMNHj66baa	no, women need to be escorted by their husbands or another male. they also are not allowed to drive. they are not attacked in the streets and they do not wear 'tents'(pp) they wear abbyas and full hijab(over entire body, face hair hands) it's their culture and tradition. a foreigner is not required to wear it. but modest clothing is a must. it's just another culture, and no matter what they wear , people are the same everywhere. they want the same things, to provide and protect their families.|`|QiBBgOA5aa	Only if you have your husbands permission, no driving, you must wear your tent, and if you are raped than you will go to jail for it. <br>  <br>  Oppressive, I know|`|ZaxpLtJhaa	women can go out and do shopping. but women cant drive :).|`|mhYf1pgsaa	<a href="http://answersinn.andrewglynn.info" rel="nofollow">http://answersinn.andrewglynn.info</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.

My British neighbors don't pay taxes, neither do my Korean, Indian, or Russian neighbors.

But here, where there are no taxes, they pay nothing and I pay it all.<br>  <br>  The more complicated response has lots of "ifs" and "buts" (for instance, the $85,700 exemption that another person mentioned only applies to "earned income" meaning that rental income or dividends, etc. would not qualify for that exemption).<br>  <br>  P.S. That also counts for green card holders too.

kgBPU4xxaa	In order to stay here for over 90 days in any six month period, you need a visa for a valid purpose for your stay. There's visa information for Italy here: <a href="http://www.esteri.it/visti/home_eng.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.esteri.it/visti/home_eng.asp</a> which includes links to the application forms and information about the documentation you need to provide.<br>  <br>  You cannot legally stay for 90 days, leave and return for another 90 days without waiting for days. That wait would need to be entirely out of the whole Schengen area - not just here in Italy. If you overstay the legal limit, you could be banned from coming back for several years - that would also apply to the entire Schengen area and not just Italy.|`|Jm3vMKx3aa	To legally stay in Italy for longer than 90 days you would need to purchase or lease a house or an apartment in Italy and apply for a "Residenza elettiva" visa.<br>  <br>  To things like report the loss of the passport to the police and the consulate after 50 days of stay, get a new passport, travel to Croatia on your old passport and return to Italy on the new one I will not provide any comments since the question was how can I legally stay...<br>  <br>  However this present loop-hole will be closed when the "Visa Information System" gets in place and all entries/exits on e-passports are digitally scanned.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.consdetroit.esteri.it/NR/rdonlyres/36852C95-703D-4AA3-9C39-CA52460D5613/0/RESIDENCEvisa.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.consdetroit.esteri.it/NR/rdon...</a>|`|AMB8jTC2aa	I think you do that before you go

eAMbWkahaa	A working Holiday Visa is only valid for those ages 18~25 up to age 30 in some cases.<br>  <br>  Sine you are 31 you cannot get a working holiday visa.<br>  <br>  If you want a Work Visa for Japan, then you need a company that is going to hire you in Japan, and you need appropriate requirements to get the work visa sometimes it is work experience, many times it requires having a bachelors degree.  So your first job is to find a employer in Japan willing to hire you and sponsor your visa.<br>  <br>  Alternately, study and apply to some Japanese language school in Japan, and get a 1 year student visa, (valid up to two years).  31 is not too old, as when I was a language student I've met 32~38 year olds as well.  This option of course costs a lot of money!<br>  <br>  Finally you can marry your girlfriend and get a spouse visa.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Nope. You have to look for some sponsor in Japan at first.

FI916ISFaa	About $100,000 probably.  It would have to be one hell of a car to drive to Hawaii.<br>  <br>  You can't drive to Hawaii as it is a group of island in the middle of the Pacific and it is probably not feasible to drive to Alaska as you have to drive a great distance through Canada and you would need a separate visa for Canada.  Most people do not attempt the lower 48 and Alaska in the same trip.  They usually do one or the other as the Alaska Highway to get to Alaska is quite trying in itself.<br>  <br>  You can probably find a car in that range to drive the lower 48 states.  Keep in mind that it will take you many months to drive to all 48 lower states with all the expense to go along with it (gas, tolls, food, hotels or campgrounds) and these expenses will probably equal those expense again (another $5,000 to $10,000 or even more depending on where you stay at night).|`|pJieNfzOaa	It's enough for a car yes and a good car but i would suggest finding someone who knows a lot about cars not just someone trying to sell you one better yet think about renting a car...i have no idea if that's more expensive but look into it that way you don't have to bring a car back with you, just look into all the possibilities and there is always public transport lol yea i can't imagine dragging around suitcases on a bus but maybe a coach that takes a people round a couple states. <br>  Good Luck. x

It depends on the restrictions placed on the ticket which is usually determined by how heavily the ticket was discounted.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	when you missed the flight the airline cancel your reservation <br>  anyway  automatically<br>  but your ticket might still have value though|`|LqSPZbO3aa	You can't cancel a flight that has already flew.

U0vr7T6laa	In Kenya, a lot of money is being brought in due to tourism.. Everybody who has the money wants to spend thousands of US dollars to go on Safari. Kenya is a beautiful country with beautiful people. A little over a year ago, there were the presidential elections. The incumbent president was re-elected by a slim margin.<br>  <br>  The losing candidate, did not take it sitting down. He still wanted to be president. This caused conflicts between two or more tribes. That resulted in riots and over 1000 people being killed.<br>  This did cut down on tourism. Now with the economic crisis hitting the world- less travel is being done to Africa and especially Kenya.<br>  The airfares are very high at this time, since there is about a $500 to $700 fuel surcharge being imposed on each ticket coming from the US.|`|50UbJp14aa	Benefits is that you get to see a wide range of wild animals like the Lions, elephants and stuff|`|oZiCCKxfaa	I am going to Kenya too... would like the answer for the same question :)

Great nightlife, Great shops, awesome people, many different nationalities.|`|iCKkOWI7aa	i live in melbourne... its way more peacful :)|`|AAjMQtzUaa	to be honest... stay in cal, its much cheaper than melbourne and the people in cal are much nicer as well, i am in melbourne and i have lived here all my life and i am an aussie, and thats why i am moving from melb aus to california, melbourne is getting way to expensive to live, and there isnt much to do at all anymore stay in cal more to do there,|`|KZ30PZZvaa	It's great if you have mates to go places with.

Even by UK standards London is an expensive place to live.<br>  <br>  Edit: oh yeah i forgot about the weather... it's awful.|`|AA10310496	Well if you are wanting to move to London, or anywhere else in the UK or Europe, then you had better have a skill that is in high demand here because if you do not have one then your chances of getting a work permit are hovering around zero.  You see, we have this ridiculous thing called the EU, and those that have to be obeyed have decreed that citizens of the EU...or what they term as the European Economic Area... take absolute precedence over anyone else where jobs are concerned, and if you do not have a work permit you cannot get a job, and without a job you can only stay here for a maximum of six months.<br>  <br>  All the info' you would require about work permits is at this government site...<br>  <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/workingintheuk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/workin...</a>|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	If I had the money and a job lined up, I would probably do it in a heartbeat.|`|ThDr2uJBaa	you will like it if you are a far left liberal. we don't tend to like far right conservatives.|`|TcfyaI0Waa	i think it suck because you wont get to see me|`|46fouwFfaa	Go ahead but it's often cloudy and rainy in London, it can get depressing after a while. It rains so much that umbrellas are sold by the counter in just about any store, even convenience stores. The large drinks there are tiny, the streets are tiny, they mostly still use gas stoves and manual cars, the streets still have cobble stones that you can easily trip on if you're not used to uneven grounds, the cars are tiny, and the air sometimes tastes or feels very dirty or smelly. Go ahead, if you want but I think you will miss the sun the most (and actually fulfilling large meals).|`|XPqRthwraa	I moved from London to Dallas LOL. Life is much better in the USA and sure the depression is also in London. Much more expensive to live in London then here.

RYqX6N9eaa	I am not definitely sure whether Nepal is a state party to those conventions but Nepal has signed almost every conventions passed by the UN on women and children. Nepal is also doing some things that help in implementing those conventions like setting up juvenile delinquency centers to put the children so that they can improve themselves. <br>  <br>  As for the child soldier, the state does not use them and the former rebels, the Maoists had used them and some of them are in the cantonment camps where rebels are awaiting their demobilization, integration and rehabilitation. However, those who were under the age of 18 at the time of verification will not qualify for the integration in the security agencies. <br>  <br>  There are no disputes among religions in Nepal. Nepal, previously a hindu kingdom has been declared a secular country where all religions are given equal prominence. Hindus receive funds to preform worship in the temples, Buddhist do the same; Muslims are subsidized to visit Mecca for the Haj. Where holidays are given on the major festivals of each religion and other communities as well.|`|suxunLtLaa	peace is just an english word in nepal . <br>  where country's pm spreads the anti peace movements '<br>  just ask to the foreigners over there in nepal(thamel) , <br>   u will get the appropriate answer, <br>  ask business person , lower to upper every one has to give <br>  money to ???????.<br>  <br>  every day there will some strike , some movements , some thing in any part of the country .|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Topic 1 <br>  Children born in Urban Areas(middle class and even poor people) get most of the privileges a child should get.<br>  Children right is a new concept in rural areas.

It is one of the world's poorest nations, but it has abundant natural resources (like water) and beauty, a very diverse population with hundreds of ethnic groups and languages, a very religiously diverse society in which conflict between religions is rare, a fascinating history and geography, and an amazing heritage.<br>  <br>  They are currently trying to recover from a decade-long civil conflict, and are dealing with a lot of issues related to peace, so there will be a lot of material for you to use in your research. Check out some media outlets from Nepal (The Himalayan Times, <a href="http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/," rel="nofollow">http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/,</a> or eKantipur Online, <a href="http://www.kantipuronline.com/index.php," rel="nofollow">http://www.kantipuronline.com/index.php,</a> or Nepalnews.com) for information about the current political, social, and cultural issues.<br>  <br>  According to the Wikipedia article on child soldiers, "An estimated 6,000-9,000 children serve in the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) forces. Although a peace agreement is in place, the Maoists have not yet demobilized children from their ranks." You should do more research to determine what is currently being done about the child soldiers in Nepal.

ATBHG0ztaa	Avril doesn't shop at Kohls, and there isn't one in Singapore.<br>  <br>  BUT if you're looking to put together outfits that look somewhat like hers, my suggestion would be to go to Far East Plaza and browse all the shops there. The basement levels offer the greatest selection as well as that bit of Avril-like quirkiness. The prices are generally quite affordable as well.|`|7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	There is no Khol's Shop in Singapore so sorry about that.
nfu6LiVXaa	I would recommend Salzburg! Take the funicular up to Festung Hohensalzburg for super great views. Then go back to Hotel Sacher for some sacher tort and a coffee! Walk around Old Salzburg to check out the architecture and sights! If you want a lake, go check out Lake Wolfgang! <br>  <br>  Vienna is also nice, but it's much more busier with much more people and a lot more touristy things to do, so you might not feel as "relaxed" as you wish.|`|GF0mRZyYaa	Hi. I think you found your answer- I think you should go to Salzburg! It just takes you two hours by train to get there- everything is within walking distance of the train station. You' ll find a lot of nice Cafes... good restaurants and an amazing scenery (castle high above the city!)- and there are some lakes next to Salzburg!<br>  <br>  It takes you five hours to get to Vienna.... and if you don t wanna do sightseeing it's a very long way for a daytrip!|`|FpT7x2VVaa	based on what you said - Salzburg! It still has a "small town" feel to it and has lots of great cafe's and pubs.

etV271ARaa	Not yet but our economy is export driven. Our export generates58% of our GDP and companies invested overseas generate GNP. The slowdown will affect us soon coz consumption and demand is falling. <br>  <br>  Bank Negara's restrictions on overseas investments prevented local banks from buying into the US mortgage bonds and CDOs. <br>  <br>  And our KLSE didnt suffer the kind of beating as the US coz most of the foreign funds pulled out after last year's GE and especially after Anwars arrest last year. Over 33 billion RM was pulled in the 3rd qtr last year even before things started to really unwind in October. So the KLSE is being held up by local funds, EPF, Tabung Haji, PNB, Khazanah and local investors who know that the stock market is grossly undervalued. Many counters are trading below their nett asset values and its only a matter of time before the investors come back.|`|EMeAw7Bcaa	still early, wait until 3rd quarter of the year, i am sure lots of company will go bankrupt, but not so bad until bank or government go bankrupt|`|03d0cbfac12fca636244e5710c5b9bceaa	guess what?

Korea is an advanced country, so it's up to par with U.S. merchandise, etc. <br>  <br>  My advice to giving them a gift, is somthing from the heart. I'm not just saying that to be corny, but seriously, Koreans are more into thoughtful gifts, than souvenirs, etc. I mean, you could bring 'em a t-shirt with something American-related, but it would always just be a shirt, you know? <br>  <br>  Buy them an anecdote they could probably display in their house, and don't worry, they'd remember you from seeing it. Display gifts are best for Koreans, because if you decide to get them a practical gift (things they could use), they'd most likely end up forgetting who gave it to them. Koreans take practical gifts seriously, and don't let things go to waste. <br>  <br>  You could always just buy them a gift when you arrive, like a cake or something, and they'd still be pleased, don't worry. Like I said, Korean & American merchandise are just about the same, so don't try to go to great lengths to find something "authentic American". Also, just letting you know, there's a lot of better quality stuff in Korean than America, too.<br>  <br>  If you really want to just bring them something to flash, like "I'm from America", get a wall clock that says, "I love New York" or whatever. LOL. Or a Harvard tee. <br>  <br>  I'm from Vegas, so I would bring like a mini-slot machine, or poker set (not to mention, Koreans love to gamble). Or I'd get 'em a Vegas tee, or mini-Elvis/Vegas statue.<br>  <br>  Like I said, just think from the heart.

You should check out lotte world it is a very large amusement park. You should try myung dong, its a very crowded but thrilling  shopping district. You can visit the korean national buildings that are located in seoul. I think those buildings look cool becuaes they are placed in such a modern city where lights are everywhere with the old building in the middle.
VxfyQZ2jaa	Things to do in New Orleans:<br>  <br>  Mardi Gras and the Jazz Festival are world famous events, but New Orleans hosts many festivals and celebrations throughout the year:  www.nola.com/festivals<br>  <br>  The Saint Charles Streetcar is the oldest continuously operating street railway in the world and is a "tourist attraction" in its own right.  It is part of the public transit system, as are the Canal Street and Riverfront streetcar lines:  www.norta.com<br>  <br>  There is always music, but the bands change: Go to www.bestofneworleans.com and click on Music then Listings or to www.offbeat.com and click on Listings, then Music. <br>  <br>  Note that music clubs often advertise "No Cover", meaning there is no charge for entering. However, clubs with "No Cover" often require that customers buy a beverage each for every "set " of music (which can be every 20 minutes) so KNOW THE PRICE before you sit down. Clubs do that because some people will sit in the club all evening drinking nothing (clubs only make money from the drinks they sell - not from the music). It is also a good idea to pay for each round of drinks (in clubs on Bourbon Street) as it is delivered so there can't be any confusion at the end of the evening.<br>  <br>  An incomplete guide to bars & clubs:   www.neworleanscheapdrinks.com<br>  <br>  About certain alcoholic beverages:  Realize that some famous drinks are VERY potent compared with regular cocktails that have only 1 to 1 ? ounces of alcohol. For example, a Hurricane is basically 3 or 4 ounces of rum in something like red Kool-Aid, and a Hand Grenade has at least 4 ? ounces of Everclear + rum + vodka mixed with melon liquor.  They don’t necessarily taste like an alcoholic beverage and it is easy to over-indulge.<br>  <br>  Wander around the French Quarter, enjoy the architecture, watch the street entertainers (do tip), and visit some of the historic buildings that have been turned into museums (go to www.frenchquarter.com and click on Historic Attractions).<br>  <br>  Assuming the weather is good, you can collect a sandwich lunch and eat in the riverfront park (watch the shipping) or in Jackson Square (a very nice park). <br>  <br>  The Riverwalk shopping center has an air-conditioned food court with dining overlooking the river (www.riverwalkmarketplace.com).  The Canal Place shopping center is in the French Quarter and has a cinema and higher-end shopping (Saks 5th Avenue, Brooks Brothers, etc.).  Magazine Street is a miles-long shopping district: www.magazinestreet.com<br>  <br>  Louisiana is the only US state that offers tax-free shopping for international visitors:  <a href="http://www.louisianataxfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisianataxfree.com/</a><br>  <br>  The lobby for the Westin Canal Place Hotel is on the 11th floor and overlooks the French Quarter. It is a great place for an afternoon drink/snack:(www.westin.com).<br>  <br>  Cafe du Monde is in the French Quarter and you shouldn't miss having cafe au lait & beignets (www.cafedumonde.com). Another great coffee shop is the Croissant d'Or (at 615 Ursulines Street), which is open from 7:00am to 2:00pm and has food in addition to pastry. <br>  <br>  The Palm Court restaurant is very nice, has moderate prices, and offers traditional live jazz starting at 8:00pm: 1204 Decatur Street, tel 504-525-0200 (reservations are important and they are not open every day). The Palm Court is closed from about July 25th to about September 25th each year.<br>  <br>  Maximo's Italian Grill has great food and atmosphere: 1117 Decatur Street in the French Quarter, (504) 586-8883.<br>  <br>  All of the famous restaurants (Antoine's, Arnaud's, Brennan's, Commander's Palace, etc.) have reopened. The Pelican Club (on Exchange Alley in the FQ) is not as well known but is the same type experience. Reservations are a good idea, and probably essential on weekends.  Tujaques Restaurant (823 Decatur Street) is very traditional and has moderate prices:  www.tujaguesrestaurant.com<br>  <br>  Cafe Degas is a very French restaurant near City Park at 3127 Esplanade - which is not within walking distance of downtown (5 to 10 minutes by taxi). They are closed on Mondays & Tuesdays (504-945-5635).<br>  <br>  The Napoleon House restaurant is at 500 Chartres Street in the FQ, and has a menu of great local dishes:  www.napoleonhouse.com<br>  <br>  Preservation Hall has traditional live Jazz, and doesn’t serve alcohol so all ages are welcome:  www.preservationhall.com<br>  <br>  New Orleans has ballet, opera, a symphony orchestra, and theatre: <br>  <br>  www.nobadance.com<br>  www.neworleansopera.org<br>  www.lpomusic.com<br>  www.lepetittheatre.com<br>  <br>  There is a free ferry across the Mississippi at the "foot" of Canal Street. It is a short trip but like a harbor cruise w/o a guide: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_street_ferry" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_stree...</a><br>  <br>  The Aquarium, Audubon Zoo, and the new Insectarium are world-class attractions (www.auduboninstitute.org) and you should see them if you can. The Zoo is several miles from downtown. You can drive to the Zoo (which has free parking) or take public transit from the French Quarter.<br>  <br>  The Louisiana State Museum is in the French Quarter:  <a href="http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/" rel="nofollow">http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/</a>  New Orleans is also home to a number of other museums, such as the National World War II Museum (www.ddaymuseum.org) and the New Orleans Museum of Art (www.noma.org). Both can be reached by public transit: The WWII museum is in the central business district but a long walk from the French Quarter. NOMA is not within walking distance of downtown but has free parking.  Go to www.neworleansmuseums.com for info on more museums.<br>  <br>  Harrah’s Casino is in the Central Business District: www.harrahs.com  (age 21 required for entry)<br>  <br>  New Orleans City Park has a variety of attractions + free parking.

zyUfLvF5aa	yes, all of the DISNEY resorts provide free transportation to and from parks, water parks/ mini golf, downtown disney, and back to your resort. You have nothing to worry about when it comes to transportation, you just have to wait for the bus, which can take a while. There are many different kinds of transportation, depending on the resort. All of the resorts have bus transportation to and from everything I mentioned above. Some resorts, such as Old Key West, have boat transportation to downtown disney, along with the bus transport. If you are staying at one of the Magic Kingdom Resorts, Grand Floridian, Poly, or Contemporary, there is also the monorail survive to and from Epcot, the Magic Kingdom, TTC (Transportation and Ticket Center), and the three resorts mentioned above. I find rental cars are nice though, especially if staying for over a week. Waiting for the bus all of the time can take up a lot of time in your day. Plus, if you have a rental car, and you are staying at one of the Disney World resorts, you are able to get free parking, as long as you are staying on property, otherwise the price is $12 to park for a full day, at any park. All you have to pay for is the rental car itself. Disney does a wonderful job of keeping  up with coustomer transportation around Disney World. If you are going, I suggest Old Key West resort, which has the old home-like feel of Key West, put into a Disney hotel. If you get the one bedroom, you can fit about 5 people into the room, there is a pull out couch, and one regular king-size bed, a full kitchen, a full bathroom, and laundry services right in your room. All along with a outdoor padio. I always stay here, and it is not that expensive, but a moderate price resort. If you are going, I hope you have a magical and wonderful trip to the most magical place on earth, Walt Disney World!|`|LsAArkUyaa	Not only does WDW offer free transportation from their resorts to the parks, but most Orlando hotels do also.<br>  However the transportation from non Disney hotels is not managed through WDW, therefore WDW is not responsible for the reliability or lack thereof.|`|3w3Ke4pjaa	All Disney resorts give your transportation around the Walt Disney World Resort and to your hotel from Orlando International Airport free. <br>  <br>  Here are some other benefits of staying on Disney Property:<br>  <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/res..." rel="nofollow">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/res...</a>|`|Aw6nZ4wWaa	Yes they do!!

For the deluxe resorts they offer the busses and either transporation by boat or monorail. For the moderates and the values resorts, all of the transporation is offered through their bus system. <br>  <br>  They also offer a free bus transporation to and from the airport but you have to sign up for it two weeks ahead of time.

If you are going further out to  Mustang Island or Aransas to the beach get ready to wait in line. The usual commute is about 10 minutes but during Spring Break you are going to sit in your car about an hour or better waiting to get to the beach. Please believe me it gets and stays crowded out that way. A lot ( AND I DO MEAN A LOT !!!!) of spring breakers go out there to the beach. The beach is fun but the water is ALWAYS full of sea weeds and sometimes jellyfish so be ready for that. If you are trying to avoid that the best beach is downtown off of Shoreline Blvd and Ocean Drive not as crowded, fewer sea weed and many places close by to eat after wards. Good luck hope you have fun....|`|AA11114814	More than likely,  Corpus will not be terrible but Port Aransas will be packed.

Job less people outside the country of original face hardship and frustration.<br>  <br>  The cost of living in Denmark is considerably higher than in the United States. ... so you have to be careful.<br>  <br>  The cost of living in Denmark is very high; it is the third most expensive in the world, according to a survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Eating out, accommodation, transport and groceries are all very expensive; however, salaries are also high in Denmark compared with many other countries, and many welfare services are provided free of charge. <br>  <br>  Typical prices include: <br>  <br>  1 litre of milk DKK7.00<br>  Loaf of bread DKK10.00<br>  Small bottle of beer DKK6.00<br>  Typical low cost meal DKK50.00<br>  Typical high cost meal DKK175.00<br>  <br>  Rental prices vary widely depending on location and type of property. On average, monthly rents for apartments range from DKK 6,000 to DKK 25,000 and for houses from DKK10,000 to DKK 40,000. Utilities costs are usually excluded from the rent.
g2x6BP7Xaa	I travel a lot so here are my tips.<br>  Don't buy a wheeled suitcase as the centre of gravity is bad so they tend to want to tip over. Better to buy a wheeled, expandable carrier with a retractable handle that your hand baggage can attach to.<br>  You can get these sets from any cheap luggage shop on your local High Street. But be warned that the wheels are of very poor construction and will break before the rest of the bag.<br>  After going through a few of these sets myself I upgraded to "Kipling" luggage which is beautifully made, especially for women and very strong. It's about ￡100-￡150 for a large carrier and ￡60-90 for a matching attachable carry on but worth every penny. Go to <a href="http://www.kipling.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.kipling.com</a> to shop online or to find your nearest stockist.<br>  Failing that try Marks and Spencer, Debenhams and TK Maxx for good quality luggage and at least you can try it out there.|`|AuvMZYTSaa	With luggage, you get what you pay for so it would be better to pay for premium luggage up front rather than buying several cheap ones.<br>  <br>  Travelpro makes very good luggage|`|PC6SC6jyaa	Well, I have bought both the cheap luggage in supermarkets and the expensive branded ones from department stores. <br>  <br>  The expensive ones will break eventually. After all, a handle can only take so many throws! Likewise with the wheels!<br>  <br>  But the cheap and cheerful ￡20 ones do the job very well. And if they break (surprisingly they last a long time) buy another cheap one. <br>  <br>  You see all these people with old Samsonite suitcases from 1985 which look so shabby and tatty; and then compare it to my ￡20 one and I am the one laughing at them! <br>  <br>  I bought mine from Asda, and since 2007 and 20 trips later; it still hasn't broken! My parents have used Samsonite bags, and although they are good. What do you do when the wheels and handles break?

f8accf9d2c8b11a0f3db34e06a24eb13aa	I have lived in Kenya for most of my life and I can honestly say that precaution is important but fun is inevitable. <br>  <br>  As you rightfully say, with kenya being in the tropics, there are diseases such as Malaria that you have to protect yourself against. You need to take the malaria jab and you will be ok. <br>  <br>  Also dont wear fancy or any jewerly for that matter when walking on the streets. Dont use your phone, video cam etc when walking in the streets. Keep your wallet deep in your pocket etc.<br>  <br>  Best thing is to keep to a group of people. Dont walk alone etc. Avoid beach boys when in the beach in mombasa. <br>  <br>  But all in all, you will be in for a great treat in Kenya. Its an all round experience. Read more on what I think about Kenya on <a href="http://www.my-kenya-guide.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-kenya-guide.com</a>|`|fbe100783d158b95b5df42a0c4ba0fcbaa	i was on safari in September, I absolutely loved Kenya. The people in general are helpful and curtius. I met a few indigenous people (Sumbura and Masai) that are very proud of there lifestyles.<br>  Keep in mind that the coastal region is predominantly Muslim, so respect that faith by dressing modestly. As far as health concerns, have all suggested shots and bring mosquito repellent with DEET. All of our lodges supplied repellents, but you never know.<br>  Be respectful and kind and treat people like you like to be treated and it will be a trip of a lifetime. It recharged my soul.<br>  Enjoy.|`|AA11043094	I loved Kenya but you have to be careful. The beaches can be dangerous. Stay with a group or near your resort. If you decide to safari then use a safari service, it will cost more that doing it yourself but far safer. Eat only freshly cooked food! Drink ony bottled water!   Have fun!!|`|50UbJp14aa	I am originally from Kenya, mombasa is a good place, i went there like twice to the beaches, had a good experience.|`|RILZcr6Daa	There is no yellow fever in Nairobi except the north eastern  and north rift valley which have isolated cases of yellow fever of which you wont be visiting.malaria  is a common disease in the equatorila but with simple precaution of a mosquito net you can avoid it.Otherwise kenya is a great place to visit and stay
xIHgTqVhaa	I'm afraid not. <br>  <br>  I had to pay $100 excess baggage when I moved out of Hong Kong. I was really kicking myself because I when I had the rest of my things shipped (paid for by the company), I hadn't used up the whole allowance. So not only was I hauling more stuff than I needed to through the airport but I got to pay extra for doing so.<br>  <br>  Don't make my mistake and if this is a paid move, ship as much as you can. Pack and ship whatever you don't need in the next few weeks.<br>  <br>  Another tip, if you are a family and you have a child under age 2, get him or her a seat and this will give you the baggage allowance for an adult. Kids over 2 also get the same allowance as adults. <br>  <br>  Make sure all your bags are equal otherwise, you'll be charged for the heaviest one. Also, if your bags are just over, they might give you a break. Be nice to them at check in. Don't hide anything or lie but you don't need to point it out! (An agent is more willing to let it slide if you don't annouce it to his colleguecolleagueshaps a supervisor nearby that you're over your limit).<br>  <br>  I hate moving, especially, so good luck!|`|3AMaOT7Naa	No ways!

TB2i7xiYaa	a friendly competition is when competitors share a round of beer after a game of basketball. in the court, we give our all by pushing and shoving opponents. outside the court we push and shove in jest and in amusement.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	The term "friendly competition" means that in a competition, both parties simply stick to the rules and that they respect each other. That's it - the term doesn't imply that both parties are friends, since by virtue of common sense, all competition is technically rivalry in its pure and simplest form   :D|`|z5fFoTMBaa	Hmmm... a rivalry between friends?<br>  <br>  I think it's recognizing who the winner is and accepting the results. The term "friendly competition" would only apply to a contest before and after.

Without competition, we may not be as motivated to do our very best.|`|Imqb5ueqaa	There is, if both agree to the rules. But if only one is friendly, and the other wants a bloody battle, then it is war.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	most sports are considered friendly competition... as long as there is sportsmanship and fairness...|`|dnH339elaa	Whether we are aware of it or not, we have been competing since birth.  As children, we compete with our siblings for attention from our parents.  In schools, we compete with our peers for academic or athletic excellence.  In the job market, we continue to compete for lucrative pay and position.  It is that competitive spirit that keeps us going and going.  Survival of the fittest!  Darwin's theory, remember?<br>  <br>  But through all these, we do not kill each other nor ourselves.  It is because we abide by the rules of engagement.  Definitely, we are all in friendly competition with one other.<br>  <br>  It is when we go for blood that competition turns sour.  But then again, we are not savages.  Thank God!|`|eDjiOWKtaa	of course there is. the whole point of competition is to find out who's better in a particular action on a given time. rivalries are inevitable because there's always someone who wants to be the best and they'll only know it once they've competed with everyone else who thinks they're the best.<br>  <br>  "friendly competition" happens when there's a degree of respect that exists when competing against someone even if its a rival. the respect is such that learning from a competitor's strengths and weaknesses brings out the best in someone by making them learn more about their own strenghts and weaknesses.<br>  <br>  it shouldn't be a big deal if competing causes a rivalry to emerge. so what? that's the problem with most people. they don't want to give their best because they're afraid of competing against anyone, they don't want to compete against anyone because of a lame excuse that it causes a rivalry.<br>  <br>  how we deal with life's challenges is reflected in our attitude towards something as trivial as competition. this doesn't just apply in sports or business, but in everyday life. it's just sad that a lot of people think of competition as something that breeds arrogance or brutality instead of confidence or passion.|`|K6QlFoo0aa	My thesis adviser and I were great friends.  We played highly competitive games of table tennis (ping-pong) at a very high level all of the time.  Of course we competed hard - I was a slammer and he was a defensive player.  Trying to get a slam past him was very difficult and sometimes quite frustrating.  When I was really on I won, otherwise I lost.  But we were always friends.  And we never were mad at at one another.<br>  <br>  Note:  There were three table tennis courts in the basement of the Math Department Building so we really didn't have to travel very far.  Otherwise we would never have played as much as we did.<br>  <br>  We also competed at golf and twenty questions in our area of mathematics.  No biggie.  We played 20 questions in the coffee room and attracted lots of professors who came to watch and learn. lol.  No problems at that either.  Actually we were both too good to fail to answer a question.  Neither of us could dream up a question that the other couldn't get.  We probably should have played 10 questions.|`|PgvwnEpMaa	friendly competition is healthy. gives important lesson about sportsmanship. <br>  <br>  competition that makes us want to win win win by any means is bad. thats why steroids are ban.
BJ0kC81saa	I live in Adelaide. It was a planned town, therefore all the streets are in a grid like Fashion. Consequent;ly it's extremely easy to drive and navigate around Adelaide. <br>  <br>  The traffic is extremely light compared to places like Sydney. <br>  <br>  Speeding cameras are a pain. Unlike the other states signs are put up about 20m AFTER the actual speeding camera, saying you've passed one. <br>  I'm not to sure about courtesy, I've never driven anywhere else. It seems pretty good to me, I've never been yelled at or had the finger being held up to me. <br>  <br>  At the moment their doing a lot of roadwork at the South Road and ANZAC highway intersection, but that should be over fairly soon. Other than that there are no major roadworks.<br>  <br>  As for the driving skills about tailgating etc. I can't really be a judge as I've only had my license for about a year so haven't really experienced driving in other cities, therefore I can't compare. I haven't come across many bad drivers, they do exist, but I only come across them rarely. I have heard from others that Adelaide drivers are generally calmer and their aren't as many tailgaters and weavers etc as in other cities.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Likst1Mxaa	I think adelaide is relaxed compared to driving in other cities. Depends where you have lived before, adelaide's planned so all our roads are pretty easy to follow. I moved here from a country town and to be honest drivers here are more courteous and less likely to drag you off at traffic lights than they would in a town.<br>  <br>  If you don't drive in "peak hour" then waiting at lights is a non-issue. At all costs avoid turning right at major intersections, sometimes it's easier to do a u-turn and turn left.<br>  <br>  TAXIS are the bane of my existance in Adelaide. Most of them can't drive and cut into/block traffic.<br>  <br>  Also: speed cameras are there to SAVE LIVES. After being in a serious car accident and knowing people who have died in them, anything which lowers the road toll is fine with me. if you don't speed then cameras ARE NOT an issue. If you have a GPS it should tell you speed camera locations anyway.

Rs2gyFeUaa	I live in Portugal and can honestly recommend Madrid!  As the tourist season approaches, here, you can expect prices to skyrocket!!  And, normally, double! There was a time when it was cheap to live here- that's why I came- but, now, the cost of living is ridiculous! The villages are the friendliest, though: don't expect the cities concern themselves greatly with scamming tourists- English, Dutch, French, etc. The best place in Portugal is the Alentejo. Here, you can expect a great degree of courtesy and fairness and, in my opinion, these likeable people truly represent the Portuguese character!|`|QKfD6MYmaa	Unsure on prices, but my brother and his girlfriend went to Portugal. The people were very nice, and surroundings were great, and I do believe everything was pretty cheap.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	Relatively speaking, Portugal is cheaper than Spain.. but neither are cheap.

6aJn2Gjuaa	yes I live where the epicentre was, in Korumburra. It was quite frightening till I realised what it was. This was 9pm. Everything shook violently. We had further tremors over the next hour every few minutes then another one at 3am then another at 10am. Both woke me. It was a loud crack then massive movement. I thought at first a light plane had crashed into the house because we get a few in our path. Quite the experience.|`|KZ30PZZvaa	yep.

e90176c07b1407c7ff422c7f67eba392aa	Most apartments in Dubai are rented long term, and without furniture. Short term leases tend to be MUCH more expensive. I think for $2000, you can find a decent 2 BR apartment, unfurnished, if you want to rent for a year. Even then, you might have to bargain for it. You'd probably end up with an apartment in "International City" or "Discovery Gardens". Discover Gardens is arguably nicer, but less developed and further from the old heart of Dubai.<br>  <br>  In fact, I'd have to say that it would be difficult to find a 2 BR in Dubai that is furnished for that price. Just a quick look on the internet now and I found 10 2BR apartments that were in or just above your price range, but none were furnished. And I'd imagine that you'd have to have a 1 year lease with prepaid checks for a year (in Dubai, typically you give post dated checks for a year in advance and if you skip out, it's a criminal offense).<br>  <br>  However, with the current economic climate, there may be more people willing to bargain. (I myself have a couple of apartments to rent - sorry only studios - and I have been forced to lower my expectations).<br>  <br>  Check out "Better Homes" real estate company in Dubai.

f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Climate of oppression. Why not ban marches and continue to ignore discrimination and oppression if you are in power? All oppressive regimes do this type of thing to maintain control. <br>  <br>  The marches were about civil (equal) rights for an oppressed minority, the Catholic population, who were being harassed and discriminated against for housing and employment. Catholics were underrepresented politically, arrested and held without charge and were also subject to violence by Unionist groups and the police. Very similar to the treatment of African Americans of the US Southern states during the US civil rights movement. The US southern state governments also banned civil rights marches ...and jailed Martin Luther King for marching anyway. <br>  <br>  Banning marches or protest only makes things worse in the end. Repression just increases the pressure until there is violence.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The website I attached is an excellent resource for information on this topic|`|sOi98doYaa	Common sense really.

PA0bGBtCaa	For security reasons, you can't do job shadowing. Ground crew for an airline doesn't pay a lot to start off. You can look to start making about $10 - $12 an hour and top out at $25 after like 10 years. Flight attendants pay more, but you're stuck doing the same routine over and over. Sure you get pay raises, but job growth isn't there. Plus if you have no seniority in the airline world, you tend to get cut first when the economy slows. Right now is not the time to want to work for an airline.|`|R40lLWl3aa	Air Traffic Controller<br>  <br>  They are hiring like crazy because of all the controllers that are qualifying for retirement or that have already retired.

gYYGyYUAaa	COME HERE NOW!!! Everyone will love you from the get-go because of your accent.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ok, now let me actually answer your question.<br>  <br>  You will very likely not be made fun of, girls will love you, but the guys will find you a bit odd, but they won't make fun of you. It's partly because of the words English people use that most Americans would never use in an everyday converstaion, like "lovely", "quite", or "brilliant", so because of that, the most ridicule you might get is being called gay. The guys in America are much more insecure, lol, about their masculinity. A lot of them act all tough and there are many "gangters" here, lol, (atleast in New York). I haven't really lived anywhere but New York my entire life, but I have visted a few states in the south. The people there seem more conservative, much different than New York, so I don't know how interested you are in that, but they certainly are very hospitable. In New York, everyone sort of keeps to themselves. The weather is different everywhere, you'll find weather you prefer in any state. In New York, we get all four seasons and it is cloudy and it does rain a lot, but probably not as much as it does in England. We also get some of the coldest winters and the hottest summers.<br>  <br>  I'm in High school right now, and that consists of four years, 9th(freshman), 10th(sophmore), 11th(junior), and 12th(senior). The schools are just like you'd probably expect, nothing special, probably just like the UK. There are class periods, lunch periods, electives, clubs...pretty much something for everyone. My school is huge, with many students, so no one really stands out, no one really cares, lol. <br>  <br>  I think you'll like it here, I might be a bit biased here, but I'd say, especially if you're only here for a little while, that the best place for you to visit is New York. There's everything here, suburbs, big cities (manhattan!!), interesting people, and you won't be bored.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|X6rFPI2laa	There are rude people everywhere on earth, but no more so in the US than other places.  I think you will find that you will NOT be made fun of, and that people will be enchanted with your English accent, as well as very curious about your life at home.  I think you'll find that most folks are pretty nice and will enjoy making friends so long as you are open to friendship (which I assume you are!).  This is a HUGE country, so the climate and weather can be anything.  As to the schools, if you watch movies you will get a general idea of the atmosphere.  There really isn't a best or worst place -- what is best for you will be worst for somebody else, and vice versa.  If you will have some choices, so some research about various areas, states, and cities -- there's a lot of very good information even about small towns on the internet!|`|hCaotAlCaa	Star is right - if you have any rap at all, girls will hit on you.  Start with that because for the most part, no one else will pay much attention to you one way or another.  At least not in the bigger cities.  If you are out in some country location, people might find your presence unusual and kind of exciting.  <br>  <br>  No one will dislike you because you are English, though most people here can't tell by your accent if you are English or Australian.  Some would not even be able to recognize an Irish or Scottish accent either.<br>  <br>  Schools and weather, you need more specifics - this is a big place and weather can be anything from tropical to arctic.  If you can say what specific school or schools you are considering, you can get pretty good information.|`|0KDOSIJPaa	I dont think you'll be made fun of, maybe a couple of kinds will be mean but there is that chance anyway isn't there. Plus everyone here loves an english accent(girls especially will find it cute and mature). At my school we do an exchange program with england where they stay at your house for a week and then you stay at there's for a week, everyone always gets along really well. As to where to go i would suggest somewhere similar to where you live now, at least if you live in the city now you should probably go to Boston. If you live in the country a big city like NYC might not be the best idea. The weather here varies greatly on where you are going if you go to florida its in the 80s  like all year if you go to maine you have mildly warm summers and four feet of snow every winter.<br>  hope i helped|`|yUyx2nhmaa	They will all want to bed you because of your classy accent...this made me laugh because I have a common as muck geordie accent.<br>  <br>  Go to the west coast - it's a bit more liberal...the east is very conservative. I didn't enjoy it personally. I found it very insular. It's very hard to find out what's going on in the rest of the world...'we have enough news of our own' was a typical response i got. The only international news was from countries where they had sent troops.|`|847a6e5aa5c40606588dea148698eed2aa	the english?<br>  <br>  they are overrated.|`|2Cn1UFrpaa	Go to New york city, the cultural mixture will show you what america is ALL about.<br>  I find english boys very finee personally,, but then again english people often come off as ride because they complain about how annoying america is and it gets annoying..<br>  also they think europe os so much better and make us feel like we are the rude ones
PA0bGBtCaa	You just answered your own question. It's cheaper to fly during the week because the demand is not that high. Basically an airplane is broken down into multiple little quadrants. Each quadrant is a "fare class." When the demand is high, the cheapest fare classes are bought up first. There's no timeline on how long that takes. When you look online as in your example, you're seeing the planes that are still selling the cheaper fares. The 1570 pounds is a flight where the demand is really high! <br>  <br>  The cheaper fares are also not flexible. Meaning you can't cancel them, and you can't make name changes if you screw up and mispell your name booking it online. There are two things you don't ever talk about while on an airplane. One: Bombs...For obvious reasons. Two: How much you paid for your ticket. The guy next to you could have paid 2,000 pounds for that coach seat next to you while you bought it early and scooped up a sale fare for 300 pounds. <br>  <br>  Flying on Friday the 13th is just a ridiculous myth. It depends on the season when the day falls on. Every country has its own peaks and valleys in travel seasons, so that is the driving force. The same applies to New Year's. Though generally flying on December 31 at night time is a good time to fly as most people are already at their destinations.|`|NePxlTnZaa	The simple economics of supply and demand.|`|303ad4812dd354d0dd82b4670e9406c8aa	the amount of usage - a plane makes money by the number of passengers it carries - not the number of flights it makes|`|WA7UsDRSaa	Because there is many different Economy class fares!<br>  <br>  Buy your ticket from travel agent,not online <br>  <br>  If you want a lowest fare!
eD7qRBKHaa	Disney World (4 parks), Universal Studios (2 parks), and Sea World are the main theme parks in Orlando.  And there are also several water parks.

H0MFNydyaa	If you're looking for a place to simply relax and enjoy the beauty of nature, your search is over because Vermont, the Green Mountain state, is the place you're looking for. There are a lot of fun things to do with the help of Mother Nature's resources. Go skiing or snowboarding on one of the many snow-covered mountains in the Winter, or enjoy favorite pastimes in the Summer such as hiking, biking, fishing, or paddling and of course playing a round of golf on smoothly groomed hillsides can be enjoyed throughout the state in the Spring, Summer, and Fall. Join other "leaf-peepers" to gaze in wonder at the brilliant colors during Fall Foliage season.|`|pJieNfzOaa	Depending on age i would say Vermont if you're more older and Florida if your younger so like disney world or something like that. Also the weather depending when your going. If you think they are both beautiful places that your going then if you're going with someone get them to pick if not pick the cheapest one. I would pick Vermont as it looks prettier but i think you should pick. Where has more things to do?|`|ox85tnblaa	Which do you prefer: Waterski-ing , sunshine, shorts and sandals.<br>    Or Shovelling a pathe to get to where you think you left you car because you can no longer see it. Hoping that it will start cuz theres always a chance that it's froze solid-of course that depends on if you can get the frozen lock to turn and the door pried open after yo chip away at the cocoon of ice that has formed around it half an inch thick. Hoping that the streets you need to drive on have been plowed and that other drivers remember how to drive in such conditions. And the wildlife that is beautiful until it darts out in front of your car totaling it and four others before popping up and running back into the woods.  <br>  So really it is that simple.|`|BjS8k8Cyaa	Vermont is so beautiful.

Over and over and over. That's the best way.

Don't be scared of kanji, learn them! and it's a good idea to learn one vocab word that uses a reading of the kanji.

Keep doing what your doing. I suggest to make flash cards so you can recognize  the kanji. Also you should learn about the back stories of the Kanji ( if they have one), it helps you to unterstand and remember them easier. Are you studying Japanese or Chinese?|`|DoYQeqGhaa	I learned by flash cards with a mnemonic on the back now, i never forget them|`|j1Yae2q9aa	I learned my kana using mneumonics...  The way I learned a lot of my kanji was back when Jappleng has this killer app.  It was a flash card type of game and you would go through 10 Kanji.  First you would be presented with each of them individually and were asked to just try to memorize it and a few seconds later it would go to the next one and so on until you got to 10.  At that point, it would start quizzing you in a random order, and if you got one wrong, it would ask you again in a random order twice.  So if you missed the same one 4 times, you had to do it 8 times.  So a simple 10 question kanji test would end up being 30 or something.  In the end though, you would be surprised just how well your RECOGNITION for the kanji was.  <br>  <br>  But that wasn't all that you had to do.  Afterwards you had to move on to the next 10 set and do it.  Then you went back to your first set of 10 and had to practice writing it.  Then it would ask you to write it on paper and then flip the cards over and you had to pick the right one (like you used to in the quiz) and pick the right answer.  It'll ask you if you if you had it written down right and if you did you clicked YES if not you clicked NO and had to re-do it later on 2 more times until you got it.<br>  <br>  At the end, you would have to do the same for the second set of 10 and by the end you would have learned 20 kanji in about 30 minutes (on or kun reading but not both).  You could also go to "test mode" and it'll time you with the kanji that you practiced and you had to answer each one within a few seconds. Practice mode had kanji in sentences with or without kana.  I got until level 3 using their method but they took it down for site "renovation".  So right now their completely remaking the website.  It was fun, easy, and free.  They were by far the best (I think) to learn kanji let alone Japanese with.

While they go through the leftover bags, because your bag would have been an extra bag on the flight, an airline staff member needs to be down in the Customs area to claim it. If the airline has an agent who does not know the bag is arriving, thent hey may depart the customs area before it's searched. When that happens, then Customs usually holds on to the bag. Most times they just destroy the bag. I've seen this a lot.

Atlanta has the worst commute in all the cities I've been in.<br>  <br>  downtown isn't really a good place to live. that's probably the most "unsafe" place to live. the suburbs in Fulton County are really affluent and somewhere you could look into.<br>  <br>  living "Inside the Perimeter" (area within our 3 major highways), is worth its costs. we have a MARTA system which is like the BART in Northern California or the New York City Subway. make sure you're very accessible to the exits by the MARTA stations placed along the highway.<br>  <br>  cities to look into (mostly in Fulton County):<br>  Alpharetta<br>  College Park<br>  Duluth<br>  Johns Creek<br>  Milton<br>  Roswell<br>  Sandy Springs<br>  <br>  for an even lower cost of living, look into places in Forsyth or Gwinnett county, which are just as safe.<br>  <br>  as for schools, any county in Metro Atlanta has top rated schools except Clayton County, which recently lost accreditation.<br>  <br>  finding a house shouldn't be too hard, honestly. so many homes have been foreclosed. these homes are put up for much less than the original price. it's sad seeing it all happen, but it's how it is.|`|TbiSBXclaa	The best schools are in Cobb, Gwinett and North Fulton County.  Consequently so are the best neighborhoods.<br>  <br>  Anything in East Cobb County, Anything in North Fulton County anything in North Gwinett will be the places you'll want to concentrate on. <br>  <br>  Check out a map of the Atlanta area. You'll want to look in the area north of the Perimeter Highway (I-285 circles the city) between I-75 to the northwest and I-85 to the northeast. <br>  <br>  Of course there are other good areas but the highest conentration of top performing public schools and excellent neighborhoods will be in that area.|`|ewd9n2lRaa	I would say Sandy Springs, Alpharetta, most parts of Marietta, Vinings.<br>  <br>  I would make sure you already have a job before you move here because our unemployment rate is higher than the national average at this time.  So if you aren't transfering here for a job you currently have I would not move here until you secure employment.  Other than that good luck.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	Kennesaw is good. Parts of Marietta (around Kennesaw) are good. (You do have to check more on Marietta b/c as you get close to Austell it starts getting kinda nasty) Parts of acworth are good (again close around Kennesaw) THe drawback there though is the traffic. It can be pretty bad at times. But it's overall a nice area to live in. I liked living there and was happy with the school my son went to.|`|L9XS5Gqgaa	Not Carrollton, Ga.  It's hot, boring and the people are ignorant. I had to put my things in storage, pack the car and drive as fast as I could 1,000 miles away just to keep my sanity.  I would go with one of the other answers as I think this is triggering a PTSD attack just thinking about Carrollton Ga.|`|kAuGqzPvaa	Kennasaw is good.  Marietta  and Dunwoody as well.|`|gcraELD4aa	DEFINATELY!!!!!!!!! Fayetteville GA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its only about 10 Min Away from the airport.|`|0orf8HJIaa	stay out of fulton county for sure, gwinnett is very nice.(norcross, lawrenceville, snelville areas)

KVlRYoidaa	sex with the stewardess is encourage.|`|d882dfb556981cb3af4f55a8e9b82fbfaa	Characteristics of SIA<br>  <br>  1.Great way to fly<br>  2. Safe In Air<br>  3. Sexy In Appearance<br>  4. Satisfaction In Aviation|`|ATBHG0ztaa	Amazing service. They are the best airline I have ever flown with. The stewardesses will do anything that they can to accomodate you during the flight, not to mention, they are all gorgeous women. The food is good too. I have never liked airline food, but their food is quite delicious. I would generally eat every bite on the tray. Their in-flight entertainment selection is great as well.|`|7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	They tend to give the best and they are always go for the newest and the popular ones. They want to be top of the notches as compared to others, due to the survivor of the airline that belongs to one of the smallest nation in world. This is utmost important to them.|`|7j0LhVmJaa	Uniquely Singapore is always the target.|`|wgQ8snGiaa	They are very disciplined and strict (with themselves).
9TE9lOKBaa	;D I live there.<br>  im pretty sure you're husband will find work, especially at a construction maintenance person.<br>  but don't look for factory jobs, they're all moving to mexico.
urHPuzMsaa	I do not know of a Premier Inn here in Las Vegas. However the minimum age is 18 and some are 21 and over. You have to be 18 to be held responsible for any damages to the room that you may cause. If you are under 18 then you couldn't be held responsible and your parents would be. Yet if they didn't rent the room the hotel would be responsible for renting to a minor. You must be show ID and Credit card when checking in and they must match.|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	YES 18 and with proper ID|`|AA10535892	not normally no, but maybe you may have to have a credit card to put down as a deposit, that would depend on the hotel I Guess?<br>  depending on the hotel also they can get a little security concious regarding how many people are in the room verses how many are booked in the room!|`|mldo1vxYaa	In Vegas most decent hotels you have to be 21 or someone in the room has to be at least 21. Also you have to show a credit card and ID upon check in and they have to match.|`|NPbIgn8Jaa	Nope, there isn't such a rule. I mean, why would hotels be bothered about your age? So long as you have the money, they would give you a room if there is!|`|d2ef8cb021560ac7c67c4c024319ac86aa	yes, you do have to be over 18, or be accompanied by someone over 18. In doubt they could request a passport, ID, etc

WpqwaqcQaa	it's expensive, your best bet is to call around and get a few estimates.<br>  <br>  a lot depends on the permits and licenses you'll need and how much labor they need to do on site(s).<br>  <br>  here is one example: <br>  <br>  It cost us $3000 plus a generous tip for them to break down the plumbing, jack it up and remove the supporting blocks, attach the hitch, fix 2 axles, put tires on the axles, put safety lights on the back, transport it with 2 guide trucks and a crew of 5 men, get it onto the property and slab (that was a feat, because the pivoting of the axles wasn't tight and it took him 4 careful hours and a special hydraulic tow hitch to move the 66 ft. trailer back and forth, up and down, eight inches at a time in order to get it up the 35 ft. wide driveway, lined with trees!) Then they have to hook up the electric, plumbing, sewer, jack it up, put and level supporting blocks, install huricane tie-downs and remove the tires, safety lights, and hitch. They were worth every dime! We did our own skirting. Wasn't hard at all, as long as you are on a concrete pad. We were living in it in a park and wanted it moved to our own land. It looks better now that it's set right this time|`|EiX4L2xQaa	i would say $3,000.00
g8LLIeXKaa	Anywhere is great basically just as long as they do not have a camera restriction. This way, your camera isn't taken or you are left outside and loose the money (if any) you paid to visit.<br>  <br>  Since the terror attacks on 9/11 most places have or is enforcing the following:<br>  <br>  1. No Cameras - No camera (photo or video) of any kind are permitted.<br>  2. No Flash - The use of flash is permitted.<br>  3. No Lens - The use of telephoto or zoom lenses are restricted.<br>  4. No Lights - The use of external or internal lights are restricted.<br>  5. No Tripods - The use of a tripod is restricted.<br>  6. No Video Cam - The use of cameras that takes video are restricted<br>  7. No Audio - The use of cameras that records sound are restricted.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://411newyork.org/guide/2008/09/11/camera-restrictions-in-new-york/" rel="nofollow">http://411newyork.org/guide/2008/09/11/c...</a><br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://411newyork.org/" rel="nofollow">http://411newyork.org/</a>|`|9f74caaf5c144aedc435309558b06d0eaa	Like other people said, the Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center) and Empire State Building. However, both cost money. A cheaper solution is to go to the pedestrian plaza in the middle of Times Square. There you can take pictures of all the flashing neon lights. Another great spot is the Staten Island Ferry. From the ferry you can get excellent shots of Manhattan.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	I got some great pics of the city from the top of the Empire State Bldg and some terrific pics of Central Park from Top of the Rock.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	go up the Chrysler or empire state to take cool views.
DGINTA4Saa	If the bags were lost you should call up the airport in the U.S that you used to get to Rome and check if they didn't misplace your bag.|`|X6rFPI2laa	How unfortunate for you!  I hope you had identification inside the bag, too, because sometimes outside tags get torn off or lost, and the folks will open those bags to try to identify the owner.  You made a report at the "lost luggage" office, I hope!  If you made a report and if your bag can be identified, they will get it to you.  Best of luck!|`|caLIvhdzaa	u should have complained about missing bag in airport itself, in fact i had lost my bag after complaining i came to know they had loaded my baggage into another aircraft which reached airport later in the night, but the airport people were so sweet, they landed my baggage to the hotel were i was staying. (but the bag was damaged badly)|`|CLndtRtPaa	Go to the baggage office. Remain calm.
kgBPU4xxaa	There are a lot of places I'd like to go that I haven't visited yet. However, I think the first place on my list if I had the time would be Iguazu Falls <a href="http://www.shieldsaroundtheworld.com/g_a..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shieldsaroundtheworld.com/g_a...</a> I particularly like waterfalls and have made several trips specifically to see various falls such as Gullfoss in Iceland and have never been to South America.<br>  <br>  Basically here you can admire the scenery and get a lot of great photos. <br>  <br>  Toward the end of April, the Netherlands is a great destination. The tulips will be at their peak and there are hundreds of interesting museums, art galleries, and events in the country then. I go every year.
bwygouP8aa	Check these out.|`|ze4Gt1araa	Well South Beach do sell Brazilian clothes you can try Ocean Drive and well reguarding to club you can try:<br>   <br>  - Atarazara<br>  - La Covacha<br>  - Studio<br>  - Bongos<br>  - Mangos<br>  - Tipico Dominicano<br>  <br>  No the beaches aren't crowded Monday thru Thursday and not this time of year because its windy and there's hardly any sun.<br>  <br>  Have fun and enjoy your vacation! :)
d6OD54Puaa	Here you go!!!, Take the Red Line to 72nd St..  When you come up from the subway, look to the right.  Go to Gray's Papayas. It's on the corner of Broadway and 72nd.  I thought the "N" place had the best hot dogs in NY, but they don't hold as much spark as Gray's Papayas.  You can get a "recession special"... 2 dogs for $1.50. They are so juicy.  You can also get a variety of fresh made juices, hence the name Papayas.  It's a take out joint so when you leave exit onto 72nd St.and head right.  At the corner, look to the left.  There's the famous Dakota apartments.  John Lennon was there.  Cross the street and enter Central Park.  You will be entering Strawberry Fields.  There are benches and it's very serene.  Enjoy your dogs there and enjoy the  new spring.   Hopefully it will be nice weather for you and your uncle to take a stroll around Central Park and catch up.  You can't miss with this advise.  Trust me.|`|lqXmvJdRaa	Go to any convenience store and ask for a "fun pass" for the subway. They are the same thing as a metro card but you pay one price and you can use it all day. Staten Island ferry is the best freebie in the city. You can walk over the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, Wall Street, Grand Central Station, all ffree.|`|g8LLIeXKaa	Cheap In the City<br>  <a href="http://www.cheapinthecity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheapinthecity.com/</a>|`|rSq790ksaa	Ferris Wheel in Times Square in Toys R Us.<br>  Go to the top of the Rockefeller Center.<br>  Walk around Central Park.
dKTPewhTaa	It could mean a lot of things.  Depending on your culture is a big factor.  Let me tell you what it means in America.  It means that the woman should consider letting him have more than one woman in a relationship. Not the traditional I am yours and only yours.  <br>  Financially it might mean that he wants a woman who will not be the traditional stay at home mom.  It could mean get out and work and pull your weight with our family.  Good luck with a man who tells you he is looking for a woman with an open mind.|`|0nKRaVsCaa	that could mean a varitey of things depending on the person saying it. my opinion: willing to try new things, not affraid of commitment, not posessive, is ok with it if her partner has other friends (even if they female), goes with the flow, willing to cooperate/negociate in a conflict.|`|ShJhsXouaa	it means that he wants a one that leaves hime to do what he wants to do also he should let her do what she wants to do i think he wants a uropean wife not an egyptian one coz egypt hsnt got open minded women|`|pUU4EOCHaa	A woman open to new things or ideas, somebody almost spontaneous; somebody unprejudiced.|`|dT8tbGrLaa	the man wants to stick it anywhere without any complaints|`|AA10950111	It means he's a smart man. And a strong man.|`|qJDwQFk4aa	why this quis in egypt catagory ?|`|mbgBFjKOaa	He wants a woman who will do three-ways.|`|YcWGDKvkaa	He would wonder if you wouldn't mind a three, four, five...some.|`|d117226cff9e65399c2226c82fd237a5aa	in your culture it would mean that he is looking for a sinfull affair.<br>  BE CAREFULL|`|bf53076282d63a118b6c6376828ec305aa	he's looking for a b**ch|`|yTAqjJ7aaa	Depending on the situation really and also culture, i think it means that he wants a woman who is open to ideas and accepts other peoples views and opinions and can understand this, someone who is not narrow-minded but can look at peoples views in a different perspective <br>  <br>  some of these answers lol if it said "i am looking for a woman with an open mind in bed" - then maybe i would have given you a different answer.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Intelligence....willing to understand others who are different in views, not cookie cutter beliefs. I consider myself open-minded & I am not prejudice, I can put myself in an other person's shoes easily or I am willing to try.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	it means that the woman has to be open for any time of conversations  and some time lifestyles<br>  that he does not have to walk on eggshells to act|`|hhhk499qaa	I think he means that he wants a woman that is smart and know what to do.|`|r6SL1pJaaa	It means he's looking for Trouble !!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	He wants to have sex with you and your sister at the same time|`|AA11152480	it depends on the mind & the culture of the people u r from,<br>  for us :<br>  usually he means a woman that can make concessions , give up somethings , could be a material things or sometimes it's moral or traditions things and even sometimes he asks to give up her self<br>  but i must say not all of the men like this , some of them - rarely - means he wants  a woman that's a thinker, a reliable, a woman that don't stick to some bad traditions & behaviors in their society .<br>  simply a different woman .|`|DSVUvfGuaa	Well it means that he is looking for some one who can have fun in a way like a man and not shy meeting others. Who also can change ideas and join others in open conversations and have the same rights as any other person among her colleges.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	When it comes to relationships, it means a girl who does not care if he/or they both see other people at the same time. It might even mean that she will not care if he see's other guys in a intimate. Maybe he is bi.<br>  Or it could mean he wants a girl who is open to all kinds of sexual experiences. S and M and all of that.|`|qOBinxDsaa	like a women who likes doing stuff that most people dont understand umm being able 2 be abstract ect.. not 2 easy 4 me 2 explain O.O|`|KLv4OZMYaa	I used to have an open mind,<br>  but my brains kept falling out!|`|168Ble6Iaa	it means easy women,,,give her self without thinking|`|dbe2eb2f4bce5ba413cf891959ba7115aa	it means her brains are falling out|`|RyYV3aXlaa	dirty sex.....or some thing like it.....

They may have other requirements that you may not be aware of. Maybe it would be best to go with schools that have the same school year as the US.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	Actually, High School Entrance Examinations in Philippine High Schools can be conducted at any time of the year, depending on circumstances.<br>  <br>  She can try asking DLS-Zobel when she goes here if they still offer entrance exams. If not, other prestigious schools such as Assumption School, Poveda School, British School, and International School Manila are other potential options - and the last two start their school year on September - a major help for your cousin.<br>  <br>  The genuine report cards are not really prerequisites - as long as you have a photocopy of them. If you don't, however, they WON'T admit you.

JQKADWyzaa	I personally think it's horrible. <br>  There is a line that you do not cross when it comes to little girls.<br>  I understand putting them in ballet class, and then wearing makeup for a recital, or playing dress up and wearing entirely too much makeup.<br>  <br>  But as for pageants definitely not!<br>  Kids should be playing outside and playing games.<br>  not going to Tanning beds and getting their eyebrows done.<br>  I wouldn't enter my child in one, esp. not one of the really extreme freaky kinds.<br>  <br>  It's really sad, they need to learn that there are way more important things then beauty|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	That little girl is a paedophile's dream date.<br>  <br>  That's just wrong, it's freakish and disgusing and any parent who gets their children into this should be .... well, convicted of a crime at least.|`|2pjRC0Kkaa	i think its wrong because its pressuring little girls. and it sometimes causes them to grow up faster and act more mature than they're really supposed to be.|`|7oA361fbaa	Personally I don't agree with it. Let kids be kids I say. This is making them grow up far too fast.<br>  <br>  I don't know how things are here, but I watched a documentary about child beauty pageants in the USA and the parents were all consumed by it, most of them spending hours travelling, going to pageant after pageant, and I even saw one of the little girls being shouted at by her mother and grandmother for not getting placed high enough.<br>  <br>  I think in a lot of cases it is the parents living out their dreams through their kids.|`|4VY7u6tNaa	Children, and more so little girls, should be left to be what they are. Little girls, with the clothes and make up etc, it no longer leaves the impression they are children anymore, more like adults. And it just disgusts me to think what some sicko could be thinking looking at those pictures. I personally wouldn't put my daughter through that form of child abuse.|`|373267de54a567ce4fdd303d84705891aa	i think it is so wrong and no i would never enter my kids in them. They look like little women in those pics. Its just teaching them that appearance is the most important thing in life...when they grow up theyll prob have low esteem or be very shallow. Its sad. Kids that age should be out playing and getting dirty, not worrying about their nails and make up.|`|sz5J9V6aaa	Jesus Christ, thats bloody child abuse!<br>  Are you sure the last one is actually a person? Not a barbie doll? Sure looks like one...|`|gJ8F634Haa	This should be considered a form of Abuse.  I live in New York and I have yet to see this here.  It is more in the Southern States.  It's totally ludicrous.  Even my girls think so.  The way these parents teach these girls to focus so much on beauty instead of brains is sinful.  These poor kids.  They look scary. The only group of people I can see watching this are the people that do this themselves, people that are just curious and can't believe their eyes and pedophiles.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	I find it very sad...and repulsive. These parents should have just gotten dolls and left it at that. I am in the US, and I am very sad to hear that this awful trend/business has migrated to Ireland. Why not just let the children be children?<br>  <br>  Just repulsive.|`|QE0U6iPKaa	I don't like these photos at all I find them stomach churning. That seems a bit strong but that's how I feel..It is so wrong to plaster these girls faces with huge amounts of make up ..

These poor kids get dragged across the country like showdolls and it costs the parents big bucks for all the costumes, accommodation and travelling etc. Of course the kids themselves will say they enjoy it, it's all they know and they have an encouraging parent telling them all the time it's what they want. Maybe it's true, maybe it's not. <br>  <br>  On a side note, Little Miss Sunshine is a cracker of a film.|`|tGGVeW3yaa	I hate hate when I see pictures of children like this.

I'm from Canada and there's a tv show series on now called "Toddlers and Tiaras". I watched it a couple times to see what it was all about. In one competition in Texas, mothers can actually compete *against* their daughters! <br>  <br>  As well, the show often makes the kids seem like little divas/brats. Granted some kids do enjoy the 'glamour' but for others its obvious the parents are forcing them. I think the natural, make-up free contests are somewhat tolerable, if the kids choose. But 7 year olds shaving their legs? Two year olds wearing mascara? Fake eyelashes? Horrendous!<br>  <br>  Not to mention, all the horrid toxins/chemicals in make-up/hair products/etc. Its bad enough that we as adults use these products, but to put them on a child, when they're still growing? Exposing them like that...blech!|`|dKTPewhTaa	Well, when the little girls enjoy being dressed up it is great.  Some have that personality.  However, my sister put her little boy in pageants and yes he won, but he hated it and she used to yell and threaten him.  And then try to bribe him into competing.  No he didn't have all the makeup, but the outfits were uncomfortable and unnatural to a toddler.  One day he finally refused to go onstage at all and she realized how unreasonable she was being when he did this in public.  What was she going to do with all the other mothers and people starring at her?  <br>  It is okay if it is something the little girl enjoys, but not if she is pushed into it by her parents.  <br>  Also, if it is all the parents do... pageant after pageant, then that is counterproductive to the child because then they don't have a real childhood.  Once or twice is great if the child enjoys it, but to make a career out of it is not really the child's choice.  That's the parents doing and a seemingly a form of child abuse.
qzZAIijJaa	There is no easy way of obtaining a visa to Canada. <br>  <br>  A Visitor's visa or tourist visa is trickier since your Jenny has to have ties back in the Philippines that will prove that she IS coming back before the visa expires (ie family, work, property that she owns etc..). She has to have a certain amount of money available to last her 6 months in Canada (that's the max a tourist can stay then she needs to go home). Here is the link you can visit (for visiting Canada): <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/index...</a><br>  <br>  As a boyfriend, you can't sponsor her under the Family Class (for spouse, common law partner, conjugal partner). <br>  <br>  For common law partner, you must be together for at least a year--12 consecutive months (no interruptions or breaks in between like you going back to Canada for instance) to qualify.|`|sSTXLQEUaa	The temporary resident visa (or tourist visa) is your best bet. That's what I got and it's not as difficult to get as most people think. Well, maybe not for the average filipino. As mentioned, the most important requirement is proof of funds (bank statements, proof of assets, employment certificates, etc. etc.). It will be easier if Jenny has these. If you'll be the one to sponsor the trip entirely, it might be more difficult to prove ties to her home country.<br>  <br>  Why do you say your letter of invitation looks sketchy? It's just straightforward. Invitation to visit for a holiday/vacation, etc. etc. As simple as that. I don't see why you have to falsify info in the letter. The only need I see for falsifying info is in the proof of assets/funds. This you should never ever do as they have means to double check. <br>  <br>  The entire application process usually takes up to 2-3 weeks
KuWLNfYbaa	There are no swear words in the Welsh language.We are God faring chapel people and if we swore everybody would be talking about us in the corner shop|`|fKpBXXJbaa	LOL at arlanymor's answer :) There are plenty of "geiriau rhegi", although I suspect "ffy*" would be the commonest, though swearing much beyond an astonished "Duw!" wouldn't go down very well among chapel-goers. I'm 50, though, and I would never under any circumstances have sworn in front of my parents and older relatives when they were alive.|`|TPVvddHWaa	I always think that people who swear a lot lack enough vocabulary to express themselves without the need.<br>  <br>  I also think that people who decide that certain words are swearing and unacceptable are short of something to worry about.<br>  <br>  Welsh people swear, not all of them, they are no better or worse than any one else.<br>  <br>  It is simple to use a substitute swear word, like Ronnie Barker did in Porridge. He introduced the word Naffing.  Then there is the act of using an every day word as an insult like Tosser. So whilst there are a list of words called swear words, it is just as easy to make it seem like you are swearing by using a substitute word. Blinking and Blooming were often used in films in the 1950s because in those days films were censored and swearing was not permissible in the cinema.|`|jUjkvis8aa	Depends which part of Wales.

etV271ARaa	Pound will devalue. Thats a definite scenario in about 12 months. As will the USD. Euro is represented by too many diverse and competing economies that its too difficult to call. But the US stock market is showing tremendous value now and funds from all over the world are pouring back into Wall Street. The Chinese, Arabs, Japanese, Koreans, etc are holding a LOT of USDs and US Treasury bills and many are converting those financial instruments into stocks in actual companies. This inflow of funds is creating demand for USDs effectively pushing its value upwards. But once the stimulus packages are fully disbursed and the US economy gets moving the dollar will devalue to a more realistic 2.7 to 3.1 against the ringgit. <br>  <br>  Good to hold physical USD now but its a short term investment. 6 to 8 months.

etV271ARaa	Hi Edward, the Brits and Swiss are the only remaining EU members who havent adopted the Euro. And after the USD, Euro, Yen & Pound, the S/Franc is the most heavily traded currency in the money market. <br>  <br>  One reason its stable is that they accept deposits in the other 4 currencies listed above. So at anytime, they have a lot of these currencies to trade to support their S/F. If the Swiss decided to buy up all the S/F trading all over the world by dumping their foreign reserves, all major currencies will crash. Such is their power!<br>  <br>  And as Bird said, the currency mart is controlled by a few individuals who are hiding funds with the Swiss. So they will use everything in their power to keep the S/F stable.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that over 48 Trillion USD went missing from the world's capital markets over the last 18 months. Where did all those funds go? While the entire world is adjusting their lifestyles to prepare for a long economic downturn, some individuals are definitely hiding funds somewhere while complaining about how much wealth they've lost in the stock market. These guys simply cannot pull their funds out from the Swiss Bankers yet. So this is the New World Order at least for another year.|`|03d0cbfac12fca636244e5710c5b9bceaa	because most of the world's top billionaires keep their money in Swiss bank accounts, so they make sure they don't disturb that country or currency and sorry I'm not Colin..|`|EMeAw7Bcaa	a few months later swiss franc will drop i think, if all the rich guys start to panic and withdraw their money, switzerland will go bankrupt, now they are worrying on that

oUqLwOYFaa	Well the first answer that comes to mind is South Padre Island because this is one of the most common places that people travel to for Spring Break in that area. If you're looking for a traditional Spring Break vacation with the partying scene and the beach then a road trip to this destination is probably your best bet.<br>  <br>  However, there are also so many other great things to see in Texas that you definitely do have other Spring Break options if that's not your scene. San Antonio is a great destination because there are so many different things to see there and most of them are affordable 9the Riverwalk, the Alamo, etc.)<br>  <br>  Another great place to go is Austin. The music scene there is so much fun and there's always something to do there related to that. It's a great place to be out and about with people and yet not be quite in that big party scene on the beach.<br>  <br>  If you're looking more for the experience of the road trip itself then a really great one in Texas is to get yourself to Marble Falls and then make the twenty-five-mile drive to Inks Lake. This gives you a chance to see a number of lakes and really enjoy a scenic trip through the state.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|8799b428e2c797785cb05a055b52d711aa	The River Walk is a great idea. There is plenty to do around San Antonio. You can visit the Alamo and the other missions in the area.

PSiNv7gUaa	Not necessarily.  Children under 2 may fly free IF they are sitting in your lap (airlines do have the right to charge you the taxes for lap children though).  If you are in the U.S., this is only when flying domestically.  You must purchase a seat for children 2 and over.<br>  <br>  The FAA does recommend that ALL infants and children up to 40 pounds be restrained in an approved child restraint device (car seat).  This will require you to purchase a seat, although some airlines do offer discounts for children 2 and under having a seat purchased for them.|`|d57099e9d0551bf1846f1f00f5fd9648aa	3 years olds almost always pay full price. 23 months and younger fly free.

If they are 2 years of age or older, they must have a separate seat, by law.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you hold a child in your lap, and the airplane crashes, your child will be killed, but it's up to you to decide whether his death is compensated for by the savings on the ticket.  The FAA very, very strongly recommends that all children of any age have a seat of their own, with proper restraints if they are too small for the standard lap belts.|`|PA0bGBtCaa	Children under the age of 2 fly for free. If they are 2 and 1 day old, then you will have to purchase a seat for them. When you check in for your flight, the airline staff will usually ask to see the birth certificate for the infant just to make sure that they are 2 and under.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	No.<br>  <br>  Now, if you had asked  "under 2" the answer would be maybe. To give a definite answer we would have to know whether you're flying domestically or internationally, and whether the infant is being held on your lap.|`|AA12092556	depends if they need a seat or not.<br>  <br>  if you can just hold the kid (three is pushing it) then no.
giKCTfnfaa	of the value resorts, i think pop century is the best.  however, it's not "cheap" all the time. there are certain times of the year when you can get a $79 rate (sometimes cheaper if they are really needing business).  i priced a value resort last month for march 20-28.  it was $129 + tax. if you call disney directly, sometimes the rates are cheaper.  they do (or at least did) offer aaa discounts.<br>  <br>  <br>  i did notice you said something about it needing to be close to a park.  the ones closer to the parks are the pricey hotels.  disney does offer bus transportation. it's free and very convenient.  word of warning...pop century is the  value hotel you want to stay at if  you are planning to use their transportation.  the value movies, sports and music share buses and are often very crowded.<br>  <br>  *added*<br>  all the hotels within the disney world complex offer magic hours.  it's not set up for just one particular hotel. it's the whole complex.  certain parks have extended hours on certain days. check the disney world website to find out which parks are offering on what days|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Even mentioning a value/moderate price does not give enough information. You know what you are budgeting for the trip, but there are no really cheap/clean motels or hotels.  If you wish to be close to a theme park,  investigate one ot the Disney World Vacation Packages.  I don't know the exact web address, but you can try to Google it.  Many of the hotels have fees about $150 -$195/person/night.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	Every time I go to Disney World with me and my family, we stay at the Sheraton Safari. It's not a Disney hotel but it's very close to all the parks and it has reasonable prices for one room with two beds. It even has a decent swimming pool with a slide that is shaped just like a snake and on the slide you pop out of the snake's mouth. <br>  <br>  The hotel is themed Africa and safari and they have the most stunning decorations and furniture. Also, a really good thing about this hotel is that it is across the street from a lot of shops and restaurants. Instead of always eating at your hotel or paying for a taxi ride to a restaurant, you have everything walking distance from the hotel. So yes, this hotel is great and absolutely affordable. This isn't a Disney hotel but it is very close to all the parks and free shuttles can always take you there. You should really consider staying at the Sheraton Safari hotel.<br>  <br>  Here's more information on the hotel:<br>  <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/p..." rel="nofollow">http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/p...</a>|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	For value I like any of the All-Star resorts.

Like all the DW resorts, the theming is excellent. The lobby has a little "museum" that walks you through the pop icons from the 50's-90's. As far as being near a park, the WDW transportation system will get you anywhere in about 15-20mins.For more info, please see my blog and follow me on Twitter @ DisneyWorldTips!|`|5MmzJ3wHaa	I have stayed at the moderates and determined that they are not worth the extra price.

It's literally 2 minutes away from Hollywood Studios, 5 minutes from Epcot, 15 minutes from Magic Kingdom and 10 minutes from Animal Kingdom.

7PMpJqiiaa	Definitely a posh mega-resort, you will LOVE it!  They have a network of fresh-water ponds with beautiful Japanese koi, with an amazing restaurant that appears to "float" in the water.<br>  <br>  The Grand Hyatt is on the "dry" side of Kauai (this is a relative term remember), so the sun is normally out and there is less rain, which is why it is here next to Poipu Beach.  Good snorkeling, sand and sun!  The water is blue, but not as clear as some parts of the Caribbean or Tahiti because of the rich, nutrients draining from the volcanic islands, there is more algae in the water.  You may not notice the difference, however.<br>  <br>  Make sure to go to the rainy side of the island, called the Hanalei area, you can take a rubber-raft (zodiac) ride along the Na Pali coast to view sea caves and waterfalls that fall into the ocean!  Just make sure to go on a day where the waves are not too rough...<br>  <br>  You can also cruise down the Wailua River to the Fern Grotto.  This is admittedly touristy, but if this is your first time here, definitely worth seeing a navigable river on such a little island!<br>  <br>  Drive up to Waimea Canyon to see an amazing canyon which looks like the Grand Canyon...again amazing to have a canyon like this on such a little island, but of course as the rainiest spot on earth, a lot of water to carve the side of the volcano!<br>  <br>  There is a restaurant which will be fun for you and the family, touristy and campy, but you will really enjoy it!:<br>  <a href="http://www.keokisparadise.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.keokisparadise.com/</a>|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Poipu Beach is a good snorkeling spot on the south side of the island, though not as good as Ke'e Beach up past Princeville on the north. Although, the large north swells can cause a lot of turbulence up there, resulting in cloudy water (there is a high surf advisory with waves to 16 feet right now). You can lay out on the sand at Poipu. But, it's kind of a small strip, not a big expansive sandy beach. The best place to lay out is on the grassy park on the south end of the beach. Or, do so at your resort. And yes, the water is blue and the sand is pretty soft - almost too soft - and it's at kind of a steep angle. That's another reason I recommend the grass.<br>  <br>  About 3 miles to the south is a big, expansive sandy beach called Brennecke Beach. If that's the kind of beach you're looking for, that's the place to go.<br>  <br>  With the exception of snorkeling or hiking around Waimea Canyon, there isn't a whole lot to do on Kauai. It rains a lot (a spot on top of Waimea Canyon is the rainiest spot on earth with nearly 500 inches a year). Day cruises or sunset cruises can be fun, especially this time of year with the whale season. And, a sunset cruise to the Na Pali coast is spectacular (be on the lookout for dolphins playing with the boat). Just be wary of going out on a boat if you get seasick. The high winds and swells this time of year can make the boat rock pretty good. And, once you're out there, you aren't coming back for a few hours.<br>  <br>  But, Kauai is mostly for couples who want a laid back Hawaiian vacation. There's a lot more to do and fun places to go on Maui, which is and has always been my favorite Hawaiian island.|`|PXBm6jovaa	i stayed next door to that hotel, at the outrigger, and the hyatt was NICEEE! i snuck in to the jacuzzi and everything there  on the grounds were perfect. poipu beach is really nice, the sunny side of the island and the water/weather is always ALWAYS warm, even at night the water is like a bathtub. the north side has the best snorkeling, although it can be dangerous at this time of year cause theres huge waves.|`|2Ety14sLaa	It is very posh. I have stayed there several times and this is one of the most luxuriant hotels on Kauai. The beach is right at the hotel and is nice, Monk seals often will come up onto that beach. They are very protected but you will get to see them. There is not anything bad about this place except that it is a bit of a drive to get into town.|`|8VEEihaqaa	The Grand Hyatt is the resort of resorts here on the island.  You'll get exactly what you pay for at this hotel, from menus catered to specific dietary needs, to the most awesome on site amenities at almost any hotel in the state.  This hotel made the Travel Channel's top 10 Hotels in Hawaii (or something like that).<br>  <br>  Poipu beach, while gorgeous, is often over run with tourists, and unfortunately the weather right now is pretty rainy.  My boyfriend and I were in Poipu yesterday and while it wasn't rainy, it was pretty overcast and windy.  The water was still clear though, and the sand at Poipu beach (which is actually down to road by the Sheraton) is soft, I guess...  I can't think of any beaches on Kauai where the sand is hard.  For the most part, any beach you go to on Kauai will have soft sand and crystal clear water, provided of course the weather is nice.  It's when there's a storm (either hitting the island, or offshore) that makes the water dirty.<br>  <br>  The beaches on the North Shore are way nicer than the ones on south side (in my opinion).  Lumahai is my absolute favorite, the most photographed beach in Hawaii, and Ke'e is a famous snorkeling spot, as is Tunnels.<br>  <br>  If you start at Ke'e on the north shore, and drive all the way around the island to Koke'e (which only takes 2-3 hours depending on traffic, seriously), you'll see a complete change through about 4 different climate types, from a rain forest, to the humid sea level coastline, to something I can only describe as rustic suburbs where the plants are between that gorgeous green and yellow, and the color range is much larger, to flat out desert.<br>  <br>  Kauai is also a nature lover's paradise, nicknamed the Garden Island for it's lush tropical greenery.  Don't expect malls, or even large chains like Target, we just got our Costco a couple years ago, just after the Home Depot and Walmart.  Kauai is very laid back, and while we do things on our own time, we do still have lives and places to go.  And lastly, Hawaii, and Hawaiian locals, are all about respect.  Remember, this is our home, we're not all on vacation, and we have a very deep and rich culture.  So long as you remember to respect that people live here and are different from you, you'll be fine.  You wouldn't be too happy with discourteous house guests that left their trash all over the place and made fun of the way you live your lives, now would you?<br>  <br>  That's all I can tell you.  If you have any other specific questions, feel free to email me.

5ZtSR0IQaa	It would be good if you have a map in English to cross reference this. Actually, Google Maps does give place names in English, if you use maps.google.com and not maps.google.co.jp, so that might be good enough.<br>  <br>  There are many good coastal cities in Kanagawa. One that comes to mind aside from Yokohama is Odawara. It's about 20 minutes from Yokohama by bullet train or a hour on a regular train. The average quality of life is probably better than Yokohama or Tokyo there. It just isn't close enough to Tokyo to have a job market to sustain a larger population. Which is probably why life there is decent to begin with. Odawara has a decent beach, known for its kamaboko made from real shark meat, and has Odawara castle as a tourist trap. More likely, a lot of tourists go through Odawara as the gateway to the resort area of Hakone.<br>  <br>  There's really one choice for a big entertainment city in Kanagawa, and that is Yokohama.<br>  <br>  Yokohama and Odawara are directly connected by bullet train, so there's no place to get off by that route. But the bullet train is three times as expensive as the regular train. The city of Fujisawa is almost midpoint between Yokohama and Odawara. It's about 30 minutes by regular train to both Yokohama and Odawara. Train fare to either is around 500 yen each. The top vegetarian restaurants in Japan tend to be Buddhist (shojin). Many of them are in Kyoto or Tokyo. The other choice might be Indian restaurants. Or you can just order fries at McDonalds. But it would be much more amusing if a broke tourist stumbled into a Buddhism temple for shelter, and they just happened to be top notch at shojin cuisine.<br>  <br>  A foot route from Fujisawa to Odawara might be 40km. If you walk briskly at 5km/hr (3 1/8 mph), that's still 8 hours with no breaks. It's about 25km between Fujisawa and Yokohama, so this is more doable in a day's walk. If you wonder why the distance and train times aren't proportional, that's because the train goes faster in the middle of nowhere between Fujisawa and Odawara. Southwestern Yokokohaman and northeastern Fujisawa share borders, so these cities are actually right next to each other.|`|eAMbWkahaa	Kanagawa is a big place, and many just consider parts of it to be a huge suburb of Tokyo.<br>  <br>  Yokohama is the Capital of Kanagawa, and Yokohama is technically Japan's largest city by population with over three million people.<br>  (Tokyo is NOT a city technically speaking).  <br>  <br>  Yokohama is a big city with large entertainment areas, businesses etc, again its a large city with large population.<br>  <br>  There are many places that can fit the description you described, I suggest you do some additional research on wikipedia:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanagawa" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanagawa</a>

It is located between Latitude 30O 22 40 N to 33O 12 20 N and Longitude 75O 45 55 E to 79O 04 20 E. It has a deeply dissected topography, complex geological structure and a rich temperate flora in the sub-tropical latitudes. Physiographic ally, the State can be divided into five zones viz. (i) Wet Sub-temperate zone, (ii)  Humid Sub-temperate zone, (iii) Dry temperate-alpine High lands, (iv) Humid Sb-tropical zone, and (v) Sub-Humid Sub-tropical zone. Wet Sub-temperate sone comprises Palampur and Dharamsala of Kangra District, Jogindernagar area of Mandi district and Dalhousie area of Chamba district, Humid Sub-temperate zone comprises the districts of Kullu, Shimla, parts of Mandi, Solan, chamba, Kangra and Sirmour, Dry temperate-Alpine High lands include major parts of Lahaul-Spiti, Pangi and Minnaur, Humid Sub-tropical zone consists district Sirmaur, Bhattiyat valley of district chamba, Nalagarh area of district Solan, Dehragopipur and Nurpur areas of district Kangra and; Sub-humid tropical zone sirmaur and Indora area of district Kangra.<br>  <br>      Climatically Himachal Pradesh can be divided into three zones (I) The outer Himalayas, (ii) The Inner Himalayas and (iii) Alpine zone. The first zone gets annual rainfall between 150 cms and 175 cms. In second it varies between 75 cms to 100 cms and the Alpine zone remains under snow for about five to six months. The average annual rainfall in the State is about 160 cms. The climate varies between hot and a humid in the valley areas to freezing cold in the home of perpetual snow.<br>  <br>      The soils of Himachal Pradesh can be divided into nine groups on the basis of their development and physio-chemical properties. These groups are alluvial soils, Brown hill soils, Brown earths, Brown porests soils, Grey wooded or Podozolic soils, Grey brown podzolic soils, Plansolic soils, Humus and iron Podzols and Alpine hunus mountain skeletal soils.<br>  <br>      Five perennial rivers Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab and Yamuna flow through its territory. The utility of these rivers though restricted considerably by the rugged and undulating terrain of the State, nevertheless, these rivers posses immense potential for the generation of hydro-electricity.

h0jCqEfeaa	Venice experiences very high humidity, with hot weather in July and August, the height of summer. Temperatures in summer usually range between 86°F to 91°F (30°C - 33°C), dropping in winter to between 32°F and 37°F (0°C - 3°C). Due to its location on the Adriatic coast, Venice often experiences thunderstorms and rain showers which, particularly in spring and autumn, tend to cause flooding. Known as the 'acqua alta,' it is best to pack waterproof shoes or boots, to avoid a soaking. April to October is usually the busiest time in Venice, though it is a popular destination year round. Christmas, Easter, Carnival (in February) and the Venice International Film Festival (in August) are also busy periods and winter is perhaps the best time to travel to Venice to avoid crowds and find better rates on accommodation. I would say the best time to visit is April, May or September. The key is avoiding the floods and the crowds.<br>  <br>  There are lagoon tours.<br>  <br>  Cool tourist attractions: San Marco Piazza (climb the Campanile for the views), Rialto bridge, Gondolas (too expensive), etc. The best thing is just to wonder endlessly through all the streets without looking at the map.<br>  <br>  Hotel: Alloggi Agli Artisti (right beside the train station, Venice is the last place you want to be lugging bags around)<br>  <br>  4-5 days seems just perfect.
