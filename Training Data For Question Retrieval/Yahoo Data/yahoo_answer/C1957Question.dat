Has anyone had, or heard of, strong magnetic anomaly's (iron deposits in the ground) affecting digital images made with Fujifilm SX900?   If so, can a Faraday cage surmount the issue?   I did series of shots @ a golf course & the shots were unusable, so I deleted them; then re-shot the series & they to were unusable.

20090220075156AAQGEf6	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Best Buy TV Replacement Plan?	I bought a samsung 42'' 720p 2 years ago (almost exactly) with a 4 year warranty. It has been in the shop for 2 week so far, but it needs a new power supply and a board, so it is looking like Best Buy will not cover the repairs. The TV originally cost $1400 (actually $1600 but we got a discount at the register because we bought the service plan and an entertainment stand). How much money will we get toward a new TV - I don't want an inferior brand, I purchased Samsung for a reason. However, I would be willing to go with another brand IF they upgraded us to 1080p at the same size (however, it seems the only options now are 40'' and 46'', no longer 42'' at least online). I am NOT willing to drop in size. Any opinions on what will happen?

My purpose is twofold; I have a ton of home videos that are aging and taking up space; I'd like to do a straight conversion to DVD on them without involving my PC in the process (VHS->DVD), but I also have some videos on my computer that are too large for my CD writer to put on CD and I do not have a DVD recorder. Anyone know of a commercial unit that will fulfill both of these functions? I understand I would need to run a cable of some sort from the PC to the unit to get the files off the PC but this is something I am considering, rather than buying a DVD writer and installing it.

I'm on my third one now and its starting to mess up again.  The first two I got were some generic brand that cost like $5 a piece and each one lasted about 6 months i believe.  The third one i got was a Dynex and a little more expensive so i thought it would last forever. But its been around 6 months too and its starting to go bad.  You see it starts to go bad when the right audio starts to not work.  And i'm sure it's the cable and not the ipod or radio cuz when i use a brand new one it works perfectly fine.  Is there a way to correct this? Is there a better brand out there or will they all end up having the same fate?

I called Sprint and they apologised and said I wasn't signed up for any reoccurring payments and they said it would not happen again however, they did not refund my money.  This month, the same thing happened.  They took out $145 from my account without permission again.  Once again, they aplogised but said I would have to call my bank and my bank would have to stop the transaction.  My bank said that they have to wait for 5 days and then I can dispute it.  I'm tired of disputing this every month.  Isn't this like stealing when they do not have permission?  I've had 2 people from Sprint tell me I do not have reoccurring payment set up.

I'm looking for a camera either already on the market or planned for release in the next few months that features "capture and process" GPS technology. Note that this is NOT the same as a camera with a built-in GPS unit. The "capture and process" method only requires a tiny GPS chip that records a 200ms burst of raw GPS signal data when a picture is taken, which is then processed by the computer to determine the location.

Hi People      I've never played on a Wii before, but I'm interested in getting one simply for the fun & novelty of it.      I'd like to know if it's worth doing so, given that:      - I don't plan on using the console in a social context at all. I play purely alone.   - I'm grown up and I'm not a "casual" gamer ... but I feel I may appreciate the unique concept & approach of the Wii console, provided it is executed well.   - right now the only games Wii games I'm keen on buying are Wii Sports, Wii Fit & Big Brain Academy. I'm not aware of any other current (or future) games that would appeal to me.      Any input & opinions would be much appreciated.

20090220095258AAxuiA7	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Questions about the Iphone 3G?	Okay, I am getting a new phone this month or early next month, and I ALWAYS wanted an Iphone because I do go on the internet a lot and I do email a lot. So I thought the Iphone would be a good phone for me. But after reading the reviews, I heard that the phone really sucks and that made me upset because I thought it was a good phone.    And so I was wondering if the Iphone is a good phone or not? I'm looking for a phone with a good web browsing, email, and a good connectivity when I talk.  Is there a phone that is much better or similar to the Iphone? Or is the Iphone a good phone overall?      Please answer only if you had or have an Iphone. :)

20090220101754AArK0P5	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox 360 RRoD for 2 on the left?	First off I don't want any answers saying to send it to microsoft, cuz my warranty expired last month and the RRoD warranty doesn't cover for my original problem, the 1 RRoD on the bottom right. Now to my problem, I stripped my xbox all the way to the motherboard, and applied the heat sink compound to my CPU/GPU chips. I then tried to get the thing to overheat, but the 2 left RRoD pop up before the system even heats up at all! The heat sinks are supposed to be very hot, but mine are not. I don't know if I used the wrong compound, or if I didn't clean the CPU/GPU enough. I used some heat sink compound from Radio Shack and there was a little bit of old compound still on the CPU/GPU that I couldn't get off after awhile. The only other thing I can think of trying is to find some Arctic Silver, but I don't know if that would work either. Any insight would be great!

I have a nice Samsung 52 inch HDTV but all I have is basic cable without a cable box. (yes im cheap but i dont need a box for the channels i watch nor do i wish for HD channels)      My problem is that the 480i picture comes out in 1080p format and is extremely fuzzy.  Unfortunately i can not scale down the display for the HDTV and need to find either a DVD player or Blu-ray player that can convert "regular Analog SD" cable tv to 1080p format.      I have seen numerous players that will take the dvd's format from 480i or 720p to 1080p but nothing that would take the tv signal from 480i to 1080p.      Any suggestions?

20061211092521AABANsb	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear	My PS2 controllers are cursed!?	I have gone through at least 6 controllers, since I got my Playstation 2.  I lose about 1 controller a year.  My first two could have been because I abused them whenever I got pissed to that point, but eversince then I have been pretty careful.      And whenever one malfunctioned, it was the same symptom every time.  It would always want to move the character  to the left very slowly; and/or cursor would cycle through all the option faster than I could ever do myself.  I think maybe one of them might have had a turbo button, but only one of them if any, so that can't be the problem.  The worst thing is that it isn't consistant: sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.  Just to be a bigger pain in my ***!      My cousin got his Playstation 2 about a month before I got mine and he's had the same controller eversince!  Dust collects easily in my house so maybe that's it.  And now my new infrared controllers are starting to screw with me.  What's wrong with them?  Did I anger the PS2 gods?

20070104120453AAzJrpn	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Why won't my iPod won't connect to my home desktop computer?	So, I finally got an iPod.  I was out of town for Christmas and used the computer at the house I was at.  I download iTunes fine, and the iPod connected fine with the computer and I was able to download music and charge it.  Now that I'm home, I tried using my own computer since that's the computer I'll be using and iTunes downloaded fine, but the iPod won't connect.      I've tried all the USB ports on the computer (3 total).  The first time, a notice came up saying the computer couldn't recognize the external hardrive, and if I wished to continue that it might affect the use of the iPod.  Naturally I said no, because I didn't understand.  But now the computer won't even recognize that I have a USB cord plugged into it.  I have a Gateway desktop purchased 4 1/2 years ago.  It charges the iPod, but it won't sync up so I can download playlists and more music, photos, etc.      I've also powered down the computer several times and the iPod as well.      Can you help?

I walked off and let her do it and I came back to find she'd finished it, but in the proccess all the glue had run and glued the clickwheel down.      Is there any way of dissolving the glue off without running it under water? I kinda want to be able to use my iPod again!
