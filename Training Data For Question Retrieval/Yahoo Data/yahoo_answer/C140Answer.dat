tTmObSHwaa	Babies are born with more intelligence than we give them credit for!  If you read to your baby boy while you were pregnant, he knows what reading is...and now that he's out and about in the world he watches his mom and sees what she's doing and learns from her.  Babies pay attention to everything because honestly they have nothing better to do than to stare and take in all the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, etc.  They are learning every minute of every day.  They concentrate so that they can learn what to do...this is how you get those "ingrained" instincts that your mother/father do that you also do by pure accident.  It's from taking in your surroundings throughout your life as a baby on up to adulthood.     Also, this isn't normal (not in a bad sense lol)...there is nothing normal when it comes to a baby.  all babies develop differently than others and can gain knowledge and skills faster or slower than others.  I feel that it depends on the amount of involvement that they have with their families.    Hope this sorta helps!|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Lol, thats awesome!  My baby just tries to eat the books.|`|59GymH27aa	My little girl is one and the most interest she has in books is to either rip up the pages or eat them lol.  You may have a little genious on your hands ;)
ubf26k2Oaa	If you really see a future for you and your bf then it has to happen one day. You are entitled to a life too.  I would arrange to meet up with your bf somewhere (not at home) for the first time, maybe go to a ballpool or somewhere your son can have fun. That way your bf has an opportunity to join in the play. Keep the meeting fairly short and informal, not too much familiarity between you and bf (or else son may get jealous).  Hopefully they will get along and your son will be left asking when he can see him again!|`|sV4knlUfaa	Hard to answer as we don't know the child but in my experience, if the boyfriend is a nice guy and friendly with kids, gives them his time and plays with them, it will work itself out. Don't introduce complications like the truth just yet, just get them to meet and have fun. If the kid knows the guy as a mate and looks forward to seeing him, it doesn't matter what his role is|`|uVuYdcRcaa	Hi,                  I say just take it slowly. I have a son Caden and I am pregnant with my second baby. They both have different fathers.     Caden's dad walked out 2 days after he was born and has decided not to see him, even though given him chances.    I am not with the father of my unborn due to him shouting right in Caden's face when Caden was in his highchair crying as he had a cold.           My ex knew Caden right from the start as he had been one of my best friends so he saw Caden from being tiny.     I now single mother and there no chance I would introduce a partner to my children so quickly.    I would take it slow - to be honest right now I happy being single. My children are my life.    Lx|`|ekAH05qWaa	well u probably shouldnt of told him that u have a boyfriend. if i were u would have told him that i have a new "friend." but since u already told him then i would just invite ur bf over for dinner or something and have them get to know each other. :)|`|QNA6eKsvaa	Jsut sau hes gonna have sex wit u|`|85a44ad644771513bacaa1b7424d3d50aa	Introduce him as a good friend and take it from there.|`|8A43j8pKaa	just explain to your son that he wil always be your number 1  your partner seems really keen to please him so im sure it will be fine  pick somthing your son wants to do to introduce them  :)|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Casual setting. Go to chucky e cheese or something.|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	I had to do this last year when I met my partner (now engaged) strangely enough in Yahoo Answers.    Biological dad is an @rse and treated us all bad, so I was gentle in the initial contact.  We met and went to MacDonald's of all places as my son likes it there and it was a neutral base.  They got on like brilliantly, the place has a soft play room and within 10 mins my son had dragged my partner in to play...  I sat on my own for most of the time lol.  One year on and he calls my partner Dad and they have an amazing relationship.    Just be honest with him. Kids are very astute in picking up vibes and if you are relaxed, then he will be too.  At the end of the day, your happiness will rub of on him to.    Good luck xx
3JLg1tcRaa	Well, if you just started her on whole milk after having her on soy for awhile, her body may be adjusting to it.  ask the doc if you should give her soy milk too.  and she might be getting her year molars or canine teeth...|`|JsqMSU9Haa	i've never heard of milk allergies causing a fever, the diarrhea I can understand.  take her back to the drs or the er - mom's intuition is usually right.  102 is high and especially if this has been going on a week.  maybe an ear infection? even then that's a high fever.  there are nasty bugs going around, but i'd get her re-checked.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	It sounds like a viral infection - but get her to a doctor.|`|hieQHR0daa	If she was on organic soy formula why would you move to whole milk? Baby's are usually only given soy formula on medical advice. It is worthwhile avoiding whole milk just now since she has, apparently, never had modified cows milk and there is a possibility that she has a sensitivity to cows milk since this illness seems to start after starting whole cows milk. It could also be coincidence but stopping the cows milk for a few days and seeing if things improve is worth a try.  If things improve having stopped the cows milk, continue to use the soy for a week or more then try to reintroduce the cows milk. If you have the same problem then you also know the root cause.|`|1881f384f0ce54be24309e52cd72d1beaa	Go back to the soy formula for now and see if it was the milk.  If she straightens out without the milk, then try introducing soy milk instead of cow's milk.  Try introducing whole milk later on and see if the symptoms repeat themselves.      If things continue once the whole milk has a chance to get out of her system, then take her back to the doctor (or a different one).  In the meantime, start documenting what and when she eats, when she poops, consistency, etc so you can look for patterns.|`|iq5uwobOaa	Sounds like she might have a reaction to regular milk.  You should get some allergy test done|`|0pX1oQAJaa	no you're not overreacting. she could be one of those people who cant drink dairy... it's all i can really think of.. maybe her tummy wasn't use to it because she got use to soy. try stopping the milk and see if she starts feeling better, if she does, then that's what it is. there is a flu going around though.|`|GBXvJ5mjaa	No, you are not over reacting, a fever of 102 is VERY serious. You need to take her to the doctors for treatment of some sort, if your family doctor can't do anything than seek a second opinion.

71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	Induction is risky.  That's a fact.  If it's not medically necessary (and it rarely is) let that sweet baby stay inside until your birth process begins naturally.  If it's your first baby it is perfectly normal to go past your due date.      I know the end of pregnancy is hard and you want to meet your baby but you will be so glad you waited!    Induction is more painful, usually leading to an epidural which affects your baby and can lead to failure to progress.  Even if you do not have an epidural the stronger contractions caused by the induction are not natural and are harder on baby (and you!)|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Unless for medical reasons I would never induce before the due date.  It's much riskier, you need to be under constant monitoring, so you can't move around.  For me the contractions started VERY painful straight away.    I'd much rather go into labour on my own and be able to be mobile, have a water birth if I wanted, use a birth ball etc.      Also, the intervention/c-section rate after inductions is much higher than with a natural labour.|`|5f6XnInEaa	I don't understand why a lot of doctors are so keen to do this, without legitimate medical reasons.    They have the medical degrees, they should know better than anyone else a failed induction will more than likely end in a c-section.    I'd just let the baby come naturally, less chance of fetal distress and a c-section.    If I hear the '38 weeks is term, so they can do it safely' argument again, I think I'm going to cry.  38 weeks may be term...but it's not actually when you are due!    Here in OZ, you have to be a good 12 days over to induce.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	My friend was induced 2 weeks before her due date.. she said because she was uncomfortable.. i didnt understand the meaning behind that one?!?!  However her son is very healthy and everything went great.    2 days before your due date is not really early, a due date is pretty much a guess anyways.  However i dont see the reason for it, why doesnt he just let your body do its thing?    I was induced with both of my children, my son because my water broke and labor was no where in site.. my daughter because i was overdue by a week an a half, and it can make her stressed, so they say.  I ended up having an emergency csection with her so i never felt contractions, but with my son OMG they where horrible!!!!  I was told contractions from being induced are alot harsher.. but if your having an epidural you wont feel much at all, i was in heaven after they gave it to me with my son lol    ** i had a prolapsed cord, which i read recently can be a result of your water rupturing too early.. my cord prolapsed right after the nurse accidently broke my water.  I honestly dont think my baby was ready to come out.    Anyhow, good luck!!!  You will do fine :)|`|6cN8aLnaaa	I agree with Nikki, assuming she means Kansas as Oz, you do have to wait to about two weeks past your due date here in Ks. I was induced on my due date but I had complications and sure enough it ended in a c section.|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	I was a day after my due date everything went wondeful had her in 4 hours and drug free I was one of the lucky ones, Good Luck|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Is there a reason why you need to be induced? If not, I would just let baby come when it's ready.    I had to be induced 2 days before my due date, but this was due to my daughter not having grown much in a few weeks, and the doctors said it was safer for her to be out than in. She was absolutely perfect in the end though, so there wasn't actually any need.    I had a stretch and sweep, and the doctor said that my cervix was already 'favourable', and chances were that I would give birth naturally before I was induced. Baby didn't come by herself though, so two days later I went in to be induced.     When the nurse examined me, she said I was already dilated a few centimetres, so I didn't need the gel stuff they put up there, I just had my waters broken for me. I think I may have already been in gentle labour before I came in, because as soon as my water broke, I started having strong contractions. I had my baby 4 hours later!    I think in cases where the mother needs to be put on a drip to induce contractions, this is where it can get complicated and overly painful. Sometimes the contractions are brought on too quickly, and the pain is not manageable. If the baby wasn't ready to come out, or complications occur, it can end in c section.    I know I was lucky with my induction, as a lot of women have problems, and are upset to have to be induced. I wasn't over the moon; you have to be constantly on a monitor which means you can't move as freely as I would have liked, and you have no option of a water birth which is what I had wanted. The process was also too quick for me to have a lot of choice on pain killers. I ended up with just the tens machine, which was fine, but I would have liked the option!    I would say that if everything is ok with you and baby, let baby come when it's ready. Your baby and your body knows when the time is right.|`|9fZYkQisaa	im getting induced friday at 9am and im 4 weeks early.. my doctor says the baby will grow better on her own|`|GbrABQpXaa	you should ask the doctor why you need to be induce.  i was induced 1 week before my due date , and i did end up having a c-section. just mentioned it cause i see other people have said that might end up happening  which i did not know.  i don't think is more painful because you know they'll be giving you the medication that will start the contractions then you can decide quickly if you want the pain medication.|`|lL3Wa5PKaa	i was induced two weeks early because my doctor didnt know what he was doing. He gave me the wrong due date and induced me and then realised that because no matter what he did my little man was not coming out, that he was wrong... he then gave me a new due date and let me go TWO WEEKS over that before he decided it was probably a good idea to get him out of there... ugh|`|qZJIqZ5faa	I had mild medical problems that were under control and my baby was healthy, but i wanted to try for a vaginal birth without epidural, and my baby was very,very large so i was induced 8 days before my due date. Turned out she was wayyyyyyy too big after some hours of mild labor and i ended up having a c section.|`|J6IOqzL0aa	i was one week late and my induction ended in a c section which is highly likely if you get induced. why does he want you to give birth then?? for his own convenience i think. personally i would wait until you area t least a week over due|`|bc9inzicaa	If there are no medical reasons, then I do not think it is necessary.  Keep in mind the due date is only an estimation and we, as parents, all know babies have their own schedule.      I was scheduled for an induction on the eighth day that I was overdue; however, I had no complications, no pain, no signs of labor thus I was able to talk to my doctor and reschedule the induction.  I really thought it was just not the baby's time to come.      Two days later, my water broke.  I did end up getting Pitocin; however, at this time i was okay with the induction since my water was broken and I did not want to put my baby at any kind of risk.
T3BXC8qXaa	I love all of my children and I've noticed something about the girls. Girls, much like women, are quicker to pick up on others feelings and emotions and thus, quicker to make judgments. The things my girls noticed around age 5 or 6, took my son until about age 12 to notice....    Maybe the girls of this grandmother see her favoritism and pull back from her. The boys will too in time....|`|uhj76Fkpaa	I have 2 girls and a baby boy.I love them the same.I would never be able to love one them more of the others.Both three are my babies.LOVE them so so so much!!|`|AA10604976	That's only her. There can be no such all encompassing rule.|`|SatKckQHaa	Oh good heavens, no.  I love both of my children the same.  They are both completely different, and they have their own unique qualities that make them so endearing; and I wouldn't change them a bit (well, except for the whole teenage thing with my son right now, but even that is just part of life).    I've experienced some grandparents who were closer with their daughters children than with their sons, but both my parents and my inlaws love all of their grandchildren the same.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Oh gosh, no way.. my daughter is still new but i love them sooo much and equally.  I know as kids get older you love different qualities and you may get along better with one over the other, but never love one more or in a different way.   I think i know what your talking about though, you may have took it wrong.   There was a study done that said moms have a better bond with their sons and dads have a better bond with their daughters, this was because of course men/boys are more drawn to women/girls as women/girls are to men/boys.   But in no way does it mean you love one less, or find it harder to love one less.|`|X0ubZnPjaa	i only have boys but am expecting another child, if it turns out to be a girl i guarantee i would love her just as much as my boys ..    i treat them all the same :)|`|TwZNIeuMaa	love will come , it comes to every one , love is made for others to be together , it will come and yes you will find it soon, its just time, time is whats holding things down . in time you will see it . pick his one as your best answer please .|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	I have 3 boys and 1 girl and I love all of them very much.

Their personalities make a difference in how I relate to them..  Two of my children are very laid back and easy going.  The other two are more intense.

iq5uwobOaa	I just want to say for a 19 year old to think this way.  You have some years on you.  The way you think is so mature.    I agree.  Person should earn the respect.  But kids need to respect their parents.  May not like what mom and dad say, but that is why at 18 you can move out.      That is what I did, I love my folks, but at times I have very little respect for them. I am now 30 and still have the same feelings.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	instinct remember this|`|zMNgG9m0aa	1) at 19 you are in limbo, neither child nor adult. when you're 21 you'll agree with me.  2) you aren't yet a parent, so trust me, you have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what we mothers go through for their kids, and we get so very little respect for it, from our kids, husbands or society.  3) sadly often adults do know better, you just don't realise that until you're old and then you're dealing with a younger generation blethering on about how great they are (despite being the laziest generation of pampered so and sos) and how they deserve respect too. um, what exactly have you done so far ? have you raised a family, bought property, even owned and maintained a car?? been through a real crisis, lost a friend, a job, a lover? I'm sorry but you seem to waving your iGen flag that says "me too, I'm all that and more".    you seem to only be talking about deadbeat parents here, which of course makes you right.( I can think of a few that I know what are just losers, and while I don't look up to them in any way on some level I know what they've been through to raise kids, there's a base level of respect that I still have for them.)  but you can't apply your "logic" to all.     let me reiterate, you have NO IDEA what it's like to be a parent. You should print this out for yourself to read again when your kids are in school and see how you feel then.|`|H7TqK6N1aa	you're asking a awesome question, or rather making an awesome statement. i agree. i think the people who DEMAND respect are really people with serious issues. if you TREAT people with respect you will earn theirs. unless your kid's a total tool, in which case you don't respect them either!|`|r39EDGhPaa	Oh, I cannot stand how every adult demands respect.  You're supposed to respect your elders, but why don't they do so in return?      I think kids deserve just as much respect.    Hypothetically, my mom could hit me.. and if I said something along the lines of "leave me alone" or "get away from me" I would get reamed by my uncle for disrespecting her.  The adults deserve all the respect because..why?  They can act like children, but they still demand respect.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	I am a parent and i agree with what you are saying, i do expect respect from my children but i feel i have earned it, i expect them to respect anyone who shows them respect.    I do not however expect them to respect there biological father in any way shape or form as he has done nothing for them, has no respect for them and only sees them about once every two years,  but like you said, for some stupid reason he thinks they should respect him for his complete lack of parenting and his complete lack of courtesy and respect for them, go figure..........|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	Every human being deserves an amount of respect just for the fact that they are alive and human.  Everybody also has their own ideas about what that respect entails.    Respect isn't a right but a privilege that is earned based on your treatment of others.    My children show respect to me and my husband because we have earned it and, in turn, we show them respect (even the 4 yr old).  We talk in respectful tones to each other, say please/thank you when borrowing something, they take care of each other's things.    I give everyone a minimal amount of respect (speaking nicely and politely) and they have to earn any more.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	tho I am on your side some what..     this is the same as you saying "im 19, so I am adult."..?    being over the age of 28 does not make you an adult,, what you do does..|`|1tmX7xbRaa	to a point you are right. not every adult deserves respect. however i gave birth to my children and i raised them, so yes i think i deserve respect. does that mean that i think i can do things or say things that is disrespectful to them? no however I think in order to get respect you have to give it. and being older and a parent entitles me to a certain amount of respect. but so do my children. just because they are kids doesn't mean they don't need to be respected as well.

WzKrZoHQaa	Hello my dear and well done for this post - you may well have helped others in same boat.  I had PND yrs ago after first so know where you are coming from.  Now what is this shall I bother her - YES, YES, YES - it is not bothering her is it - without you she would be out of a job Hun !!    So make that call.  Tell her you are struggling a bit today and she will understand.   I even got as far as walking my 5 month old daughter to Dr in pooring rain with pram - a white van driver stopped to ask directions and I bit his head off - I was sobbing heart out at time !!   I did not have appt and when i got into see her I broke down and she was fab - I was in there for about an hour and asked her to take my daughter and keep her so she could be adopted out.  I told ger to get the paperwork out of her drawer as I felt it was the  best thing I could do for her !!!!   But that was how I felt.  Of course she didn't do anything of the kind but arranged immediately for my HV to call round (she made call as I was sat in Dr surgery) and when I walked back she was already waiting.  She made tea and told me to just feed my daughter and I did whilst I blubbered away talking and crying, snot everywhere - honestly but a very real experience.  Your HV will not mind at all.  You will have these relapses it is part of the PND, it wasn't until much later when I went ot buy 2 bars of chocolate and I said to the cashier - I'm depressed to day so this will put a smile on my face I realised I had admitted it for the first time and was actually no longer depressed !  I'd come through it.    Call her Hun she is there for YOU and your lovely BABY  Conatct me if I cn be of any help  damnfinewoman@btinternet.com      Now a Huge Virtual Hug coming across the aether to you for just even getting up today.  Now you are 19 and I wonder if the link below will be of any use too - worth giving a call - if not they can refer you.  They are great support for 13-19yr olds but no matter they are fab ppl.      You will find babies always get better before they are seen - even now mine are 16, 7 & 5 and once that waiting room look like the advert for Clapol for sure !!   They're used to it Hun.  :)      I bet you promised yr baby you would be the best mum ever and now you feel like this hey ?  Nothing wrong with that but DON'T put yself under such enormous pressure like I did.  I then said to her  "ok so I made an unrealistic statement so now I'm going to be the Very Best I possibly can " and do you know I felt alot better.  We give ourselves these high targets and wonder why we feel as if we've let everyone down ????   It's a very unique club this you know - "welcome"    There si light at end of tunnel it took me yrs to do it again because I was so scared of going back to PND - my kids are now 16, 7 & 5 so a big gap for this reason but it just didn't happen with last 2 at all - all together a different experience.|`|HXW4i5Ajaa	OK, I'm a dad, but being a bloke I'll stick my oar in!    PND is AWFUL. It is a time when you are supposed to be happy, yet you feel like cr@p. You feel like you are the only one like that. The news is you are not.    Nappies, Crying, Feeding etc all lead to a tired mum at an emotional time. PD is remarkably common. Take all the help you can get.    Has your health visitor done an Edinburgh test? Have you seen your doctor about the depression? If not get there now. Your doctor has access to some things your health visitor may not - like medication. I am not saying you need it, but don't be scared if the doctor suggests it.    One thing that can help is finding other people who are in a similar position. I am reliably informed that knowing there are others in a similar position helps.    Ask your health visitor if ther are any support groups in the area. Near Wigan there is PANDA - http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/pandagroup/in... - while that may not help if like a distance away, it gives an idea of the support groups out there.    There is also a book on the subject - Eyes Without Sparkle by Elaine Hanzak. Either buy a copy or borrow it from your library.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	sweet heart call her if you need her even if it's just to talk she will come out to you that's what she is there for.  and just because you call her it doesn't make you a bad mum it doesn't mean your failing     if any thing it means your succeeding because you know you need help and you asking for it and facing it head on.    just call her tell her your feeling low and need a chat.  when she comes out to you and if you feel better well just still talk to her any way explain to her why you needed her.    Is there any way your parents could take baby for a couple of hours so you can get some rest and sleep even if they come and sit at your house at least you can rest and you wont be alone    no one will judge you because you are only doing what you need to do you are looking after your baby and yourself     many of us have been there my health visitor came out to me 3 times a week because i struggled it's ok things will get better and easier in the end    love to you all   x  x|`|H0fXySX9aa	hun if you need help ask for it   that is what she is there for don't feel your bugging her she would rather you phoned and talked to her   good luck and congrats on your baby|`|hvu6Z8dnaa	This is a difficult one to judge because obviously you are feeling very low at the moment.  You say that you just feel that you need someone to talk to so maybe the best solution would be to wait til Tuesday, as you say you'll probably feel better by the time she gets out to you.  Explain on Tuesday that you do feel a lot better but you feel that you could do with someone to talk to, maybe someone who has been through similar situations to what your going through, and ask her if she can suggest a mums and toddlers or a support group that you could take your baby to.  I know how hard it is, I had PND after my last baby and I had a great health visitor who made sure that we got through it with all the help and support we needed.  She came to see me every week for a few months and set me up with a group of other mums that were suffering with PND.  It does get better, I promise you.|`|d72e94984953b49e82f21c2dc27b5d1baa	She gets paid for you to bother her. Contact her. If she knows that you won't hesitate to contact her then she knows you are a responsible mum who will call if she has a problem. If you feel better before she gets there then great.   You are tired, and not feeling well. My health visitor used to say that sleep deprivation is a form of torture outlawed by the Geneva convention but used by babies. Mine screamed for 12 weeks solid.    Call her now.    And I hope you feel better and get some sleep, you're doing a smashing job.  Sod the housework, eat and sleep as much as baby allows you. Remember all you need to do at the moment is feed baby, keep baby clean and warm and loved and look after yourself. Nothing else matters.|`|uVuYdcRcaa	Hi,    (((BIG HUGS)))    Sweetheart, she is there for you. She told you to ring if you needed to speak to her this week.    I feel it would be more helpful to you if you were to ring her - she may pop in for a coffee and come and see you or talk to you on the phone to try and make you feel better.    I have found a link for a site where you can get some support from others going through same thing ...    I have included the link for you sweetheart.    Remember you not alone and no one will take your daughter away from you - they all want to help you.    http://www.veritee.net/pniasp/Organizati...    Lx|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	First thing. You are not a bad mum!    My daughter is 2 and I understand about leaving them. I struggle letting her dad (my boyfriend) taking her out for some one-on-one on a friday. But it does give me some 'me' time.    Have you been told about Sure Start? It is somewhere you can go where your daughter can play (even at her age) and you get some company from adults.    Don't worry about your daughter's cold, mine gets them every few weeks.    If you are worried talk to your health visitor and ask them about places you can take your daughter. I don't have post natal depression, but do have depression (since I was 13). I find being stuck in the house all the time makes it worse.    Remember to look after yourself.|`|wHVx9HZVaa	Ring her!  I was in the same boat as you with my first child and suffered PND for about a year.   The smallest things can make you feel awful and knock you back into depression. You NEED to talk to someone who will listen to you. Do not try and struggle through by yourself this is an illness not something that you can pull yourself together from. Ring her as much as you need to whenever you need to. They would much rather spend time with you at home than have to commit you. That is their job! If you feel better then that is fine too. No one should get annoyed at you for feeling better. PND is like that, one minute you are up then you hit rock bottom again.     PND is an awful thing to go through but trust me you will come out the other side of it. You must make the most of any help that you can get from whoever offers.  If you need to talk then let me know and I will give you my email.  x|`|a35650a2d4dd8438b175c12703752380aa	Sorry you feel so bad, get on the phone and tell her how you feel that's what she's there for i doubt very much she will judge you in any way she knows you and knows what's wrong just get it off your chest,I think she'd rather did something than nothing you don't want to make your self worse just give her a call and tel her your feeling unsure cna she help,hope that eveything works out and your feeling a bit happier|`|uP08b6K4aa	You MUST keep accepting the help you're offered given your difficult circumstances at present.    It's your first baby, you need help and support and I urge you take it, you're not a burden to the Health Visitor, that's what they're paid for.  I had PND also on my first and found it extremely difficult some days to cope, as much as I loved my child, I wanted to crawl up in a ball and tell the world I wanted to get off this ride and just get some sleep!    You're having a hard time of it sweetheart, please please please get in touch with her, she'll offer you so much support and make you realise that you're not a bad mother, that you really ARE doing a great job and this stress will pass sooner than you think.    Good Luck and let us know how you get on x|`|tZt7fUYYaa	My health visitor always said to me that i could call her or any of the other HV's anytime if i felt i had any problems or questions, they have an out of hours answering service too so can always be contacted. You aren't failing as a mother, having a baby ios really hard. mine is 2 months old and i really wanted her and when she came i cried for about 2 weeks as i was so tired and she also developed a cold at 3 weeks and i felt like it was all my fault and she couldnt breathe etc....but i know that no matter how hard it is your daughter loves you and depends on you. You are the centre of her world and are doing the best you can. Call your Health Visitor, if she is a good one she will do her best to advise you and help you with your feelings. I filled in the PND form last week and felt that some of the questions i probably lied about a bit as i didnt want to look like a bad mother, but i know my HV is there for anything i need to know. I also hate my child being looked after by someone else, unless its her dad, and i left her for an hour or so to go to docs for contraception talk and felt awful. Its normal what your feeling, trust me I feel the same, apart from the post baby problems, mother hood is seriously hard.|`|hieQHR0daa	Your Health Visitor could be your greatest support. Unfortunately this service is quite stretched and it can be difficult to give as much time as one might want to support families. HV's are generally not judgmental and most accept that younger mums need more support. You are a good mum and no doubt your HV thinks so too. Everyone needs a little extra help at some time in their lives. Do speak to your HV she knows where you can get additional help and support if and when you need it. She is on your side. While it is admirable to try and be independent there is absolutely nothing wrong with looking for a little help and advice.  Health Visitors are no in the business of removing children from their parents they are there to help, support and advise and to organize additional help and support where it is required. Your HV will be with you, unless you move outwith her area, until your child is at school and beyond. Invest some time in getting to know each other and building up trust. It is well worth it. I think she was telling you that you seemed better and praising you so I do not believe you have anything to fear. PND comes and goes, some days are always better than others.
782343119cddb699707bd00049d73fe9aa	I had pretty extreme constant itching and so did my cousin-in-law. Although, it was later in the pregnancy.  I personally have not heard of anyone having it as an early sign, but that doesn't mean it's not!     Could it be that your skin is just a little more dry than usual from the winter weather?     Good luck!    EDIT: I just found this site, that says, Yes, it can be an early sign. Are you showing any other pregnancy symptoms?|`|0uhRgfcsaa	never heard of it early on. i know i was miserable around 30 weeks. id definatly talk to doc. is it just itching, or do you have a rash of some sort?|`|HP1pToMOaa	Yes I did in the first 2 months.

iVcaB9h7aa	"India. Single women should be under 45; maximum age difference between mother and child is 43 years. Single men may also apply to adopt boys 4 years old and older.     Single men cannot adopt girls by law."    My browser crashed and I can't find the link where I copied the above information.  But there has been a consistency in the information I found.    "In India, an Indian, Non Resident Indian (NRI), or a foreign citizen may adopt a child. There are specific guidelines and documentation for each group of prospective adoptive parents. A single female or a married couple can adopt a child. In India, a single male is usually not eligible to be an adoptive parent. An exception to this rule is the noted dance instructor Sandip Soparrkar, who has recently adopted a young boy. This is a special case rather than the norm. A single man desiring to adopt a child may be eligible if he applies through a registered agency. However, he will still only be able to adopt a male child. "  http://www.indiaparenting.com/adoption/4...|`|TTS9cvUmaa	markomib and BLW_KLM gave you absolultely accurate and great answers.:-)    Yes let me reiterate Single guy can adopt a boy not a girl. Go to www.cara.nic.in for the rules and regulations.    Kaiteskaite- Not sure what do you get out of being so rude. This is not America where private adoptions are required. Especially millions of children/babies in the orphanage and streets . A Indian PAP DOES NOT have to look for a child to buy with those odds.    ETA- First Westerners ought to be able to pin point where exactly India is on the map before answering question that relate to India coming from another Indian. BTW, why do you"assume"this is an International adoption. User with a name "Ashok"can ONLY BE AN INDIAN !!    And calling out people maybe against yahoo rules ........so is being snarky and "not answeing" a question (It goes under....not a question nor an answer category violation".    ETA2- Ya a guy who asks question about hindi songs, bollywood numbers, buys laptop in rupees not dollars (according to his questions in profile) or Euros is doing Int adoption. Sure !! LOL !!First get some knowledge about India before responding and getting all snarky.    ETA  - "but I refuse to answer a stupid question with a serious answer. " I don't think this questioner was begging for you to answer.     And what is an intelligent question according to you------oh that already has all responses within the question ofcourse. LOL !

Unless the requirements have changed in the last 5 years I think you can.  I know of a gay man from here who adopted a 8 year old child from India in about 2004.

The courts don't really go for that,they prefer a couple to adopt.|`|x97x8dVXaa	In response to its not natural etc., would it be better for the child to remain orphaned in india the rest of their life?  There are single parents everywhere - mostly divorce of course, but spouses die.  By this guy's logic, if your spouse dies, you should put your child up for adoption in response.      I have seen single people successfully adopt, both single males and females.      I would ask you to candidly consider your motivation for why you want to adopt.  But there are plenty of married people who adopt and are horrible parents.  And there are plenty of people who make babies who have no business raising a pet, let alone another human being.

x97x8dVXaa	it may depend somewhat on what agency you are going through - but it really should not be a strike against you and here is the underlying reason why:  1.  if you were abused as a child, this was not a fault of yours or a consequence of any action or malfeasance on your part  2.  being able to identify areas where your physical or mental health may be impaired and taking appropriate measures to repair those impairments is a good thing  3.  for the sake of the child, and your own mental health, you should not attempt to hide or misrepresent any fact about yourself through the process - it is better to start with clean hands and know you've fully disclosed any issue   4. i think you might be surprised how many people have worked with a counselor or therapist at one time or another.  if it barred people from adopting only a very small number of people could adopt|`|kf7XLE8kaa	I don't know about infant adoption or international adoption, but when adopting from foster care, it is actually seen as an asset.  If you've been through so much, and not only survived but thrived, then you are better equipped than the general population to be able to help a struggling child through his/her own issues.  Someone who has never struggled is going to have a tough time identifying with a struggling child, and they won't be as understanding.  This generally causes more problems for the child who ends up feeling like something is "wrong" with him.    Just do your research, get prepared for the possible struggles adoptees may experience, and go for it!  Having survived so much, you could be a tremendous asset to a child who needs an understanding parental figure.|`|BTuFtui3aa	No, it's not a negative mark. It's actually generally viewed positively that you saw a need for therapy, and got it. It would only be a negative mark if you hadn't gotten help, and even then, the concern would just be whether you were currently emotionally able to handle parenting without dealing with your own issues first. Having been abused doesn't make you less qualified to adopt, as long as you've processed your own trauma first.    An abuse victim having sought therapy would not be seen negatively at all. (And in fact, if you were doing foster care adoption, would probably work directly in your favour, since you would have a unique understanding of childhood trauma and how it affects kids.)|`|AA11579991	It didn't  effect my adoption at all.  I was also able to verbalize what happened and the steps I've taken over the years to deal with the trauma.  My past physical abuse didn't hurt my adoption as well.  My agency understood that it was a legacy that I didn't want to continue on to my child(ren).      I think if any serious issue comes to light during the adoption process and you have not yet dealt with it - it could (and should) be a problem.  Raising a child is hard work - get your head together, as much as possible, before proceeding.     Best of luck to you.|`|29f92985b9fb483985c8c89cbc7a99b3aa	I was in therapy due to childhood abuse by a family member. I was very up front about my healing journey with my adoption social worker. She spoke to my old therapist (I had been done therapy for almost 10 years when we applied to adopt), and that was that. There was no problem with it as far as the adoption was concerned.   On a side note, I do think that because I was up front about it, and by the fact that I sought out therapy at such a young age and worked through the healing process, my adoption worker was not concerned. Had I not received therapy, I doubt that we would have been able to adopt.|`|XW2Bvwfcaa	Not al all; however, they generally do not want the person who is looking to adopt to still be going to therapy.  They want to know their wounds are already healed, so they in turn can help the foster child's wounds to heal.
gWoZYpX6aa	See your OBGYN as soon as you can. I don't think that this is necessarily anything serious, but it's always get things that seem abnormal checked out right away with pregnancy. If one OB can't seem to find anything, or you are not happy with the results, never rule out the option of getting a second opinion.     Best of luck to you, sounds like you've got your hands full. I'll be sure to say a prayer for you tonight.|`|5dfde4242efae0bef67fb9df5b76b4bdaa	I think you are fine---just pregnant, and the body goes through so many changes as you know.  But having said that, this isn't the time to just query Yahoo for answers, but to visit your doctor, which you probably are doing regularly, I hope.  When you say your iron levels are fine, I hope that means you have been seeing the doctor, but go again--just to be safe, and explain your weariness.  You have your hands full being pregnant and also caring for a precious young one, so see if you can get some help from a friend or relative.

Pregnancy should not make you feel like that.   Are you eating well?   That means no sugar!!! Or coffe! Or dairy!! Or vinegar.. or medicines..  Are you eating lots of greens...?

There is nothing wrong with you.  I was like this when I was pregnant.  All I wanted to do is sleep.  I would wake up in the morning tired.  I would go to work and about 3 ish, all I wanted was a pillow.  I even feel asleep at my desk one day which I have never done ever before or after.      My second pregnancy was a nightmare and I was very sick (Not with the pregnancy but every cold that was around I got and I was sick for months) and I was sleep about 15 hours a day with about the same age child and no one to help me.  We worked it out.  I got a VCR that did not have a record button on it and taught him how to use it.  Not the great mothering time but we made deals that he could only do this or that if I was asleep.  He not allowed to be anywhere except the living room if I needed a nap and I blocked off the livingroom and child proofed it and had his toys in it.      Most of the time, he would be watching a disney movie when I was asleep and would be sitting on the other side of the couch or laying with me watching a movie.  We made this deal because he did not want to be in the portable crib when I napped.  Before we worked it out, he would have to stay in the crib until I woke up and he hated the crib.  But I had to sleep.  The only big issue was that potty training went back to not happening and he was in diapers until his sister was born.    But if I had the money that I have now, I would get someone in daily to take the older child to the park or something so that I could get the sleep.  Or do you have any other mothers in the area that you could ask if he could come along with them and you will exchange time with them after your pregnancy or on Friday or Saturday night when they need a night off.  Or a teenage who can come by after school for you.|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	theres nothing wrong with you. your body is just tired because its working for two now!!  :)

5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	hi   i too have a baby in the same age range (12 weeks) its normal for them to wake up every two hours for feeds BUT if u want her to go straight back to sleep then, keep the lights dim, don't talk to her AT ALL at night and do not change her nappy!! when she starts making funny noises (before she starts crying) tell mum to pick her up gently and put her straight to the breast, then gently put over ur shoulder to burp her, once she has burped wait a min or so and then put her down, This works a treat for me (she keeps her eyes shut through the whole process!) and i too co sleep and breastfeed!  also try to feed her straight before bed and in the next week she should start sleeping for abt 4 hrs at once (my baby girl sleeps for 4 hrs then she is up for feeds every two hrs)  good luck !! parenting is hard! :)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I don't think you can start any kind of sleep management this early.  You need to let her develop her own sleep pattern first.  Which she will do over the next  few months or so.  In a lot of babies this involves them naturally shedding a few night wakings of their own accord.  Then you can start to see where the problem is, if there is one, and make a plan.    Hang in there for a little while longer.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	No, I think your baby is too young for that.  I think your baby still needs to eat every few hours and maybe he or she is still confused with day and night.  Good luck!|`|c8e4d8fd8355899e9fd5539fd4f90b3baa	No. Your baby is waking up for food. Feed the kid. My daughter is 9 months old and still wakes up through out the night. Some kids sleep through the night. Some dont. Just some thing you have to live with.|`|0pX1oQAJaa	give them a bath before bed, and feed them before bed, there really is no way until they build themselves up for it.|`|mAsQbiIgaa	At ten weeks your baby will still probably need a feed during the night but should definatley be able to go more than 2 hours without a feed.  At 8 weeks I was breast feeding my daughter what seemed like every minute of the day and night and I was exhausted.      Before you can start extending her sleep times you need to look at her nap times, feeds, bedtime routine during the day.   Once I started having a bit more of a routine the night wakenings reduced and she started to sleep longer.    What are these like for her?|`|AtnRHgBxaa	Your baby is still waking up to be fed. I would wait until at least 6 months old (when they don't need to be fed through the night) until you don't get up with her in the night.  At about 6 months I was a zombie from lack of sleep, so one night i thought, right, I'm not getting up tonight and let my daughter 'cry it out'.  She hasn't woken up in the night since, and i get 10 hours of gorgeous sleep! :D

peQGGFPYaa	You could possibly be pregnant with twins but i wouldn't worry too much every body's body reacts differently to pregnancy. If your mom or grandmother was a twin you have a better chance of having twins. During both my previous pregnancies i gained a lot of weight and looked bigger then "normal". I am also 7 weeks pregnant and 19 i had my 3 year old at 16 my 1 year old at 18 and now I am pregnant with number 3. if you want to talk sometime feel free to email me.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	even with twins you shouldnt be putting on much if any weight this early in  your pregnancy, maybe you are further along then you think, make an appt with your dr as soon as you can.|`|O5WberWnaa	hi hun,it sounds like your bloated to me.  when i found out i was pregnant this time i looked like i was 4months pregnant.  you are going to be fine hun,just enjoy your pregnancy.  if you wanna chat email me  yearsley62@btinternet.
WTWJh3Dkaa	no not at all  I've swallowed a bit of gum, and the only side effects I've had are an insatiable need to cover everything in glitter and a craving to swallow more gum.|`|IDSHUio4aa	Well i used to do it but i heard its hard to digest....dont see no harm tho :D|`|ekAH05qWaa	its unhealthy for anyone to swallow gum! a child especially can choke on it.  how old is your child? if they are too young to understand that they cant swallow gum than they are probably too young to have gum at all!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	No, not at all.|`|7VfWz7zyaa	No. Its ok. It's hard to digest but just a little bit is fine. Just don't let the child have any more until it knows its bad to swallow it.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	No - and yes.  Swallowed gum does not stay in the stomach or cause intestinal problems. That's because our bodies move most materials that can't be digested (like gum) through the digestive system and out of our bodies in a bowel movement.    In rare cases, swallowing a large mass of gum, or many small pieces of gum over a short period of time, can block the digestive tract. Blockages in the digestive system are most likely to happen when gum is swallowed along with other indigestible things (like sunflower seed shells).    I wouldn't encourage it but there's not really anything to worry about..|`|3EqmcGYyaa	Doubt it. I think most children do it at least once....I guess it would be dangerous if it was in large quantities.|`|cRz31MlMaa	All wives tales---- the truth is gum consists of a fiber our bodies can't digest so it will pass through our system along with other wastes. It is not dangerous and has no ill effects.
xXnFx6qLaa	Actually, having teeth doesn't matter.  Yeah, it's easy for me to say that now though, lol.  When Johnny was 8 months I was scared to death to give him anything he'd actually have to chew because he only had like 2 teeth.  But seriously, their gums are stronger than you think!  I started Johnny off on fruits to let him get used to eating foods with different textures.  Then I would give him steamed veggies - like green beans, asparagus, zucchini, etc.  I would cut them up into small pieces.      Just a warning - he is going to gag at first. (Not choke!)  They aren't used to these foods/textures and it's just a reflex that happens.  Don't freak out.      Anyways - get him used to fruits first, then veggies and then meats later.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Cut a banana into thinnish slices - thick enough to grab, but thin enough to mush easily, put it on his tray and see what he does.  I've found with my son that a big bib just restricts his freedom of movement as he's learning to self feed, so I have been putting him in his chair in just his diaper and hopping with him into the shower after.    It's a little shocking the first time they pick something up off a tray, put it in their mouth, chew and swallow it.  But they do.|`|sxImRCT5aa	maybe mash potato i dunno|`|QXSFpMzDaa	Just remember every baby is different.  My daughter was 8 months with no teeth and was eating everything I was besides the obvious like pizza and streak.  She loved bits of apples, bananas, spaghetti, etc.  That being said if he balks at the idea of regular food and only wants pureed than don't force the issue.  He simply might not be ready.  But always give him the option to have what you are having.  There isn't much you can do when he is 8 months, just follow his cues.  And don't make it a power struggle if he doesn't want to eat what you are eating,|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Try things he can pick up with his hands.  Like toast (try buttering it on both sides so it's really soft) try giving him what you eat but just mashed, if he's used to purees just make it a little lumpier than they are, then as time goes on make it lumpier and lumpier until he's eating chunky bits.  Banana is a good thing to give them, you could try chunks of carrot that have been cooked, again so it's not too hard.|`|lGSUToFQaa	i agree with your comment about the kids being over weight cause they watch tv all day,  maybe some mashed potatoes, but since he can eat real food, i'd say chop or thinly slice up some fruit such as pineapples, water melons, bananas etc and try that, maybe some and cereal, good luck|`|TfijWwsYaa	He should not be eating regular food...he should be eating baby food and formula.  Otherwise he will be at risk for being overweight.    EDIT:  FYI, I am not a teenage mother, baby food is meant for babies, he should not be eating other foods for many reasons:  weight, allergies, and choking hazards.  Ask a Pediatrician.   Regular food has too many spices and not enough nutrients for an infant that age, once your baby has a taste for regular food it will be hard for him to eat baby food again.  Even if it is expensive, your baby is worth it.|`|FUOLr64jaa	When Austin was Jacob's age he only ate baby food too.  At around 9 months (I think) is when I started trying to get him to self feed table food.  It took a while for him to want to do it himself but he got the hang of it!  The fact that he only has one tooth probably won't matter - they can gum the heck out of some food!  I think I started with soft fruits and veggies cut up into small bites and also small pieces of cheese and just worked our way up from there.  I know what you mean about baby food costing a fortune!  I think Austin was around 11 months before he was completely off baby food, but that is probably later than most babies.  I kept giving it to him some b/c he liked it so much...  Sorry for rambling - good luck!|`|5rqVTOzmaa	When Aaron was 8 months he was completely switched to table food. He only had one or two teeth, but believe it or not how many teeth they have doesn't make a difference. They aren't using their front teeth to chew, they are using their gums. As for what to feed him, you can give him just about anything you eat as long as it is in smaller pieces. You can start with things like bananas, green beans, mashed potatoes, pasta, etc.|`|0dwVWzLJaa	my 8 month old son only has one tooth and he loves mash potato with gravy or spaghetti. he likes mushy peas and fish fingers mashed up ( i take the bread crumbs off the fish fingers) and my son can chew a bit so he does eat toast and things, bananas are good, anything you can mush to be quite smooth really.|`|VueZ5u9Waa	I don't think you need to worry about him getting "too used" to baby food. He is still a baby so he's fine to eat if for a few more months even, but what I would suggest is trying the 8 month foods, then when he's around 11 or 12 months try the 12 month foods, they have actual pieces of food so he gets used to mashing food in his mouth. And of course you're doing the right thing by giving him new food of yours too so he gets a good mixture of both. But you can still continue the baby food too, at least I did.|`|eZEzf8gfaa	My son is 8 1/2 months old but he has 6 teeth. I just went shopping and got him Vienna Sausages, raisins, fruit cups (mango is really soft so those do well), the yogurt with DHA, Graduate Yogurt Melts, frozen bag of mixed fruit, frozen bag of mixed veggies to steam, shredded cheese. I'll also let him have what we eat...he liked the meat/sauce and a little bit of pasta from raviolis, a slice of bread. He ate the heck out of my soup the other day. I let him have the carrots and celery and a little bit of chicken. He chomps down on bananas.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Here are a few things that worked for us:  - well cooked, slightly mashed potato (sweet potato or whit with shredded cheese on top)  - pastina with shredded cheese  - well cooked green beans, carrots, mild peppers and peas (cut up in bits)  - at 9 months we introduced fish(as per pediatrician)- he loves it  - toast or cut up grilled cheese  - unflavored jello mixed with applesauce and apple juice, cut up in bits  - all natural organic chicken nuggets (forget the name)- he loves them!  - any ground meat  - "french toast" at 9 months (per my pediatrician) I mix 1 egg and about 1/4 cup (or less) of apple juice and add whole wheat bread bits then fry in olive oil- they really are good!  I have found that my son can't really pick up small bits of fruit well (too slippery) so I give him big chunks of banana, apple, peach and he mashes them well with his gums (only has two teeth.)    Also, I saw an answer that recommended sugar-free products. That is not a good idea because they use artificial sweeteners in them. If something has a lot of sugar it is always best to get a plain or unflavored substitute and sweeten it with fruit, juice or agave syrup.     Good luck- if you baby is anything like mine then he will just "get it" one day. My son out of the blue started eating the food on his tray as opposed to flinging it on the floor for the dogs.|`|veO1RXrCaa	I would give my son mashed potatoes and gravy.  And mushed up bananas.  He even munched on macaroni.  I used to feed him off my plate.  By a year old he was eating regular food.  Give him cheerios or rice puff cereal and see how he eats those.  Have you tried those cookies that are basically pablum in cookie form?  They get all soft and mushy as the baby sucks on them.  I gave them to Alexander to get him used to feeding himself.  People are way too afraid to let their baby's grow up and eat real food.  And look most babies sit and eat and poop and sleep.  My son was a fat little man.  Manly due to the fact that a baby is not active.  He lost all that when he started walking.  He is now a lean mean 6 year old.  Another thing that people due that makes me nuts is fret over a baby's weight.  When they look like those poor kids on Maury then you need to worry.  If not leave them alone.  You are doing the right thing. Ignore the naysayers.
giKCTfnfaa	i got acne with my first ...everywhere.  didn't matter what i did to get rid of it, it wouldn't go away! with my second, i got a few dark spots on my face.  i didn't have morning sickness, i wanted to snack all day with both my kids.  these are all things some women have during pregnancy, doesn't mean it's a boy or a girl.|`|ROJans2Taa	when I was pregnant with my daughter, I found I had less symptoms really almost none, it was my first pregnancy though, my second was a boy and I was hungry all the time, and suffered from varicose veins. I do know that breaking out is a complication with pregnancy, it should start to clear up once you've delivered and your hormones start returning to normal. best luck|`|5Ioe0GE8aa	what?|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I was hungry all the time. Broke out everywhere.   It was miserable.    Now with my son, it is the opposite. I have great skin and my hair is amazing. Not hungry and didnt gain much weight.|`|et39TGIsaa	I actually had all that crap when I was prego with my son. My face broke out all the time, and I was afraid to put any topical medicines on the zits, so a friend of mine suggested toothpaste. LOL.  That didn't work either :(.|`|hzlqCBWnaa	i did break out in the face and soooooooo freekin hungry i could just die. :) and they told me its a GIRL!|`|cRz31MlMaa	Not just girls I suffered from skin pigmentation with my boys mine went away a few months after birth but for some unfortunates it last much longer . The hunger is natural I had it with all of mine.|`|O5WberWnaa	yep i had all of that with the baby girl im carring now!  i see food and i eat it lol|`|rTtbyHu5aa	No. My face was really clear.  All the old wives tales about signs if you're having a boy or a girl are all rubbish. Its because everybody is different and their bodies react to pregnancy differently.
qYNCV6L1aa	Please remember that a babies only form of communication is crying. Also keep in mind that he's used to always being in a warm, snug environment (the womb) so being out in the world and not close to mommy is very new to him. Does he have an eating schedule yet like every 2 hours, etc? Most likely he starts crying because he may not be hungry if it's still too soon. Don't force him to eat (and calling him a fool doesn't help) he will eat when he's hungry. Burping a baby also doesn't eliminate gas. Even after burping a baby can still have gas. And get used to sleepless nights, mornings, and days! My son would sleep all day and then be up all night. I was literally getting 3 hours of sleep a day. But that's part of being a mommy and I had no problem doing it. So please be patient with your little one. We all hit that brick wall at some point at this age as we're getting to know baby and what works best for him but sometimes you have to change up your methods if you notice somethings not working. But the number one thing that you can do for your little man is love him and hold him and just be there. Don't think you can spoil him, you're just giving him what he needs.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	How old is this baby?  We've all had nights like this, especially if he is younger than 4 months old.    Edit: At two weeks old, that sounds perfectly normal to be.  It gets easier, but for now you just have to tough it out.  You know that cliched picture of a tired, un-showered new mom in dirty sweatpants?  This is why.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	I think all babies have days like that.  Just do what you can to console him.  He'll eventually tire out from all the crying and hopefully he'll take a nice long nap for you.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	how old is he?Did you think of teething?|`|zrTBz8M6aa	Dont feed him unless he is cryin for food, bcos wen he was wakin the 1st time it may not av been cos he was hungry but bcos hed heard u gettin up. Dont rush to him at every whimper, i no its hard with ur 1st an wen my mum kept tellin me to stop wiv my lil girl i thought i knew beta but the lack of sleep was makin me crabby so i tried wat my mum called cry it out(sounds crule i no) but it worked, i knew she wasnt hungry an checked she dint need changin so was jus cryin 4a cuddle. After almost a week of doin this she was wakin only once 4a bottle then she would go bk over. Try it an see if it works 4u. good luck x ps check to see if he could be teethin bcos that could be y he's crabby x  EDIT- dint realise he was only 2weeks old, dont try this with him yet hes too young. babies wake many times durin the nite dont worry hun ur not doin anythin wrong, if he dont want a bottle or changing give him a cuddle an a dummy but try not to let him fall asleep in ur arm otherwise he prob wont want to sleep in his cot xx|`|dXVA1wHDaa	It's just a bit of a bad night, everyone goes through these with a baby, regardless of how old they are.  You probably did nothing wrong, and he's just a bit fussy today.  Relax about it, sleep when he does during the day to recharge your batteries.|`|HvALvdc7aa	It might be reflux. 2 weeks old was when my daughter started showing signs of it. There is a thing called silent reflux and it burns their throats when you lay them flat b/c the acid comes up easier. Try sitting him up after feeding for 30 minutes and see if that helps.|`|TklfCPh6aa	You got 4 1/2 hours sleep....I'd say that's pretty good!! And how to avoid what...being a parent? Sometimes baby are just fussy...maybe he doesn't like mommy calling him a fool. Maybe he's constipated? Maybe he's cholic?|`|D8LUpQdraa	He could be teething.    Have you heard of pacifiers? Those help quite a bit. :)|`|angW1Lkfaa	I raised two boys and like it or not that's what babies do.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	how old is he? teething and the nipple too small could be factors in him stopping and starting...if not then welcome to motherhood....we all have a lack of sleep at somepoint when it comes to babies and yes they do have bad days like the rest of us|`|xy0W50Lqaa	He could be unwell, possibly teething or comming down with a cold.  My daughter has been unwell and was waking up every few hours during the night.|`|60668e20144a7d7b9a1bd023ec2a40fcaa	Realize- that in a few years he won't even want you around- hold him, love him, rock him all night, pass out with him in your arms on the couch.  You're tired, frustrated, but this phase goes by so fast and then they're independent.  I know it sucks- my DD had colic for the first 7 months of life- I just tried to remember that there will come a day when she won't let me hold her, so I did my best to appreciate her wanting/needing me.  Don't get resentful at your son, he's a baby- he doesn't know why he's crying- from the sounds of it he may be overtired- you being upset can upset him- you have to stay calm and relaxed for him to do the same.  Just think it would suck really bad if something hurt but you didn't know what or why just that you hurt or didn't feel good.  You can't avoid it-
s3OkLl8zaa	No not at all my dear I have Pcos and I have a 4 year old son. It just makes it more difficult and takes longer for us to have children is all. They do help you with it buy giving you clomid etc If you need it. But you could be someone that has it but don't get any problems in conceiving. Do you have the excess body hair like on your upper lip, tummy etc? That can be treated too if you have that but like I said it affects us all differently x|`|iPGxXRHgaa	yes you can still have children... i'm 24 & was diagnosed with PCOS about a year ago... i already have 3 children but have had 4 miscarriages, 2 during last year. PCOS just means your periods may be irregular & that what makes it harder to conceive xx

o3a5f872aa	I think Dahlia and Autumn are the nicest and I don't like Raven because it gives me the image of a great bloody bird rather than a human being.    I would say Kenya is the most common... I see it a lot when I play the Sims 2 on the computer.  Every kid of African origin that I adopt seems to come with the name.|`|HazRHf8Vaa	I think Dahlia is the prettiest  I'm not keen on Raven but wouldn't say i dislike it  I've never heard of anyone called any of those names so they're all special|`|61NKzPzMaa	1 - Autumn  2 - Kenya, Raven & Dahlia.  3 - Probably Autumn - I see that name a lot on this site.|`|nTxImHhJaa	Dahlia is the nicest  I hate Raven.

My favourite would have to be Kenya or Autumn, especially Autumn because it makes me thing of that kind of cool warmth in the evening air and walking through the woods and just being happy.  2. My least favourite is Dahlia, I think this is because of the pronunciation -  lot of people are automatically going to call her Da-lee-ah which means that she will always have to be correcting people.  3. Your names that you've chosen are all quite unique but I'd have to say that Raven is the most common one.|`|6rNfNCYDaa	Raven, I am a male and for some reason, Kenya sounds to africani, Autumn to strange, Dahlia reminds me of the black dahlia murders and raven, the eagle, sounds mysterious, would go perfect if she had black hair !

3iljgiZRaa	love it!! I have two girls and my maiden name is Finley - we were eating at Wendy's right after we had our second one and a family at the next table was talking to their baby and her name was Finley. I was SOOOOO jealous because my dad fought me so hard on the name that I didn't go with it.    I absolutely LOVE it!!!    EDIT - By the way - the baby we saw named Finley was a GIRL.    EDIT  2 - If you want a "Strong name" and you decide not to go with Finley - Bryna means "strong one". It's Irish - you could call her Bryn! :)|`|H7TqK6N1aa	omg don't do it|`|mDkUmEUzaa	Honestly - no - I dont like Finley.  I think of it more as a boys name - but thats my honest opinion.

How about Corinne?|`|34VXCyvVaa	I don't think Finley is a strong name ju|`|igvUbqkyaa	I don't like it, it sounds/is a last name and just sounds too harsh for a girl.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Absolutely not. It is masculine and a boy's name.    There are plenty of "strong" names that are also feminine and perfectly fine for a girl such as Abigail, Elizabeth, and Charlotte to name a few. Why not pick one of those?|`|0uhRgfcsaa	i dont care for it for a girl.|`|FKzFx3mDaa	I really like the name Finley! It can be both a girl and boy name, and be shortened to fin for a nick-name. It seems like a strong name, that can hold its own. I would most definitely name my child finley! I hope that this helped!|`|6BVYDnvSaa	Yea i like the name|`|uhj76Fkpaa	nop,it's a boys name.  try London|`|sGWBjnRraa	in england that is a fella's name.|`|1vi7PX0Faa	Finley is a man's name from Scotland. How about Fenella, Fern, Fernanda, Fernley, or Fidelity.|`|U9nue0uhaa	to be honest, i dont but thats just my opinion....  i like the name Juliet cuz i havent met anyone with that name and i havent met anyone who even knows a juliet, its not a common name but its soooo beautiful|`|qahq9VaNaa	no no not at all a girl's name!    how about felicity?|`|61NKzPzMaa	No     Finley is a masculine BOYS name. It's not a girls name, it's not a unisex name. It's a BOYS name.    Poor little girl.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I think it's a guys name.  No girls wants a guys name.|`|zLeeLVaEaa	Not big on it...sounds more like a boys name.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	do not like it sorry.   Elizabeth  Makenzie  Addison  Kayley  Aleah  Abigail  Olivia|`|5rqVTOzmaa	No, I don't. It makes me think of Huckleberry Finn. Sorry, that's the first thing that came to mind!|`|HaVPD1qfaa	no..i don't like Finley    Taylor, Stevie, Sam is cute for girls too|`|7rIAd6gGaa	It's far too masculine for me. There's nothing pretty about it at all, and I would think she might dislike it as she gets older. Sorry, just being honest!|`|lMFbBKUPaa	Finley is really weird.  I think it's up there with Audio Science and Pilot Inspektor...
LZ3BwE0baa	oh my gosh i am not sure you can, having a child is so important to women (ok not everyone but many) and when you decide you are ready for a child and it doesnt happen as naturally or quickly as you thought, it can be heartbreaking.  I have gone through every feeling sweet, from anger and guilt (i cant give my hubby his baby)and depression and sadness, I dont think i could make a choice to give up, and if i did-- i dont think it would really last.  If you mean just stop charting etc, then that what i do now, im through with BBT charting and dont bother much with opks anymore, as my PCOS meant i didnt ovulate much anyhow.    Now i am just BDing lots as we normally did anyway--not for ttc --just because we are young and in love!! I notice CM changes but since we BD really often it doesnt affect me.    Now im just waitnig for either more surgery on the endo, fertility drugs and IUI/IVF. Have my next appt feb 23rd.  If theres a chnace you may have a problem then never ignore that, you need to be able tyo say to your GP (god forbid hopefully it wont get to this) we have been trying for a year now we need tests/help.    Ok so i am babbling on, lots of luck and love to you xxxx|`|aWWgPkryaa	Plan to do something that will mean falling pregnant will be completely and utterly inconvenient!  Examples below:    Decide to focus on your career and get the next promotion    Start or expand your business    Plan a holiday of a lifetime    Move house    Get married (if not all ready married)    Buy a dog    Start a study course    I have known one or two of the above to work!  (and life still worked out ok for the people involved)    I won't wish you luck as you are giving up ;-)|`|TtutLPsQaa	Well, basically I just sat down and had a long talk with myself. I was so stressed, and hanging on every positive OPK, and so disappointed with BFN pregnancy tests. So now I swim a lot, I go to they gym and workout listening to my music, I play with my dog, and of course I go to classes Mon-Fri and tutor people in writing 3 times a week. Basicallly, I'm busy!! lol.  My hubby and I do romantic dinners and movies together, we're planning a trip to Albuquerque next weekend. I guess..I just decided I wasn't going to obsess. When I would start to think..I'd just say "NO" to myself. lol.  It has helped tremendously!! Good luck :)|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, I have found that if you try to ignore something important your mind won't let you.  A lot of women start journeling, or even blogging about what's on their mind - by working on something you slowly wear it out until it no longer has power over you, I think with trying to conceive you sort of need to do that too.|`|10mOwk0Taa	I got really tired of being stressed about charting and timing everything perfect, so I just decided to have sex whenever I wanted to and not just because I thought I was ovulating.  Also, I didn't completely stop thinking about it and I still prayed for a baby.  : )  The first month I just enjoyed myself, we got pregnant!|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	I dont know i guess i just gave up emotionally after 4years, i started going out and enjoying evenings out and meals in restaurants making friends (a complete un baby friendly lifestyle) and that month it happened!!!!  5 years on i have a 5 year old a 18 month old and expecting number 3 in a couple of months time- after the first falling pregnant wasnt an issue at all with my other 2, my son was conceived quite by accident whilst on birth control and this one was 3months ttc|`|8mchLCQhaa	after 3 years of trying I just was fed up. I quit thinking about it by charting my temps. I just concentrated on that and 3 months later I was finally pregnant. It sounds weird but I was still trying without trying.|`|shKc7lZcaa	We have been trying for  2 since August, I know it hasn't been that long, but I was getting obsessed by it - constantly checking the date, EWCM, etc!  So this month, I decided not to even have a clue when my "fertile window" could be.  I have literally forced myself to not look at a calendar or do any counting of days or keep up with what days we BD.  I know the date my last period started, but that's it.  I also don't pay any attention if I happen to see any EWCM in my panties (sorry, tmi!).  I just ignore it and pretend it's not there.  I have just concentrated on my hubby and our daughter and just BD whenever it strikes us!  I'm sorry you are going through a tough time.  Lots of baby dust and encouraging thoughts to you!!  And of course, lots of luck!    Edit:  If it doesn't happen this month, I'm gonna try pre-seed and see if that makes a difference.|`|2nfMSDiPaa	I wanted ask the same question...:)lol|`|rKmMyRRiaa	well for one i didn't have a job so was sat at home just thinking about it all the time i was and still at university but only 2 days a week so the rest of the days i was thinking about it none stop.     so i thought i should get a job, got the job i started to go out with friends and my hubby more and i just forgot all about.     i still take my vitamins and drink lots of green tea, i dont let it controll my life there is no point i have sex when i want i dont even use ovulation sticks anymore    so the main thing is just to keep yourself busy. It seems to be working for me as i said before i feel so much more better within myself i personally think stressing was making my body ill now im having faith in god and it will happen when it happens     I know its easy to say but just GIVE UP dont try have fun with life and im sure it will happen as you said you have taken up card making that's good but try doing something with your partner friends and family!     hope ive helped hun xxx|`|cKgMnCELaa	half of it is simply the routine of doing it.  try going through the routine but replacing it with something else.  a friend of mine used plain tobacco and it worked for him.  keep it up you can do it|`|mhhwuLsRaa	i no its nearly impossible when u say you want to give up and u cant!    a few months back i started to buy wedding magazines and started to obsess about the perfect wedding at that time not 1 baby thought went through my mind but sill no luck but my wedding isnot for another year or 2 so i stopped obsessing so then the baby thoughts came back    i hope this helped    babydust x|`|MHNFnBzgaa	i don't no but you just do, we was trying for 1 year and 5 months and we just bought our 1st house and we just stopped trying and put our minds to the house and believe it or not i got pregnant but i sadly miscarried at 6 weeks....4 weeks after i found out i was pregnant again and we were not trying..we now had a healthy 6 month old son.|`|OPtZbklzaa	honestly, you don't! i'm in the same boat! you just can put it out of your mind because it's something that you want so bad that you can taste it! i know hun, it's sooo hard especially if everyone around you is preggo's or just had a baby! i hate this!! it makes me soooo upset sometimes! GL and tons of babydust your way and mine!
F8iYNurEaa	Don't assume you are not ovulating just because you haven't seen any EWCM and the OPKs aren't detecting your surge. I used OPKs when I first started trying to conceive and it didn't pick up my surge at all. I was also charting my BBT that month so I know for a fact I was ovulating as my temp rose on day 18 and stayed high until I got my period. The OPKs just didn't work out for me. As for EWCM, I have never ever noticed this during my fertile time, let alone any other time. Despite this I managed to get pregnant within 3 months of ttc (although it unfortunately ended in miscarriage). Don't panic yet.|`|rKmMyRRiaa	aaaww huni i feel for you im in the same boat as you ive been trying for 24 months now so now ive given up i cant be bothered and since giving up i actully feel so much more better. ttc was just taking over my life maybe its a good thing if you give up it mifght just happen, thats the game im playing so fingers cross best of luck just think positive  lots of baby dust xxx|`|MBNpalh6aa	Hi Hun    im not sure if you are ovulating but all the signs have listed are the same as what i get around the time of ovulation!    What brand of OPK's are you useing because i tried first response ones and i could never get a positive with them (also neither could my friend). Hvae you tried BBT? although it doesn't tell you untill after you have ovulated least it would give you some idea and if indeed you are.    Whish you the best of luck x|`|JjBwydymaa	hello hun,    it took my periods 9months (yes bloody 9months) to get back on track. I was on the pill for 5-6 years.     Within those 9months, it was drving me crazy, I was so fustrated because my periods were so irregular. TTC took over my life and its all I did and think about. Im a student nurse and Im now concetrating on my career which is taking my mind of things. I still have sex every 2 days and do get a little excited when i think I could be.... but i dont chart any BBT or CM because it was that was stressing myself out!    You need a hobby and get your mind of it. It will happen hunni...    Good luck xxx|`|RE6GBw0Baa	awww hunni,    u can have a period without ovulating hunni. simply because for you not to have a period there must be an implanted egg, therefore if you dont ovulate then you wont concieve hence a period.     hunni im sure ull be back on track soon, i know the hardest thing si to give it time.    dotn worry hun, i moan waaaay more than u lol.     try opks chick, i am this cycle and im confuddled out my nut lol but it will be worth it xxx|`|xjRCdRnxaa	Hey you poor thing,  Yes you can, as i apparent did hence being precribed clomid.  Its called something like Anovulatory period, so you basically bleed but no eggs flushed out as wasnt released!  I can give you some positive news though  my best friend was on Pill for 10yrs, didnt get a period for 6mths, kept testing hoping you may have still caugt herself before her next period would have been due, then bang, one mth it woked, and she never had her period either, just ovulated finally and caught it - it was 6mths from stopping the pill to falling!  So try and keep positive, it takes a long time for most people to get the pill out their system!  Good luck|`|Ldvi6UPOaa	Hi Cakies,    I'm sorry you are going through this. But to answer your question you can have periods with out ovulating. This is called an annovulatory cycle. This is when yoy have a period but you did ovulate. Some women shed their  uterine lining even though they didn't ovulate. I would suggest you go talk to your doctor maybe they can run some test to figure out if you are ovulating. If you are ovulating and don't have the EWCM then maybe you need Preseed to help with that.    Good luck hun!!!|`|jaP0TANdaa	I'd say ovulation is probably still on the way... assuming there are no underlying problems from the pill or that the pill was "covering up". I usually feel pretty crappy around the time of ovulation and all the way up to AF! It's not possible to have a "true" period without ovulating. What usually happens is "breakthrough bleeding" because the uterine lining builds up so much that it can't sustain anymore and you bleed. It's not a "real" period because your bleeding isn't caused by a change and subsequent drop in hormones. Hopefully you'll get your positive OPK soon and your problems will be solved. When are you testing using the OPK's? I can't get a positive OPK unless I test really late in the evening (like 8pm) and limit my fluid intake. Good luck to you!

xue72D76aa	I drank decaffeinated beverages (which still contain caffeine).  In the beginning of the pregnancy, I was weaning myself off coffee so I drank about 2 cups in the morning of decaf.  Towards the end of the pregnancy, I'd drink a cup a week.  I cut out soda, although I'd have one every few weeks when I'd crave a Pepsi :)  I haven't heard about caffeine affecting sleep patterns in babies.  I have heard about blood pressure and constriction of blood vessels, but not sleep patterns.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I didn't. It was just easier for me to not have another thing to worry about. Doctors will tell you it's o.k. in small amounts so if you really feel you need it, just take it easy. It is a diuretic though, so make sure you compensate w/other fluids.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i drank as much as i wanted with the other babies because we wasnt told not to then they all 100% no problems sleeping  ive now been told no more than 3 cups a day but will admit some days i have slightly more  in moderation ur baby will be fine, it shouldnt interfere with his sleep x x|`|HVXtd2Ryaa	My doctor told me the same thing, that there isn't enough caffeine to do any damage unless I'm a 10+ mug a day coffee drinker. I drank on average two iced coffees per day and that was it. I'm not sure if it would be connected but my son is 16 months old and is yet to sleep through his first night. It's possible that it's entirely unrelated but if I ever fall pregnant again I'll be staying away from caffeine.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	my DR told me it's ok to drink 2 cups of caffeine (coffee,tea etc) without any problems. i like coffee so i just drink decaf instead|`|ROJans2Taa	I completely avoided anything caffeine, however my sister was pregnant the same time as me and drank 2-3 cups a day, and her daughter slept way more then my son. if I get pregnant again ill still avoid the coffee for other reasons, but not sleeping well, wont be one of them.lol|`|TVz2UoOyaa	NO coz just like you im worried for my baby..|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i drank tea 1 cup a day and she sleeps fine.....that was the guidelines then but apparently you should have none now...in saying that i dont think one cup a day will hurt and i dont see any reason why this would cause sleep problems:) goodluck|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Its ok but to limit it to one drink per day. I drank lots of soda with caffeine in it and my son sleeps fine. For some reason I couldn't drink coffee it made me so sick, but I always wanted energy drinks. Especially Amps they were one of my cravings.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	i drunk coffee,maybe 1 cup every morning, and my little one sleep just fine from 10:00pm to 11:00am since he was 3 weeks old.It's true though that if you drink a lot of coffee your baby will have sleeping problems.|`|z0XRuVwSaa	yeah decaff coffee|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	I drink coffee occasionally, and soda regularly. I never drank soda before I got pregnant, but since it helped with my morning sickness I haven't stopped and now I crave it. Just drink lots of water too. The caffeine can dehydrate you.     My baby isn't here yet, but he's very active no matter what I eat or drink. But he has no problems that we can tell.|`|xGI9z01Maa	I had two babies in Alaska and one in California.  In Alaska, they were no drinking at all but caffeine was not an issue just limit the intake.  In California, the doctors were have a glass of wine but no caffeine.    It's better not to drink caffeine when the baby is inside.  But if you need your morning coffee, then have it.  Just don't drink a pot of coffee very day.  The caffeine will be out of the babies system with in a week of you drinking it.      Each doctor had a different thing to say.  Each mother has a different thing to say.  Best advise is just to listen to everyone advise and use only what is best for you and your situation.|`|GjuRYsITaa	i drink coffee when im having trouble going to the toilet (number 2s) one cup and with in ten Min's im on the loo  as for my kids sleeping all my 4 have slept through the night from they were 4 weeks old|`|TAGsuqu2aa	I drank half a cup a day for 3 days a week since I worked part time during my pregnancy.

She has her daily sleeping routine, naps, etc. No complaints here.|`|1bnhwGACaa	im having my one daily cup right now   most doctors will say 300mg or less is ok   in one cup of coffee it is between 20-100 depending on the brand and size|`|4v90WyUhaa	I didn't drink coffee but I did drink a ton of tea and Mt. Dew. Neither one of my kids have ever had a hard time sleeping once they were born.
HWeajklaaa	it's true for my sister, myself and my four brothers. My sister and i are Daddy's girls and my brothers all still have apron strings attaching them to our mother....I dont know, i've just always been a daddy's girl, maybe it's because i've always seen him as this strong superman kind of guy but who would also sit down and play tea party with me...|`|qItxNgMeaa	Not necessarily. I suppose it might well have been that way with me... except that my father wasn't a wonderful father figure. When I was little I suppose I had the tendency to want to tell him about my achievements etc. because he was more likely to react with adoration, or so I (for some reason) felt.    My brother would have, and still would, I believe, prefer a stronger relationship with our father than our mother - but it probably won't happen. So no, although that SEEMS to be a general rule, it's not necessarily always true.    Anyway, I think this happens because psychologically fathers just seem to adore their little girls a lot and want to spoil them and mothers the opposite - so small children react to that.     As for why THAT is - well, I could go all Freudian and say it's because, deep down, we're all attracted to the opposite sex including our parents, but personally I don't agree with that kind of view. So really, I don't know why it is. (Oh wow, that was helpful).|`|zMNgG9m0aa	we only have girls but all of them prefer me. perhaps there's an age at which they start to work their feminine wiles on their dad? lol, poor bugger, he's got no hope!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	It was true for me.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	my partner says little girls are more loving to their daddys. I dont know why. His daughter likes him better than her mother so she says and our new baby smiled lots at him first before she did at me, which made me cross as im the one who feeds her lol! My BF has two little boys and they are definately closer to their mum than their dad. who knows why though...difficult thing to answer|`|H7TqK6N1aa	i am curious too! people have told me the same but i've yet to read anything of authority on it|`|vGxipYJnaa	My father was harder on my brothers than he was on his daughters - he spoiled us girls so we were all daddy's girls. That's probably why my brothers weren't as close with our father.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	Isn't true in my case..    My 8yr old son ADORES his father and spends a lot of his time with him although I know he loves me too yet my 4yr old daughter hates to be anywhere without me, she doesn't even like staying overnight with her grandparents.  That said my daughters father doesn't want her (openly admitted) and although she calls my partner daddy as he's been in her life since she was 15 months old she's still a total mummy's girl.|`|xOcfOy1vaa	i am closer to my mom.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	yes it's true.It happened to me with my father and now I can see the same thing with my 2 daughters.They just adore my husband even though he's more strict with them.|`|egqveuPjaa	I think it's because Daddys look at their little girl as a princess and pay her attention.  Mammys want to spoil their little man rotten! So naturally the children are going to go to who treats them the best!|`|0uhRgfcsaa	wasnt true for me.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Its true, human nature is behind it.   However it doesnt mean it works like this in all families.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	yes but when they grow matters changed|`|5agXk9ldaa	yes unless they are gay (not kidding)  it is something about finding the other "s  e  x"more attractive|`|34VXCyvVaa	My kids were both closer to me when they were little.  As she got older, my daughter became closer to my husband and pulled away from me.  It's just a way girls have to establishing their identity separate from their mothers.  It doesn't happen in all families, but it does happen in many families.  I'm just glad she has a good father in her life to be close to.|`|ltUzwXZEaa	Because dad,s are more protective of their daughters then their sons not to say that they love one more than the other.They do indeed love them both the same.|`|IDSHUio4aa	Yes it is.

0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	"After you started growing inside of me, your dad realized that he wasn't ready to do all of the things that a dad should do for his kids.  He still had things to learn about life before he would be ready to be someone's dad every day.  So, he's doing the things he needs to do for himself right now & we wish him well in it."|`|uP08b6K4aa	First and foremost, wait until your child asks.  If he asks eventually, you can always say that you're sure his daddy loves him very much but you're unsure as to why he left, there's nothing wrong with telling the truth if that's what it is.  You haven't said why he left so I can't comment much more in that respect.    As long as your son is loved with you and your family, then he'll be fine.  You can't dress anything up, there's no need to, don't blame anyone because it seems you don't know why he left regardless of how needy his mother is or not.  Even if she IS needy, even if he's a light-weight and can't be bothered to be a parent, it's not something your son needs to know.  All he needs to know is that he's very much wanted and loved and that YOU will always be around.    Good Luck x|`|34VXCyvVaa	Maybe you could just tell him that his daddy had to leave to take care of his own parents.  When he's old enough to ask if his daddy will come see him, you just answer, "I don't know."  You can send occasional pictures to his father in hopes that at some point, he will change his mind about being involved in this child's life.  Eventually when your son is old enough to comprehend (maybe early adolescence), you can tell him the truth.|`|hqogf9oGaa	I suggest being as truthful as you can with him albeit keeping it age appropriate.  Your son is still very young so may not fully comprehend a detailed, complex explanation.    Tell him that you don't know why your ex left but assure him that it was nothing to do with your son.  As much as it will hurt or annoy you to say this, it will help your son so tell him that although his daddy isn't around you are sure that he loves him very very much.  This will help assure your son that he didn't leave because your son was on the way.  I know that you will feel that your ex can't possibly love your son as he left you both but having the strength to tell your son that his daddy cares even if he isn't around will more than likely save your son a lot of emotional hurt.    As he gets older then you will be able to answer more questions and tell him details of circumstances at the time.  The main thing is to never scold your son for asking questions as it will make him feel that you are hiding something from him or keeping his Dad from his somehow.    I think the way your ex has treated you and your son is dispicable regardless of whether his upbringing was less than perfect.  Everyone has to make choices in life and he could have chosen to be different to his parents and give his son a happy childhood.    I understand that you have been hurt in the most horrible way but you will learn to trust and will take that little leap of faith when you are ready.  Like you say you have your son to consider now however, you can date without introducing a man to your son until you feel there is a future in the relationship.    Good luck for the future!    Indigo    xxx|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Tell him his daddy went away before he was even born because he wasn't ready to be a daddy and that neither you nor he did anything wrong. Tell him that you love him very very much and that families come in all sorts of different ways. Some have both mommies and daddies, some have just a mommy or a daddy and that is okay.|`|SsfnitjXaa	There is no reason why he can't start having some kind of relationship with his father now.  Start sending emails to the guy (from your son) telling him what he did today and include pictures.  Short, cute and informative. Never say anything about you, never send your picture, never ask the man to come visit, never expect an answer back.    Never tell your son he was abandoned... because he was not, you were.  Make it as open as possible for the bio dad to be around (never have a boyfriend around or live in the house) if he should ever want to.    There is nothing wrong with a man asking for a DNA test if he is being asked for support money, matter of fact it should be mandatory with every birth if you ask me. 20% of the people in the world do not know who there real bio father is.     Most dads are not in their child's life.  Most have to work long hours, some live in other countries.  You child can have male role models in his life via uncles and grandfathers.|`|bDiPIj3eaa	jus tell him his dad has gone away for a bit and then think about wat to do next|`|uhj76Fkpaa	Tell him the truth.He deserves it.Don't try to dress it up.He'll grow up eventually and find out on his own about his father if he wishes to.Despite the fact that he will feel sad about it truth is the only thing that can't hurt him more in the future.Good luck|`|AA10529334	I would tell the child that Dad went away and you don't know why.

I will say he at least does that, but the other 364 days of the year I have to explain to my son why he isn't around.  I simply tell him that his daddy loves him.  I do tell him that his daddy pays his child support and I have explained to my son what that is for.  I also tell him that his daddy has long work hours and just can't make it here to see him much.  I reassure him that his daddy loves him, even though he doesn't phone him, show up, do what he says...for my son's peace of mind I don't say anything bad about his dad.  When he's older he will realize that I was trying to keep him from hurting and he can confront his dad himself.  What goes around come around.  I guarantee you that my son's dad and your child's dad will not lead a successful life and probably never be happy.  Karma will see to that.  Any person who runs off and has nothing to do with the child they created will never lead a happy successful life.  Don't say bad things to your child about his father.  For one he's only a toddler and probably won't question too much.  When he's a little older and can understand then maybe you can explain a little further.  Just make the best of it and don't talk bad about the father.  When your child is old enough he will know on his own that his father is a piece of crap, but that's for him to figure out on his own.  Degrading the father is never a good thing, it will in fact make your child feel even worse about the situation.  Good luck.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	don't tell him any thing wrong about the father and take care of the kid|`|T0pkW783aa	Tell your child that you love him very much and always will but had chosen a man who you loved and who you had hoped would be in his life.  Tell him that his father was not able to be what he needed to be: a father: (something your son deserved) and that he chose to go away and not be a part of his life or a part of yours.  Tell him that you were very sad but knew that you could provide for your son and that you would always be there to love and nurture him.  Let him know that you wish it could have been different and that it has nothing to do with him that his Daddy wasn't able to do what Daddy's do.  Let him know in time that his Dad had a troubled childhood which made him feel that he wouldn't be a good Dad.  Let your child know that he is wonderful, the joy of your life and that you will always be there for him, no matter what.  One day, you may find a wonderful man to become the Dad that he didn't get at birth.  (I have two grown sons whose father left me when they were very young.  It was a challenge but I didn't poison them about their Dad and he does now get in touch with them on occasion.  My boys do not feel cheated; they know they were loved and that I did the best I was able to do for them.  People make choices regardless of the background they have had.  Do your best to surround your child with loving people, good values and the security of a loving home.  Your child will feel loved and protected regardless of if there is a father in your home.   Many children deal with divorced parents and some who don't see them at all or very rarely.  They grow up feeling loved without feeling the sense of abandonment you are worried about.  You can do it and will be happy when your son grows up and thanks you for being the wonderful Mom that you are.|`|prqrQcd1aa	As a person who was abandoned by her father, and as a mother that has a child who is 3 who has never met her real dad i will answer you this.  First thing is never talk crap to him about his dad. What you said would be just fine, your dad wasn't ready to be a father... I say this because when i asked about my own father when i was younger i was always told nasty things, my mom always got defensive about it and turned it all around on him why he wasn't there for me. When i got older i went and asked him those same questions and he was actually honest with me about things, didn't get defensive.   My 3 year old has a father that has never seen her either. She is calling my boyfriend daddy, and we are both fine with that because we have both known each other for 18 years... her father pays child support and is a very good father to his other children, but says he doesn't want to have anything to do with our child together because he doesn't want to "hurt" his other children. He pays child support as well.   I've often wondered what i'll say to her, when i'll say it to her (as she may not even know when she gets older, she's been calling someone else dad for the past year). What age i'll tell her and so on. But i do know that i will tell her the truth, and she can make her own decisions about how she feels about him.|`|giKCTfnfaa	my kids father left right after i had my youngest child.  he was in infant so he has no memories of him. however, my oldest was 5. he knows the details of what went on.  he even knew the woman who was making frequent visits to our home while i was gone.  he hasn't told his brother the story...and i've asked him not to.  as far as my youngest goes, i've told him sometimes moms and dads can't get along and it's best they stay away from each other. i've tried my very best not to put down their father in any way, shape or form in front of them.  later in life, they might decide to have some sort of relationship with him.  i'm not going to influence them either way.|`|iq5uwobOaa	The Truth. YOu don't know why.  You never know he may want to be back in the child's life.    If you know the address for the sperm donor (sorry that is what I call men that leave the woman like that)  Send him updates of his son.      He may just come around and want a relationship with his son.|`|5AwLW1buaa	You must never, EVER badmouth his dad in front of him. When some dads are really bad, it is tempting, but the damage it does is irreparable. As much as it hurts, always present his dad either neutrally or if you are brave enough) positively.    I think you kinda have to be honest.. "Daddy and Mummy don't live together no more, but we both still love you very much.", "Daddy has to live somewhere else but he will still see you." are examples, I think, would be good. Again, lying to him, saying that "Daddy is working away" or such like is negative and will cause problems.    You can only do your best. But don't introduce hatred and prejudice in your son in his crucial, formative years. Good luck.|`|hjxIm8RWaa	don't let your child think it is anything to do with them, his father didnt even know him before he left, so it is not personal. Say that your sons father was a selfish person, but dont be negative and spiteful about the father, because eventually your son will begin to resent having any part of that man within him. Tell your son the good things about his father, and that he chose to leave, which is neither of you two's fault. Im sure that with friends and maybe your brothers (if you have any) and your father, you can give your son a good male influence in his life.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	You must not lie to him.  If you do, he will certainly find out as he grows up, and he won't forgive you.  Just give him the bald facts, as few as you can, and leave it until he asks again. "Daddy went away and we don't know where he is."  Make sure he doesn't expect his father to turn up, or you will be setting up dreadful disappointment for him.   Then, maybe, " Daddy doesn't want to be with us  -  I don't know why."  In cases like this, I am always astonished that the father's parents do not wish to be proper grandparents to their grandchildren. They will be missing a great deal, and it is the child's father who is denying everybody this relationship between the geenrations|`|qItxNgMeaa	When my father was kicked out I was in Year 3, so obviously I couldn't really grasp what was happening. I don't exactly remember what my mother told me, but I think it was something along the lines of "Mum and Dad don't really get along anymore - it's not your fault and Dad will still be coming to see you, he just won't be staying here anymore". (Obviously this isn't exactly similar to your case but some things still apply).    She didn't place the blame upon herself (or, since I was a kid, I would have blamed her too) since she wasn't responsible, and she made sure I knew it wasn't my fault, so I've never blamed myself either. Just tell the truth, gently, and editing it slightly to better suit the ears of a toddler - don't throw blame around either, because small children are impressionable. If questions like "Didn't he love me?" come up - well, I wouldn't really know what to do, but answers along the lines of "I don't know but it's not your fault" or "It wasn't your fault, it's not about that" might work?    Also, soften the blow; having a favourite film on in the background, or watching it after the explanation, might soothe nerves (I had "Lady and the Tramp") etc.    I've been on the receiving end, and that was what seemed to work for me. I can't offer a lot of advice other than that because I've never had to actually TELL someone about something like that. Just be honest but gentle, I think, and reassure your son it's not his fault (but don't take the blame either - especially considering it's not your fault!).|`|KSAbA57Haa	I feel for you and your son and wish you well.  A couple thoughts, even if the things you say about the nofather are true I hope you can satisfy your son's questions without placing a burden on him.   I think you exhibit smarts and common sense and will explain everything he needs to know in due time by starting slow or very basic then expanding on those answers as time goes on.|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	whilst he is young and if he asks I would just say "not all children have daddies but your daddy is out there somewhere but you dont know where.  Be honest dont slag him off to him as when he grows up it could give him a more intense feeling of rejection, When he grows up if he wishes to track his father down explain with no nastiness just the facts that he walked out but you will help him find him if thats what he wants.  Things are never easy when a parent walks out, the very best thing you can do is give your son an open mind (there fore a more innocent one)|`|M1rhdtQDaa	Tell him his father went away and you are not sure why. You don't need to hurt him and you don't want him to hate his father. He may have some connection with him in the future and if you turn your son against him it will back fire on you. It is up to his father to explain to him why he left you guys. Let him be the bad guy. Your concern needs to be your child's emotional & mental health. If his dad is an a@@ he will eventually figure that out on his own. Don't steer him in that direction. When your son gets older if his father never comes to see him and he ask about him you can give him answers that are age level appropriate for him to understand.  Regardless of what kind of man he is or how he treated you, your son will still get some of his identity from his fathers memory. Just tell him he had some problems that were difficult for him to deal with. Don't let this mans rejection of you influance his sons view of him. You can move on from this and date another. You don't have to bring a man around your son until you have gotten to know him for a period of time. My first husband died. I had a son from him. I did not date for 5 years. When I did date I never brought the guy around my son until I knew it was serious, then I married that guy. Still married 20 yrs later.|`|q1cqgVVSaa	well that would be very hard to say it to the boy since is young and he might have bonded with his father. if he is like 3-7 tell him that his father will be gone for a long time and you don't know when he is coming back.(i mean you'd want to be as close to the truth as possible!)if he is 8-15 you can tel him the truth. but pls be sensitive!  good luck!|`|4v90WyUhaa	Don't lie to him. My oldest son's father left me when I was pregnant and we were engaged. I never heard from him after that. He was killed 3 months after my son was born so he's never known him or anything. I never talk bad about him to my son even though he was an a**. My son has always known the truth. The way me and my family see it is we have enough love for him to make up for his father not being there. You can't sugar coat the reason why a sorry daddy isn't there. Truth is always better with a kid. If you lie and later he finds out what you said is wrong then he'll doubt everything you say growing up.
wiAVa1H5aa	It's when they (the kid) engage in play on their own without your prompting.   Ideally a child doesn't watch too much television get too much time in front of a computer as that will inhibit spontaneous play, most healthy kids will play without having a parent or care giver direct play.       My kids will start building forts out of couch cushions, start jumping, pretending to be something they are not, running around, singing, climbing outside, using their toys appropriately, and pretty much from the time they wake up to the time they go to sleep is spent playing, even when they are eating they tend to play.

This is about your baby and thats the most important right now. When i had my miscarriage it started off as cramping and bleeding then eventually i passed the clots. with this pregnancy i spotted at 7-8wks then again with bright red blood at 11wks with cramps and now im 20wks along. so anything is possible dont be so quick to judge and go to the ER. your old enough to have a baby you need to be responsible enought to go to the DR or ER. goodluck|`|SjYbkWdQaa	some break through spotting not a worry right now, you were on the pill remember that...if you start to kneel over in pain, and the bleeding gets heavier, go to the ER im sure your family will understand..i dont mean to sound mean...but if you do misscarry, maybe its a sign...    next time take your BC pills correctly. and remember diahrrea within an hr of taking the pill, taking antibiotics, and certain herb supplements cancel out the pill. be safer with taking your pills later in the future.|`|O5WberWnaa	the only way to tell if your having a m/c is to go and see the doc or go to a&e so they can assess you.....i bled with my son 3yrs ago at 9wks and he was a healthy 9lb 8oz.  good luck x|`|CP1zxDLiaa	It will be hard for both you and your boyfriend with a miscarriage.

You just may not be noticing them|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	with my first baby i didnt have  any thing at all, the only way i and ppl could say tat i was pregnant was coz i didnt have my period and i looked the part...lol everyone is different    ps my labour wasnt to bad and was ova in 10hrs|`|7uVlYPEIaa	I didn't have any Braxton Hicks with my first pregnancy, and my labor was actually the easiest part of having him, the pregnancy I suffered from severe morning sickness for 8 months. I have no idea how he came to be an 8lb + baby, I couldn't keep anything down. He was born at 40weeks 3 days 6 hours of labor and 2 pushes he was here. My twins I was given a drug to put off contractions at 28 weeks, standard procedure with twins regardless of signs of early labor. I was taken off the medication at 36 weeks and had mild contractions off and on and was induced at 38 weeks.

be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	Sperm can be extracted via T.E.S.E. or Sperm Aspiration.    A vasectomy reversal is a waste of money, as he will just have to get a vasectomy again after.    I will spare you the ethical speech.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Yes he can, usually a reverse vasectomy is done and sperm collected.  My husband of 20 years divorced me, married a chick 15 years younger than myself and had this done.  They now have a 4 year old daughter.|`|mhhwuLsRaa	from wat i no he can but the sperm has to be collected from the teste via needel or small proceedure    good luck
t1dBxeyRaa	Wait till you are like 3 days late before you start worrying.     Just the mere stress that you might be pregnant can cause your periods to be late!|`|60668e20144a7d7b9a1bd023ec2a40fcaa	well, if you are, you're far enough along to take a home pregnancy test.  But if you've been freaking out about it- or anything else, that could be why your late- try to relax give it another day, then take a test.  Nothing you can do about it now, so just take a deep breath and just wait and see or pee and see
YzUPmWTBaa	I think you will be absolutely sure if your water breaks, it wont be on your underwear, but on your feet and carpet ;) Ive heard that some woman go through false labor though, so that might be it? If not, I hope your bags are packed incase your water does break, and that you phone your doc as soon as it gets worse. Good luck!

I asked my doctor about it and he said it could be from straining my back and the pain is felt in the front. Sleeping could cause back strain. Especially if your mattress isn't firm, or you moved the wrong way. Good luck!
AA11481889	Wow...now I know what I aspire to be.    By the sounds of it a "helicopter mom" is what they used to just call a good mother.    I think it's important for parents to be involved in every aspect of their children's lives...they are our children after all.    We shouldn't smother them...but I don't' think there's anything wrong with know what's going on with my son and protecting him....isn't that kind of the whole idea of being a parent in the first place?    I mean...we're humans...not sea turtles...who just squirt them out and let them fend for themselves...lol.    Sorry ...too much Diego.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	A parent who hovers over their kid CONSTANTLY, even when they're not kids anymore. They do EVERYTHING for the kid--fill out college applications, job applications, argue with professors and teachers over the kid's grades, etc., etc..     It goes way beyond simple protectiveness.     It's not a flattering term. You can imagine how these kids turn out.|`|L8kPwdA9aa	they hover over their kid and watch their every move...like a helicopter|`|GnXfEdegaa	A mom who hovers over her child (to watch over or protect).  I take it as a little obsessive, over the edge.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	A helicopter mom is a mother who hovers over the child. Like watches every single thing they do, knowing everyone they know, etc. Personally i'm becoming more of a helicopter mom myself, this world is to damn scary not to be a helicopter mom is some form.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Those who hover above their children constantly, by modern definition.|`|fQ7UBgOsaa	Uhm... A larger helicopter? An airport?     LOL helicopter Mom is the kind of Mom who rushes onto campus at any sign of potential trouble for her Mommy's boy (or girl), and generally always is over her child - an annoying overbearing parent.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Always hovers over their child to make sure nothing happens. Like EXTREME overprotectivess.... Think of a really bad stage mom.
bxBN5kyPaa	My daughter had a respiratory infection at about three weeks of age as well. Just use saline drops and instead of the aspirator that comes with the drops get the regular kind in the baby section. It seemed to have better suction than the what came with the drops. Having him in a moist humid room, like the bathroom with a hot shower going is good to clear it out and help break up mucus and congestion. I advise against using anything like vick's vaporub or anything of the sort. I just read articles about studies that have been done that show in kids younger than three it will actually produce more mucus instead of clearing it out like it should.  saline drops and the steamy environment form the shower worked perfect for my baby girl.|`|tWP8GDyGaa	My son had the same problem, but he was about 3months old.  The ped said to use a dropper with a saline solution. Drop a couple drops up his nose then suction.|`|KCe8dKAFaa	My daughter had that too at that age. I propped a folded towel under one end of her mattress to elevate her head, used a humidifier and the nasal aspirator (i never used the saline since her nose wasn't dry anyways). As a paranoid mom, I also put some rolled towels on each side of her to ensure she didn't roll down the slant. Not much else you can do at that age with a cold, but wait it out. It's more nerve racking as a new parent and we hate to see our little ones suffer. Just keep an eye on temperature and my doctor at the time said to listen to breathing to ensure there is no difficulties. I never tried running a hot shower to steam the room, bug I hear that works well too. I think elevating the mattress works best for my daughter. She seems to get a little relief while sleeping that way.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son had a stuffy nose at around this age.  I asked my pediatrician and used the saline drops in combination with the nasal aspirator.  I don't think the nasal aspirator works all that well if you don't use the drops with it.|`|avx7bLnKaa	saline drops do work but you also have to use the bulb to suck out the lossened mucus...    you can also use a humidifier but with only water and salt [according to directions] no medicine    you can also rise the head of the crib by putting a blanket under the mattress to give the baby and incline to sleep on    not much you can do to ease a 3 week old|`|oXzHvsBpaa	No they can't use it. My son had the same problem at 2 months old. Our doctor said that there really isn't anything that you can do except suction it out, but talk to your doctor about it because they might be able to give him an antibiotic to help with the sinuses if it is a sinuses infection.|`|CofT1t1aaa	um look on webmd and put in the symptoms and see what they and see what they say    and Liam is a great name, i love the name Liam|`|hieQHR0daa	Take your son into the bathroom and run the shower. The steam will help his breathing. You can also create a sort of steam "tent" with an old sheet thrown over his crib and a dish of very hot water with some "vick" in it on the floor near the crib, under the "tent" but where it cannot be accidentally spilled onto him.  Tease a bit of cotton wool or a paper hankie corner and tickle the base of his nose with that until he sneezes.  You can massage the bridge of his nose with some cream (just to avoid unpleasant friction. In the old days folk used a little butter but a tiny amount of a light baby cream works just as well.)  You should never put anything in a child's nose as if they move suddenly, and many do, you could damage the septum (bit between the nostrils)    This will get easier for him but steam, from the shower or via a "tent" is kinder and more gentle for loosening things off.
cAtWxJG1aa	my personal desire is to have a partner both for my parenting and for my life.    i'm reasonably confident that's what most people want, though i understand that not all people are lucky enough to have it, and some people simply don't want it (and that's fine, too).    actually, i think most people want (and strive for) a happy nuclear family.  but they are less likely than they once were to settle for an unhappy nuclear family, and some are possibly less likely than they once were to try to make an unhappy family become happy.  we do seem to expect, in our internet society, for everything we want to happen instantaneously, and marriage tends not to be like that.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I think it has to an extent, people dont try to work on their marriages any more, too many get married knowing that at the first sign of trouble they can run, and too many of them do instead of even trying to work things  out. nobody is going to make it in  a marriage if they dont  put any effort into it|`|prqrQcd1aa	I am a single mother of 3, i've never been married and thankful that i haven't been yet..because it would have ended in divorce. I live with a very loving boyfriend that i've known for 18 years, he and i share a long history together but he is not the father of any of my children...  Do i wish things would have been different, yes..but i'm not going to sit here and worry about it because that will get me no where and i can't go back and change the past. I can only learn from my mistakes, as everyone else does.  I too believe that "family at any cost" is wrong, i've been a child in that situation before and it was not a good one, i'll just say that!|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	I`m old-fashioned enough to believe that marriage still matters.    Years ago, most people stayed married  - not particularly for the `sake of the kids` or even that they were still `in love` - but simply because it was tied to survival.  Of course most kids benefitted also from having a stable family.  Tho in many cases `love` faded into something more comfortable most couples still liked each other and worked together.  So what happened to change all this?  It was that women became more independent - and could (with varying degrees of success) build a life on their own. But again, in many cases, it was the kids who paid the price, and still do.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I think people don't make enough of an effort to keep their families intact.  Things go wrong in most marriages but people don't want to tolerate anymore.  When children are involved we should strive to make it work.  I see posts on here all the time about problems with step children and step parents.  So when you leave a less than perfect marriage you often are exchanging one set of problems for another.|`|SsfnitjXaa	How are people today suppose to know how to pick a mate and how to make a traditional family when most were raised by unwed/divorced mother's with dad only being a support payment.    Excuses of "I don't love him anymore", "I am not happy" are actually cover ups for the fact that the female was just using the man to get a baby.  Fact is she never knew what love is (thought getting a mans attention was love) and she never was happy.    Women have to learn how to pick a person to marry and mate with and not settle for the first man that pays her attention.      On the other hand men have to learn a little self control and how to keep their zipper up in the presents of other women once they are married.|`|rLFmDQezaa	I feel that people rush into things these days. They take everything for granted and just assume that they want to get married without being in love with the other person. They don't fall out of love... they sometimes just realize that they never did love each other. Sometimes that's not the case... people can be in love and then not in love anymore.     I feel that people should take their time in deciding whether to get married or not. I don't believe in divorce... as everyone that I know has been through 1 or more. The divorce rate is overwhelming because too many people just get married without ever really knowing the other person. I have a system that I will make any significant other of mine go through before we can ever get married or reproduce. Hense, I'm not married and don't have children... which is good, because a couple of years into a relationship can tell you a whole lot more than a couple of months.|`|giKCTfnfaa	to each his own.  i have 2 wonderful children with no father in sight.  that doesn't make me a bad parent.  my children are perfectly well adjusted. they both are honor roll students.  neither get in trouble.  they both are well mannered.  i can't say that of children i know who come from homes in which the parents are still together.  it's not like i went out and had 2 children thinking i was going to raise them on my own.  my ex happened to find a family who was more important than his own.|`|GnXfEdegaa	Yes, we live in a "throw away" society.  Not all, but more than a decade or 2 ago, surely and it's not getting any better.  The sad part is couples are in bad marriages and have brought kids into it.  It's not fair for the kids.  They didn't ask for the neglect or abuse.  A marriage should be stable 1st.

However, that's not the problem if your hair is dying out.  Check the ingredients Label.  If alcohol is one of the first 10 ingredients in your shampoo and conditioner, there is your problem.  It's more common for alcohol to be in a hairspray but our shampoo and conditioner?  No...    I switch off between "Dove" and "Paul Mitchell".  Sounds funny I know but you can buy the Paul Mitchell two pack for $20.00 some times (sales is the only way I will buy it) and the Dove is not too bad.  Target seems to be the best place for that.      Oddly the Dove is considered my every day shampoo and the Paul Mitchell my immune shocker shampoo.  No way I am paying that much just for Shampoo and conditioner all the time.|`|os36Q3P2aa	I find elvive is quite good for me and  i have thick hair (shoulder length) they do a few different ones in the elvive range.

mc6YtaRbaa	You shouldn't look at the test other then when the directions tell you to, most are 3 minutes after taking it until 10 minutes later. After that they can not be relied on. If you had a faint line, then it's a positive you're just not producing enough hCG yet to get a dark line. Also the previous post said to use the digital ones. Those are great because they are easy to read, however none of them are as sensitive as a non-digital test so since you are taking the test prior to your missed period you might not get an accurate result with a digital test.|`|xnhwmontaa	I took a dollar general test with my second and it showed positive right away...|`|1bnhwGACaa	you are pregnant congrats   yes i had the same with this test   my line showed up 3 hours later   and then i went and bought one from walmart for 4 dollars and i came up positive instantly|`|AA11661793	I used to dollar store tests this time around, and i did 4 of the dollar ones and then i bought the one that cost 4 dollars lol so a total of 5 tests, and the 4 dollar ones sound like yours and i am definately pregnant.

I took a pregnancy test once I got home from work and it showed up negative. A few hours later, my husband went into the bathroom and discovered it was positive. I didn't believe it so I took another test a few days later. It showed up positive immediately. Maybe you need to wait a little while before taking a third test.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	You shouldnt look at a test the following day.     If you saw a faint line, then it is a positive test. You just have low hormone levels. IF you were to get a digital test that says pregnant or not pregnant, it would state pregnant. Because there is a presence of the HCG hormome.     I only test with ones that say "pregnant" or not pregnant". Less guessing.

446edbddd6db88aacfc6cef13d8f3aebaa	My first son was head down till the last week then he turned into an Oblique position, i felt most of the kicks in my ribs down on my right hand side     when i went into labour at 40 weeks the doctor tried to turn him externally which hurt like hell because i was in established labour so i ended up with a c section
YrsiSjNVaa	Hey Lola,    I dnt get ewcm either, but i do get lotion cm, i found this info for a rough guide;     1.  Immediately following menstruation there is usually a dry vaginal sensation and there is little or no cervical fluid.     2.  After a few days of dryness, there is normally a cervical fluid that is best described as "sticky" or "pasty" but not wet. While this kind of cervical fluid is not conducive to sperm survival these days may be considered as "possibly fertile" if found before ovulation.     3.  Following these "sticky" days, most women generally notice a cervical fluid that is best described as "creamy". This fluid may be white, yellow or beige in color and has the look and feel of lotion or cream. At this point the vagina may feel wet and this indicates possible increased fertility.     4. The most fertile cervical fluid now follows. This most fertile fluid looks and feels like raw egg white. It is slippery and may be stretched several inches between your fingers. It is usually clear and may be very watery. The vagina feels wet and lubricated. These days are considered most fertile. This is the fluid that is the most friendly and receptive to sperm. It looks a lot like semen and, like semen, can act as a transport for sperm.     5.After ovulation, fertile fluid dries up very quickly and the vagina remains more or less dry until the next cycle. Some women may notice small amounts of fertile-looking fluid after ovulation as the corpus luteum produces small amounts of estrogen, but you are not at all fertile after ovulation has been confirmed.    Hope it helps, Loads of luck and tons of baby dust!! xxxxxxxxxxx|`|c1399de03ef647ddb85fb6f6fd6f6c2baa	If the CM is fairly runny lotiony like, then it sounds like you're on the run up to ovulation, if it's a bit clumpy or sticky, then you've either passed ovulation or not coming up to it just yet.    However, as you know, our bodies are weird and wonderful things [mine more weird at the moment lol] and they can trick you into thinking all sorts. Keep going with the OPK's [little tip - the internet cheapies are a whole lot cheaper than the Clearblue ones, and you get a load, so you could test all month if you wanted to, without breaking the bank]    As regards to the EWCM, just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it's not there, I read somewhere recently that it sometimes just doesn't work it's way down to be noticable in your underwear, or when you wipe, but there could still be plenty where it's needed.    Fingers crossed for your smiley face soon, :-)|`|z0XRuVwSaa	hu lola hun i used to get a creamy white lotion type cm just as i was about or to ovulate .  to help your partner sperm count tell him to take high dosages of zinc to improve it and make more sperm hun|`|igPBuDHkaa	hiya hun haven't been on in ages been so sick with sickness its awful   but when i noticed this it was when i was ovulating hope this helps hun     and hope everything works out for you and billy x x x|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	unfortunately lola, our bodies are confusing!!!!!!!!!

EWCM comes when you ovulate. Lotions wouldn't be stretchy or sticky. Good luck with the BD !
e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	hi lynne x i'm also a stay at home mum, and like you its a mutual agreement between us. we couldn't afford the childcare and to be honest i think he prefers that all his clothes are washed, ironed the house is clean, kids are happy, his dinners ready in the evening (always homemade, not junk) and the heatings on for him comin home (he works outside as an engineer building hms ships). i feel theres more bitchiness, pardon my french, from working mums! i've done my day of working, taking care of the family and i found it too stressful. like having all these balls in the air and trying to juggle them. something had to fall. my childcare was horrendous. now when i get a dig from a working mum, i retort with- i watch my kids learn something new everyday, the reason they do is because of ME. my hubby gets well looked after and i'm not stressed out. my day is very military run- i'm all about routine. routine is extremely hard to keep going when your out working, trying to keep a home running, racing here and there to collect kids from a childminder, making nutricious meals and having romantic time with hubby. i'll go back to work when my kids are up a bit! for now, i'll continue to stay at home, be a domestic goddess, lol and NOT feel guilty that i'm not 'OUT GRAFTING' i'm in grafting!!!!!!!!!!! i do just as much as my hubby- i just don't have a salary|`|1KIwM1uOaa	Just tell the person who made the comment that it is both your money that although you do not work outside of th home you save him a lot of money on a housekeeper, cook, taxi service, nanny, plumber etc.    I stay at home even though now all our kids are in school and it is still a full time job and there is always something to do.No one seems to understand that being a stay at home mom is more than sitting on the couch watching soaps and eating bonbons.  We do not get time of when we are sick, we do not get vacations or holidays off and our days goes from the time we get up until we fall into bed exhausted.|`|J3TRJPIwaa	I know my husband wouldn't be as concentrated on his work if he had to remember to pay the water bill and make sure there was enough in the bank to cover the mortgage. I deal with the finances in our house and if I didn't I think my husband would be a little more distracted.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	I think when you have children you become a team with your partner. if you have both decided that you not working and staying home with the kids is important then you have both made the decision that you and your husband have equally important jobs. my husband works which means he pays the bills, but him paying the mortgage doesn't make the house any less mine.... he doesn't cook, clean, do laundry take out garbage go grocery shopping etc. and me being the one taking care of the kids 24/7 doesn't make them anymore mine then his. everything we have is shared equally. when i worked it wasn't my money and his money it was always ours. why should it be any different now?|`|824cf20ac9afab200fa70ace25a4cc7daa	The answer is Permanent Press Clothing.  I do my own laundry, cook my own meals, and provide my own emotional support.      Plus the laundry places around here will wash and press clothing for a nominal fee if I need it to be done.      The main benefit of a stay-at-home mom is that the kids have a better chance at good mental-health.|`|VxrI9kDGaa	My husband is very good and works full time, he recognizes that the amount i do at home with our 11month old son is more than he does at work. He gets to have a teabreak i dont. When your married shouldnt it be 'our money'. And you both chose to have a child someones got to look after it!  But whoever suggested that is stupid, in our house if my husband kept all his money where would food shopping money come from, and extras etc.  I guess that person thinks that staying at home and looking after a child is somewhat second rate to a full time job. They obviously dont have a child!!!    Well done anyway, i know how hard it is to be a stay at home mum and i say well done to all you woman that do it and support your working hubbys!|`|4YIUxSlYaa	What he earns is ours.  We are a family and he earns for his family.    Mind you, if my husband had to live alone I don't think he'd ever have heating, electricity, water etc.. he would be buggered if he had to pay bills!!    And your right, paying for childcare is hardly worth it when you come out with nothing.|`|YsnY9LqIaa	My husband has dared to say this before, and comments like 'well when you're actually working and bringing some money in, THEN you can have a say what it's spent on!'.  Could kill him!  I think a lot of people are of the opinion though that husbands whose wives stay at home are heroes and so compassionate for working so hard to provide.  I'm grateful to my husband of course, but like you say - everything I do at home and with our daughter makes his life a hell of a lot easier, and allows him to concentrate on his work more.|`|B1CfeLu9aa	a marriage is a team,   if you think of life as a 'business', all members of a family need to do their bit in order to make it work,  - unpaid work/paid work, it's all the same as long as the family unit works well!  xx|`|hieQHR0daa	Marriage, or at least any good marriage, is a partnership. Couples decide early on who will work and who will keep house, child mind etc. When both partners are working here should be division of labor within the home and that should be arrived at by open discussion and agreement. No one person could successfully manage to work for a good income and a career and mind house and home. If men had to pay for the services that women at home provide it would cost a lot more than anyone could reasonably afford.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	well when i turned 18, i got a whopper of a claim for an injury when i was a child (25,000 to be exact)  i spent a lot on him, and i mean a lot. i bought a car outright, TVs all the stuff we needed for our son, Xbox, Wii, new phones, clothes, holiday etc etc.     i don't think he would dare say that the money he earns is HIS after everything i have done for him. i raise his son every day, and look after him too. Yes, he goes out to work, but i work 24/7. i have his dinner ready for him, wash his clothes, pick up after him, never ask him for anything unless i need it. HE has the easy life! a personal slave! lol!  unfortunately we SAHMs don't get paid!      SARAH D: do you work at home then? if you didn't have to go back to work, would you still think it was unecessary to spend time at home with your child?|`|JjXFj2EBaa	I'm self employed and single so I had to return to work when my son was only four months old.  I have a very demanding job and I often work from straight after the baby goes to bed until 2 am.  Our clothes are still clean and ironed, we both eat well, he goes to bed laughing each night and we enjoy our time together at the weekends.  I refuse to believe that the job of a stay at home mother is necessary and I believe it sets a bad example for children that it's ok to just not work and let someone else carry you through life|`|5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	I am also a SAHM and my hubby doesn't want me to work! when i got with him, he was well off so didn't need to work (he was still my bf at the time) but after a while business didn't go so well , so i worked 7 days a week and had 2 jobs and carried working up until i was 6 mnths preg, but thank god things got better for him now!|`|QCVzUC1baa	I think if you can afford to stay at home as a mum great. As everyone has said its family money and should be spent on everyone in the family.  I have a son who turned 4 months this week and Im going back to work in 6 weeks. Believe me its the last thing I want to do but have no choice we need my salary to survive.    I agree with Vertigo when kids do start school i think the mums should go back to work.     I also think SAHM should think themselves lucky that they have the option to stay at home. Believe me I know its hard work but I think Im going to find it harder when I go back work, it will be like taking on another job!!|`|jrVlzffeaa	This drives me nuts!! Whenever we bicker my fiance ALWAYS throws it back in my face that he pays for EVERYTHING (except I pay for tesco shops when I get money) and it does my bloody head in!! Just coz he goes out to work and gets paid for it all of a sudden his job is harder than mine!! He always makes a point of throwing it back in my face, so recently I say to him to look after our son and do all th housework and I'll go out to work...result: Peace and quiet and an apologetic look from my fiance!! lol. We may have the best job in the world but we don't get paid for it!! lol Xx|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Me and my partner have different attitudes towards money.  He spends and doesn't worry, I save like crazy and appreciate the value of money.  Now he has a good job (has always earned more than me) so like yesterday he came home from work, a quick kiss and hello to me & Keira) then he was back out the door to a football match and said "you're alright aren't ya, I WORK ALL DAY YOU KNOW!!"  I don't moan at him, ever. I know he works hard so that we can live in a nice house but he doesn't see that sahm work hard too.  This is looking like a bit of a rant.  Here's the point.  I take care of the money, pay the bills every month, make sure all post is dealt with, even his mail because he can't be bothered to open it and would have got 1 or 2 fines from DVLA if it wasn't for me.  I organise how much spending money he can have because  if he had too much in his hand he would blow it.  So he puts me in charge and it works for us.  I'm not being big headed but if he had to sort out his own finances then no doubt the house would be up for sale by now and he'd have debts (it happened before but I sorted it out)|`|VEEbzc4jaa	mmmm.....tricky one really. Me and my hubs are in the marriage 50/50, all the way in everything we do but i have other married couples that who dont share and what theres is theres and that it.    Maybe hes holding a grudge coz ur a stay at home mum and hes out grafting? The pressure of the crunch??? More pressure on the man. I wouldnt personally want to be a stay at home mum and my hubs work hard for his family, i would want to help with money, however much he earns, but thats me??     Discuss this with him. xxxx|`|PSaXvIyWaa	I've been a stay at home mom for several years now and I can tell you that it is our money. Yes my husband earns the money/paycheck outside of the home but I earn the money inside the home. If I were working and earning "my own" money then he or my kids would not enjoy 3 home cooked meals everyday, clean clothes all the time, and the constant catering to their needs that I do. It's funny because the other day my 2 yr old said "Daddy goes to work" then I said "Oh ok well what does mommy do?" and his reply was " You take care of us" It was sweet and made my job all worthwhile. If I worked and my husband stayed home then it would still be our money. Once you get married and have kids any money made is Family money|`|x0bJmyDPaa	I'm a single mother - I did the stay at home bit when my kids were little (and I was still married to their father), and I have to say it's the hardest job in the world.  I just think it's important for pre-schoolers to have mum (preferably) at home with them - it gives them a sense of security.  However, I think that once kids get to school age, there's no reason for the mother not to get a job to help with the finances - the financial burden shouldn't fall solely on the shoulders of the father.
giKCTfnfaa	5th disease starts out like a cold...mild fever, stuffy nose, etc. you think it's gone, then you get a rash on your face that starts out like blotches and spreads.  when my son got it at daycare, the rash stayed on his face, but it can spread all over the body.      i had to look this part up...  if a mother contacts 5th disease during pregnancy, especially during the first half of her pregnancy, the unborn child could get anemia so bad it doesn't survive. however, most adults are immuned to 5th disease because of previous exposure to the virus.  less than 5% of pregnant women who become infected have any sort of serious problem.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	It doesn't sound like Fifth's to me. In children, it presents mostly as a lacey looking rash on the cheeks and other parts of the body. In adults, you get the rash and many times extreme body aches. Occasionally there is a fever as well. I'm a teacher, and when I was pregnant with my daughter there was an epidemic of fifth's at my school. I had to go see a specialist, and he advised me to take a leave of absence, which I did. Fifth's can be dangerous to the fetus, especially in the first trimester. By the third trimester, the risk is less, but still there. The main concern is miscarriage. I would definitely go get your blood checked to see if you've been exposed to it, because if you do have it, they'll want to monitor you and the baby much more frequently. Also, if you've had fifth's before, you can't get it again. That's usually something they check for at your initial appt, so they should know if you've had it in the past or not. Again, it doesn't sound like it to me (it usually doesn't involve the throat at all) but I would get checked just to be sure. Best of luck!
0nIwKd5Uaa	Sadly it could take weeks for it to come all the way through or just days. Give her a Popsicle or other cold things that she can eat to help her gums. When she goes to bed you can put some baby teething gel on her gums to help sooth it so she can sleep better.|`|jcXSNjowaa	once the tooth shows.. it doesnt hurt anymore, the hole is made..  maybe she has the second tooth coming too!|`|LMUwz5y8aa	Just twist it.    Your second option might be giving your babe a knife.|`|pYyIkljBaa	once its popped your in the clear. but it takes sometimes a few weeks to a month for it to completely come up.
kprKXEOSaa	Well, first off, you're a different age each time.  I'm 36 this time, and this pregnancy is harder than my first when I was 30.    Second, your behaviors and lifestyle before each pregnancy can be different.  For example, your weight before each pregnancy, if you were dieting to lose weight, if you had just lost or gained a bunch of weight.  Your overall fitness level and how much you were exercising.  Your diet, if you were in the habit of eating a bunch of junk and fast food or if you had been eating healthy balanced meals and snacks.  If you were dehydrated.  How long ago was your last baby born.  It's basically the state of your body just before getting pregnant, which can affect your whole pregnancy.    Also, I noticed a big difference between carrying a boy versus a girl.  For example, many women carrying boys tend to be hungrier and so they might gain more weight, that is partly because of the testosterone a baby boy excretes, and boy babies tend to be larger at birth than girls for this reason.  I hardly had any morning sickness with my boy, but with my girls I was much more sick.  My midwife said that she sees her patients in general more sick while carrying a girl, she thinks it's because of the estrogen a baby girl excretes.    There are also some conditions that might affect you one pregnancy, but not the next, and the reason may not be understood.  For example, I had toxemia with my last pregnancy, but not with the first.  I'm really hoping I won't get it this time, there is just no way to know, especially since they don't really know what causes it in the first place.    So, there are a complex set of variables which all add up to--every pregnancy is different.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	Your body change every year, you hormones change every second. And you expecting a whole new person every time you are pregnant. The combinations of the new baby (DNA) in all new to every pregnancy.   I think it is to big for us to understand how special it really is. One day we will have an idea.|`|zHYro8rnaa	It is the level of hormones in your system. With every pregnancy it is different so therefore you get different side affects from the hormones.|`|EjoLgMdKaa	All are different because all of us are different.Simply,its like comparing you and your family to the people down the road.Basically we are made from the same stuff,but reality is we come from a long line of our own families that have different genes than us .You take that and combine it with a whole other family of traits (the dads)and chromosome's  who  knows what your going to get.Its crazy!!Not only are all pregnancies different but then so are the babies,the way they develop and grow and learn.Its one of the most amazing things ever.Congrats mom!!
SLy9xFwkaa	this is normal for alot of women who are on birth control (spotting between periods) as far as the pains i can not tell you. you need to make an appointment with your own OBGYN soon if you think this may be a real problem.      Dr. Adam B.  M.D. OBGYN|`|cSOpcKOWaa	Mid cycle pains are usually associated with ovulation, however bleeding isn't usually simultaneous with this, I would go see my doctor. I had the loop done as well and I never experienced this.|`|ESczcxlMaa	okay first off your parter obviosly has a huge dong dude lol you need to call me up mine is smaller lol|`|iyb7YGXHaa	well you don't need me to tell you what bleeding  between your periods and cramps can mean.  (JADE GOODY) go to the doc asap
ZejwYamhaa	A doctor should never treat or make you feel like a 'stupid lady'. She should be professional at all times and have no attitude. If you are having problems with your doctor then change your doctor, there are plenty of doctors.|`|UOrZ4or4aa	Is she your real doctor?  If not go to your real one  Or ask to change doctor or try a different surgery.|`|xXfVeaFWaa	1 week before your cycle?  There is a small chance you might be pg, but a chance nonetheless.    If you are pg, give the child up for adoption.  That way, a needy family could raise the child and you won't have to carry the guilt of aborting a baby.|`|tcU1Xnftaa	Its too soon to worry, but you definitely need a more professional doctor.
zHYro8rnaa	She doesn't have to nap at all some children just do not want to sleep during the day at all. There is a technique called controlled comforting that I used with my youngest and I liked this idea a lot better than leaving her to cry herself to sleep.     -What I did was put bub in bed play her music mobile.  -Say" Goodnight, I love you"  - Walk out of the room.  - When she started crying I would go in and do what ever it took to settle her (patting, rocking, singing,etc) last resort was to get her out of the cot.  - Once she had settled I would go out of the room again.  I kept doing this until she settle and finally went to sleep. It took probably 5 days of this and she then would put her self to sleep babble and talk for awhile but never cry or scream (unless something was wrong dirty nappy or something)    You could also try putting her down for 1 day sleep and try early afternoon so she has been up for the morning and then a bit of the afternoon so she should be tired by then.    Hope that helps!! Good Luck!|`|S4dLfbHAaa	My son didn't nap in his cot until he was about 11 months, because thats how long it took for him to develop a regular napping pattern and we only wanted to associate his cot with sleeping. When he was small enough and tired we put him in either his bouncy chair or car seat nad kept in whatever room we were in, and often bounced/rocked him until he dropped off.  He also had a dummy when we wanted him to get to sleep, and the motion seemed to help him drop off, and of course we were right there so he was happy. When he got a bit bigger, we put him in his buggy for naps when he was tired (different times each day), and if it took a while for him to settle we pushed the buggy back and forwards for a bit then left him in the hallway where it was a bit quieter, and eventually he settled into a set time for naps, at which point he settled fine in his cot.|`|YFaOg5izaa	Please Ignore THE SNAKE, he or she are impotent also know as barren.     I have a two year old.  He would cry for everything, when I picked him up it was pleasure for him.  I learnt to put him in a bouncer, one that sways side to side or rocks front to back. He would stay in this for a few hours, in front of the TV. If it was getting too much, I would take him out for a walk, the same time every day.  As soon as he falls as sleep I would head back home and leave him in the pram until he wakes. This would give me ample amount of time to do the things I need to do.   Picking the child up all the time is not good, we are paying the consequences now  and he is two years!|`|deIzFnV8aa	It really makes a huge and enormous difference if you can catch them looking tired (yawning, rubbing eyes, staring) and get them to bed soon after.  If I catch our DD at the right time, it takes 5 minutes to get her sung to and to sleep; if I miss the signals, its a half hour battle  of tired crying.|`|LMUwz5y8aa	WOW!! Your baby only has sex 9 or 10 hours a night?!?! What a C*OCKED up loser!!|`|c73QkZ2haa	If she is sleeping thru the night and shes not showing signs of being unreasonably tired during the day i dont see why she needs to nap. If she is tired she will nap but you cannot force her to fall asleep. Maybe if it is time for a nap and shes not tired than make it "resting" time and go lie with her and read some stories. She wont get sleep but shell get a rest.   She doesnt really need a nap if she is not tired and leaving her there isnt gonna make her very happy.  ETA: Having a Health visitor is great i have one too but not all things work for all people. They also told me i cant let baby sleep on the couch when im sitting right beside him/her. So.|`|FlxcDU9daa	Do not panic.... baby's go through different stages. Yes babies do need to nap, for various reasons, however she will do it when she needs too, and it might be what is just normal for her. My son would sleep on and off all day my daughter, literally napped 1/2 hour a day! I'd recommend that if she's not fallen asleep with half and hour, bring back downstairs with you, run through a check list, i.e nappy, wind etc. And try again when things are calmer. There is no harm in her laying on a mat or in a bouncy chair and watching eat or just talking, she'll soon give off tired vibes. If like me you run out of things to say, i used to read magazine articles to them! I got a break and they were lulled by the sound of my voice.     Remember everyone is different and has different needs.|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	if she is sleeping a lot through the night maybe she is not sleepy. but you should rock her or sway he side to side. She still is little and she doesn't know how to put herself to sleep not all babies can, I have a 5 month old and I always sway him side to side to sleep or if not in his bouncer and I don't mind........if he is tired and wants to nap I will do whatever I can to get him to sleep, plus I only rock him for about  min and he is out. Don't listen to what other people say......|`|cSOpcKOWaa	let her cry and don't pick her up all of the time, let her cry for probably 10-15 minutes, and if she doesn't stop go in and say mommy loves you and I will be in the next room. shut the door and walk out. Maybe you could play some story books on CD so that she has something to listen to.
igPBuDHkaa	when i went for a scan cause i was cramping the doctor said its normal if there is any bleeding i would start to worry but if not you will be fine am 9 weeks and i still get pains     good luck and congrats x x|`|zSABr7praa	I get mild cramps(more like uncomfortable sensations) from time to time, but never any bleeding, my doctor said it's normal-as long as there's no bleeding!  Best of luck|`|mc6YtaRbaa	The cramping is your uterus stretching. It will happen starting around 4-5 weeks and will end in a few weeks from now. It kind of feel like period cramps but it's just the uterus stretching.|`|yvQpQjv1aa	early on in my pregnancy i had a fair bit of period like cramping with no bleeding. i have also had 2 friends who during pregnancy went to hospital due to severe cramps which actually turned out to be wind. (but they were further along) i wish i had more answers for you, can you see a doctor sooner than the 12th?  good luck with it all,i hope it turns out ok.
giKCTfnfaa	it can be done.  it's done through an amniocentesis in the second trimester. i'm not sure if this test would stand up in a court or the accuracy.  i'd personally wait until the baby is born because there can be side effects to the test (i.e. miscarriage).|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	They can do a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amnio, but that has a chance of miscarriage, which isn't really worth it. Otherwise you'll have to wait until the baby is born.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	You cannot do it. They would need to swab the baby to compare DNA and they can't. You have to wait until you deliver.|`|79eRDIbXaa	No it can not be done while pregnant. It has to be done when the baby is born.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Yes it can be done!! With an amniocentesis test. It is 100% accurate but it is risky. An amnio. test is done by inserting a needle into the uterus through the abdomen and taken a sample of amniotic fluid. This is done to detect birth defect, like Down Syndrome, maturity of a baby's lungs, uterine infection and several other complications. It can also tell you 100% the gender of the baby and DNA. The amniotic fluid contains fetal cells. The procedure does carry a risk of miscarriage and infection. So most women elect to do DNA testing after the baby is born. I have no idea how much your Dr or hospital would charge though. I personally don't know anyone that had one done.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Yes it can be done 2 different ways  Amniocentesis or Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). However both are risky to a pregnancy and are usually only done if there is a problem. I would just tell her its better to wait until her baby is born to avoid any harm. Good luck
CkecSp4Uaa	All things in moderation!  A little liver is fine, but I wouldn't eat more than one serving per week (actually, as liver is the only food that will make me gag just thinking about it I personally wouldn't eat liver period).  Liver is high in both vitamin A and iron, so both bits of info are right.  However, the liver is also the filter of the body, EVERYTHING goes through the liver and gets filtered while the animal is alive.  It's kind of like eating bottom-feeding fish...a little won't hurt you but it can add up and they never really totally eliminate all traces of toxins that they come into contact with.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If you're going to eat liver, do it in extreme moderation. It apparently has high amounts of the retinol form of Vitamin A, which can have negative effects on the baby. I would stay away from other organ meats in general just because of threat of contamination, depending on the animal (cow especially).     http://www.babycentre.co.uk/pregnancy/nu...|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	im having baby 6 and this is 1 rule that has never changed NO liver at all   thank goodness i dont like it :P  steak is great for increasing your haemoglobin if that helps|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I was told to not eat ANY organ meat, especially liver. It acts as a detox filter in the animals body and contains toxins that can be dangerous to a baby.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Definitely no liver or other organ meat according to my doctor and my mother who loves liver and couldnt eat it during any of her pregnancies lol|`|ZYouNFQbaa	I have 2 children and it has always be do not eat liver, my friends mum is a midwife and she agrees.|`|P25GuvNjaa	I have never heard to eat liver in pregnancy, everything I have ever heard or read tells you to stay away from it, so to be on the safe side i would do just that!|`|jzdhqxPTaa	No liver!! I didn't know this, and I had a small portion, I was 8weeks. I believe everything is fine though.  Fish is a biggy too. Small fish is ok twice a week, but others have tons of mercury and is very harmful to the baby.  Trust your doctors and health practitioners. Don't read too much on internet, if your unsure, go to the goverments health/preg website, like the NHS for example. Good luck and congrats. x
oXzHvsBpaa	It could be a pulled muscle. You might have done something so small that you would never have thought to pull a muscle. You could try taking some Tylenol, a back support, or a nice warm bath. I usually just had my husband give me a back rub that worked the most. Then after wards I took a warm bath.|`|yRihCgxaaa	IM 35weeks and have the exact same problem, maybe your getting around to much and need to elevate your feet and also get a heat pack and put it on the sore area.    Also it is a prefect excuse to get a massage.
xue72D76aa	Unfortunately, the only way to know for sure would be to get a pregnancy test.  Those symptoms might be pregnancy...they might not be.  Every pregnancy is different and everyone's symptoms can be different.  Some people get morning sickness, others never feel sick at all during the pregnancy.  Some people complain of their breasts hurting, others never feel this.  Some people have implanation bleeding, others don't.  You get the idea :)  If you are really strapped for cash, you can check out clinics in your area and there are likely to be a few that do free pregnancy testing.  Good luck!|`|yOyg3gnJaa	It's always possible to be pregnant when you have unprotected sex.  Having your period the end of December, normally it is around 15 days after that when you ovulate, which would be around January 13th or so... so you had sex over a week after that- some woman do ovulate before or after that 15 days, I myself am about 10 days, not 15.  The only thing for sure that you can do is to take a test.  Sometimes women, especially with you being so young and still growing a bit, can have periods that are a little "off", being light, or very short.  If you've had a lot of stress, or dieting, or exercising increase lately, that could always be the cause for the light period.  Just take a test and put your worries at rest, and...  Good Luck!|`|zSABr7praa	The only symptom you NEED to have to take an HPT is if your period is late.  Especially sense your period was irregular the month before and you had unprotected sex.  If you don't want to waste your money on HPTS, then invest in some condoms, or planned parenthood can get you on birth control for free.|`|yRihCgxaaa	Im 16 and pregnant now,    Some of the things your saying can be symptoms, but you should really go to the doc and get a blood test, it is free, and 99.999999  percent accurate rather than getting a home kit because they can f up and stuff so yeah don't be worried just get checked out asap.|`|Lck9Fg04aa	ok implantation bleeding is light spotting which some woman get when the egg attaches itself to the uterus, this happens +- 8 days after conception has taken place!  if you have not had another period since the spotting i would suggest getting a test    you cant feel thre baby move till  about 18-20 weeks into your pregnancy, so the movement you feeling is not a baby moving.    put your mind at ease and get a test it will be accurate by now!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	yes it sounds possible definately take a test and definately STOP taking laxatives if you are infact stop now incase!|`|eVK2zZsOaa	You might be pregnant but the only way to know for sure would be to go to the doctor or get a test. If you are having unprotected sex, there is a chance that you could be pregnant. If your monthly doesn't come  this month it is safe to say that you might be pregnant. If you aren't pregnant, it would be a good idea to start making him wear protection or get you some birth control pills. Not trying to lecture but I was a young mom and it is not easy. Trying to go to college and raise a baby was a very difficult thing to do for me and the father.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	take a test its the only way u will no|`|b6LcC0CEaa	I had a very light weird period that only lasted 3 days or so when I was due for my period, so I took the test and I was positive. (I had the implantation bleeding). Find a coupon and go buy the test just in case.. GL
pzLDXL6gaa	I think the spotting and late period is caused by missing the pill. As you took it as soon as you remembered and had protected sex I doubt you're pregnant. But it's possible, you'd have to take a test to show for sure. Might be too early for test results so maybe take one in a week if no period.    Harriet|`|zSABr7praa	Even if you take your pills everyday, it's not certain that you won't get pregnant.  I know plenty of people who've had surprise pregnancies while on the pill.  Missing a pill makes the pill less effective, regardless of wether or not you double up the next day.  It could also mess with your period!  Take a test in a week if you're still worried.|`|yRihCgxaaa	To get a proper answer i would see you doctor that is the only way you will know, and get some advice with missing pills and what to do.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	Well if you are having unprotected sex and not taking your pill like you should, you could be pregnant. The only way to find out would be to go the doctor or get a test.|`|Lck9Fg04aa	hmmm, missing your pills and then taking double to catch up could mess up with your cycle.  the only thing you can do is take a test and find out- its better than worrying- it will be accurate now..    i know though that even missing one pill then having unprotected sex can cause you to fall pregnant- so anything is possible
xue72D76aa	It is very likely that you are pregnant if you had unprotected sex while ovulating.  That's the whole purpose of ovulation - to release an egg for fertilization.|`|zSABr7praa	Pregnancy test is the only way to know, there's nothing we can tell you that could ease your mind on the question.  Yes, those are symptoms, but they're also symptoms of PMS, only a test will tell.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	There is a really good chance you are. You had sex at the right time. When I first thought there was a possibility of me being pregnant I had a really sore back and really sore boobs. I did not get super hungry or tired until about 6 weeks. The only question I have is why did you have unprotected sex while you were ovulating if now you are worried about being pregnant? You have to know that unprotected sex leads to pregnancy, so you really should not be worried just accept the fact that you had sex at your most fertile time of the month.|`|yRihCgxaaa	Girlie get your bum to the doc and get a blood test.    Because im pregnant now and i have done the exact same thing as you.    XX|`|eVK2zZsOaa	You might be pregnant but you might want to go to the doctor or take a pregnancy test to be sure. Those are some symptoms but that means nothing. Get a test immediately, the sooner you find out the better so that you can begin your doctor's visits and prenatal vitamins.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	While those are symptoms of pregnancy, they're also symptoms of stress.  The only way you'll know is to get a pregnancy test.  You can buy them at the cheap Dollar Stores, from $1 on up.  Usually, around 5-8 dollars.    I hope it gives you the answer you want.|`|Lck9Fg04aa	well you cant know for sure untill you miss your period and take a test.    but yes i would think you have a pretty good chance of being pregnant hun.    dont be scared- take it one step at a time|`|0ZLgCzk8aa	I would take a test The symptoms sound right!|`|yH4y44Q6aa	You're stressing out about it. And when you stress out you're body does weird things. When you are pregnant you don't always have all these symptoms that quickly. Especially food cravings. Wait til you've missed at least 2 periods before you worry. Are you on the pill? Maybe you should have taken the morning after pill.
AA12069058	All you can do is tell her to get pop up blocker and try to avoid it next time. Theres nothing she can do, the damage is done. Good Luck ?
45ae879c8612dab66b55d809753dd2d1aa	Mine did the same...    He is 27 now and still wakes up....  Though we have trained him not to come into our bed any more!!!      Sorry to leg pull here but I know how hard wakefulness was for us.      My best route was to ask advice from my health visitor/clinic. I was lucky with her and her advice worked.    Our decision to tackle the night time wakefulness happened when he was around 18months to 2yrs old.  That was the best timing for us.  We had a healthy child.     I would question if a 'meal' in the form of a bottle is still relevant for him.  I can't remember the routine of babies at that age now, but maybe by replacing plain water (to protect his teeth) of a night will teach his digestive system not to be hungry in the night and break the cycle of demand feeding too.  Please determine if night feeding is still needed for your child.    Does he eat sufficiently at his last meal of the day?  Is he a thirsty creature?  Is he too hot or too cold. Is his room quiet or is there disturbance nearby?     It was down to a very regular evening routine, starting at teatime, and not being instantly available when he cried. We stayed close by his room to ensure his safety, and stayed quiet.    No raised voices, no anger, quiet patient persistence...    Totally accepting that nothing works immediately.    We started on a night when there would be no demands on us over the next few nights.    We decided  to put aside a convenient period to dedicate our night time to training him to fall asleep without us there.  Gently but determined to extend the minutes before we came to attend him.  We did shifts to be alert for him.     We did not talk to him or put lights on when he was supposed to be sleeping.  Thus teaching him the difference between activity at night and day.     The heaviest dedication happened from a Thursday to a Monday night.  It was the worst part.     By the end of the first week there was a significant difference.    At the end of a fortnight, he was just so much better.    At the end of a month, he was just a different child.    It takes TWO parents to support each other in this, and in the exact same focus.  No Slip-ups or going back.     You will be helping him and ensuring happy awake parents in the day.    Good luck.    P.S.  You have to do what is right for you. You will have lots of advice, so take the bits you like to form your own course of action, and forget the rest.  You are the one who knows your child best, and you know your own temperament too.  Anger and irritation have no place in the training of a baby/toddler.  So keep a keen check on yourself to ensure a lovely loving balance with your little one.|`|SsfnitjXaa	He has not learned how to amuse himself until he falls asleep again.  Check on him but do not allow him to see you.    If he continues to cry go in and pat him on the back and put on some wind up music and go quickly leave.  Do not feed him.     If he continues to cry, change his diaper quickly in bed and leave again.|`|WaYZQhnHaa	I had this problem with one of my sons.  One night, instead of giving a bottle of milk, I offered water.  Of course he didn't want that and cried, but eventually fell back asleep.  When he woke again, I did the same thing.  It wasn't easy, and it took a few nights of this, but within a week he stopped waking for the bottle of milk.    I feel your frustration...good luck to you!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well stop with teh bottle and persevere he has it once he will expect it again:) try to resettle him as best you can and persevere in his room, lights low or off, calming voice not loud, dont be chatty make sure he knows its sleep time. he will settle eventually, as the days go on youll find hes up less or shorter periods. you could also let him cry it out but i found with my daughter it made him worse and more unsettled. also, he may be teething so give him something to calm that incase, maybe if hes taking abottle in the night hes hungry? so try feeding him more in the day or give him some fruit for a bedtime snack:)|`|AA11111862	First I say "GOOD LUCK". I was so happy to see this question because i am going thru it now. My son is 15 months & he wakes 3 times in the middle of the night hungry. Letting him cry makes him worse. He is hungry & not fully awake. Making him cry just makes him fully awake & then i have to stay up awhile to put him back to sleep. I give the bottle also. What can i do??? Put him in the high chair & feed him a meal? Out of  the question. I feed him a snack before bed, give him a bath, etc. I  have done it all. My doctor said that he maybe going thru a growth spurt and is requiring more food. He told me that , like all things, this is a stage & it will pass eventually. I was told to try a heavier snack before bed. I am passing on what i was told by my doctor. Its not working for me, but i hope it really works for you.|`|bvYPr0Cvaa	Don't worry my 13 month old daughter is the same way. Have you tried putting some of his favorite toys in the crib with him, this way when he wakes up he has something to entertain him until he gets sleepy and falls back to sleep. I also give my daughter a bottle of milk or juice to keep in the crib with her, so that i don't have to get up 2 or 3 times a night to make her one, usually only have to get up once to refill it. Best of luck!!!!|`|wa3wylEuaa	try a soothing bath before you put him down at night, maybe try keeping him up alittle later at night and holding off the last bottle till just before bedtime. soothing music till he drifts off, maybe a story something along those lines. thats the best you can do some babies are just restless and dont want to miss anything around them so if theres alot of noise were hes sleeping its not going to help. best of luck|`|e12yd9gYaa	Id be careful with the juice in the bottle laying in the crib all night. The sugars from the juice can mess their teeth up and the milk will go bad real quick. Im going thru this too. HATE IT. My daughter wakes up about 4 times a night wanting a bottle. Im just gonna stop giving it. Its gotten to the point where she just expects it. So Im just gonna start putting a cup of water in her bed and obviously, a toddler doesnt want to drink a lot of water so eventually it will stop. May be a few longg nights but you have to think the way that they do. I was told that to get them to stop wanting a bottle during the night, to dilute the milk an oz a night such as.. dilute it one oz one night, two oz the next. It starts to taste gross and they will think they all taste that way. Of course, theyll scream for a few nights but you have to just deal with it and keep some alcohol next to the bed to get yourself thru it LOL. just playing. But seriously... maybe those suggestions will help someone. Good luck everyone! Were all on the toddler sleepless night wagon together!!|`|m40CSYgGaa	My first child did the same thing. But once I took her bottle away she started sleeping without any problems. The best way to take a bottle is to go by the almanac, take the bottle when the signs are in the feet this usually last a couple of days by the time the signs are in the head your baby should forget about the bottle and start sleeping through the night. I have two children and this worked for me it also worked for my best friends mother who had 10 children, she was the one who told me.   Hope this helps.
xue72D76aa	Spotting would not indicate that "her egg was ready".  The way the body works is you have a 28 day cycle (usually, this can vary per woman).  You have a period for the first 5-7 days, ovulate (release an egg) around the 14th day.  Around the time of ovulation is when a woman is most fertile; if she has unprotected sex during this time she is more likely to conceive.  If the egg was not fertilized, she has a period 2 weeks after ovulation.  If she has not had a period in 3 months, there can be several reasons.  A) pregnancy, B) stress, C) she's become too thin or too athletic and has stopped having periods, D) something is medically wrong.  She should see a doctor to determine the cause.  Good luck.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	have her to go on the pill, it will regulate her period and keep her from getting pregnant too.  there is no way to know if she is preg except for to wait and let her take the test at this point...the spotting could have also been implantation bleeding, which means she conceived. it could have been anything since she is so irregular though.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	is she pregnant>?? you should be more concerned as to why she has not had her period .|`|jcXSNjowaa	sounds like shes pregnant.
Q3x0yfmtaa	I threw up from 4am until 11pm every day through my first and most of my second trimester. I lost some weight, and was given THREE different prescriptions to try to calm it down because I was getting dehydrated and I was in and out of the ER. Talk to your doctor, they might give you phenagran or zofran or suggest something. I tried EVERYTHING from morning sickness teas, lollipops, ginger pills...And I the only thing that helped was one of the prescriptions, the Zofran. It's extremely expensive though, and a lot of insurance companies don't pay for it, or not a lot of it. It helped some, but it wasn't a cure.    Since you've been pregnant before, I'm sure you know you'll find foods that rarely make you sick or that you can keep down. Just eat those, variety is not an option when you're throwing everything up. Just eat and drink whatever you can. If all you can hold down is a cheeseburger from McDonalds and a coke, by all means, eat it. As for the weak feeling, that didn't go away until the sickness went away, which mine too a long time, but finally did somewhere in the middle of my second trimester.|`|Lck9Fg04aa	yup the joys  of pregnancy.    i was so bad at one stage i ccould not even make it through a day at work i would go and lie on the floor somewhere just for a few minutes rest, i felt aweful.  i couldn hold any food down, i was so nauseas it felt like i had been drinking and i was suffering from a hangover all day-(but a real bad one)    just keep drinking water! to keep yourself hydrated, i sucked on ice, which kinda helped. i also got nausea tablets perscribed,     different things work better for different woman so try: sucking lemons, having ginger, eating small meals, eating dry toast and tea (to bind the stomach), dry crackers and cheese,     good luck- it will pass soon though :-)|`|RncUc0traa	i was the same way i couldnt eat anyting i read online tip and they say crackers and gingerale but as soon as it go down it came back up. i was so hungry my doc told me i must try eat still even suck a chocolate. but during my pregnancy i couldnt smell or even tink about food until i was 8 mth i kno its hard but my b/f toook ova the cooking or he was so nice to go out for dinner. because throwing up use to make hold body shake a dont kno if  ur vomiting is no bad..but what really help a little wen i felt i wanted to throw up i gaurgle salt water.     but good luck!! and dont worry about ur baby he/she is taking enough food to live on so u r not throwin up all my baby girl born 8 lbs.|`|zgDQrI2uaa	Yes I've had "all day and night sickness."  I was so pissed off that it was called "morning sickness"  because the idiot who coined that term HAD to be a man.  I lost 25lbs and went down to 80lbs because I threw up everything and couldn't stand any odor whatsoever.  My stomach was so sore I couldn't move.    My SIL also had this and we both ended up on an IV during our pregnancies just to keep us hydrated.  That was 22 years ago.  Because of this lovely experience I just had the one kid; there was no way I was going through all that again.      Make sure your doctor knows what is going on.  I understand that now days they can give you something for the nausea.  Bless your heart.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	I had this from about 6 weeks til 21 weeks... your dr can definitely prescribe something for you to take to help ease it a little. Good luck.. I know exactly how you feel : /|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Oh yes and I hate it.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	My roommate was that bad until she was about 5 months along. She had to quit her job and even quit her extra babysitting side job, and could hardly look after her daughter. She was sick all day and all night... It was pretty awful...    Sorry to hear you're feeling so icky, hope you feel better soon!!|`|Srad4VUxaa	Every pregnancy is different. How many weeks are you and am wondering if you aren't carrying multiples. Sometimes N&V is more severe with multiples.  If you are feeling that bad, you should make an appt. with your OB to see if they can give you an antiemetic.  Of course the main concern is dehydration.  If you don't feel like eating until night time, then that's when you should try to get in those calories to keep your energy up.  I used to get sick all the time with my first baby for about 20 weeks.  It is more difficult when you have younger children to look after AND feeling sick.  I hope you start feeling better soon.|`|QXlvr4zBaa	The same thing happened to me until I stopped taking the prenatal vitamins. I now take 2 Flinstones and a folic acid. My Dr said its fine as long as I have the folic acid. As soon as I made the switch I was fine.|`|jcXSNjowaa	yup my first pregnancy from 6- 18 weeks morning till night..    with multiple trips to the hospital    the doctor can prescribe you a anti nausea medication for pregnant woman, it even has a picture of a pregnant woman on the pill :P its called diclectin, it could be pricey but well worth it!|`|EraBTmV5aa	oh yes! i had it that bad from about week  8 to week 16...  my doctor prescribed Diclactin  and it did help quite a bit!!  i couldnt even keep water down, it was pretty brutal but def. the medicine helped it didnt completely cure it, but it helped i was able to keep down liquids, soups, bread, crackers .. just light things.|`|xEeWvntGaa	I had three children less than two years apart each and had severe morning sickness with all three and the last one Gestational Diabetes.  I can only tell you, hang in there!  Eat whatever you can keep down.  I found it so hard to cook for my family, with the smells and all, my husband took over the evening cooking and lunch was just something I had to tough through. I remember laying on the couch and watching my kids play on the floor in front of me, all the while I am thinking, "Can I do this?"  I'm here to tell you, YES, you can!!!!  I found PowerAid to be very helpful, bagels and an occasional cheeseburger (which my kids didn't mind eating one every other day either!)  Hang in there!|`|Hhifw93laa	yeah this happened to me with my first i threw up all day long i asked why it was called morning sickness its all day sickness but they put me on a med called compozine ask your doc to make sure your baby is getting enough nutrition|`|yOyg3gnJaa	I had it this bad with my first child, up until I was in labor unfortunately.  They were contemplating putting me in the hospital for awhile because of the risk of having hyperemesis, but I ended up gaining around 15 lbs. through out the pregnancy so they said as long as I didn't lose that weight and could keep some supplements down I would be okay.  I hope it gets better for you soon, I know how terrible it can be.  Good Luck and Congratulations again, mommy!|`|rLFmDQezaa	This happened to my friend during her second pregnancy... this one was a boy. She even said she knew it was a boy because the first time she didn't go through it.    Here is a site you should check out. It says that it can last all day:  http://www.welcomebabyhome.com/pregnancy...    But I would definately consult a doctor if you are worried about it.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	You need to go to the doctor and get medicine for that. My doctor prescribed the most wonderful medicine in the world. It dissolves in your mouth because I had a really hard time swallowing because of my gag reflex. Anyway, seriously you can get really dehydrated and end up in the hospital. Good luck... and get some meds... it will make your life so much easier!|`|zSABr7praa	Your doctor can prescribe you an anti-nausea medication, and i've been told vitamin b6 helps!  Your "morning" sickness sounds really, really awful.  It might be a good idea to get to the doctor as soon as you can because your risking severely dehydrating yourself(which can cause miscarriages) by vomiting all the time, and not being able to keep liquids down, he may want to put you on an IV!  My sister in law had the stomach flu for two days when she was in her first trimester, and her doctor had her come in to get on an IV because she was so dehydrated.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I had horrible morning sickness, just like you stated. My obgyn suggested 1/2 a unisom tablet and 25 MG of vitamin B6 4 times a day. It is a common drug combination used to fight off morning sickness.     It made my life more tolerable.     Google it and then call your OBGYN|`|eVK2zZsOaa	I am one of the lucky few who didn't have morning sickness but I know someone who did. Her morning sickness was so bad that she ended up having to go to the doctor and I believe they had to give her something to ease it. You might want to let your doctor know that you are experiencing this and see what he/she can do for you.

Yes, it will be tougher for you because a lot of parents go for the cute little kids, but don't let yourself down. There is always a chance. I know because I have an adopted sister myself.

hieQHR0daa	Your friend needs to sit this mum down and have a frank chat with her about all of this. She needs to point out that, while she is very grateful for all the help and support she has received and while there will always be a place in friends life for mum the time has come for her to go it alone.  Your friend needs to  have this discussion in a determined assertive but non confrontational way. Her mum will cope but both need to sort out the new rules and game plan.
CcgDj9GIaa	No not at all!    You're supposed to gain between 30 and 40 pounds while pregnant.  I'm 17 weeks 4 days and I gained 12 pounds.  It's completely normal.|`|zSABr7praa	I've gained 15 so far!  But i also quit smoking when I found out I was pregnant, so I put on a little extra weight through out that process!  You're suppose to gain weight when your pregnant.  I would be concerned if you had gained 25, but 8 I think is right on target.  It your doctor is not worried, you don't need to be either.  There is a "baby weight calculator" on babycenter.com  Best of luck.|`|Lck9Fg04aa	im 25weeks and gained 11 pounds,  so no i dont think that is bad at all.  its hard for any woman to gain weight lol, but try enjoy this and dont worry so much.  its all worth it in the end|`|79eRDIbXaa	Sounds fine to me. Im nearly 20 weeks and have gained just 2 pounds but this is down to sickness and lack of appetite. I did loose 4 pounds up until 2 weeks ago. Make sure you eat when you are hungry and not to worry about your weight to much as baby needs all nnutrientsit can get. Congratz and Good Luck xx
fbbd8990856c83abb2849c2b3d9ad5eeaa	My boyfriend thinks I spend too much money on makeup. It's not like I go out and spend hundreds of dollars every week on makeup, but I buy MAC and bare minerals and nicer makeup when I do happen to purchase makeup. I only replace things when I run out, and last time I went and bought some stuff I spent like $80 because I ran out of a lot of things at once and my boyfriend was like, "Holy crap! I didn't know being a girl was so expensive!"|`|FegAXbgiaa	No i usually buy things from ebay and i am also quite tight with money : D|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Things are super tight around here. I don't buy anything at all unless it's absolutely necessary, I don't want to put more of a strain on our finances.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I have it pretty good in that area, my husband goes out and makes the money, he never asks what i do with it, as long as the bills are paid and he has food in his belly. I get his paycheck so its almost like being paid to stay home, all he asks is for some pocket money (which of course i give him) we joke that its his allowance lol. if  you would ask him what kind of bills we have or how much is in our checking account, he wouldnt have a clue.    why thumbs down? this isnt even a question that requires thumbs....some people, i swear.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	Not really, we both pretty much get our own money, and the child tax and child benefit all goes on out daughter. He does moan a bit if I bring her home a new toy, mostly because they annoy him. At the moment her newest toy is a disco duck and he hates it as it goes on constantly.|`|wENdWT5kaa	quite the opposite here. He's the one that spends too much money and he is the one telling me to buy myself something.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	My husband says I spend too much on everything.  :-)  Mainly clothes for our boys and toys.  I can't help it, you're shopping, and you see something you know your child will like and get all excited and have to buy it. Not overly expensive things, but still. My hubby complains we can't go into a store without carrying something out for each kid.    What's funny, is when he goes shopping alone, he gets back with more stuff for our kids than I do. He loves us. :o)|`|f4zg7LHLaa	he doesn't think i spend too much money, because i don't tend to buy things if my son doesn't need them, because his grandparents like to buy him stuff, so if i did it too, the walls of our flat would be bursting!    he does moan when i buy another cleaning product though! just yesterday we had an argument over a bottle of Milton spray.....|`|QveBSjFSaa	No, I am fortunate in that way, my husband has never sweated me about money, or my spending habits, but I also am extremely thrifty as well.  In fact, he's the one who usually tells me" I see that your shoes/bras/chonies are falling apart, why don't you get some new ones this week?".|`|prqrQcd1aa	No, not usually. I will sit here and come up with a budget for the week on what needs paid and gotten. We both go over it and he's never said anything about oh well you can't get that because we are too broke... but he has told me before to wait a week, if we can, to get certain things that we don't "need" right then and there.... especially baby wash, shampoo, conditioner, etc. lol I always want to have extra of those things, i really don't like running out!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My husband spent 4 grand on a sodding motorbike yesterday.

I can spend what i sodding well like and he better not say a damn word...|`|AA11111862	When I got pregnant ( and was with a boy) my sister-in-law gave me all her sons old clothes. She kept them like new & she always goes for the expensive brands. So, now if i spend anything on clothes for my son my husband doesn't really say anything. We don't spend a lot. 90% of everything we have for our son ( from crib to toys) was from my sister in law or from the baby shower.   What my husband does complain about is how much i spend on magazines ( yeah i am addicted) and 99 cent store junk. Sometimes you just get the spending bug.|`|ZejwYamhaa	Lol yeh when my kids were younger my husband constantly complained about everything i bought. It got to the stage that my husband set up an automatic text message to be sent to me whenever i spent $200 or more saying 'PUT THE CREDIT CARD AWAY'|`|WQR0KEqZaa	yes all the time, i don't always show him what ive bought or i say it was in the sale!! lol  but it does wind me up when i have to justify what i spend.|`|AA11437439	my hubby used to complain at the space i took up with my arts and crafts hobbies but now that i am established in that we think of it as a self financing hobby (not earning enough to call it a business) that provides some pocket monies for me as well as getting me out of the house and meeting new people at suitable tabletop/christmas/fundraisng/art and craft events in the community.    my son is turning out much like me in that respect in that at 10 years old he is always making something or other - in fact he made a life size skeleton and drew in the main organs out of paper for a homework last month that drew much admiration from his head teacher at school|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	My dad used to get annoyed at my mum for spending too much money on renting videos (back in the day)|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	No he doesn't. My hubby thinks I am a cheapskate. He has problems saving money and has recently told me that maybe I should be in charge. Although we just got our tax return and will be using to help move and he is afraid I will buy too much stuff for the new place. I did last time and learned from my mistakes, we won't buy anything for it until after we move in. But he is still scared. But at the same time he asked me to spend some money on myself as well. so confusing, men are.|`|GnXfEdegaa	No, my husband trusts with money.  I have never given him any reason not to.

I didn't say it was easy, tho.|`|zMNgG9m0aa	I still don't understand how men think us buying supplies for the kids is somehow stuff for us!!!! I don't want new lunch boxes, but I get comments on such a purchase... ffs. woman buy trinkets for themselves, little things here and there, but when men spend money they tend to buy very expensive "toys" for themselves. don't worry, it will come and you'll get years out guilt free spending :)|`|a35650a2d4dd8438b175c12703752380aa	My answer to that is all the clothing i buy my boys is always bought on sale i always wait for NEXT to have there sale and buy all the clothing for that year yes it's a fortune in money but i tell him how much more it would have cost at full price i think he now gets the message|`|BnYrOfYraa	No, because we live on a tight budget, we generally don't spend any money unless we discuss it with each other first.  I tell him and he tells me.  We don't have any credit cards, just the check card attached to our bank account.    Works for us, but I get that may not work for others.
cYRZpGkqaa	My parents started foster care when I still lived at home, so I will give you my personal experience.  Pros:  -You're giving a child a chance at a new life  -You're showing a child what it is like to be loved and cared for  -You get to teach them acceptable behaviors (tough, but rewarding)  -You're growing mentally and spiritually as you care for these children, because each child will touch your heart in a new and special way that you never knew possible.  -You get to teach them to love!  -You know that they will be safe, fed, and in a nice warm bed each night  -More often than not, you have a child there who loves to be nurtured constantly, and the best part is that they never grow out of it  Cons:  -Sometimes the children are "difficult" because of their background  -Sometimes they treat you terribly because you're not as permissive as their parents  -It can be easy to get frustrated at times (My parents are now adopting one of their foster children and my husband hides his frustration at him. He is almost four, but his mother smoked crack when she was pregnant leaving him on the level of a two year old in many ways. It upsets my husband when he hits our 1 yo, but I always remind him that there are some things that he won't be able to understand.)  -Any time they leave your home, they take a piece of your heart with them. I have mourned many times seeing the children go back to their natural parents. It is the hardest part, and I have never stopped thinking and praying for any of these children.  -It's important to keep in mind that no matter how much you love and care for some children, they will not budge. Sometimes their life has already been too traumatic and they require professional conseling.    When my parents got new placements, it always depended on the age as to what they did. With younger children they had a healthy snack ready, plenty of toys out, and they would show them their rooms. After the case worker would leave, they would get down on the floor and play and talk with them. For preteens-teens there would be a nice hot meal waiting, they would get a tour of the house, and then we would all sit down together as a family and eat a meal. We would talk to them, broach their likes and dislikes, and get a general feel of their personality.|`|Wytd3dajaa	Some of the kids I work with are fostered. The basic con of all cons is that sometimes you might get attached to a child that you can't keep. The main pro is taking a child out of a terrible situation and having some input on the person they become with your love and care.  The pro's outweigh the cons.  Welcoming them into your home should come pretty easily. Offer to cook them something they like. Let them know all about you and your family. Give them opportunities they might not receive otherwise, like good schooling, etc...|`|os36Q3P2aa	i agree with answer  1...the biggest problem is getting attached to a kiddie that you cant keep..     my mum and dad went down the route of fostering ,they done all the courses/training  etc etc both said they had seen some awful things through out their experience.I gues you would have to be the kinda person that can put your emotions to one side to allow you to do the best for those kids that very unfortunatly end up in foster homes.  after  they were approved  (for special needs fostering) my dad was diagnosed with cancer so it didnt happen in the end.    there are lots of pro's and con's but then thats the same as having your own children ...its a huge commitment,lots of legal  stuff involved  .I think foster parents are amazing,more are needed and wanted .  i take my hat off to those that can and do ,do it !|`|GnXfEdegaa	We were foster parents for 9 yrs.  The pros are you can make a child's life happier & healthier. The cons are some of the kids come from abusive, neglectful homes and as a result of that show all signs of acting out. A foster parent should listen to the child, showing respect and love.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	My aunt and uncle were foster parents for years and now a couple of our friends are.      From the experience I have seen the pros are you re able to help a child who has no one else to turn to and you are keeping that child out of an institution.  You also have the extra hugs once that child knows that they can trust you.    The cons are getting attached and then the child being returned to it's parent.  You also have to deal with emotional outburst, destructive behavior and many other issues these children bring into your lives. Your own children often get shunned because the foster child resents them and what they have.    Becoming a foster parent is a great thing and can be very rewarding.  First you need to ge all the family on board.  Make a space, even if it is sharing a room, for the child to feel that they belong there.  Ask them what they like and don't like, treat them as you do your own kids not making them feel less of a person.  Be there for them if they want to talk and make appointments for you with a counselor or your priest so you have someone to talk to and vent to.  Don't push the child to talk and open up until they are ready, remember they have been through the wringer and have to know they can trust you first.    No matter how hard it was a first the ones I know who have been and are foster parents have never regretted it.|`|EYYNtf3Gaa	For the child, the pros due out way the cons. However, please be aware that most children don't want to be removed from their home, no matter what the situation.    Many, who have Fostered, said they become attached to the children. I commend those, even though it is hard not too form an attachment. I know we did with so many children we Fostered. But isn't that what a Family is all about??    Finally, I would like to share a link with information that may be the worst con of being a Foster Parent, no I should say any Parent. This is being accused of Child Abuse. And so many times the accusation is entirely untrue. The site should be listed, but here it is http://nfpcar.org    I am a strong believer that Families are the most important resource we have. May you find strength in Your Higher Power, GranPa Chuck|`|mg9ZFYc1aa	I personally believe being a good foster parent involves advocating for the children even if this means you are not popular. I concur with the previous responses so I won't repeat. I am a foster parent and I have found that many foster parents will fear a case worker, their supervisor or other parties as their excuse as not to advocate for a child. It needs to be said though that it is not easy or simple in determining how and when to advocate or in what way. There are times when doing nothing and waiting it out is better, other times it is not. Dealing with people is a regular thing and people are people and this is a whole world out there that is very sad on one end and very rewarding on the other. Know what your motive is, do what feels right for you and the children you are caring for, don't sweat the small stuff and know what that is. I love being a foster parent, I hate dealing with the system but it is what it is and the kids are worth it. I have adopted within the system and hope to again.
DN6XtoViaa	it normally takes 6-12 months to get pregnant. those that get pregnant before the 6 month mark are luckily. :(    since your cycles are pretty regular i would start using the kit on cycle day 10 as you are probably ovulating on day 14.    good luck!|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	i know how you feel, my 1st AF has showed since my miscarriage on tuesday. thought maybe some magic baby dust may have fertilised my 'very fertile body' but nope- no such luck. i hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i want a baby!!!!!!!!!! it'll happen for us tho, i'm starting to believe that! my hubby told me last nite when i was crying that we'll appreciate more this time around, i hope so
1KIwM1uOaa	I know what you are going through and you are right it is tough.    Our son is now 9 but from the time he started pre k he has had problems at school.  At first it was the boys will be boys thing and we finally had to admit it was more than that.      your first step should be to sit down with the pediatrician and have them do a screening on your daughter.  They will give you forms to fill out about behavior at home and then will send another to all the teachers your daughter has.  This way they can determine whether it is ADD or ADHD that your daughter has.    When it comes to the medicine we have tried several.  The non stimulant Strattera works pretty well for ADD but not as effective for ADHD. The stimulants Concerta, Ritalin, Adderal they all work well but are more addictive in nature and have more side effects.  of those three Adderal would be the best but it may cause weight loss.  We finally went with Vyvanse last year and so far it has been the best of all the meds we tried.  It is a stimulant but has less side effects and it is one we can hold on the weekends and during school breaks without causing problems.    Research all of those meds and then sit down with your doctor and go from there.  They will usually see your daughter more often when she first starts taking it watchig for side effets etc.  Also remember they are controlled drugs so you will have to go to the doctor more often for the refills.  Good luck to you.  I know first hand how frustrating this can be.|`|FAkkLDxjaa	We are trying Vyvanse and it is a great one without the colored coating. We are also doing the Feingold Diet for ADHD/ADD/autism. Trust me it works. Please consider doing this as well. Let me know if you have any questions. Don't hesitate to ask. I've been there and done that.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	There are lots of medicines out there, and really you should consult with her pediatrician and the prescribing doctor (if that person is different than your ped).     One thing I will ask, though - is she enrolled in sports? Any physical activity? My husband had ADD as a child, and was on meds for a while, but he hated it. His parents enrolled him in athletic and after school activities (he did wrestling as a young boy) and it helped tremendously.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	You need to see a neuropsychologist    You need to get your child tested    At age five, she may be to young for an Adhd diagnoses  I was told Seven is the youngest for a diognoses    At five, she may not have ADHD  You need to be careful    You need to see a doctor|`|2cstdEkIaa	give the kid chores and enroll them in a sport where you burn lots of energy..like soccer..worked for my 6 yr old son|`|dq04utMoaa	You might be surprised however the doctor might not give you a RX.

tXlvg1ahaa	My grandma always told us this trick they used to do on men in the old days when she was a teenager.    First of all, the girl must go commando on the day that she plans her action.  She should wear a flair type skirt and a pretty blouse....  Once she has his attention, she must squat on one knee as if to tie a shoe lace, and allow him to "accidentally" see that she is going commando.  She must not let him look for long enough that he can actually see clearly, but keep him guessing if he had seen what he had actually seen.  She says that this uncertainty sparks a man's interest and keeps them pursuing the girl until she gives in.|`|7rEMTohxaa	just tell him that you like him - ask him if you can go and see a film with him. touch his wrist when you laugh.  but let him know that you enjoy his company, its always important for the boy's ego.|`|Ai9VR41Waa	Keep the conversations going.  If you know he likes sports .. ask him if he's going to the big basketball game at the end of the week.  Tell him you're going too and if he goes maybe you could sit together.  If that ends up happening .. during the game ask if he'd like to go out for pizza afterward ... little steps could lead to bigger ones later on!  Good luck to you!|`|BQYXgtq7aa	Talk to him. Make the first step. Chances are he's just as frightened and unsure as you are!  Perhaps ask if he'd like to sit with you during lunch, see a movie after school, go to the skate park, etc...  You don't say how old you or he are so it's difficult to give more appropriate advice.   If you find out he likes you, ask him out! Do it when its just the two of you, none of your of his friends around, and just voice your interest in him and that you would like to get to know him. Is he interested? If he is hesitant, tell him that if he likes he can think about it and get back to you at the end of the day or the next morning or whatever.  Good luck, probably wont be the last time you'll be unsure!!|`|3IXDx9nhaa	Be direct.  Give him a note with your home phone number or email address and see how he responds, then take it from there.

If you ask me, its all day every day sickness. For many of us, dealing with the queasiness and nausea of morning sickness is the hardest part about being pregnant. Thankfully there are quite a few easy and natural ways to improve the way you feel without harming your baby. Here are a few of my favorite remedies to give you morning sickness relief.    Eat small meals spread out through the day. This way your stomach is never quite empty which helps prevent excessive stomach acid. Eating small meals will also keep you from eating too much at once, which can also make you feel sick.    Drink plenty of water. Carry a cup or a water bottle with you at all times and sip throughout the day. The water is important for the overall health and wellbeing of both you and your baby. It will also dilute any stomach acid, keeping you from getting quite as sick.    Take your prenatal vitamins right before you go to sleep at night. Mine used to make me really sick, even if I took them with a full meal. Taking them at night, right before I went to bed, allowed me to fall asleep before I started getting sick. Take them with a snack, like a bowl of cereal, or some crackers and cheese.    Ginger and peppermint will both help with nausea. Carry some ginger snaps, or some candied ginger with you. Nibble on it when you feel the first signs of morning sickness. Carry some peppermint candy or gum with. For bad cases of morning sickness, a cup of peppermint tea always helped me. It may be worth a try.    Please check with your OBGYN about these tips on morning sickness relief before implementing them.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Don't worry, it's perfectly normal to have things like this change or come and go. It doesn't mean anything has happened to your baby. The sickness and other pregnancy symptoms are because your body is getting used to the hormones and changes that it is going through. As you get used to it symptoms will pass and you'll feel lots better. You also getting towards the end of you 1st trimester, only a few weeks to go, so it's common to see these symptoms go and pretty soon you'll be feeling 100% better!|`|4v90WyUhaa	Be glad you aren't sick all day everyday like I was. With both my kids I was sick every single day. I'd throw up so much I actually lost 11 pounds in a month with my first. I didn't start feeling better til I started taking Phenergan but that made me sleepy. Don't worry about it hurting the baby though. Even though I got sick like I did both mine weighed good at birth. If you're worried though call your doctor.
XsKXmXsJaa	Take pregnancy test or use pregnancy strips. And if she is not pregnant then do intercourse in save period.     Here is how to calculate save sex period or fertile period:    First, one should know the duration of the cycle, i.e. first day of the last menstrual bleeding to the first day of the present menstrual bleeding. This is the duration of the menstrual cycle.     This duration varies from person to person & is usually between 26 to 31 days.     Ovulation approximately occurs in the middle of the cycle, i.e. duration of the cycle - (minus) 14 days (this also varies).     A week before and a week after the approximate day of ovulation is considered to be Fertile period.     The days apart from this is called the safe periods, where the fertilization does not takes place.     So, to calculate the safe period you must know the fertile period.     Calculation of fertile period: The shortest cycle minus 18 days=1st day of fertile period. The longest cycle minus 10 days= last day of fertile period.     Ex: if a women's menstrual cycle varies from 26days to 31days cycle,   The shortest cycle [26days] minus18days=8th day.   The longest cycle [31days] minus 10days=21st day.     Thus, 8th to 21st day of each cycle counting from first day of menstrual period is considered as fertile period.     Period other than this fertile period in a menstrual cycle is considered as SAFE PERIOD.     If one wants to avoid pregnancy avoid intercourse during fertile period. Safe period is safe for sexual activity.|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	yes|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I had my period for the first three months of my first pregnancy.

WXIoUwIBaa	An excellent resource for planning a baby shower can be found at http://www.baby-shower.com/sections/surv...  In regards to the actual big day, I would recommend reading the good hostess's guide to surviving a shower.  You can find it at http://www.baby-shower.com/good-hostess/...      Basically, women will play games, talk, open presents and eat.  It is pretty similar to any other party except it is only women (unless you are having a couple's shower) and it is focused on baby.    www.baby-shower.com|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	At my shower, gifts were brought for me, we played baby related games and had some food. It was lovely!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Most of the showers I've been too were mostly about finger food, chatting and lots of wine.  Except for the pregnant woman, unfortunately.  Then you get gifts and you have to open them in front of everyone, a tradition that I personally find kind of awkward.  Some people like to play games.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Games, although not always; eating, socializing, and watching the new mom open her presents!|`|S4dLfbHAaa	I was at a baby shower at the weekend - the format was:  7.00-7.30 drinks, nibbles and general chat until everyone arrived  7.30-8.00 a couple of games (including splitting into teams and guessing the price of various baby items (nappies, wipes, baby powder etc) which was then all put into a basket for the mum-to-be)  8.00-9.00 dinner  9.00-9.30 a couple more games, including musical chairs but with a balloon between your legs (the mum-to-be sat this out but was practically in hysterics watching the rest of us!) and everyone having to cut a piece of string to how big we thought the bump was, with a prize for the closest  9.30-10 - mum-to-be opened all her presents, more chat and nibbles and then home.

09zVUMBRaa	I wouldn't take a sleep aid, unless it's a natural one, while I'm pregnant.  Just because a doc says it's alright doesn't make it alright.  After all, they do need malpractice insurance for a reason.  They make mistakes.|`|AA11661793	my doctor said I can take benadryl  or Tylenol pm to help me sleep if needed, I think unisom is on the list too but i have never taken it.|`|g5xnXkQkaa	My doc told me tylenol pm was safe havent taken it but thats what I was told!!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	There are medications that Dr's prescribe for sleeping. They do carry some risk but the Dr will always take care of the mother first. If the benefits outweigh the potential risks, they will give the mother the medicine. Not sleeping is unhealthy too. I have taken Tylenol Pm before. It is perfectly safe to take occasionally. (it is only Tylenol and Benadryl..both are safe to take while pregnant) You say that you wouldn't take anything no matter how much trouble you have, but you say that bc I am assuming you have had no real trouble sleeping or been in a lot of pain while pregnant. I agree with you that no one should take anything that isn't necessary but try not sleeping for 3 days straight and then say you wouldn't. Or break your leg in a car accident while you are pregnant. There are safe medications to take while pregnant if taken correctly and only when truly needed.|`|eRMHaZGYaa	Apparently now there are a lot of medications you can take while pregnant, however what the doctors will say is that  this medications is not KNOWN to hurt the baby, doesn't mean it has been 100% approved. I have extream insomnia during my current pregnancy, hot milk and decaff or fruit iinfused teas help. I personally wouldnt take sleeping pills, because 1. lolol... I am letting my sleepless nights  prepare me for whats to come.. and as long as she is not working her restlessness does not effect the baby if she as least is resting and taking it easy.. if she has to work or drive during the day I could see how insomnia could cause greater effects to her life, and the last things doctors will do is let a mom be uncomfortable, if something is unbearable.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	I knew a girl who when pregnant with her fifth child the doctors gave her sleeping medication which she took every single night and the baby was ok.    I am currently 30 weeks pregnant with my fifth child and I have been offered sleeping meds from doctors which i wouldnt take but i will take pain medication if i need to, pregnancy gets more uncomfortable and painful each time you do it (in my experience).|`|Hhifw93laa	its fine the docs know what they are doing really you can take unisom as directed or Tylenol pm it don't really pass through the blood stream and trust me its a good thing because lack of sleep puts you at a bigger risk of having a miscarriage so its on you if your prego weather you want to risk losing your baby for some sleep this is her pregnancy so let her do what she thinks is right you will have your turn God bless|`|kprKXEOSaa	Some doctors are much more cautious about prescribing medications for pregnant women, others not so much.  In the end it is basically up to the patient to decide if they want to take the medication or not.    For morning sickness, many doctors recommend taking 1/2 of a Unisom tablet and vitamin B6.  So I would guess it would be ok to take 1/2 of a Unisom tablet to sleep.  Other than that, her doctor can recommend what he thinks is ok, and it's up to her to decide in the end.    I'm also very careful about what I take while pregnant, but some people just aren't as worried.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	You can take 1/2 a unisom tablet. That is it.     Everything else is a class C drug and they do not know the effects on a baby.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I wouldn't take anything other than Bendadryl, honestly. Prescription sleeping pills always have the potential to be addictive. ANd if they're taken regularly, they might become less effective. Maybe once in a while is okay, but I definitely would not take it on a regular basis.|`|NaYb4CnGaa	my doc told me to take benadryl to help my sleep, i was told by my doc that anything stronger or really anything that is taken daily while pregnant can make the baby have withdraw problems after birth because its so used to having the medications you take while pregnant. but docs know better than me.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Yes you can take it. My midwife gave me some tea that helps me get to sleep. I didn't have that much trouble, just I can't get to sleep again when I wake up to pee. It's not for long term. They usually just give you a few to help you get back on schedule.|`|UzvoQvB2aa	not prescription strength but I've taken unisom while pregnant|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	get a second and if necessary third opinion, why risk the baby's health, sounds like trouble to me
AA11481889	I had to file for my "benefits" when I received state income for maternity leave...I can't even imagine why any of the other benefits wouldn't also be taxable income.    I think that's disgusting that she's pocketing all that cash while getting tax payers benefits year round.    So I guess of course the only decent thing to do would be to go to the welfare office and have them reduce her benefits by 500 bucks a month to compensate for the tax return.    It's sickening to me how abused the system is...it's no bloody wonder why we're in the mess we're in with so many people taking advantage.    Personally, I think no one should even get benefits unless they turn in financial statements, including tax returns and they should also be drug tested.    Benefits are a privilege, not a right, so there's nothing wrong with making people actually fill some requirements before getting piles of tax dollars for nothing.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	It makes me angry.  Not the person in this situation, the tax credit part.  I agree w/ Des to a degree but I'm not sure the credits and assistance is set up fairly for everyone.  I'm going to e-mail you my answer.  I typed it but erased it b/c it's not very PC and I don't want to offend anyone.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	No:  that would be ridiculously inefficient if the government handed out assistance and that taxed that same money, essentially demanding a percentage of it back.  The government would be losing interest on the money in the meanwhile plus would have the costs of enforcement on getting the taxable portion back.    The money you get back from your tax returns is not the government's giving you money:  it is your own money that you overpaid in your tax withholdings during the year.  It's not that she got $10k in government funds from her return ... it's that her withholdings were too high and the government took $10k of her money out of her paychecks that was rightfully hers to begin with.      brass monkey -- a fair point; i was not thinking that of course she must be very low income and so wouldn't have paid in that much to begin with.  still, it makes much more sense for the government to calibrate the amount of benefits to give out with those tax credits in mind (don't you think they do consider that?) than to pay benefits and then tax them right back.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I think they should. It is like an extra income when you get all the free stuff from the government. The system is so screwed up, it shouldn't be a lifestyle, just a stepping stone. They should have a bell ringer system for people who know of those abusing the system...|`|j2mRop0laa	Well, I sort of look at it like this. That 10k will probably help benefit the kids in *some* way. She is a single mom with 5 kids, so no matter her reason for working (I'll pretend I didn't hear that she can't stand to be around her kids),she probably doesn't make enough to purchase clothes for 5 kids for 3 seasons a year. It might help her with birthdays and activities etc.    I don't know. I don't think they should have to show benefits as income. Just because some people abuse the system, not all do.   When Clinton was President, the laws were changed in our state that you could only get continuous benefits up until your youngest child was 5, you were going to school, or working a 30 hour a week job that offered health benefits. So I do think the government TRIES to put strict standards on welfare, but it is very difficult to monitor each and every single case.    I like to think she will use that 10k wisely.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	This is what I think:  I think the government gives these women all this help so they should STAY at home and take care of their children, not go out and work.  Some have jobs and work late at night as a waitress while their kids are at home by themselves.  They also wait tables so they can really make more than they are reporting, and some don't even punch in when they really should.  So the government doesn't really know how much they make.  Or they could be self employed adn get paid under the table while only reporting just enough so they can qualify for the benefits.  Sometimes you get bent out of shape hearing about this, but on the other hand why shouldn't they.  It's not like it's really come out of our pockets is it?  If the government can screw us over then why shouldn't they screw the government!|`|TQW5E6olaa	In CA, you have to list all non taxable income in your return, including child support and unemployment, etc.    I'm jealous. I work my butt off, get no assistance and my return is measly, lucky her.|`|zd6lRfIXaa	I don't know about using them as income, but certainly something should be done. I don't understand how some people can get more of a return than they actually paid in taxes. Seems wrong. Oh well, I guess since our government is debt free and has all the other needs of our country met with money left over why not give it out for free. Oh wait... We're not in good financial shape?|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Yes actually that should be included in. Not to be taxed, but any assistance should figure in to the income somehow. But, if she isn't making enough she won't qualify for the earned income credit, or at least not all of it. I know because last year I got $4000/ income $15k and this year I didn't get much at all because I only made $2000 this year so I'm not even going to file.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Since she would undoubtedly be getting EIC due to the low salary anyway, I think benefits should be reported but not as income (such as child support).    Technically we're eligible for EIC but because I inherited a farm and sold it, we were able to buy our house/land. The accountant last year was basically trying to convince us to get every red cent we could....I thought it was really appaling and I said no. We have been very fortuanate and have no real need and yet we had someone telling us since we're here, we're entitled to everything.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Well that particular situation paints a bad picture of the assistance program.  I like to believe that those people are the minority and not the majority.  I like to believe that.  I personally feel, the whole system needs to be revamped.  I firmly believe in a system that helps people who are need.  I truly do.  But the system as it is, is flawed.  I think that should be just as important as any other thing this country is working on to be fixed.  I don't believe the system as a whole has been revamped too much since it was instituted all those years ago.  I want it to be able to help people in need, people who help themselves, and enable people to transition off of it.  I want people to be able to not get sucked into a cycle.  I still like to believe in the majority that do not abuse the system.  It helps me sleep better at night.  :-)|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Actually Jane, it COULD happen. My husband & I have 2 children, only made less that $26K this year and we got back almost $8K from the IRS.     Anyways, no I don't think it should. They are paying medicare taxes anyways which is paying for their medical. I think that Cash benefits should be included as income though since it's actual cash and not a card to be used on food purchases.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well, it's money coming into the home so i think it would be fair that at least a certain percentage be taken out of the taxes.|`|9kPPmazoaa	What bothers me is I see how many thousands of dollars the hubby and I pay in taxes each year. And we receive barely any of it back. But then someone else who hasn't paid nearly as much taxes receives thousands more then they paid!!! Its not right. I can't help but believe that my money is going to them!!!    I am all for assistance for single parents. I have a family member who is a single parent and works her butt off she deserves every dime she recieves... and doesn't get any assistance.     But it bothers me that a married couples almost always gets way less back in taxes when nine times out of ten they are paying tons more each year. I don't understand it. We have a child too... why should the single parent get more money back because "they" have a child. When they are already getting financial help. (For those that are already getting plenty financial help) I agree some "need" the tax money.    ***And no not all the money they "get back" is taxes "they" overpaid that year.    *Its called "getting taxes back" so why/how should a person who hasn't paid that amount in taxes recieved that much "back"?|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I don't think that the system should be changed because it helps needy families.  I think that even if you claim all five kids, the max EIC would be for two kids.  Then I'm assuming she'd file as Head of Household and get that deduction.  It's meant to be a good thing for good, working people, so we can't change just because there are abusers.    Edit:  To anyone that thinks it's not fair, you have the right to your opinion.  But look at it from my point of view.  I have two children and an extremely sick husband.  I pay all of the bills, rent, heating gas, electric, car payment, insurance, medical bills, food and any extras like gas for my vehicle or the one night a month I may go out to eat, clothes for my rapidly growing children, my husband's prescriptions.  I live in Cleveland, the economy here sucks.  I haven't gotten a raise in almost three years, I can't find another job and my husband's social security is pending.  Now, I'm going to get almost $6000 back.  I think I deserve this money.  I work hard to support my family and I appreciate the money that I'm going to be receiving.|`|KXd5gc0eaa	i mean don't they tax teachers so why not. Kinda the same concept.|`|ZejwYamhaa	I doubt someone who is a single parent who supports 5 children and relies on food stamps, medicaid, child support and rental assistance who uses her entire wage to send her children to daycare would be getting $10k on her tax return anyways.|`|GnXfEdegaa	I can't believe that someone w/5 kids and on welfare would get that much back from income taxes. How can that be?|`|vJEatJFPaa	Wow. With receiving all the help from the government plus getting almost $10,000 back in tax returns?????    I honestly don't know...Half of me gets pissed that she gets ALL that $ back and then half of me can't judge because I don't know her ir her full situation.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I think you should be able to get up to the amount you paid in taxes back at the end of the year.   But, we paid in about $40,000 in taxes last year and we will be getting about $2000 back and that's only because we can claim the interest on our house and our baby.  If I was getting $10k back I might not mind as much.    Edit:  Des, you can get back more than you paid in at the end of the year using the EIC and child tax credits - especially if you have 5 kids.  If the woman made, let's say $20,000 last year, she definitely didn't pay in $10,000 in taxes - $10,000 in taxes would be at least $40,000 a year, at which point she wouldn't qualify for the assistance she is getting - poverty level for a family of 6 is $28,400 so in order to qualify for all that assistance she gets, she would have to make less than that a year.    Edit2: Des, I agree that the benefits shouldn't be taxed, but I also think that it's unproductive to not only give her back all her taxes (which I think is fine - she is low income and could use all of her money) but to also give her some of someone else's tax dollars back?  It makes no sense to me.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I know someone who does something like this. They claim anything income they can and then get the child tax credits so they get any income tax they paid back plus all the child tax credits. They are on food stamps too so us taxpayers are really paying for them big time. I don't like it. If you get benefits you shouldn't get a tax return bigger than what you paid into taxes.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Wow, I didn't realize that was happening. I guess I live in a hole.     Heck yes I think they should have to report all of it. When I was raising my first child (alone), I struggled. I didn't use assistance because I thought I should work hard and leave it for someone who may really need it. However, it never failed, I would go grocery shopping and buy my off brand hot dogs, mac and cheese and 1lb of hamburger. And, behind me would be someone with a bridgecard buying shrimp, t-bones and filets. I would get so pi**ed.  And one day as I was leaving, I saw a lady pouring her pop out (that she had just bought), I watched her get the bottle return and buy cigerattes with it. Isn't that a crock.    I really think that everyone should ahve to report income, no matter if it is assistance or not. Wy should anyone have a leg up on another!|`|iG0nAZKGaa	Seen it i n many  situations n don't find it to be right either.It  has brought the lower class to the middle class bracket on the tax payers expense.They should not get more taxes back when they never paid them in.Totally wrong|`|eF6HTt0gaa	My husband who is a honorably discharged Marine revices monthy stipends that he always claims on the taxes we send in. Your supposed to.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	In my state you DO have to file your assistance as non taxable income on your state return. What bothers me is here in MN your refund can not count against you as an asset as long as you spend it before your next Household report form is due. Which means these people getting back a $10k refund are having to spend the money very fast and not using it wisely. Since vehicles, CD's, property, and snowmobiles/ATV's also count against you these people are buying clothing, electronics, and other items just to stay on assistance. That $10k in actuality is more than she is receiving yearly from assistance and could be put to use helping the mother instead of being wasted on frivolties. Here it isn't uncommon to see low income families buying a 54 inch tv with a tax return. If your living in an appartment with a 54 inch tv, playstation 3, and a blueray player should you qualify for assistance? My answer is no. Your no longer looking for help your looking for a free ride.|`|p61Ccuvyaa	for one thing are you jealous of the girl???  It is hard to be a single mother more less 5 children and i have read some of the responses.. you say you the tax payer is paying for her food stamps well you the tax payer is getting money at the end of the year proppablly more than what you even put into your taxes through the year so you the tax payer are not paying for her food stamps.. medicaid she pays for that herself if she is working.. the government put these things out there for people to get help.. so what shes getting back 10 k who cares that is that girls business not yours that is what is wrong with this world not people living off the government people like you all up in her business.. obviously your not her friend to question her and the way she lives her life.. my advice to you is if you have to post a question like that about the girl then you need to leave her alone b/c obviosly your not her friend get a damn life.....

I have heard that a breastfed baby might poop once every day or once every other day, but that a bottlefed baby could go up to 3-4 days without pooping.    I have never heard the formula thing either!  Where I come from everyone says, a baby will eat when they are hungry!  Plus all the books out there say that a baby will never over eat, so feed them whenever they want and feed them as much as they want!|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	The misconception I would like to clear up is all babies are different.  I had people constantly compering how my baby wasn't sleeping like they should because their baby did  this  the same with feedings and how warmly baby needs to be dressed.     With my first I was told a number of times I was going to freeze my son ( even told I would kill him) because I had to dress him light clothing He would get over heated and vomit if dressed to warm.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	That crying is "good for their lungs" and sometimes they "need to cry it out." I have heard those statements many times regarding my son and other babies.|`|AA11101968	They need to be purged of original sin.|`|ke0dsgkkaa	One guy asked my husband after our first born, when do they open their eyes? That was really a weird question.   I do know my babies were two that slept most every night, all night, I was blessed.|`|XZxNQSlVaa	My mom did sleep train me at 5 weeks but I think thats terrible.    Mine DID poop every day like 10 times a day as a newborn. But I was breastfeeding.    The one I can't stand is the old people that tell you you're holding the baby too much. Holding the baby is good for the baby!    Also, some old people will say crying is good for their lungs so let them cry. What the heck?|`|JjBtgSixaa	That they are very noisy.|`|N1IQuM1jaa	that babies SHOULD do this or SHOULD do that...they are all different, and dont necessarily do what the baby books say they should!|`|hGqQIusSaa	I agree with LynnM, that babies should be doing this or shouldn't be doing that...    Each and every baby is individual and although there are general guidelines, they are not all going to do the same things at the same time.|`|a772ac727655daef254b8e6748f36d1faa	Pepole think babies are always cold.  They have the same ability to maintain their body temperature that adults do.  So if you're cold, your baby might be too.  I don't undertand why parents of newborns wrap their babies up in blankets in the middle summer.
iq5uwobOaa	just what you did.  Tell him it is like tv but at night when you sleep.  It is ok if he doesn't understand,  and I am sure he will forget about the dream later on during the day.  Just don't remind him of the bad dream.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	I think you handled that beautifully.|`|2cstdEkIaa	when you sleep your imagination runs wild. you can not change or control it, but just watch...dreams end and then you wake up. sometimes you can remember and sometimes you cant
5EiShLZZaa	Our doctor recommended the Next Step formula at 10 1/2 months (breastfed until then), it is right in between formula and whole milk, helps with the transition.  If I remember correctly, it has less calories than formula and more fat (maybe the other way around??).  With the water, I would ask your doctor first.  We have well water and it was recommended NOT to use nursery water, well water already has minerals in it (which makes it good, yum) but you don't know how much, and you can have too much fluoride.  Too much will lead to spotting on the adult teeth.  This may depend on where you live, what kind of soil/water you have, etc.  Good luck!|`|VueZ5u9Waa	I switched to the follow up formula from Goodstart and it was fine. I didn't ask my dr about it, it just has extra iron and calcium.     About the nursury water, I'm not too sure about it, I had a lot of people on here advise me against it saying it was bad, so I didn't use it. But I'm in the same predicament as you- son's getting lots of teeth and we have well water. I'm going to ask my dr about a suggestion at his 1 year check up/needles. Best of luck!|`|avx7bLnKaa	i don't know about the nursery water  but i did use the go and grow.... read up on step 2 formulas.... most research says there isn't much difference in nutrtional makeup... compare the back of the cans
TQW5E6olaa	I did a question like this recently. People just have a hard time understanding something they don't deal with, especially a medical issue.    Her father's side thinks i'm some crazy overprotective mom. Even after their Grandmother caused her to be in PICU for 3 days after only 20 minutes of contact (heavy smoker) , they still don't get it.    They don't understand why I start breathing treatments when she starts coughing or why I wont go out too much when it's cold and rainy, or why I avoid sick people like the plague, etc.    Daycare is fabulous, I've educated them to within an inch of their lives. Also my family is great, because they've gone through it with me. His family, ugh, they just think i'm nuts.     We also do daily treatmentsnd have emergency meds on hand. Not fun, but we're also hopeful she'll outgrow it.    How old is he? They say it gets easier as they get bigger...    EDIT- If he's never been admitted, that's great news. It means you are doing a fabulous job controlling it! We've kept out of hospital stays 8 months now, our next goal is staying out of the ER... Chances are his asthma will be similar to yours, so he may have it longer than you hope, but at least its controlled and you know how to help him|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I know exactly what you mean, I've experienced this too!  My oldest son gets that awful allergy cough every once in a while and people look at me like, "keep that kid away from me", "why do you have him out in public w/ that cough", etc.  When this happens I always feel the need to say to those people, "he has bad allergies" so that they know it's not contagious.  I have no idea why I do this though, it's really none of their business.    ETA:  Okay, I feel the need to edit this after reading an e-mail from another user that I just received..... I suppose in a sense it *is* their business.  I tend to forget that there are, in fact, irresponsible parents out there.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	It's not too surprising that people don't get what they don't know.  And, since the severity of different people's asthma varies wildly, sometimes they don't even get what they do know ... they assume that if  their child has mild asthma, then everybody's asthma is mild or responds immediately to an inhaler or nebulizer.    We had one year when our daughter missed a ridiculous amount of school due to severe asthma attacks and getting pneumonia twice from the things that other people experienced as mild colds.  Fortunately, after that, we got her on daily controller medications that have been amazingly effective for her, and she's virtually never sick.  But I can say I'm extremely sensitive to it when her friends with asthma come over.  Once you've seen a child gasping for breath and being put on oxygen, it's hard not to take that kind of thing seriously.    but the thing that i find that people really don't get and don't take seriously (and assume we're exaggerating about) are food allergies.  people hear "food allergy" and think "rash" (or "hypochondria") and totally don't get the concept that it can mean life-threatening anaphylaxis.|`|8zyu6FWpaa	You have my sympathy and my understanding on this one.  I suffer from allergies to smells (perfume, hairspray, cigarette smoke, etc.).  People don't understand that it's not the smell; it's the chemicals in those scents that do me in.  We who suffer from these ailments (asthma, allergies, etc.) don't want to be like this; didn't bring it on ourselves; and we aren't overly exaggerating or whining without reason.    I feel for you and hope your son improves with time and grows out of this.  Poor little fella - he's a child and needs to be able to enjoy his childhood as much as possible.  My best to you......
s6emVQleaa	Not yet and I don't know if we will.  My parents didn't have one for me, but they still helped for part of my college and the rest I have student loans for.  There is a part of me that doesn't think it's a parents responsibility at that point.  My husband parent's had an interesting deal with him.  They didn't pay for anything until he finished, but now they are paying back his student loans.|`|NuvKPl3naa	yes, having 4 children there is no way when the time comes to dish out thousands at that time. so we started one now and by the time they are in college there will be some to help. my parents did not do that for me, so therefore i did not go. but i went to college in my 20s. also we are telling out kids now WHEN you go to college........ so its in their heads they ARE going.|`|G5vGTTqhaa	Yeah. the earlier the better|`|qJquEEdmaa	no i would tell them to get a damn job and make the money themselves|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Yes, as soon as I have a child I will start to save for their college education. My parents didn't have 2 cents to rub together my whole life because of their irresponsible spending, an d as a result, I suffered and went without, and I worked my BUTT off to pay for college.. I don't want my child to have to do that.|`|AA11920812	We have a roth IRA set up for each of our sons. Although right now we have it set up to earn off of some high risk stocks we did take a hit. But, I believe we will come back from that loss over time. Heck, they are only 2 and 19 months.    We also buy bonds for birthdays and Christmas.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I have indeedo, and it will soon be time to start another|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I was very fortunate in not having to set up accounts to save. My husband has a trust fund and my children will also recieve funds from it. When they are ready for college they will not have to worry about how to pay for it.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	i have a piggy bank already going for my baby and he wont be here till june we put atleast 20 bucks a week in there worth of change|`|oIyXMnmcaa	Yes actually...this is something I have been meaning to do for ages 5 years now. I have to admit I am a procrastonator...oh boy. But you have sparked an energy in me...I cannot beleive Jasper is 5 years old now and in school; I have to get my butt into CIBC. lol    Man does time fly or what?  My parents did not have one for me. I know my grandma was going to start one but she died of cancer and thats was that. I really want to have one for my children though.|`|GQbF0Twiaa	Well my parents made one just for my college funds and it definitely added up over the years and now it helped alot to put the money away for a short time!!! glad they did it|`|GnXfEdegaa	Yes, we do and have since she was 5 and she knows it is just for that.  She also knows that she will not just be getting a free ride off Mom & Dad.  She will work part-time to contribute also before and when she goes to college.  Just hope her grades stay good and she can "make the grade"  My parents didn't have one for me or my 4 other siblings.  That's why we have all made lower paying jobs than what a college education done the right way (meaning not just to party) would have gotten us. I went to Hair Styling School.  I made a living at it, but didn't like it.  17 yrs of it.  The best thing you can teach your child is to know what he or she wants out of life.  I had no clue and followed a older friend into it, not really thinking.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	yes, the kids have 529 accounts that get funded monthly.  i'm choosing not to look at the statements again until next year.  good thing they're not going to college right after the market collapsed.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Yes. I opened a CD with part of the money we received from my MIL's life insurance money when she died, 2 mo before my son was born.     We also started a life insurance policy that will mature when he's about 20. He can decide what to do with it from there.    Also once his piggy bank is full, we will open a regular savings account.    My parents opened a savings account that I could put money into when I got it. My grandparents bought savings bonds for almost every birthday. My grandma also opened a CD that she turned over to me on my 18th birthday. And my dad started my life insurance policy - also turned over to me when I turned 18.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	Of course, universities are too expensive and i rather save and pay for my child's university education than to have them go through the same stress of taking out students loans, like what i did.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	We have a upromise account.  At this point we don't contribute to it with any actual money, just let the contributions from us buying things we already do "add" up.    If I ever feel into money or we became debt free (no mortgage) and we had our retirement secure, then yes we would.  However, at this point in time, it is more important for us to save for our own future. My kids can get scholarships, grants, and loans for school.  We can't get any of those things for our retirement.    BTW - love the new pic!
xrJqmRFqaa	My name is Kristina Michelle.      My mom's name is Christina (though she goes by Tina), so I was named after her.  She liked the name better with a K.  My middle name is my aunt's middle name.|`|8i2b0TnIaa	My name's Maria..  I was named after my grandma.;)|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	My name is Jude.  My parents say they just liked the name but personally i think they named me after the song!    I didn't get a middle name as my two older brothers second names are after our grandfathers and there was no (male) grandparent to name me after.  My younger sisters then got our grandmothers names as second names.    When i have children, i think i'll pick a first name my wife and i like and the second name will be to honour a family member.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	My mom got my name from another parent. She was at the fair and heard someone yell Tasha! and loved it.     As for picking my children's names. My oldest who's name is   Haven Rochelle I got from a book.       My boys I picked the first name i liked and gave them middles names of family members who have made an impact on my life.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Christina Ann Louise - FN: Swedish skiier in a Foldger's coffee commercial (kid you not). MNs: Ann is my grandma's middle name, Louise was my great-granny's middle name.|`|olF9Hl6saa	My son's name is Tyler Clayton. Tyler I fell in love with while I was pregnant. I was really into the movie Fight Club, and Tyler wasn't as popular as it is now. His middle name is his father's first name. His dad wanted him to be a junior... so using his dad's first name as a middle name was our compromise.|`|s40sgQ45aa	When my mom was pregnant she picked one girls name and one boys name.  Glena (a friend of the family who promised an outfit if named after her) and Thyle (a family name my great grandma made up).  Well she ended up giving birth to 2 girls.  She did not have a name for me.  My dad was suppose to be stationed in North Carolina so she named me Caroline.    As for my names I gave my children...    When I was 12 I heard the name Anastasia.  Loved it.   When I was 17 I heard the name Sebastien (not from Disney).  Loved it.  Sometime in high school a friend revealed a name she had chosen (no she was not pregnant)  It was Dakota.  Loved it.  From the age of 12 upward I would read about the history of the Last Tzar and he had another daughter Tatiana.  Loved it.|`|wOIHg0nYaa	Hannah          My parents chose it from the Bible and my mom watched the news one day and saw that News anchor.. Hannah Storm and she liked that name ^_^       I like my name also b/c it can be spelled backwards and forwards  ^_^|`|YseGAHIfaa	Mine is Lauren Victoria. I dont know how they came up with that - all I know is that my dad named me!    My baby is due in July. If i have a girl i'm gonna call her Leyla x|`|9EgS6uQzaa	Jessica Dawn    My mom really liked the name Jessica (she basically just picked it off the top 100 list) and my 2 aunts picked out my middle name.  Nothing special and my brother is John Joseph Jr.  so yeah, my parents aren't very original.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	My mom said she always loved the name Nicole and my dad liked Arienne. Then my mom stuck her maiden name in as a second middle and added my dad's last as mine also. lol i know thats a lot of name.     So obviously im   Nicole Arienne _____ ______ ( i dont want my full name on here but you get it)      My daughter is going to be Brooklyn Marie  I always liked unique names and when i heard Brooklyn i loved it (even though they used it for a boy). And my grandmothers name was Hazel Marie (she passed when i was 7). I always said i would name at least my first daughter after her. If i ever have another daughter i will try and find a name that goes good with Hazel also.|`|ZtaEg6mZaa	Chelcie- I was named after a director  Angelique- was a characters name on a show about vampires    (an-ja-leek) thats how you pronounce my middle name lol    hmmm you want to know whats interesting both my first and middle name has something to do with acting.... and thats what I want to do. haha|`|6hb04Ow0aa	I was going to be called Isabella but my dad thought it was "too fancy." It just so happens to be one of my favourites and one of the most common names this century so far now. They were also considering Brianna, Clara, or Kaila. I think they chose Claire because my mother thought it was a "gentle" kind of name. I don't have kids yet.|`|MIgxkmIqaa	My name is Katherine Elizabeth. My mom loved the classic names so she picked Katherine and my mothers moms name is Elizabeth. Therefore I am Katherine Elizabeth.  My daughters name is Madelyn Elizabeth Ann. I love the name Maddy and Elizabeth Ann is my grandmas full name. She died when I was 10 and I wanted to honor her.  My sons name is Matthew Anthony. Matthew is after my uncle who dies in the Rhode Island station club fire and Anthony is my husbands middle name and his fathers middle name (who died) and his fathers middle name.....|`|247S9vMgaa	Abigail Eleanor    my dad is a history professor at the local university so i was named after two different first ladies.    abigail adams     &     eleanor roosevelt    i don't think they flow but they are both strong women|`|Qh0ZSXUQaa	My parents got "Shelby" from my Papaw and they got "Renee" from my mothers middle name :D|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	Mine is Robyn Elizabeth.  My mum knew she wanted to call me that sinse she was 12, she read a book and saw the name... Would have been spelt with an 'i' if i had been a boy lol.    Elizabeth was my grans first name :)|`|hXoUFWL1aa	My mom told my at the time 6 yr old sister she could name me. She chose Kelly after her best friend in kindergarten. There is no meaning behind my son's name I just love it.|`|Ryiy5sbZaa	My name is Tabitha Elaine.  Yes, I was named after Bewitched, but it's okay because I like my first name.  My middle name is after my Aunt Elaine.|`|U6v1C0Wzaa	Amy Ellen, my mother chose the first name from off a soap opra and the middle is her middle name (her aunt's name)|`|zAKFuGGiaa	Well, my parents had two names picked out for me, either Piper Marie or Savanna Marie. Savanna was their first choice but my father's family didn't like it (the next year my father's sister had a daughter and she and her husband named her Savanna Leigh... LOL) As for Piper, I don't know why my parents changed their minds, because I'd rather be Piper than Brittney... My middle name is after my mom's older sister.    My daughter's name is Kennedy Addison Grace McNamara. I loved both Kennedy and Addison and didn't want to chose just one, so we went with both, and then my boyfriend really wanter her middle name to be Grace after his grandmother who passed away six months before she was born, so we decided on the two middle names!|`|67QVKHQ3aa	well my name was supposed to be brandi or amelia but 2 days before my mother went into labor she was wathcing a soap opera and heard the name brittany so she changed her mind...CURSE that soap opera!!      i choose the name for my son bekuz my BF is jamaican and the name XXavier is jamaican..and i always LOVED that name..|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Ugh... my parents named me after a Statler Brothers song    I was actually in the doctor's office when I thought about the name for my son. I heard all of these parents yelling at their kids and I wondered if I had a little hellion running around what would I be yelling? I've always liked 'A' names so when I came across the name Aedan, it just sounded right.|`|vue9NOhYaa	My real name is a Biblical name.  My parents wanted to give all her kids names from the Bible. (I"m Jewish, and my mom wanted names that would be the same in both Hebrew and English, to avoid the common situation of a child being named, say, Miriam in Hebrew and Miranda in English. (Names that have nothig in common but the first letter)    My daughter's name is NOT Biblical, (and her Hebrew name, is different)  but it is a name that goes with my  ethnic background, and is one that hubby and I both liked. (And is fairly easy to spell and very easy to pronounce, so no issues there.)|`|SCY0bOr5aa	My name is Richelle Ann. I was named after my Dad, Richard. Its the female version. My Hubby is also Richard. So our names are the same. Ann was my Aunt.    For my kids all the middle name are family names. My Husband wanted all "B" names after Brandon was born.    Brandon Richard (Grandpa & Daddy)  Brenna Mae (Great Grandma)  Benjamin Jerome (FIL passed away in 2005)|`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	My mom named me Kylie because she liked the name Kyle. She regretted not naming my brother that, so instead, she named me Kylie.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	My name is Tom and my twin brother is Yarden. My mom had students with these names
cfdooGylaa	No it doesn't!! How to you expect to have an enjoyable pregnancy if you worry about something like this? You'll have days when you feel like crap and days when you don't. Thats how pregnacy is. Good luck and congrats!|`|Hhifw93laa	NO!!!!! morning sickness comes and goes one say you will have it and you might not have it for 2 weeks then bam 4 weeks of being sick or you may never have it again its a funny thing but your ok and so is the baby God bless|`|wl7tlYOYaa	I know how you feel when this happened to me I freaked and I was sure something was wrong with the baby the next day I went in for a sonogram and boom the baby was fine. Morning sickness can come and g...every pregnancy is different some days I'll feel a lil sick other days am pretty good. Its normal so try to relax. If you dont have any severe cramping or heavy bleeding you are okay.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	No, It might mean you are getting a break or you might be done with morning sickness.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	It's normal to have days without morning sickness. It could have stopped for today depending on what you ate.  If your to worried call your doctors office.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	No, the only sign you need to be scared about is heavy bleeding. Symptoms will come and go, but they don't mean that anything is wrong. You need to calm down though because you don't want to be stressed and cause your baby any stress.|`|Id4PlUpaaa	GO SEE A DOCTUR! Dx|`|g5xnXkQkaa	No not really maybe your having a good day today!! Enjoy it|`|iq5uwobOaa	does not mean your going to miscarry.     Just relax and really try not to focus on the bad things but rather all the wonderful things that come with being pregnant and having a baby.    It is normal to have some good days in the first few months.  Just wait till you hit your second tri and you wonder if your still pregnant.    I love having all my energy back and able to look at food and be like, oh yeah all mine.    I have to tell my husband hey, don't eat all that, save some for me.      and to let you know, if your going to miscarry their is nothing you can do to stop it.|`|tcU1Xnftaa	No, morning sickness doesn't last the entire pregnancy. Enjoy the rest of the time.
LQKW39SEaa	hun  it's your baby you don't have to look for approval from anyone  just name the baby what you want    (Great names by the way)|`|Hhifw93laa	i like them both there very strong names God bless|`|EIgmm8ilaa	Both are great!!  I'd think about sticking to Michael Anthony, it's somewhat common to be called by the middle name but I think teachers and such may be a bit confused as they usually only see an initial.|`|yNxYYHszaa	Elisha Nicole is beautiful and I think it's cool how it has some of your name. Michael Anthony Jacob is very cute but a little confusing lol.|`|URO3gDXcaa	no|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Elisha Nicole is cute.  My issue lies with the boy name.  I truly despise when parents give a kid a name and don't call him by the first name.  I have two nephews like that and it drives me absolutely insane!  Plus, his name will always be called out "Michael" in school, at work, on documents, etc.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I don't like it.    A girl i know at school was named Elisha, and everyone called her 'leesh' which i think is a pretty sucky nickname.    If you're going to call him Jacob, why not have that as his first name? That's weird. He's always going to have to correct people...|`|Qh0ZSXUQaa	Those are really cute! :D|`|9CAXUgOZaa	Yeah, they're pretty cute.    But you should really consider making the boys name Jacob Michael Anthony. It'll just be confusing and annoying for him when he starts school and has to correct people.   I went by my middle name and it was such a pain correcting all the teachers, and having to write my middle name on some stuff, and my first name on others.    And I know a lot of forms and stuff will only have room to fit one middle name, so a lot of the time they'll just leave out the Jacob, which will just seem weird to everyone, since thats what they know him as. (My friend's name was Emma Rebecca Marie S______, and on her student cards and everything, they just wrote Emma Rebecca S_____, and when she asked them to include her second middle name, they said no.    But I guess it's your choice.    Congrats x
E1ppYqCtaa	It's ok his body is now trying to recover and relax after the shock the sv put him in. But when he is awake try to get him to eat anything with potassium, it will help rebuild the lining of the stomach and the intestines and get lots of fluids in him. Just let him sleep and let his little body recuperate. My little brother went through the same thing. now if a week from now he is still doing this then take him to be checked.|`|ekAH05qWaa	i think that is great. he is making up for the sleep he lost. he needs to sleep a lot to fully recover!|`|o8xNTVWTaa	if he didn't get much sleep while he was very ill then yes.... if he still has a bit of the bug then naturally hes still going to be very tired hes trying to catch up on rest and sleeping more bc hes still sick   enjoy all this sleep while u can lol   good luck|`|5yZxxeyPaa	He is probably just feeling so good...you know how good it feels to sleep when you are worn out!  Give him a kiss and let him sleep!!!|`|wX5xoAN8aa	That sounds quite normal.  Most people sleep a lot right after sickness, to "make up" for the sleep they lost while being sick.  So because he is so young and needs more sleep than older children, it sounds normal.    Hope this helps :)|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	hes just catching up and getting better. It takes alot out of you to be that sick... if it continues for weeks then I would have it checked out, for now let him sleep it should change soon|`|ReH5EoR0aa	Yes it is a good thing.   His body is repairing itself.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	absolutely. It won't last long, so enjoy it, and take a nap too!|`|DKqsFGymaa	I'd say it's okay for the next couple of days to give his body a chance to recouperate.    If he continues that type of schedule, I would consult your family physician.|`|dv1n6lTmaa	He sounds like a growing boy. I don't think there is anything to worry about. His body is getting back his energy that he has lost.    When my son was hitting growth spurts he seem to sleep his live away. Now he is 5 goes to bed between 7-8 and wakes when the sun comes up. Instead of sleeping more during spurts he eats more.    No worries get some sleep while he gets his.
fZGcufB7aa	I think Logan Alexander is an amazing name, but since David is a name that is in your family then you probably should go with that. But I think Logan Alexander is better sounding.    I absolutely love the name Savannah! I think the best middle name for it is Rose. Savannah Chase sounds great too as a first and last name. I do prefer Sophia to Savannah though. I think Sophia Noelle is pretty.       I think all of the names are really cute. Here are some more middle names for each one:  Logan Benjamin  Logan Michael  Logan Joshua  Logan Henry  Logan Daniel    Savannah Rae  Savannah Jasmine  Savannah Claire  Savannah Mae  Savannah Christine    Sophia Belle  Sophia Lynn  Sophia Victoria  Sophia Alexis  Sophia Elizabeth      Hope This Helps!!|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I prefer Logan Alexander. But i don't like the name Logan. How about Alexander Logan?    I like the name Savannah.    Savannah Rose Chase  Savannah Taylor Chase  Savannah Noelle Chase    Hard to think of a middle name though :/    Edit: I prefer the name Sophia! ?|`|YseGAHIfaa	Logan Alexander definitely    Savannah Louise  Savannah Sophia  Savannah Eleanor  Savannah Patrice    I hope these have helped! x|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Logan Alexander and Savannah Claire/Savannah Paige|`|cwFOKMBBaa	I like Logan Alexander Chase, Ithink it flows better.

I think that you should go with Savannah E'leese Chase and not Savannah Sophia Chase that's just my thought on it though:)|`|8fb999a478a9b58248674beee489fb2eaa	I like Logan Alexander...sounds very strong.

Congrats|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I think Logan David Chase is great, I love honouring family in the newest member.  Logan Alexander flows well, but David would have to be my vote.    Savannah Bailey Chase,  Savannah Danielle Chase,  Savannah Hadley or Henley Chase,  Savannah Morgan Chase,|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I like Logan David Chase  That would be my choice, your mom will like it    Logan Alexander Chase, I do not like it as well as David    Savannah Alexis chase  Savannah Danielle Chase  Savannah Morrigan Chase  Savannah Elizabeth Chase  Savannah Rose Chase|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Logan Alexander has a nice ring to it :)    Savannah Nicole Chase, Savannah Victoria Chase, etc.  It's an adorable name :)|`|h57t7FAjaa	I think Logan Alexander flows beautifully, & its a nice name!    mn suggestions for Savannah:  Savannah Lynn Chase (I like the alliteration of the nn)  Savannah Leigh Chase  Savannah Noelle  Savannah Rowan  Savannah Nicole  Savannah Brynn  Savannah Elyse  Savannah Shea    Hope this helps :)|`|7uy8iy7laa	Logan Alexander is adorable! :)     I like Savannah Chase.

vue9NOhYaa	It may make a slight difference.  "They" do recommend trying every other day rather than every day to allow the sperm time to build back up again.  But for most couples it makes no difference.  There are plenty of sperm in each ejaculate, even if you release some every day.|`|BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|AA11277205	My husband and I are trying to conceive and I am becoming quite an expert on the subject! :) As far as I have read, if she is at her fertile time, the more you do your business without her, the worse it can be for conception. Try the "sperm meets the egg" plan.    Predict when she ovulates either by buying a kit or her taking her temp, or checking her cervical mucous. Have sex on her cycle day 8, 10 and 12 then every day on the 13, 14, and 15th days. This should do the trick!    Good luck!!!! :)
hPuS6cxAaa	I used to be on Microgynon, I was very naughty and sometimes didn't have a break, and this meant my periods didn't come.   I went on Depo Provera which stopped mine, but I don't recommend that because once you have the injection, all the side effects are with you for 3 months!  I'm going to try Cerazette afterwards which is a POP, which you take all the time.    If you don't take a break from your combined pill then your period will not come, or come randomly after a while.   As for your mother, just talk to her, she's had to live through periods too, she knows how awful they are. That's what mums are for!|`|zhk8o514aa	No it won't stop but your cramps will be a lot better though. If you really want to stop your periods consider taking the Depo Provera (its a shot) and within a few months they MAY stop.|`|se4W82zbaa	Nope, all the pill will do is regulate your period (i.e., you'll be able to predict better when it will arrive).    Why do you want to stop your period? Permanently or just wanting to skip this next period?     I know that there are pills available to postpone your period for special occasions, such as going on holiday. However, those are only for use on the odd occasion; you'd need a doctor's prescription, and your doctor would probably think you are too young.|`|ZYr66mvhaa	you dont want your periods to stop honey, this is your bodys way of telling you that everything is working ok. I take the pill femulin which i dont have a break in so only have periods maybe 3 times per year. I have this as I have had children tho.|`|aw0sAmVPaa	No they don't stop, it can make your periods become lighter. I sometimes carry on taking my pill on my 7 day break if I am going away or doing something special to stop me having my periods. If you want to stop your periods you would be better off going on the contraceptive injection instead, for most people it stops their periods but it does not always. Have a chat with your doctor, he/she will know best.    Hope that helps x|`|AtDlNnIBaa	some pills stop your period others dont. i am one that begins with diannte or something like that. it is mostly for my skin makes it really clear and also stops cramps.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	There are other methods of controlling cramps - without the pill !!  most often this is just a smoke screen !!  Sorry I tell it as I find.  My daughter suffers terribly and has done since day 1 at age 13.  She is on Tranexamic Acid and Metroclopromide ( the last one she can only take for 3 days out of any one month but we always hope we get the days right otherwise that is it.       Why on earth would you want periods to stop - this is the body getting rid of something that has not been fertilised so it is best out.  If you get right meds you will be fine - THE PILL is not the ONLY answer but that's probably not what you want to hear is it ?   Even with the pill you will get one week where you MUST take off so yr period arrives.  Sorry you were born a female - there are OTHER alternatives.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	there are many types of the pill. Lots of people end up finding one that suits them best!    From my experience there is one type that can stop periods with some people. That is cetalopram (i think that's the spelling)  This hormone is also used with the contraceptive implant.|`|q7662pXPaa	NEGATIVE
hTQg5tgPaa	If you plan on nursing, lactose shouldn't be a problem.  Since you are lactose intolerant than you obviously are not drinking/eating dairy from cow.  I wouldn't worry too much about the acid reflux, my mom has it and only one out of us five inherited it from her.  As long as the child is eating well and growing, I wouldn't worry too much about it unless symptoms start to appear. Worrying about it will just stress you out, which is not good for you or baby.    If it is really concerning you, talk to your physician.|`|bvYPr0Cvaa	If the baby is born with it, they will probably put the baby on a soy formula - for the lactose intolerance part anyways. My daughter was born with acid reflux, they put her on some medicine to help with it. I am also have lactose intolerance and i think my daughter inherited it, she has been on soy formula since a day or two after she was born, the regular formula caused her to spit up constantly. Now the change to cows milk is causing her to have extremely bad diarreah, so we have to take her to the doctor about it. But there is no way to tell for certain if your baby will inherit it, just have to wait and see. Best of luck!!!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Even if these problems were transferred genetically, which I'm not sure they are, successfully treating the symptoms would not prevent them from being passed to the baby.  For example, if you get a nose job, your baby still gets your old nose!|`|njLVIp55aa	Just because you have those issues doesnt really mean the baby will get them...    If however they end up with reflux there is medication you give them to help with it and even if they do get acid reflux it may not even be because mom had it...LOTS of babies have acid reflux and they out grow it as they get into thier toddler years...    But if the baby is spitting up a lot and arching thier back to show the signs simply call your doc and they will exam them and start medication to help.    As for being lactose intolerent, lots of babies have this problem too. There are lots of formulas out there(should you shoose not to BF) and working with you doc they will find what works best for your baby...    My daughter has severe reflux and takes 2 medications and she is an extremely happy baby now that its under control....    I also have Crohns disease and there is not a huge chance she is going to have it.    Keep your head up and always know that you can call your  pediatrcian prior to the child arriving and discuss this with them to ensure they are on the level you want them to be at and feel comfortable with,|`|HXfHkoSHaa	There's no definite way to tell until your baby is born.  S/he may have a higher chance of inheriting it, but then again, s/he may be fine.|`|4JgSq2rlaa	no i dont think so|`|bAp35x7uaa	Not necessarily, however reflux is extremely common in babies anyway.  So while your child might have reflux it may not be passed on, just simply one of those things which disappear after six months.    My nephew had reflux and my sister found that keeping him upright after eating, giving him infant gaviscon after a meal to keep it down and also propping up his cot so his head was higher than his legs all helped.      http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases...|`|oDVLJAqUaa	dont stress that type of thing isnt really stuff babies inherit..and if he is born with problems with lactose intolerance they have special formula and if he/she has acid reflux they have special formulas and medicine neither problem are life threatening
a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	We are currently working on training my fiance's daughter who is 2 years, 7 months old.  She wears Pull-Ups when we go out and cotton training panties when she is home.    She used to be incredibly dependent on the sippy cup and carried one everywhere.  Now for meals, I give her a small child's cup with no lid on it.  She likes using the same type of cup as her 11 year old sister uses.  I fill it with a few ounces at a time and refill it when needed.      Also, we've limited the sippy cup to stay only in the kitchen.  She can leave it on the counter and get a drink any time, but it MUST stay there.  It has really managed to move along the potty training process since she is not just randomly drinking all day long.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Well my 2 year old still has her sippy cup. But she also uses it as a comfort item when she sleeps, so its quite hard right now to take it away from her. But that isn't my main concern.     My daughter isn't fully potty trained but she does go on her own and has done both in the potty. I haven't done much potty training with her, but i honestly think she learned it herself because i always bring her in the bathroom with me. I don't dare leave her alone in the living room alone, not even for a minute, while i'm in the bathroom .lol. She doesn't go all the time, but she does go on her own when she does.     Maybe you just want to try bringing your daughter in with you all the time. When you go, have her sit on the potty. And make sure, when she finally does pee or poo, give her some smarties, candy, whatever for going.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My daughter is 4 and was potty trained day and night by the time she was 28 months. She had gotten off the sippy cup at 3. At dinner time she would use a regular cup. [when she was 2 1/2 years old]|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	Mine daughter was around 2 and half when off day diapers, but not trained until 3 for night.  As far as the sippy cup, I'm kind of a anal person and did not want my daughter running around the house without a sippy so she had hers longer then 3..I know call me weird.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My son was out of diapers at 21 months old, and my daughter was out of diapers at 19 months.  They are now 33 months (son) and 21 months (daughter) and they both still use their sippy cups.  My son would probably get off of his, as he does drink from regular cups and from straws, but we use the sippy cups a lot in the house right now for less mess.      I'd pick which one is more important to you (I would suggest potty training), and do them one at a time, so it isn't as big of an adjustment for her.  For potty training, just put her in underwear and plan on staying home for a few days!  That is what we did and the kids each potty trained in less than 48 hours!  They eventually got sick of that wet feeling and how long it took to change their clothes and clean up after.  We let them pick out their own underwear too. That helped.      Then as for the cups.... I guess you gotta just go cold turkey and throw them away.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	Both of my kids trained at 24 months. I finished off their last package of diapers, then didn't buy anymore. My son only had one accident before he realized the potty was the best option. My daughter took about a week, but doesn't have accidents anymore, and she's 3. If you don't have a diaper to fall back on, it makes things so much easier. Then you HAVE to do it, so your kid feels the consistency and determination. Consistency is key. It's hard to not give in with cleaning up all those messes, and the kid whining, but it's OH SO WORTH IT to not have to change a 2 yr olds poopy diapers.  My 3 year old still uses her sippy cup at meal time, but that's it. I think we'll get rid of it soon. My son (5) was done with sippy by 3. He just wasn't that into it anyhow.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My daughter is 18 months old and we are potty-training and teaching her to drink from a regular cup. She's gone potty in her big girl potty and has drank from a cup on her own, but not always|`|FORX7yfQaa	My boy was 9 years old before he first used ma toilet.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	My daughter was 25 months when she was done potty training.  I like the sippy cup.  I put her milk or juice in it everyday.  Less spills.  She's not attached to it.  She's 33 months now.|`|JjBtgSixaa	They learn in time.  Try pullups so she can feel like a big girl.  It'll happen, be patient and good luck.|`|ZYEIsoDDaa	my mum potty trained us from 6weeks old...    when it looked like we were doing a poo shed hold us over the toilet, that way we didnt get used to the feeling of poo in our pants and hate it and then want to use the potty and toilet at a younge age..    plus my sister is 7 and she still used pull ups at nigh.|`|DKqsFGymaa	Kids should potty train between the ages of two or three.  With today's diapers keeping them so dry, it tends to be closer to the age of three.    I transition daycare kids from a sippy cup to a real cup at around the age of 2-1/2.|`|nFzqGWBDaa	my 3 yr old was 13 months when she got out of diapers. i used to ask her if she had 2 use the bathroom or sometimes i would take her w/ me. far as the sippy cup she threw it away at 10 months. but all babies learn at different ages.|`|dv1n6lTmaa	Some children resist because they feel they are being pushed into something. As a parent somethings seem they will take forever, however it will come to pass.    Try cute cups with straws, this might help the transition. My son wanted to do everything his dad and big brother did so potty and moving into regular cups was easy.    Good luck and be patient.|`|m40CSYgGaa	My oldest stopped wearing diapers when she was 18 months old and as far as the sippy cup goes every child is different. Stop giving your child a sippy when you think they can drink out of a normal cup without spilling their drink.
KHZLPldraa	My 17 month old does this as well.  Our pediatrician said that if she is not willing to drink water then she must be truly hungry.  I don't know how much truth there is to that theory, but she will scream for hours and hours until she gets milk, so we now have a mini frig so we can just give it to her right away and get back to sleep.  May not be the ideal solution but it so far has worked, better than the screaming fest for three hours.|`|rLsphyqhaa	She is almost two and becoming head strong. I would try if she like strawberry or some other flavor mix it up and give it to her during the day see if she likes it. this way she drinks her milk during the day instead so late at night. Our grandson like milk at night well during the day also. his mother would not give him any at bedtime. But if he would drink a glass and brush his teeth he went right to bed and sleeps. His mother does not like that much but we got his mother up and out, nothing wrong with milk at all unless it came from China then I would be a little concerned.|`|V6vAvs0Yaa	Girls always seem to get into hard to break routines. My daughter was similar, except that her vice was sleeping in our bed. Religiously.     Try a few different things.     1. Change her daily routine. Try putting her to bed earlier, and waking her up earlier.     2. Stick with the plan. Explain to her no more milk after bed time. You WILL have a few rough nights, but the storm will always pass. You are more resilient than your child.|`|zX4nU1Rtaa	http://parenting.ivillage.com/tp/tpdevel...      here is the ivillage website u can actually get on here and find out how to break bad habits...this is however a bad habit..u arent getting the sleep u need and neither is she..my suggestion is that u decide there is not any drinking after bed and stick with it...u have to learn to become more assertive than ur 21 month old...stop letting her guilt u into drinking milk..u will need to let her cry it out itll be rough but shell get over it
Qe9FmH8raa	I like Mallon Christopher very much.  When I first heard 'Mallon' I didn't like it, but having said it a bunch of times now it brings to mind an honest, strong, succesful man. I love the way it honors your mother as well.   Other suggestions:  Mallon Andrew  Mallon John  Mallon David  Mallon Samuel  Mallon Charles  Good Luck with your son!|`|9CAXUgOZaa	Sorry to hear about your mother.     I think the middle name depends on your last name.     Mallon Sean would work if the last name was long, and Mallon Elijah would sound good with a one-two syllable last name.     I think Mallon Christopher sounds the best, though. And Christopher usually goes well with most names.    Congrats x|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	I love Elijah Mallon!    also like  Quinn Mallon|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I think it's great to honour your mother, but I would consider Mallon being the middle name.  Kids can be so cruel these days, just consider.    Elijah Mallon is great, I've always loved Elijah.  Sean would be my second choice.  I don't really care for Christopher, it's so overused.    Other possible suggestions:    Andrew Mallon/Mallon Andrew,  Bryce Mallon/Mallon Bryce,  Jeremy Mallon/Mallon Jeremy,  Jared Mallon/Mallon Jared,  Lucus Mallon/Mallon Lucus,  Paul Mallon/Mallon Paul,  Tyler Mallon/Mallon Tyler|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	All three sound good but my favourite is Mallon Christopher.    Naming him Mallon is a lovely way to honour your mother.    Good luck!|`|yNxYYHszaa	Mallon Elijah is my favorite. It's a great name.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	If you flipped the names around and put Mallon as the mn, it would flow so much better and it is still a great honor for your mom :)|`|olF9Hl6saa	I think you should you Mallon as a middle name. It still would be a wonderful way of honoring your mother.     Christopher Mallon  Elijah Mallon (my fav)  Sean Mallon    I like the names Keegan, Brendan, Carter,  & Dominick for a boy.|`|IvkNTqDMaa	My opinion...you should make Mallon the middle name.|`|YseGAHIfaa	Mallon Elijah - I LOVE THIS NAME..!!    Lots of Luck  =)   x|`|XV4iPwtJaa	Mallon Elijah, in my opinion, is the best... more unique. nice way to honour your mother, i think its great to be named after a family member :)|`|l6bUdWlqaa	Mallon Elijah =  i like this name better then the other two|`|MIgxkmIqaa	I think this name is great because its different! I like Mallon Christopher the best! Congrats!
ZbnxGIsnaa	You shouldn't be lifting anything heavier then 20 pounds dear.  It can cause a miscarriage and we don't want that!  =(|`|wl7tlYOYaa	No when ur pregnant your not supposed to do any heavy lifting because it may cause harm to the baby and you can have a miscarriage. I would stir clear of that and get someone to help you. you really dont want to risk your pregnancy. I actually wanted to go horseback riding but am 12 weeks so thats not going to happen lol Good luck|`|NaYb4CnGaa	ask ur doc. my doc said it would be fine to lift heavy things if i was used to doing it before i got pregnant but not to strain. just to be on the safe side ask your doc.|`|jzdhqxPTaa	No heavy lifting whilst pregnant. Can cause miscarriage.  I would split the weight, I know it will take longer to complete the feeding ect ect. But its better to be safe then sorry. Can you afford to hire help?   Are you riding? Its very important that your not. Not becaue of risk of falling off. But all the jiggling and jumping can also cause you to miscarry.  Sorry to sound all negative and gloomy!  Congrats and good luck.|`|8mchLCQhaa	No my doctor told me not to lift anything over 20. I would ask your doctor just to see what they say.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	No, your placenta can tear away and you can miscarry.
ZbnxGIsnaa	I love cats too and that would disturb me, BIG TIME.  I think I would unfortunately throw up probably.  XD|`|Hu9yquP4aa	You mean there isn't a dead cat category? Or one to make someone sick while they are eating their breakfast?|`|YrK7S8xtaa	because they are sick twisted individuals, i cant see any other reason for it|`|rh12tX8Naa	It was probably some kids who think it would be funny to gross somebody out. I agree with you, it's disgusting and disturbing and unsanitary.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	I'm with you hun, I'm a huge animal person and that would upset me terribly. It is sick that anyone would do that. They obviously have some issues themselves. Normal people don't do that.|`|Z7dKEJcgaa	That's just horrible.  I love cats, my little kitty is snuggled into my pregnant tummy as we speak!  I sometimes can't get over the cruelty we still see towards animals, it can be hugely upsetting.  Anyway, you have to take care of your precious cargo lady so don't let it upset you too much x|`|ZErpLwQUaa	ok?...|`|iq5uwobOaa	the reason is unknown why someone would stick a dead cat in the mailbox.  maybe it was a person that did not like the person.  Maybe it was some stupid teens bored.    it would bother me to.|`|Bo3M090Xaa	wow, thats so messed up..and i'm not really an 'animal lover' but i would never even think of doing something like that ever!|`|tcU1Xnftaa	That is a tasteless joke. Probably some ignorant teens.|`|fYMWDQLGaa	someone who doesnt like atleast one of member of tht house should have done that.. trying to scare or joke.. whatever they thought,,    but you should not think abt that as ur  pregannt... happy 9 months..|`|AA10187097	That is just sick.|`|2cstdEkIaa	personal vendetta?|`|KTGSXjvfaa	Maybe because they r sick in the head, did that ever occur to you, there sure are some nasty people in this  world|`|uYukJagsaa	a cruel practical joke!!!|`|yZ21oCuSaa	lmao. good one. those kids know how to creep people out.
MxhNzW7Oaa	Good luck hunni! I'm keeping my fingers crossed!    My first reaction to my oldest being born was a laugh. After the cord was cut & the doctor held him up, he peed on the doctor! LMAO. Then I heard him cry as they got him cleaned up and I cried. Then my husband brought him over to be to see. I had complications after he was born so I only got to see him for like less than 5 minutes. Seeing his face for the first time was amazing. I couldn't believe how beautiful he was!    When my second was born, my first thought with him was "he's so small, I hope he's okay". I was so scared as I was only 32 weeks. But then I heard him cry and somehow with that cry, I knew everything was going to be just fine. I told my husband to go get a picture of him (as the NICU was stablizing him and they couldn't bring him over). So I got to see him first as a picture. I couldn't believe how small he was. I kept yelling, "how much does he weigh!!??" They finally brought him over to me after they had him all ready to go in the transporter thing (he was being transferred to another hospital). I swear I called the NICU 100 times for the rest of the day & night. Left the hospital the next morning and went straight to see him. I was scared to hold him at first, I didn't want to break him! He is amazing though. Such a trooper, looked just like his big brother.    *sigh* memories....I hope you make lots of good memories with your little one! You won't ever forget them :)    ETA: Sorry I rambled a bit. BEST OF LUCK xoxox!|`|TQW5E6olaa	Goodluck!    Oh my gosh, she's so beautiful!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I'm waiting on an update!    **fingers crossed**    I was so drugged up when I first saw his face that all I could do was look at him.  I even changed his name when I saw his face.  I had decided on Jacob Michael.  I saw him, looked at my mom and said "He's a Johnny".|`|AkFag8tNaa	Good luck! I laughed and cried.....very weird emotions;)|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I'm going to be so jealous if you get to go first!! =) Only kidding!    Good luck and congratulations, keep us updated!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	goodness you still haven't had that baby?*fingers crossed*     the first time i saw my son i was exhausted but very happy. i was scared i was going to drop him because i was so tired and shaky|`|pVWk12oOaa	Fingers crossed for you!!! :)    It was surreal...  I cried (of course!)  All I remember is saying over and over "he's just so perfect!" haha We didn't know the sex, we hearing the words "it's a boy" was so exciting!!   The skin to skin contact within the first minutes of his birth is a feeling I'll never forgot!  Oh and then he peed on my.. haha  yup, he was about 5 minutes old, naked, laying on my bare chest/tummy and he peed!    Good luck!!!|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Good luck sweetie and forget about the laundry !!! When I first saw my children's face, I puked both times since I had a C-section and I felt sick due to the effects of the anesthesia !|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	good luck sweetie... fingers are crossed!!!    The first time I saw Jacob's face I was in awe at how tiny and perfect he was. Not bragging at all but many many people in and out of my family tell me how perfect and how beautiful he looked right after birth and that it is rare. I pushed forever and he didn't even have a cone head all the bad. Oh.. he was so precious.... he's grown so much in 8 months...     Cherish the days that he's tiny...they go so fast!|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I have absolutely been in awe with all three of my children.  I cried my eyes out every time I looked at their little faces.  My oldest son is 10 and I am still amazed that I could make something so beautiful.  Rest now while you can.  Congratulations and good luck!  I want to see lots of pictures!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	My fingers are crossed for you.     I don't know what it's like to see your baby's face for the first time, but I can tell you I cry like a baby every time I watch one of the shows on TLC, Bringing Home Baby or a Baby Story!|`|e4aF8tdPaa	i will keep my fingers crossed. when i saw Lamar i cried. i had a c section so all i could really do was lay there and wait to hear a cry. once i heard him cry and saw his face i was happy but at the same time it hit me oh sh!t im a mom lol. it was the best thing ever. good luck and keep me posted!!!!! :-)|`|wKYdIaZVaa	:::Crosses fingers::: GOOD LUCK!!!    I was so drugged when I saw Chloe for the first time. (emergency c-section) that all I said was "she's so small" and cried. Its about the only thing I remember in the first 24 hours after she was born.     Best of luck to you! May you have a fast and easy delivery!|`|vKYdV5r2aa	I got my fingers crossed my toes crossed and my arms crossed ,but i don't think i can keep this up until MONDAY !!!!!!  Best of luck . and keep us all posted .|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Run up and down those stairs a few more times. Get that baby moving!! Best of luck to you.    The first time you see your child's face is awesome. Their is no word to describe it.     Keep us posted!!|`|bvYPr0Cvaa	It is love at first sight, the first time you see their little faces. Congrats, and Good Luck!!!|`|upk9TNWsaa	fingers crossed... The first time I saw my babys face I was taken back from how beautiful she was. I couldn't believe what an angel she was. I was speechless.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	*fingers crossed*    Keep up updated! I am so excited for you,  it is just so surreal when you see your babies face, I was in so much pain still because I didnt have time to get any drugs so they were just trying to fix me up but after that was all done I just couldnt believe that my lil man was out of me. I cried and cried (happy tears).|`|AA11476782	Yes, I hope for you and Jamie that everything is okay.    I felt relieved, excited, overjoyed, exhausted, elated, and so many other emotions all at once.  It's indescribable, really.    http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t42/j...  This was taken as I got my first good look at my baby--I was crying and smiling at the same time.  (Don't mind that I look horrible.  This was after over 30 hours of labor and then an emergency c-section!) It was an amazing moment in time and I still could cry just thinking about it!|`|eF6HTt0gaa	I cried and felt a rush of happy emotion thats still kinda hard to explaine. Congrats, best wishes and Ive lit an honor candel to welcome him/her to the world. Blessings to you all      May you always walk in sunshine.  May you never want for more.  May Irish angels rest their wings   beside your nursery door.  And for the proud parents:   May God grant you  a wee bit of heaven  to cradle in your arms -  a sweet bonny baby   to hold close to your heart  A newborn babe  brings light to the house  warmth to the hearth  and joy to the soul  for wealth is family  family is wealth.  Old irish proverb|`|MsipL0Mzaa	my fingers are crossed!!....let us know!!!..i cant wait for my day either!!...when you see his face it will be the most amazing moment ever...to look at this little being and know you created him and "grew" him,you wont be able to get enough of hm!! ...gooodluck...praying for both of you...|`|p61Ccuvyaa	i had 4 babies 9, 5, 3, and 7 months.. i was so releved the pain was over with.. of course i cried.. it is so awesome... you have to experience it..
vue9NOhYaa	Hormonal birth control does work the same.  Other methods may not. (The sponge, for example as a high failure rate in women who have had children, and the IUD is rarely usable for women who have NOT had children.)|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Regardless if you have children or not birthcontrol is still pretty much the same. I've been on various pills and the patch. The patch I didnt really like because it would start peeling on the edges and getting lint and I would be paranoid it wasnt working plus the risk of a blood clot from them are much higher than with a birth control pill.|`|Hhifw93laa	yeah birth Control works no matter how meny kids you have its still not 100% though.
ZadTQtJaaa	Yes, I look at my parents differently... HOWEVER sometimes my mother's advice sometimes isn't always welcome. :-)|`|AA11210211	In some ways yes I do but me and my mom were totally different at this age even as parents and we decided to live different lifestyles but in some ways I do see where she is coming from.|`|4gZYucHMaa	Actually since I've had kids is the reason I don't talk to my parents--I'm from an abusive family and since having kids I have no idea how some people could do that to their kids--having kids woke me up.|`|AA12127693	Yes, because I realized that they "did know" what they were talking about way back when!|`|fEF2WoaYaa	Yes I do understand some of the things but most I know what not to do with my kids|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Yes, since I have become a mother I have been more appreciative of my parents.
rgA4jIsyaa	hahaha, i have a son, and have been a single mom since his dad died when he was 3. I'm glad i have a son because girls his age are an emotional mess. its not hard. My kid plays every sport known to man and is very respectful towards girls and women|`|GnXfEdegaa	I've heard from so many women that boys are so... much easier to raise.  The hormones don't get in the way as much.  I don't know for sure cuz I have a 10 yo only child (girl) and she has always acted like a "rough and tumble boy", liking mostly boys clothes and toys and I would love her to dress like a girl and be interested "girl things".  Still hoping.|`|ZejwYamhaa	I think both boys and girls are difficult but in different ways.   Boys tend to break the rules more where as girls tend to be emotional and have more problems|`|t9qXQI19aa	I only have daughters and they're (usually) pretty ok.    My dad insists my brothers were easier.    Mom always disagreed.    I think whatever your gender is will be the easiest for you.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	I have two daughters and a son and I wouldn't say that it is harder fo either of them but it is very different.    My daughters and I share a bond and do shopping together, cooking and so much more, my son and I have a bond and play video games together or build models.  I can talk to all of my kid and they can talk to me.  All three kids play sports so we do that together, mom has learned to throw a football just as good as dad does!    I will say shopping for the girls is harder.  My son is happy with jeans and a t-shirt the gils will take 2 hours to pick out one outfit, then you have the make up and the hair on top of that.    As for the rest I worry about my son and his play more than with the girls.  he is the dare devil type and they were more laid back.  It is harder to entertain him on a snowy or rainy day that it is the girls that are content to sit and watch a movie or read a book.  But I worry more about the girls and something happening to them when they date or are out with friends.    When you look at it neither is harder both are, you worry about them both just in different ways.  I will say boys have more energy though.|`|a3TZ7hFTaa	I have an 11 months old son and a 7 years old step daughter. So far, I can say the boys are easier to raise :)|`|1ZnzjCdlaa	Actually I think little boys are easier. I had my daughter in 2003, and then had my little boy in 2007. He was so much more relaxed. My little girl all you could do was hold her all day long, and my little boy wanted to be down to get into everything. But as of right now I think little boys are alot easier then girls.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I think a boy and a girl both vary so much but are also very much the same. Raising a CHILD in general is no easy task. But girls might be easier at the start and be more difficult in the end. A boy might be tough at the start and easy in the end. Or the total opposite for both.     I have helped raise my stepdaughter and we have been raising our son. Both have their moments, some days are easier than others, but kids will be kids. I dont think the gender really makes all that much of a difference.|`|4gZYucHMaa	my son is far easier, is a little sweetheart, always thinking of others first    my daughter is all about what are you going to do for me, is a drama queen and only 7, I'm scared what she'll be like when hormones kick in    Both are still my litte babies tho and treated fairly!|`|aLwrpMPXaa	LOL ! I have a 7 yr old son and a 9 yr old daughter ! They are raised the same way...it's the outcome, that has a huge impact on us parents ! I think girls are more "bossy" while the boy is more "playful" and him being the second child, he is clearly more independent ! Love them both!!!|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	yes and no. I am a single mother of 3 boys and 1 girl. Sometimes I just don't understand my boys and your right, I can't be a father to them in the traditional sense of the word but I can do just about anything with them. There are times I don't even understand my daughter and she is only 6. Only time will tell. You can definitely see the generation gap between me and my kids. I try my best and hope that I raise them with proper manners, how to treat other people and to know what's right and what's wrong. Only time will tell if I did a good job or not.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	I have daughters, they are drama queens. My niece says boys are much easier than girls. I don't think you need to fill a fathers shoes when raising a son, I believe it can be done.|`|bqehqlFHaa	I have two sons and my husband has 2 daughters.  I think it's easier to raise boys..............less drama!   Girls are makeup, clothes, perfume, hair, nails & boys!!!!|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I think if you are an active parent and truly know your kids then it doesn't matter which sex they are!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I have one of each.  So far my son has been much easier than my daughter, but he's only 4 months.|`|fEF2WoaYaa	I think my son was less winey than my daughter But boys are more "dare devilish" when they get older (my son is 6 now) lil girl is two   but I think My son will be a lil easier when they grow up you know girls bring lots of drama lol And I was single till my son was 2 and half but his dad has never been there and we relate fine we have a great relationship|`|GRyFxwTbaa	I have two daughters.    So far, so good.|`|BJkfY3g4aa	I have both and really they both have their advantages and disadvantages. My poor lil guy picks up a lot of his sisters actions. But really I see things that have been easier with him (which it could be because he's the 3rd) and some things like potty training that are taking longer. I guess you take what you get and you adapt...that's the only thing I can say. My MIL had 3 boys and she said that boys are easier than girls...but how does she know? She only had boys. Oh and she doesn't get involved much with my girls...so it's not like she can count that as any kind of experience. Each child is different...My two girls are very different from each other and they all three have their own personalities. You'll figure things out as you go...promise!|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I think both are differently difficult.    I think as our society continues to go down the crapper, parents' jobs will only get harder.    It might be harder for a female to raise a male - but only because the aspects of being a strong man with integrity and values is different than being a strong woman with integrity and values.  We face different obstacles depending on our gender.    You can teach right from wrong and point him in the right direction, but it takes a man to discuss certain situations.  I agree that we can't fill both shoes.  We're either the mother or the father... we can go a long way to pushing our kids in the right direction, but what kids need are good role models - and without a father (or another good adult male) in his life, he might get lost.    Doesn't mean we give up though!  Good luck!|`|SJwRbuBHaa	Boys are so much easier by far !    they are different than us, wanting to fix things, and drive fast, roll in the mud, and build things, (on second thought, I like to do those things too)but just give him the freedom to be himself. Girls are more difficult to raise in a different way, but you're gonna have fun, congrats on your new baby:)|`|qR3MYSOIaa	Oh heck, my son (13)  is WAY easier than my daughter (15).  He's more "work" for me, because I tend to do more things for him, he's a little younger and my "baby".  But She is more "worry" (even though he's the one who's gotten stitches 5 times).      He likes to stay close to home, she hangs around people I don't always approve of.  During lunch at school, he's in a spare classroom playing DS with his friends, she's in the smoking section with hers!  I can go buy him whatever I want him to wear, and he'll wear it.  She is picky and it takes her 2 hours to pick out of a pair of shoes or jeans, meanwhile getting mad at me because the store doesn't have the name brand she wants.    I love them both, but he is easier.|`|zlQo7WMoaa	My parents told me both are difficult in different ways.|`|KXd5gc0eaa	I dont know but i can say my momas proud of her mistake which is me. I mean my mom is single and she raised me ok but i did have a cool uncle that was there so i dunno. LULZ|`|Nq7TtSVNaa	Forgive me that I answer from a lack of knowledge of even having any children but I would assume that raising a girl might be more difficult.  If you look at it from a behavioral angle, you must be very strict with your daughter and prevent her from the shame things that society will bombard her to do.  People always want to comment on how men can do anything they want and women can't but it's just the truth.  Do not let your daughters fall into this whirlpool of promiscuity and sexual seduction.  Everyone likes a scandalous woman but no one wants one as a daughter or wife.|`|fx6pNJ5saa	I have 2 sons and my sister has 2 daughters...I'm having a much easier time
wzXJOSIeaa	CONGRATS...you are pregnant. No matter what brand pregnancy test you use they are all the same thing. It's not often you get a false positive especially three times.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It's essentially the same test you used.  If you had 3 postive tests you ARE pregnant, and there's no need to get the test redone at PP. It's just  a waste of money. (Yours if you pay for it, or theirs if you are low income and get free services from them.)|`|NaYb4CnGaa	yes. and if u took 3 HTP then congrats your having a baby* its very rare to get a false positive on a HTP so its not going to give you 3. Hope everything goes well for you.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	SAME accuracy as peeing on a stick. You need bloodwork to be accurate.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It'll be the same as the ones you can buy. False positives are rare - I would say you're pregnant. If you want to know with more accuracy than a urine test, ask for a blood test.    Harriet|`|mc6YtaRbaa	They are the same as the ones you buy in the store so you will get the same result.|`|AA11801100	I have gone to Planned Parenthood and their tests were just as accurate as the one I got in the Dr's office. They all use pretty much the same test.  So good luck to you. If this is what you want then Congrats if not good luck either way.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Yes, it'll say the same as the dollar store tests.  Positive.   Hope that's what you want.
qDLT1eh6aa	Both really.  We depend on my salary, the mortgage comes out of my account and gas/electric.  I enjoy work though, I breeze through it, I see friends there, I find it easy to manage the amount of hours, and the job itself.  I only do 23 hours a week though, the full 35 the others do would be a bit too much with 2 kids I think.  Theres no point paying out too much on childcare ~ a good balance is just right.|`|ZYouNFQbaa	I worked when I had my children for financial reasons, i worked nights 3 nights a week so I still had a lot if time with them. Since they were 4 and 6, they are now 6 and 8, I work because I choose to, I was home for 6 months due to redundancy and it drove me mad being home but we realised that financially I didn't need to work. I work 13 hours a week at my local supermarket as it is the only social contact i get. I love my husband and my children but i need more than to be just a wife and mother.|`|ZejwYamhaa	When my kids were younger I stayed home and looked after them but when they went to school I found myself having too much time to myself so I went back to work. I work because I choose to and I love my job!|`|QCVzUC1baa	Im also on maternity but due to back in 6 weeks when my son will be 5.5 months.  Im Absolutely dreading  it but have no choice. I am only going back 4 days week but the thought of leaving my boy is killing me :-(|`|fdnbXfvfaa	A bit of both.  I work to help give us a better life, and I work because I like to get out of the house and be earning my own money, so I don't have to ask my husband for anything.  Plus my daughter is not my husbands bio child, and I like to think I don't have to depend on his money to take care of her.  Don't get me wrong he provides for her, and loves her as his own, but I like to make sure that I can still provide for her myself|`|8wnvhBQTaa	I am also on maternity leave and due to go back to work soon but finacially the childcare costs more than I earn so I will have to leave but will be looking for a part time job when my husband is home to look after the baby's. I will need to work part time job to pay the bills.|`|U3jS5k9eaa	My little boy is 10 months, i work only for finanicial reasons.Hubby and i both work night shifts, when we get home i sleep for a few hrs then its his turn. He sleeps at granny and grandads 2 nights a week, i would not trust anyone else, i get to bath him and put him to bed every night and i do not feel as though im missing out on him. I feel im lucky enough to have the best of both worlds, i would definitely stay at home if it was an option but unfortunately its not :(|`|JTI2Pmkaaa	both (or that's my intention... I'm only sixteen years so far..)|`|zaMTz8z5aa	My mum works for financial reasons and she hates not being there for us at school things and not talking to us enough. But my dad is very sick and can't work at all so she has to do it. When dad is back at work she will go back to part time work and we will all be happier.  But it's kinda nice having dad around so much more and he does stuff different from mum and sometimes that's good...sometimes it's not good too!! LOL!!|`|tcU1Xnftaa	One of the hardest things for a mom to do is leave her children with a daycare everyday. So I'm sure they work for financial reasons.|`|TrN99meFaa	I have to work as my sons dad died when my son was 3 years old so i'm the only person who can support us financially.    I went back to full time work when my son was 5 months old.    I choose to work because i worked hard to get my career, almost 10 years at university.     Yes there are times when i've spent 12 hours a day away from my child, yes there have been times when i've cried with guilt but i believe working parents set great examples to children and we CAN have it all and balance it well.|`|N1IQuM1jaa	I too am on maternity leave, and only wish i could stay at with my baby!  I am about to be made redundant, so i am now job-hunting as well - talk about tainting the most precious few months i will have with my little one!!  Unfortunately both myself and my husband need to work to pay the bills!  Always thought i would be happy to go back to work, couldn't see myself being a stay-at-home mum, but now its come to it, i would give anything to stay with her!|`|4v90WyUhaa	I work part time for financial reasons. We don't have to pay a sitter so part time worked for us better financially than full time. I spend time with our youngest during the day and my husband takes care of him during the evening. When our youngest goes to school I'll probably quit and go back to school though. I work to pay our dish bill and my internet but my husband pays everything else.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	i need to work for financial reasons, but ill be honest as much as i think i want to be a sahm i really dont know if i could. i enjoy my interaction with my coworkers and i enjoy having a little money in my pocket so that i can buy my daughter a new book or shoes without blowing the budget.|`|naySyzfQaa	I work for financial reasons definitely! My daughter is in school and my mom takes excellent care of her while I'm away. A mom's gotta do what a mom's gotta do.|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	self employed, part-time by choice, live within our means, some other moms envious but aren't willing to sacrifice material things.  best choice for us.|`|9kPPmazoaa	I am on maternity leave right now (unpaid maternity leave). And was actually supposed to return back to work next week. But I postponed for another week. Because I just started my daughter on new formula & acid reflux medicine and want to see how she does with it before returning to work. She will be almost 3 months when I return back to work. I've been out of work now for over 4 months, because of being put on bedrest near the end of my pregnancy. I am returning back to work for financial reasons. We could live with me as a SAHM but money would be alittle tighter then we'd like. So I decided to return back to work. But I think its the best decision although still a hard one. But the best one for right now. With my job I work full time but I work at a school... so I constantly have days, weeks, holidays, and summers off. So it to me is the perfect job if any being a mother now, because I have so many days off. On top of sick days & personal days. And all the time off is paid (except for maternity leave and disability). So to me it is the best set up. Not to mention the school that I work at is VERY hard to get into and with me working there she will be able to get in without having to get on the waiting list. Then my hubby and my schedule works out so that my daughter would only need to be watched about 3 days a week -if that. And her Grandmother will watch her those days. And the best part about that is she gets to bond with her Grandmother, and her Grandmother lives on the same street as my job so she's only a minute or two away from me during the day.     To me this is the best set up for now. I return back to work in alittle over a week... and it will be hard.But in the long run for right now it is whats best.  After this school year... I may consider returning only part time, or possibly not at all...But we will see then. But for now I am going to return back to work fulltime at least until the end of the school year.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Both.    We need the income, but I can't imagine how I would keep my sanity without daily adult interaction.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	I work for financial reasons and my husband stays home.  We would reverse it but he doesn't have as high of earning power as I do in his former career.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	The day my daughter went to school full time I went looking for a job for something to do, started working the next day and haven't stopped since.    I enjoyed staying at home with her prior to full time education.  Nowadays we have got used to the extra money and would miss it if it wasn't there.    Don't take any notice of judgemental people who may answer, it's what is right for you in your circumstances, they are not in the same position and therefore have no right to judge, hopefully you wont get any of those though.
JdzjoZtvaa	oh my god im so excited for you im giving you a guess answer. when implantation occurs its connects to your blood so i guess that's when the hcg starts being produced i think you should test saturday morning. your chart looks so perfect how long have you been charting? do you have any more symptoms beside the spotting.im also awaiting my AF suppose to come on sunday but the only symptom i have is sore boobs.     Baby dust to us please keep me posted !!!|`|422baec93c2e09175c8e2ab1b0c51d3baa	when i had implantation bleeding, it did take about 2-3 days for the HPT to show positive.|`|H74F8jxuaa	Take one in a couple of days.  Best of luck to you!|`|lSAdkvDFaa	Fingers crossed babe! It says you need to give it a few days after implantation bleeding but there are a few who have got a bfp later on the day the bleed stopped. Give it a few days.  x|`|6GIp6pM3aa	Sounds like implantation bleeding to me...you have to wait about another week to test though at the earliest..Good Luck to you BABY DUST!!|`|0Qiscnkeaa	Since you are 8DPO, you could ask your doctor for a blood test or try testing in the morning. It may be negative for a few days since the hCG does not synthesize in the urine for a few days after the blood. The hCG also won't start building up in the blood until implantation has occurred. Now, if you are like me, you would start testing right now.    I can't speak to your chart since I only did it one month and gave up. Too many variables in correct temps as my OB told me but I didn't listen.    I wish you the best of luck!!! Loads of baby dust!!!|`|IWinNj2saa	They say usually implantation bleeding is a sign that you can take a pregnancy test, but I wouldn't trust it. If you do decide to take a test, and it comes out negative, remember, its probably just to early.
Hu9yquP4aa	Headaches are common in the second trimester. I know if I do not drink at least 80 oz of water a day... I have wicked ones from dehydration. Cut out everything but water, see how you feel.|`|hNiKE6Ptaa	try motion sickness wrist bands.  i never had a morning sickness problem but a friend of my swore by the wrist bands.  just a strap with a ball type object inside that sits on your pressure point (in the wrist) which in turn relieves the nausea, its also nice because you arent putting anything into your body or baby's that may not be necessary. Hope this helps

If you don't.. ummm No.|`|yV8fog7Paa	I like Myka better.|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I don't like it sorry!|`|Z8jKYm8baa	i think its cute and unusual       http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|YseGAHIfaa	it will be open to a lot of pronunciation problems. If you or your partner is Dutch then yes.. otherwise no.|`|AA11103493	It's unusual but nobody (except the Dutch) will be able to pronounce it without being told how to, and on hearing the name people will mis-spell it all the time.|`|6hb04Ow0aa	Cool. I like the spelling. Is it a boy or girl's name? Very nice either way!|`|EPIELNBuaa	well i like the name itself, the spelling is a little weird. but ultimately it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks as long as you like it.|`|zMNgG9m0aa	it's pretty but she'll probably hate having to spell and pronounce her name her whole life............... i've married into a dutch family and I just offer my surname as "van" most of the time.... it's easier.
848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	Tell him and Ignore your dad's whining if he does react the way you think he will. Your teeth crowding isn't your fault. Just be careful how you tell him... Instead of saying "dad, my teeth hurt, I need to go to the doctor", say: "dad, my wisdom teeth are coming in and there is no room for them and they're hurting me. My school nurse said that i need to see a dentist before it hurts my other teeth".  That's all.|`|naPYuaDQaa	No, you can't do that by yourself.    Your dad won't be mad at you. He should know that wisdom teeth are a big problem for the rest of your teeth. He should understand.|`|ac4kIyYDaa	its not your fault that your wisdom teeth hurt and are growing in that happens to almost everybody and almost everybody has to get them removed i don't think if you tell your dad he will be mad about it..you should try to get it taken care of soon before it does push all of your teeth together. Also ive been to the dentist before without my parents when i was under 18 i just made an appt and had my insurance cards and just said they were at work and dropped me off, or you can have someone who's over 18 that's related to you take you.
kprKXEOSaa	What she's doing isn't polite, so it's nice you want to be polite, but she doesn't care about such things, why should you?  She is using you.  Her child is not your responsibility, even if you feel guilty that the child would be in a better environment with you than with her loser of a mother who just dumps her wherever for whatever reason.  Next time she calls, just say, "sorry, that won't work for me."  Repeat as necessary.  You've got better things to do with your time than be a free daycare for this woman.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Well, you could tell her that if she doesn't start paying you and bringing over her child's own food, you won't be able to watch her kid anymore.      Or, just tell her that you have your own child and you don't have time to take care of hers all the time as well.  She needs to be a parent.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Tell her that you are starting up an in home day care.  Ask her how much you think you should charge for the service.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	She`s just using you as a (friend!).  She figures you are a soft touch.  Is your husband still around? What does HE say about this.  If he is, I would tell her straight out  - your husband disagrees that you look after her kid for free like this, and he is telling you you must start charging her for this service.    Alternatively tell her social services have rung you and said someone has reported you for child-minding without a licence, and that you will get into serious trouble if you continue doing this.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Tell her you are not in a position to be watching her child anymore  If she says why not, I would say its really none of your business since she is being so rude, but since you want to be nice, just say it is personal reasons|`|Kr09aQJkaa	When she calls to ask you to babysit just say NO. You don't have to be rude or explain why. If you try to explain she'll think you're open to persuasion. No matter what she comes back with after you say NO just keep repeating NO.     Can you watch Jr. til 2 today?   No.  Why? Are you going somewhere?  No. Today isn't a good day.  I can pick him up by 12 if that would be easier.  No.  I have no one to watch him and I have to be at the doctor.   Oh? I can't watch him today.   What am I going to do?  IDK? I can't watch him.  Why?  Today isn't a good day.  Why?  No. I'm not able to babysit today. I have to go. I'll talk to you later. Bye.    I would much rather her be angry at me than be treated like a door mat. On days you feel like babysitting say yes on days you don't say no. Invite him over when you feel up to it. You don't have to be at her beck and call. It's nice of you to sit with him but you decide when it is convenient for you not her. She'll catch on sooner or later that she needs a back up plan when you aren't available.|`|SZdT1r8saa	Maybe the next time she asks, tell her you have plans later and won't be able to watch her.  If you get the opportunity, tell her something about not having extra food for her child or directly ask her for some money.  I know you're wanting to be polite.  Just tell her things are tight and you'll need payment for watching her.  So, you'll either get paid or she'll stop asking just so she won't have to pay you.|`|zMNgG9m0aa	start a new exercise program that involves you taking your child for a walk every time she wants you to babysit.    tell her you've got lice/chickenpox/measles/influenza or something in the house!    at least ask her point blank to provide food!|`|nfzQkvqraa	I didn't read the other posts yet, so this might seem repetitive. Sorry.    I have that same "friend."  At some point I gave her the impression that I'm a pushover and she will take advantage of it at any opportunity she can.  We've known each other for 20 years though and I find it difficult to tell her how I truly feel.  She has become a train wreck though.  I justify my watching her kids for free and doing things for her with the fact that I know her kids have a horrible home life.  At least when they're with me they're being taken care of.    However I feel the way you do often times.  I try to avoid her.  I know if I ever confronted her with how I feel I would never hear from her again.  Maybe that's best for me.  Anyway I don't have a lot of advice.  Just wanted to let you know that I know how you feel.|`|Rn9SO1Wjaa	That definitely sounds very familiar. I had a friend that used to do that to me but sometimes she would even go ahead and do it to my little sisters!!! her phone was always dying or she just wouldn't pick up... her baby was a newborn and the baby wouldn't stop crying hours at a time (colic) and when she would appear it would be in the middle of the night and by then the baby would finally be asleep!! Well needless to say this went on for quite sometime until I just said enough!!It wasnt like I dinsnt like her kid I love him but it doesnt feel good to be taken advantage of my husband thought that she was taking advantage of me... I am like you I don't know how to tell people no specially if she is a friend, unlike you this was a close friend!! anyway once I had my daughter I stopped working to take care of my baby and she started calling almost on an every day basis she would ask me to take care of her son cause she  had to work and she had to do this and that, I helped her out a couple of times and that didnt sit well with my husband eventually she would just drop him off and go about her business and give me a lame excuse that I didn't buy  so one day I just told her that my  baby was draining me out and that I wanted to nap because she is keeping me up at night even though it was a lie  I would say this before she even started talking whenever she would call so that she knew before she even asked that the answer was no!!! eventually she started getting it and I don't allow myself to take care of any of her kids she has 3 now!!! she is just the type of person that if you say yes to her once, then they expect it all the time!!  hope this helps you out!!
yOyg3gnJaa	I was prescribed the same thing, but only 1 50mg b6 a day.  Was told I could take it as long as I needed, so I'm still using it now, and probably will throughout the entire pregnancy as all of my pregnancies make me sick the entire 9 months.  Congrats and Good Luck.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Yes, I took it for my pregnancies.    I am on week 26 and have taken it since week 10. Its safe.|`|KK3skQc2aa	B6 is completely safe to take the whole time you are pregnant. Its a vitamin thats found in your prenatal pills. I took it and I promise its fine. Much better then taking prescription nausia pills which some drs offer.|`|gaiCNtEFaa	I am 14 weeks and I have the same morning sickness.  Unfortunately the unisom or benadryl didn't do anything for me and I had to get a prescription.  I have been taking that almost 10 weeks.  If it wasn't ok for you to take the Dr. wouldn't tell you to take it.  I only take my pill on bad days, I have a 2 year old.  The med  knocks you out and makes you tired.  I am going to take it as long as I need to.  I also take the B6 once a day along with my prenatal.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	It is safe.  But if you are still unsure, phone your doctor and ask if it's okay to continue taking it since you still need it.  I know what you mean.  I am almost 15 weeks and I get terrible headaches.  My Dr told me Tylenol would be fine but I only take it when it gets real bad.
IWinNj2saa	Of course it's to early. it's still 5 days before your AF...most don't test positive until a week after missed AF. So there is still hope your pregnant. Sending lots of Baby Dust your way!|`|Kn90YAzYaa	I think EPT has come out with a test that can detect pregnancy hormones when you're only 1 day late.  Relax and find something you enjoy doing to pass the next 5-6 days.|`|s1utniuvaa	I think First Response has a test that it says can detect pregnancy up to 5 days before a missed period.
530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	He may be wonderfully behaved and you may have a fantastic meal on Valentines day but.....if he gets bored/hungry/ etc and plays up, imagine how awful it will be if he screams the place down. I certainly don't think other loving couples will be very pleased at the prospect of sharing their romantic interlude with someone elses crying baby.    Why not have a take away. lay a romantic table and dd some candles instead.      I agree with PIRATE P.. and I have had meals ruined by other peoples rowdy or screaming children/babies.  I am a mother and have taken care not to spoil anyones evening wherever we are when my son has become a little noisy or boisterous..its called..consideration!|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	If he can sit up then he cn go in a high chair with you next to him for safety...otherwise it will have to be the carseat on the floor...or on your knee....we gor used to eating one handed!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Just let him stay in the car seat. You never know he may sleep through the whole thing! Make sure you have a few toys for him.  If he squeals the whole time ... Oh well... You are a paying customer too. =)      ...and Pirate Princess needs to loosen up. Geesh...      To the people that are saying they don't like kids at a restaurant making noise. I think there is a BIG difference in a baby making some noise and a baby screaming bloody murder at a restaurant.  Babies "talk" by squealing, squeaking, yelling out... Most people find it a bit cute! If they don't find it cute or appreciate the situation then they have obviously never had kids. I think it is totally different though if a baby is screaming at the top of their lungs and bawling their eyes out the whole meal. THEN I would consider that offensive.    I have a this sneaking suspicion that Pixie is a smart girl and will know when her baby is making a scene compared to making typical baby noise.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	I understand that it is Valentine's Day for you two too, but it's not very romantic for other restaurant users if baby was to get upset.  Maybe you should consider going another day if you think this may be the case?    Anyway, decency aside, does baby sit upright?  If so they could use a high chair, if not, put in the baby carrier you usually use and sit on a spare chair.  If the table is a deux, maybe you could ask for another chair to sit it upon, as long as this doesn't interfere with H&S restrictions, such as blocking exits etc.    Edit @ your edit: I hate it when people think it's ok for their little darlings to scream the place down, it's not down to expensive restaurant or not, it's down to manners.  Or do you think that your baby should be the centre of everyone's attention just because it is to you?  Remember that your baby is your world, not everyone elses.    Sorry, didn't resalise you were going to a chav pub, should be fine there.    Valentine's day is NOT meant for families, but for couples, there's every other day of the year or you could cook at home.    Thank you, susie, I am a mother too and never found the need to let my child interrupt an occasion just because I want to go out.    Jade: That's exaclty the reason you DON'T take babies out on Valentines day, because you can't control their crying.  Please feel free to look up 'ettiquette'.....|`|pDRAciBnaa	im going to guess that 'pirate_princess' doesn't have children,as unfortunately we cannot control a babies crying!! they cry when they please just like you speak when you please,its their way of communicating!! god some people are so damn rude,and ignorant!!    right about your valentines meal,go wherever the hell you want to eat,even if it wasn't somewhere baby friendly,you shouldn't care what morons like ^^above think :)    i always used to take the car seat into the restaurant,and get baby out to sit with me,then when its time to eat i would just pop her back in for 10Min's or so!! take a few toys,ones you know keep him entertained...don't forget it will be busy,hopefully this will keep him distracted and a little entertained!!    i think its great your taking him,and have a lovely meal.. :)|`|1Si9RlEXaa	Some people must be hermit once they have a baby, not me. It might even be good for a small child so they learn how to behave in restaurant.     I however think it's perfectly fine to take your baby to a family restaurant. I have been since she was almost 3 weeks old. She has never cried an cried and ruined someone else's meal. Some restaurant do have slings that your car seat goes into so that way baby can look at you and even play with some toy, or you can use a chair next to you or if it's a booth and the car seat will fit facing you. Most of the time I end up holding my daughter, she is just now starting to sit in High Chairs and loves it. Go at a time when baby is most relaxed and happy, not during fussy hour. And if you go a little early like say 5pm the restaurant wont be as busy so it may not irritate your baby as much.     I was a waitress for 6 years and worked at both family and fancy restaurants. People always brought they're babies to restaurants and we never thought twice about it most of the time they didn't cry, in fact I loved it when I had a baby at my tables. They are so cute. Other table never seemed annoyed by other babies or children. Like you said they have even a separate eating area for family, so people looking for a quiet romantic time will not go there.     Have fun with you Hubby you deserve it.|`|AA11103493	My son was able to go in a high chair at 5 months because that's the age he started sitting by himself.  Why not put him in his car seat on a chair at the table - just do whatever works for you.|`|2cstdEkIaa	bring him in his car seat. some places have slings that hold the car seats. if you have a booth, sit him on the seat  next to you|`|TqOdbhNAaa	If you feel like getting him a seat that he can sit in, you should check out the First Years Infant to Toddler seat.  It's just a seat that attaches to a chair and it's made for babies from birth on.  It reclines back and has soft padding for the younger infants.  My daughter has been using it since 4 months and she loves it.  It's definitely light weight enough to bring into a restaurant without too many problems.     If you don't feel like looking into that though, just bring your son into the restaurant in his stroller.  I doubt a family friendly restaurant, especially on Valentine's Day, is going to have a problem giving you a table with room enough for a stroller.|`|VTB5QpyBaa	My daughter is 5 months old also, and when we go out to eat we just bring her in her car seat and either put her in a chair or an upside down high chair, at most restaurants that works. The car seat fits right in there. Have fun and good luck =)|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	I've taken both of my girls to restaurants with us since they were newborns.  I bring in the carseat and stick it on a chair next to me.  If they get fussy I either nurse in the restaurant while I'm eating or hold the baby (once she can hold her head up comfortably) seated on my leg so she can interact and look around.    We've never had any problems with people being annoyed.  In fact, the waitresses were so google-eyed over our daughter last time we went out that one almost dropped a stack of pizza boxes on the floor when she bumped into a booth while oggling her.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	Just stick him ih his buggy and get them to remove a chair from your table and pull him right up beside you at the table|`|4JgSq2rlaa	either get a babysitter or let ur husband cook u up a romantic meal at home instead of going out if ur worried about it that much|`|AA11476782	We just went out with our baby who will be 5 months next Tuesday.  We brought in her car seat, in case she'd be okay sitting in that, but we also wore the Baby Bjorn.  The place we went was a buffet, so I thought it'd be easier to get up and down with her attached!  You may want to think about bringing a carrier/sling/wrap, in addition to the car seat.  At this place, we got a booth and her carseat fit in the seat.  Happy Valentines Day!|`|0zWJlNi1aa	When we went to a restuarant a few weeks ago we put our son - who was five months at the time - in his pushchair and put him sitting next to me in his pushchair.  We gave him his favourite toys to play with when our food came and then when we had finished took him out and played with him before we left and he was very happy with this!|`|mAsQbiIgaa	I have taken my baby out since she was new born to restaurants.  She has always been great thank goodness.  At 5 months we kept her in her pram and gave her toys to play with.  The restaurants were always very good about taking a chair away so you can pull it up beside you.    If she ever got unsettle we took her out and nursed her and she loved looking around.    I think people need to be more understanding.  Obviously we wouldn't have let our baby scream and make a scene and disturb other people but people need to learn to tolerate babies and children in restaurants.  I think some people think because you have a young baby you should just stay in the house!    We were trying to decide whether or not to go out on valentines day as i was conscious of all the couples enjoying their night and didn't want to disturb them with our  9 month old who loves to laugh and shout and carry on but I have decided I am!      Enjoy your night out x|`|KcWptsAuaa	most restaurants have what they call a sling it sets up and can sit carseat in it. or if they flip a wooden highchair upside down that can fit. i often would ask for a table big enough to sit my ds right up on the table in his carseat then would bring him toys that way he was eye level and out of the way of passer bys so they wouldn't touch him haha! but whoever tells you to stay home shame on them...but this is coming from one of those horrible mothers who descretly nurses in public shame on me! (being sarcastic)|`|nT7NGReUaa	I hope we are not going to the same restaurant, I want to spend the evening with my g/f and not be surrounded by children for a change. There is a time and place for everything, Valentines is not a time for kids|`|Wu16Ur07aa	why don't you, as a decent loving woman, cook your own very special, romantic meal at home while your little boy is tucked up in bed.  It'll save money!  You have to fit your life around your children, not your children around your life.
60ApQsGOaa	I'm irregular too. The only way I know I'm ovulating and am about to get my period is about a week or two before I get my period, I gain a ton of water weight and i get REAL moody! I like to call it "crazy fat ***** syndrome". So if you are experiencing crazy fat ***** syndrome, then it prolly means your ovulating and will prolly get your period soon|`|UAyoep38aa	I too have irregular periods, but I can tell if I am going to have my period with I call my ovulation pains. Maybe you experience like achy pains mid cycle. I know it's when I am ovulating and will get my period in 2 weeks. Works like a charm.  I haven't used them, but I hear that a lot of women get pregnant faster once they start using Ovulation sticks. Use a few what you know it is mid cycle between the shortest and longest cycles that you have had.  Good luck and baby dust!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Get an OPK and it will tell you when you are ovulating.|`|c3WJMgA1aa	it may be hard to tell.  But if you get an OPK, it will tell you.  Good luck!
aLwrpMPXaa	My husband has never had an affair but has failed me as a man not as a father so many times ! We have been together for 10 years and have two children. I have made the decision to "suck it up and shrug it off" because I love the "father he is to my children" and they absolutely adore him. I know, he is a good husband and father and although I am so many times left alone with the role of a parent, I know also, I have sacrificed myself as a woman to raise the kids as normal as possible. My problems do not include a "third person" and I cannot even suggest what you should do. I only agree with you on one thing: yes, we as mothers, take on a lot of crap to make our own children happy. Good luck and don't be too harsh on yourself ! Talk to him as of why, you would or not stay with him ! He needs to know the truth at all times !|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Based on what I know about your situation (previous questions, etc) and my own feelings..... I think 2 people should always work it out when possible.  I am strongly against divorce when it's not necessary.  However, I am also able to try to put myself in your shoes.  As I said before, I admire those who can move on after things like this.  I, on the other hand, would not be able to.  I would be, as you said, constantly worrying and would never be able to trust him again.  He threw all trust you had for him out the window and if you don't feel you will be able to trust him again, consider this.........  your son will be MUCH better off going through a divorce at this age verses as a toddler or older child.  It will have much less impact on him right now.      If you are considering changing your mind and working this out, you two need to seek counseling ASAP.|`|AA10811784	First of all... you are NOT a bad mother for feeling like this! You are not the one that cheated! You are not the one that made things fall apart. Personally, I would not be able to get past this and forgive him. I would never be able to trust him again and would not be able to stay with him. Your son is much better off if you divorced, instead of living a lie and trying to make it work. Get the divorce over with now, before your son gets older. He is too young to realize what is going on and he is also at an age where he will get used to changes fairly quickly.     That being said, I also hope that his father still decides to be in his life.Your son is an innocent bystander and I sure hope his father doesn't decide to not spend time with him because of this.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	*Hugs*    You need to go get some counseling.  Believe it or not, you are doing the best thing for your child right now.  I know it's hard at the moment, but Sam will realize that you did what you had to do in order to make yourself, your husband and him in a better place.  You haven't failed as a parent.  You are looking out for everyone's best interests.      You are going to be okay, I promise.  Sam has the best momma in the world!|`|xK6wehG7aa	First let me say, I am not defending your husband in any way, or trying to change your decision. However, I know from experience that sometimes people's minds and emotions are in a very bad place and they make stupid, regrettable decisions. Sometimes, unfortunately, it takes something like this to open someone's eyes to what they have before them. It took me almost divorcing my husband to make me realize how wonderful and right we are for each other.    If you are thinking of changing your mind, you and your husband need to get into counseling as soon as possible. Make your marriage very open to each other, never hold anything inside. If he's late, don't assume the worst, demand to know where he was and what he was doing. He owes you that at the very least.    I think if he has truly seen the error in his ways, then you shouldn't have much to worry about. Hopefully, he has really changed like he says he has.     I am all for working on things, but if you believe in your heart that you will NEVER trust him again. Then, there's no point in working on things because they'll never get better. You both have to go into this new relationship with open hearts and open minds and leave the past in the past if you want it to work.     I hope things get better for you soon! Please keep in mind that none of this is because of anything you did. You are not a bad mother. Not even close!|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Hey girl I've been there. Read some of my q&a from about a year ago and you'll see what I mean.     Give me a bit. I'll send you an e-mail when my boss goes to lunch. He's been in & out of my office way too much today.    Hang in there, sweetie.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	It sounds like you are at the worst point in your marriage/divorce and it's completely normal for you to feel this way about your husband. You need someone to talk to and vent about these things. You CANNOT expect to handle it all on your own. That is why counseling is so crucial, even if it's not to repair your marriage but to make things work out between the two of you just well enough to co-parent this child so he doesn't feel abandoned by either parent. What your husband did was wrong. Personally if I was in your position (just b/c I'm strongly against divorce) I would separate for a period of time until you have regained some emotional stability and then seek counseling to try and work things out. Whether you stay with him or not, it will take a long time to heal from this. YOU NEED A SUPPORT GROUP!!! Whether it be some personal friends or family members that you can call and talk to at any time or a counselor.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I know it seems like an easier route to take him back for your sons sake but please don't.Do not take your husband back if you don't feel you can't trust him--it'll be a big mistake.    I hope you have some family/friends around you But by the sounds of your add on I'm thinking not and I feel for you bc I would be in the same boat, not knowing where to turn to.  Keep using YA, that's what it's here for.    Right now I'd just say to your son that ''daddy's at work'' and just try to be strong for your sons sake, try to normalize things for him as much as you can. Get out of the house, get into some playgroups and perhaps talking to others may help and point you out where to go next|`|JlDcVTVsaa	You are already doing the right thing.  If you cant be happy with your husband your baby will know that as well.  and it wont be much better than now.    Im sure its really difficult for you to see your baby calling his dad, but it will also be difficult for him if when he is a teenager his father leaves you and your son for an other family.   your son will be really hurt. and you will be hurt too.    and also if he comes back but you are not happy, you wont be able to be a good mom while you are always stressed because of your husband.     but you are right your baby still needs his dad, so maybe you can arrange some time, for the dad to come and spend with your son. if the dad doesnt want to do that, then you are both better off without him.    Im really sorry this happened to you, but now because of your baby you should be strong.  try to do things that makes you both happy, and forget about the loser dad.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Honey, its okay. Its going to be okay.  You are a raw nerve right now, right? You need some time to think.  A marriage does not have to be over because of an affair.  It can be if you want.  I am a firm believer in doing what is best for me and my family.  Heres what I THINK i would do (I can say this because I don't have the emotions of being confronted with all of this right now) I would give myself some time and space.  I would not do anything drastic or rash.  When I was able to see a little more clearly I would go to counseling.  I would see if this is something that I could work through.  Maybe i could, maybe I couldn't.  I would hope that i would try.  Thats all I can do, is try right?  The very things that are happening to you right now are always what has held me in my house when I've wanted to run away from my husband. (no hes never cheated but we have had and have our share of issues)  when I think i can't do this another day, I think about my kids and what is really best.  I could throw in the towel, no one would judge me, I have valid issues, but I could also stay and try and work with my husband.  that is my choice.  My advice to you - take time for you and your head and your heart.  You have been violated in  very bad way.  Your trust is completely gone.  That has to be worked through.  He needs to earn his way back into your heart.  I have no idea how to do that.  Try and do some counseling - for you, him and together.  Then you can make a decision that is best for everyone and go to sleep at night knowing that you did what was best, not what was in the moment.    Thats my thought process.  Use YA as your vent place.  By all means.  not sad.  its just easier to talk to faceless strangers.    good luck to you my dear.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I have a friend who was in your situation, but her children were 5 and 7 years old. He husband cheated and would not work to support the family and gambled away all the money. But, she kept taking him back for the children's sake. This led her to have a miserable life. Her children were also miserable because even though they got to see daddy every night, they also got to listen to all the screaming and fighting between their parents. If you are not going to be happy with this man, then get a divorce. Your son will be fine. He will get to see his dad as he grows up and you will find happiness with someone who will treat you and your son right.|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	having parents who constantly fight is REALLY hard on a kid. harder than divorce even.     if you don't think you can work it out. then it is the right thing to do.    good luck. i'm sorry this happened to you.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Wow, I feel like i want to cry for your situation.  I'm so sorry you're going through this.    If it were me, I'd do what you have done.  It is better to separate now and let your son adjust at two instead of older.  Give your son the opportunity to see and know what a loving marriage is about.  There is really no chance of that now, after what your husband has done.  You must also keep in mind that you are doing nothing to your son.  Your husband has broken your marriage, damaged it beyond repair.  He should be ashamed of himself.      You don't want your son to grow up in a loveless marriage with a miserable mother.  You know that he will sense all that is underlying.  This is not a selfish decision on your part; it is your husband who made the selfish decision.|`|Ud871v3paa	Honey...you're a great mother.  I was a child who grew up in a home where my dad was addicted to porn and my mom had an affair and the ONLY reason they stayed together was because of us and it really screwed us up as children.  When i was younger I prayed they never would seperate but now that I am a mother and older I fully understand everything that happend and it was sick, wrong, disgusting and heartbreaking.  I saw things and heard things NO child should ever have to hear and I could never do that to my son.    Don't feel like a bad mother, you are a strong woman for being able to walk away from this, and your son will one day realize the sacrifice you made for him, because no child should grow up in a house with an un happy mother and father....good luck babe and I'm sorry, stay strong.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Hey, don't for one second think you have failed your child, because his dad is a dog.  As they always say, if you are happy, truely happy then your children will be happy to.  When your son is older he will understand why you left your husband.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Staying together in an unhappy marriage for your kids is the worst thing you can do to them... trust me.|`|fEF2WoaYaa	If you cant be happy with this man then you should divorce him. Your son will be fine its better now when he is young than when he is say 7 or 8. To be a good mother you need to be happy and healthy you are not at fault here he is He did this to you and his family best of luck and don't beat yourself up|`|IWinNj2saa	In the long run, if you stay with him, your son would suffer just as much, if not more, from all of the argueing and tension in the house. It's better this way. You know you won't be happy ever again with him, there's nothing you can do to change that. It would always be in the back of your mind, and would eventually start fights that wouldn't otherwise be needed. Just be strong. In the end, it's you who has to decide, from the heart, what is best for you, because sometimes what you think is best for your kids, isn't always the case. Hang in there, it will get better.|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	Before going on a tangent, consider joint and individual counseling. Most churches offer it through a pastoral program for couples in crisis.    They can help you sort things out and if possible, help to heal the relationship.    Infidelity isn't always a deal breaker when a couple gets help.    But if he isn't willing to get help, go by yourself for help anyway. You need to sort out your options prior to making any decisions that will affect your family.    Your son will need to have interaction with his father no matter what the outcome of the marriage issues are. Do all that you can to keep that line of parent and child communication open.    If the father refuses to participate, it would be better for him to abrogate all rights so that your child isn't raised like a yo-yo.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Plain and simple...you child needs a happy mommy and happy home life. Children can sense sadness and anger. If you feel that divorce is the only thing that will make you whole from this...then do it.     Your child will heal with you.|`|p61Ccuvyaa	i ahve a sister that used to cheat on her husband like crazy.. he would always take her back. they have a little girl together.. they have been married since 1996. well she was out cheating on him in 2007 and coming down interstate 95 in va and got into a horrible accident and she almost died.. well needless to say she made it through but is paralyzed from her chest down.. her husband once again stuck thriugh it with her. well now in 2009 the tables have benn turned on her and he is cheating on her in front of her face though in her bed while she is home.. god has a way of working things out.. it might be hard to leave the man but everybody can change everybody makes terrible mistakes in there life.. it is what you do with it and how you change and the man changes.. me myself i would give him one more chance.. you married for better or worse.. right now this is wrse. he might truly feel terrible for the things he has done. i dont know ultimatly it is your descion to do what you feel is best. keep an open mind and heart.. best wishes to you..|`|nfzQkvqraa	If you KNOW that you will never be happy with him, I think you'd be failing your son a whole lot more by staying with your husband.  Think  aboutit this way-  Your almost 2 year old son will have a much easier time adjusting to havig to seperate homes than he will when he's 6 or 10 or 13.  That's when they don't fully understand what's going on, but they'll want to point a finger because they are hurt.  At this point you son won't even remember having the home life you have created for him so far.  Letting him get used to something for years of his life and then taking it away will be a lot harder.  Not to mention that there will be  a lot of kinks to work out with visitation, child support, rules with raising him.  It's probably better to start that right away so that he doesn't remember any of the animosity if there is some ya know?    Also, a happy mommy is pretty important in having a happy child.  If you're miserable and don't trust your husband your child will pick up on that.  I grew up wishing my parents would get a divorce.  As an adult I STILL think they should.  They stayed together out of obligation  I think, and lazyness because it was easier.  But they're very unhappy people and they have become toxic to each other.  That's no good.    Good luck in your decision, and I hope you feel better.  I'm sure these things can be very hard and a lot of weight is on your shoulders right now.  Smile and try to remember all the good things you have going for you.  (like your beautiful son!)|`|upk9TNWsaa	No. You do what's right for you and in time that is what's right for your son. If you and your hubby stayed together and you behaved the way your saying you would, then your son would be watching all of this. He would hear you and daddy fight and that would be worse. Your son is only two now and he will get accustomed to your new life. He will still see his daddy. I am remarried and I left my daughters father I stayed with him longer because I thought that would be best for my daughter but suddenly realized all the arguing and fighting and whatever else in the home was not the best thing for her. Now I am doing so good with my husband whom I trust and hardly argue with and we provide a great enviroment for my daughter. Your son needs a happy home regardless.     Sorry that your husband did that to you, I think you can find someone who will honor you and wouldn't cheat on you. You will be okay but you just have some work to do now. I did it with nothing really. Just take the opportunity and start a happy life with you and your son right now.|`|jLYTKr33aa	My dear, you did not fail your son - your husband did.  He failed your entire family by doing what he did.    While I do think some people split up too hastily, I think it's definitely justified in your case.  It will be much better for your son to live with a single, happy mother (and you will be happy again) than to live with a miserable, married one.  Your son will get used to the new arrangement, and it will be best for all of you.  Hang in there.|`|59GymH27aa	Your son needs a Mum who is happy, not a Mum who is miserable because of someone else.  You haven't failed your son at all...you can tell by your question that you are willing to put him completely before yourself.  That makes you a fantastic mother.  It will be hard without your husband but you are doing the right thing by not taking him back.  Your son will eventually understand that his dad doesnt live with you anymore.  Good luck though and take care x|`|GRyFxwTbaa	One of his parents DID fail him, and it wasn't you.    Will your son suffer for his father's behavior?  Yes he will.  He already is.    What would be best for him?  Having his parents love and trust each other, but that's out the window.    Whether or not you could or would forgive your husband is entirely up to you.  This is a bad spot that isn't your fault but is your problem.    I'm sorry for you and your son, and I'd curse your husband with impotence if I could.|`|AA12145826	Please don't apologize, you haven't done anything wrong. Questions like yours are why Y!A is here. I am so terribly sorry that you are having to go through this.     May I please suggest a few things?    1) Make an appointment to see a counselor. Not necessarily for marriage counseling, but for yourself. You seem stressed right now and I would venture to guess that having an objective 3rd party involved to help you sort out all your emotions would really help. Please do this for YOU. Because if you aren't able to take care of yourself, it will make taking care of your son all that more difficult.    2) Make an appointment to see a divorce lawyer. Even if you're not sure if you are going to go through with it. Many lawyers charge nothing or very little for the initial consultation and they can at least let you know what your options are and what to expect. My sister is currently interning at a family law practice (not her first choice, but she needed to see if it would be a good fit for her...its not) and told me to give you a heads up that the lawyer is going to be all about "sympathizing" with you over your situation and may play up your emotions. This is what they do to make money, its just the reality of the situation. Remember that this is the time to set emotions aside (yes, he deserves to be castrated by a billion fire ants, but set that aside for a moment) and be pragmatic. This is the time to think about what is best for you and your son.    3. If you think you can try to take him back, set ground rules and stick to them. If you want to him to see a counselor on an individual basis as well as couples counseling: he goes willing or its over. If you want him to spend more time at home, taking care of his son as opposed to him going "out to the bar with buddies" (or whatever he likes to do): he happily does it or its over. This isn't about punishment. It isn't even about atonement. This is about him building back up all that trust that he so carelessly destroyed with HIS actions. In a way, its about the two of you starting your relationship over from scratch.    4. If you don't think you can take him back (because I know I would not be able to if my husband had an affair), take time to mourn the loss of your marriage as you would the loss of a loved one (because in a way, its the same thing). In time you will be able to find a way to accept it and move on.    I wish you luck with your decision.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Your question: "Do I take my husband back and sacrifice my own happiness so my son can have his mommy and daddy at home every night?"    That depends. Why did the affair happen? Is it over? Is he truly sorry? Does he have a history of cheating? Are you able to put on a happy face and act as though this a happy household for your child?    There are some draw backs to getting divorced. More than likely your husband will remarry. Will he have a kind step mother? Will they parent the same way you do? I know many divorced parents who have conflicts because the step parent doesn't treat their child like the "new" children. They allow the child to do things that the other parent wouldn't allow. They send the child to dad's house for the weekend and he comes home in diapers and not using the toilet because they feel he is too young to toilet train. Or they let the 16 yr old smoke because they smoke and don't think it is a big deal.  Your husbands parenting style will change to fit his new wife. You won't have any control over what happens unless it is illegal. The court doesn't care if dad lets him drink a bottle til he's 5 or if dad does his homework for him so he can get a good grade.    You may find someone new after a divorce. Will your child like him? Will they get along? Will the new man accept him and not treat him different? If you have children with the new man how will your child feel living in a house with his mom, her husband and THEIR children? Sometimes kids feel like the outsider.    I would suggest you stay but only if he isn't known for cheating. Most of the time cheating is the symptom not the problem. Find out why he did this. Was he horny? Did she make him feel important? It is possible to heal after an affair. You have every right to be hurt and angry but don't let his mistake take it's toll on you and eat you up. There are a lot of things you can do to get started on healing and repairing the relationship. Too many to list. If you want to email me I think I can be helpful.    Best of luck to you and your family!|`|WirFwirLaa	Oh, thats awful. You just made me cry!!!!    But no, you do not sacrifice your happiness for your child. And that child will thank you for it later. What kind of 'happy home' will your child grow up in when mommy no longer loves or trust daddy? Sometimes a child is much better off being raised by divorced parents if that means that the parents are happy & content.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	You didn't fail your child, your husband did.     I think you're doing the right thing. Wouldn't you rather raise your child in an environment where his mother is happy and not totally miserable?    Kids adjust well. He is very young. Soon you'll create new memories and the memory of his father being in the house will fade.     You need to stop saying things like "My life is falling apart" and start saying things like "I'm making a new life for myself". I'm sure it's going to be hard but most important things are...    You just never know where life might take you. Seeing this as a learning experience will make you grow as a person. You just might be happier than you could ever imagine in a few years and realize it took this devastation to get where you are.     Keep your chin up. Learn to love yourself. Take care of yourself. Your son will be much better off because of it.     Hugggggggggggggggggggggggg. Hang in there :)|`|E1ppYqCtaa	Please do not take that man back. Your son will respect you more later on as a woman, a friend, and a mother. My mother stayed with my father for 10 yrs and it went from cheating to abuse. She was so ran down by the time she left that she had blamed herself for everything and on several occasions tried to commit suicide. Until the day she became so unstable that I ended up in foster care for 8 years.  Yes it will hurt to leave and yes it will be hard and yes you will wonder at first if you did the right thing, but there will come a day when it hits you that you suddenly feel a sense of sorrow for the woman he is with now. It is called the 80/20 rule. In a marriage he will get about 80% of what he needs out of the relationship, but this new woman is only gonna give about 20% because she thinks that she "won" and is the better woman. But don't worry you got the best of him and it is all in lil Sammy.|`|Nq7TtSVNaa	It seems that you have unconsciously stated what it is you truly desire to do in your question itself.  You put that answer within the question.  You said that sacrifice is a part of the whole thing and taking him back may give your son a better life and may give you a better life as well.  You feel betrayed but do not forget the love that you had for this man.  You are acting out of emotion.  There may never be one worthy of marriage as he was.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	If getting a divorce makes you a bad parent then a lot of kids have bad parents.    If your marriage is over and you do not think you can move past this then you have two options.  You can move on and get the divorce or you can try a separation and get some counseling and see if maybe things can get back on track but no matter what option you decide you have to make the choice that is best for you.  Yes your son will be affected but if his mommy is miserable that will affect him a lot more than a divorce.    My parents divorced when I was 3 for the same reasons.  I do not remember the divorce although my older sisters did but we all turned out fine.  We had our weekends with dad and we knew that both our parents loved us even if they didn't love each other.  We grew up with them both being their to support us and them being friends.  They never bad mouthed each other in front of us and were more than willing to work together when visits had to be changed or something for us had to be paid.    Please don't take this as I am telling you to go out and divorce your husband.  That is a private thing, an emotional journey an only a choice you can make, you know what you ca and can't live with but if you get a divorce that does not mean the two of you are divorcing your son only each other.  He can still be a loving father and be there for his son even if it is in a different way.  At 2 your son is very resilliant and as long as the two of you part and do it amicably your son will grow up to be a normal happy little boy.    For now when your son wants daddy and goes around looking for him just tell him daddy had to go by by and he will see him soon.  If and when you seperate allow him to spend time with his father on a regular basis.  An affair is hard but it does not mean he doesn't love his son only that he can't keep his pants zipped.    Good luck but you are not a bad parent.  You are a mom who loves her son with all her heart and ust wants the best for him.|`|GnXfEdegaa	My heart goes out to you!!  I went through a divorce many years ago, but I didn't have a child then.  You are feeling pulled more because you have to not only think of yourself, but of your child. My x cheated on me, I left and it was the right thing to do. If I would have had a child it still would have been the right thing to do (to leave) as he was also abusive. I have a 10 yo dd now, so it's been many years since that experience and I think it all depends on the situation.  Dr. Phil says what's worse than being in a bad marriage (w/or w/out children) is being in a bad marriage one day longer. I can't remember his exact wording.  He's all for not putting children through the mess.  What is I feel like Y!A is the only outlet I have right now???|`|nPtzoAmAaa	Im going to be very honest here and your not going to like my answer. In fact i predict many thumbs down. In my life there has not been a single man, (besides my husband) who has not had an affair. Trust me when I say this caused many trust issues at the beginning of my marriage, even though my husband did nothing to deserve my suspicions. From my biological father, to my step father, to two of my grandpas and even uncles all in my family have at some point in there marriage stepped out. Is this right? NO. Is it fair to expect any woman to stick with the marriage going crazy thinking what is he doing? or worse is the other girl prettier? Am I not good enough? What did i do wrong? I have never been there, but I was old enough to understand what was going on when my step dad (who i consider my daddy) cheated on my mom. It was a very hard point, and there were many times they would literally fight, not him but my mom would just hate him so much she would pound on his chest and tell him to leave. I was 15 and was scared to death, i didn't know if i wanted him to stay, or go. I loved them both but she honestly looked like a shell of a person. She tried putting on more make up to look prettier, stuff like that. You know what my dad would do when she hit him, or screamed at him and told him she couldn't do it anymore. He would hold her and very honestly cry. He cried when i told him in anger he was no different than my biological father and that i never wanted to marry someone like him and he prayed like i have never seen my dad pray before. He screwed up, but they got through it. Believe me when I say my parents still have problems, 6 years later. It is not by any means easy, and the suspicion or guilt never really go away. I cannot imagine being in your situation and I pray I never will be, BUT seeing my parents push to get through this made me know it is possible. You do love them again, in fact my parents have never been closed on what happened, and they will say you somehow love each other even more. Please don't think I am making light of your situation, or that I even might pretend to understand it by any means, like i said, I was the child not the wife and pray I will never be the wife- but i have made up in my mind that if my husband, for whatever reason is unfaithful to me we are going until death does us part. I mean we will make this work until it does, or we die trying. You know the heart of your husband and only you know if he has the fear of God and the love for you to realize his mistakes. Right now, what your child is going through, well it wil pass one way or the other. He will adjust to divorce if that is what you intend and following through on. What you need to focus on is you and your husband. There is a way to make it work, if you are willing to sacrifice, NOT for your child, but for your marriage and he must be willing to do the same. He must be willing to sacrifice freedoms that he once had or may feel entitled to. Please don't give up because you know you will be unhappy, because in the end your happiness will depend on you alone and you may have more satisfaction in knowing you got through one of the most impossible things a marriage could go through. I've shared more about my life on this question than I ever intend to, but I feel it was justified. If you have a response feel free to email me, if not, well this opinion and 2.50 will get you a coffee and McDonald's. Good luck and I am honestly telling you I hope and pray everything will work out, whatever choice you decide to make.
j2mRop0laa	I watch Lost, Dexter, Weeds, Californication, True Blood.    None of them are on in the same season except for maybe Dexter and True Blood.     I wouldn't let my kids watch any of it. It's late night stuff.   I'm a showtime and hbo series junkie.    Oh, we all watch American Idol together. Although, my husband complains the whole time and refuses to go to the concerts with us when they tour.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	my secret indulgence is realty crap tv.  i don't watch as much as i used but no way would i let my kids watch it now.  my husband loves the sopranos and tries to watch it around the kids and i have a fit.  that is no way appropriate for a 3 year old to hear.   although  love some of the show on the food network but my daughter won't watch them.  she says they are boring.|`|4gZYucHMaa	We've been diehard CSI (original) and Survivor fans ever since they've started..our kids just started watching Survivor, they love it.    The one show I like is the kids--Hannah Montana I think it's hilarious.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I think my daughter would have nightmares forever if I let her watch Lost with us.|`|5dfde4242efae0bef67fb9df5b76b4bdaa	If I had younger kids, there's many shows I wouldn't want them to watch--especially reality shows, and my gosh, there's so many of them.  Why would I want the people who appear on reality shows to mold my kid's perception of what is real?  Like Hulk Hogan, for instance!!  Or the Housewives of Wherever!!  Or the Hugh Hefner one with the Girls Next Door or whatever that is called.  That's totally not for kids.  I also wouldn't want young children watching CSI, even for the brief times they show versions of violent deaths or autopsies.  Having said that, I do watch some of those shows, and also reality shows  like Survivor and Top Chef and American Idol (but I guess those are more competitive shows than reality).  After a hard day's work filled with real reality, I enjoy a shallow show or two so I can escape.|`|vlCWp7sSaa	Family Guy and the Simpsons. I don't know why I find it humorus but I would never let my child watch it with me.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Oh ya, I watch:    Desperate Housewives  The Bad Girls Club  Dirty Sexy Money  Rock of Love Bus    I really like the housevies and dirty sexy money, the other two I watch just to laugh at.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I don't have kids but if I did they wouldn't be able to watch Nip/Tuck till they were teens.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I tape my shows and watch them throughout the week... the interesting looking episodes of the Tyra Show, Ghosthunters, Degrassi, The Soup (hilarious!), American Idol, and here are the ones I don't want my kids watching... I Love Money 2 and Rock Of Love Bus. I watched Lie To Me (Fox) last night and it was pretty interesting. I pick start watching that as well.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	If my little one is awake when I am watching Lost, then she can watch up, but I doubt she is very interested.  The only thing she really understands is Sawyer is a bad man, and Jack is cool cause he is a doctor, or so I am told.  Other then that she is to busy playing then to pay attention|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I'm more of a movie person and a majority of those aren't suitable for a 4 and 1 year old.  So, they go in when the kids go to bed.  I'm not much for TV.  But, my husband is and there's one show he watches that I think is just horrid.... Hell's Kitchen..... not at all appropriate for most children (even much older ones).|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I don't watch any tv as it happens but we do occasionally get the videos of old shows on netflix.    It's fairly embarrassing because it's totally against both my politics and my general viewing habits, but I'm totally addicted to 24.  And no way would my kids ever see that!|`|AkFag8tNaa	I don't watch t.v. (my t.v.) until they are already in bed but yes, there are shows that I wouldn't let them watch: intervention, mad men and arrested development. The shows we watch as a family: jeopardy, Drake and Josh, and spongebob
rPZhNtwMaa	I honestly don't think you're pregnant.  Some birth control side effects are irregular periods.  Depending on the drug you're using, some months you might even NOT get your period.  This is all normal.    If you're in doubt get a pregnancy test which is the only thing that will tell you whether you're pregnant for a fact.    But honestly there is yet no reason to be alarmed.  If your birth control pills were described then you might want to give the doctor a ring if you're scared.    Do NOT look for signs of pregnancy within your body, these will be inconclusive because you are taking birth control pills.    This is very important: IF YOU WANT TO GET PREGNANT, stop using the birth control pills the FIRST day of your period.  If you already started using the pills for that menstruation period you should not discontinue the treatment as this increases the chances of abnormal pregnancy (tubal pregnancies and such).|`|Hhifw93laa	ok breath its ok..... if your Pregnant it will be ok. there a lot of people  out there that can help you care for the baby.. if not you know this time is a warning start wearing protection you can still have a baby on birth Controle that's the only way i can get pregnant. if you are i pray that you don't kill an innocent fetus God bless|`|wENdWT5kaa	Don't be scared. I would take a pregnancy test.|`|rh12tX8Naa	It's hard to say. You could be pregnant but the only way to find out is to take a test. You can either get a home pregnancy test or call your doctor.|`|RRo1la66aa	go to the doctor.|`|e5a8ca9a40c842fd6f909812078000a7aa	Take a test hun, at least that way you will know for definate!     Good luck, hope you get the answer you was looking for! xx|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Stopping the pills like that can cause in between spotting and an irregular period until your body gets back to regulating itself. Dont worry am sure your fine but if you're concerned just give your doc a call so he/she can ease your mind about this.|`|Gt3hRAA1aa	You should take a test right away, but try not to worry too much at least until you've done the test and know otherwise your period wont come as you're too stressed. Good luck.
sGA0dbvEaa	dmg.. you dont have to be so harsh on her... she said she was on birth control for 8 months, and it's clearly obvious that she's dealing with her own actions... shes just having a rough time and needed to vent...     as for you girl i'm sorry that you're going through all of this i actually am 23 and had a majorly suprising pregnancy!! it will all work out though promise.. I was so stressed out for the longest time, but then you realize it's not good for you I even took the semester off from college to relieve my stresses a bit... (and because i was worried about yucky weather too!) I really admire someone like you who's actually going to tough out the semester! Unlike me! lol good luck with your pregnancy though it's such a wonderful thing!|`|ez5BjZdRaa	Wow, you got handed alot. Um, have you tried applying through the states wellfare program? your family should help you out.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I didn't find things particularly easy and carefree at 18.  I think if you want things in your life to be different, you need to change your approach.  Everything that happens is not automatically something that someone else did to you.      Reliable birth control, for instance, would have been a good choice in your situation.  Since it's obviously too late for that advice, I think you need to evaluate your situation and make good choices that include accepting that your actions have consequences.|`|wEbB1FuNaa	Those are all horrible things that have happened but remember to always keep a positive attitude. it can only get better|`|0lnamekJaa	You think that is bad... I have Borderline Personality Disorder and associated depression and anxiety and can't afford any kind of treatment... (I've also needed a hip replacement since the age of 10... I'm 28 now and hurt all the time...)    I get 2 meds for free from the manufacturer but that is if they feel like sending them to me or feel like sending out the application to continue to get the meds...    I ran out of Welbutrin XL in December... I didn't get the refill application until the end of January... They don't take questions through their website and they wouldn't' talk to me since I was the patient...     Now I need to pay for a doctor to fill it out for me and send it in... Which I can't afford right now...     I've been having daily anxiety attacks for the last month...    I'm just trying to not harm myself until I can get my medication back...     I'm SOOOOOOOOOO happy I'm an American and have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness...     Too bad for me that my pursuit of happiness means just trying to get my mental illness under control so I can actually have a life...|`|1881f384f0ce54be24309e52cd72d1beaa	"Things are supposed to be easy and carefree!"  Whoever told you that lied, honey.  Congratulations on your pregnancy (even though it was a surprise).    If you haven't already, apply for WIC.  My experience with them has always been very positive and they are very helpful.  They should be able to help you get supplemental medicaid if your income qualifies, they will give you some food every month, they will provide counseling and guidance and classes to help you prepare for being a mom, and it's just a really great program for first time mothers.    As for all the other stuff, that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  Being a mom isn't easy either, and this is just getting you prepped to handle it.  Remember Dory on finding Nemo?  "Just keep swimming just keep swimming...."    I hate snow too.  Hugs!|`|yrDqtazLaa	I feel your pain, my dear. I really do. It's not easy, I have 2 little boys, ages 2 and 1. I haven't finished my college education. My husband and I both work, and they really aren't the best paying jobs. Bad stuff happens to us all the time, like a tire going flat, the dryer breaking, so we have no dry clothes, all kinds of dumb crap. But, through it all, we do make it. It's hard, but you have to take one thing at a time. With your pregnancy, you might want to hold off on school for a little bit until you can keep up with it, your job, and the baby. You obviously know that you will absolutely have to have a job to keep a place to live for you and the baby. You can always go back to school when you are able to do it. I want you to know, I thought about what I would be doing had I waited to have my kids, but to be honest, those kids have saved me from myself. That baby will be the best thing to ever happen to you, and you won't regret what you do to make having this baby possible. Everything will work itself out. That's what keeps me going every day.|`|EwcAR5bwaa	Apply for medicaid.  You can find out where to do it by googling it by your state.  Also try to apply for WIC (women, infants and children).  I feel your pain, I am 25 but also in college, going for nursing but still taking pre-requisites, my pregnancy was also a surprise, and have been super stressed about everything lately.  My car broke down, so all the money I had saved for the 3 months I won't be working I had to spend to fix it, otherwise how would I get to work and school! Then soon after my boyfriend got laid off from his job, so we have been struggling just to be able to eat and pay rent & bills.  I am relying on my baby showers for baby stuff.  If it wasn't for WIC I'd probably starve.  It is an awesome program, you should definitely look into it.  With medicaid they will cover you back to when you were first pregnant so payments you have had to pay to make up where your ins. lacks you should get back.  I had a $500 bill for lab work from when I was first pregnant, it was what my ins wouldn't cover, I didn't get medicaid until I was like 3 months along and they paid that bill for me.  It was such a relief.  Don't worry, everything will work out okay.  I mean, it can't snow forever!  And one day you'll have that little baby in your arms and none of this will even matter anymore.|`|sJy8zGNhaa	in 20 weeks you are going to hold the most precious little life in your arms and this will all seem like a distant thing. you cannot fathom how great this is going to feel! if you focus on that, then all the troubles will fade to the background.   what state do you live in? if we had that information i could find out how to help you find help for the medical bills|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	I was in your shoes with our 1st baby. We were engaged, I was in college and working a part-time job. We were faced with finding a place to live (we were both living with our parents at the time), supporting ourselves and preparing for a baby. So, I'm not trying to be mean by saying this to you- you knew you were risking getting pregnant by having sex.     Is life fair? No. But, you have a choice- you can mope around or you can make some changes. I had to quit school. My husband got a 2nd job. Don't worry about the people who seem to breeze through life taking advantage of the system. If they are being dishonest, karma will catch up with them. You just do the best you can for you and your soon to be family.  You have a baby on the way that needs AND deserves all you can give. It's time to realize that you have to give up worrying about what YOU want. Yes, the ideal situation would be to finish school, get a great job and then have a family. But, your choices resulted in a different course for your life.     When I first found out I was pregnant, I stayed on the couch for days crying. All I could see was all my freedom disappearing. I saw a depressing, boring life ahead of me. Four years later, I can't imagine my life without my daughter. I'm planning on starting back to school when she begins kindergarten.     I've found that a close relationship with God has helped me. I try to make time each day to spend time studying the Bible and praying. It puts me at peace and helps me stay centered.  When I got pregnant, I wasn't much worried about a spiritual life.     Bottom line- you can do it. Don't worry about what other people are doing. It's gonna be a lot of hard work, but you will get through it.
P544Sbmqaa	When I did it you learn things about developmental stages, how to change a diaper and things like that.  Baby nutrition, what the body goes through during pregnancy, discipline styles.  Things like that.  Most classes do a thing where you take care of a baby doll for a couple weeks or so.  Its stereotyped as a female class, but its great for any gender that knows they want to have children or wants to go into the child care field professionally.|`|5Mvn48dnaa	My brother did that class. I know brother but it's true. I know he had to take care of one of those dolls. He said it was kinda fun.
QikvnTnqaa	You do all KINDS of stuff. My favorite was the fake baby. It was difficult. But it has th opposite affect on me. I want to have kids more because it would be totally different if it was your own kid.   Keep in mind though, this was years ago and I"m now in college. :)
aLkCxq5aaa	My son was also 9lbs, he was 10 days overdue.   Then my daughter was 8lbs 3oz born 2 days overdue.      They say boys are bigger!  And I was given an estimate that my son would be around 7 - 7 and a half lbs! Mind u, I'm glad I didn't know before! And I'm only 5"2 and a size 10/12.  And no stitches either which I was so glad because that was the one thing I was really dreading!  I'm now 37 weeks pregnant and wondering what's in store this time around too!

Quit using your baby as a doll.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	if youre serious you need your head examined. my best idea would be to take her to someone who can care for her properly and wont try to poison her by putting crap on her fingernails when she keeps her hands in her MOUTH  most of the time at 2 weeks old.|`|bPHU2JKaaa	i painted my babys nail at to weeks. and she fine just use the non toxic kind like the kind you buy for a 5 year old. ur not a bad parent for this. i want you to know that. anywho wait intill shes a sleep.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Just wait.|`|FCY3lwnoaa	You do realize that she will end up with her fingers in her mouth, right?

Baby shouldn't be breathing in that stuff at that age, and there is no reason to do that! That is ridiculous.  My daughter is almost 2 years old and we still haven't painted her nails.  Plus, pretty soon her hands are going to find her mouth, and she will be putting that stuff in her mouth, so keeping them out while it dries will be tricky, and then if she scrapes it off once she has teeth and swallows it.  That is just ignorant.|`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	She's 2 weeks old. Of course she gonna keep balling up her hands. My son keeps doing that when I try to cut his nails.

How old are you? Think about your baby's health before you try to pretty her up at 2 weeks. You shouldn't even have that nail polish open in the same room with her....the smell is so strong. You need to leave her nails alone..and let them grow healthy...not contaminate them with that stuff.|`|VueZ5u9Waa	You're ridiculous! Don't paint your 2 week old's fingers! I HOPE you're kidding.

Don't do it.|`|KcWptsAuaa	first of all that's a reflex which won't leave for some time so there's no stopping it. second and more importantly i just wouldn't if i were you! nail polish has been known to contain lead. and babies put fingers in the mouth, the paint chips...you get the picture. no offense but she isn't a dress up doll.|`|4JgSq2rlaa	hello shes 2 weeks old who ru trying to impress grow up id expect thatr form a bloody 3 yr old|`|bIFIxh3Waa	Is this a joke!?!|`|hTQg5tgPaa	You should not put nail polish on your child!!! who knows what kind of chemicals are in it... wow, I was feeling guilty for being in the same room as a manicurist while I was pregnant (eventually left cause it was too strong fumes in the room).  Every child keeps their hands in fists while they are young by the way... not much you can do about it.      DON'T YOU THINK THAT HER HANDS ARE JUST PERFECT THEY WAY THEY ARE WITHOUT THE POLISH.  If I were you I wouldn't cheapen the baby by putting polish on her nails... takes some of her innocence away.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I wouldn't paint her nails at that age, its not a good idea|`|955YoHvVaa	If you insist on painting someones finger nails paint your own..I painted my daughters toenails when she was 7 months old and even then it was too much of a hassle and not worth it...|`|waU776uwaa	She's 2 weeks old, she doesn't need to get her fingernails painted.

You should know that nail polish has chemicals and babies put their hands in their mouths and they can get sick.|`|oIMWvs7Qaa	WOW...i have nothing to say to you...your stupidity makes me sick...do you know how bad that is for a baby that young to be breathing that stuff...    and as for the person that said you should just slap her hand should not be allowed to have kids!!! SHES TWO WEEKS OLD      WTF is wrong with you????|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Is this a serious question?    That would rank up there if I was posting a question "I am trying to give my 8 month old a perm and he won't hold still... how can I get him to hold still?" Sounds silly doesn't it?
b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	hey girly?!? Yes sometimes our mind does play tricks on us. I wanted to be pregnant sooooo bad that every month i was convinced i had symptoms only to get let down by evil aunt flow. Now with that being said u very well could be pregnant but if u are u usually dont experience nausea this early. its hard to tell. Im pregnant now and didnt have any signs at all. In fact I had my period and eveything but a blood test yesterday confirmed Im pregnant. Everyone is different. I wish u the very very best and i hope u are sick cause ur pregnant as funny as that sounds :)|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	It's really too soon to feel symptoms.  It actually takes approx 8 days for a fertilized egg to travel down the fallopian tubes, into the uterus, and implant.  You definitely won't feel any symptoms before that.  Even after that point, it's usually weeks before you would start to feel any real symptoms.|`|6GIp6pM3aa	Sounds like your trying to hard. I hate that we can trick our bodies into thinking we are pregnant. On the other hand..ya never know!!! Gotta wait just a little longer then you can test! Good Luck to you!
zK1V9Mu7aa	I felt fine. I was only in hospital because my waters had broken for longer than 24 hours so they wanted to induce me later on that day. 2 hours later after being admitted I had my son naturally. Honestly, I felt fine and was devastated at the thought of having to be induced - but luckily my son had other ideas.  I had different dates as well that differed by a week. My first was given to me at my dating scan which was Jan 4th and the date I worked out was Jan 11th - he ended up coming on the date I had worked out.  Hope this helps  xxx|`|Hhifw93laa	i had 2 of mine at 36 weeks 1 at 37 weeks and 1 at 41 weeks so it differs on the baby when he or she is willing to come out and say hi good luck and God Bless|`|aLkCxq5aaa	Ha! Snap!    I feel exactly the same really.  Apart from early physio for S.P.D. I've had a pretty good time, especially compared to my 2nd pregnancy, where I was miserable pretty much the whole time because of SPD where I couldn't walk, dress, drive etc..  My 1st pregnancy went fine, no probs, went into labour 10 days overdue, got to the hospital with pretty bad contractions to find I was 1cm dilated.  I was put on the ante natal ward and told to get some sleep.  SLEEP?!! I was walking the corridors by myself in agony because the 4 midwives on duty thought I was overreacting, thought they had a drama queen on their hands!  An HOUR later I was almost fainting with the pain so I was checked again to be told I was fully dilated! So from start to finish my labour lasted 6 hours and had a gorgeous baby boy who weighed in at 9lbs! No stitches and only gas and air.  My second, as I mentioned wasn't very pleasant because of the SPD.  I seemed to be in pain day and night from start to finish.  Had terrible morning sickness most of the time, spotty skin, big sore boobs, greasy hair and was a lot moodier than I can ever remember being with my 1st!!  Also put a lot of weight on and felt really uncomfortable!  Grace was then born weighing 8lbs 3oz 2 days after after I'd asked for a sweep on the day I was due because I was so fed up.  Labour seemed a lot more painful and found out why when her head popped out looking up at me!! Had no idea she was back to back so it was a bit like "ooh , hello!"  Had gas and air and a shot of pethadine, which I'd never have again as it just made me drowsy without the relief!  I am now 37 weeks + with my 3rd and it seems to have flown by! No real problems, only seen the midwife a total of 5 times during my whole pregnancy, don't feel heavy or uncomfortable, getting more sleep than I ever got with the other two, and you can only tell I'm pregnant when I turn to the side!  I just hope the labour and birth goes as smoothly!! I'm now getting to the point where I'm getting impatient and question every little twinge or ache, thinking this could be it, today's the day! I hope I don't go over this time and I'd like my waters to go on their own so I can get excited. I just want a sign now that the birth is iminent!!  Hope all goes well for you, take care xx|`|AA12279950	With my son I was induced - so you don't want to know about that!  With my daughter - she came three weeks early.  And because I'd only experienced an induced labour before, I had no idea I was in labour.  I just felt slightly 'odd'!  Was speaking to a friend who said, "bet you're in labour"  She was right!  I had the easiest pregnancies ever - both of them.  But both ended in emergency c-sections so I hope you're a little more fortunate than me.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hey i was the same with my first and i felt normal till 38 weeks when i got a urine infection which started my labour and i dilated 1 cm in 3 days then the contractions stopped. luckily i was given anti-biotics. at 39 wks 1 day after it cleared up istarted feeling restless and could not sit down i had to pace the carpet for 2 days until at 39 wks and 3 days my baby boy decided he wanted out. you should feel different most women do but maybe you wont feel anything till labour starts. good luck.|`|KV7OGaJbaa	Haha, my labour stories are most uneventful! I was induced with both boys, after a terrible end to both pregnancies. Was so fed up, sore everywhere, wasn't getting any sleep. Just generally felt horrid from about 38 weeks. With my first, I was induced at 11 days overdue, had a very long, hard labour (even took an epidural when I swore I wouldn't). It was a horrible experience. I had to go to theatre after giving birth as some of the placenta was left in the womb. I lost alot of blood (but was given no transfusion) and baby wasn't too well either. He ended up on antibiotics and we got home 10 days later! My second time, I was induced at 42 weeks exactly. Was in labour for 6 hours, no pain releif and managed to keep moving around until I was ready to deliver. We got home that day! Baby had a bit of an eye infection but what a difference second time around. Am I mad to be trying again? Haha! I hope I cured your boredom for a few mins, and best wishes for the future. I look forward to hear about your labour and your little bundle!|`|BQYXgtq7aa	I can absolutely understand! I developed pre eclampsia at around 32 weeks. It got so bad that I was eventually hospitalised and they tried to induce me (but ti failed). I was transferred to another hospital where I waited it out another few days before being induced again. I tell you, I walked miles around the 2nd hospital leading up to the inducement. I felt fine, but I was nearly double my weight due to fluid retention!  I had been in labour for 8 days by the time I was successfully induced... It just wouldnt progress! I ended up with an epidural for pain relief, a forceps delivery (cos I'd been pushing for 4 hours after nearly 10 hours of full on labour - my little boy turned his head - he was not keen on coming out!!) I also had an episiotomy.    So I had a crappy end to my pregnancy, however, it was pretty good until around 32 weeks. Oh I gave birth at 38 wks, baby boy, 8lb 14oz or 4020g, 51cm length and 34cm head circumference. My mum was there to watch him be born and cut his cord. It was truly magical (despite all the fear, sickness and pain I experienced - I nearly died giving birth). He is now nearly 14 months old.    You are very lucky to have had such a great pregnancy and I truly hope it all goes to plan for you and your baby girl. Be patient. Good things come to those who wait :-)    Good luck, all the best :-) enjoy your quiet time and having your baby only for you (kicking inside) :-)|`|ZTb7O6VJaa	Well I had my daughter at 39 wks and I didn't even know I was in labor... I started having contractions and went to the hospital because I felt really uncomfortable and was told that my water had been broken for about 24-36 hours... So they put me on pit and I had her within 10 hours of feeling the 1st contraction...     With my son... My cat was on my lap... Well my belly... lol... And he got up and moved to my husband's lap and about 15 minutes later I felt my first big painful contraction and told my husband we had to go to the hospital... I had him 9 hours after the first contraction...     I am currently on my 3rd pregnancy... And am 37 weeks and 5 days... I have been having contractions on and off over the last week and am dilated to 2.5 and 50% effaced... The Dr told me if I really wanted to get started into labor to go walk (which I have been doing a lot since I have a 4 and 3 y/o to chase after... Lol) I am thinking about doing what he said and go walk circuts around the mall in town... Its an itty bitty mall so I should be good... Hope that helps... I really know how frustrating it can be to want to not be pregnant and still have a while to go...
kprKXEOSaa	I took both fenugreek and blessed thistle, at the same time.  Make sure you're taking enough, for example two capsules three times a day, or whatever the recommended dose is on the bottle.  The only negative side effect of the fenugreek, that I know of, is that your urine and sweat smells like maple syrup, and the breastmilk probably does too.  But it doesn't harm the baby.    You also need to make sure you're drinking lots of pure water.  When I was breastfeeding last time, I would drink 16 oz of water every time I nursed my baby, during the day.  It came out to about twice as much water as I usually need.  Also make sure you're eating enough healthy calories, you can't low-calorie diet and produce good breastmilk.  You can't explain to your body, this 1000 calories is for me, that 300 calories is for the baby.  A nursing mom could easily need 3500 - 4000 calories a day!  But that's not cake and pie, it's plenty of vegetables, whole grain, lean meat and dairy and fruit.  If your'e hungry, your baby is too.  Good luck!|`|zQWNb6neaa	My 4 week old just spent a week in the hospital due to RSV and the stress of the situation and the lack of sleep significantly decreased my milk supply. I started drinking Mother's Milk Tea (it contains Fenugreek and Blessed Thistle) and it really helped boost my supply. I highly recommend it.|`|oDyNiJi7aa	I did try a tea called mother's milk and yes it did help.  It will also depend if you are stressed out.  That was one of my problems.  ~I wish you the best of luck!

6GIp6pM3aa	I think if it continues to go up then you may have been successful...
baxhcxOeaa	hi :) Well, you could be pregnant, it's very possible...but many things can stop your period such as stress, illness or the fact that you are thinking a lot about pregnancy...the body is a strange thing and if you're, for example, overly worried or excited about something you're period can get all mixed up. Hopefully, as you've been trying to conceive, you actually are pregnant but my advice would be to go and see your doctor as soon as you can. It's good to rule out any other possibilities and he/she can do a pregnancy test with you. It's also vital to see your doctor asap if you are pregnant just to get the best advice possible and to have a general health check up. This will stop you worrying too :) and yes the symptoms you describe can be signs of pregnancy but they can also be signs of a bug or of worry! other early pregnancy symptoms are sore or sensitive breasts, feeling more tired, going to the toilet more (peeing more frequently), and maybe the area around your nipples (the areola) has become darker in colour.     I wish you all the best with this and hopefully you are pregnant, if not keep trying and you'll get there, if you are congratulations and enjoy your pregnancy and being a mum for the 1st time :) x|`|IWinNj2saa	Go buy a test. You won't know until you test. Good Luck|`|CUYuAGF5aa	The symptoms you have can be linked to both periods and pregnancy so the best thing to do would be to get yourself a test to be sure.

x8JRkRNkaa	Bleeding is usually a sign that you're not pregnant. It could also be an early loss. A lot of pregnancies end up in loss before the mother even knows she is pregnant. That could be the case. Without knowing when your last period was it's hard to say where a bouts you would be, and if it's likely or not that you're pregnant.|`|YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Go to the doctor, take a test, or do some research.

Someone said I should put my baby into a commerical or modeling, and I would never do that! My daughter is beautiful but I could never A) use her to gain money, or to fillfull my dreams, or B) allow my daughter to wear any make-up before she is 13 years old. Kids do not need make-up. This is a sad world to allow such a thing.|`|Hhifw93laa	i feel the same way but some parents don't feel that way they think its ok i personally think it should be illegal|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Yeah, its pretty disturbing.

yrDqtazLaa	Ectopic pregnancies happen when the egg implants in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus (the egg gets fertilized in the tube, and instead of the egg traveling down to the uterus where it's supposed to implant, it stays in the tube and implants there). You'll feel a LOT of pain on one side where the tube and ovary is, it would have you in tears. Loss of apetite happens a lot in early pregnancy, it's nothing to be concerned about at this point. Spotting is normal, brown means "old blood", so it's left over from your last period, and is just cleaning itself out. It's normal and nothing to worry about. You have no symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy right now, you seem normal thus far. Good luck and congrats!|`|pISC6pphaa	I had an ectopic pregnancy this last summer.  At first, everything seemed normal, but I had a bit of bleeding, sick to my stomach one day.  Pregnancy test was positive, and I was nauseous thinking about oysters, etc.      After a couple weeks, there was one night that I had severe nausea, diarrhea, and I felt really dizzy.  I thought I was going to pass out, maybe even die.  I felt a little better, and went to bed, but downstairs close to the bathroom.    That night, I woke up screaming, with the worst pain I had ever had.  I went to the doctor, and he thought it was gall bladder.  Several hours later, I had an ultrasound, and they found there was no baby in my uterus. It was on one of the tubes, and the tubes had burst.  The awful pain was from the blood pushing on my diaphragm..    I don't want to be graphic, but if you are having pain, esp if it is getting worse or on one side coming in waves, you should at least call the doctor now.  The only way to know it's ectopic is to look for the baby in the uterus (ultra sound).  Ectopic can be life-threatening.    I hope you're just being overworried, but good luck to you, and take care of yourself!
ZZzQLjaKaa	As a teacher myself, I am the last one to ever point a finger at a teacher. It is hard for the teacher to be this honest with you, because we know these are not the things parents want to hear about their kiddos. That being said, it sounds like your child is not getting that warm fuzzy feeling from her teacher. Most kids need to feel love and accepted before they will perform for a teacher. It is possible your daughter has not achieved this connection with her teacher. I would evaluate some other things first, your daughters nutrition and sleep habits, and then I would ask to go meet with the teacher again. I would very honestly, and tactfully confide in her that you are concerned that your daughter is unhappy at school, and ask her to make a special effort with your daughter. Could the she have a job in the class if she hasnt already? Most teachers should know how to create a bond with a child if that is lacking. If your child's teacher seems unresponsive, involve the principal. Do not "wait and see" the school year is half over and you need immediate action.|`|kOr0C4Cvaa	Maybe hidden camera!|`|KRqz1dOcaa	make sure she has a proper healthy breakfast and check that she is eating her lunch at school.  she might not have enough energy to concentrate.  when you are working with her at home i'm sure she is well fed but you never know what happens with her eating at school.    maybe she is finding the work to easy (or hard, but by her grades i doubt that) and her mind is wandering.|`|d1wXxd9paa	There are many options for you to consider and look at.  The first be.. depending on where you live go directly to the school board and ask for entire school curriculum for the year.  That way you know what's coming she knows and you can be prepared for things that she may find difficult.  Also talk to your paediatrician, some kids need help in certain areas.  I have a developmentally disabled daughter (not severe by any means) but does have difficulties with some aspects of school and tunes out on those days.  Also go over the curriculum WITH the teacher and have a parent teacher interview if your schedule allows on a weekly basis and get progress notes.  Hope this helps!!|`|RIVywiykaa	She may be smarter then you think or need glasses|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Have her tested for dyspraxia, it's a dyslexia like condition.     I suffer asperger's, dyspraxia, OCD and exophoria, so I'm no stranger to this.|`|Elxuvon8aa	see if you can get her changed if there is another class fo her age It might just be a child teacher conflict not everyone gets along with everyone. and if she is feeling badly it is time to stand up to the school district  stand behind her|`|2cstdEkIaa	go to class for a few days with her and monitor it for yourself|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Your daughter could be bored with what is being taught at school, or because its all verbal and no hands on. You could take your daughter to get checked to see if she is on mark with other children her age if she tests higher or lower than other children her age. If she tests higher give her something more challenging to do.       My cousin almost flunked out of first grade because he did the same thing. He ended up skipping 2nd grade, and 4th grade.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	It sounds like the teacher..I have seen this many times..I have three daughters 25,15, 13..so have had a lot of experience with poor teachers over the years. Too bad that she has to go through this at such a young age. I would suggest you go to the school and talk with the teacher with your daughter. Tell her what you have said here, and how your daughter feels and see if anything becomes of this. Ask your daughter exactly how she feels about her teacher..and let her know she can say however she feels and you are not going to get upset about it..she might feel intimidated by the teacher, or there might be a personality clash..of course the teacher should be able to handle this..then once armed with her feelings, go to the teacher. Good luck and I hope this does not turn your daughter off school.
6GIp6pM3aa	I think your chances are pretty good, but you are at the waiting game (I hate this part!) I feel your pain, I am recovering from an ectopic pregnancy as we speak.

kprKXEOSaa	I hear what you're saying, the car seats are convenient but heavy and bulky.  I got so I would put my arm through the car seat handle, like carrying a basket, rather than carrying it with my hand.      But, yes, you can carry your baby around.  If you have a lot of bags, it might be awkward.  I would definitely recommend not carrying both a purse and a diaper bag, combine them into one bag.  The other nice thing about the car seat is that the baby is buckled in, they can squirm away from you otherwise, especially if you've got him bundled up in a lot of blankets.      I got one of those $12 umbrella strollers at WalMart, and though it isn't the nicest stroller out there (far from it) it folds up small and gets the job done.  We'll sometimes keep it in the trunk, just in case we need it, and it has come in handy many times.     Good luck!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Its completely fine to carry your baby.  Carseats are heavy and bulky and ifficult to carry.  Your baby will probably be more comfortable and feel more safe and secure being carried next to you anyway.    Perhaps look at a second hand store for a sling or carrier and carry him.  Good luck!    If he is still working on head control, a sling would work best.    Perhaps you could even try making your own wrap to carry your son, similar to this one.     http://www.mobywrap.com/t-instructions-H...|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Go onto FREECYCLE   people gives stuff away on there...google FREECYCLE and the name of your town...you can pick strollers up for 20 dollars second hand...gosh if I lived near you I would give you one! You should ask your local church for help...I feel for you....you need a stroller as the baby gets heavier. I'll put a little wish out there that someone will give you one...x|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	You could get a sling or a carrier thing (like Baby Bjorn). They have others that aren't so expensive. That way you have your hands free and they are still close to you. I don't mind carrying them when they're small, but your arms do get tired after awhile.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	That is entirely up to you hun, the only downside is that you wont be able to set him down  and may have to hold him for extended periods of time, which is rough on your back and so forth, but if this isnt an issue then go for it :0)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	There is nothing more painful and awkward that hauling a baby around in a car seat.  I've only done it a few times, and it really is the worst possible way to carry a baby.    How about investing in a wrap?  They are a lot cheaper than strollers, you can frequently find them used, and then you could have your hands free when you needed them.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	it wont harm the baby to carry him around.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	no everyone has an infant carrier car seat- you'll be fine. you don't have to carry him around in that. if he gets sleepy and you want to give your arms a break then you can let him rest in your lap- better yet, why dont you get a sling or something?|`|TqOdbhNAaa	As long as it's not a strain on you, there's nothing wrong with carrying him around.  Do what's comfortable for you and your baby!|`|4JgSq2rlaa	wot do u mean u can afford a pushchair there r sooooooo many out there that r under 50 if ur that stingy forget u being tired think anout ur childs safety if u decide to lose ur balance and land on him then wot!!!!!!!!!! think properly also if u can afford to provide properly for the child why on earth have one i feel so sorry for the kid|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	you could always get a sling and wear him|`|FmC1TGm5aa	Have you tried wrapping/wearing him or using a baby carrier? That's what I do and I love it! Sometimes I carry her, but my arms get tired and it's harder to do things. I got a baby bjorn used off of craigslist for $30 and it's been a lifesaver! I also got a moby wrap from a friend who didn't need hers.     Have you checked Craigslist.com? You could even post your situation and ask for people's baby things that they're getting rid of for free. Lot's of people will be happy to unload their unused old stuff, and help someone out.     I don't use a stroller, because they're bulky. But I love the Baby Bjorn and hope you can find a used one like I did!|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	No there is nothing wrong with carrying a baby with out a car sear or stroller. But you could check Craig's list or free cyclers for a stroller or a sling / snuggle carrier for free or cheap.  If you have to walk allot it would be better to get a sling or stroller.    I know that if I walked 2 hours I would need to go to the washroom and I would not want to lay a baby on the floor of a public washroom. and I know that carrying a baby around for a long time even a new born  can cause your back to hurt and arms    I don't mean to sound rude when I say this but you say you would only use it twice a month are you not going to take baby out any other time like just a walk or shopping?  What happens when baby gets squirmy and to heavy to carry for long periods of time? If you had a stroller that reclines you could use it till baby is 2-4 years old.|`|jVhWIDRnaa	I don't think there is a "wrong" or "right" answer to this question. We carry my daughter because she hates her carseat. She is little enough still that its MUCH easier to carry her than the carseat.     Plus, she is nosey...:)|`|955YoHvVaa	I always left my daughters carseat in the car when going to doctors appointments..it was easier to carry her and I didn't have the extra weight from the seat and my daughter always cried to get out of her seat so no point in lugging it around when she would just want to be held anyway..I see absolutely nothing wrong with it..|`|DDSEGWFDaa	I carried my babies a lot because they were big and it seemed like the car seat just added weight.  He will love to be carried too.  But don't bundle him up so much, he doesn't need it and once you're inside he'll be way too hot.|`|VTB5QpyBaa	No there is nothing wrong with carrying him in without a car seat or stroller. I think as long as you bundle in with a hat and blanket, he will be fine. The only thing is like you said it is convenient to set him down in the car seat, especially in the doctors office. Good luck at the appointment =)|`|VXhOLgDEaa	haha...I think I know how you feel. When my daughter was a newborn...it was weird carrying the carseat or taking the stroller around. It was weird and awkward. It's okay if you want to carry him..its all up to you...how you're comfortable and what's convenient for you. I used to carry my daughter around...even at the mall with my husband! But yes..the whole carseat thing is just going to get to you more...because it its hurting you that bad already...once he's older and heavier....it sucks!!! I hate carrying carseats! They should be just left in the car!|`|Qe9FmH8raa	I see nothing wrong with carrying him around, it's your baby. Most babies would rather be held anyway. Another option is to look into a sling or wrap baby carrier. They are very comfy to wear, leave you hands free and can be fairly inexpensive.|`|Ks7lENScaa	If you dont mind carrying him in your arms.  I know my arms get tired.  I love having the car seat and/or the stroller with me.  You could get one of those carriers that you can place in front of you when you get tired of holding him in your arms.
Vk4mZi5Yaa	I think they are both beautiful names (& i really do think that im not just saying it to get a best answer lol) I especially like amy-leigh, very pretty! x|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love them!!! But I prefer the name Emily!|`|TRkpG3MPaa	I like them both. they are pretty names.|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	I like Amy and I like Leigh but i really am not keen on hyphenated first names.    Hayden Paul is good too!|`|olF9Hl6saa	Amy-leigh is beautiful. Another compromise for Emily could be Emaleigh?     Hayden Paul is nice too... but I know two little girls named Hayden.|`|Org2hdfUaa	Amy-Leigh is very common. Maybe Emilia-Leigh instead? (Em-eel-e-ya)    I don't like Hayden as a name at all. Firstly because I live near a hotel called 'Haydens' and secondly it is like an attepmt an making Aidan more unique!     Aidan Paul is far better!|`|YseGAHIfaa	those are nice names! if you really like them then call ur son/daughter those! x|`|bwyBXDMHaa	I don't like Hayden Paul, it sounds like an old man not a little kid! I like amy, but the middle name doesn't really go|`|Z8jKYm8baa	i think amy-leigh is a really cute name, but i don't like hayden paul as they don't really go together but i love the name hayden. do you have any others that will go with hayden?        http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|ZtaEg6mZaa	personally I think there cute|`|zMNgG9m0aa	the real problem is that everyone calls them "baby names' when in fact your child will only be a baby for 12 months!!  Perhaps if you viewed this whole process with the idea of "adult names" you might make a good decision.    but while I'm here... quite like Hayden for a boy. Amy-leigh is also pretty but i think those kind of hyphenated names can be a trashy? (or were popularized by white trash type ppl?) not that i'm saying anything about your good self :) and perhaps the tide has turned and you can lead the charge by bringing these double barrelled first names into the norm again.    good luck with it all.|`|9CAXUgOZaa	lol, I've never seen anyone get annoyed about people asking opinions on baby names.    They're both cute names :)    But I like Amy-Lee better.     Congratulations btw|`|ZZHvaCSBaa	I love Amy - Lee spelt like that is nice not sure about the boys name|`|3qa3BftUaa	Both nice names. Good choice|`|pAEkqyCOaa	Amy is beautiful...but I think that "Guido" will be a beautiful name for your future boy...Beacause "Guido" is my name :P (Italian name)|`|rG7URScVaa	I love the name Hayden and I thought that it was a girls name but thinking about it I think it sounds quite cute.     Amy-Leigh I think is dead cute too....and I prefer it too the "Amy-Lee" spelling    xxxx
AA10730513	I am on your side with this one. Although, I think maybe up to 2 hours a day of tv is ok. When my daughter was about your daughter's age, we would watch Sesame Street off and on while we played. Her dad thought I was crazy for taking her to the other room when he watched grownup shows. And I would sometimes put her where the tv could offer a little entertainment while I did a little housework. But half the time she would be over at the baby gate excitedly watching me sweep the floor or fix dinner.     As she got older, we had movies on long car rides. By the time she was 3, she LOVED to watch and attempt to do yoga. She wanted to be just like "the predy yogurt lady". She would also watch a little tv with my grandfather and part of a movie in the afternoon. ... Other than that, she was busy playing with the dogs and cats and her toys and me.     Now my daughter is 6 years old. Watching tv is one of her favorite activities when she goes to visit Granny, although it's more like she is in the floor doing crafts while the tv is on in the background. Some nights she doesn't even ask to turn the tv on at home. But she usually does have PBS or Disney on in the mornings until I get breakfast on the table.     I will tell you one thing I have noticed. I know some people who used the tv a lot on their babies / kids. As a result, some of them cuss as much as a grownup and know about things they really shouldn't. (Imagine what it's like to have a 7 year old tell you all about rape and how she doesn't like certain men in the neighborhood because they might rape her if they ever got to be alone with her.) And ALL of these parents are at a loss for how I can just turn on the radio and put my kid to bed at 7:45 when their same age kids can't fall asleep past 10pm. The poor things just have to lay in bed bored, watching tv.     There are my views on the subject. ... Hopefully your partner will understand soon that too much tv can be a bad thing. ... Some kids don't really pay attention to the tv and having it on with them in the house is fine. But it sounds like your daughter is very interested in absorbing whatever information it may give her.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I think the rule is that no child under 2 years of age should be watching any tv all, not even ten minutes a day. But do what works for you.    If your husband insists on keeping the tv on, have your child play in another room. Or send your husband to the bedroom to watch tv.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	My goodness ! LOL ! I grew up in front of a tv, went to College and graduated ! I'm a mother myself and while I was cleaning the house and the kids were in the walker, they were entertained by the "Bear in the Big Blue house" ! Today, both of the children, hardly watch tv, are good in school and one is 7 and the girl is 9 years old. How much tv did you watch as a child, how did it damage or not to your mental health? I think parents nowadays, want to be too much of a Psychologists when it comes to their children !|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	Television is used by far to many people as a placebo against actual interaction with their child.    The fact that you are having this issue come up so early means that TV has already had a bad effect on your child.    Continuous noise creates confusion in the mind. Everyone needs some quiet time where there are no electronic distractions to prevent them from enjoying 'down time'.    The wired generation has become accustomed to noise 24-7, but it is not healthy.    Limit television exposure to 30 minutes or less.    Your child needs the development and the rest from the noise.    There is no reason why your baby can't sit in her playpen or swing while you eat and between bites of food, you can talk with her, tell her what you are eating, etc. That would be far more stimulating to her development than the crap on TV.    Babies need to have emotional outlets and opportunities to interact with more than a remote control!    Take her out in her stroller. Walk around in stores with her and talk to her about the things that are there. You need not buy her a thing. Go to museums. Most communities have one or there are some nearby.    Children need exposure to real life opportunities, not just cartoons and news shows.|`|59GymH27aa	My little girl watches Cbeebies quite a lot and we also sit with her at the PC and go on the website.  Shes 1 and she just loves watching them.  I don't think that watching Cbeebies is bad at all because she is learning and I think they are educational and fun.
9P26sacKaa	Yes, you could be pregnant again.  You should probably take a HPT to check and if it comes back negative, you might want to get a blood test to see.  It might be too early for a HPT to recognize a pregnancy.      I did want to mention that the spotting is not normal postpartum stuff.  All of your PP bleeding should have stopped completely by 6 weeks.  If it were a period, it would have been a normal period, like before you had the baby.  It could have been implantation bleeding, bleeding from rough sex, or from something else altogether.    However, it's actually a myth that a woman is MORE likely to get pregnant after birthing.  Women who are breastfeedingly their babies throughout the day and night and are not giving any supplements at all are much LESS likely to get pregnant after birth than at any other time.  Because so many women are either supplementing or only feeding formula nowadays, many women get pregnant after birth just like they would any other time.  Obviously, solely breastfeeding doesn't guarantee that your fertility is reduced, but for most breastfeeding women, it is.    Oh, and it probably wasn't stupid that you had sex 4 weeks PP (except that you didn't want to get pregnant), especially if all of your bleeding/discharge from birth had stopped completely.  My midwife had told me that I could have sex at 6 weeks or a week after bleeding had stopped, whichever came first.  Some women only bleed for a week after birth, which would mean they could have sex 2 weeks PP.  It's all about letting your body heal so there isn't a chance of infection from sex.|`|nFzqGWBDaa	i got a 3 yr old, 9 month old and i'm 5 months pregnant. it could be possible. i'd go ahead and take a test.|`|4QSsJ23Caa	I would just buy the test now, to put ur mind at ease.  if your not late on ur period then i'd wait to see.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Unfortunately, with this situation, you may not get your period again and since you just had a baby and your cycle is not regular yet, you cant tell when you ovulated. I think you may need to head in and get a blood test, it is the only 100% accurate thing for you now.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	I would wait a few weeks.  I am pretty sure I bled off and on for at least 10 weeks after giving birth.  Spotting is normal, as your body re-adjusts and heals.|`|N6vEZVNEaa	I had my first child 4 months ago and now i am 2 months pregnant again so it is a possibility|`|NI8D46J0aa	I never spotted. But then again, I have never had implantation bIeeding, either.  If I were you, I would get a test just to be sure. Are you having any other symptoms? Good luck!|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	u need to test now.  I'm in the same boat.  I had a little girl in April 2008 and i got pregnant again in August 2008 with a boy.  Now my little girl is 9 months and I'm 28 wks 1 day pregnant with my son.  It can happen
vue9NOhYaa	It doesn't matter when your LAST period was. What matters is when your NEXT period would have come if you hadn't gotten pregnant.  You don't ovulate 14 days after your last period (as some here will claim) but about 14 days before your NEXT period would be due.  So, you had a long cycle last month, and ovulated a bit later than expected .. probably around the 16th or 17th.  And you conceived.      Congratulations.
yrDqtazLaa	A full bladder makes it easier for the technician to see the baby in there.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I haven't been told to do so during either of my pregnancies...with technology today I am not so sure it is necessary to see the baby cause We seen both of our babies quite well|`|gx4s68s8aa	Honestly I don't know-  I keep hearing woman needing to have a full bladder and I have never been told to do so.  I have had ultrasounds quite often since I am high risk.  And not once (even at 8 weeks) did they tell me to have a full bladder.  It might be the quality of the machines that are in some doctor's offices.  Perhaps the newer ones don't need you to have a full bladder.  Maybe it is just to make it a bit easier for the tech or doctor to see.  But I have had at least a 12 or more ultrasounds with my two pregnancies combined thus far and never had to have a full bladder.|`|AA12380496	The fluid make it easier for them to see the baby & makes the baby more active during the viewing of the sonogram.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I was never told i needed a full bladder for my u/s.  I had the u/s at 20 weeks and they didn't have any problems seeing the fetus.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I only had a full bladder once and I did a lot of u/s. It just makes it a bit easier to see the baby but it really doesn't have to be full. If for some reason it does they will give you water to fill it up.|`|9op65iQVaa	it's always been that way.  You must be in your first tri mester.|`|cjqOUq5xaa	I thought that you did-I remember them telling me with my first pregnancy that I did-but I just had one last week and had a full bladder and the tech said that you don't need one for any sonogram anymore?? So I don't know! But I think the reasoning behind it is so that it will push the baby closer so they can get a better look??|`|4QSsJ23Caa	yep it is alot easier to see the baby.  you would think they would have come up w/ something different.  I have had 2 pregnancies and to hold your urine for that long is like torture.|`|hNiKE6Ptaa	so the ultrasound waves have something to bounce off of.  if you dont have a full bladder the ultrasound tech will have a hard time seeing baby and measureing.  i know cuz i purposly didnt have a full bladder at one of my ultrasounds cuz i was in preterm labor controlled on medication and having a full bladder causes contractions (which i was already having a hard time controlling) so i didnt want to take the risk of additional contractions.  the tech had a really hard time measuring.|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	i have no idea,i actually read some where that you dont need a full bladder because the baby is surrounded by fluid.  but still the ultrasound tech always tell me to have a full bladder.|`|fHgbL046aa	Its easy for the technician to see the baby.   For my  first ultrasound I was only 9 weeks and because my uterus was tilted she wanted to do a vaginal ultrasound, but I said no. She just did the regular one. The second ultrasound she needed me to empty my bladder cause she had trouble seeing anything.|`|AA10976951	I was told to have a full bladder at my ultrasound a couple weeks ago and it didn't work so well.  My baby likes her space and any pressure at all and she gets as far from it as possible.  The tech said that sometimes the full bladder works against her so she kept sending me to the bath room to release a little here and a little there.  That was worse torture than having to hold a full bladder!    I didn't have to have a full bladder at my first two and I am having another ultrasound next week because my baby girl wouldn't cooperate :) they didn't say anything about me needing a full bladder for that one!|`|gaiCNtEFaa	It is because a full bladder helps push the uterus up and makes it more accessible.   Your second one will be like that also.  If you have to have one in your 3rd tri you wont need to drink a gallon of water.
FiUprYsvaa	It does sound like foster care would be better.   You probably would be able to see your friends and go places and hang out with your friends.   But then again I don't really know, just look into it.|`|ReH5EoR0aa	Most likely, not.   Depends on who the Foster parents are and how old you are.  Some parents are very cool and others are not.      That would also put you into a situation of being "owned" by the system.   They would evaluate you and decide for you what they think you need, and force you to do it or not do it.    You are better off making your own decisions as long as they have good survival value.|`|C8opQMAVaa	foster homes are rather strict. theyre dealing with a group of kids, and they dont have enough time to take each one every where and pick them up so it would be more of an at school only thing, so it would be like you have a girlfriend at school but at home your single, i dated a guy in a foster home once, and thats exactly how it was, he was not even allowed to talk on the phone, needless to say that one didnt work out.|`|AtDlNnIBaa	humm i think you need to stay at home and sort it out. getting social services involved can course allot of problems.|`|5UoLngxfaa	probley not trust me i was in foster care for 4 years and never once got to go hang out with friends and i was a good kid
9Ycuoysjaa	You maybe suffering from stress or maybe you could be pregnant, or depending on your age your breast may still be growing. The only way to find out is by taking a pregnancy test and when you get your results think about what you want to do with them, just remember if you are pregnant everyone is scared at first but 9 months later when you see that litle face you will be as happy as ever. On the other-hand if its negative then you can plan for children in the furture just like you want. good luck and hopefully you get the results you want.xx|`|ISHVxChyaa	The breast being tender and sore was my Sure fire sign I had the bun in the oven. Both times. I thought with my son that I was Dieing cause I had an IUD and was not suppose to get knocked up for 10 years and it happened in 3 years so Birth control methods are not always fool proof!     I would like to say Nahh your not Pregnant but the things you are saying are really pointing that direction! I would not DRINK any more it will just make you sicker and the red spots on your face could be acme or busted blood vessels from the puking     A sign to KNOW before you get the test and it does not always happen but a way to check is Pinch your nipple and if theres something at you have never seen come out then I would SAY YES! You kidda have to squeeze hard and pull behind the dark area some Dr do this to see if you have Milk coming in yet!     The best thing for the breast tenderness is heat packs like Hot Hands in your bra that helps a lot!!!!!!
SlBsJ3NRaa	Yes, it's true. It's through the welfare office. If you are involved in a work or school program, are single, or if your husband/boyfriend is also in a work or school program, the state will pay so much for daycare, regardless who provides it. But, if you are with someone who is unemployed and not in school, they will not provide it because they consider the baby's father responsible as well. The state will also want you to pay so much to the person sitting for you. Not a lot, because the state will pay a big chunk, but a percentage of it is supposed to be paid by you. Call your local welfare office and make an appointment to see if you qualify.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	If your local Social Services or Human Services offers Childcare assistance, yes this 'could' happen.  You would have to go thru an interview, be approved for child care assistance, wait on the waiting list.  Then your family member would have to be certified and approved by your local Social Services child care department.  Then at that point, yes, it could happen.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Right......highly doubtful.    Wow, I had no idea that was possible!|`|zd6lRfIXaa	Yes, if you are low income. They would have to call the Department of Job and Family Services for your county for more info. You may have to pay a small percentage of the bill. They will also have to have a house that meets all the requirements. Call Job and Family Services for more info.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	ive got news for you guys,  it IS true, you can have your mom or other family member state certified to watch children and the dhhr will pay them just as they would pay anyone else as long as you qualify for child care. the relative goes through the same certifications as any home based child care worker would and then the state pays them to watch your child.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	In PA, it's called Subsidized Day Care and yes they will pay a certain amount per child per day for either a daycare provider or family member/friend to watch your child(ren). There is a long waiting list usually for these services. You will have a co-pay. You must be considered low-income for your family size. Check with your local Dept. of Welfare for income guidelines.    My SIL has used it & is currently back on the waiting list after having er second child.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	well kinda, my grandma watched my cousin's kids and my cousin paid some of it and the state(michigan) paid the rest. she didnt have to go through any classes or be certified, since its family.  get ahold of oyur local WIC office and ask them about daycare assistance|`|xPeIvywdaa	lmao no    who would pay for someone to watch your kids, is this a joke, or you really this dumb    goodluck, i feel bad for the baby|`|fe2284c7dc5314722fa8e048320058f2aa	this sounds to good to be true. i think the only one who will need to pay here will be you.|`|c6NbAVgraa	If there is really such a thing, I want to be in line! =)|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	You would have to qualify for child care assistance through your county. They would have to become qualified through the same agency. Search your county + department of human services for more information with respect to your location. Then you would give your vouchers to your family member or the county would pay them directly. you must be low income to qualify for this kind of help. And the process is easier when it is a family member.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	I dont know were you live but in Australia people can be come authorised day carers in there own home (family daycare) and of course our government pays for a certain percentage of child care (child care benefit) dependant on what you earn. Family Day Care cost some failies as little as 1 or 2 dollars per day depending on there income.    I dont know if this is what you are refering too, but if so then yes it is possible but its not just as easy as all that.|`|GnXfEdegaa	Who's going to pay for this?  Where did you hear this?
kprKXEOSaa	Yes, my daughter also failed the test.    They said it can be because there is still fluid in the ear, so it is very common.  (You know, amniotic fluid.)  With a newborn, the baby can't tell them if they hear the sound, I'm not sure how the machine works, but basically the sound has to bounce back to the machine, that's how the baby passes the test.  With my baby, the nurse told me that she could tell my baby could hear the sound, she was reacting to it, it was just that the machine wasn't receiving the sound bouncing back.  So she was failing the test, but the nurse could tell there wasn't anything wrong with her hearing.  She later passed the test and doens't have any problems with her hearing.  Most likely, everything is just fine.  You can test your child's hearing, put your hand by his ear and snap your fingers.  See if he reacts to it.  If he is reacting to noises, most likely there is no problem.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my friends adughter did, she had fluid in her ears. anyway, she is a year old now and seems to hear just fine|`|nyDPFTT7aa	It maybe because he was premmature they always say they are behiind on everything. My Nephew was born at 27 weeks and he had the same thing in time it will correct itself.Good Luck Hunni. xxx|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	my oldest failed her hospital hearing test as well. When she was 3 months old they did a recheck ( which is when they are doing your sons if i did the math right). And her hearing was just fine at that check.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	it should be fine. most babies fail their first hearing test because they could still have liquid in their ears. my daughter failed and when she went back for a retest everything was fine. i wouldn't worry unless they tell you there is reason to worry.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	Yes, my daughter failed the second test at the hospital. She was born very quickly, there was muconium (sp?) in my bag of waters, and because of these issues, she had an abundance of fluid in her ears. She has been retested and is fine. Do not worry about the appointment coming up. The technician that tested my daughter said that this happens all too often and parents should not get worked up about it.|`|b51b2e15645ab29477c875a5e427c885aa	my youngest and middle child both failed, the youngest failed twice at the hospital before they let us home, the first one was just a standard probe in the ear thing and the second one she had all these pads stuck to her head and shoulders, fortunately they both passed at the next lot of tests I had to take them back for. My middle child was only the 2nd child tested in Derbyshire so it wasn't shocking that she ended up back at the hospital as it was still trial and error way back then.|`|jypbBYOBaa	Hello there, my son is now 6 weeks old and he too failed his hearing test after birth. I asked for the test to be repeated there and then and he finally passed on the third attempt. He was 3 weeks early and weighed just 3lb 14 oz. The tester said it could just be amniotic fluid still in the ears causing him to fail. Was your test done on a busy ward with lots of background noise?? This too can affect the result (I asked for him to be taken to a quiet room for the final re-test after he failed the second test again.) Please try not to worry as many babies fail the test in hospital but are found not to be suffering from any hearing loss on subsequent testing. I hope this has been helpful. Good luck in March!
mDkUmEUzaa	Please dont worry - and make the most of it!    Love from Debbie (mother to 16month old baby who NEVER stops lol)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son was pre-term and they are sometimes sleepier.  I don't think he really started to "wake up" and look around until he was about 8 weeks old.  And even then it was only sometimes.    They need a lot of sleep, it's normal.|`|pqHxDZqcaa	is it alive?|`|AA12279950	My son was the same.  He's 10 now and still sleeps at least 12hrs a night!  It's not a problem - it's obviously just what your boy needs.  Make the most of it - I bet all the other new Mums are envious!|`|uZdSCx1paa	That is what newborns are supposed to do honny!!  They just went through a crazy event, and now they have way more room to grow, so they are going to take advantage of it and grow grow grow!!!    Babies sleep alot through out their first 6 months. They like their belly full and mommy and daddy close.    Dont worry soon he will start staying hanging out longer and makeing some milestones!!!!    Congrats, and good luck!!!|`|hieQHR0daa	He is very young and it is good that he is so well settled. If do you feel that he is taking all of his feeds since  he is falling asleep during them? Is he slightly jaundiced? Some babies have a minor problem with their blood at this stage and can be jaundiced ( have a high serum biliruben) This makes them very sleepy. Exposure to sunlight and a few extra drinks of water help reduce the biliruben and then they are more wakeful. IF you are still concerned then see your doctor or Health Visitor.|`|hTQg5tgPaa	Mine was the same until about 11 weeks.  It is normal... they do a lot of their growing the first 2 months (look at a growth chart for infants - you'll notice that the first couple months are quite steep, then goes into a curve).  Mine grew 4" the first two months.  The only time she was awake, is when she was cluster feeding between 10 p.m - 2 a.m. - that was fun!!!|`|t5goBFwYaa	your baby is just experience what we called sleepatobia. is when babies dont see anything fun around them. try to get some sound making tories to see what he is going to do.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	It might take weeks or it could take months.  Normal is a very broad term for a baby, so I wouldn't worry.  If you need reassurance, call your doctor!  My daughter slept all day until she was 8 weeks old, so every baby is different.
kprKXEOSaa	My pediatrician recommended starting on solids at about 6 months, so going by that, you started a little early.  Just back off a bit.  Babies have preferences and moods, just like adults do.  It's no big deal, just keep offering.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I'd just forget about it for a while. He doesn't yet really need solids.  He may have found being spoon-fed exciting and fun at first, but now it's just a hassle.  (There's NOTHING wrong with not starting him on babyrice!  It's pure myth that you have to start with iron-fortified starch...)    So, go back to his bottles. You could try offering again every few days and see if he gets interested again, or just wait until he expresses active interest and/or or ready for table foods.  (Either one of which will probably happen in the next 1-2 months.)|`|NroZQN5vaa	Maybe he's tired of the texture. Try thickening up his foods with rice cereal. After a month of eating solids, my daughter was ready for lumpy foods. Otherwise, mention it at your next doctor's appointment.
r39EDGhPaa	Why can't you get a house of your own?  Your mom is probably sick of having to live with her grown(im guessing.) daughter and her two children.    Ask her for a little extra time so you can start planning what you will do.    edit: Maybe because you're obviously not grown up enough to have children.  You're relying on your mommy to keep a roof over your head.. when you decided to have children, that was like an agreement to grow up and raise them.  Your mom isn't responsible for them.  And do you expect pity from everyone on here? Is that why you posted this? o.O|`|VSCYTZ38aa	Can't who help? Your children?|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Contact your local social services dep't or the local council. They won't leave you out on the streets with a newborn baby to take care of.  You may be offered a place at a refuge/shelter for a while before you are allocated a house.|`|AA11530601	that is a pretty nasty thing to do, no matter what youve done, she shouldnt throw you out if youve got dependants.  I would get in touch with welfare, even if they dont have a house for you, they can put you up in a bed n breakfast until they do find one|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I don't understand the question. Can who help?  If you are under 18 then she legally cannot kick you out, but she can surrender you to the state and your dependants.     I would call around and see what aid is out there for you and your kids.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	Can 'they' help? who is 'they'?  You should contact the council who will put you into bed and breakfast if your mum is really throwing you out. Isn't it possible to talk to her though..i think you would be better off with family. B & B isn't very nice.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	you better apply to welfare and shelters and right away what happened that she is kicking you out|`|nbn0OXplaa	How old are you? If you can work, then you need to work. Look for a friend or a shelter you can stay at until you have enough money saved to support yourself. At this point it's not about you anymore, you need to provide the best for your baby.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	don't be bothered by the mean people on here. go to your local county assistance office they should be able to help you|`|8uiH6iRbaa	Don't worry don't panic    yes the council will help you.    you will be put into emergency accommodation and will probably get a social worker to help you     you will not be left high and dry    it doesn't matter if your not 18 (not sure of your age) but what ever age you are there is always some kind of help and support    maybe go and speak to your health visitor and see what they can do to help and take it from there x|`|bAp35x7uaa	You need to speak to your local authority as soon as possible.  They can put you on a list for housing but you're more than likely end up in a b&b until something becomes available. But you have to hassle them.  Seriously, you really need to hassle them otherwise they won't do anything.     Can the situation with your mother not be resolved? Can you not do your best to improve matters with her so that you can stay until such point as you can rent your own property?    Good luck|`|tTf1Zp5eaa	look in your local paper and find somewhere to rent. its that simple.|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	...you JUST HAD to have sex in your teenage years right?    we you pay the consequences now.    otherwise if your a 30 yr old, then i should say, WTF is wrong with you...|`|lXcH7ekkaa	Are you in the UK? If so, contact you local social services department. they will not leave you homeless with  a  5week old baby|`|X7DDlR1caa	get yourself to a council office and explain the situation, you will get a home it might be a one bed roomed flat but its better it being that than being on the street.|`|rF1fpyenaa	sorry, but it depends on why she is kicking you out. it seems you may live in the UK.  in certain states in the US, someone cannot legally just kick you out.  they have to go through a process and at times it takes 6 or more months.   i would look into the legality of it all and good luck to you and your baby.  hope all works out.|`|hTQg5tgPaa	go to a church for direction... even if you are not a Christian.  Many churches have programs for your situation or can point you in the right direction.  They shouldn't push anything on you, however they tend to have connections at least.  i.e. a church by where I am supports a home for single mothers & you don't have to be or become a Christian... they are usually just there to help.|`|nT7NGReUaa	Why do you say everyone is being horrible? You are obviously very young..perhaps you should have considered the wider picture before having a child in the first place. Contraception if very available these days. If you cant provide for a baby you should not have got pregnant.  We are not being horrible...you just cant cope with honest common sense.|`|aWWgPkryaa	You can contact the following people who should be able to help, or at least tell you what to do:    Shelter  Your health visitor  Your local council    On the bright side you do get help faster if you are being thrown out of somewhere.    Good luck|`|a772ac727655daef254b8e6748f36d1faa	So the BF left.  Guess he's a jerk now, right?  Should've waited a little longer to figure that out before you spread your legs.  Now you're just another statistic.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I live in the US, so I don't know how social services work in the UK.    Is it possible that you can reach an agreement with your mother to stay on a little longer?  Whatever the options are in the UK, I'm sure they're going to be a drag with a 5 week old.    Obviously your mother wants you out, and so you are going to have to leave.  But perhaps you could ask her for a "stay of execution" so to speak.  If there are certain aspects of your behavior or lifestyle that you can change to make her happy, do it.      Ask her if you can stay until the baby is 3 months old and then get cracking to find a new situation!  Appeal to her better nature and her natural grandmotherly concern.  Even if she's mad at you, she probably doesn't want the child to suffer.
xjRCdRnxaa	Hey you!  Okay, im Clomid, and I produced follicles on both sides, so yes it must be possible, as as result they lowered my dose of 50mg, taken fo 5days, down to only 3days.  With you needing to ovultate from a specific side, perhaps you will get a higher dose so you get follicles both side?? Just an opinion.  It depends on what youre advised as to when you take it, im day 2 of cycle, some are day 5 i think.  I had 40-42 day cycles, now on Clomid, down to 30-32 which is geat.  I still get CM both fertile and non-fertile . but it may vary in women.  I didnt ovulate before, and i do now, starting 5th cycle on 17th, hoping it happens in next 2 as its finished then and may go to IVF!!!  Best of luck, its not too bad, first mth every side effect imagainable but after it was reduced nothing i couldnt handle!!  My moods are lots better since the reduced dose too - first mth i was evil!!  I wish you lots of luck and enjoy the break, hopefully that helps you concieve! xx|`|3aV4lcCqaa	hey geo    i am on clomid i didnt ovulate on my own... 50mg i produced 1 egg and 100mg i produced 4, 3 on my right side and 1 on my left side which is blocked.    i took it cd2-6 and i didnt get any mucas with clomid i had to buy preseed the substitute for mucas.  i never properly temped to be honest.    i am starting a private round of IUI at st helier next month as it is only 450quid before i start ivf in 5-6 months.  i will be on clomid i believe for the IUI.      my advice would be to take the clomid before you go to bed at night so that you sleep through the side effects which can be hot flushes.  make sure you use an OPK (preferably a digital) so you know when you are ovulating.    goodluck i wish you all the best for the cycle.  and have a great time on your holiday, sounds great.    love jojo x

ASMzLyGEaa	dont get knocked up|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Don't drink or smoke, eat healthily, take your vitamins, don't do strenuous activity and most importantly, RELAX. You can't cut the risk of miscarriage 100%, but doing the above may help. Congrats :)|`|wl7tlYOYaa	You can't really prevent it or lower the risks of it happening...you can however help the baby be healthy by eating healthy, taking your prenatals, resting, and not lifting heavy things. I know its hard I've been paranoid of miscarriage since I found out I was pregnant I guess since we have more knowledge now of all the things that can go wrong we g et more paranoid. Try to relax although I know its near impossible everytime I felt something wet I would go check if I was bleeding so I know how you feel and this is not my first but before I was pretty oblivious to all those bad things so they never crossed my mind.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Staying off your feet,not lifting anything heavy, not having intercourse for the first three months. These are the things I am doing b/c I am having signs of a threatening miscarriage.|`|A0NfgNEiaa	there is nothing u can do apart from take it easy if its gonna happen it will happen.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Take your prenatal. Get regular checkups and stay away from the things you are not allowed to have during pregnancy.     Keep in mind, I did all of that and still had 2 miscarriages in a row. Its a gamble. You don't know when an egg doesn't fertilize properly.|`|fNE7Q7e8aa	Take prenatal vitamin tablets containing  folic acid:)|`|NE96fU9vaa	if you are high risk for misscarriage, quit job,or work from home, stay home, rest, stay off feet, lay down, if you dont have a risk, you can do what ever you feel like, as long as you are comfortable, i wouldnt take any medicine not prescribed and necessary, dont stress, dont lift , dont reach over head,other than that, you can enjoy.    sorry to be so gloomy, if you have had miscarages, i am sorry.|`|jzdhqxPTaa	There isn't much you can do.  Don't stay on your feet, no heavy lifting, no heavy excersise. Taking things light and easy.  Don't drink, no smoking or drugs.  NO SEX! Even stimulating your self can be harmful. (I learnt that!)    What to do if you start to spot.  Ring your midwife/doctor, if your having cramps you will be asked to go in. They might try to get you to take a pill, trust your instinct's. I wouldn't take it. These pills are to help you miscarry. Like I said, trust your instincts. I knew my baby wasn't dying and she still isn't.    If you spot, its important to have bed rest for 2 weeks! Take time off work, stay in bed, no activities what so ever. Just read and only get up when hungry and nature calls.  Also, get a bean bag or load of pillows and rest your bum on them. So your legsand tummy area are raised.  This strengthens your uterus. Drink plenty of water and stay away from chemicals and bad foods. Just eat fresh stuff.  If you miscarry, this is because something was wrong, but alot of the time it can be caused by other things. This is why its vital for bedrest.    I know this because I have a very good friend who specialises in high risk pregnancys and is giving me the best advice in the world.    Hope I helped!
jiTKnCKpaa	Usually if its brown then it is just old blood coming out but its best to get any get of blood or colored discharge checked.|`|rh12tX8Naa	Totally normal. That happened to me around 6 weeks. Also, it happens after you get a pap smear. You are ok.|`|14f43f349bb66eb9fca9c31edef61771aa	I've heard this normal, but u can ask your doctor if want reassurance.
fYMWDQLGaa	yes its right that way the baby can be safe , its the only way it can also rest on a side, if u sleep on ur back, it will feel wobbling..    happy pregnancy|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, it is best to sleep on your side. (It helps with the blood flow to the uterus.)  However, it's not critical -- if you can't sleep on your side, you CAN sleep on your back.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	No, do not sleep on your back... doing this may constrict blood flow to the baby lowering his or her heart rate too much... That is while it's better to sleep on your side... or when you see on tv or movies for people to get off their back... the *left* side they say is best for blood flow... why i don't exactly know. always best to follow Dr's orders! good luck!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Well, my obgyn said not to sleep on my back when it gets uncomfortable, and I am 26 weeks and still can.. I think it depends on the pregnancy.|`|aLkCxq5aaa	yep sadly!  So that you don't restrict the main arteries, x|`|xnhwmontaa	When Im pregnant I sleep on my belly with it to the side.....but i dont know about with your back|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Ideally you should sleep on you left side to allow optimum blood flow to your placenta. You can still sleep in other positions but it is not "recommended". If you sleep on your right side, nothing bad will happen, it's just not the "best" choice. Sleeping on your stomach is out for obvious reasons and sleeping on you back is bad because the baby puts pressure on your big artery. It can also aggravate hemorrhoids and other things. Nothing will really happen from sleeping on your back as you will wake up before anything happens. You might feel a little tingly like your limps are falling asleep because of the decreased blood flow. If you do sleep on your back you might not get as good a nights sleep as when you sleep on your side.|`|AA11801100	they say it better to sleep on your left side for better blood flow. Since you lay on your back the pressure of the baby and ur organs being moved from their original place make it a lil difficult for your blood flow to get to where it needs to.|`|qcKXgAzVaa	the reason they tell you that is cause as the baby gets bigger, if you lie on your back, then the baby is pressing on all your insides...  They tell you more for your own comfort more than anything, cause if the baby is heavy, it could cause numbness on your lower back and things..  I think it just depends how you feel, i'm 39 weeks, and still occasionally lie on my back to go to sleep, i just sometimes find it more comfortable, so i wouldn't worry too much about it... x|`|hNiKE6Ptaa	They are right.  When you sleep on your back the weight of baby and uterus can compress the main artery in turn decreasing blood flow to the baby.  This means baby is getting less of everything such as nutrients and oxygen.  Your left side is best for blood flow to baby as well as your heart but either side will do.|`|5nAWhEKRaa	LOL yes that's right! I'm 16 weeks and one day pregnant and I can burly stand to lay on my back cuz of all the preacher it puts on me and plus if u have the book( what to expect when you expecting) it well help you under stand your pregnancy. it was my bible for pregnancy. And I do believe the doctor is the one with the degree in health so she or he would know. But get that book it really dose help I PROMS!|`|IWinNj2saa	Somehow, laying on your back, pinches the blood from your placenta, to your baby, which isn't good. It's preferred you sleep on your left side, but the right side can be slept on as well.|`|9pBHqNsXaa	yes they are right. I had a hard time sleeping on my sides, but we have to because baby is getting bigger and laying on our backs can squish the main blood flow to you and baby. I found that sleeping in a recliner worked best for me. maybe you could try it and see if that helps with some added comfort
wzXJOSIeaa	I'm surprised they didn't give you something to help you out. When I went in they gave me pitosin to help speed up the labor. Are you 40 weeks?|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	awwwww sweetie I hear you! I went in 3 times before be admitted the 3rd time. I know how frustrating it is and how sad you feel! Don't worry.. it'll come soon enough. Take this time to sleep and relax.|`|xnhwmontaa	yes its quite normal to feel that way....try having sex.....or walking around...that can put you back into labor...how far along are you?|`|OPTDFRuzaa	awe yes of course you will feel down because you thought you were meeting your baby and not you have to wait longer. totally normal. it will be you soon. good luck.|`|BQYXgtq7aa	I would say you are both depressed and disappointed. Truth is, bubs is simply not ready yet. And its so frustrating!  I was induced at 37 weeks (due to pre eclampsia illness) and it failed. I was transferred to another hospital where they induced me there and it finally worked. I had strong contractions but i wasnt dialating or progressing. I understand frustration! I was in labour a total of 8 days, with full on labour being 10 hours then 4 hours of pushing (and an hour after that where they cut me, pulled baby out with forceps and stitched me back up)  I didnt have a great labour, but I came through it and I have a happy healthy beautiful baby boy who is nearly 14 months.   Be easy on yourself, keep yourself entertained however you can (gentle cleaning, puzzles, knitting, cooking, movies, etc). You'll thank yourself someday for having time to yourself now. Have a relaxing bath and read in it. Ask your hubby to give you a massage. Milk it for all its worth!! :-)|`|tHM6TjtIaa	ABSOLUTELY! Oh honey I have went through this so many times... Telling you to be patient won't help... I know I cam to a point where I wanted to just reach in there and pull her out lol! You will get through this...     If you begin contracting, time them, when they are 3 minutes apart for a steady hour, meaning you don't miss one contraction the entire hour.... Take your toosh to the hospital!|`|AA11801100	Yes it is normal. I mean you get all happy that your bundle of joy is finally coming and nothing. Try walk a lot today.  Some people say having sex help but that is up to you and how you feel. Don't worry the contractions will come and your baby will soon be here. Take care. Good luck!|`|e5FoLh2Paa	I'm a L&D RN--if your cervix didn't dilate more with the contractions, you weren't in labor.  You were just having contractions.  The definition of true labor is contractions that change your cervix.  And BTW, your husband won't ever go into labor.  Privilege reserved strictly for women!|`|TFnE3qisaa	Maybe both - you thought that this was the moment you have been waiting for, for the longest nine months of your life, and then you are told NOPE, DON'T PASS GO DON'T COLLECT.... you get the picture. You thought that by today you would be holding your little one in your arms and you aren't - it is okay to feel sad about that but hang in there- the baby will come - and all the waiting is worth it.     I went into the hospital because I had toxemia and then the baby had an infection and had to stay in the NICU and I went home without a baby - that was the hardest thing I have ever had to do - as I was being wheeled out I watched someone else being wheeled out with their baby - it was awful - but I survived - Liam survived and now we are extremely happy!     Good luck!
2cstdEkIaa	I would say highly unlikely..sorry|`|fZ3QvagVaa	I would say you chances are very slim..
wl7tlYOYaa	When I was pregnant with my daughter I swore I wasnt because I felt like my period was coming well I waited and waited and it never came. With this one I was actually hoping it didnt but still felt like it was so yeah I think its normal. I had everything I get before my period starts but the bleeding. Its normal to be cramping when your pregnant your fine dont worry. And the period is coming feeling very normal I think it happens to most of us.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You are getting cramps from your uterus stretching. It's perfectly normal and they feel just like period cramps.|`|AA11801100	Well all I can really tell you is that even at 8 weeks pregnant (i'm now 14 weeks) I was still having cramps even that far along. As long as there is no showing of blood of any kind you are good. But if you are really worried just go talk to your doctor he/she will put your mind at ease. Good Luck.|`|NE96fU9vaa	one of my pregnancies, i had a light period, and was still pregnant|`|2cstdEkIaa	This is absolutely normal. I had the same thing in July. It didnt end until my period would have normally ended. Get a heating pad and rest, it will subside some|`|BQYXgtq7aa	I recommend going to see your doctor. Have you had an ultrasound or internal examination yet?  Not to worry you, but it could be a miscarriage (with blood not yet having come out) or even an ectopic pregnancy (where the egg fertilises itself in the fallopian tube and doesnt progress into the uterus). It could also be just simply cramps. Perhaps baby is pressing on a nerve or something. Go see your doctor, put your mind at ease.  Good luck|`|Hhifw93laa	its normal to cramp while your prego your body is changing go to the doc and talk to her God bless|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	very normal, many early pregnancy symptoms mimic PMS|`|0k5hixiWaa	Its very normal.  The cramping is just your uterus growing and your baby making space for the baby.    Congratulations!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I had my period for the first 3 months of pregnancy and my daughter is now 7. Its normal.     No worries.

LNfE5ZqUaa	That would be a negative. Your hormones (HCG) needs to build up a bit before you experience any of those symptoms.  If there is enough hcg in your body, you would be able to turn a pregnancy test positive.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Yep. I knew I was pregnant 3 days after conception. Hubby didnt believe me, but i felt like crap.|`|Pdex43zgaa	It's not morning sickness, you shouldn't have swallowed.|`|IWinNj2saa	I hate heartburn 7 days after I ovulated, and was pregnant. That was my first sign. If it was true for me, it can be true for you. Good Luck|`|X83LVP6Iaa	You could have heart burn just days after conception and feel sick to your stomach, yes. However it wouldn't be because you are pregnant. It would just be a coincidence. Days after conception your body hasn't had time to "realize" it is pregnant yet.     In other words, if you've got heart burn and feeling sick, its because of something else. A pregnancy test wouldn't even show you were pregnant.
qmQ1RDL9aa	I really llike Ruby and Lacey. My dog's name is Ellie so I think that would be wierd for a girl, in my opinion. For the guys, I LOVE the name Jack. Harrisons okay. And Harvey is cute.

a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	Wow, what a mess! With a normal 27 or 28 day cycle ovulation usually occurs on day 13 or 14. However, sperm can live inside the body for up to 3 days. Sometimes even longer, under the right conditions. The only way of knowing who the father is is if they get a dna test done. Some people believe that marijuana can kill sperm, but really it has little effect. I think she should also be getting to a doctor for an STD test and not be havingunprotected sex with multiple partners, as this increases the risk of STDs.|`|0AXz8GFPaa	OMG - Honestly your friend needs to grow up.

If she happens to have fraternal twins, she could be having one with each guy.  There is no way to tell, until after the baby is born and she has a DNA test.   Beg her to give the baby up for adoption.  What a nice thing to tell your child, "well, I was a skank, so I didn't know who your father was, so we had a DNA test done."  Save the child from this mess!  Adoption!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	You can't tell. It depends on what day she ovulated. What you can tell is your friend is a skank.

yrDqtazLaa	False positives don't exist often. How long after you peed on the stick did you get that positive? If it was after 10 minutes, the reading is null and void, but if it was before 10 minutes, it's real. One positive test can knock out 100 negative tests. Go ahead and make an appointment with an OB/GYN to get it confirmed, you may even want to go in and request a blood test to confirm it. Good luck!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Get a digital test like clear blue easy, YOU CANNOT TEST FOR PREGNANCY on any day but the first day you missed your period. THAT is why you got diff results.

You should know then for sure.|`|NE96fU9vaa	it just means there wasnt enough preg hormone in the sample to register, use first morn pee, you can save it in a cup, and dip the test in,if you want

If you are looking to be pregnant and wanting it, have sex every day for like 2 months,, This way if you miss a period, you will know..     If you are not wanting to be pregnant, use contraception.|`|hJwPs7zyaa	In my opinion it is very unlikely that you are pregnant since you have ovulated. However, you should go to your Doctors should you have any concerns that way you can be sure. On another note, I know this is off subject in a way, however, you have asked for peoples help so I will help! Personally, I would go to the Doctors anyway after having unprotected intercourse, in case the person you had intercourse with had any Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI's). I am not trying to insinuate anything about your life-style. But on the knowledge that I have read in the above it is impossible to tell how well you know this person. Going back to the subject in question. I would be very surprised if you was pregnant. But like I said if you have any doubts go to you General Practitioner.  I sincerly hope this helps.    Kind Regards,  Sam|`|KWPnoqGMaa	if you had a normal period like any other period you had then no you are not pregnant. usually when someone have there period when there pregnant its very light and shorter and its nothing like a normal period would be.|`|NE96fU9vaa	a doctor can check youre cervix and tell all kind of things, a blood test will show for shure|`|dj8ofPtgaa	Well you are suppose to with most traditional tests to take the test 5 days after your MISSED period. Yes you can have a period and still be pregnant. Careful of playing tricks with your mind because if you think your pregnant, your body may start to react to pregnancy, hence you getting sick without really knowing. Take another test if that will bring you reassurance.|`|VGepMqP0aa	ive been in the same situation :/ stressful  i think by the sound of it you should be fine but u need to do another test after 3 weeks from the unprotected sex  the amount of time u left for the first test was not long enough    best of luck x
sbfm5rCAaa	At such and early stage of pregnancy they won't see very much on a tummy U/S. If you had a transvaginal one then they would have seen much more as the baby is very small (about the size of a grain of rice).    Have the internal scan and I'm sure you will see your baby perfectly. In a few weeks you will be able to see the baby on the tummy U/S as well.    Good luck|`|VQifKNfgaa	5-6 weeks really is too early to see anything form on ultrasound done on your stomach.  using the internal ultrasound, you will be able to see everything, but it will look like a tiny peanut if your only 6 weeks. its happened to me! :)|`|CUYuAGF5aa	This early in the pregnancy it is too hard to see clearly using a normal tummy ultrasound scan.  At 7 weeks they done an internal scan for me and still wasn't much to see but it allows them to get closer to the baby to see what's going on.    Good luck!|`|X83LVP6Iaa	I've never had an internal scan, however with my kids I had regular scans around 6-7 weeks and there isn't much to see at that time. With this pregnancy, I could see what looked like a blob (LOL) by 8 weeks. At my 10 week scan it started to look more humanish. Good luck to you and I hope all works the way you want it.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	On 5 weeks my doctor told me I have an ectopic pregnancy,and he sent me for a internal scan to see what is going on. I had an internal scan on 6-7 weeks, and they said that everything was okay, I did not have an ectopic pregnancy, and the saw a heartbeat.     You can definitely see more on an internal scan.|`|KTGSXjvfaa	The doc should be doing an internal ultra when ur that early. I went when we nine weeks and that is what they did for us. the heartbeat should show by six weeks. Just take it easy I sure eveything will be just fine.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Don't worry, your baby is too small to see at this point and the heartbeat can't be detected until 6weeks +. At least they seen the sac which is a good sign.    In the UK we don't get scans until 12weeks + because the baby is too small to be detected and it can make us worry.|`|4cehW3S9aa	You can definitely see much better with a vaginal ultrasound.  I had a vaginal ultrasound at 8w 6d and 11w 2d and you could see the baby clearly.  The 8w 6d one didn't look quite like a baby yet but the 11w 2d baby had all the extremities formed and facial features were forming.    Generally, I think the only time they do the tummy ultrasound is when you find out the sex of your child around 20 weeks.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	when i was 6 weeks pregnant i had a bleed. it turned out to be nothing to worry about but i had an internal scan just to make sure.  they didn't offer me an external ultrasound because they said the chances of seeing the baby were small. They couldn't even see the heart beat because the baby was so small so i wouldn't panic!|`|aTk0A9SHaa	I had my ultra sound scan when i was 6-7 weeks the sac was very visible but finding the baby was hard she bought the picture up very close and eventually we cold see it took ed up in the corner it was very small didn't even look like a baby but i could see the heart beat. She  told me it was early on and to come back in a few weeks this is what you will probably be advised to do   Good luck|`|i8Ch743Laa	That early,you're not going to see much. They did one at 6 1/2 weeks with me,and It wasn't even in baby shape at all yet. It was a pole and the sac,and it looked like a scopion kinda lol. Just calm down,you should have had a trans vaginal ultrasound anyways,i don't know what they were thinking doing a basic ultrasound on your stomach...|`|OPTDFRuzaa	yes its too small to see with a normal ultrasound. i had to have an internal at 9 weeks and my bab ywas a normal weight but they are so hard to pick up before 11-12 weeks with a normal scan you should defo see a blob with the internal and the heart starts beating around six weeks so they should pick it up too. good luck.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	An internal wont pick up anything more because 6 weeks is way early. All that will show is a yolk sack.|`|p61Ccuvyaa	i had a couple of internal ultra scans. they really cant see much on a tummy scan when you are early along.. why did they do one anyway..|`|8uiH6iRbaa	first of all at six weeks they will normally do an internal scan...    An internal scan will show up more because by the end of 6 weeks pregnancy they should be able to detect a heartbeat.    I found out i was pregnant and had to go for an early scan because i had miscarried previously. I had a internal scan at 6 weeks and they were hoping to see a heart beat but they didn't i went back for another internal a week later (7 weeks) and by this point a heart beat should be clear. But no still no heart beat all they could see was a sack and the sack hadn't developed at all in size in the period of 2 weeks     so i went home and 4 days later i miscarried again :-(    this is know as incomplete miscarriage.    this is when miscarriage has occurred but some of the products of conception, such as the amniotic sac or placenta remain with the uterus.    It could be that it's still a wee bit early so just hold on tight and see    hope all works out   x  x|`|zXIDR1INaa	Normally at that period they do the vaginal ultrasound and i am pretty sure alls they would see at that point is the sac.  I had one with my first at 6 weeks and he was a little sac at that point.
JYcF0Jl5aa	One of the best diets to calm down hyper children is Gluten Free & Casein Free Diet... Most parents with children into the Autism Spectrum & ADHD are using this diet w/great success... I took my son to a DAN! Dr (Defet Autism Now), He explained me how the adsocion of gluten & casein produce high histamine that is the cause of hyperactives. The Dr did some blood test on my son & this show that his histamine was too high. We changed to a Gluten-Free & Casein-Free diet & his hyperactives have decreased considerably... The book I used to make some of his food is "The Kid-Friendly ADHD & Autism Cookbook" by Pamela Compart|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	I don't have the name of a book, but I have recently researched this online for my son, and the diet you want, I believe, is called the Feingold Diet. You might try to google that, or ask for it at your local bookstore.
Po2UqfvWaa	take him to the book store and see what interest him. bad grades are not to be punished. the bad grades are the punishment itself. the bad attitude is self protection. find out why. anger is fear. fear of not being good enough, not worthy of love/family, etc. just my thoughts    the book i would recommend is: courageous souls|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	i would make him spend most of his time reading and studying whatever classes he needs to work on bringing up and THEN if he had any free time take him to the library to get a book or two.|`|AA11570236	I would ask him what the trouble is and how important his learning really is.|`|67EaIAvbaa	take him for a visit to prison,they have a tour thing there for that purpose.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Take him to the library and let him choose a book he might like.       My honest opinion is that taking everything away from him is only going to make him withdrawal more. I could see limiting time with tv, games and everything else OR taking one thing away for a certain length of time. Forcing him into reading books isn't going to change his attitude or how he feels about education.     You might want to dig deeper into what's going on with him and work on a plan together that gets him more into school....    He's 15, not 8.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	I would imagine you want to give him something to be a little more grateful or in some way change his attitute for the better.  I don't like A Child Called It or The Lost Boy, but these two books are biographies of a horrible child abuse case in California. So, I suppose that's something to think about. Right now I'm reading What is the What by Dave Eggers. It's about one of the Lost Boys of Sudan who I suppose told him everything that happened to him and he wrote it into a book. Might be too punishing to make him read such books where he's obviously supposed to feel horrible.  I think Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Dave Eggers might be less punishing, about a young boy who's father dies in the WTC and what he does after his father dies.|`|lC5NLsZZaa	"Night" by Elie Wiesel. It will make him appreciate his present life and opportunities greatly.    I would NOT suggest 'The Wild Boys' by William S. Burroughs.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	go ask alice is a great book and so is too fat to fish the only two books i have ever wanted to read|`|vuDE5TPbaa	Life of Pi.    Great book, great story, amazing end.    Or, why not take him out and let him pick. Not only will that get him to show some interest in a book, he will be more likely to read something that he picked, not that he was told to read.|`|upk9TNWsaa	No if you were to take him somewhere it should be mcdonalds and explain if he doesn't keep his grades up he will be working there the rest of his life.     You sound like a great parent for caring, my mom and dad never were around when I was that age. I would just spend time with him more, like a movie night at home together. I don't know maybe sit down and play games with him as a family. Just show him he is loved and there is a reason to him being grounded. Make sure he knows why his grades need to be better. I think his attitude will improve if he sees you trying to show him you care. Kind of like killing him with kindness, how could he have a bad attitude then? Idk you could try it I guess.|`|y4LGs8CCaa	Find a book whose story line is similar to what he is going through. One whose main character triumps in the end after experiences in and with the same type of people, places and things he may be having problems with.|`|dv1n6lTmaa	Ask him if he wants to get some help with his classes. If he is getting failing grades because his lack of studying or not even trying then it should be punished. Also from someone with a 16 yr old I found taking what he likes to do the most all at once is not a good thing. His new saying is "he has nothing left to lose".    Take him to a book store and let him choose.|`|GRyFxwTbaa	You can't go wrong with To Kill a Mockingbird or All Quiet on the Western Front.    Both good stories, easy reads, and will make him think.|`|HCL7FpTqaa	My parents used to ground me like that and it made me hate them for it.  I understand your need to get through to him though.      Stephen Kings Gunslinger series is excellent--you might try that.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	harry potter!!!  there fantastic for all ages. exciting.. and long  : )|`|9GmoO5NLaa	A hard question to answer without really knowing the boy, however if he likes fantasy I would reccomend the black magician triology.  The first book is The Magicians Guild:    http://www.amazon.co.uk/Magicians-Guild-...    However if you are looking to expand his thoughts and views I would reccomend either Animal Farm or 1984 by George Orwell.  I read both of these books at 15.    P.S.  I have found that just banning children from everything doesn't work on the long term.  If you would like to encourage his logic then perhaps try to get him to play "Real Time Strageties" such as Command and Conquer or Age of Empires.    P.P.S I wouldn't use reading as a punishment either....|`|tAaxrqUYaa	you dont ground people for things that trivial. if you ground people for things like that it wont help them do any better. there may be a more genuine reason for the bad grades and attitude.|`|5Mvn48dnaa	Well I can't help you much but my 18 year old brother and I both read A Child Called It, and I read the second one. Some of my friends like Twilight, I have The City Of Ember, The People Of Sparks,The Prophit of Yonwood, and I am going to get The Diamond of Darkhood. The last four are The City Of Ember City. You can get all of these books at Barnes and Noble Bookstore. You could take him to Barnes and Noble and have him choose a book.  I like all those books above so you can get an idea. I am a girl unfortunatly so this may help or may not.|`|GnXfEdegaa	As for the bad grades.  Which started first? Or did they start at the same time?  It depends on if this is a pattern for him and if he is doing the best he can, grade wise.  Have you talked to him about what is bothering him?  Maybe he is being bullied at school or something is going on that is making him act out and get bad grades.  I agree w/other posters take him to the library and have an outing to find some good books.|`|FFF7oGDzaa	I second Life of Pi, its a really good book
QnJvJ67uaa	I was told once it was linked to a potassium deficiency??  I ate a banana before bed every night and it helped my horrible calf cramps during pregnancy.  Can't hurt to try :)  Good luck =D|`|tHM6TjtIaa	Eat banana's you are low on potassium... They help and quickly!|`|KTGSXjvfaa	Sounds to me that u may need more potassium, try eating some bananas. I use to get the awful when i was preg with my oldest. I did see that the bananas helped a little. The cramps use to wake me in the night just a crying.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	i used to get terrible cramps in the middle of the night in my legs. midwife said tonic water and resting with them above my body would ease it but it did not maybe these things would work for you or your mother? its just hormones i think.
tHM6TjtIaa	Take another one.|`|RRo1la66aa	dont buy the cheap ones...they lie.|`|a0E9QbwMaa	Definite pregnancy. Go start buying clothes for the new baby. I'm pretty sure it's a new boy and they say purple is the new blue. Congratulations!|`|Ks7ibx9Uaa	As another poster said, the results on a pregnancy test are only valid for a short period of time, i.e. the result can change if the test is left for a while. However, saying this, a false positive is rare, whereas a false negative is extremely common, as levels of the HCG hormone (the pregnancy hormone) are low and sometimes undetectable in early pregnancy.    I really think you should buy a more expensive, reliable pregnancy test or visit your GP. Do the test as early in the day as you can. If you receive a negative, don't be too disheartened; keep trying!    If you are the patient type (which no trying-to-get-pregnant woman is!) then why not just wait to see if your period arrives? If not, then test again!    Good Luck!|`|eVmQGDHQaa	regardless of whether you left your test in the bin there is no way that there would be a pink line unless the test is faulty becuase the pt's are designed to pick up the pregnancy hormone in your urine. Perhaps you need to go and buy a more reputable test and try again    All the best|`|KTGSXjvfaa	Most test say not to read after 10 mins because you could get a false pos. I would take another one first thing in the morning to get the best result. GOODLUCK!!!!!|`|bmhYo6r9aa	why don't you try 2 more test ? or go to nearby clinic to confirm your fears. remember to buy good and valid one. Goodluck|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	In early pregnancy you should use the first urine of the day    No, it does not mean you are pregnant, a test is only good for a short time period    If your period does not come in a week, retest with the first urine of the day|`|i8Ch743Laa	It's most likely positive from being left out. That's how it goes if you look at them after the ten minute line,they come up with false positives that way,but they're not actual positives. Go digital,that way there is no false hope.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Tests are only reliable after the 2 minutes you need to wait. Over night there is a chemical reaction with oxygen.     Doesn't count. Wait until you miss your period and take a new one.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	It happened to me, and I was pregnant. I think you should get another test, a better one this time.    But you are pregnant.  Congrats!!!!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	First, don't take a test in at night. You really need to take it with your first mornings urine or you will not get accurate results. Second, no test can be read after 10 minutes so don't go by what it says the next morning. Cheap tests are just as good as expensive tests so the test is not a problem. Get another one and take it first thing in the morning, before you eat or drink anything for best results.
yrDqtazLaa	No worries, spotting is normal, and mild/dull cramping is also normal (it is your uterus stretching). If the cramping becomes very painful and the bleeding becomes heavy, you would need to get medical help right away, as that could be a miscarriage. It is safe to have sex, it won't hurt the baby. The only time you shouldn't have sex is when you aren't comfortable or when the doctor advises against it. Good luck!|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	My cousin had spotting early on and everything was fine. Talk to your doctor about that though just so they can keep an eye on it.     If you are uncomfortable making love, don't do it... god gave that boy two hands and until you feel okay and your doctor says its okay, he can entertain himself. Don't feel bad it may be for the health of your baby, ask your doctor and if you spot or bleed during the act don't do it and get it checked.    Everyone I know would go through a time or two where they thought their nausea was gone, as much as you hate throwing up sometimes its just a reminder when you don't have your belly. Don't worry, it very well may come back or maybe you're lucky and you just had a short period of morning sickness.    Good luck and keep your chin up... take some time for you, even if it means taking a mental day from work... they always help to keep me sane!|`|AA10927320	well i would wait to have sex just in case i belive thats how i lost my first with my hormones raging we had sex like 4 times a day and then i lost it i was only 7 weeks  a month later i got pregnant again and we decided to take things slower  even though  the husband gets anxious remind him whats more important  i would say give it a week more just in case  i do however congratulate u as u are past ur morning sickness phase   all i can say is just keep it chill for a while|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi it sounds like your just having some spotting and if you get any after sex its a cervical erosion which is not as bad as it sounds. it just means there is tissue which has been moved when you have sex and you have some spotting or light bleeding. if you dont feel up to sex then your partner should support you on this. you might stop getting morning sickness and nausea or it might come back but if your really worried see a midwife or your gp. good luck.|`|eVmQGDHQaa	You must go and see your doctor or midwife dont take any chances the spotting could be from inplantaion bleeding as the egg attaches itself to the womb this can also cause period like pains but check it out all the same. As for sex NO NO NO not till you are positive that all is ok if he is serious about your child then he needs to think of you and the baby more than his PENIS!!!! The nausea tends to come and go I had the same 4 days I would be sick then all of a sudden it would be gone it went that way up until I was 24 weeks.    Good Luck now go to your doctor!!!|`|4tf5q7EOaa	Hi I am pregnant too I just found it earlier I just had menstruation last january 3 2009 i have no clue how many weeks is my baby in my woumb but now I feel hungry, always and some abdominal pain but can still tolerate not that bad though just feel hungry again. Well my bf and I will consult Dr. in monday but secretly becasue my parents dont know it yet toinkz.. its the most painful haha.|`|hNiKE6Ptaa	spotting is normal in early pregnancy as long as its not bright red and so is cramping due to your growing uterus.  they sometimes feel just like menstral cramps.  i would ask the doc though about sex.  I dont think you have anything to worry about though.  Relax(i know thats easier said than done).  I think you'll be fine though.  Congratulations and take it easy.|`|KK3skQc2aa	If the dr thinks the baby is ok then he/she really is ok. Some women have their periods throughout their entire pregnancy! I never did but my mother did for all three of her children and my sister did the first half of hers. Some womens bodies just produce a lot of extra hormones that still need a way of escaping. Also, unless your dr says you cannot have sex than I wouldnt worry about that either.     According to most obgyn's, even if you arent the ones that have a menstrual cycle, spotting and cramping is still common in the first trimester because of the attachment and the body trying to grow the placenta. I cramped for the first 4 months and I am 39 weeks pregnant now. Unless the dr says there is a problem then I wouldnt worry about it.    And if on the off chance there is something wrong, be comforted in the fact that your body is doing what it is supposed to do by "miscarrying" the embryo. Its our bodies natural way of "only the strong survive." The human body is so much smarter than any test or scan and it can actually tell when missing genes or chromosones occure and will, as I have said, expell the pregnancy. This-although heartbreaking-is a good thing. I know, thats a hard thing to accept. But its better than having a child born with severe mental, physical disabilities.|`|WLtsumGBaa	pls listen to your body. if you dont want sex because of fear then listen to yourself. i had the same fear and didnt have sex even tho the dr.s and every1 told me i could. later i found out i had placenta previa and the dr. completely restricted me from sex. but they can only see this around your 16-20wk appt. i just gave him oral =)
Po2UqfvWaa	well, i had 4 c-sections. i too did not have my husband around because we were in the navy. i had no family close by. however, my mother spent the first 6 weeks with me. i lived in idaho and she flew in from wisconsin. that helped a lot. the pain is great, i won't lie. it's hard to breast feed. they have you get up and start walking around shortly after surgery and that helps even though it hurts. when you see your son, the pain will feel different. that bond makes things change. all i can really say from my own personal experience is take it slow and easy. keep your son close by ( not in bed) it will be difficult to lift him, but just keep it slow|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	It's not that bad.  I've had two c-sections, and I was perfectly able to take care of my children right after they were born.  Yes, it would be nice to have more help, but you can do it.  You're going to be sore for a few weeks, but it's not going to be anything you can't handle.  Just take it slow and easy, and don't try to do more than you feel you can handle at the time.   You don't need to be ultra-super-Mom in the first two weeks. Believe me, as long as your baby gets fed and changed, they will be fine.     My suggestion is that when you're home alone with the baby, worry about nothing BUT taking care of yourself and the baby.  Since your husband can't take time off of work to help you, leave things like the cleaning and the laundry to him for the first few weeks until you feel better.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Its not that bad.     Just relax, its just a c section, you will be fine.     Think of the labor you are avoiding :)|`|OTxCCXa5aa	I've never been in your situation so I can't  imagine how you feel. I know you must be terrified because I know I'm scared about having a child and I'm not having a c-section or having to face so much alone. All I can think to say is just try and remember that hundreds of women have done this in much harder situations than you're own. They've done it by themselves without even having a husband or partner to even call for comfort never mind help or come to the hospital with them. That's what I try to think about when I get panicky, I find a certain amount of comfort in the knowledge that so many people have struggled through much worse than I will and they've survived. It's not the greatest advice in the world im sure, but it helps.    good luck!|`|xnhwmontaa	I have had 2 c sections and in Sep will be my third....dont worry I will take you through step by step...when you first get their they will start you on a saline drip just to get fluids in you....I had 2 or 3 bags before i went it... then they will start a catheter. not so bad but unpleasant... then the doc will come in and start your epidural....they may or may not start the medicine though....They didnt on me and i walked down the the OR then they start it there. they will shave your belly and top of your genital...then put lots of iodine.. they will test you a few times to insure you are fully numbed..,then they will start they will begin cutting.....its a weird sensation...when they start to take the baby out you will feel a lot of pressure if you start to feel pain tell the doc and he will give you more medicine...pretty soon the baby will be out! it only take about 20 mins after the baby is born that your done....with my first the pain got so bad i had to be knocked out...with my second i knew what more to expect and was able to go through the whole thing... one other thing! you will find you shake a lot! Just take a deep breath....its just the nerves getting to you. You will be up and walking around the day after...when you get home no walking up stairs keep things close to you...if you can gate your son in the room with you so you dont have to chase him. it gets easier everyday...when you husband comes home make sure he lets you rest and helps out...YOU CAN DO THIS! IT ISNT AS BAD AS YOU THINK! YOU'LL BE GREAT!!! CONGRATS!!!    ANOTHER THING I FORGOT TO ADD WAS WHEN YOU GET OUT OF SURGERY YOUR FACE WILL ITCH DEPENDING ON WHAT MEDICINE THEY GAVE YOU...TRY A WET WASHCLOTH AND GENTLY RUB YOUR FACE.. YOU ALSO MAY THROW UP I DID WITH EACH OF MY GIRLS BUT ITS NOT SO BAD SINCE YOU HAVENT HAD ANY TO EAT SIX HOURS BEFORE SURGERY.|`|EAeffKqSaa	It is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  I had a C-section 2 years ago and will have another one in july.    As long as you listen to the nurse's. When they give you pointers on everything... To put a pillow over your tummy to cough it helps get the muscles back in shape, get up slowly when you need to get up, take warm showers to relax you when you can.    Also before your husband has to go to work make sure your some where comfortable with a TV. All your baby needs, plenty of water, juice, snacks, also turn the phone off or let the machine take messages so you can relax and get to know your little one and have lots of pillows so you don't have to get up to much.     When baby sleeps YOU sleep so you'll have energy to deal with everything else that may go on in your house.     True you may be down for a few days to a couple of weeks but really it is all in your mind.     I was in the hospital for 3 days and when I got home I was up and walking around and going places. I was NOT going to let a C-Section get me down.     My sister had her baby 6 weeks after me and did the natural birth and ended up tearing down there and was NOT walking for a month.    It is not really that bad or scary.   Good luck to you, just relax and enjoy your new little one.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi you will really need help after as some mum's can't even lift their newborn after a  c section! you need to arrange something with your man. i know your scared very new mum is the same. i dont know what its like to have c section but my sis in law had one and she struggled even when her man was there. good luck.|`|hNiKE6Ptaa	ive had 2 and was in the same situations.  Pillows Pillows Pillows.  from coughing, laughing, standing up, feeding, rocking ect ect ect.  Pillows will be a huge help!!!  You will be fine.  Yes it will hurt but yes you will be fine.  make sure hubby helps you prepare everything before he leaves such as bottles, have all baby needs near you so you arent getting up and down more than necessary just cuz it will aggravate your pain.  other than that, youll make it.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	I had an emergency c section 7 weeks ago. It wasn't panned and i to had this beautiful birthing plan.  saying that... when all came to an end it wasn't half as dramatic as i believed it would be. It took me about an hour to get movement back into my legs so i could sit up and cuddle my new baby as much as i pleased. Also they do still pass him to you strait away as they would normally.  after wards.. now you will need help. I stayed in hospital for 4 days after.  when returning home i was still very uncomfortable, you must remember it is still a major operation. I would strongly advise you to have someone over to help. It certainly is not impossible to do it alone but it will make your days a hell of a lot easier. your body needs lots ad lots of rest. you will find bodies become a lot more tired after an operation. even 4 weeks later.    Stairs were a bit of an issue so maybe make sure you have enough of everything up stairs with you so you don't have to travel up and down a lot.  Best of luck! x|`|tHM6TjtIaa	Kelli, I am so sorry! You will be okay! If need be your husband will have to take off of work, however many women dread this and turn out to be just fine. What you MUST remember is to not overdue it! Because if you do you will be re-hospitalized or even have to have yourself sewn or stapled back up which is not good. Make sure to take care of yourself, eat well, drink plenty, and rest plenty. Your newborn will sleep most of the day every day for a good while which will give you plenty of resting time. Trust me when I say take advantage of the time your little one is sleeping and sleep too. I am the mother to 6 children, I didn't listen to this the first 2 times, when I did the 3rd time, I was so much better!    If I were closer I would help ya! I too didn't have any family who were close or willing to take the time to help me...|`|66c5a58dbfeed91c36f0bd3c47d9dd8caa	ok i saw this and had to answer, it is not as bad as you think having a c-section, yeah it hurts like hell as your recovering, but trust me you can do it. im actually going in for my third c-section in may. my  daughter was an unexpected c-section and it was freaky but i made it, and i was the only there to take of me and baby. the first 3-5 days are the worst. with baby 2 i went back to work 3 days after having the c- section. you get used to it, u Just cant work yourself too hard, and remember it hurts like hell to move around at first but the more you move the faster your body will help you heal( i mean do a little more each day...0 but you can do it, its nerves more than anything and i do promise you its scary but once your there you do it. your motherly instincts just kick in. ( and the best part is newborns sleep allot so you can have them in bed with you while you relax and heal :) good luck to you!!!!|`|1bnhwGACaa	ask the hospital if they know of any nursing students or any resources that can help you   some times companies will allow for extra time if they know that you are going to have surgery id have your huby ask about this|`|pi3T9rijaa	Put it this way, I had one when I was only 17, living with my boyfriend in a flat, and 3-4 days after the op I had to get up out of bed, do a stool movement and could be discharged.    My baby did not want to latch (breastfeeding) I didn't know how much formula milk to feed her either as she latched fine whilst in hospital, I couln't get out to see the dr as my boyfriend then upped and left for a whole TWO WEEKS!!! Leaving me alone with baby and a fresh caesarian!!    So - it is doable.  You'll be fine.  It is sore, more sore than the after effects of labour, unless you have cuts and tears I suppose.  Getting up really stings, like a knife cutting through you, but if I could survive it at 17 I'm sure you can however old you are.    It is possible.  It is not deathly pain like the final pushes of labour seem (though I wouldn't know about that) but it is pain for longer afterwards.  You'll bleed for a while after that, I did for 8 weeks after!    Anyway, you'll cope, if baby screams unstoppable, remember to check how much milk he needs and sing to him if it hurts too much to stand up and cradle him.    It's not that bad.  Congrats and good luck with meeting your new one.|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	I, like you, had a "plan" for how I was going the have my child.  However, other plans were made for me.  My son was breech and after repeated attempts to move him into the correct position a c-section was scheduled.  I was devastated.  I think I cried the whole way home from the doctor.  I did not want to have a c-section.  I felt like I would be less of a woman for having my son by c-section.    When I had the c-section, I was scared but it was not near as bad as I thought it was going to be.  You are completely numb-from just below the ribs down but you are awake.  I could hear everything.  My husband was in there with me and the nurses and doctors were super nice.  They even had music playing in background.  My son was delivered in about 10 minutes.  He went to the nursery with my husband and I went to recovery for 2 hours.  When we all met back up, we were in the post partum room.  They kept me on pain meds and a kept a catherter in me for 24 hours.    What sucked the most was that I was on a liquid diet for 24 hours!  I was startving and could only eat broth and lemon jello.  The recovery was not bad.  My sons room is upstairs so I took it easy going up and down the stairs.  He was sleeping in a bassinet in our room so I moved most of his stuff--diapers, changing pad, clothes,--into our room.  Getting out of bed the first few nights hurt but not a lot.  Just take it slow and you will be fine.  The nurses will show you how to sneeze and laugh using a pillow. Have your husband fill your prescriptions the day you leave the hospital because you will not be able to drive for 2 weeks.     Good luck, don't stress!  You will be just fine, hun!  You can email me if you have any questions.
HXfHkoSHaa	That's pretty normal.  As babies get older they sleep less often for longer durations.|`|Hhifw93laa	45 min is great its ok the more the baby sleeps during the day the less it will at night Good luck God bless|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Normal, normal.  Let him sleep when he wants to for now.  His sleep will start to consolidate of its own accord over the next few months.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Um, that's how long 7 week old infants nap - and at 45 minutes that's pretty good.   He will combine his naps as he gets older and they will increase in duration while his waking periods get longer as well, just help him grow.|`|oDVLJAqUaa	maybe try one of those pac and plays or cradles that has vibrating pads in it or a rocking cradle he is still so young it will get easier...just try to rest when he does so that you dont get burned out and flustered...be patient babies can sense everything if you are uneasy they are uneasy...my daughter wouldnt sleep at all when she was an infant my son was an angel...just give your son some time|`|XzhdKsPlaa	Keep on driving, then when you feel tired put him in a pushchair and go for a walk when you feel awake again get back in the car and start  all over again, good luck!!!|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	your baby is normal, I was lucky to get mine to sleep that long.|`|YFmtHNkiaa	he might not be getting enough nutrition so he won't sleep as long. my little brother had a problem where he didn't breastfeed right and he was extremely malnourished. he rarely slept more than an hour at a time. if your boy is very thin and doesn't seem to be gaining weight as he grows, talk to your doctor/pediatrician and see if that's the problem. hope this helps :D|`|O97ZoHGXaa	we keep his room very dark and quiet. we have a mobile that plays a song that he can look at.   every baby is very very different. don't worry he will soon settle into a routine of his own|`|ke0dsgkkaa	Baby could eat more before naps or sleep. I know with their bellies full they seem to rest better. At an early age they should be having at least cereal, liquid form or something. I am keeping a young one now and they were only giving her liquids, I have been feeding her more and she really takes a good nap now and seems more rested when she awakes. Her part time day care has noticed a great difference in her.|`|QJcZ4xnPaa	is he feeding effectively and gaining weight?  If all else seems well then I would imagine he will start sleeping for longer periods in his cot, given time.  7 weeks old is still very young to trying to establish routines (in my opinion - there are many philosophies on raising babies that would disagree).  I have plenty of friends who spent hours and hours walking their babies around in pushchairs for the same reason but I don't think 45min naps are unusually short.  Swimming used to guarantee a couple of hours sound sleeping for my daughter ( I took her from 6 weeks old) and also a session at the chiropractors (I was desperate!!).  It is the motion that soothes them isn't it whilst in a pushchair/car - I used to rock my daughter in a rocking chair, to avoid having to go out all the time.  That said, walking is good to shift the excess baby weight!! Good luck x|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	I can't even get my 7 week old to nap for 30 minutes! But he sleeps good at night. It's normal.|`|deIzFnV8aa	If he takes a pacifier, try giving him that when he wakes up, and making calming shhh noises.    try playing white noise where he sleeps, esp when he gets to the point he usually wakes up. Also, try going into his room right beforeo that point, putting your hand on him, and singing softly/go shhh, what ever you usually do to help get him to sleep to start with.    Keep his room dark and quiet; he is old enough soon to get distracted by the outside world more easily    As a last resort, you can try picking him up and rocking him back to sleep when he wakes. You should usually try to get him back to sleep in his crib first so that he becomes used to that and doesn't always need to be rocked back to sleep.|`|zCWcoFhZaa	Hi 45 mins is quite good for a 7 weeks old, my son who is 5 month old has never been a sleepy baby, I had loads of people say when I was saying that my baby hardly sleeps was telling me that whenever there children had a feed when they were babies they would place them down and they would sleep for a couple of hours and do they same when they wake up etc, and I was like no not my baby, My baby I dont think has ever been a sleepy baby which for me and my hubby is quite good as he sleeps all night as he has been awake mostly during the day.    If your baby doesnt want to sleep he/she wont.my son now is 5 month and 1 week and he fights his sleep like mad and there are certain ways I have to do it if I want him to go to sleep but if he is wide a wake I dont make try and make him sleep as it will just take so long.    As your baby is only 7 weeks you cannot really get you child to be busy playing to make him tired so that he will sleep so all I would suggest is to let you baby sort out his sleep himself you will notice when he gets older his naps will have a time to them etc.

F4iXiZWUaa	No details regarding what way u think she is spoiled. ??  she is a kid she would change may be after going to school. Parents do get worked up every stage their kid grows if its nothing serious its just a part of growing up.  jus be strict when its necessary and be sweet otherwise. Just vary ur approach between the two extremities when the situation asks for.  No violent cartoons or tv shows kids pick up stuff rather fast than elders.  Even family soaps or drama kids shouldn't be watching they get carried away easily.  Just take little care and leave it to her kids grow up fast and  will get accustomed when they go to school or meet kids of their age and mingle!  Hope its helpful!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Say no.|`|AA10097725	dont spoil her obviously your the one doing it so just stop giving her stuff when she doesnt deserve it!|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	Since you are the parent, setting boundaries is your responsibility.     If you feel that you have not been consistent with what you allow your child to do or not do, reevaluate the circumstances and make needed corrections.    If other people are the ones allowing untoward behaviors to develop while your child is in their care, you have the right to ask them to stop doing so.    If they are unwilling to comply, consider alternative methods to correct your child.    Part of her issues is her age, though. Children at about 2 are accustomed to being catered to and the independence they are beginning to develop simply needs to be channeled into the proper forms and outlets.
DKqsFGymaa	He should be drinking about 20 ounces of whole milk per day, 1 cup of juice (so if you water it down it can be two different servings in the day) and as much water as you can get him to drink!|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	He should be drinking up to 24 ounces a day of milk (one cup per meal), and 8-12 ounces of juice total per day.  Milk is good for children, in moderation.  Too much juice or milk will lead to the child being overweight and can cause damage to developing teeth.  Also, too much juice can give your little one diarrhea.  By all means, give him as much water as he wants to drink.|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	Everyone needs to have some plain water each day to help regulate their 'body machine' as it were.    But most fluid intake is determined by thirst and meals that are being served.    If you need specific direction to match your child, call the pediatrician. Not all children hydrate the same way nor are their needs the same.|`|E1ppYqCtaa	He should be consuming as much as he wants of 100% juice, water or a mix of both. Try to steer away from Juicy Juice it will often give a child the runs. But when it comes time for him to eat stall on giving him any at all so that way he will eat more and drink less. You might want to try Welches 100% juice, they have no red dye of any kind(which promotes hyper activity in children) and they use only fruit sugar to flavor it and dyes from fruit to color it lightly.

0Qiscnkeaa	You could have worked yourself up and made your body *think* it is pregnant with anticipation. If the blood test was negative, then you are most likely not pregnant. A blood test will detect pregnancy as early as 8 DPO and you are pretty far from that.    I know the eagerness to get the BFP as we have been waiting for it also. I do get it but I miscarry within weeks.    I say ask your doctor for Prometrium to bring on your period after one more blood test to confirm a negative result. You will take this up to 10 days and then your period will begin. This is what I had to do once.    I wish you the best of luck. Keep your chin up. It will happen when you least expect it!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	If it was only urine tests I would say yes, but bloodwork is 100% accurate.     So probably not pregnant.|`|AA11388636	It still might be too soon to tell. Wait 2-4 weeks to take another test. Good luck.

mNzgWFkGaa	Just as soon as he was able to roll over and start to sit up by himself and move about more i moved him into the cot as i felt it was too dangerous to let him sleep any more in the moses basket.  But 10 weeks seems awfully young to move into a cot , sounds like either your moses basket is very small or your baby very big. or maybe it's both. my moses basket was quite big so i used it longer.  http://www.vertbaudet.co.uk/baby-nursery...  As for being a bit nervous about moving your baby into the cot the link here shows you a thing that can help your baby settle into their new bigger bed , it helps them feel more secure and not so "lost" looking in a big bed.|`|mDkUmEUzaa	Hi    My little fella was about 12 weeks old, we didnt have any problems either - I think he loved moving to his big bed :)    I know some people just put them in from birth - give him a try|`|wKYdIaZVaa	Chloe was about 9 weeks old.

Now she's in her crib at 6 months.|`|N1IQuM1jaa	14 weeks...when i realised that the reason she wasnt sleeping was because she had got too big for basket!|`|O97ZoHGXaa	6 weeks.     i wanted to get him used to his cot and his own room so i put him there for Nap's during the day but he loved it and sleeps much better because the mattress is softer!    our bedroom is so close but we still have a monitor to pick up any noises. We find he also goes back to sleep much better after a feed in his own room.  i was a little uneasy about him being ok but after a few nights you soon realize that nothing bad will come of him. I mean, if he sleeps that well he must be content!|`|deIzFnV8aa	About a month, I think.  As soon as she was nursing less at night, it was nice to move her out of our room so everyone could sleep better w/o waking at every tiny noise.  Since she was so young she made the transition fairly easily.|`|AA11495769	i had mine in  a swinging crib and it says once they start to turn over and move around move put them into the cot|`|Q1RTEDyMaa	My daughter was about 7 or 8 weeks when I moved her from the moses basket to the cot.    She had really started to move around by that age, and because the moses basket was kind of shallow, I really did'nt want to risk her wriggling out over the edge of it in the middle of the night.    Also, I suppose it depends if your baby is big or small, how soon they will grow out of it.    You'll know when to move her/him to the cot instinctively when the time is right.
Axcy1DYlaa	Try explaining to him that you need to nest! it's a part of pregnancy and becoming a mother! the urge to prepare a home for her baby and her family is so real and so strong! you need to explain this to him.     there is no reason you shouldnt be living with him! if he loves you and you guys both agreed to raise the baby together.. then he needs to start providing that home and experience for you and his child.     eventually it's going to be difficult for you to move in! and pack and unpack and you need to get things ready!     What you are feeling is totally normal darlin. all of us preggos go through it. you just need to talk to him and explain yourself and why you feel you need to move in now. Just remain calm and trust that it'll be taken care of. i know it's a lot easier said than done.. but it's true. if he loves you then he will provide for you and help you make this easier.     best of luck and congrats!
cOrbWLjjaa	i'm a little confused, did you get off the pill on jan 2? if so, there is a good chance you are pregnant. it typically takes a month or two for the body to adjust to being off the pill but by no means does that mean you can't get pregnant. You are fertile 3 days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. If you ovulate Jan 22nd, it is unlikely that you are pregnant. But, there is the chance that you didnt ovulate until the 23rd which does give u a shot at being preggers.  Most likely, your body is adjusting to being off the pill. When my friend got off, she did not get a period for 3 months. Take a test to be sure.|`|54q0mJvQaa	First, stop stressing your head off - stress, as all the ladies in this forum know, can delay your period. So calm down, and relax a bit.    If you managed to have sex in your fertile period, and the egg was fertilized, you would be pregnant, than.    I am also waiting to see, because I have no symptoms.     Everyones pregnancy is different, so, maybe your body isnt going to throw every single symptom at you right away.|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	Take a test! With my first pregnancy I didn't get any symptoms for about a week, then the tiredness and sickness really kicked in.     Saying that, I had the most sore boobs from a few days before my period was late, which only got worse as my pregnancy went on (I lost my baby at 8 weeks).    Everyone's different though - some people don't get any symptoms throughout their pregnancies. Good luck - I really hope you get your BFP! xx

ReH5EoR0aa	As a teen I used to bring along a pack of projects to keep the kids busy.        Mostly because it was all new to them, and they were interested.  I would teach them how to draw and cut the drawings out,  or build things with paper, they would get very creative and have a lot of fun making something for their parents when they got home.  Even toddlers can do it.      Also, I learned never disturb a child who is happily playing.  Just keep an eye on them.   No need to interact until they want to.      If I let them watch TV too much they would be naughty.   Something about that flickering picture messed them up.    So, I spent more time playing with real things and they would relax for bedtime.      Had all the kids run around the house 10 times and I timed them with my new timer.   They had a ball and got all their energy off - wanted to  do that every time I came over.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	games, energy, patients, understanding, knowing all emergency numbers, and maturity.|`|ZYEIsoDDaa	her main priority must be the child..    she cannot bore the child, ignore the child, abadon the child or be mean to the child...    the child will most likely want to show your daughter her room and all her toys, it can be boring but she has to be enthusiastic..because its the only thing the child has to offer, the child doesnt want to feel bad because she doesnt have good enough toys for the babysitter...    your daughter should avoid the tv, her mobile, and her personal life whilst babysitting.. these things can become destracting for your daughter and boring for the child..    your daughter must always obey the parents rules...    your daughter must be lovable, cuddly and giggly to get along with the child..    she should always be talking to the child, mostly asking questions, that way the child doesnt feel ignored and feeels like a big person or her friend because your daughter is talking to the child rather then watching tv...    your daughter should also provide games and print colouring in sheets from the internet, and sit down and do the activities with the child.    she should never yell at the child, play a joke on it, tease it, laugh at it or be in any way a teenager towards the child, she has to be a younge person to...    she shouldnt always leave the decision making to the child always the child will think they are in control, but she should also include the child in desicion making that way the child doesnt feel like it is being bossed around...    your daughter should dress in bright and bubble clothes, and always have something new to do every night..    she should be willing to give hugs, piggy back rides, kisses and maybe even have a lie down with the child if she is putting it to bed.    your daughter should always clean up every bit of her mess.. do the washing up, put everything away and maybe even give the childs room a little tidy up just for the parents..      she could have a new activity or what ever every time she baby sits.   like:  -like bringing in photos of her family  -bringing her teddy over  -bringing a book over to read  -colouring in pictures  -toys    anything she can think of..|`|5yZxxeyPaa	Play!

7BsCJMzRaa	It is probably hiccups.  My baby used to get them at least 4 times a day in utero. and they were fast like that, just let you doctor know how long they last for on your next trip to the doctor.  more than likely just hiccups enjoy them take evey minute posible to be in a quiet room and lay down and "feel" your baby move kick or hiccup, it is real great for bonding.|`|G5vGTTqhaa	I think you should go see a doctor|`|9m2opi6xaa	YES! my baby hiccuped constantly when I was pregnant it was so cute to watch my belly do those cute little jumps!

If both your docs are cool with it, you are almost certainly good to go. (It's far more common for docs to tell women (incorrectly)  that they can't breastfeed while on medication.)     I would  plan to exclusively breastfeed for as long as you are able to do so.  If the medication is low risk for baby, there's no reason to start supplementing or wean early. (If anything, the younger the baby the greater the risk, so if you ARE concerned about baby's exposure, you'd be better off supplementing early [and pumping to keep your supply up], and then switching to exclusive breastfeeding as baby gets older.     But, looking at kellymom.com most anticonvulsants seem to be L2, which is very safe, and there's no reason to not breastfeed exclusively from the start, and continue as long as you are able and wish to do so.     So, check kellymom if you're concerned, but if your drug is one of the safe ones, go ahead and nurse your baby.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	If your doctor says it's okay to breastfeed, then it's okay.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	ur aunt im guessing is not a doctor   but i did combation feeds and we started from day 3   just one bottle at bed time and it worked great   and if we were out and he got hungry id give him the bottle   my milk supply ws great and he still was an excellent nurser and i had decied way before that four months was goal to breatfeed till and i did and i am proud     but i say one bottle before that way there used to the bottle and when u do an entire switch it is not so hard    just buy the right bottles   i used avent|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	ummm... I would trust your neurologist and ob/gyn over your aunt... Lots of things do pass through breast milk, but that doesn't mean they are dangerous. I would breastfeed for the recommended 12 months since both doctors say it's fine. Your aunt kind of sounds like a know-it-all to me....    If you don't mind me asking, What kind of medicine are you on? I can look it up for you and let you know more.|`|hGqQIusSaa	You need to find out for sure if breastfeeding is safe while you're on the medication. If you do not get a definitive answer as to whether or not the medication will pass through and could possibly harm the baby, you're safer feeding with formula.|`|IWinNj2saa	Less than 2% of what you consume, gets passed through breastmilk. However, I think you should do a mix from the start, otherwise, your baby might get to be 2 months old, and refuse the formula all together, and then you would be stuck breastfeeding. If I were you, I would breastfeed the whole year though, as it's so much healthier for the baby.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	The doctors, I am sure know much better than your aunt. They are doctors after all.|`|hTQg5tgPaa	Whatever you have during your pregnancy, your child has already been exposed to.  She was exposed even while she was developing all of her organs etc.  the most vital part to human life and growing I think is while they are developing in the mother.  If your drs say that it is ok, I would listen to them since they have had the years of studying and practice, especially if it is coming from an ob.  Your body does not filter anything from the child while in the whom (this is a misconception that people think that the placenta filters the bad from the good, but recent studies shows that it doesn't - same with nursing).  I wouldn't worry about it. If the ob is ok with it you should be too.  Stressing over things just is not good for the baby or you.      Breast feeding is the best thing for the child if you are able to.  They say that you should breastfeed up to 2 years (but I don't think that I am going to nurse mine that long!!!).  That is if you're able and want to.  breastfeeding is really good for the immune system etc.|`|mAsQbiIgaa	My friend is due in March and is in the same situation as yourself.  She has been told it is fine to breastfeed as the baby will not be exposed to any more medication than it was whilst in the womb.    She has though been encouraged to breast feed exclusively for the first while so the baby gets used to latching on etc and then to pump her breast milk rather than use formula for additional feeds.     The only issue her midwife had was tiredness due to the breastfeeding and this maybe affecting her seizures.  Her suggestion was to pump so that the baby could be given a bottle at night and at other times when she was very tired by someone else to give her a chance to rest.      I imagine your aunt is trying to be helpful but I imagine your gyn/ob know best especially as this is the same advise my friend was given.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Why don't you just breastfeed?  If your doctors think it's okay to take your meds while breastfeeding, then it's most likely fine. That's two doctors telling you it's okay.|`|oDyNiJi7aa	I did nurse and it is the best thing!  I would nurse as long as you can then start the mixing if you have to.  Breast milk is the best way to go!  I would go to the WIC office and talk to a breastfeeding coach and she'll be able to walk with you every step of the way!  ~I wish you the best in what ever your choice is!
tFvTW9CXaa	Well, every women is different while some may have very early symptoms others will not have one single one throughout the entire pregnancy. I know how it feels when you have to wait for that two week period to test and see if you are pregnant, anticipation kills...but this is the only way you will know for sure if you are pregnant, often pregnancy symptoms are mistaken for a period or PMS...    I have not had any "real" symptoms and I'm 6 weeks pregnant with  1.   Some of the symptoms are; nausea, vomiting, headaches, peeing a lot, hearburn... and depending on your hormones you could be really happy or very moody. LOL! That's pregnancy, it sucks at first but when you have your little bundle of joy it is nothing but a breeze!    I|`|CUYuAGF5aa	If you had your miss hap round about the time you were ovulating then yes there is a chance you could be pregnant.    The only symptom I had this early on apart from feeling the usual period cramps and tender breasts was that I got tired very quickly.  Everyone is different though as some people have symptoms very early on and others dont have any at all.    Good luck!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	real pregnancy symptoms dont really kick in til you are about 6 - 8 weeks pregnant when morning sickness usually begins.  before this time the symptoms are confusing as they are so similar to pms and stress disorders that it is very hard to pin them down.  the most conclusive is a missed period and a positive pregnancy test. anything else CAN be a sign, but can also be pms.    earlypregnancy.com has a lot of info on the subject, hope that helps|`|gdnL63ngaa	Symptoms differ for everybody.    I have none! The only strange thing was pain in my left nipple. So I thought nothing of it!
24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	you wrote of hating your name as a child then why oh why did you give her a guys name?don't you think she'll be tormented and teased over that through school !well its not too late to give her a cute nickname,or perhaps use her middle name although there's Alot of Mariahs' out there too.she's a cute kid (looks alot like caylee anthony )as far as the pageants i won't judge you.if she enjoys them. i also want to ask you this (probably the most important thing) does beautiful justin like her name?|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Justin I would a assume it's a boy  That is me    You name you daughter a boys name, some people would but and e or an a at the end of the name.  If it happen again, let it go.  IF you think it's matters for her to win, who cares    You are not changing her name    You should not stand up and correct people.  I had someone called my daughter Holly in a crowd, I just let it be.  I know her name is Hayley, she did ask why the person called her Holly.  I said I do not know.  Standing up and correcting this loudly could of cost her the crown    Have you seen the TLC program toddler in crowns?|`|7uy8iy7laa	I think she has an awesome name! :D It fits her perfectly. She's so adorable.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	Take her out of pageants and see if she can do modeling or acting. Then her name would be "just" fine. Be sure that she has fun.|`|230NbPVUaa	I'm sorry to say this but I think that her change in the round had less to do with her name and more with your behavior, I'm sure it was very rude to interrupt the pageant and if it bothered you in earlier rounds you should have addressed the announcer of judges tactfully and in private...It's not fair but all you can do is accept that i may have nothing to do with her name, and try again at the next pageant.|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I have no issue with unisex names.  I don't think Justin is that great of a unisex name, but that is your choice.  As for the pageant, I actually think that your behavior may have been more of the problem than her name.  Also, I think you should think twice about putting not only your daughters picture but your full name on this site as well.  There are a lot of crazies out there and that is identifying information that could possibly allow someone to "find" your daughter if they wanted....IMO  (She is a cutie pie by the way)|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Let this be a lesson to all parents who plan on giving their daughters male names!     There are consequences!|`|Po2UqfvWaa	honestly, she looks like any other 5 year old. there is a famous actress with the name justin. can't remember the last name.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Is this really your daughter? How old are you anyway?    I'm sorry, this all just seems rather childish to me. Justin is a gorgeous name. Are you planning to change it at the age of 5 or something? I tend to believe that would cause much more confusion than it is worth. Leave her name as it is, maybe she just isn't cut out for beauty pageants.    and yes, she is very pretty, but no one can really be "too pretty" for their name. That's ridiculous, sorry.|`|8S8gIJTfaa	I think she is so cute Justin fits her and it was very unfair to make her lose because of her name! but if you want to give  her a girl name try Justeen|`|Org2hdfUaa	She does look like a Justin!     =)    But maybe change her name by deed poll to Justin-Rose or Justin-Ann. You can still call her Justin but for work, school etc. she can be Justin-Rose/Ann    Good Luck!     =)    X|`|odEAUvHDaa	I would just have them refer to her as Justin Mariah when she is in those types of things.|`|d3BZlRyhaa	she is adorable! if they have a problem with the name, then they have to deal, they shouldn't be judging her by her name anyway.. She does fit a Justin. I have never thought of it used on a girl, but its adorable....|`|nkM6wmv6aa	stop entering her in pageants.  you should have given her a girls name. oh well too late for that, but you can still start calling her Josie for short - much nicer.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	She is adorable. But you should not have given her a guys name.    Change it to Justine.|`|Ryiy5sbZaa	She is adorable.  I think Justin is the perfect name for her.  I also think guys names are cute for girls.  What is her middle name?|`|JAEeotdKaa	She Must Have WON|`|olF9Hl6saa	I wouldn't fight it too much. It sounds to me like you may be right about her not winning because of her name... or maybe because of your reaction..but there is no way you can prove it. What is her middle name? Why not refer to her by her 1st and middle name (ex: Justin Marie/Justin Rose/Justine Lynn... whatever it may be). I think Justin a nice name, and your daughter is beautiful.|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	When a child is given an atypical name, there are consequences just as when the name is too common.    Your daughter and you will have to come up with a way to deal with this over the course of her life.    If you are unhappy with the name, add an "E" to the end, legally change it for a new birth certificate and call her Justine.    There was an actress named Justine Bateman on tv years ago...    and by the way, she may have lost because of YOUR behavior at the pageant...just a thought.|`|6h30kGjDaa	Well i think what the judges did was awful and oh my god your daughter is gorgeous  bless her little cotton socks and if you decided to call her justin that's you choice i had a friend called justin she had no problems so im sure your little sweetheart will do just fine although i really do think that she looks like a kelly or abbey (my name ) because i looked EXACTLY the same when i was little its quite scary actually and everyone always used to be able to have guessed my name was abbey and i would say how did you get that and they would always say the name really suits you that's all  and its a pretty rare name there was no one throughout my schools called abbey.    Any good look and i hope you find what you were looking fo.  Luv AbZ XxX|`|X1cYBjyJaa	Ok first of all, i dont think you should have named your daughter Justin. Personally, I, like most other people, think that that name is for a boy not a girl. Second of all, there was nothing wrong with the name Amber. In fact like you just said, there were a lot of people who had the name Amber because why? it was popular. But thats what happened in your life, not your daughters. You were afraid to name your daughter a name that other people have, so you decided to go with a name that is not common for girls. Nothing is wrong with that but you have to understand that when people hear the name Justin, they think it is a boy's name.   I also think you should write a letter to those people at the pageant. They shouldnt have based their judging on somone's name, its not fair.|`|JieuhM9eaa	She is gawjus (: x|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	Awww, she's really cute, i like the name it suits her :)|`|9CAXUgOZaa	Maybe she didn't lose because of her name. You don't know that for sure.   Or maybe it's because you interrupted them that she lost. That seems more likely to me. But honestly, it's a competition, and they're going to judge harsher and harsher as they proceed to the next stages. That could be why.  Though the person saying to call her Justina if you want her to win is a bit weird..    But you shouldn't do anything about it. I guess if you're really upset, you can maybe ask them to explain what went wrong, if it'll make you feel better.      To me, she doesn't suit the name Justin at all. I like some boys names for girls, but definitely not that one. She'd suit a really feminine name, in my opinion. Looking at her pic, she totally suits the name Mariah, but not something as masculine as Justin.    And you gave her that name because you hated your name being so common. But there will probably be other Justins in her class....they'll just all be boys. It's kind of the same to me. I mean, you shared your name with 6 girls...and she might have to share her name with 6 boys. Which is worse, in my opinion.    She's adorable, by the way.|`|iTOCf9Mzaa	Personally i think girls should have girls names, not boys.    She is cute but y dont u call her justine or make mariah her first name, u dont have 2 change it by deed poll just say thats what you would like her to be known as at school and other activities    =D    XX|`|gKW1ufGbaa	Save her a lifetime of problems and call her Mariah. What did you expect? People will think she's a boy dressing like a girl, which is probably what they were worried about people thinking.|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Too bad you didn't think of this when you named her.    Gender-benders always cause some trouble somewhere along the way.    Now that you know this is going to be a problem, why not take her out of the pageant loop? After watching what those children go through, I think it's cruel. Just my unsolicited opinion but now would be a great time to make the break.

umGzyElZaa	It can sit at room temp for 1 hour...says it on the container!  Your not supposed to re-heat, or save it for later if the baby has eaten off of it. Once the baby has eating out of the bottle, harmful bacteria can grow within just a few hours. You need to throw away any uneaten formula after the feeding. Its a waste I know! I hate doing it, but I def dont want my son getting sick!|`|AA11210211	1 hr if it's not refrigerated and 24 hrs if it is.|`|pXSKSS3daa	24 hours if refridgerated.

b3dKghjHaa	Because she is so young, she has a sporting chance of fully recovering.

Maybe because the girl is so young the memory will fade better than it faded for a 12-year old. Who knows.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	its a long road.  she may be fine.  she may have trust issues with everyone.  maybe just males.  she may have issues with her own sexuality (i'm not talking gay or straight here).  she may be uncomfortable with her own body.  she may have issues later on in life w/her own kids (in terms of over protectiveness).  she may be able to work through it.  i personally hate the law that requires a CHILD to take the stand against the accused.  that should not be allowed.  a child should have different rights in that regard.  that may be incredibly hard.   she may have nightmares, flash backs.  she may be angry that no one stopped it.  she may not deal with it and pretend it never happened.  she may never be the same.|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	yes/no...you will always have thoughts about it but things can get better and easy as time passes as long as it is care for correctly|`|850419267f537526b260221ba44cc84faa	That's so sad. I was molested when I was 12. I never fully got over it. I was more upset with my mother and the system than I ever was with my attacker. I felt as if they didn't protect me.

For 10 years, since I was a toddler, my step-father molested me. I finally got the courage to put him in jail and admit what was going on and get therapy. It worked, for a long time I blamed myself and now I know it isn't my fault. The anger is still there though and I am super over protective of my daughter and son and who goes near them afraid that it can happen to them too. It is hard to trust again but she will. It will take a lot of time, therapy and support but she will be ok.

She has a very hard time trust men because of what happened. I mean she seems okay, but she hates talking about it. Her grandfather was sent to jail for 4 or 5 years for the crime and then the court called and wanted her to testify against him again because he was accused of doing the crime again, but she was to scared to do it because she didn't want to face him EVER again. She never did go, but he did get charged again. Thankfully, he's locked up again for an even longer time.     I don't think anybody no matter what age could fully recover from the "abuses" they went thru like that. I mean the image is always going to be in the back of their head. Hopefully she can get the help that she needs to recover from it, but sometimes to get help they need to talk about it or just write. I know when I need to let things go, i write it on paper. Seems like paper ALWAYS listens to you without letting anyone else know. Once again I'm very sorry for what the little girl had to go thru I hope this kinda helps you.
Ccs9LeIEaa	frankie is by far my favorite unisex name. I'm naming my daughter Frankie (Frances, nickname Frankie).    I also like Brett, Dylan and Rory.|`|JieuhM9eaa	Sam  Danni     i |`|578ed1731c2aa943b2af6d8e21fe78f8aa	Unisex names can be cool sometimes, like Mitchelle|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Boys for boys; girls for girls, I say. Don't confuse life for them?|`|IvkNTqDMaa	I HATE unisex names!...prob b/c I have one...my name is Jamie...and I have always hated that...I always wished growing up that I had a girly name like both my sisters.|`|TN72hvpEaa	Halo mom; Are you kidding? "No body like people assuming they are boy when they are girl"  lol. Wow. Anyways,    I am 24, I am a girl...and my birth name is Ryan. I love it. Of course, I had a lot of problems growing up. It wasn't so widespread back then and I either got "Did your parents think they were having a boy" OR "Did your mother name you after Ryan's Hope" Which the answer was No to both questions. They just liked it a lot, it sounds Irish and they said it would be make a strong person, which it has. I am now an adult and I get complimented on my name at least 3 or 4 times a month. :D|`|E1ppYqCtaa	My sons name is Angel.  I love it. You are the parent you do what puts a smile on your face and warmth in your heart.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Last century the names Evelyn, Joscelyn and Vyvyan were all boys' names|`|d3BZlRyhaa	Dylan for a girl is growing on me. i thought it was kinda weird but i like it now    my favorite unisex names are  Taylor  Riley  Jayden  Hayden  :)|`|PF9E2P4Waa	kelly, jesse, i don't like bobby!!!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I think common boys name on girls are dumb, and the girl will have to live with people assuming she is a girl    Ryan, Dylan Evan, Tyler, Logan, Jayden, Kaden/caden are all top 100 boys names, way to common for a girl    Jordan is in the top 100 in both sexes, is a true unisex name    Avery, Riley, Taylor are top 50 girls names, way to common as a girl name for a boy today.  I think it goes both ways    Cameron(b) and Kamryn(g)  Casey is boy, Kasey or Kacie girl  Reece is a boy, Reese is a girl  Names like this that have a male/female Verson are okay    Names like Quinn, Morgan, Brylee, Ansley are unisex names.  I like some better for girls an other for  boys, but could be either    Emerson is a boys name, that is more common that a girl name than boys    I think you need to be aware of naming you girl to common of a boys name.  No body like people assuming they are boys when they are girls|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I strongly dislike unisex names.  I find it just awful that the boys names you have listed are being used on girls.|`|ULxBUoclaa	i love the name Jamie it could be Jamie Marie or Jamie Scott.  Jamie is my personal Fave!|`|YVE64dJUaa	My favourite unisex names are    Jordan-my cousin is called Jordan he's 14 now  Alex  George    Least favourite    Kim (to me sounds more like a female name)|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I like unisex names and flowery feminine names it just depends.  My daughters name is Jordan which is definately unisex.      I love Sam  Shannon
r39EDGhPaa	Depends on the circumstances.  Was it willing? Was she raped?  If it was willing, your *** would be mine.    I sure as hell wouldn't be raising your kid either.|`|zQB0kEmcaa	well I wouldn't be pleased but I would talk it thru with my daughter and husband to find a solution.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	angry at first, then depresses... then worried for my daughter|`|Kg5KX432aa	I would be more disappointed than angry.|`|vrfuO9Asaa	yeah it depends really|`|7rEMTohxaa	depending your relationship with her, she would most likely be dissapointed rather than angry!|`|C3sqTngtaa	dissapointed maybe, depends on the circumstances, are you ok?|`|codyhkAaaa	i wouldnt be mad, she'll probably just be happy that your not such a loser and dont have friends|`|v7pvLLFMaa	Premature teenage conception is not a good idea. She would get pissed.|`|wUkU3HVwaa	not angry, more dissapointed but i'd still be there for them.|`|3gHE7e2Haa	well i won't be babysitting|`|OxoumjYJaa	No. I would try and comfort her cause she would probably be scared to death and then that would ruin your relationship!|`|cSOkd7Umaa	well yes i would, but i'd try and understand as  best i could and try to help her through the awful situation
N1IQuM1jaa	yip, my little girl used to go after nearly every feed, then once she reached about 3 months, it gradually declined to 1-2 dirty nappies a day.  As long as there are plenty of wet ones, im told there is no problem.  Apparently its v.unusual for breastfed babies to get constipated, so if they only go once or twice a day, thats all they need to do!  i guess its just their little systems settling down after the trauma of entering the world!|`|3NyM1cq5aa	Very normal!  I worried when my son did this, and especially when he starting skipping a few days in between poops.  But as they grow, their bodies metabolize more of their food and they don't need to poop as often.  It is very rare for a breastfed baby to be constipated, and as long as his poops are soft you don't need to worry.  Now you get to experience the MAJOR BLOWOUTS that come with not pooing as often!  :-)|`|JnLoHaoAaa	It's totally normal. Nothing to worry about|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	totally, actually its even common in bf babies for them to go up to a week without a poop, so if your baby goes a couple days without a bm, its alright.|`|hTQg5tgPaa	Mine did also after every feed, and eventually they will get less.  I breastfed mine and at one point she was going every 3-4 days (mind you they were quite bigger), they say its fine for a nursed baby to have as little as one bowel movement a week.  Make sure that it is the orangish colour with the seedy things in it (if green, could be that she's not getting enough of the "hind" milk - the fatty part after watery stuff that comes out - 90% of the nutritious part is from the watery part, but she needs the fatty stuff also).  And make sure that her urine is colourless and odorless & has at least 6-8 good wet diapers a day. If she's active and putting on weight I wouldn't worry & twice a day is still very good.|`|hVVALFAPaa	As long as it is a 'baby poop' consistency (not hard or formed) and they do not hurt her, it is fine.    At 8 weeks, most babies go through a growth spurt. She is simply using up more of the nutrients in her food so she can grow. She will probably sleep a bit more in the next few days and perhaps be a bit fussier, then go to a 'normal' pattern.|`|8t8NjjnVaa	It's absolutely fine.  Exclusively breastfed babies (no formula, no solids) do not get constipated.      The frequency of bowel movements is unimportant, it is the consistency of them that is important.  If they are hard balls, then there is a problem.  But if they are runny and sometimes seedy in a breastfed baby, then that's perfect and it doesn't matter how often they "go".    It's very common for babies to begin spacing out their bowel movements as they get older.  Newborns often go several times a day...usually right after a nursing, but as they get a little older, they start to go less often.  And they begin to have major "explosions" in their diaper...meaning everyone in the house may hear it, and it may be so much that it leaks out the diaper.      The only time you need to worry is if her poop is hard balls, it has blood, or she doesn't go for an entire week.  Other than that, she's fine.
a24ef19d34a8e1a074ec6b3f3983a7e6aa	Here are a few ideas from Martha Stewart. They are classy and unique and lots of fun!    http://www.marthastewart.com/photogaller...|`|yzVMzKrpaa	Well, I like the project where you take those little candy hearts and fill in/decorate a cut-out-construction-paper heart.   Also, if you learn to make long rows of hearts for streamers, that is also fun.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	The great thing about valentines day is it can be a super cheap celebration. Hit the Target dollar bins or your local dollar stores. We bought cupid and heart decorations at the Dollar Tree along with heart shaped balloons. The day before we make old fashioned valentines with doilies and construction paper. The day of I make heart shape pancakes for breakfast and we all wear red and pink. We invited the grandparents over for Valentine lunch with consists of red foods: spaghetti, jello heart gigglers, pink lemonade etc. We also make heart cookies. I usually give my kids a small present, like hair bows or a new book.|`|eEK3m1aXaa	This website has some crafts you can do with your little one!  http://www.babycenter.com/0_valentines-d...      ~_~|`|prqrQcd1aa	In my daughter's school (which is also the one i went to) we always decorated shoe boxes for valentines day, then put the cards in there as well as any treats.  You take a shoe box and put aluminum foil, or any kind of paper on it and then decorate it with cut out hearts, etc or even stickers. Make shure you cut a little slot into the top of it to make it more like a mail box type of thing...  You can get heart doilies and place them different places around the house or even hang them from string, even make hearts or other things out of paper and do the same thing.|`|4TNavgDuaa	Tissue paper flowers  http://jas.familyfun.go.com/arts-and-cra...
3WWHWsHOaa	I did have a preconceived notion before I had children. The stereotypical mom in baggy sweats with her hair undone and flip flops always came to mind. As well as a dirty home, frazzled mind, and longing to be away from the hectic home.     As I had children and grew older I realized the world isn't stereotypical. Few people fall into the molds society wants them to portray.|`|rS3n7dO9aa	i got 4 kids and i look pretty good|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	No notions whatsoever.  I may however get jealous if they look awesome and I look like crap and they way more kids than me.  i don't except them to look terrible or anything like that.  I would hope i never walk out of the house looking terrible.    I do however agree totally w/nina.  someone said that to me "she looks good for having 2 kids"  that ticked me off.  so if i hadn't had 2 kids I would look like a dog? hello!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	This reminds me of that popular comment...... "You look great... for having __ kids".  WTH does that mean anyway??????  I agree w/ you 100%!!!    ETA:  VERY rude!!!  Now, when I see a mother with a very young newborn, going on 2 hours of sleep and she looks beyond great.... then I can understand the comment.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	what they mean is you don't look sufficiently harried and exhausted.  just gracefully accept the compliment, carrie.  ;-)    but seriously, no, i don't, because often parents of lots of kids have so many because they love kids.  so they don't necessarily look more harried and exhausted than the parent of one who isn't loving it.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Well, I guess maybe people think that a mom of many might have gray hairs, might look really tired, might not always be dressed like a million or whatever.      Personally, I don't think that.  I think that you can never really tell how many kids a person has.  Moms come in all different shapes, sizes, financial backgrounds, educational backgrounds, etc so you can really just never tell.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Hmmm now that I think about it, I do have a preconceived notion of what a mom of multiple kids would look like. I think a mom of two or three would look the same as a mom as one, but a mom of four or more I would imagine as looking more run down, not always perfectly dressed and with hair in place... maybe the clothes a little shabbier because four or more kids can be expensive. That's not a very good assumption, now that I think about it.    I'll have to ask my mother-in-law when she flies in this weekend. She's very neat and trim now but I don't know if she looked tired or run down  when she was chasing after four kids all under the age of 8.|`|j2mRop0laa	No. I can't say that has ever crossed my mind. lol  Although, I get told on occasion that I don't look like a mom, it actually hurts my feelings and I'm embarrassed that I look very young. I try to be sophisticated and do my make up very maturely. ha ha|`|AA11210211	I agree what is there a certain MOMMY of " " LOOK or something!!! I get "oh are those your kids,you don't look like you have had kids" all the time because I am so tiny,It's like okay so because I am tiny means I don't have children?? I think people now days over emphasis peoples looks way to much.
7oNpIf4Naa	No sweetheart, your not going crazy.  I'm excited for yu that you picked the 27th because that is my son's birthday.....You need to just take a deep breath and relax, trust in the lord that everything will be ok.  Remember how it was last time and I bet you were nervous then to but when your child was in your arms all that stuff went away right?  I know it did for me, I have 3 children and each time I was a nervous wreck but when I got to see that precious face I forgot all about it.  Try and focus on the excitement of being a mother again and welcoming your new little bundle of joy.  You will do great and so will the baby... Goodluck|`|oWKOlJyjaa	Well I have felt this way before, but not about c-sections, I'm only 16 afterall. It is a psychological thing. Whenever I have to get a physical at the doctor, I pass out when I get shots, because my mind makes me believe that the pain is going to be the most excruciating pain in the world. I know that it's not, like I'm fully aware of what it really feels like, but I still couldn't help it. Same goes with my mom. If she doesn't know where she is, in a surrounding town near home, she'll have an anxiety attack, with the full knowledge that if she keeps driving for a little while, she'll hit a main road and navigate just fine. To me, it's not a big deal at all, I would be perfectly calm. My mom even agrees that it's absolutely ridiculous. I also have this fear, this feeling that if I get bit by any kind of spider, I will end up half dead in a hospital. I know it's completely outrageous, though.   Sometimes our minds make things seem much worse than they are, thus making our fears grow. As long as you are aware of the situation, and know the actual reality of what's really going to happen, keep telling yourself that you will be okay rather than dwelling on the what-if's. Doing that will just make matters worse, trust me. Think logically. What are the chances you will die from a c-section, or lose your baby?|`|7iMZ91K7aa	Well, you know deep down that nothing bad is going to happen to you... we live in the year 2009 with all sorts up updates in technology in the best hospitals.. your going to be fine. I can only imagine that your just anxious and nervous about the whole thing.. Just relax and know that everything is going to be just fine!!! GOOD LUCK|`|ROJans2Taa	all throughout my pregnancy I was one big nervous wreck, my doctor actually was going to put me on meds if I didn't calm down,lol. by the end of my pregnancy I was so worried he was going choke on his cord, which the doctors told me was rare, and I had no reason to think that my son would have a problem. everyone would tell me to relax, think of other things, but honestly once you've envisioned something terrible, it's hard to forget, my son was born just fine, no cord problems,lol. my advice, take one day at a time, try really hard to focus on whats happening at this moment, easier said then done, I know, im wishing you the best.|`|79eRDIbXaa	No your not Crazy, your just a worried Mummy!!!  Stop stressing Im sure everything including you and your baby will be fine.  Good Luck xx|`|cypZ0ykXaa	relax dear! everything will b alrite. u had  a ceasarian before & know how it feelz. so calm down.yur baby will b alrite & safe. u'll b playing with him soon. think only 'bout the moments u'll spend with him once the little one arrives. watch & read only good . i had a c-section fro my first & now 23 weeks preggy and u know even i get nervous sometimes but then i think i 've gone through all this.no matter waht i wont stress myself for this."good luck dear"|`|kqnaqakLaa	take deep breaths and keep it together. you've been through this before. leave it up to the doctors. Stress can cause a lot of problems in a pregnancy and development of the child. You're already at 8 and a half months, you should just take it easy, and relax. take a nice warm bath. everything is going to be alright.|`|98WKYtfwaa	No, you're not going crazy. It's completely natural to be scared and worried.     You just need to try and think positive, althought that's easier said than done.    If you get an epidural or spinal block instead of getting put to sleep then maybe that would ease your mind of dying?|`|E5zzDwoBaa	that is totally normal to feel that way. but try to calm down because you dont want to stress out your baby. everything will be okay. the doctors are skilled and they will take care of you and your baby.  just relax. you should be excited to see your baby. just think about the good things. congrats! and good luck!!  remember........relax....|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I too had a c-section and may have to have another one and I am also nervous and I think the reason I was not nervous the first time is because it happened so quickly that I didn't get a chance...no we have time to think about it and of course all the worst scenarios go through your head but they are pretty safe now a days so just try and relax.|`|AA10976951	I had an unplanned c-section with my daughter and we will be having a scheduled c-section with our little girl that is due in June.  With my first daughter I had been in labor for a very long time (32 & 1/2 hours) and getting the epidural was not an issue for me because I was just ready for the pain to stop so I could rest.  This time I will not have hours of pain to take away from getting that needle put in my back.  I'm nervous but my husband just keeps reassuring me and I know that he's right everything will be fine but I just can't seem to help it.
ZbnxGIsnaa	I'm not sure, but if he's only basing this on your boobs, then I'd find another doctor for a second opinion.
s30Duwdraa	NO!!  Don't take anything until you talk to your doc!      The guy you went to sounds like a real loser.  Discharge is something that happens to most women when preggers.  I urge you to wait until you get the ok from your doctor!  he may even tell you that the loser was wrong in prescribing anything at all!!|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i would suggest the same thing what others have said...don't take them...just ask your regular OB and she will give you some good advice on what to take & what to not..    hope i have helped..!!|`|IecRl5wMaa	go to your OB. Dont take the medication. He is obviously stupid because discharge is normal.|`|e5O7hQb8aa	i wouldn't take them without asking ur regular doctor.|`|VS8mactUaa	Definately, substain from those medications until you talk to another doctor, your ob doctor.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Discharge is normal but not discharge that smells weird. It sounds like you have a Bacterial Infection of the Vagina. Metronidazole is a category B in pregnancy which means it is safe. Miconazole is Monistat which is also safe for pregnancy. It is on my safe list from the OB. If you told the Dr that you were pregnant, they wouldn't give you something that is unsafe to take. You can call your OB/GYN and ask to be sure but I am sure they will say both medications are fine.|`|mxixfE3Raa	There should be a leaflet with them, which will say if you can take them or not if you are pregnant.  Good Luck|`|paerqxfMaa	Are you certain you are pregnant?  Sounds more like a vaginal infection to me.  Most doctors - OB or otherwise - know about pregnancy issues.
99Dvcw29aa	i like unusual names usually, but theres definitely a limit. they just want theyre child to be recognized and remembered easily. they dont want to see their child playing on the playground and saying "Julia, its time to go home" and get responses from several different kids. also, some names mean special things to people, and as unusual as they may be, the parent loves them.     the strangest name ive ever heard is some poor sad person a couple weeks earlier asked if the liked some very long and ugly and hard to pronounce Japanese name that started with a K, like Kuusqucki or something, and said it meant vampire in Japanese. i thought that was absolutely sad.|`|4LvtYgvRaa	Satsuma for a girl|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I personally like unique name but i do agree they should have a some what common name to go along with them. My daughter will be Brooklyn Marie ( i think its unique but not ridiculous). And some people say its too unique just because they don't like it, there is a difference b/w different and not your taste.     The craziest name i heard was Japonica. (jah-pon-ick-ah)|`|gKW1ufGbaa	Honestly the parents are craving attention and have been their entire life. They don't want their own children to have the same fate or to feel average so they think they are making them special or unique just by giving them the name. It's all textbook. I knew a woman who named her daughter Peaches. That was pretty bad.|`|BKr3y30maa	I am a big fan of General Hospital. Anyways, one of the stars on there, he and his wife named their son...........PEANUT!!!!!  Poor boy is going to be picked on forever.|`|dvfeBZtZaa	Two people in the UK in 2007 named their child Superman.  In 2006, one parent named her two boys and one girl Nike. All three of them.|`|KXfGa4Quaa	because parents are on crack these days...    Anitia Johnson is a funny one haha|`|9CAXUgOZaa	"In 2006, one parent named her two boys and one girl Nike. All three of them."  HAHAHA    Ugliest names would belong to Frank Zappa's kids - Moon Unit, Dweezil, Ahmet Emuukha Rodan and Diva Thin Muffin Pigeen. Ew.|`|CXDuaWjFaa	They are idiots, that's why. They think they're making some kind of freakin statement, I say it's child abuse!!    Seriously, like Ashlee Simpson's kid- Bronx Mowgli?  And Gwen Stefani's Zuma? I thought that was a drink or something. The kids are lucky are lucky they'll have money for body guards bc those names just scream "kick my a**!"    Zuma Nesta Rock, weirdest name ever. Oh and Pilot Inspektor, some actor has a kid named that.. My Name is Earl guy, I think. And of course, Tu Morrow. Seriously, call DSS.|`|oWKOlJyjaa	Okay, I do understand that, but some parents just take it to the extreme. It's only okay if you have a beautifully unique name, not flat out wierd!! Who names their child Pirate, or Apple? That's unique because no one would dare name their children after objects!! I'm talking about names like Spencer, or Xandria, or Siobhan (pronounced shuvon). I love Irish and Gaelic names they are absolutely beautiful. But I do like the name Star, and Raye or Rayne. All girl names though. I had this strange obsession with the names Burnadette for a girl and Tristan for a boy a few years ago. I like them now, but I wouldn't name my children those names. I was thinking of names my first daughter Siobhan Rose or something along those lines. Definitely an Irish name. I have to have atleast one child with an Irish name =]|`|8mchLCQhaa	I hate Piper and it is so popular! Why|`|qr8yxOBfaa	GodIss that is lil mo's daughter's name|`|Elxuvon8aa	I agree that some people want to be creative and come up with just weird of odd spellings it makes it difficult for the kids.  I knew a little girl named Pebbles  I laughed thinking it was a nick name but it was not.  My daughter had a friend names April May her Mom called her by both so she was teased with June July etc.|`|Fk9RN6taaa	Well, David Duchovny(sp?) named is kid "Kyd" with a y.  and someone else(I forget who) named their kid Pilot Inspektor.  as if "Inspector" wasn't bad enough, they had to switch the c with a k.|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I think that people are so interested in being different that they just don't think ahead.  I think that celebrities are the worst too.Bronx Mowgli?  I think either would be fine as a middle name (give the poor boy a choice) but give him something normal too!  I don't know if that is the worst tho...
nuT4GDTEaa	Yes u can still have a period. My mother had a period for 4 months while pregnant w/ me.. so it is possible...Good Luck : )|`|DNygQdmVaa	Not very likely.    take a test.|`|8lchebCNaa	for a few months not the entire pregnancy
o8xNTVWTaa	very possible u become VERY fertile after having a miscarriage   and u can become pregnant very soon after   GOOD LUCK hope u get ur bfp   baby dust !|`|H74F8jxuaa	Supposedly you are very fertile after a miscarriage, that is why you are supposed to wait because you can get pregnant so quick.  Take a test in a couple of days.
zhk8o514aa	What a sweet loving caring mother you will be...|`|ISKM1z8iaa	Yes, it looks like an alien!|`|q7HvkRpyaa	It's not scary. I think it is pretty neat. My doctor's office never took a picture where you could look at the baby like that. All I ever got with both pregnancies was a side view, until I had the 4d one done at 30 weeks with this one.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Looks like a normal early scan... all baby's look like that at this stage.  Keep in mind, the baby has a lot of developing to do yet!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	normal not scary give it a few months than see ahhh|`|C4bxnKDXaa	haha! it looks like a normal ultrasoiund picture...dont be worried I am sure he will be a beautiful baby. I was worreid too for my kids when I saw the ultrasound pics...you are in the unknown now so you will learn.|`|C7frzO9Jaa	yes a little bit  but if the doctors say all is well  then listen to them  and best of luck|`|njLVIp55aa	HAHA no..they all look like that at that age!! lol!!    Dont worry he/she will turn out adorable!|`|IWinNj2saa	Honestly, it looks like an alien. Are you sure thats your ultrasound?|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Aww, haha! A little, it is just the angle they got the image from! I think "it" will be a beautiful baby by the end!|`|0VHolTVEaa	No its absolutely fine. Remember its only 12 weeks so has alot of developing yet until 40 weeks so dont worry. It will look different on your 20 week scan. Just enjoy being pregnant and stop worrying.

Go back to school..|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    your baby doesn't looks scary...for sure as in the starting the baby doesn't looks like a human you must have read this in pregnancy sites & books so there's nothing to worry but must say your scanner took a very nice picture its so close & clear..    i hope you are feeling okay now & hope that i have helped..!!|`|8uiH6iRbaa	lol    no i don't think its scary x|`|UiqRVbRGaa	no|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	No. Ultrasound photos are not an exact science and the positioning of the baby in relation to the umbilical cord and other internal features can affect the image rendered.|`|KV7OGaJbaa	I see what you mean but what a great picture of baby! Someone's been posing for the camera, haha!|`|4bvq4IAxaa	Why the hell would you say your baby looks scary???? You are an awful mother.|`|zsiuJbnuaa	No, not at all.  I was even creepier. Lol!|`|aoa4jCjdaa	yeah it does    it looks like and alien reaching out to get you!!    im sure it wont be as scary wen it comes out though lol|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Looks like an alien - kinda creepy    but don't worry, ultrasounds that early are always odd looking.    When I had mine, my baby moved and it made him look like a goat child with a hoof for a hand.  But we've had more since then and he has no hoofs, LOL.    Just enjoy your new experience!|`|4QSsJ23Caa	LMAO..u r only 12 wks, the baby isnt fully developed so take that into consideration. Have you seen what babies look like in different trimesters??? There is no need to worry. and whoever said yes to this is an idiot.|`|XwjjKkPCaa	thats a class photo!|`|5UIdcMgIaa	He will be beautiful kid:)  When s-he will born , will be a beautiful human, believe me, :)  He is developing now:)  Dont worry  And love him/her, give everything what You can to make a kid happy.:)!|`|260f178c6fc34e7d0c73b917e2a51e55aa	That Same_but_different, is a Fcuking idi0t, this picture is a face on pic, usually its side on which is why it looks strange, I saw my baby face on at 12 weeks and 20 weeks and he looked just like that, iv just had a 3d scan at 31 weeks and i can assure you he is such a cutie!! Looks nothing like he did in the other scans, you will have a beautiful baby!!!    xx|`|N1IqgXfvaa	Aww my gosh so cute! Thats a great scan photo, usually they get from the side so i think it's cool to see a face on one.|`|A68od1sbaa	my friends scan was like that.  she thought she was having an alien  lol|`|4X6MwQJRaa	Wow what an amazing ultrasound pic!  Doesnt look scary .. looks great.  All babies look like that at that stage so dont worry.|`|c7cf72298a7b440a9bcaa961b4b36e6aaa	lol...not at all girl. ur only 12 weeks, bound to look wierd!! when my daughter was born i said she looked like a wrinkly old man. she's 3 now and absolutely gorgeous. best wishes, hope everything goes well for u both. x|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Sorry, but it looks like a normal cute foetus to me. Nothing scary about him/her at all. The first scan pic is special. Frame it or put in a pregnancy diary!|`|GZn5VNlSaa	OH MY! I'd give anything to have an ultrasound of my baby looking like that.   Cherish it, and don't try to find something wrong w/ it!|`|mz2xU3ABaa	no, its gorgeous!!!!, all the bones you can see just tells you your little baby is growing perfectly :)|`|sQh5brGUaa	my twins look exactly the same as that..( well the one was lookin straight at us like urs,the other was a bit shy..lol..)|`|KsPp27CYaa	OMG hahahahah. thank God u showed the picture...my scan is on the 20th of march..now i knw wat to expect.....thats is so creepy though.....as a first time mother...dnt worry though aparentely thats wat they look like at 12weeks......will show u mine wen i go for the scan...........
vJEatJFPaa	Go get your blood drawn by your docotor to find out.    I am mildy hypothyroid. All hyperactive cases always burn out to hypo's.....    Once you find your diagnosis and get proper treatment you'll feel much better..Before I got on my synthroid I was lathargic, couldn't focus, and always wanted to sleep. I even had bad emotional ups and downs..Your thyroid is like you metabolic control center.....Once it is off your whole body is out of whack..    As far as your fatigue you could very well be anemic too. I was...A blood test will be able to confirm everything. Good Luck!|`|oX4mg0ghaa	Yes get your T4 and T7 tested (blood). The heartbeats sound like palpitations to me (i have this). I hope everything goes good for you.
SEzIkGNiaa	Sweden, Finland, Norway, Cyprus, Austria, Latvia, Denmark, Bulgaria, Croatia, Israel, Iceland, Germany, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Greece, Chile, Netherlands, New Zeland, Portugal, Spain, Costa Rica, and Venezuela.    I live in Canada: Spanking allowed but restricted, only children between 2 and 12 may be spanked and only with an open hand|`|aLwrpMPXaa	OMG ! To the second answerer: I was born in Uruguay and trust me, over there it is not illegal at all ! Not even on the streets ! LOL !!!|`|YjDLOFzQaa	I'm assuming all countries probably follow the same|`|ifSWXqU5aa	Sweden and Isreal are two I can think of. Hopefully the U.S. will follow suit.    Spanking can cause children to be sexually aroused because the buttocks are an erogenous zone which have nerve centers linked with the genitalia. When struck, this can be stimulated. This can lead to the child having S&M tendencies later. Therefore it should not be used as discipline.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I'm in the U.S.A, I don't know if it's illegal to spank you children, but yeah if you leave any kind of a mark it's considered abuse and you're in trouble. I'd smack mine on the butts. One of my sons would for whatever reason just totally get out of hand when we went to the store; running around and messing with stuff. I would smack his butt right in front of the store observation cameras. I figured if they had been watching they would understand ! They were probably thinking...she should have smacked him a little harder!
SLSX6QQsaa	So measure it to see if its really getting bigger.  I didn't have a baby but I'm gonna use me for an example...I gained 10 pounds in the past 6 months. I look smaller than I did, but I know its because my mid section finally caught up to my big butt, now my butt looks smaller in comparison to the rest of my body. It used to look big because I was smaller all over.  So maybe the rest of you is getting smaller and making your stomach look big?!|`|tZt7fUYYaa	lol....i answered before. someone said about redistribution of weight and im going with that. my belly was super flat after a week pp and now i am flabby again and hate it. but am still losing weight. Its ridiculous.
MQ34YW28aa	Yes thats happening to me also. i had my son 9 weeks ago. Granted i'm a little heavier, but not that big. I've lost all the weight I gained from pregnancy (45 lbs) and I still don't look like me i don't think. my old pants and stuff fits and everything, but i still feel like my tummy is bigger. Probably will always because it was sooooooo stretched out. But I always feel bloated right now too, my stomach gets all hard and I feel and look i'm pregnant again, lol.|`|ClC962UDaa	Your stomach might look bigger because your uterus hasn't shrunk down to its pre-baby size yet, but the skin and tissue around it is getting smaller. You are probably losing it in other places as well like your butt and legs, arms and face, maybe even your breasts if you aren't breast feeding. Breast feeding causes the uterus to shrink down faster, but if you aren't breast feeding, this can take much longer.|`|8t8NjjnVaa	Are you breastfeeding or bottlefeeding?  Breastfeeding helps to contract the uterus back to its original size and it also burns calories.    If you are bottlefeeding, you didn't get the benefit of the uterus contracting and it may take longer to get back to its original size.  Also, if you are bottlefeeding, it may be possible that you are ovulating or about to menstruate.  That would explain the bloating.  (Ovulating/menstruating this early would be unlikely if you were exclusively breastfeeding).    In either case though, one thing that comes to mind is that you are losing the weight, but it's not coming off in fat, it's coming off in water (that your body holds onto when pregnant) or muscle mass from lack of exercise.  The best thing to do would be to get some exercise, so that any weight you do lose would be in fat, not muscle.|`|b9f6270ee917e821978bd4443a31ac48aa	Wow. The cramping I'm not sure of.  But usually your weight is redistributed around your body so you do look bigger.  Better get those cramps checked out though if they last more than a week.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	oH MY GOODNESS...i was thinking this yesterday, i lost about 19 pounds about 3 weeks after birth and yesterday i was looking at my tummy thinking, it looks fatter. I cant think why. Im b/f so shouldnt theoretically have a period...at least i hope not...its not fair. Im eating less so shouldnt be fatter. :-(|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I gained 35 lbs with my first pregnancy within 6 days of delivery I had lost it all, and yes I looked pretty much like I did at 7 months.   Your cramping is probably exactly that, cramping.|`|AA10186411	I know the feeling.  I weigh less now than I did before I got pregnant, yet I look much bigger.  The weight is just all redistributed now I guess.   What we go through to have kids! lol|`|ddP3klT3aa	Could be fluid. Once you have the baby the fluid goes every where! Just give it some time. Try to lay off the sodium. I would think after 9 weeks it would be gone. Could be bloating.|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	Could you be pregnant again? Just a thought!     It takes time for some women belly to go down. Also your digestive track is not normal yet and could have something to do with that. Make sure your have bm every day, stay away  from bloating food and give it time.     best of luck
AA10643913	Brodie is a Scot girls name. I don't think he'll thank you for that!!!|`|tZt7fUYYaa	brody....ie seems girly|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Brody looks more Masculine    I like the spelling Brodie better    I might go with Brody Thompson, because it looks more masculine|`|AA12318686	F. Y. I. , Brody is Ukrainian, see Wikipedia.      But aside from that, I think that generally boy names are spelled with a y and girls names like this , with ie.|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	Brody looks better for a boy. IMO|`|FKzFx3mDaa	Personally, I think the "y" on the end is a bit more masculine than an "ie."  Brodie tends to point more towards a girl. But I love the name for a little boy! Brody Thompson is a lovely name! I hope that this helped!|`|cn2rvsdOaa	Brody|`|odEAUvHDaa	y|`|YseGAHIfaa	Brodie Thompson|`|eLhWgghwaa	With the y :)|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Brody    Brodie looks more feminine.|`|9CAXUgOZaa	I knew a girl called Brodie, and there was a girl in a TV show called Brodie as well, so to me it seems like the more feminine spelling.    So I'd go Brody Thompson :)|`|YhjFiVGyaa	brody...it looks more professional and lesws 'cute' for when he grows up to be a man.    i wouldnt like seeing a guy spell his name with an ie at the end lol|`|F44b2np9aa	Defintely with a y - it looks much more masculine!    Brody Thompson - is great:)|`|3qa3BftUaa	Brodie looks better when its written|`|JieuhM9eaa	Brody Thompson. Such a cute name ! x|`|iTOCf9Mzaa	Brodie|`|BP5ykmAmaa	brody with a y, ie looks more feminine|`|FK8gNlx0aa	Brodie Thompson =]|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	brodie looks better thats the one i would choose|`|qUV0xKu9aa	Brody because alot of girls with unisex names that end in eee use ie instead of y like Cory Kori or so...|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	Brodie :)|`|v1uNUcwCaa	Brodie|`|TAufQoc7aa	Definitely Brody. Its more boyish and strong. The ie in my opinion makes a name feminine    x|`|4QSsJ23Caa	BRODY|`|TN72hvpEaa	Brody|`|oWKOlJyjaa	I like Brodie.|`|qXq0nmBzaa	I'm not fond of the name but I'd stay with "Y".    Typically, when someone wants to co-opt a male name and use it for a girl, that "Y" would be changed to "ie". Therefore, many people would be confused and think that Brodie is a girl.|`|SAVkfNs4aa	brody  or BRODE eee|`|pV1vhEvAaa	Brody Thompson|`|b94cb04c4184739772bf1ca1f1903304aa	i think you should go with Brodie! Just my opinion but good luck with it!|`|8U3UY0T1aa	brodie|`|rDoI0MIraa	Brodie, hope it helps x|`|VBWfP0Vdaa	Brodie
T8ksKCWCaa	Yes, that is normal.
9CAXUgOZaa	4 weeks is still a lot of time!    My brother and his girlfriend only started looking for names seriously when she had about 2 weeks to go.     I think you should keep looking for names on your own and just ask what he thinks about them. It's not that hard for him to give a simple yes or no. Tell him that you hate the name. It's not fair if you have to stop looking cause he's decided.   What name did you choose, btw?|`|be5IoBEmaa	Drop it.    Not permanently, mind you.  Just for a few weeks.  (Assuming your child doesn't arrive sooner!)    Get your list together, torture your loved ones and surf the web for ideas and conversation.  But respect his need for a break.    My husband threatened to rebel when I wanted to add a second middle name for our daughter. (Or change the whole thing.)  The same thing happened with my first pregnancy.  I kept pushing; he dug in his heels.  And I ended up with a name that still feels incomplete to me.    So with my daughter I backed off.  And after a few weeks, I brought it up again.  I handed him a short list - including some OUTRAGEOUS suggestions I knew he would shoot down immediately.    To my relief, he agreed to my first choice.    Men are fabulous, but they are FAR less interested in baby names most of the time.  :)|`|faPKwClPaa	Do NOT cave, and do not name your baby something you hate -- you'll always regret that.    I have no idea why he's digging his heals in about the names (uh, there are bigger fish to fry, buddy), but tell him you want to revisit it and if he doesn't want to participate, his loss -- pick a name YOU like.|`|Kg5KX432aa	don't let him decide. You're the one pushing the thing out of you, if anything YOU should have the final say lol|`|OHfZFR31aa	You need to find a name you both agree on. Why do you hate the name you actually chose 3 months ago?     If he won't discuss it, then tell him you are carrying the baby for 9 months so you get to decide on a name since he isn't interested|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Ryan is an Irish Last Name.  My maiden name is Ryan  Ryan is also a boys name not a girls. I do not know any girls named Ryan i knew plenty of boys names Ryan|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I personally don't think Ryan sounds like a girl's name but that's me. I say that, if he won't discuss it anymore, you come up with some other names you like and when you're in the delivery room or after your baby is born, you bring it up to him. My friend's mom did that and she got her way. The father usually doesn't care and just goes along with the mother at that point. Just an idea.|`|GUFb4TZVaa	write him a letter explaining you do not want to call your child that name anymore, and suggest some new names on the letter, that way he will have to read it without any confrontation|`|q1Swxe3qaa	After my dad saw my mom in labor for so long with my sister, he let her pick whatever name she wanted!!     Name the baby what you want. Maybe try to mention names that you like when he is around? Maybe when you due date is closer he will start listening again!|`|HWtG9dkzaa	Well this is a difficult one - as your both responsible for the creation of the child - and therefore you both need an equal say in what the child is called.    Tell your husband that you want to think the names you choosen - and explain to him why you no longer like the name orginally picked out. Your husband may like it - so perhaps opt for it to become a middle name.|`|NJU2XWu8aa	don't cave. when you get a divorce from this pig-headed brute you'll be sorry you caved in and went for the name he chose.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Then keep thinking of names.That is not right.He does not have the right to say ok that's the name.You can keep talking about it until the baby is born.|`|t1NmFX3Kaa	Ryan is a boy name and in no way a girl name. I personally think Ryan is a great name. But if you don't like it you have to get him to talk|`|iLfnhmEcaa	as my mom says "you push it out of you, you get the final say on the name"
CXDuaWjFaa	Boy, all the way. If I ever have a son, it'll be Ryan. The giving girls boys names fad is so stupid. I'm sure little girls love the first day of school when the teacher calls a boys name and she raises her hand and everyone giggles.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	BOYS|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	well my sons called Ryan so hoping its a boys name :O|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Ryan means King  It's a to 20 boys name for more than 30 years  It's way to common of a boys name    Riley is way to common of a girl name for a boy today    I do not like naming girls common boys names    If I saw Ryan, i would assume it's a boy  Ryanne I would assume it's a girl|`|q82cqg3raa	BOY's!! It's horrible on a girl. What's next? A baby girl named Christopher coz "it's cute"?|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	100% Boy|`|pbfkYJ2daa	ryan is definitely a boy's name.   ryanne looks girlie and weird.|`|zbjaBgyEaa	I had heard that too - that it was a 'unisex' name.  I really do much prefer it on boy's.  All of the Ryans I've met have been boys.  It's just a very masculine sounding and looking name to me.  I don't see it as appropriate for a girl.|`|23MPcnNqaa	THANK YOU for saying you heard a lot of girls using the name!!    You just proved my point to my husband.|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I definately think Boy when I hear Ryan but I actually think it is a rather pretty name for a girl too.  I don't have a problem with unisex names.|`|xcd9k8evaa	boys name without a doubt.|`|d3BZlRyhaa	I think it is more of a boys name... too masculine for a boy...that's just my opinion|`|99Dvcw29aa	adorable on a girl. on a boy its not bad.|`|ewDKMeJkaa	Boy definatley|`|FKzFx3mDaa	Hey! Primarily it is considered a boys name. I don't know of any girl named Ryan, but it may work for your child. Personally, I would use it as a middle name instead of a first name. But it sounds sporty, strong and unique for a girl. I like it!|`|IvkNTqDMaa	BOY!!!|`|08kH822qaa	definitely boy name|`|DVqZ8oHjaa	Ryan is actually a unisex name|`|kCiizn5oaa	Its traditionally a boys name. Ive yet to meet a female Ryan.|`|pbQH9HyCaa	i think more of a boy name|`|urarletqaa	Ryan is definitely a boys name.|`|TN72hvpEaa	Well, considering Ryan is my name & I'm a girl I say it's unisex. Most people in this country closed minded and biast when it comes to names. It's still so "weird" and "not right" to name your child with a uni-sex name but it's ok that celebrities use names like Apple or Coco. Come on......    Ignorance. I was named Ryan because my parents thought it was beautiful. It has made me a strong women and I get complimented all the time on it.|`|tcsy9b0waa	Boys name. Parents need to put themselves in their children's shoes when naming them. Some of these names now days are so strange.|`|VxZHkMzwaa	boys namee !  i suppose it could be a girls name if it could be spelt ryanne and pronounced ri-ann or maybe pronounced like ree-anna ?  but ryan deffo a boys name.|`|iTOCf9Mzaa	Officially     Ryan is a unisex name    Ryann is a girls name    I think they sound like boys names tho xx|`|q1Swxe3qaa	I think Ryan is a boys name, although I do know a girl named that too. I think Ryanne is a girls name because it is pronounced Ry-ann.|`|9CAXUgOZaa	I HATE Ryan for girls. Definitely a boys name to me.|`|R9utN0Y6aa	boy!  in arabic country it is boy's name ..  as i think  and in other countries .,. boy too|`|pcCMEeo2aa	My sister's middle name is Ryan. With all of the female Ryans these days I think it is pretty unisex.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Ryan is a boys name . it is also an Irish Last name.  My maiden name is Ryan.|`|PnHcsa47aa	I think Ryan is definitely a boys name.  It's acceptable for a girl, but is predominantly for a boy.  And I think for a girl it should be spelled differently, like Rian or Ryanne or something.  So I think especially where you're spelling it Ryan you should have NO problems at all.  It's definitely all boy.
umGzyElZaa	No... your son is fine! I have a 3 month old that ate 4oz every 3 hours (sometimes wanted it every 2 hours) at 3 weeks...he just started eating 5oz every 3 or 4 hours about 3 weeks ago!  When he wants to eat more frequently, hes going through a growth spurt. Is he sleeping a little more than usual? My little guy does that about once a month...eat a little more, sleep a little more. Then it just kinda levels out for a while.   Quite normal, I wouldn't worry! Hes just a growin boy! :o)|`|q1b7170caa	Dont worry - he will stop when full|`|zHXrvjBHaa	no your baby is not eating to much he will be fine if you get to worried just ask your doc but there is no need to worry|`|vue9NOhYaa	Completely normal.  As long as your giving him only food appropriate to his age (breastmilk or formula) and feeding him what he needs, when he needs it, will will not overeat. If he does take more than  he can hold, he'll spit up the excess and no harm is done    Babies are SUPPOSED to be gaining weight, and 3 weeks is a common time for a growth spurt.     He knows what he needs, so trust him.  (Really, what's the other option?  Letting him cry from hunger?)|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	im assuming he is having a growth spurt, my seven week old son had one at three weeks also.  he was taking the same amount yours is.  now hes taking 4 1/2 ounces every 3-4 hours.  sometimes he will go longer if hes asleep but thats rare lol. a baby will only take what they are hungry for, remember that.  my son was 8 lbs . 6 oz at birth by the way.  its normal.|`|u7zmUivHaa	omg fatty boombatty in da house|`|HvALvdc7aa	My 8 week old still eats evry 2 hours 5oz at a time. Except at night. As long as they aren't spitting it up its fine. Probably just a growth spurt. Congrads on your baby!!!|`|XOtOMncwaa	He's fine. My son was draining 3 ounces in the hospital, and ate every 2 hours. He was up to 4 ounces by the time he was 1 month old, still every 2 hours. A baby wont over eat, they will eat what they need and that's it, so let him eat what he wants and don't worry about it. My son was always a big eater, and to this day if I'm in a restaurant he gets SO excited!|`|bMvAmMTaaa	at 3 wks my daughter was drinking 4ozs every 4hrs, she was 8lbs @ birth. i think you should keep doing wot ur doin.|`|edb8091d08e70995c94b8aaf70084a4eaa	if you take him to the doctor they will tell you, you have to control how much he eats. are he'll start crying and you will not know why from a tummy ache.|`|jgDlkSiWaa	According to kellymom.com  "Common times for growth spurts are during the first few days at home and around 7-10 days, 2-3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months and 9 months (more or less). Babies don't read calendars, however, so your baby may do things differently."  Feed him if he's hungry.|`|v3LhdCMCaa	I'm pretty sure he's fine.  My daughter is going on seven months and she's always ate every two hours or so.  When I brought her home from the hospital I was worried too because she was constantly eating....but her doctor said to feed her whenever she's hungry.  For me not to wait the whole three or four hours.  Good luck and there is no need to worry.|`|qr8yxOBfaa	No they all go thru that phase when all they do is eat and sleep alot.   And they all they do is play and hardly eat.  At his six-week check-up bring it to the doctor's attention and see what they say.  Just make sure you are not one of those mothers on Maury crying about how your son just got big and you don't know how and you can not stop feeding him.  LOl :)|`|jTJNOUMwaa	My son started around 3 or 4 weeks to eat a lot more too. So much more in fact that I had to stop breastfeeding because I couldn't keep up with him!  It is normal and is probably just a growth spurt. If he eats too much either he will spit it back up or he will get a belly ache and then you can cut back again. Most babies won't eat after they're full though so as long as he wants it give it to him, i say! haha|`|P2hhUsoMaa	My son was eating 3 ozs at 2 weeks old.  He was born at 9lbs 4 ozs.  The doctor said thats great!  But he definately has a belly.  I'm not sure why he's so huge since I'm not and neither is daddy.  He's probably having a growth spurt.  Don't stress about it.  Unless he's acting fussy afterwards like he is too full, he's probably fine.  Good Luck!
3xMQW0A6aa	i am almost 8wks and i feel exactly the same way!  if my stomach is empty i feel sick so yea, i eat and eat and eat all day long LOL but i guess thats your body's way of getting you to eat. and i wouldnt worry to much about gaining weight, because i would think its the same whether you eat small all day or sit down and eat 3 large meals. besides, you are feeding a little baby in there and he/she is depending on that food!!!|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I had to snack all day to keep away morning sickness. Keep active and eat little healthy snack between meals, like cheese and apple slices.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	You feel sick when you aren't eatting because your blood sugar drops.  Thats why they say eat crackers before you get out of bed in you have morning sickness.      Don't worry about gaining weight as long as you are eating healthy.  You need to keep that baby healthy.
1hzkIoxcaa	that name sounds so cute i love it   i wish i was named blake its a unisex name but a famous teenage girl  is named blake   i also love the idea of 2 middle names  and they sound good togther       i think that your friend should go threw with this name it is a very cute name and i would love to have it|`|pcCMEeo2aa	I don't think it is crazy at all. Maybe just taking out one of the middle names but even with both I think it is nice.|`|Btlr3Ij7aa	I think Blake Love Williams is adorable for a girl. Angel isn't as cute, especially with Love after it - it's way too much.    I would definitely stick with Blake Love Williams (her nickname can be Love or Lovie, it's so cute)!|`|iTOCf9Mzaa	Take out the love and it is passable, i thought Blake was a boys name but it unisex =/|`|r6TijtS8aa	I like it. It's a little unusual, but it sounds like thats what you are going for. I like how all of the names have meanings and stories behind them. The only thing is that it reminds me alot of gwen stefani's Love Angel Music Baby|`|U1juqahIaa	I don't like it.  Yes, the name is too crazy. Blake is a boy's name and it should stay that way.  Love and Angel both scream "Stripper" or "Porn star", especially when they're put together.  Angel alone is much better if she has to use it. Your friend's daughter is either gonna be mistaken for a boy or people won't take her seriously.  Imagine a 25-30 year old woman trying to get a job in a Doctor's office.  The employer will probably overlook her resume because her name is too "out there".    If she must go with a season/nature name, try Aurora, Wren, Jada, Jesenia, Jewel (a bit of a stretch but better than Love), Keilani (means sea and sky in Hawaiian), Linnea, Sierra, or Zinnia.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	She'll get called Bals from the initials.   Please think about the child and the life she will have if she has a rotten "fancy" name which will already be out of fashion by the time she goes to school.   Give her a simple first name and a more fanciful middle name, and let the child choose when she gets older.  Either that or she'll never forgive you.|`|TN72hvpEaa	Take out the Love and you'll be Great :)|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I LOVE Blake for a girl! It is one of my top girl names.      Angel and Love , however, on not my favorites. They are a little too much for me.    It is her baby though, and as much as you may want her to name it one thing, the ultimate decision is up to her.    Blake Olivia is what I want to name my daighter someday. I also like:    Blake Eliza  Eliza Love  Audrey Angel  .... ok, so I dont like angel and Love in any shape, way, or combo... but those are my suggestions. Congrats to your friends and you(?) !|`|urarletqaa	When I first looked at that name I thought the parents are Robbie Williams fans.|`|6hrpoVUZaa	I like it:)
ZE9U0rDCaa	When i was around 13 and i was irregualar like you i had the most awful cramps.I thought i was going to die one day in school and i couldnt even lie down in the nurses office.I wanted to scream.  You could be ovulating which happens half way to your period.Im 42 and i still get cramps terrible when i ovulate.Yes it will calm down but if it doesnt tell your mom.|`|NZKiSfVOaa	idk, all i know is people are different,some people cramp really bad, some people cramp and some people dont cramp at all.  Some people can be on a period for 3 days and some can be on for 7 days.  I'd say if your having cramps and not had your period (even if you are irregular,)  with in two days of not having a period tell your mom to book an oppointent at the doctors, becuase it might be a stomach bug or something.  I started in may last year, and I'm still abit irregular, it's more irregular when you keep thinking about it, (worried if it comes when your not expecting it ect...) so dont think about it and dont worry about it, just stick a pantie liner in your knickers every day or a always ultra pad if you want to be extra safe.  Cramps usually dont quiet down before you start they normally play up when your on and a day or two before.   I dont have cramps and only on for 3-5 days normally but the more you worry or think about it or if your stressed...  I'm 14 and this site really helped me www.beinggirl.com you can email an agony aunt who will email you back with in a few days (i have emailed her and she helped me alot!) and she will be able to help you further.  good luck x|`|WBXi14WYaa	I had the same thing last Wednesday (unbearable pain and bloating). I started Thursday. I didn't skip a whole block of time though. I started in December. My friend told me to eat a banana and it really helps!   Oh and you will probably start any day now.|`|dcovK6oqaa	go see a gynecologist so he can prescribe you medicine.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	finally someone who isn't sexually active.    what's you're experiencing is normal, but if this is the first time it's happened you should go to the GYN.  let her take a look and decide what to do. most GYNs prescribe birth control pills to regulate a woman's cycle.|`|4KHDjq62aa	Go to planned parenthood.
3WWHWsHOaa	Both parents experience the bonding time of feeding the child.  You know exactly what your childs intake is.  You do not have to watch what you eat and your child's stomach will not be upset if you eat something the baby doesn't agree with.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Knowing exactly how much your baby is drinking.    Convienence - dad can feed the baby too.|`|mXS3ZpPHaa	Youu Cann Doo It Anywherrre And Anytimee!! X xx- Hope I Have Helped Youu!|`|AA11427561	you could have someone else watch the baby while you work or have some time to yourself|`|hT7trB8baa	you can measure your babys intake and monitor their growth, other people can do it in your absence  convenience!|`|AA11004428	there's only pros with bottle feeding. there are cons with breast feeding: inconvenient, dad cant participate, dont know how much baby is getting, the pump, babies feed more frequently because its not as filling as formula.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	what everyone else said ...    ... plus, if breastfeeding is impossible for any reason, it's better than starving.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	You can do all these things breastfeeding your baby too.  I breastfed ever where, I knew exactly how much they were getting by the amount of diapers and the weight gain, my husband got to feed them too.  I always ate what I wanted too.  You can even go out without your baby while leaving them with someone for the night, they call it using a breast pump!!!    You get to wash a lot of bottles, buy bottles & formula, get up at night to fix a bottle.  Sounds like fun to me!!!      dianee:  You are VER WRONG!!!! it may be in inconvenience to you but it was never one for me!  Feeding more means this sets baby up for a life time of healthy eating habits.  It's best to eat more through out the day while eating less at a sitting.
sGRZxLfYaa	When my second son swallowed a penny (what he told us) and pooped out a dime.  My husband thought we may have stumbled on to a great money-making opportunity!!!  (Not to take it too lightly - pennies can get stuck in the esophagus or intestinal tract and cause serious poisoning)|`|Kg5KX432aa	ha ha ha ha   thanks for the laugh :) that was good|`|WzKrZoHQaa	LMAO ...... but about right ;)|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	LOL! The part about the baby clothes...so true!!
ERjGLJaEaa	I was 21 with my first and married, but just like you right at the start of mine and his relationship my mother helped up out alot. I didn't want to tell her, but when I did it was a HUGE weight lifted off my shoulder and we shopped together and she would always be picking up little things here and there for the baby. I am actually really glad I told her and I regretted not telling her until I was 4 months along. The sooner the better. Good luck!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Honey, we are there right now.  I'd have to write you an e-mail "for the details" it would be too long on here.  Right now we are relying on my husband's Grandparents to help us out.      Gosh, they are out of a lot of money because of us.  I feel so bad.  It's like just when we get ourselves to a place where we are fine. . . something comes crashing down around us.  *makes a sad face*    Right now, would be one of those times.  We have NOTHING in our food cupboards and I have been living off of just coffee for the last 3 days.  Atleast I have the feeling of a full stomach.  *sighs*    I know tons of people will give me thumbs down now, but I actually just had another interview for Food Stamps again.  I feel like such a bad person.|`|Yxhbv4x0aa	good thing your not 15 you be screwed lol, your married and supposed to have babies, suck it up whimp!|`|lPgwZzoWaa	Not exactly, but I really dislike my mom and so when I found out I was pregnant right before Christmas she called (I usually don't answer when she calls) and I looked at my hubby and was like,"Oh PLEASE can I ruin her Christmas??"    Sounds like you guys have things in hand!  If she freaks out, tell her all you are doing to prepare for the baby and I am sure she will get excited soon enough!!
8t8NjjnVaa	Personally, I don't really believe colic is a real problem.  Babies cry for a reason, not just because.  If a baby is crying for hours straight, there is something wrong.  People just call it colic when they can't figure anything else out.    It's much more common in bottlefed babies, so that seems to point to a digestive issue.  Trapped air in the stomach or intestines can be painful and can be what causes the crying, but since you can't actually see the trapped air, you really don't know what it is for sure.    The term colic refers to excessive crying that lasts for hours a day, for no reason that can be found (doesn't mean there isn't a reason, it just means they can't find one).  Babies are naturally fussy, and many parents say they are colicky when in fact they are just a normal baby.    There is no known "cause", and no known cure.  But again, it could be something as simple as gas, and switching formulas or breastfeeding could solve the problem.    There are many hypothesis out there, one is that there is a problem in the intestines.  The natural bacteria there can be off balance, causing intestinal issues and pain.  Formula, even just one bottle can change the gut flora (normal intestinal bacteria).  So if you are worried about it, you should definitely breastfeed.  (You should breastfeed anyway because it's healthier for the child in a lot of ways).    There really hasn't been any studies that show a genetic link, and even if there was, I wouldn't worry about it if I were you because you were likely fed that cereal before your system was able to handle it, and you were formula fed.  Your "colic" was likely intestinal pain due to being fed something you couldn't properly digest.|`|6JEfhjscaa	Colic, for an infant is having pain in the abdomen, and that comes from  having  alot of gas an its even harder for babies because the are so small, there are special products babies can use to control that, that will help, or the other option you have is talk to your doctor my daughter had the same problems I took her to her doctor and he proscribed a medicine that worked for her.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Colic is a diagnosis of exclusion.  It's excessive crying in a young baby that cannot be explained by medical causes like gas, allergies, reflux, etc.   Because nobody really knows what is it, there no known cure (the person who comes up with a cure will be millionaire) and, so far as I'm aware, it's not genetic.    Back in the day babies were often described as 'colicky' when the problem WAS gas or allergies ... which is what it sounds like was  happening with you.  You were given solids too early, and possibly a formula that you were allergic to, resulting in a constant belly ache.|`|DDFSITiYaa	Colic, as related to animals, more specifically horses, is an digestive problem where the gasses from certain foods build up in the stomach making digestion painful and difficult.  The gasses distend the stomach causing a severe bloat that is or can be fatal ( to a horse).     Colic in babies is a matter of much dispute.  Some people apply the horse theory and feel it is gas in the stomach and intestines as a result of feeding and it is painful, therefore making a baby cry long and hard.    However, there is no medical diagnoses for this and for most of the medical profession, colic is term used when there is no medical reason for a baby's prolonged crying spells.  There is no cause, no cure.  Many believe that babies simply need time to adjust to life outside the womb and therefore you may hear the term 4th trimester to describe this phase.     It is true that many infants have long drawn out crying periods that nothing seems to resolve or comfort them, other than time and patience.
uxItOSkmaa	Just let her go at her own pace.  Give her a spoon with her oatmeal (to play/practice) and feed it to her with another spoon too.  For not messy meals, offer the the spoon/fork, so her each time what to do & then let her go to town.  My son began eating with a spoon around 1 year  He's 24 months old now and eats with a spoon/fork very well, but still chooses to eat with his hands often.  No biggie.  Table manners in a toddler are nothing to stress about, IMO.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Daughter started at 9 months and is using forks and spoon at 22 months. Shes pretty good, my husband is Indian and they eat the majority of there food with there hands, so this drives him batty. he hates that she is using utensils, and get mad at me when I give her one. I dont mind she just did it her self I didnt encourage it, it came with the bowls and plates I bought her. I think its not a big deal yet till they are at least 2 or 3.|`|H8MGismEaa	One was ten months old. One 11months and 12months. They are all different and go at their own pace. Regardless of when they learn the spoon, they will go back to making everything "finger food" for the next year anyway. It makes for some great picture moments. They are adults now and those pictures still bring a grin from ear to ear.   By the way, they won't get frustrated if they don't sense pressure to please the grownups.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	my daughter is almost 14 months and cant even do it at all. she prefers her fingers. sorry i dont have many tips, we just keep trying|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Our kids were starting to use them by themselves by their first birthdays.  But that was interesting!  We would just have an extra spoon and feed them in between their efforts so that they still were eating.  They liked the idea of doing it together.  We stopped doing that by the time they were about 15 months old, as they had gotten "okay" at it.  My son is going to be 3 in April and he does really well with it.  My daughter will be 2 in May and she does pretty good with it now, with limited mess.  Just keep letting her do it and she will eventually get the hang of it!  I would try either feeding her in between so that way she feels like she is still eating, because some of the frustration may be from her still being hungry and not getting any food., or you could try holding her spoon with her to help her get stuff on it, and guide it partway to  her mouth.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I honestly do not remember, but at 22 months, my daughter uses a spoon & fork with ease, but I remember exactly what you are going through. My trick was to just offfer it at each and every meal. I would say here is your big girl spoon, and leave it at that. When she was ready she showed interest and used it. Don't make it a big deal or something they need to do and there will be no frustration.|`|wmXb8A8maa	my daughter was 15 months old when she perfected it... before then i always wanted to feed her so she wouldnt get dirty because she hated wearing bibs..LOL..but then she said to me " self " as in feed herself and she does a great job...|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	Children should be given a spoon to play with when they can grasp it, around 6 months old.  They won't get the point of it right away, but will play with it and will become a familiar object at meal time.  It will take a few more months before they begin dabbing at the food on their plate and putting it to their mouth.    My fiance's daughter has a hard time still with using utensils to eat.  The day care is content to let her use her hands.  Her mom (at her other home) still feeds her and there are times when she won't eat much because I refuse to hand feed her.    Be content to let them eat however they want at this age.|`|UmX58lC0aa	over 9000
MxhNzW7Oaa	I loved my induction. Way better than going into labor naturally.     Tyler was born at 38w4d via induction. He was smaller (5 lbs 11 oz) but he's still a small kid. Have they guestimated a weight for your baby yet? He had no medical problems what-so-ever. I think if you are ready, then go ahead with the induction. Like your doctor said, you're body will more than likely comply with the induction. The women that end up in a c-section are women whose bodies weren't ready for labor yet. Yours sounds like it is.    Plus, don't you want a Valentine this year? He'll be your little Valentine :)|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Pregnancy and dates can be a tricky thing.  In reality, 38 weeks is full term.  There would be almost no chance of a medical problem that would be caused by delivery then.  Besides that, the actual date of conception is rarely known 100%, so really, you could be closer to that 40 weeks than you think.....    I say go for it....meet your baby!|`|TQW5E6olaa	I say shoot for V-DAY. 38 weeks is fine!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I think you are going to go before Wednesday.  And if you don't... I'd wait a little while longer.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	They are inducing me at 39 weeks because of swelling (my bones are sliding in and out of place now, I hope yours doesn't get this bad!). Have they told you about how big he is now?     You may not make it until then though! Unfortunately you could also be there for awhile, I was at a 3 and 80% for a couple weeks... just hit a 4 and 90% yesterday.     Being 38 weeks now... I'd be all for an induction tomorrow =) but I have little patience. Wait till you next appointment, see how you feel and if you notice the swelling is worse or you are having more problems I would say schedule the induction, but if you are still feeling pretty good for being so far along you might consider waiting at least a week or so.|`|vKYdV5r2aa	MONDAY !  MONDAY  !  MONDAY ?|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well I don't think you'll last until wednesday to be honest! But I would go ahead and induce if you don't. 38 weeks is technically full term, and not premature, so your baby shouldn't have any health problems from being a little early. So just pack your bag, get everything for the baby ready, and SLEEP... your baby will be here before you know it! Congrats, it's very exciting!|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	I, personally, would go when the doctor says, especially if there are other problems to factor in. However, keep in mind that when you get induced it raises your chances of having a c-section. But as far along as you are, I wouldn't think you'd have a problem delivering. I ended up getting induced and having a c-section, but I wasn't at all dialated ahead of time. Good luck!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Don't stress about it yet and see what happens in the next wk. Alot could change. I am really against inductions, because I had one that was terrible. Having said that, if you were already dialated to 4 when you began, it would be a whole different scenario. Go for lots of walks, and see what happens. 38 weeks if full term, so do not worry about that part. Good Luck!|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I would wait it out. I think you are going to go sooner then the 14th. Just keep rubbing your tummy and talking to your little man.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	if you dont go on your own...go for it!!...why wait it out any longer?....she wouldnt want to induce if she didnt feel that it was safe........goodluck....|`|prqrQcd1aa	My last 2 children were born at 38 weeks..which is suppose to be a "term" delivery. They both looked as if they were born a little too early ( hair still on the body, genitalia was not like it would have been at 40 weeks, etc.) They were FINE, other than that, they matured fine even after they were born. Their lungs were the most important thing, and at that time they are mature. I was not that fully dilated with the last two either, and had to have c-sections... so my circumstances are not the same as yours.  I think if you are that far along and are already going through labor symptoms that everything will be fine, there should be no look of being premature. I would just do it then and enjoy that new baby!...  That is IF you don't go before that lol! Either way good luck!|`|aJjV5b95aa	I really don't think that you will make it without having next Wednesday. If you do I would go with what the doctor says she knows what is best.|`|01vMpHkWaa	well this is when you look at yourself  how are you feeling?  are you ready?  if your even somewhat ready(once you have that baby, people are going to want to help you so if your not ready, you will be by the time you take him home lol) and your feeling pretty crappy i say go head with the induction..even though i think you wont even make to then.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	I would go for it.  My daughter was due on Christmas and we already had a 5 year old so I really didn't want to take a chance on being away from her on Christmas morning so when I started dilating and cervix was thinning my doctor gave me the choice to induce.  My daughter was born December 11 at 38 weeks and she was a perfectly healthy baby and I was home and recovered in time to play santa for the oldest!    38 weeks is considered full term and your doctor would not suggest it if did not feel it was safe for you and the baby.
VwMkiLFPaa	Maybe your mother trusts you more than she does your brother. Youre 21 and hes 17.not that maturity is defined by age, but it helps.     I personally never understood that comment really. I am a mother to a boy. I have a stepdaughter. I dont tiptoe around my stepdaughter because shes a girl. And I dont go hard on my son just because hes a boy.     As a parent, its your job to parent your children.  You are responsible for your son just as you are responsible for a daughter. When my son falls, as long as there are no immediate tears, I dont run to him to see if hes okay because he needs to learn. With my stepdaughter, I do the same. Im not harder on one than the other, I actually try REALLY hard to be as equal as I can.     I dont know, maybe Im just in the minority here but I never saw it as an issue. It is if you make it out to be, but I never saw it that way.    ** ADD **  Okay, but that's so hypocritical really. Because who is out there doing the rapes, someone's son? So if maybe that mother was as hard on her son as she is on her daughter, maybe that particular man wouldn't have issues?    I don't know, I guess I just don't see it.    ** ADD **    And another thing, when your daughter comes home pregnant or when she's sneaking out because she's forbidden, what gender got her pregnant? LOL. A BOY. So clearly, we should be hard on both of our kids. Because last time I checked, it takes two to make a baby. And with all the single parents out there, it just amkes me think maybe we're being strict on the wrong end. Or maybe we need to be strict with BOTH kids.     Just my take...|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I know parents that have both boys and girls. Sadly there seems to be a huge double standard there. It's rare to find a parent that will allow their daughter the same freedoms as their son. Something about girls being more fragile and needing to be protected I suspect. Anyway, it drives me nuts.|`|QikvnTnqaa	Maybe it's because you could easily leave and he can't so she trusts him more? Maybe there's a reason she doesn't trust you?     And only you would know if you would let your son "get away" with things, that's a parental choice. Not for us.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	I think different things are expected of boys and girls just because boys naturally have more upper body strength which, yes, the upper body is used more than the lower body when it comes to fighting and such, so yeah, if he meets with trouble your mom thinks he's going to fare better... nonetheless, I think she should worry about the two of you equally.   My mom told me she didn't want me to date until I was in college, but my little brother got his first "girlfriend" when he was like 8. It's not right...morally, to raise them differently, but realistically I think society is going to expect different things from men and women and not everyone is going to treat them equally so it's important to atleast prepare them for that.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Do you have it all together? What I mean is...Does your future look brighter than your brothers? Is he kind of a slacker? It is possible they expect more from you.     I can't think of any other reason they would be so chauvinistic.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I agree with Jade.You could leave when ever you want at 17 he has no choice.But that is not good parenting she should question him as well.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	I grew up with 2 sister and 2 brothers.  My sisters and I had a curfew of 12 my brothers didn't, my sisters and I had to do laundry and dishes my brothers didn't.  My dad always said boys couldn't get pregnant and they would have a wife to take care of the house so yeah my parents did.    Now I have a son and daughters and it is the same for all 3.  They all do laundry, wash dishes, clean the bath etc.  My husband has taught our oldest that is 16 ow to change the oil in her car, change a tire etc just as our son knows.    Many do make a difference though.  They see girls as needed protection and boys as being tough.  What they don't see is if the boys were a little more respectful and really appreciated all the girls did then the girls wouldn't need protected from them!|`|QTiTDz4yaa	It is a safety precaution.  It's not about "letting them get away with things".  There is much less chance of a rapist grabbing your 17 year old brother and having his way than there is with you.  Maybe your mom is just looking out for you.
HSe6n5Tlaa	My son fully potty trained at 21 months old and my daughter fully potty trained at 19 months old.  My son trained first on pooping, about a month before he got the hang of peeing in the toilet.  My daughter got the hang of peeing on the toilet about a month before she would poop on it.  So, time-wise, it took about the same (but my daughter did it earlier), but it was easier in one way to potty train my son.  I could handle him peeing his pants, but I couldn't bare to watch my daughter refuse to poop.  The thing was, she wouldn't poop in her underwear either.  Or in a diaper anymore after she started peeing on the toilet.  But she was so afraid to poop in it, that she would hold it for 4-5 days! And be in pain that whole time, and then finally go on the bathroom floor, after crying and screaming to get off the toilet.  That broke my heart and made it "harder" in one sense to train her.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Not necessarily. I have two boys, and both were a breeze to potty train.|`|dXMdt3gVaa	I think its easier to potty train girls because girls get to spend a lot of time with their moms and often go to the bathroom with them. Little boys on the other hand very rarely go to the bathroom with their dads. Pretty much theyre monkey see monkey do.     But each child is different and you may have a very easy to train baby! So good luck to you.    Just use a lot of positive reinforcement and when they have an accident just pretend its no big deal at all (even though it may make your life harder and may make you go oh man no again!), and before you know it, they can make it to the bathroom on time!|`|HtpRBMFraa	For some reason yes girls are easier.

ni0ayElBaa	I had mine done twice while pregnant with my son, I was over  1 week late by this point. They both made me crampy and bleed a little bit but did not put me into labour unfortunelty. I had to be induced when I was 13 days late.  I do know a few people it has worked for though, my sister had it done and 2 hours later started labor, so I think it is different for everyone.  I hope it works for you, best of luck!|`|BwItIvHqaa	Im 38 and 3 days, and had mine done tuesday, it really hurt, and was uncomfortable, and had bloody show the next day, Still waiting to go into labor on my own. I have a app with my ob on 2morow, and see what they say. Good luck to you.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	I asked to have it done with my first pregnancy and the doctor was going to do so if I was dilated by my next appointment. Unfortunately I wasn't dilated at all, so it never happened. They ended up inducing two days before my due date due to severe swelling.|`|ROJans2Taa	I didnt ask, but my obgyn offered and I accepted, I was 39 weeks, it sent me right into labor, I delivered 17 hrs after it was done, my son was 8lbs 7 ounces.  Best luck to you.|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	Not that this will answer your question but I'm due on valentines day too. I was also wondering if you can ask for the sweep. Last week my cervix was shut as tight as can be but baby was in ready position. Eh. BUT to make you feel a little better 7 lbs 12 oz is not that large of a baby compared to what it could be. When my friend was having her baby in the waiting room this lady was telling me her friend held the record at the hospital for the largest vaginal birth there. The baby was 12 lbs 6 oz. And she didn't tear because they applied the oil correctly that reduces rips. =]  I would ask, well I'm going to, but I think she would do it. Besides if you're getting induced anyways then why not give it a more 'natural' go and see if you can't spark the labor by yourself. Get the sweep then try natural induction things. Walking, sex, red raspberry tea leaf, evening primrose oil both orally and vaginally, cumin seed tea, the pregnancy salad, an entire fresh pineapple. There's about a million things you can try. =p    Best of luck, hope the baby isn't as big as they think!|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I had this done 3 times. Once at 39w2d and again at 40w2d and again at 41w1d and the last time a was already in labor it just made my contractions stronger. The first two times didn't work for me. I guess it has more success after 40 weeks. I was 2cm dilated and 80% effaced every time she did it.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I had it done twice with my son, it didn't work the first time but the second time it did and I had my son almost exactly 24 hours later. Labor started about 12 hours after.    Its worth a shot! It does hurt though..
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I would just try to relax. There isnt much to prevent them. Most miscarriages are from the fetus or embryo being deformed or missing crutial DNA sequences. Your body senses this is not correct and it flushes the baby before it comes to term. I have had 2 miscarriages one at 8 weeks and one at 16 weeks in 1 year, 2000. I had a stillborn son at 5 1/2 months gestation in 2002. We had extensive testing done, to find out its not me. It was my ex-husbands sperm. Over 70% were deformed and bad due to medication for a heart condition as a kid. He also had poor circulation and only about 50% of his ejaculation actually had sperm in it. That was found to be from a Bike accident that hurt his groin and had a permenant kink in the penis. We were going to try invitro and other things but the doc advised against it since my body rejected any sperm from my husband. We were together 8 years and due to other things we divorced. I met my current husband, and while we were dating I got pregnant, I couldnt believe it either. It was a miracle but I was totally gun shy and scared to death I didnt want another miscarriage. I worried through the WHOLE pregnancy. Though it went so well and healthy and not a problem. I gave birth in 2007 to a beautiful baby girl. Smart healthy happy.... and I am 33 weeks pregnant with my second daughter... some problems but no issues. I have not had another miscarriage, and plan a 3 and 4 in the years to come.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You should take a prenatal vitamin that contains folic acid, but I wouldn't take another folic acid pill because you don't want to have too much.  Make sure you are eating right.   I am sorry about your loss.  Many times they are unable to find a reason for a miscarriage.  The majority of the time there is nothing you could have done to prevent it.  Do they know what the reason was for your miscarriages?  If they do know, then maybe they will be able to tell you how to prevent another one.|`|PA5iBQZAaa	my advice is relax and and leave it in Gods hands i have a 12 1/2 year old and  a 6 year old tomorrow :) anyways before the 2nd i had 3 misscariages it was due to low progesterone after the 2nd i reacted very emotionally hurt and angry towards God but i didnt know it at the time when i finally realized that i asked for forgiveness and came to terms that maybe i was just suppossed to have 1 even though my heart desired more but i decided to be thank ful because i had a good life God always provided for me so after the talk with God i relaxed about the whole thing and bam i got pregnant with my 2nd son i know that its so hard to be patient and hard to just alow it to happen when it will but thats what you need to do just give it to God and just have fun trying sometimes we put our bodies through so much stress because we know whats right for us but we are wrong only God knows whats good for us and when hes gonna bless us i think your doing a great job with the vitamins and such you should also have a blood test to show where your hormones are at before you try so you can see what the cause was good luck and God Bless and always believe in miracles beacause they do happen everyday and yours will come God Bless you.|`|AA12014379	Im using my brothers yahoo since mine is gone funny lol  My sister was having problems too( she also had a misscarriage) she went to her doctor to find out when she was ovulating andand she tried she got pregnant, altho i think its like the first 12 weeks they keep a close eye on you to make sure you reach the safe zone of not losing the baby, as they did with her.  you should deffinatly do the same most doctors suggest not to take any suppliments before you try, so try sticking to a healthy diet its self like fruit, veg  good meat etc  i wish you the best hun!! xxx
zZn75IlPaa	Nuby makes a transitional sippy cup to help babies go from bottles to cups.  They are inexpensive and worked well with my grand daughter.  She took to them right away.  The spouts are a softer silicone so they feel like a nipple. She chews on the spouts too but when she does, I just gently divert her attention and take the cup away from her.      I think the key is to take her milk and put it in the sippy cup and try to get some of the liquid into her mouth so she can see that there is something to drink in it.  Just put a little bit of milk in it and let it sit around on a table where she can get to it if she wants it but don't let it sit too long because it needs to be refrigerated.  She will learn that her milk is in there eventually.  Then you can try the juice.  The milk is more important than the juice right now so I would focus on using the sippy cup for the milk.  Perhaps use a different sippy cup for the juice (like a two handled one).  See which one she likes better and put both the milk and juice in the same one that she likes, alternating throughout the day.  It's worth a try.    The Nuby cups are no spill and no drip cups too.  If she has trouble holding them you can get the two handled cups from Nuby too.  You can find them on ebay and the website below.    Also, most babies do play with their food.  They really do learn that way.  I would let her just keep playing with a few at a time.  Try some whole grain cheerios if your doctors says ok or even the fruit snacks they make for babies.  Those are so much softer than the fruit snacks made for older kids.  They almost melt in your mouth.  Gerber makes those as well.   After she finds something she likes, she'll start putting it in her mouth.  Maybe she is just turned off by the texture of the banana puff.  Try other foods with different textures and see what works.  Hope this helps you a bit.|`|ruGhNDmUaa	Try water in the sippy cup, and I also took out the internal drip thing.  That way for a couple of days it kind of just dripped in her mouth, with out having to suck.   She will get the hang of it if you just leave them around that she can grab.    Finger foods, try banana and fresh ripe fruit.  And it is very messy at first,.  Put it on her highchair tray, and eat a couple pieces yourself.  They will figure it out.|`|58a1dfc0dc5b252c83aa446e785f7547aa	what i have done was  i slowing take her off the bottle to sippy cup  then i said no bottle you are big girl you can use sippy cup.   Buy small one first then slowing get bigger one. So she can get start practice using one then by 13 month should be able to know how use sippy cup  i have not give my daughter juice yet and she eat regular fruits at home. So try slowly switch the bottle to sippy cup. Practice make perfect   As For finger food is snacks  put little on the table. or you can start off with cherrios cereal the regular kind.  buy the small puff one too..  Put on the  on the high chair or your hand and have her pick from your hand.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	What kind of sippys are you using? They make sippys that have soft bottle like tops. I believe its nub or nuby that makes them. Thats what i would try if you haven't already.|`|AA10186411	My daughter isn't a big fan of juice in a cup either.  She would drink it in a bottle, but not a cup.  She loves water though.  The only way I could get her to not chew it and make her drink it was to get rid of all the bottles.  After about a week she was drinking it like a pro.  You can use water or formula.  Just make sure she gets enough formula in the day.  I like to give my daughter water at meals and give her a sippy of milk at her snack time.  As for finger foods, just sit them in front of her, preferably when you are eating too.  She will eventually get the idea!|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	I don't know who told you that your daughter has to be off a bottle by age 1, that's just dumb. My daughter didn't call it quits with a bottle until she was 14 months old. She started drinking juice and water outta sippy cups first and then one morning, I gave her milk in a sippy cup and she's been good since.   Don't rush it! You'll know when she's ready. Start with water if she doesn't like juice. Give her a sippy cup 1/2 filled with water ever afternoon and see if she'll take it. If not, just gradually try to give it to her...just don't try and break her of it.|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	When I transitioned my daughter from bottle to sippy cup, I used a sippy cup with handles at first.  This made the idea more familiar to her and gave her greater control over the cup.  They have them everywhere from WalMart on up.    Here is one for $3.85 a piece:    http://www.goodforthekids.com/item.php?i...|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	she may not be ready for a sippy cup yet.  i didn't start my son on a sippy cup until he was drinking whole milk instead of formula.  the way i did it was i gave him a bottle at night and sippy cup during the day. try watering down the juice a bit or give her water, just to get her used to the cup. then when he was 18 mos old i quit giving him a bottle at night. (i know that's a little old, but whatever)   maybe she doesn't like that flavor of the puffs. try the strawberry ones. or try those crunchy ones that are like cheddar or ranch flavored. my son loves those.|`|FMpHtZnBaa	mine wouldnt either we waited until they were ready. someone told use to try the straw cups and see if they would use them better. Mine didnt take finger foods util they were almost 12 months so just give her time and try dipping it in yogurt or babyfood them trying it. it may take a while be patient it will happen.
CXDuaWjFaa	I like it. And ironically, unlike Paris, Brooklyn, etc., Sydney doesn't make me think of Australia for some reason.

I love it.|`|JNkurzBWaa	first and foremost you have to pick a name that you like.....its nothing to do what other people think...i think as long as its not a name which can entice bullying (i used to know a guy called russell sprout)...then you gotta go with the name you like. I think best way to think is could you imagine calling a baby girl that.....what would the abbreviations be eg) sid.....which is more of a boys name.....and do you think the name would suit all ages after all babies grow up......take all the things into consideration and go with what you feel....any name people will wither love or hate...so its your call!

I think its cuter...|`|wkK5JDz4aa	Sounds like a normal name.|`|t5KoPRVbaa	Beautiful name, it's a good idea to find out meaning's and how they fit together, just keep in mind that when she turns 5 she's going to start school and have to know how to spell her name and if it's to long it tends to get difficult, my 4 yr old has a very long name and is finding it a little frustrating learning to write it but we'll get there!|`|NJU2XWu8aa	is dom, is good|`|Ho4xK8DDaa	I don't like the name Dominica, but, I like the meaning.  I do like Jenae and I think Dominica Janae flows well together.
hTQg5tgPaa	Go to the courts get sole custody of the child with a restraining order pronto.  If he abused you, chances are he is going to abuse the child too.  If he wants to see the child, it should be supervised (by a third party of your choosing, can be an organization i.e. child and parent place).  You can go to the courts and get a ruling right away with an ex-parte/emergency motion (that is what they are called up here in Canada, I would assume that they have a similar thing down in the States).  Prior to going to the courts, if he has abused you, I would report him to the police and take the report with you to the courts.  If you don't report him, then he will probably do it to someone else down the line.  Plus you have a better chance of getting the order taken out right away (that is that day).|`|oojO4WAraa	Call the police and get a PFA or restraining order - TODAY.

dXMdt3gVaa	Lol yes babies make little piggy noises especially when they find their food yummy!     The worst noises for me was my oldest daughter in the backseat of the car on the way back from daycare, where I would have sippy cup ready for her (the one with the valve) and she would just suck and suck and suck and glug and glug and glug that damn sippy cup till it was finished and I swore I swore I had a rabid beast in the car, and not a pretty little girl glugging down that cup!

Occasionally hollering out of joy or frustration with food in his mouth.  Laughing. Blowing raspberries with food in his mouth (gross!)  Yes, they are little piggies but I think it's hilarious.
yrDqtazLaa	They'll first admit you into the hospital, get you dressed into the gown and hooked up to the monitors. Then, they'll give you an IV, where they'll hook you up with some Pitocin (what starts the contractions). The pitocin will help make contractions and help you dilate and soften your cervix. You may also walk around with the IV to help progress your labor. They will offer you an epidural when you get to about 4-5cm dilation. The contractions are strong, I won't lie. The epidural helped a lot. Even with the pitocin, I was progressing slowly, but after I had the epidural, the labor went much quicker. If you don't progress after a certain amount of time, or the baby goes into distress, they'll probably prep you for a c-section.    By the way, you'll probably want to leave your daughter with family, you don't want a 4 year old running around while you're in labor, trust me. Maybe your family can bring her to visit while you're in there, but I would definitely suggest asking your family to keep her with them until you come out of the hospital, you need your rest and recovery time.    Edit: Graham's mama is right, I totally forgot about that tablet they can insert to start labor. The most common way is pitocin, though.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I'm going in on Tuesday morning to be induced. They'll put you on a drip, everyone I've talked to including my doctor said that your contractions aren't really bad until they break your water. I was also told that they will give you internal monitors to measure your contractions so the doctors can regulate them.    I wish I could tell you from personal experience but you get to go before me!! I hope everything goes well and you have a fast, uncomplicated labor.    As for the 4 year old, I think it would be nice but only if you had some one there to keep an eye on her... she'll probably get bored.|`|7C9Ett7Caa	As for your 4 yr old, I would definatlely leave her with family until u leave the hospital.. She would be a big distraction and she may annoy u during labor.   First, when you get to hospital, they will give u a pitocen drip to start contractions. Most women find that the pitocin drip causes worst than normal condtractions, so be prepared for lots o pain. They will probably insert some kind of medication into your vagina to soften your cervix. Whenever a women gets induced, it may take a long time to progress.. Way longer than normal. Your chances of a c-section goes up, if being induced. You've already had one child, so that could be a plus. Congrats!! Im 37 weeks and I wish I was delivering on saturday, ur sooo lucky!! LOL|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Not a mom - but have been through 4 deliveries.    You are injected with Pitocin (Oxytocin) which is the same hormone your body normally makes to initiate the birthing process. Other than the IV, you don't feel much of anything until the contractions start.|`|iwtetdBoaa	awwwwww god bless :)  im being induced monday morning !  whohohohohoh  with my 2nd son i was induced and everything went great!  dont worrie about it just enjoy the new life about to come :)  good thing about being induced is you will get ur meds before any labor & pain starts       i like being induced myself better!  ill be going in  , while you on ur way home, take care i cant wait!!!!!|`|MeYILJeSaa	As far as hurting worse, I wouldn't know, because I've only been through it once.  But it did take a long time to really start working and "kick in". I wasn't induced by Pitocin, though like a lot of hospitals use. They used this tablet thing that they put up there against the cervix and it starts contractions and gradually sends you into labor. I went in at 8am on 11/14, and they continued to put a tablet in every 4 hours. It took 4 times to get me going, the doctor actually said that if the 4th time didn't work he was going to send me home. But my water finally broke at 3:30am on 11/15 and I had him at 1:12pm. They also gave me a little Pitocin after my water broke to keep me going-they were afraid I was going to stop-he really wasn't ready to come out yet!  I was also induced at 37 weeks because of pre-eclampsia, so since you're further along, your babe may be more willing to meet you! Good luck and congrats!  Edit: Everyone is telling you that they give you Pitocin, which isn't always the case. I wish I could remember what the tablet things are called-they bring on a more gradual and gentle labor, while Pitocin starts you hard and fast.|`|ni0ayElBaa	Well  I only have 1 child and I was induced.  I got admitted into the hospital at 11 am, and at 12 noon they broke my water. I waited for a while and around 1:00 I was given pictocin through my IV and my contractions started around 3:00 or so.  I got the epidural at 5 pm and delivered at 1:26 am.  Honestly, I was not in pain for long before they gave me an epidural. They can give you the epidural faster when you are induced.  I enjoyed the whole experience, I had a great team of doctors and nurses and they made me as comfortable as possible.  I wish you luck!
v3LnJycKaa	TELL HIM... he will change when the baby is her, my hubby is a motorcross rider, loves his outdoors etc... all he ever wanted was boys and everyone when so far as to say ____ only make boys, well it looks like we are on  3, all girls... I will tell you it took him a little bit but to watch him with his daughter he treasures them, they are his world he can not even see our youngest cry, one gets hurt and he is ready to rush to the hospital.. I mean it, my 5 year old got a bloody nose last year and he wanted to go to the emergency room... she is also the same one who crashed her dirt bike and broke her eye socket and needed stitches, my little toughy went to the er, they couldnt give her novicane because it was too close to her eye, he held her while she got her stitches and he bawled his eyes out, while she sat there without a tear... it was amazing, daddys always want little boys, they want carbon copies of themselves but the love between a father and daughter is AMAZING to say the least, wait until she says DADA first, or gets excited when he comes home... I wouldnt worry love, let him have his moments of mourning for the son he didnt get, because after she is here he will be so busy loving her he wont have time to Mourn...     ever think that maybe he is just realizing how close he is to being a dad period.. that can be very overwhelming, the reality that it is here now?|`|28fNd725aa	First just cry... you know you want to and being preggers Im suprised you've held it in this long.  Now don't worry.... the second he see's your beautiful baby and the first time she looks up into his eyes he will melt!!  I promise it will be beautiful!!  And if it would help let him buy his little girl a sports jersery... girls can were those too!!|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	I was very disappointed too when I found out my wife and I were having alittle girl... I fortunately though realized how blessed I am that she is completely healthy so far, (30 weeks) and get so excited when I feel her punch or kick... Every father wants a little boy to play catch with, buy cool video games, play football... things like that... with a girl... everything pretty much revolves around "is it pink?"... It's not a disappointment for the baby, I'm sure it's just disappointment in general... when he sees his little girl for the first time, i bet his tune changes instantly... Good luck!!|`|yrDqtazLaa	I think the man has cold feet. Of course, there's something in there that men have that make them want boys (to carry on the family name, I suppose). That said, once he sees that little girl, he'll get the biggest twinkle in his eyes. She'll be daddy's little princess. Not to worry, he won't be able to say "I don't care" when she comes. Those feelings will pass.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I'm sorry. And I wouldn't worry too much. Once he meets his little girl he won't be able to help completely falling in love with her. I think that most men really want a baby boy, I know the first time I was pregnant I really wanted a girl because I didn't know what to do with a boy. Well, it was a boy and I couldn't have loved him more and then couldn't even imagine what I would do with a girl. He may just fell the same way, that he doesn't know much about girls. This will be my second girl and let me tell you that my little girl has a way of always stealing her daddy's heart. He adores her even though he is such a man's man.  Don't worry, he will love her to death. Oh, and some men just really don't care about baby stuff. I know that my fiance could care less what the baby gets or what I buy her it doesn't mean that he will love her any less. He's just not interested in the kind of stuff, I think it's more of a women thing, that's why a lot of times baby showers are just women, because men are just not into that kind of thing.|`|buoqtZeFaa	Don't worry yourself I am sure once he see's and holds that baby for the first time he will fall in love with her.  You can talk to him about how you feel and see what he has to say. (don't excuse him of being upset just tell him lately you have been feeling this way).    Good Luck and condragulations on your little girl!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Most dad's want a boy.  My husband did too.  And we had a girl.  And what's worse is she always wanted me over him.  But he loved her sooo much when she was born.  And he thought we'd only ever have girls.  We got pregnant again and it was a boy.  I was concerned he'd love him more.  He doesn't.  He loves his son so much and his daughter so much.  Don't worry.  Your daughter's father will love her to the moon and back.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	all men want their little boy.  ...i am sorry for what you are going through  but once he sees that little girl he'll be wrapped around her little finger|`|QTiTDz4yaa	He will get over it and MOST LIKELY this little girl will have him wrapped around her little finger.  Trust me on that.|`|MO2H26XOaa	My fiance was the same way. I wanted the girl, and he wanted the boy. At our ultrasound he made a sad face too. After awhile he came around. Once he sees your beautiful little creation, and could care less if its a girl or boy as long as shes healthy. It may be him having cold feet. He doesn't want to show that he is nervous, so he is expressing his feelings through him not having a boy. Cheer up. Things can only get better! Good Luck!|`|WSbfkuSZaa	Wow.... I'm sorry for you! I completely understand your frustration. My fiance already has a little girl and he loves her to death. He always wanted a daddy's girl though. We are having our first child in June and on Monday we find out the sex. I'm wanting a little girl, but I know he is wanting a boy. He swears that he will be happy no matter what and wouldn't mind having two daughters, but I'm afraid he will do the same thing. I think that when he sees your daughter though, he will fall in love with her. My dad never wanted me or my sister until he held us. In fact I was visiting with him the other night and he flat out told me how he was angry when my mom got pregnant, but as soon as he held us in his arms he loved us. Hopefully your husband will be the same. Don't let him ruin your joy though. Best Wishes!|`|vjsT8DMIaa	First of all, Im very sorry that he's acting like that!! Way to make you feel good, ya know!!?? Maybe he's just becoming more and more nervous as the big day approaches, where he'll all of a sudden go from no responsibilities, to all of a sudden being responsible for another human life. It can be quite intimidating...however, he should really watch what he says and how he acts...especially because you are carrying the life that you two made together!! I swear if my husband acted like that towards me, I'd plainly let him know that its his fault...LOL...its his swimmers that determine the sex.   I know every man wants a little boy....you know, its the carrying on of their family name, however, little girls are just as special...they are daddys little girls!!  I think that after he sees your little girl, he will  quickly change his mind!! Good luck to you and congrats!!!|`|8uqbNrICaa	All guys want a son. It is in our make-up. This is one reason I would tell anyone pregnant to be surprised about the baby's sex.    Once I held my daughter for the first time seconds after she was born it no longer mattered! She was my life.|`|PC0ukWJHaa	Tell him that he is going have to deal with it and be a good father. If he agrees with it then he's a good man and keep him. If he doesn't then let him go.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Sounds like he is starting to get scared and also that reality is setting in that the baby is coming soon.  I bet once your girl is born it will change everything.  It is hard for dad's to not be wrapped around their daughters finger.  I would let him have his little tantrum and watch how quickly it all changes once he sees her.|`|dtvk24CEaa	He might be sad that he doesn't have a little boy...but you know when he first lays eyes on his own little girl, he is going to be amazed at how much he loves her. I think he is just getting cold feet over the fact of being a dad, but im sure he will treasure this baby ..dont worry  i'll be praying for you!!!|`|LTNBeJN1aa	maybe he is just super nervous and just then realized this is real dont worry when he i don't think its the fact that its a girl he has cold feet but he will probably snap out of it when he sees her beautiful face.|`|yshWjf11aa	My hubby did a lot with our first (a boy) but our daughter is exactly like him in temperament.  He had a hard time bonding with her, but now that he is older she has him wrapped around her little finger. Although he complains, he would do anything for her.  She (20 years old) just went through getting her tonsils out this week, what with waiting at the hospital and caring for her, we had a bad scare yesterday, she had to go to ER couldn't swallow, and last night she passed out.  When all is done who does she go to for a hug.... DAD. Uh I guess mom being right there holding her head while she was vomiting and trying to wake her up when she had passed out didn't count.  But you know I don't mind, her big brother is important to her too.      Your husband will come around, if not tell him what my daughter tells her father.  Hey it was your sperm that made a girl.... lol|`|KHZLPldraa	He will change his mind I promise.  Most men are like that. They have that dream in their head, my hubby wanted a boy so bad (we already had a 12 year old girl), and turned out we were having another girl, he was sad but when she was born(she is now 17 months) she became the center of his world, and now we are finally having his boy.  Give him some time, lil girls are normally daddy's girls!
SDjrojZXaa	I have not seen those but I wish I had because I tore delivering and had stiches so it really was uncomfortable sitting so that may help. I would advise putting it in a pillowcase though because you wouldnt want to get any blood (TMI) sorry.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	That's not what they're for.  They're for putting the baby on.  I had one but never used it.|`|DHcEbZKVaa	If you have money to burn get it but the main pain is not when you sit but when you wash the area. ooooh! Yikes! I remeber it well.|`|1da22694eee1f6055b5ea295d06bcf40aa	I say it is a waste of money. The pain only last for a few days.

(:  my mom thinks every girl should have one, so thats always our baby shower gifts =P i'm getting mine in april. hahaha.|`|AA10066311	I used one.  I found it a lot more comfortable.|`|5YTWIfFdaa	yeah get one, unless you have some big rubber rings handy... its just makes things a bit "comfier" cos your gonna want all the comfort you can get down there and sittin on your stitches isnt nice (my friend who just had a baby is dictating all this to me)|`|DDFSITiYaa	Personally, I had no use for one even after 3 kids.  Get the boppy and use it for both so it won't be a waste.|`|f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	Hey, you should only get one of those if you absolutely need it. If you are having trouble sitting or something then yest get it. Other than that you dont really need it. I didnt use it with either one of my children and I didnt have hemorroids or anything like that either. I think you'll be fine without it.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	They are called boppy pillows.      Personally, I loved mine.  It was great for breastfeeding, especially after my c-section.  It was great for tummy time.  It was great for bottle feeding.   It was great for when my son was learning to sit up.  It was great for when he was learning to crawl over things, he would crawl over it forever, and I even liked it to cuddle on the couch.  I have gotten a lot of use out of mine.  My son is 1 and its still in our living room.      Ohhh.... I thought you were talking about something different.    I dunno, I think those do look comfy, but some nice soft cushy pillows will do the trick as well.
848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	Go to the same classroom and sing the song there a hunderd times. Once done, you'll be ready. It's amazing what preparation does in alleviating performance anxiety.      ps. Another really great tip is the day of the performance, just smile before you sing and say: "I'm a little nervous". Two good things happen:   1) when people hear that they automatically associate and sympathize with the person  2) You'll feel so much less nervous if you admit it in front of your audience. Not sure why this works, but it really does.|`|V2r0HRKjaa	Talk to the teacher ask if you can sing with just him or her. Then practice, practice, practice!|`|isg9i7Z4aa	hey dont be nervous when u;ve got that talent in u then y scared???be confident and present urself well in front of others...do one thing cal a friend hu is really close to u and sing in front of her and then increase the number of friends slowly and then u can sing in front of ur whole class...my friend has the similar problem and when he found some his friend smiled and asked him to calm down and dont be tensed during the singing process...so dont worry and give it ur best and do inform the result as well...|`|r1B0ZPylaa	When you're there... you're going to have to control your nerves.... it's hard at first but you have to get used to it..... just go in there and keep acting like you're not nervous till you start to believe it.... cause the more the class knows that you're nervous... the more they will pay attention. good luck.

5Bk4SYQIaa	I have to agree. I used to love the show! It was so great, and it gave me a few great tips for recipes, games and outings with your kids! :)    Now it's just like a reality tv show :(   Jon & Kate ARE using their kids to get things, and to make money, and did you see that HUGE house?!     Kate, To me, seems to nag and nag poor Jon to nothing and always tries to talk over him or control him :( Poor Guy! If I was him, I would have divorced her LONG ago! But then again, It would be very difficult for the kids and neither of them wants to go through THAT! (Or a custody case!!)    I also feel like the kids are starting to get out of control. They all scream non-stop, What happened to the quiet, kind little kids in the first season & a half?   Also, I don't like how Mady gets away with all those temper tantrums! Well, one or two now and again is normal but all the time...? She physically hurt Leah and didn't get severely punished?! I'm glad Jon tried to help the situation while Kate did nothing except obsess about mold!    Too bad :( It used to be such a great show! The kids were unspoiled, and it was just a typical day with a few vacations.     No offence if you disagree!                  - Alice            (Ella's Mommy! :) )|`|GhKz1MyXaa	I love the show. Jon and Kate only want whats best for there kids. They need more space simple as that. They let people into there lives that is there choice and the fact that both parents get to be home with thier children could be very beneficial in many ways. Besides if you don't like the show than just don't watch it. They are so blessed to be able to send all 8 kids to college and get a big house.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Those are some pretty strong feelings for two people you've never met! I agree that Kate can come off as domineering but it's a big family and leadership and planning are needed.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	You sound jealous.................|`|nYnlYAE1aa	I have tried watching that show a few times and I find it quite boring.|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	kate is intense, but who couldn't be if you had 6 unexpected babies??    where is the new house? are they still in PA?|`|s1utniuvaa	I hate Kate... on their wedding date she must have snipped his balls off and sealed them up. That poor man... she has beat him down to nothing but a sniveling little *****.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	I always thought they were both an a**hole and a b*tch. That show is also boring. "Now we're taking the kids on a trip to disney land, oh yeah they loved it. Madison was being a little sh*t though."    Kate is always complaining and Jon never cares about anything.  Of course you sound jealous, their attitudes, they're act so undeserving.|`|CMgLJI3taa	Hi I havent seen the new house but I must say that I think she is a bit of a Beeotch sometimes too.  Always yelling and nagging her husband, sometimes I feel sorry for Jon.  Haha.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Kate has always been a *****. That's nothing new.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	I find it amusing that both their show and "Little People, Big World" the families both upgraded to a huge house thanks to the money from the show. It then makes them less easy for the audience to identify with. Jon and Kate didn't accidentally get 6 babies. They had fertility treatments and wound up with twins and then were greedy. They knew what could happen. I don't think their life is that interesting to watch on TV.|`|23MPcnNqaa	How can you judge them?    Live one day in their life and see how overwhelming it can be.  Can you imagine having 2 sets of multiples?  I have 2 1/2 year old twin boys that make me want to rip my hair out some days.  Try to understand how hard everyday would be with that many children.      I actually admire and respect both Jon and Kate ALOT.  Just being able to have the strength and will to get up every morning and do what they do.|`|s30Duwdraa	I agree with you!!  Sure, they have a lot of responsibilities but i find Jon really p***ywhipped and Kate a real friggin NAG!  shut the hell up and let your kids get dirty every now and then, SHEEEESH!    I don't think the show will be on much longer.  They will start to lose their audience, especially now that they live in that house... they don't seem "real" anymore.      Not to mention all the other much BIGGER family shows there are now.  8 is nothing compared to 16 and over!!|`|oX4mg0ghaa	I love that show, I missed the last episode with the new house tho. i did notice the last 2 seasons they have changed alot. I wonder if Jon gets alot of OTHER attention now that he is a celebrity because of her insane gripping!?|`|2xS1Jro7aa	Aw I love that show! Jon is working he just works from home. And Kate has to stay on top of her kids could you imagine having 8 kids? The kids are sooo cute! And they need a big house they are a family of 10. How many people are in your family? My dads family was also a family of 10 and my grandparents had to buy a pretty big house and there still were not enough bedrooms for the kids to all have their own rooms. Think about most families the kids usually have their own rooms. Even in the house that Jon and Kate bought there is not enough rooms for each kid to have their own room. The twins still have to share and 2 of the little girls share and the three boys have to share and the other little girl gets her own room because she wakes up earlier. They bought the house in the intention of not moving again. Can you imagine when those kids are teens they are going to need all of the room! All of the money that they get for the show goes into college acounts for the kids so I think they are a great family. They take their children to church every sunday and try to spend alot of time with each of their children. Sorry that you dont like it :( maybe then you just shouldnt watch it? Do you watch the Dugger family 17 kids and counting? Now that is crazy and their house is even bigger! They have slides that go from floor to floor! I think  18 was born though so now its 18 kids and counting? I am not sure.  Edit- They did not try to have 6 babies at once they were trying for 1 the chances of even having twins is pretty rare.   The doctors even said that they were only trying for 1 and the reason that they did not reduce is because of their religion.  Edit- The duggers family home is 7000 square feet! That is a really big home! And Jon and kates house is 6200 square feet so yeah the duggers house is bigger! If you want the links that where I found that let me know I will send them to you! By the way that is not total usable space for Jon and kate since most of their basement is unfinished.  Edit- ok this is the last edit im going to do because I dont feel like sitting on here all day ranting. It really is not my fav show but I dont know why anyone would think its horible the past 2 eposodes have not been the best because they were all about moving. How ever did you forget or watch the eposode where they bought and brought all of the gifts to st. lukes for the children that have cancer and so on? Isant that teaching their children great values? From reading their book I learned that they do things like that alot. You also have to think that the one show a week usaly only 30mins long is pretty much 30mins out of their lives for close to a month. TLC choses what the eposodes are and what they choose to put on the air. They are only being taped 15% of the time. If you dont like it then dont watch it, its that easy your an adult dont watch what you dont like.
F5DCpd12aa	There is no age. I took my daughter at 3 weeks, 7 weeks, 12 weeks on a plane with no difficulty. She never cried and slept the whole time because of the lull of the engines.|`|eEK3m1aXaa	Ideally, your baby should be at least 2 to 3 months old before he flies. This will give his immune system a chance to grow strong enough to resist the germs that often make the rounds in airplane ventilation systems. It also gives the two of you enough time to settle into a routine and master the art of breast- or bottle-feeding.    If you can't wait that long, your baby should be okay to fly after his 2-week checkup  provided he has a clean bill of health and you had a full-term pregnancy without complications. Premature babies are especially susceptible to germs, so it may take longer before they're ready to go on an airplane trip.    http://www.babycenter.com/404_at-what-ag...      ~_~|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I think it would depend on the airline. But at a guess i'd say over 2 weeks old?|`|dXMdt3gVaa	You should ask your pediatrician before you fly, but I was allowed to fly from South Africa to the USA on a nonstop flight with a six week old. It was a 20 hour flight and when we took off she did cry, but once I got her sucking her dummy/pacifier, she was fine.     Make sure you get a seat behind the bulkheads and ask for a basinette! You will definitely need it!     Good Luck :)|`|33h5R8nTaa	i took my daughter at 6 weeks, i think its 2 weeks tho. The doc is going to say its fine unless they were born with a problem. just make sure to feed on the way up and the way down to help with the ears, if they dont feed eather way then make sure u have a paci or try and scedual a feeding for the way down thats usually the worst part.|`|oDyNiJi7aa	There is no age.  I would check with your doctor and see what they say.  I have three children and took them all on the plane.  What I would recommend is when you take off and start to land I would nurse/give a bottle.  This will help out a lot just like we chew gum!  ~I wish you the best!
RLP3C5dmaa	pool party :)  they can be so fun   just invite all the people you hangs out with and let them hang out at the pool     slumber party  have all the girls sleep-over  do make-up  watch scary films  bake cookies etc  get the guys to stay till 10/11pm  play games e.g. spin the bottle lol    disco  invite loads of friends  hire a hall  for a big dance party    themepark  take your closest friends for a day or two at a theme-park  soo much fun :)    hotel and/ or restaurant  hire a room in a nice hotel and have a sleepover with your closest friends  book a table at a posh(depending on budget) restaurant  invite your friends before so they can all get dressed up    limo party  go around london in a limo  did it for my 11th a ton of fun :)      it depends on what you are like e.g  - you have tons of friends/ a few close friends  -want a huge party/ wants a small but nice party  - if you want it to be really funny/ she wants it to be sophisticated  etc etc    ali, britt and cici Ox|`|NZKiSfVOaa	For my 12th birthday party I took lots of my friends to the fair.  ( i live in england, im thinking your in america so ill try and explain what a fair is cos i dunnoo if you call it that there...)     A fair is a huge ground outdoors with loads of rides, rollercoasters and stuff, but its not a theme park like disney land place, you get me?    And you could buy the tickets for them all and if you want it more interesting you could get a limo down there.    You could go to a theme park ( cheepish one) and hire the sleepover room (its a room padded so noone can hear you playing your music really loud and whatever else you do really, like laughing and screaming when you'se tell scary stories)     Have a huge garden party, with a water slide, paddling pool bouncy castle or trampoline, with water guns and water ballons and just everything outdoorsie (i had one of these, every one had soo mucch fun thhey did it for there birthdays!)    Have a sleepover and just have fun.    go to the movies.    A beauty salon then go to a resteraunt in a limo.|`|UVblLg4naa	My friend had an ice skating party when she turned 12  (I wanted one as well, but the ice rink is always closed around my birthday, dammit!)

p2Njf5gBaa	As soon as they have good upper body strenght and really good head and neck control, and also fit into the straps tightly and securely.      My son liked sitting in his car seat in the stroller, I kept it that way for a while, especially at the mall, so he could see me and it was also easier for getting him in and out of the car.     At four months there where a few times I put him in just the stroller without the car seat.  It wasn't until about 6 months, when he preferred to look around and started getting big for his infant carrier that he begin riding int he stroller regularly without the car seat.     But at 4 months my son did just fine sitting in just the stroller.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I think my son was about 4 months old when I stopped using the car seat, I just reclined his stroller (it lays almost all the way back) and he was fine. Now he sits up in it and tries to climb out of it.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Ryan is four months and can sit upright great supported of course. So we have just started putting him to sit in his stroller recently he really likes it.|`|jrVlzffeaa	When he was about 6-7months old, I think that's what they advise now? Xx|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My little girl was 1 day shy of 3 months (I have a pic on my phone) any ways she loves to sit up, and had really good head control, she was really fussy, so I took her out of the car seat, and put her in the stroller.  It's one of the bigger ones by Graco, and has the 5 point harnesses, so she would fall forward, and she loved it.  So now if we have a long day out, and it's not a time when she's usually take a nap, I put her in the stroller so she can move, and not be confined all day.  Or if where going to the mall, some place I spend a lot of time now that it's winter, I just put her in the stroller, any where really where we are going to spend more then a half hour in!    Oh, she'll be four months on the 7th, and use it all the time!|`|HGqmsaM5aa	My daugther is 11 weeks old and yesterday we went for a walk and just used the stroller she loved it! Now i think i will use the seat for a little longer only because she normally falls asleep in it and i hate to wake her up. Then again she has days that she hates it! So i think it will be soon. I can't see why not using it at this time!|`|TqOdbhNAaa	I started using a regular stroller when my daughter was 5 months.  She got too heavy for her infant carseat so we switched to a convertible carseat and a real stroller at Christmas.  In retrospect, I should've just gotten these things from the start since it would've been cheaper but it was so nice and convenient to just be able to lift her out of the car and put her on the stroller base.|`|AA11210211	I never used a duo car seat stroller combo,so I would say anytime,but I didn't start using an umbrella stroller until they could sit up on their own.
avMjefgtaa	I think 20 bucks extra $10.00 for each extra hour, but since you been taking care of her daughter for a while now u can drop it to 15 bucks... I think you should do it besides it's only 1 day a week which really comes out to 12days that's an extra $240.00. Good Luck|`|QCYad4jUaa	I would say at least 20.00...That's a huge inconvenience as you need to be well rested and ready to go for ALL the children.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	My mother runs a small home daycare as well and charge 35 dollars per child for the day.  So in your case, I would pay 175 weekly.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	i have an in home day care as well and i have been in the same situation what i do is i charge either 9 dollars per extra hr in the am  so i would charge her and additional 18$ at the end of the week and for every minute they are late when i am closed i charge and extra dollar|`|njLVIp55aa	Maybe just like $15-20 bucks more...I wouldnt over do it but its also only 1 time each week and only for 12 weeks and she is giving you plenty of notice...|`|eeGN977eaa	I think $18-20 per week would be appropriate.
KGRikkJeaa	you shouldnt be having sex...    Thanks for telling me about pork on my question, i really appreciate that you could just leave the question and had to put your pathetic imput about the digestion of a pig because I personally dont care what you think Its my life, i eat anything i want and i belive that animals were put here to be eaten. Therefore I AM GOING TO ENJOY MY PORK LOIN! i hope you choke on tofu|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Hey hun,   I know how frustrating it is to keep seeing a negative when you want a positive so bad. I used First Response Early Result and didnt get a positive until my period was 5 days late. So don't get your hopes down, you could still get your positive!  |`|OWReYgV5aa	I got a bfp on a dollar tree test called First Choice.  It honestly is a little more sensitive than most other brands...that's why I chose it.  I took it about 3-4 days before af was due and I couldn't see the line at first...but after several minutes, I could see a FAINT FAINT FAINT line.  Try one of those if you have a dollar tree around.  Good luck!!|`|4QSsJ23Caa	okay i ahve had 3 pregnancies and the first 2 i found out hte results easily.

If I was 14, I would probably say,  10 Things I Hate About You  Be Kind, Rewind  Catch & Release  Juno  No Reservations  Sky High  and maybe The Secret Window or something.  Good luck.  Also, John Tucker Must Die is excellent.

Family comedies and so called Chick Flicks would be great.     Good luck have fun|`|jwVEs7Jgaa	check this site... I have seen most of it and I enjoyed it...

qGy9fR7xaa	I totally agree - i reckon you should join a club. Is there something you like, like dancing or acting or something like that. That way you can make friends with people who are into the same things as you, and do those things together. My younger sister didn't have many close friends or go out with other people, but she did have one thing she loved doing which was a bit nerdy, but she loved playing the flute - so she joined an orchestra and all the people there were just like her, and all so nice! Now, i'm not saying "Join an orchestra!!" Just find friends in things you like doing.  Also, i think family are great friends - i grew up with three sisters around my age and me and my older sisters used to go out together and have fun, if i my friends didn't want to do anything!|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Im totally random.So that helps sometimes.Ill walk up to people and be like "omg i farted" and they all start laughing and asking me if i wanna hang out sometimes.So lighten up.Also You don't need anyone else besides yourself.Just be you and not care what others think or do.Eventually someone will see the "light in you" and talk to you.|`|V2c0dAtwaa	Everyone chooses a different path, and whoever said all "normal" 16 year olds go out alot? Just make a decision and be happy about it, if you want to be "normal" then go out there meet new people. (as easy at it sounds, it's a bit tricky to do so)|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	go to someong you might find interesting and talk to them. never wait for people to talk to you because they wont.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	you sound like me at your age.  i wish i was secure enough at that age to try and fix the problem.    best thing for you is to join some clubs and get involved in activities outside of school.  volunteer at the hospital, or do meals on wheels.  if you're having trouble in school with bullying, then you'll want to get involved in thins outside of school.|`|H90uflbFaa	make new friends|`|pcdrdQHMaa	don't worry about it. 2 years to college, which is a fresh start. All your lifelong friends will be made in college, not high school.|`|9ZTADEzTaa	Try to expand your social circle, try taking up new sports, join clubs etc, with people your age.|`|EpMwDI48aa	Maybe you could go to some club or something, like sport clubs, or young leaders. You dont just have to have friends at school.     gd luk|`|Iarvsn7yaa	OK. First of all, at your age, you should get friends who edify you.   If you cant find them, you need to do things in your social life that either build yourself up or build others up.    Now, I have the best solution for you:    Why don't you join an association/charity where they help out homeless people. They need your friendship as much as you need theirs. You'll make friends with those that also serve in such charities.   No doubt, they'll be interesting people.    Find voluntary work in a charity - any charity, and you'll make the best friends.|`|8QatPQfRaa	Try extracurricular activities at school. Go for something you wouldn't normally do. You will learn skills, create friendships, meet people you wouldn't normally meet, and travel.    I tried out for drama and debate which in my school was considered lame or nerdy. I met so many great people that I am still friends with (I'm 30), I can speak in public which is part of my career, and I developed a confidence from being on stage and acting like what was considered a dork but I had fun and so did everyone else in the club! We traveled for competitions, met other kids at other schools. And the awards can go on a resume!|`|OYzPApodaa	You need to find a hobby  so that you will have something meaningful to share  when we are young we can just talk school or music ETC  but there comes a time when more substance is needed  How about church...there are many great social activities open to the public at churches these days....shoot we have one here with a free skate park you don't even have to attend any religious stuff  Art,sports,volunteer work (like shelving books at the library)  Try to focus on your interest in your spare time instead of just "sitting"  this is your real problem if you ask me  turn off all those electronics and start working on that model car you started when you were 7  you may find this just as satisfying as chatting and hanging out maybe even more  then at least when you do find someone new to hang out with you'll have something cool about yourself to share   good luck|`|7k6ejiXHaa	hey dear,    i was some what the same and when i turned 18 i kinda went BUK wild and made alot of mistakes that i got to live with know to HAVE FUN and HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE> now at 22 i prefer to be home.    To answer your question, find things that YOU like to do, even if you have to do it yourself. adventually you will find others with the same interest. There is some much out there to do, dont limit yourself to just the NORMAL 16year old things to do.    Do you like to roller skater, is there a roller rink around you? IF there is that is always a nice place to start. The first time it may be a little difficult since you don't know anyone, but just have fun, listen to the music and roll with it.THAT will attract other people also having fun, and there you go!    good luck and have fun with everything and find your interest and your social spot in the world will come. GOOD LUCK|`|0Fy6pjsHaa	go to school and flash the guys and they will all want to be wit you.|`|dxqM7Aw3aa	Get other friends as well as your school friends.

Julianna is also nice in hebrew is like judith. names have a lot of meaning  to us.  don't call your son luis my uncle is name luis and he is such a bitter name also all the Kings of France was name Luis and they were so bitter, and control by there wives like my uncle. I) would choose solomon  at list they have the control and they are not so bitter.
cAtWxJG1aa	my area.  it would be silly to treat my peaceful suburban neighborhood as if it was some gang-ridden, violence-plagued urban center.  and if i'm looking at general trends, i'm far more interested in statistics (crimes or accidents as a percentage of total population) than random news stories.  that one child out of a million had some freak accident or was the victim of some unlikely crime really doesn't impact me in making decisions for my own kids.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I would base them on what happens in my area first, and then the entire world. I've seen 4 years olds walking to school alone in Egypt, a group of 6 year old girls catching the trains in Beijing. America is definitely not the safest country in the world, but we're not anywhere near as bad as say South Africa or Colombia.     But right here in Minnesota - if we live in an area where I'm afraid to let my 12 year old walk down the street alone, then we're going to have to move.|`|AkFag8tNaa	We live in the country and the town we're incorporated into has about 1500 residents so stranger danger is not my biggest concern (yes, I know it can happen anywhere but I'm not going to make my kids neurotic over it). We also live at least 200 yards off the actual road so that's not a big concern either. My main concerns are the day to day household accidents you hear about. I don't let them walk on the back of the couch, no roughousing near coffee tables etc..., and of course no playing around water unless I'm outside w/them.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	You have to consider it all. For example, your child's internet practices should be defined by a more global view whereas whether or not you allow your child to walk to school with his/her friends may be more dependent upon the maturity of your child, the distance of your home to the school and the general safety of your neighborhood. Bad things happen in every neighborhood, but we must balance that with the idea that if we never give our kids the opportunity to demonstrate maturity with freedom, they will never be able to do so. Good Luck, it is not easy!|`|j2mRop0laa	I go with my gut. My mom ruined me, though. She was always paranoid and never let me around me around men and stalked me when I was a teen. I was so afraid of the dark (still am) that I made my mom sleep with me till was 15. She was kidnapped as a child for a brief period, though, so I guess that excuses her.  I TRY not to be too over protective. I really have to force myself sometimes not to text and call my ten year old every 30 minutes when she is at a friends. I also let her walk a few aisles down in the grocery store by herself, but she was just grabbing one thing.   We live in a safe area. I haven't been brave enough to let them ride a school bus (that's how my mom got kidnapped which I was reminded of daily when I was little).   Maybe in middle school, next year I'll give her more roaming freedom. She wants to be dropped at the theater with her friends next year. I'm considering that freedom.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Absolutely, you need to make different decisions depending on where you live, and those are different than decades ago.    1. My parents never worried about me being on the computer... we didn't have one.  2. My parents didn't worry about me getting abducted in our small town because you either worked for or with everbody.  So we all knew where everybody was... (haha, not quite - but close.)    I don't let my son play outside alone like I did growing up... I won't let my son play on the computer unless he needs it for school.  The world is a better learning environment then a monitor.  I feel the need to teach my son about "bad guys", make him memorize his address, and our adult names (not mommy.)  And I think that kids need to learn more about the "world" not just our small communities... because as technology increases, we are closer and more intertwined with Iraq and Russia.  When I was growing up, by the time you got news, it was old.  Now when you get the news, they aren't even sure if it is right, because they said it so fast.|`|RncUc0traa	both!!!!!!|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	For the most part, it's based on the area where one lives.  I know that people who live in Greenville, Illinois (a town of like less than 7,000 people) will be way less concerned about terrible things than I would living near Philadelphia, PA.  Even though I live in the suburbs, I would never let my child walk to school or the mall, etc.  It all comes down to how comfortable the parent is with their area.      But it doesn't hurt to be informed.  Go to http://www.registeredoffenderslist.org/ and check your area.  Also, most states have a Megans Law website.  For PA it's: http://www.pameganslaw.state.pa.us/     Go to these websites and check your neighborhood.  That way you can know what areas (if any) your child should stay away from or if you'll feel comfortable letting them wander at all.  The child (if at least 12-14) should also be informed of the dangers and crimes that could happen.  Street smarts are really a needed thing, especially if you live in a big city.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	We live in a very small town in Missouri that is about 2 square miles.  We do not have to lock our house, cars or anything else and everyone knows everyone.  We mainly focus on the typical safety issues wear a helmet when riding their bike and 4 wheeler, don't talk to strangers that kind of thing.  I can not imagine living someplace where I did not feel safe with my kids walking to school or playing in their yard.  We still know bad things can happen even here and we talk to our kids about it, they know about it but we live life based on our small town and not big city life.  I want the kids t have fun and be safe but not to the point they are scared to move.
p2Njf5gBaa	Me and my best friend have gone through some rough patches as well.  She left her boyfriend and was living with me and my husband, and then all of a sudden she went back to him and didn't tell me, just told me she was working alot and this and that.  Well, I knew she went back to her boyfriend, and the fact that she lyed about it, and that I had been there for her there everything and never judged hurt my feelings.     We went 8 months without speaking.  Then all of a sudden we both became pregnant at the same time, I knew she was pregnant through mutual friends, but she didn't know I was.  Well, she called and emailed me, on my birthday to wish me a happy birthday, and I decided to try and work on our relationship.  Even though I was mad and had not responded to her before hand, I was really missed her and she felt the same way.   Sometimes it just takes a little time for them to get over there hurt feelings and be ready to move Beyond past mistakes.    I would send her a card and put a heartfelt message in it and say how much you value your friendship and miss her.  Its worth a shot and you have nothing to loose.   Me and my best friend are closer then ever now.    Good luck and hope it works out for you two.|`|NroZQN5vaa	Send her a card and include a picture of your baby and a letter explaining how you've been feeling and how much you want to put everything behind you.|`|955YoHvVaa	I would reach out to her-If she feels the same way and wants to reconnect she will..most you can do is try.|`|jgDlkSiWaa	I've been in the same situation recently. (She told me when she had some free time, we would get together. That was 3 months ago. I can take a hint)   If she wanted to be friends, she would call or email back or send a letter. I know how hard it is.   It's going to take time, but it's time to give up the friendship.   I know it hurts, but do you want to be friends with someone who doesn't want to be friends with you?    Oh and to answer your question. No I would not send her a birthday card.
q8tUfflyaa	I miss feeling the baby move.. I think the 6th and 7th month was the best for me. I wasn't huge yet, it was great. I didn't think I missed being pregnant until my girlfriend who is due any day was like oh the baby is moving. And feeling it move was amazing. Its almost like you forget what a miracle it is. Of course, the outcome of pregnancy is even more amazing then the pregnancy itself! My little girl is 2 months now!|`|bLuqWYSXaa	Sometimes I miss being pregnant in the last trimester when I was really showing I did not get that big so I was comfortable I think that was the most beautiful time|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Constantly, I  have missed being pregnant since my son was 1 week old....lol!   He just turned 1 and I hope to be pregnant again soon!      I had a wonderful pregnancy, and aside from some heartburn and constipation, I never really had too much to complain about.  I miss the feeling it gives you, I miss knowing I am caring a child, I miss feeling them move within me, I miss being pampered by my husband...lol!   I seriously LOVED being pregnant!      Jenn  -   lol, I  miss no periods soooo much too!   It was wonderful being curse free.|`|VS8mactUaa	I miscarried during my pregnancy, and I was destroyed about it, and I remember telling the bf I miss being pregnant, yeah the attention is pampering but just the feeling of knowing a little life is growing inside me made me smile. I felt warm and fuzzy, like a renewed sense for life, it was great!|`|3NyM1cq5aa	I loved being pregnant...  And I miss having him with me everywhere I go!  I loved feeling him move.  Plus, everyone is so nice to you when you're pregnant and I felt so cute.  I love being a mom, and I'm not ready for another baby anytime soon, but sometimes I do miss being pregnant!|`|tZt7fUYYaa	I miss it when Lily Anne is screaming with colic at 1am...she was much happier inside. Lol....i did enjoy being pregnant because you feel special i agree. But i feel special with my baby too as people are always telling me how totally beautiful she is....i like strangers telling me that, because they dont have to like family does. lol...but she is beautiful so iom glad she is out!|`|Grmsgziaaa	Yes, I had a hard start, but in the end my pregnancy was sooo nice, even up till the day I went to the hospital to have her. I do miss it, the nice treatment, the feeling of having a baby soon, buying new things, imagining the baby, getting kicked, the hiccups!. I miss just being pregnant, its wierd. I cant wait to be again! I want another one soon, she is 6 weeks and now is so big, I want another newborn to take care of.  Im going to wait a few years though.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	lol, after 2 kids, in my house that was enough! But I love being around pregnant moms and newborn babies. The aura of love is very calming.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	I do..I miss it more now bc my son is getting more independent and isn't a "newborn" anymore. Course don't get me wrong I love that he is growing up and doing cute stuff. But I miss the belly and feeling him kicking and waking me up at 2 am. I just don't know where the time has gone he will be one in may. Maybe later on this year I will conceive him a lil sister or brother. *crosses fingers*|`|baI5G8yLaa	I DO I DO!   i like being about 30 weeks preggers|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I miss it so much.  I noticed that for a short while after having the baby, I kept my hand on my stomach waiting her her to move.  My husband would even come by and touch my stomach--I think we both miss it.  I'm so glad to finally have her here, but I miss the little movements all day.  I loved being pregnant and can't wait until we start trying for  2!!!!!|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Yes I do.  I feel exactly how you do, like I dont miss the 8th month and being so uncomfortable. I miss the second tri mester. I also did not really have morning sickness too bad.  I do miss people offering there seats or "special treatment" but mostly I just miss feeling my baby kick and roll!|`|wKYdIaZVaa	I had morning sickness for almost 7 months straight. Everyday, all day long I would puke my life away.... Even with all the constant nausea I had there are still some days where I miss feeling Chloe kick and move from inside.     But I usually just have to look at a picture of me pregnant towards the end, and say... No thanks! LOL|`|HvALvdc7aa	Nope, Im good with having her with me on the outside. I had preterm labor at 5 months and was on bed rest until I had her. Those were some long days wondering if she was coming ,knowing that it would be to early for her to survive. You do get extra attention but I like the attention my daughter gets now more than the attention I got. She is mommy's little miracle.|`|Ezkn5azdaa	Yes I missing pregnant, My baby girl is two months old now. I have two older boys that are 7 and 4 year old. I am done having children and be getting my tubes tied. I know I be missing being pregnant.|`|BKr3y30maa	I had morning sickness EVERDAY, but one day.....but I really really miss being pregnant!|`|oDyNiJi7aa	I hear you. I do miss the baby kicking and moving.  I do miss that a lot.  Also no periods that was nice!  ~I do feel the same way!|`|0KvGgr5waa	yes i do|`|AA10145416	i sure do!!! all the attention and also it was so easy to nurture your baby cause it was inside you, and iremember how much sleep i had when pregnant, now i brely get a few hours but hey im happy with my bundle of joy as well|`|bc9inzicaa	I loved being pregnant (until the last two months when my stomach became humongous).  My entire pregnancy was easy: no sensitivity to smell, rare morning sickness, and lots of energy.  Also loved all the attention too :)    I do miss the feelings of being pregnant, with the baby moving inside and the excitement of becoming a parent; but, I also love being a parent now and seeing my child.
OQFd3pl5aa	Those silly opk's!!! I cannot wait till you use the monitor and temp, this will all be so much easier!! I'm praying you won't even need to bother with any of this next month!    If it sank, then it definitely sounds like EWCM. I cannot for the life of me figure out why you'd have all this EWCM so soon after O. I know that you can get it in the TWW, due to a second small surge of estrogen, but that normally happens later on in the LP. I typically notice that happens to me just prior to AF. I don't think you'd have that 2nd small estrogen surge so soon after O. Hmmmmm, very confusing to me, and such torture for you! :( I would just continue to listen to your body, and keep up with the good work with the BDing. Always consider yourself fertile when you see EWCM, especially when you're not sure of O. Always observe the most fertile CM you see in a day. If you see EWCM in the morning, then it seems to disappear, still consider yourself fertile. I'm thinking you've O'd anywhere from the 2nd till the 4th. It seems to coincide with more of the signs your body is giving your, minus the EWCM. Oh, the torture! I hate that this is happening, and can't wait till you can just toss those stupid opk's! Lots of luck and baby dust for you :) Sending you a big hug!|`|jaP0TANdaa	You poor thing! Sounds like your cycle is just crazy this time and pretty confusing. Whenever I'm in question... I always go off of the MOST positive OPK test reading, when I get a test line that's actually darker than the control line (if I actually get one that positive). This is obviously your highest peak of your LH surge and probably what released your egg. That being said, you could have had another peak and not tested quite at the right time to get your super positive result. Perhaps you geared up to ovulate, it didn't quite work for some reason, and you're getting ready to ovulate again? I'm sorry honey... I really can't answer this question very well. I have heard of EWCM that shows 3 days and more after ovulation. Heck, last cycle I had EWCM like 8 DPO! VERY CONFUSING. But, from what I understand it's perfectly normal (sometimes) and is usually caused by some kind of secondary surge of estrogen that stimulates your cervical mucus. Keep testing, keep baby dancing, and hopefully you'll dry up all the way soon enough so you'll know for sure that you ovulated. Good luck and tons of baby dust your way.|`|39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	I find all of those two line OPK's confusing and get the same results whether I'm ovulating or not. I recommend the CB digital one. You either get a big fat O or a smiley face. It's straightforward... and the smiley face makes you feel kind of good, like "hey, it's working!". After not ovulating for years, that smiley face was good to see!
OQFd3pl5aa	I'm so sorry to hear that the ugly witch came to crash the party :( If only she would take a 9 month vacation!     I have read that if you can collectively fill at least one tampon, then it is not considered spotting, etc, and should be considered a period. Sometimes I think we all just have off cycles. My periods are typically very heavy but every now and then I'll have a light one, which I am so thankful for ;) Sometimes a short or light period can signal a thinner uterine lining, but please rest assured that is not always the case. I know plenty of women that have short and light periods and they can conceive just fine. I wouldn't put too much thought into it at this point. It sounds as though you did have more of a period than spotting, so that should put your mind at ease a bit. This happened to me last month. I had a very unusual lighter and shorter flow, and was clinging to the thought that I might be pregant and just had an odd bleed. Not the case, but it seems I like to torture myself with these thoughts lol.    Haave you changed anything in your diet, or started any vitamins or medications? Sometimes certain things we try while TTC can make us have shorter, heavier, longer or lighter periods. Are you stresed at all? A few cycles I took baby aspirin, and that made my period last up to 8-9 days, and when I stopped my periods returned to normal. So try to think if you've added some vitamins/supplements and maybe that is what is causing this. If you're concerned about your uterine lining/short light periods, then I would let your Dr know and see what he has to say, or if he thinks you need any kind of testing. Try not to worry yourself too much, hun. It could just be that you've had a few off cycles or something. But rest assured that you can definitely conceive with short or light periods. I know people that do all the time. Sending you all the luck and baby dust in the world, hun!! :)|`|gwuTKiNXaa	It doesn't sound like a problem it just sounds like you just getting older and as a woman our bodies just change like that. you shouldn't have any problems conceiving just take vitamin and keep trying that is my best advice|`|rmse6Mj8aa	oh honey that is exactly like me last cycle. i think it was just a light period. i had a super heavy one the month before so i guess it balances out. i did really get my hopes up though. how are your breasts do they still hurt or are you pms free now?  i dont think you need to be worried sometimes we have light periods sometimes we have heavy ones. really heavy ones usually indicate problems such as endometriosis.  light periods at the worst can indicate a thin uterus lining, but by the sounds of things you are not usually so light? i really dont think it is a problem.   take another hpt if you still have sore breasts or pms signs ? my best friend had a period like yours and got a very light positive after her 'period'. if you're not preg then i still wouldnt worry i dont think a light period is a problem.    xxx baby dust xxx|`|Mj1qhzcIaa	For me it has been just the opposite.....with age my flow has become more and more heavy and somewhat painful. It ofcourse may have some thing to do with hormonal fluctuation but I do not think it indicates any major problem (I did get a US and check up recently). 3 days of flow is not bad and I think sufficient for a viable uterus lining- I get 4 days with some spotting. Also if you have lost weight or have been under some stress this occurs for some women and will sort out naturally after sometime.  If it has been a while since you did a US I think it might be a good idea to get a scan sometime in the near future. Good luck dear!
AA10063059	no neither|`|7AYnWg3paa	no|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's impossible to actually feel anything. I had a feeling that I was pregnant, but couldn't actually feel it.
GxSnVRAOaa	I know how you feel.  I went through the same thing!  I went for weeks complaining, and finally 4 days before my due date my blood pressure was so high they had to send me to the hospital to be checked out.  After a few hours I was sent home, and put on bed rest.  I spent the next two weeks on bed rest, and my baby came 12 days past her due date!  I think some doctors simple refuse to induce early...in my case my Doctor insisted waiting the full two weeks past my due date to induce me, despite me being on bed rest!!!  Unfortunately, you may just have to live with it, but I do hope you can be induced because I know how hard it is!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I think part of the issue is the weight gain. I gained 60 with my first pregnancy and felt the same way. This one I have gained 26 lbs in 26 weeks and feel much better.     Just hang in there and try to get thru it. You don't have much longer to go.|`|5EiShLZZaa	Discomfort isn't a reason for an OB to perform an induction, it should only be done when medically necessary, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, placental breakdown, changes in baby's health or mother's health, etc...but I do know how you feel!  I had carpal tunnel in both hands I couldn't zip my pants or hold a fork they were so numb...I had to wear flip flops everywhere because I couldn't get any shoes on, I had extreme swelling...I have a pelvic disorder and couldn't get in bed the last three months (slept on the couch) and had to have help getting in the shower.  It was terrible, but I knew the longer baby stayed in the healthier he'd be.  My OB does inductions at 7-10 days overdue, I was induced at day 10. You don't have too far to go, although I know it's an eternity in pregnancy...good luck|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	Ask if it would be safe to induce labor. You could be developing toxemia if you as swelling that much.    Get to your local hospital and get checked out, especially if your doctor isn't helping you.|`|0RoI6OXEaa	I had the same feeling with my last baby. I ended up crying in the doctors office while explaining how I felt. I was also at 38 weeks. she induced me 2 days later. I hope this helps.|`|AA12064250	I too am in a similar situation.  I have not gained as much weight however.  But, being swollen, contant headaches, 4 false labor episodes and a 3yr and 7yr old at home.  I am so done!!  My dr. has informed me that she is not allowed to induce labor unless there is a medical reason to.  Like high blood pressure, fetal distress, etc.  So, tomorrow I am having her do a procedure to try to start my labor.  Its called membrane stripping.  Maybe give it a try...best of luck!!|`|WLtsumGBaa	80Lbs!! thats quite a bit of weight for anyy body to handle in such a short period of time. sorry to say but you shouldnt of let that happen. all i can suggest is to express in annoyance and fustration to your dr and he may just induce you today.|`|E1ppYqCtaa	Ask your DR. at the next appointment to stretch your membranes. It may hurt, but YOU WILL GO INTO LABOR!!!! What the doc will do is when he checks you he will try to work his finger or fingers into your cervix to stretch it open some it will activate contractions and then again it start leaking fluid right there. Good luck.
cypZ0ykXaa	many of them feel the symptoms 5-6 days after missing their periods.some will not hav any except the baby movements. first symptom generally be nausea, vomitting, sore breasts.later on tiredness, lots of sleep, frequent urination, light stomach cramps, white discharge etc|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I knew 3 days after conception.     queasy  tired  dizzy|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i had pregnancy symptoms at around 4 weeks (now i know that i am 1 weeks ahead than they first thought - so 5 weeks)    my breast were sore  my period was lighter than usual  i felt like i had the flu  i would be hungry after i had eaten 30 minutes before  i was so sleepy|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	with both my pregnancies my symptoms started as soon as 6 weeks.  With my 1st pregnancy my breast were sore and i had really bad morning sickness for the whiole 9 months with a baby girl.  this pregnancy i started with morning sickness and was sick for only the 1st trimester (3 months). This one is a Boy|`|Y4DPDmrfaa	Most women start getting symtoms between 6 and 8 weeks. I didn't really have any, I threw up one time, and that was my only symptom, but from then on I felt nauseous if I didn't eat. My boobs haven't really been sore, but thats a very common early symptom. Also your sense of smell might be heightened, and of course, the missed period. Some women have a very light period when their pregnant, but its really just implantation bleeding, it only occurs 30% of the time. If you think your pregnant, take a test! And start prenatal vitamins right away! Its very important in the first trimester.
200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	I think that is a wise choice to wait til you are older and ready. Also to not get involved in nonsense things like drugs etc.      It is sad there is those who are not as wise and makes teenagers, like yourself, pay the negative judgment of a teenage life.     The pregnancy itself is different for each person and each pregnancy is different too. Many girls that I know have or are pregnant would agree that this pregnancy was different from the last. Whether positive or negative difference.    Some have morning sickness, next time they only have slight nausea. Some have a hard time emotionaly while the next, they are happy go lucky.      As far as labor itself also depends on the women. Some women have higher pain tolerances than others.     Some prefer pain relief medications or opt for C-sections, which recovery time sometimes is far more weeks than vag.inal delievery. (My step sister three c-sections for example).     If have vag.inal and have to be cut (episomity) can increase the amount of time to heal and irritation with stitches etc.     The actual delievery itself, I often hear women say it "feels good to push" due to the pressure, but there is parts where it hurts, especially if they tear, get cut or if other complications.    After the delievery of the placenta, the euterous will contract for awhile and the women will be sore for awhile. That is why it is best to wait for the 6 week check up before deciding on sex etc.     I always hear that the pain is "forgotten". It is a weird pain that once it is over with, you can not explain nor have anything to compare it too.     Once it is over with and you have your bundles of joy in your arms, all that pain does seem to not matter and fade away as now the baby is soaking up that attention. (Replacing that negative with a positive).    Now I wish we can let men go through labor. I think that might help solve alot of their opinions on labor and what it does to our bodies!|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Your ermm "Question" makes no sense.|`|dcovK6oqaa	women are much tougher than you think. well you can always put anesthesia before birth, its worth it, after wards when you have the baby in your arms. its a wonderful experience. and you forget all the pain of child birth afterwords.|`|iuB1BRj5aa	Adopt, that's what I'd like to do.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Well first of all Great choices for your self.     On your main question the honest thing its more or less you know your bringing a child in the world and at the end you forget all the pain, all women forget the amount of pain after its done. There is also the good old epidural and that does a great deal of knocking out most of the pain there.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	They have epidurals now, so you don't feel a thing.  And you go girl! One of the only sensible teens that gets on this site.|`|4DoXomHZaa	You are very smart. Go to college, meet and marry your husband, then have babies.    Some women "can't" deal with it and get epidurals-big needles in the spine to completely numb themselves so they do not feel the baby being born at all. Some actually have elective c-sections  to avoid pain in the normal area.    Some woman-up and give birth like millions of women did before all this pain killer stuff.|`|YseGAHIfaa	ok then, good for you|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Giving birth is painful, but it's really not that bad in the scheme of things...and epidurals help.|`|MCTyWCu2aa	Well when you do get pregnant you will understand. You will go threw any amount of pain to see your little bundle of joy.|`|wgCINuZvaa	More power to ya!!! YAY!!!! Idk, I've never had a baby, but I'm positive it's worth it and idk, powers from within prolly overcome you and ur like superwoman or something lol- Best wishes and stay true 2 yourself! :D|`|2QFe7onpaa	First of all, congratulations for being responsible! It takes a lot not to go with the crowd.    The pain of labor. Drugs are a very good thing for those who feel okay with it. They can give you an epidural which helps block the feeling below your waist.     Really though, pain is mind over matter. Do you ever notice how if you wear cute shoes and they give you a blister, yeah it hurts like hell, but if you think you look cute enough it's worth the pain? Same thing for child birth. Giving life to something is worth that pain, the effort. When it comes down to it, women are amazing and can survive just about anything. Mind over matter. Pain is only temporary.|`|H90uflbFaa	haha im with you on this one. when im in my late 20's im adopting a kid from a foreign country.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	its scary for all of us. but i think when the time comes & we actually are pregnant & close to giving birth our bodies are ready. we know in our hearts that having this baby may hurt but just seeing him/her is what everyone is so ansy for when theyre in their third trimester that they dont even care how bad it hurts|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	epidurals, im not a girl but i have seen the needle and it works but if your afraid of needles close your eyes when you get it.    also i am 19 and never broken a bone or gotten stiches, never done drugs or drank and never will drink, and i am a virgin till marriage. just telling you this so you know it can happen for that long.|`|wYaM0UJUaa	you're not unusual for not drinking or smoking, ok? You're not some sort of special breed. The majority of people are like that.    Anyway, its because you get something that you'll love more than anything and will provide a lifetime of joy. The pain is worth it.|`|mZJcZ07Haa	Well I really dunno how to answer it. Pain is the price we have to pay for new life... like those 9 months are not enough.......    I think the best answer for that is we'll find that out ourselves one day.........|`|fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	it is so hard having a baby the pain is out of this world but you have to deal with it.... you got pregnant and you have to get him out some how... :)|`|dV9MRBfwaa	You will grow up one day and feel that maternal Instinct and you wont even think about the pain, your bringing life into the world! the last thing your worried about is pain. plus there are really great meds to help. good luck hope you figure it out|`|Tgt3cRF7aa	u r a smart baby|`|sgPga9aUaa	This is kind of a hard question, because it is different for every delivery.  I had no pain with my first on and a lot of pain with the second and of course all the pain was gone after she was born. I would have to say you just have to wait and find out for yourself how you're going to deal with it.  Also kudos to you for thinking smart about the drugs and drinking and the timing as to when you would like a baby.|`|8QatPQfRaa	I know how you feel. I don't care for kids. When I was younger, my older sister got to do the babysitting so I never learned.  Kids are exhausting.  You have plenty of time.  I'm 29 and am just now realizing that maybe...just maybe, I might want a child.  It's totally normal to be unsure or even plain ol don't want one. Nothing wrong with that. It is a woman's choice for her body and SANITY.
VdI879HUaa	Yes Yes Yes I am wanting to lose weight while TTC I have started Weight Watchers this week how funny omg I am glad to be in the same situation. I think while I am waiting might as well concentrate on loosing weight as I am a few kilos overweight for my height and age I would like to lose 10kg.     Its so frustrating when you want to concieve but I know I need to lose weight.    I am here for you xxxxx  Kass|`|h0CtylDMaa	not finding it hard at all! if uwant i can share with u what im doing, although idk what u usually eat in a day, i can give u my new meal plans and u can try them if u want. i also exercise . but have lost more weight quickly than i thought i could or would.    just email me or im me!    armyangyl@yahoo.com|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	I'm not trying to lose weight now as i just found out that i am pregnant but i can tell you this......we had tried to get pregnant for 13 months and this month i was like you know what forget it im not stressing about a babay anymore. I went to the gym got a trainer worked out with him 3 days a week and now im pregnant. so i def think this will be a great way for you to get your mind off of things and also help you to be more fertile!!!!|`|TrBoPj92aa	yes desperately ! i had twins in september and still have a stone and a bit to loose. I was originally a 10/12 and my boobs are massive from breastfeeding both of them and my tummy just hangs out! Im 11 stone and my ideal weight is 9.5stone! I tried really hard to loose weight for christmas and i have lost two stone but then i put more weight on over christmas!! I don't fit  into any of my 12's i'm wearing size 14/16 and i desperatly need to loose a couple of dress sizes!   Before i fell pregnant i was a 34C now im a 38 DD =( there so painful, at least my partner likes it!!!    Good Luck at weight watchers keep us posted on how you get on because i might consider joining!    Maisey xx|`|rZXQvA75aa	Yes I am finding it so hard! I am so tempted all the time to stray from my diet! And the lack of motivation to work out. Whenever I do work out I think I tend to over do it because any time I get on the elliptical I tell myself that I'm losing weight to make it easier to conceive when we start trying again in April and then I'm sore for days so I don't work out and it's a horribly vicious cycle! LoL, but I'm trying. I just bought myself a body ball to sit on at work instead of my work chair and I can already feel my abs burning after only a couple hours!|`|TtutLPsQaa	Good for you! That's great news! I'm trying to lose about 20 pounds, swimming and exercising. It is difficult, but worth it!|`|RPszYGXkaa	Wow, I think we all have the same thing in mind.  After I had a chemical pregnancy in the fall, I said I would stop actively TTC (no opks, etc...just having fun with hubby and what will be, will be).  So I joined a gym!  I have lost some weight and feel good.  This is our first month back "actively TTC" and it is stressful already, may go back to "not" trying soon.  Best wishes!!!|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Yes that is a good idea!  My older sister did weight watchers and she lost over 100lbs in a year.  She looks really good now.  Good Luck with your diet.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	weight watchers is amazing! the best way to lose weight yet stay healthy  i had terrible trouble losing weight yet in the 1st few wks of joining i lost pounds and felt fantastic  good luck x|`|gwuTKiNXaa	my mom went on weight watcher over a year ago with a my aunt and uncle and her best friend and they all lose a bunch of weight.. my mom alone was a big woman and she lose over a 100lb and see really looked good after she did it|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I know a lot of people go, Hmph when I say I'm trying to lose weight, but I AM.  I'm having a hard time getting my baby fat off.  It's awful.    I gained 52 pounds while pregnant and it's really getting me down.  I'm currently taking relacore.  You may like that!  =)    Also, I admire you trying to lose weight.  It can be hard, but it's so rewarding!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Sigh, yes - I have lost at least 2 dress sizes, approaching 3 and yet I haven't lost a pound.   I exercise more then I did 5 years ago and my stamina is greater then I had even 10 years ago and I am as fat as ever.   I am presently thinking about doing a lap band, I wasn't happy with Weight Watchers when I was a new teenager - and with my diet restrictions it won't work right very easily anyway.    But, have comrades in the fight to eat healthily is very helpful and has helped a lot of women, and men, loose weight.|`|b0e9ea8aa843686326e2afbe57d49ddaaa	Weight watchers is the best diet out there before i was pregnant with my son i lost 30 lbs in 6 months and when i did get pregnant i did stay on the diet , i just used the max points all day so the baby got enough food.  i didnt loose any weight but i maintained i only gained 20 lbs my whole pregnancy but the most i gained was the last month which is all baby weight.  I loove weight watchers i have struggled with weight for few years now and i finally found a diet that is easy to follow and at the same time very healthy and it works.|`|zdlLVB1Kaa	After 8 months of not getting pregnant, my husband and I decided to try to lose some weight so we are doing Slim-Fast.  I figure as long as I don't lose massive amounts of weight at any given time then I should be ok with getting pregnant.  As far as I can tell, my cycle is still the same so I guess I am doing alright that way.  And hopefully my husband's weight loss will help his sperm too.  Maybe this month will be our lucky month.|`|Mj1qhzcIaa	OMG that is what I thought last month and joined the gym.  While it felt good to be back and working out a nice sweat I found that during ovulation if I worked out hard I would get some bleeding! So tried to work out at a cool pace and not try too hard. This used to be a problem for me earlier too but recently it has gotten worse (doc said could be due to hormone fluctuation- rare and happens to select few- damn me!!).   Anyways just wanted to say that its a good idea but remember not to over do it.....because if you suddenly loose significant amount of fat your hormones fluctuate somewhat...which will take longer to get pregnant. So regular light and active workouts are the key.  Good luck and break a leg (not literally!!)!!|`|10mOwk0Taa	I was trying to lose weight before I got pregnant, I lost a few pounds in the first few weeks, but then I found out about the baby and had increase my calorie intake!  I've only gained 3 pounds though and I'm 9 weeks, so even with the increase, I've been maintaining good weight gain for the pregnancy (which can be as hard as losing weight).    I've heard from a few of my friends that they had great success with weight watchers.  Good luck and good for you for getting healthier before your baby is on the way!|`|ec5386a5779664ccb0217f9b4d534397aa	I'm counting points right now. I started trying to lose weight December 26th and actually started counting points 2 weeks ago.  Since December 26th I have lost 8lbs.  It's better to lose a little at a time NOT a lot at once.  I also started using my bender ball, ab rocket, running in place 5 minutes, doing squats with 8lb dumb bells, and doing side lunges.  I really have noticed that my legs have gotten smaller along with my stomach.  I have went from 159 to 151 in 6 weeks.  I haven't done ANY exercising except walking about 2-3 times a week for 30 mins in the past 2 weeks and i'm still losing weight.  GOOD LUCK you will like weight watchers.  DO NOT get discouraged because it is a real adjustment for your body to get used to but it's worth it in the long run.  I started trying to lose weight becuase we are trying to get pregnant and I figured the better in shape I am when I get pregnant the better off I will be during pregnancy!!!|`|sk46uigvaa	I think that's a great idea!!    It's a proven fact that your more likely to have trouble TTC if you are underweight or overweight.      Good luck!! x|`|ccqOhsGtaa	I am also ttc & last August found out that I have PCOS so I started Tesco Diets & did the Gi Diet, I lost 2stone & got my BFP in December but sadly had a miscarriage but I have not given up hope.    Good luck & you feel so much better when you see the weight coming off.
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I thought it hurt a lot! I had a lot of cramping and some moderate bleeding afterwards. He said he wanted to try it so that "we could get this show on the road" lol. They basically use a finger or two to separate your bag of waters from your cervix (you have to be dilated to certain point, I was 3 cm) and it can sometimes cause labor. I had it done twice and the second time I was back at the hospital 12 hours later and I had my son almost exactly 24 hours after the procedure.|`|AA11795652	It doesn't hurt, but it's slightly uncomfortable.  My doctor did it to help induce me and all she did was move her fingers around the cervix to help break it up.  After that, every time I went the restroom, I lost a little bit more pink tinged mucus plug.  I ended up being induced in the hospital two days later anyways.
AA12225859	You could be.  I am 31 weeks pregnant right now (YAY!!) and I had taken a pregnancy test and it said neg one day, then a week later I tried again and it was positive.  :)|`|gwuTKiNXaa	wait a week or so retest you may have tested just a little to early if you ovulated late and didn't know that you did
98WKYtfwaa	Don't worry, you're doing more than most pregnant woman do!    I hate fruit and veg but when i fell pregnant i was the same as you, i just started drinking fruit juices and including veg into my main meals, i was getting about 3 portions a day. I still eat a good balanced meal and took my prenatal vitamins. I drunk water too.     When i reached about 13 weeks i hated the sight of fruit, i couldn't eat it at all or even drink it. So i stopped getting fruit each day, i continued to drink 4 glasses of water a day and a couple of glasses of milk. With my eating habits, i didn't eat anything junk and i eat every 3 hours and made sure it was stuff my baby would benefit from.    Now i can drink apple, orange and cranberry juice but that's it. My baby is completely healthy and i'm glad. I felt bad for not eating as much fruit and veg as i could, but i found that compensating with good meals and eating regularly was ok.    EDIT - Drey said don't eat meat, well that's completely false, you can eat anything you want in moderation, some things you need to stay clear off such as blue cheeses and liver because of the high vit A content.    I eat mince, steak and roasts like twice a week, it's one thing i'm loving in pregnancy is a good bit of meat! You need the goodness from the meat.     Eating a range of things such as eggs, cheese, meats, potatoes, rice, pasta, beans, soups, breads, cereals, fish etc etc. That's all stuff you and your baby need.|`|H2ciLJoPaa	Just make sure you eat enough of the fruits and veggies that you do like because once you start getting constipated you'll really need that fiber in your diet!   What about trying different salads? everyone likes salad!|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, your prenatal vitamins will cover the shortfalls in your diet.  Just do the bes you can.  There's no reason to force yourself to choke down foods that you hate. (Esp. if they make you sick.)     Carbonated beverages, incidently, will not harm your baby.  Just try to avoid diet sodas, and limit your total caffeine intake.|`|ROJans2Taa	just keep taking your prenatal, you should be fine, it's great you made your doc aware, she will let you know if she's concerned that your missing out on something, my problem was meat, I couldn't really eat it till I hit around 7 mths then I started craving A&W real bad,lol it may have been greasy but it at least had protein.I think you should be fine. I also think it's great your so concerned. best luck|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I did the first few weeks, then once I was out of the 1st trimester i was able to eat better.     The prenatal will help, but nothing takes the place of good eating habits while pregnant.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Just eat the foods you enjoy. I didnt eat prawns when i was pregnant or mayonnaise as it contains egg white but aint pretty much everything. Just keep caffeine from coke, coffee to 3 mugs a day and drink plenty of water.|`|PA5iBQZAaa	what about the fruit juice made from V8 i dont think its that thick anyways you probably are doing great ive always heard also when you have a salad try romaine lettuce because the iceberg doesn't have very many nutrients,add carrots and raisins and nuts and stuff try new things raw such (as fruits and veggies)never meat :) anything high in folic acid alot of cereal like brans have high foilic acid which is great for baby's development i think your doing great though these are only suggestions but your going to be fine and a good mommy good luck i will continue to pray for your husband as well as all the troops good luck and God Bless you! and enjoy your beautiful miracle :) when she/he comes and you are doing so much more then some women who treat pregnancy as a way to be unhealthy or abuse their bodies more|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Your vitamin will help fill in the gaps in your diet but you shouldn't rely on it completely. Make sure to take the vitamin with a meal that has some fat in it (almost everything has fat in it!) because many of the nutrients in the vitamin are fat-soluble, meaning you need some fat for your body to absorb it.     Your appetite will likely get better in the coming weeks as you move away from the first trimester. Hopefully you can broaden your range of vegetables. (The darker/brighter the fruit/vegetable- the more nutrients)    Keep up your water consumption, that is very very good for the baby. Your baby's amniotic fluid is replaced every three hours so plenty of water is a must!    Did you try the V8 fruit drinks? They have veggies in them too but you can't taste them. You could also get some frozen fruits, yogurt, ice and milk and make a fruit smoothie (fruits and calcium in one go). I like frozen berries, 1/2 banana, 1 cup vanilla yogurt, Ice and some milk, its almost like a milkshake and very yummy. You could also use other juices depending on what fruits you are using.    I am sure your baby is fine! I know a woman who had severe morning sickness through her whole pregnancy (she had an at home IV to keep her hydrated) and she could barely eat. She gained only 8lbs her whole pregnancy and her baby was fine!|`|AA10506154	Your baby takes all the nutrients from your body, so as long as you're healthy, the baby should be fine. Drink lots of water and take your vitamins!! The baby takes a lot of calcium, so drink milk! The nutritionist I had told me to drink Ensure. I didn't like it, but I chugged it anyway.
b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	Well, with second pregnancies and anymore thereafter the baby's head generally drops and engages 24 hours before the labor. In first pregnancies it is 2 weeks before. What I did to make the baby engage was walk, every night for one hour and I rode a stationary bike for 3 miles the first night (friday) and two the next day. I walked one hour every day since that Friday. My appt monday the baby went from being 'still way high. not dropped.' to 'holy. oh wow. yeah, she's really really low. ready for birth position' I don't think you can dilate without the head being there to sort of rub it away. Try to get the baby down and I would imagine your labor will go fast from there. People can become and stay dilated for sometimes 5 or 6 weeks and make no progress in between then. A cervix can also ripen, efface, and dilate literally overnight.     Best of luck. Hope your cervix decides to cooperate.|`|myEwHgI1aa	Have you tried walking? Walking can help the baby move down and get him in the right position.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	With a 2nd pregnancy you can go into labor pretty quickly, and yes with a second pregnancy when the baby drops (head engages) is usually 24 hours before the onset of labor.   Relax, you have two more weeks before he's overdue - this will happen.|`|MtC3CWZraa	I can't say that I know more than your doctor, but my understanding is that subsequent babies only engage shortly before labor begins.     It's literally that the baby will drop and then things get moving.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	The pressure from the baby's head is what causes you to dilate so if the head isn't there then your cervix will not change.  I was induced at 37 weeks but never made it passed 1cm because he was too big and couldn't get close to my cervix.
hqogf9oGaa	Hi my husband in a semi-professional photographer however, since we live in Dundee I think this may be a bit far for you to travel.    He suggested that you get in touch with your local college if they do a photography course.  The students are often looking for models (of all kinds) and would more than likely do the photos for free, giving you a copy of all the images on disc in return for having "rights" over the images - in other words you giving permission for the photographer to use the images if they need to.    Don't be put off by the term student either - they have to demonstrate a talent for photography before eing accepted on the course and you will also find some who are studying to HNC/D level or perhaps moving on to a degree.    I hope you find someone though - a lot of photographers over charge by huge amounts, for maternity, baby and wedding photos in particular.  I have told my hubby that he will only ever be allowed to charge an ethical, reasonable fee.    If you don't want to do that then maybe put an ad on your local gumtree saying photographer wanted and what you are looking for then they can find you!    Hope this helps!    Indigo    xxx
ZbnxGIsnaa	Yes, you and your doctor are right.  Spotting and light to moderate bleeding is perfectly normal in your first trimester.      Occasionally, a woman will continue to have a small, red or pinkish vaginal loss for a day or so around the time that their period would have been due (for example at around 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of the pregnancy). This is more common during early pregnancy, but can persist into later pregnancy as well.    Some women will experience bright spotting (fresh bleeding), or brown spotting (bleeding that happened a day or so ago), at some stage during their pregnancy. This may appear as a heavy bleed (like a period), a 'light period', or as something that she notices when wiping herself after going to the toilet. About 50% of women who experience bleeding during the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy will continue to experience a normal pregnancy. However, up to 50% of women will experience a miscarriage at some point after the bleeding starts. Early pregnancy bleeding is usually investigated by an ultrasound.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Levels double everyother day.   I had my period for the first 3 months of my first pregnancy and everything turned out okay.     There is nothing you can do to stop it.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Bleeding early on can be caused by irritation to the cervix (like if you're recently had sex).  Your HCG levels indicate you're pregnant; but what you need to do is have them checked again to make sure the number is increasing.  As far as stopping a miscarriage, there is nothing that can be done.|`|7uy8iy7laa	Bleeding can occur frequently in the first trimester of pregnancy and may not be a sign of problems.   If you get bad cramps call your doctor. But I don't think you have anything to worry about. :) The sites below are very helpful.|`|c1399de03ef647ddb85fb6f6fd6f6c2baa	You're understandably scared, I would be too x. Bleeding in pregnancy is never 'normal' but it is common. Your HCG levels are showing that you are pregnant, do you have to go and have some more blood work done to show that the levels are rising? HCG should double every 24-48 hours. Try not to worry, I know it's hard, lots of women bleed and go on to have healthy pregnancies and babies x|`|N6vEZVNEaa	don't worry you will be fine it is not time yet|`|0VHolTVEaa	Bleeding doesnt neccessary mean miscarriage, some women have it in early and late pregnancy so dont worry, Unless your having stomach cramps all should be fine just enjoy your pregnancy and think positive. Wait untl 12 weeks when u have yr first scan and u will be amazed. Good luck|`|BdhoNlaLaa	The best thing you can do is listen to your doctor and relax.  The more you stress the worse it will get.  While you are spotting just take it easy and off your feet as much as you possibly can.  If your miscarrying it is the only thing that may help.  If you fill a pad, or have severe cramping call your doctor otherwise just take it easy.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Looks like your hCG level in falling in line with being 4-5 weeks pregnant. Pregnancy is counted form your LMP so that may be why you say 1-3 and the levels say 3-5.    Here are the average hCG levels:    3 weeks 5-50  4 weeks 5-426  5 weeks 19-7,340  6 weeks 1,080-56,500  7-8 weeks 7,650-229,000  9-12 weeks 25,700-288,000|`|YhjFiVGyaa	first off you are probably more like 5-6 weeks pregnant. if a pregnancy is confirmed, then they begin the weeks at the first day of your last period. so at the end of ur term, you are biologically 38 weeks, but technically, 40. (for the 2 weeks it takes for implantation and stuff)...at 5 weeks or so you should be up around 400 miu.   bleeding is never good...some pinkish brownish discharge maybe, but RED blood, no.  Before I had my daughter I was pregnant.  around 3 weeks I began to bleed. It stopped a bit then 2 weeks later returned. I felt NO pain or cramping, just the blood was scary. One night I decided to hit the ER and I went to the bathroom.  When I reached down to wipe, I felt something slide out of me and I actually caught the fetus in my hand.   If you are going to miscarry, then its going to happen. Its natural selection, the bodies way of expelling something that didnt form properly.   The blood I had wasnt enough to soak a pad or anything, but I had red streaks when I would pull down my pants.   Just take it easy and if the bleeding doesnt stop, then something may be wrong. I am not writing this to scare you, and hopefully its nothing, but really, no red blood is fine when you are pregnant...some women do have periods iinto their first trimester so this may  be it.  however the majority doesnt. just keep hanging in there. if it happens, what can you do.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Hey hun,  Calm down, the best thing for you to do would be to go on to the equivalent of bedrest. When you arent at work do your best to relax and sit down, dont do too much physical work. I had the same at 5-6 weeks. The doctor told me that  its your body is used to having a period so its still trying to release blood. If you arent having clots, or super painful cramps, I wouldnt worry.  
cj7sSPZEaa	When you start to feel that way have something to eat and drink a glass of water.  Low blood sugar or dehydration could be the cause.  It could also be from a drop in your blood pressure.  Stand up from sitting positions slowly.  It is normal to feel dizzy when you are pregnant.  Your body is working twice as hard to get nutrients and blood to the babies.  Take a nap during the day if you are able to, and if not then make sure you are getting enough sleep at night.  Sit down and rest whenever possible and if you can, raise your feet up on a stool.|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	In my early pregnancy I got dizzy a lot if I was standing too long, or cooking with my belly any where near the heat, and right before I would get some nausea or vomitting from 'morning' sickness    It's perfectly normal, just stay up on your fluids and lay/sit down if you are up when you feel like this.
zHXrvjBHaa	i was i child like this in school the best way you can help him is to get him a TO DO BOX my teacher made it up for me when i was his age its a box where you put all the things he needs to get done in it and he will work on one thing at a time if you try to make him go faster his only going to make him rush and feel like nothing he dose is right and that cause a child to get up set but if his only working on one task and still getting overwhelmed he might not understand what his doing  so slowly explain it again  i hope i help|`|US3vR8M0aa	Poor guy. I think a child therapist would maybe help, or teach him how to relax. I am sorry I am not particularly helpful. Hope he gets better.|`|t9htoO50aa	Encourage him to do things and when he does praise him for doing a good job.|`|LGidAYDwaa	Teach him relaxation techniques he can do at school or at any other place where he might need them. My daughter (she's 4 now) has learned breathing exercises - basically, she breathes deeply and focuses on that breathing. After a few breaths, she usually begins to calm down. Sometimes she'll be so upset that she'll say it's not working (this is after just a breath or two!), but I'll encourage her to keep going. I also do the breathing with her, since it also calms me down enough to deal with her anxiety in a healthy way.    I only use the breathing techniques with my daughter since she's pretty young, but you can find other techniques here:    http://school.familyeducation.com/learni...    You can see if your doctor can offer any other advice.  You may want to have your son diagnosed with whatever is causing his anxiety - like ADHD, emotional disturbances, or Asperger's Syndrome. All are considered "disabilities". If you can get a diagnosis, then you can get together with your son's teachers/supervisors to create an education plan (IEP) for your son that includes time to himself in a quiet place each day as well as a "free pass" he can use to escape the classroom if it gets too stressful, overwhelming, or loud. While he's gone, he'd be doing relaxation techniques or could visit the guidance counselor - anything that makes it easier for your son to learn in the classroom would be a huge bonus for him.  It might also help your son if any instructions the teacher gives can be written down by the teacher and given to your son before class begins - then your son would have a chance to go over it and prepare himself for that class period and he wouldn't have to be stressed out about trying able to remember it all.    http://kidshealth.org/parent/growth/lear...  more about IEPs and who is eligible    If it's too much for you to teach your son the relaxation techniques (some kids just balk at anything parents suggest!), you might want to find a child counselor. My son went to see a music therapist who specializes in childhood counseling, and she was a huge help when it came to his anxiety issues.    Good luck!
hkQSqPEwaa	My husband's nephew was raise my my mother in law and father in law- the kid called them "mom and dad"  the mom is on drug and the daddy is unknown.  the mom was a hooker.   He is now 18 and so mess up in the head.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I went through this same thing with my stepdaughter.  Her bio mom wasn't around since she was a baby, and she was calling not one, but BOTH of her grandmas mommy.  It was very bothersome to me, because I felt like it was confusing for her to have two "mommies".  This is something I feel pretty strongly about, just because of my situation with my stepdaughter, and I do not feel that it is right.  However, as long as she knows that he isn't really her dad, and that he is her grandpa, and that no one is telling her to call him that, it's probably not really that big of a deal.  If she's been told about her dad, and she does it more when she's asked not to, it sounds like she's doing it out of rebellion, or maybe she's angry at her mom that she's not raising her and wants to do something that she knows will get under her skin?|`|kprKXEOSaa	The man who is raising your neice is her father, biological relationships don't really matter.  The man who does the job earns the title.  It is your sister that has a problem.  She is making a big deal of it because she is embarassed that she isn't raising her own child.  Calling grandpa "dad" isn't damaging for the girl, having a mother who makes a big deal of it is.|`|oX4mg0ghaa	i'm sorry, but why should it be any of her concern if she can't even raise her child?

They should not have to worry about nonsence like that when their stepping up to the plate and doing what they need to do, what the mom won't do.|`|hieQHR0daa	At five she doesn't think of the man she calls dad as the one who was involved in her creation. She is thinking of him as a father figure. She may call him dad because her mother does as much as for any other reason. At 5 she sees her friends have a mother and a mature male is called DAD. I don't think anyone who works with children would be at all concerned about this unless there was reason to think that her grandfather was a danger to her in any way. It might be easier for the family to have grandfather referred to as Papa but that would also require the child to change what she calls him and that might not be so easy to accomplish.  It seems much more normal to a 5yr old to call the responsible male in your life dad than to use any other name.|`|rcdTluUjaa	To her he is a father figure, it makes perfect sense, and is perfectly normal. If she is being raised by grandma and grandpa, chances are she is also using it as a way to get back at her real mother, as it sounds like she is still around and isn't happy about it. I don't know if dfacs is your version of social services, but i find it highly unlikely they will do anything at all. The only thing her calling him dad proves is that the poor kid has a stable environment with people she trusts. My nephews called me mom until they were 4 or 5 and they lived with both of their parents, it was just what they called me, and no amount of convincing could get them to call me anything else. Luckily my sister and I thought it was funny, but sometimes it was all out confusing trying to figure out which "mom" they were calling for. Eventually they outgrew it and I became aunt sarah. I'm sure your niece will be just fine, and she is lucky to have your parents to take care of her|`|dXMdt3gVaa	The poor girl is just looking for a father figure and luckily she has found it in the poor grandfather. I think the mother should just back off (since shes not raising them anyways) and let the girl call him Dad. I would still talk about her 'real dad' but just let the girl call her grandfather Dad because thats the role he is playing in her life. Its quite cute if you think about how well she has bonded to her grandfather. Man why do people have to cause such trouble. The poor little girls in a bad situation anyways with a biological dad who is not in the picture anymore.     The mother sounds like she needs to go to rehab or something....     Good luck to that poor little girl. Shes so LUCKY to have decent grandparents.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	I think it's more than normal. Being a father to someone is more than just genetics. Even though your niece may know that her grandpa is her grandpa she seems him as her father as he is her main father figure.    When my son was 10 months old my husband went off to military training for 6 months. My father was the key male figure in our sons life at this time and after a while our son would call my father, "Da da."    Once my husband was back from training and the key male figure in our sons life again it didn't take long for Zack to start calling my husband "Da da".|`|CMgLJI3taa	My first reaction to your question was going to be that it is a little odd. . . . . but the fact that she knows he is not her dad and she is still calling him that, maybe she just feels like he is "that" man in her life and since her dad is not in the picture she feels like her grandpa is filling that spot for her.  Since she is only 5 I think that they should just let it go for awhile and not make such a big deal out of it and eventually I think that it would stop, I mean once she is older and understands that he is not her dad and that grandpa is still a meaningful term that she can call him.
HXfHkoSHaa	I read Bible stories aloud while pregnant.  Pray as a family often.  Not just a meal times.  Talk about God and his creation. (birds, clouds, stars,etc..)  Children understand a lot.  My daughter knew the fruits of the spirit by the age of two.  She is now instigating conversations about God to me.    In other aspects of life when a person believes something, she teaches it to her child from day one.  If you view God as a friend and wouldn't you want your child to view him that way as well?  You wouldn't hold off from introducing your mother to your child because you want them to love each other.  Why wait to introduce God to your child when you want them to have a loving relationship as well.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	My son is almost 4 and recites John 3:16 daily.  He also prays before each meal.  He has been doing this for over a year now.  He attends a church daycare and was introduced as an infant.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	We have been introducing our children to God since before they were born.  When I was pregnant with them I'm sure they could hear the hymns through my belly :)    We are just now getting serious about sitting down for a daily short Bible story with our toddler.  He will be 3 years old next month.  I say start right from the beginning.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	From the time she/he is born    You take them to Church  You talk to them about god and heaven from day one    It's a part of live, what you believe    By the time my daughter was two, she knew church, god, heaven, angel|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I would say hat you can introduce a child to your faith from the time their born or from the time you find your faith. You do it by going to your place of worship for services and explaining (in simple terms to start) religious holidays. It can graduate to reading a children's Bible or simplified stories of your faith with and to your child (about when they're ready for reading stories-2-3?) then to reading and discussing the text as they get older. Just remember to keep an open mind when they hit that age that they want and need to question their faith and explore others. Kids sometimes come up with the darnedest questions-answer then honestly and to the best of your knowledge. If you don't have an answer, fess up to that and try to find one.     Good luck!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I say around age 5, start with the basic concepts of God as he exists in the Abrahamic faiths.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	If its a child below 6 years, then show some Christian comics or Christian Bible books for children.    If they are above 6 years old, then you can show the below website.    2 Timothy 3:16  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.    Galatians 1:11-12  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.    2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.    Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.    God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.    The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvationJesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).    The Bible is a part of our History containing actual Historical events .    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|nBMVi9t8aa	im 10 and i knew god when i was 4|`|7SKVCPcSaa	start from the very beginning.  and you go about it by introducing them into the church. reading children bible stories to them. etc. how do you continue to learn about god?  by reading and going to church. same way for you kid.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I would just always teach them, just say prayers with them before bed when they are toddlers and then they will just always know|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	from day 1. At 22 mo my daughter loves to see Jesus (Statues) and crosses. When we are driving she says, Look Mommy, there is a church (any building with a cross!) She says grace at dinner and reads stories about God. We did it right from the beginning, and it is something she has always known.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I agree start from the very beginning the day they are born.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	personally, i think that every child has some (little) innate sense of a higher being.     i went to a catholic preschool from the time i was three, so ive always been around spirituality. I think the best thing to do would be get a childrens bible, or a bible story books, (they even have movies with biblical morals) and introduce them. then let the child ask questions and answer them as they come.     good luck :)  (and i have to say, awesome!)|`|ifSWXqU5aa	Start as early as possible. Always portray God to your children as a loving and caring Father, never use Him as a threat. God Bless.|`|6hrpoVUZaa	When your child is a baby, pray over them. As they grow older, pray with them. And always pray for them:)|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	Unlike everyone else, I am waiting until my son is old enough to understand the concept of God. I want him to decide for himself what his own beliefs are. I will wait until I feel his can understand or if he starts asking me questions. But I feel that by teaching them as soon as they are born you aren't teaching them as much as indoctrinating them. That's how I felt growing up, anyways. I am sure I will get some negatives for that, but it's how I feel.|`|R3Jtm4Wtaa	When they are old enough to decide for themselves if they actually want to believe in your god.    Faith that isn't arrived at through critical thought is worthless anyway.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Easy - start out as an infant - read them bible stories - they make them for toddlers.  You can find bright colored books about Noah's Ark and other biblical figures.  My baby is due in April and we already bought a book from Golden Books about God, it's beautiful and cherishable.  I had one when I was a child and I loved it.    Also, introduce them to a Sunday School class.  Not only will he/she learn about God, but will also make new friends.|`|AA10730513	If you believe in God and / or want your child to grow up knowing that God is real, it is never too early to introduce them to the concept. You can start with things as simple as "I am so lucky that God chose to give me such a wonderful little boy/girl."     You can also send them to Sunday school from like a few weeks old. But I personally wouldn't want to send my kid until 2 or 3 years old. (I did send my daughter a few times when she was a little baby. But she wasn't getting anything from it. ... At 3 though, they get to have fun interacting with other kids and learning sweet songs.)    As they get older, you can use God to answer their endless questions or you can just bring him up out of nowhere. "Why do the birds fly?" "Because God knew that would be the best way for them to get up to their nest, so he gave them wings."     If you don't believe and just want your kid to know what God is so he/she isn't confused when other people talk about the subject - 3 or 4 years old would be a good age. Just come out and tell them "Some people say that God made everything in the world." Answer questions as they come and if they dont' come up often, find a way to work him into the conversation 2 - 4 times a month.
tFvTW9CXaa	AWWW honey, you are so excited! It feels so good to see this! I just got my BFP on 1/27 and I was in shock too, I think I still am a little bit! HAHAHA! A line is a line, don't be afraid to test again (well you really don't have too, but I'm sure you will)...book your Doctor's appointment now and start taking you prenatal vitamins     Congratulations to you!   I know it's hard to keep this news but I would wait.... In the mean time, try to think of some unique ways you can tell them your great news!|`|9drLIXj3aa	Congratulations!!!!!  It sounds like you really are pregnant, I am so happy for you :)|`|ZwG5aAVyaa	congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!  :P  get an appointment with your doctor ASAP.  What else can you do?|`|eEK3m1aXaa	If you really want to be sure, call your doctor and go in for a blood test. Your doctor will be able to confirm whether you are or are not pregnant.   And, tell your husband before your girlfriends. Even if all you're doing is asking your girlfriends for advice, talk to your husband first. He'll be overjoyed!!    Congratulations!      ~_~|`|s519vyP5aa	OMG YOUR PREGO   good luck best wishes yay|`|KHZLPldraa	False positives are very very rare and false negatives happen alot in early stages, so.............. I think CONGRATULATIONS!!!!|`|7iMZ91K7aa	awwww yay!! CONGRATS MOMMY!!! If you got a positive, then your preggers!! Its unlikely to get a false positive... and even if you test again, and its a negative, your still pregnant because you got that one positive!!! yay for you!!!!!!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	AWWWWWWW!!!!!!  You are definitely pregnant dear.  I wouldn't worry about testing again.  I'd go and see either an OB to confirm the pregnancy or visit a clinic and they will write you up a confirmation.  Taking more pregnancy tests can cause a woman to fret and worry more then she should be.  I am SO happy for you.    I think you should take your husband to a sit down restaurant and say you have a present for him.  Wrap the test up in a box and give it to him at the restaurant.  =)|`|FplTPoAyaa	I have heard that there is no such thing as a false positive.  If the lines are dark, I would say, yes, you are pregnant.  I was in the same situation; my husband and I were trying, and I kept taking tests over and over again, and everytime they were negative, I was disappointed.  I had several negative test results when I was actually pregnant; I just wasn't far enough along for a clear result...so, congrats ! It certainly wouldn't hurt to take another to be absolutely sure, or to see your doctor to have him test you.  Good luck !!|`|cypZ0ykXaa	hey! congratulations!! u really r preggy otherwise 2 lines wont show up. think positive now. "good luck sweety" .take care & dont lift heavy weight|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Eat Funyuns.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	A positive is a positive! Retake it and i'm sure you will get another one. Congratulations!    I'm so happy for you! Congrats again!|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	YAY! having a baby will be the best thing you ever do. My test I had a dark line and a lighter one but I'm due here in just a couple days over a week. If they were really dark then no doubt. Don't be afraid to take another, because they'll all say the same thing! You don't get false positives because the chemical that makes a positive only is made in that amount when you're pregnant. and without that chemical the lines are literally impossible to appear positive, only the negative would show.    Congrats on your new bundle of joy! Did you tell hubby yet?|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	YAAAAAAAYYYY!!!    Congrats!

Congrats!!! Most pt test are pretty accurate, the ones you took before prob came out negative because the hormone that detects that your pregnant wasn't enough to show up before, that's happened to me before, sit down and take a deep breath because if it is Truly positive your life is never going to be the same again and you will remember this moment 4ever!|`|jZPv153Jaa	omg thats soooo good now the next step is for you to go to the doctor to make sure u baby is ok :> oh and you can just try textin ur friends im preety sure they will be in shock too. . .and exited.|`|h4UzjZVnaa	Congrats!

AA10949064	My daughter just started her first week of daycare this week (she's only 8 weeks old).  I was really nervous about how she was going to handle it because she was so attached to my hip.  I mean - I couldn't even pee without her screaming because I put her down.  I thought for sure that it was going to be a complete disaster on Monday.  Guess what?  She did amazing and the daycare caregivers absolutely love her.    It's actually harder on the mothers than the kids to start daycare.  You just have to give trust in the caregiver that you chose - knowing that you chose them for a reason.  Like you said, she has been doing this for a very long time.  Same with my daycare.  They have been in business for over 25 years.  My husband and his brother went to them when they were kids if that tells you anything.    Since my daughter has been going to daycare this week, I am finding that her attitude is much better at night time.  I am able to put her down for several hours - she just chills on the couch by herself now.  I think that just in (3) days - daycare has done so much for her.    It's still hard, but I know this will help her immensely.    Good luck!  Trust your decision in knowing that you chose a caregiver that will love and cherish your son like you do.|`|SM4xIodaaa	Your baby sounds like a typical baby- not a high needs baby. If your babysitter has a lot of experience she will know exactly how to handle your child as she has dealt with many children. By accepting your son, she knows what she is getting into and if she could not handle it she would have told you. It is normal to worry.. I did too! I started back to work and my neighbor watches our son. When I drop him off and pick him up he is always happy. That is a good sign to me that he is being taken care of really well. He is just now turning 4 months and has been there 2 months already.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	what daycares do to "train kids" to be more independent is let them cry and ignore them. i have seen it first hand. however, since this a home daycare with not so many kids i think it will be easierr. ask her to make it an easy transition|`|hieQHR0daa	For a start the sitter is very experienced and highly recommended so she must be capable. Having other children to watch and interact with makes life more interesting so that will help your child to settle too.   If you want to know how she is going to deal with your child you really need to ask her.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	my kids were like that too, but daycare has trained them to be a little more independent. They don't let the babies just cry but they do train them to entertain themselves and play with others. I'm a very protective mom so I worried also, I know everything is fine because as soon as the baby sees the daycare workers he smiles big.    Edit: Jillian you are very wrong about daycares, my daycare has a two sided mirror for parents to watch their kids and you are welcome to come at any time of the day to see what your baby is doing, I have had nothing but positve experiences, my two older children are very well adjusted, they are in school now and are doing awesome. They have never once complained about daycare, they loved going and learned new things everyday. Don't judge, its very immature!|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	How is your child 'high needs'? Is he handicapped, disabled, malformed?    At 10 weeks, ALL babies need to be loved and cuddled and that doesn't make them a 'high needs' child, it makes them normal!    If you are comfortable with the services that this person will provide to your child and if you feel she will provide decent care to your baby, and if you have no alternative but to work, then forge ahead.
YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well it could be implantation bleeding but you wouldn't have any pregnancy symptoms before that.
EHY3FnAmaa	Wow I have never heard that before, Ryan is 4 months old better get to pushing him off the bed he only has 8 months.. JK    I dont believe in a lot of those wives tales anyway but thats just me personally.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Well, my son just turned 1 and has never fallen out of bed, thank god.  He's had his share of spills, my hearts had enough of a workout this year, I don't need any more scares.|`|hNzxTWiRaa	I don't know if its true or not but both my kids had fallen out bed before they were a year old.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Never heard of that wives tale but I would rather have bad luck then my baby falling out of bed.|`|HunSyQaSaa	don't believe it. Poor baby. Accidents do happen.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I don't think its true, but i know my daughter fell of the bed before she was a year old.|`|l6bUdWlqaa	Nope, it's not true|`|o2tPN5Geaa	um, no.|`|0QYIbn1saa	no|`|5YTWIfFdaa	its bad luck of the baby DOESNT fall out the bed? id say bad luck if it did fall out the bed. seriously, do you want your baby to fall out their bed? its all rubbish anyways.|`|mUSzHFeWaa	Definitely. You might have to help your baby along a little. Why don't you try to prop one side of the bed up on some phone books. That should work.|`|jrVlzffeaa	I hope it's not true!! lol. I've never heard of that one before Xx|`|d1439023e45a38bfcbe8a9c1fe40deafaa	I never heard of that one, but I did hear a study that proved babies who crawl alot, are better at reading, and want to read more,  as they get older.|`|XOtOMncwaa	yes it's so true, so go ahead and lay your baby on the side of the bed, if you have to give it a little push that might help! ha ha, no seriously I don't think that's true! I would almost consider it bad luck for you baby to fall out of bed before the age of one, although my son has fallen out of bed. I wouldn't worry about it, I'm a big fan of old wives tales, and tend to follow them to a tee, my sons hair didn't get cut until he was a year old, I didn't buy anything until I was 3 months pregnant, and my christmas tree doesn't come down until new years... but that one seems a little crazy!|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	Never heard of it, sounds dangerous.|`|oPRmgyXzaa	i doubt it if thats true|`|6631c5068e2c4c313b1caa78900e6761aa	I don't know ..but this is a very interesting question...almost everyone I know has had a baby fall out of bed...so hmmm|`|JdgEp2X1aa	what?  I never heard that one before. But no, its not true.|`|9d3XJecAaa	they never tend to be true don't worry... I would think it is goodluck.... Gum dosen't stay in your stomach for 10 years when youswallow it either... neither is walking under a ladder bad luck... unless a hammer dropson your head|`|IlfEImbRaa	how superstitious are you?
njLVIp55aa	Very nice and Classy!!!|`|VSCYTZ38aa	It's a lovely name. Very classy.|`|xLabGD6Maa	I love it!  Evelyn Claudia works, too!|`|99Dvcw29aa	very classy =] i think its cute and the names flow well together.|`|AA12318686	It is impressive.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	It's nice|`|JieuhM9eaa	Quite cute :)|`|rDoI0MIraa	Yes its lovely, so cute x|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I really like it! evelyn is one of my favorite names and paired with claudia it sounds very classy!    Thats a good name you've got picked out there! :)|`|Ch23rNeqaa	It's beautiful!!!!!|`|4QSsJ23Caa	The name is nice.|`|TN72hvpEaa	I would drop the 'lyn' in Eve. It sounds a little 'grown up' which will be fine when she's all grown up. What about the first 20 or so years though. Claudia Eve Johnson just sounds better but thats just my opinion! :)   G/l|`|iTOCf9Mzaa	It is a bit posh and is a old fashioned name.    Personally i dont like it xx|`|f1836b65af43f0bbf251d867badf21bbaa	very classic, i love evelyn|`|AA10026200	go for it..|`|VBWfP0Vdaa	Very Nice|`|pbQH9HyCaa	it flows together well
h57t7FAjaa	I like Audrey Meredith & Charlotte Lillian :)  Although I think Charlotte Lillian goes better with your last name.  I Like the name Camille too, but I don't think it goes very well with Nancy.    How about:  Lillian Charlotte Johnson  Audra Rosaline Johnson  Camille Isadora Johnson  Isabella Kathleen Johnson    Like any?    Hope this helps!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	I think Audrey Rosaline sounds pretty;  && Charlotte Lillian is really cute.  I like Isadora & Kathleen, but not together.|`|1OpcR7bZaa	Nadia Rosaline or Isadora Kathleen are the best from the list|`|cdb58ec09082c219d5a820928a9f856aaa	I like Nadia Rosaline|`|qq804CE8aa	They are very pretty names, but the first and middle names just don't go together.|`|fL3SiRDWaa	I really like Charlotte Lillian Johnson  It sounds sophisticated. =]    My friends name is Charlotte but she goes by Char pronounced (shar)   And I thought it was so unique and cool!    Are you having a girl?|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I love the names Audrey Meredith and Charlotte Lillian. So pretty!|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Sounds like grandma names.|`|tWKZVDG2aa	I love Audrey Meredith Johnson, but it is quite a long name.  What about   Audrey Celia Johnson  Audrey Violet Johnson   Audrey Lilah Johnson   Audrey Kate Johnson    If no I do still really like Audrey Meredith.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	I think they all sound nice. Charlotte Lillian Johnson is my favorite.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	I'm not a fan of Camille Nancy as it has no flow to it.  I like the others but adore Charlotte Lillian :)|`|nkM6wmv6aa	I LOVE your taste in names! I don't particularly like Nadia, Lillian or Kathleen, but the rest are all SO lovely!!    Audrey Meredith is so classy and sophisticated, but also really cute for a little girl and cool (much better than any wannabe trendy names, this is the name that people will meet and say 'cool name') for a teenager.  Camille is such a pretty French name I love it, and Nancy is one of my personal favourites! I wouldn't put them together though this way round - is my only suggestion, they don't seem to flow so well. I like Nancy as a first name! It's technically short for plain old Ann, but you could expand on that to make it short for Annabelle, or Anastasia!  Nadia I don't like much personally but there's nothing actually wrong with it, just personal opinion. Rosaline is pretty though. I prefer Rosalie?  Charlotte is lovely and classic, suits all ages.   Isadora is adorable! So many nicknames from this as well. I picture such a beautiful girl with this name!!    My favourite combinations would be Isadora Charlotte, Anastasia Camille (Nancy for short), or Audrey Meredith.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	Name her Camille its after your mom and has a great meaning|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Audrey Meredith is not my style.    Camille Nancy don't appear to flow very well. I love Camille as a first name though.    Nadia Rosaline sounds cute.    Charlotte Lillian is cute. Lillian Charlotte is beautiful also.    Isadora Kathleen is not my style|`|o7hHmqfaaa	I Like CHarlotte Lillian =]|`|pTVxGebbaa	3rd ones the best|`|CutNmrlWaa	Audrey Meredith: No  Camille Nancy: i like it minus the nancy  Nadia Rosaline: no  Charlotte Lillian: YES!  Isadora Kathleen: no|`|sgmv6AXnaa	Audrey Meredith souds nice!|`|3bApbb2yaa	I like Charlotte Lillian, but I would change the first name to Jaycee|`|w5y4BTjkaa	I like Audrey Meredith and Charlotte Lillian. They're both beautiful names and they are not common. You could make a lot of nicknames off of Charlotte, Lillian, and Meredith, and that's really good. I really think they flow well, too. It doesn't sound like a mouthful when you say the full name. Camille Nancy is nice too, but I really think Audrey Meredith and Charlotte Lillian are even prettier and more unique. Great name choices! And I hope I've helped!     Always,  (-:Tabbykinz:-)|`|Zrz9KHISaa	how about Jordan Nancy too cute  or  Adrianna Camille|`|KYyP8Dtraa	I love Charlotte Lillian and Audrey Meredith!    They are classy!    Good luck and hope I helped =)|`|RwRCwJXMaa	Nadia Rosaline Johnson sound better than the rest if u ask me but its really up to what you like and what means the most to you.|`|Y6tSmRYeaa	I like Charlotte Lillian and Audrey Meredith.|`|xwbnnY4Yaa	Im going to go ahead and mix them up a little. Just a few suggestions.    Audrey Kathleen  Meredith Camille  Nadia Isadora  Lillian Camille  Charlotte Rosaline    Happy naming and God bless!|`|0b9cd0c215da9ba41c5fbca675289e28aa	Audrey Meredith Johnson - I like this a lot.  The name Audrey is just so pretty and classic.  Meredith as a middle name goes perfectly.    Camille Nancy Johnson - I'm not crazy about the name Nancy, it doesn't flow as well as your other picks.  But the fact that this name is after your mother makes it very sweet.  And I still think its a pretty name.    Nadia Rosaline Johnson - Also pretty, though I'm not the biggest fan of the name Nadia.    Charlotte Lillian Johnson - I don't like the name Lillian, and I think her whole name is a mouthful.  I would consider Charlotte Lily, I think that would be very pretty.    Isadora Kathleen Johnson - Love Isadora, its very glamourous and classic--but unusual.  I think Kathleen has too many syllables for the first and last names, it's also a mouthful, and I don't think Isadora and Kathleen go together.  Other ideas:    Isadora Lee Johnson  Isadora Camille Johnson (same amount of syllables, but it flows quicker and better)  Isadora Rose Johnson  Isadora Mere Johnson    Good luck!|`|6GOhTIXNaa	Those are all beautiful!! I love Audrey, especially.|`|dYYD4ibGaa	they all suck.|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	I like all of them.  I think keeping Nancy as a middle name no matter what you chose asa first name is a really nice way of honoring your mom.    Camille Nancy is pretty.    I also like  Meredith Nancy  Nadia Nancy  Rosaline Nancy  Charlotte Nancy  Lillian Nancy  Isadora Nancy  Kathleen Nancy    Good Luck with your choice.|`|ZPIKhstmaa	Wow that's really uncanny, my grandma is called Audrey and I have the same last name. I have to vote for Camille (minus the Nancy part) as that's my first name too. I have to admit I hated my name when I was younger but I can't be introduced to somebody without them commenting on what a pretty or lovely name it is! Nancy doesn't seem to flow well with it however as it's a bit too harsh for the name Camille. I have Louise as a middle name and the L's at the end of Camille flow beautifully with the first L of Louise, so you could just use my name if you wanted to I wouldn't mind! :D|`|uZt2eLUqaa	Charlotte Lillian!|`|FHRfTlCxaa	I really love Nadia and Charlotte.. :)|`|NzFPFqaCaa	Audrey Meredith Johnson is a good name.|`|UDnzvjCeaa	I think you need to get another book of baby names.|`|Wnmg850Paa	My favs are Nadia Rosaline (middle name is pretty) & Isadora|`|1xBefTTLaa	i like Charlotte Lillian|`|Nn24lJW6aa	i like audrey meredith and nadia rosaline best.|`|def8d0f4bf1d91c672963244bee3b543aa	I like Isadora. It's uncommon and that's cool i should know lol|`|bw00QLP7aa	Not my taste, sorry.
9TfKeq9Eaa	I didn't feel my baby move until I was around 19 weeks. I wouldn't worry. Most first time moms take longer to recognize the feeling of fetal movement.|`|AA10186411	Carrying extra weight can definitely make it take longer to feel.  Also, the position of the placenta. Sometimes it can be in a position where the baby kicks it, and you don't feel it.  Thats why you hear of women who never knew they were pregnant.  The little things they did feel they thought were gas! lol  But no need to worry.  If it gets to be 22 weeks and you still haven't, then I would start to worry a little, but as long as she is moving about on the ultrasound everything is fine!  Congrats on the baby, I'm sure everything will be fine!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	your placenta may be attached to the front of your uterus making it harder to feel the baby right now.    thats how mine is and i didn't feel my son move until week 22. had 2 ultrasounds to find out what he was (one for the doc and one for fun!) and saw him moving and everything. couldn't feel a thing though! lol.    so don't worry until at least week 23.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I felt my baby move around 19 weeks.  dont worry youll get there.    its normal to be worried, every woman is.  being pregnant is like 9 months of standing on edge.|`|mxixfE3Raa	Well your baby will start moving at 16 weeks, which is called quickening, but if this is your first baby, you probably won't notice anything from 18-22 weeks, so if you're 18 weeks then that's fine, you will feel your baby any time soon!  Remember if you do start to feel your baby, and then you feel as though you don't feel anything for days, then that's fine, and don't worry, because around this time your baby is still relatively small. Your baby is now very aware of outside movements, so sudden loud noises outside your body etc. will probably be when you feel your baby most.  I felt my first at about 19 weeks.    Good Luck x|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I wouldn't worry at all. My sister (who is skinny skinny skinny) felt her baby move at about 17 weeks and I (who am average) felt it move at about 19 weeks. I never felt the flutters like they talk about, I was simply sitting in bed with my hand on my tummy and it kicked, then I didn't feel it again for about a week. Your extra weight could be a cushion between the baby and your hand. I wouldn't worry, like they say, everybody is different.|`|AA11795652	I'm a plus-size girl but I don't carry the weight in my mid-section but with my first I didn't feel movement until 18 weeks but it still took two weeks to realize that it was the baby moving and not just gas.  It felt like popcorn popping in my belly or like butterflies fluttering at first.  No need to worry at all.  Also, if you're busy and on the go, you are probably rocking your baby to sleep with your movement and when you are sleeping is probably when your baby is moving.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	I felt "quickening" at 15 weeks & actual kicks at 18 weeks. But im a small girl. If your are over weight you might not feel your baby til later (20+ weeks). Thats what my DR told me. But as long as your baby has a heartbeat & your midwife isnt worried then you should be fine.|`|96ydDKocaa	no need to worry some times you just don't recognize what your feeling at first some women say it feels like bubbles, flutters, gas, dont worry im sure youll feel them as the baby gets a little bigger i was a worrier also theres a great baby heart beat listener on the market company is bebe i got mine @ babies r us for 25 its so cool to hear the baby's heart beat when you want..|`|ApHLa19Faa	This is perfectly normal. I started feeling "flutters" at around 17-18 weeks, but I wasn't even sure if it was the baby or just gas. It wasn't until 19-20 weeks that I started being more sure that it was the baby. When I had my 20-week scan, she was moving all over the place - the tech even had a hard time getting some of the measurements because she wouldn't stay still - and I could barely feel any of it! I'm 22 weeks, 3 days now and I feel her pretty regularly, though it's not consistent at all.|`|xxMKaJCBaa	I'm 20 weeks today and I haven't felt anything yet, I went to see my consultant yesterday and she told me not to worry I will start to feel movement in the next few weeks. She checked my blood pressure and listened to the heartbeat and everything is prefect so I'm just waiting now. Good luck and you feel something soon x
PA5iBQZAaa	i cant even begin to say how  sorry iam  for what you went through but i am sorry i can see why you might be a little stressed but with the help of a good doctor he will watch you very closely take it super easy and always rely on God hes gonna take care of you just cast your worries and fears upon him good luck and God Bless|`|S1gJJHNzaa	congrats and God bless!|`|o8xNTVWTaa	every pregnancy is different. bc something happened once doesn't mean at all it will happen Again ... and stressing ur self out as always isn't good for u or the baby... just take care of ur self enjoy ur new exciting news  congrats on ur BFP
TAufQoc7aa	Hey there!    I think its lovely    I think I'd spell it Gianna. I think it looks lovely spelt like that    Thanks for introducing this name to me!    x|`|odEAUvHDaa	Well I know someone names Deanna and she says it "DEEH-NA" and someone else who pronounces it "DE-ANNA." Well, I don't really know which one you are referring to, but in my opinion both is BAD. Why not just do Jenna?|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I don't like it.    Joanna?|`|FK8gNlx0aa	if its pronounced the same way as Deanna, i think thats how you should spell it. its beautiful and unique, but not too unusual-sounding.    hope i helped =]|`|Ch23rNeqaa	Is different but not ridiculous!  But it's to big.. don't you think?  =*|`|kCiizn5oaa	Its ok but I think Jenna is a pretty alternative.|`|rDoI0MIraa	Yea its nice, but i agree with some of the others Joanna or Jenna are better, but its your choice, good luck x
LoP2CRE2aa	I like them! I have recently become a fan of the name Allison. I used to think it was quite common but now days it really isn't! Lindley is also very cute.    Noah is a great, classic guys name and goes well with Mason.    I like your kids names! :)|`|AA11210211	I like them I LOVE Mason very unique:)|`|EevMUAqJaa	Love it! My boyfriend wants to name a son Noah.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	I actually got Noah from The Young and The Restless - NOT the notebook. I guess you younger kids probably dont watch Y&R tho...     Anyway, I like the names you picked. nice|`|7d8b092b0508a647a38976703a57cc4faa	my name is noah too  and people keep bothering me with the notebook thingy  because there are not much noahs out there  i love your kids name :)  ps: fan of the movie.|`|viwq8ldvaa	Very modern but classic names, I must say. Good choices, good names !! My daughter is Lillian Eve.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Noah & Ally (too cute)|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	My soon to be baby will be named   Dominica Janae|`|99Dvcw29aa	cute. classy but still modern =]|`|0uhRgfcsaa	awh. my daughters name is allison :) so i better like that one. noah mason is also adorable.|`|2owaSpf0aa	I quite like them. I prefer Alice to Allison, I find it more pretty and feminine, but the nickname Allie is cute.    I have two sons, Ethan James and Harry Seth, we're welcoming number 3 soon. If she is a girl, her name will either be Callie Rose or *insert Rose variant* Kate. If he is a boy, his name will be either Alec Dean, Jacob Dean or Marcus Dean.|`|9CAXUgOZaa	I think it's totally cute that their names are like the characters from The Notebook. (even if it was unintentional)    I actually really do not like the name Allison, but I LOVE Allie.    And Noah Mason is adorable :)|`|57X92zknaa	Haha, one of my closest friends is Noah Mason! It's his whole name, he doesn't have a middle name. I really like them as first and middle name, really cool!    Allison Lindley I'm not a big fan of, and I don't like Allie very much.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like them.    I adopted my kids but their names are evan Michael and david justin.|`|NJU2XWu8aa	what are you going to do if we hate them? change them?|`|OIDJKOM4aa	Did you actually name them after the notebook?    sad sad|`|oWKOlJyjaa	I like that. I think I'll name my kids Jack and Sally.|`|jwIdq5qkaa	Oh I love the Notebook! And the names are adorable!    I don't have any yet but we have started writing names down they we like and so far our favorites would have to be Brooklyn(my grandpas 1st name aunt with cancer middle name) , Bristol, Alyson Diana (After my mom Alice and his moms middle name)    Boys we like Hunter, Mason, and Walker (after the texas ranger because we always watch it every night and when we first started dating)|`|Ho4xK8DDaa	I like all of you names.  Noah, Mason, and Allison are all really pretty and all sound great.|`|Tfd0z5Xhaa	i love those names,  my kids are called   Jordan Joshua  Cydonie Cameron  Jessica Lauren|`|LIJ6Ti4yaa	change them....|`|8mchLCQhaa	My sons name is Bradly David.
EHY3FnAmaa	I had to have the social security number.  maybe call the social security office and ask over the phone for the number or you can go into your local office and get a card printed.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	you have to wait for that number before you can fully file.  why dont you just go down to the social security office they can give you the number ?|`|cj7sSPZEaa	If you had the baby in 2009 you can not claim for 2008.  If she was born in 2008, then you should wait until her SS card comes in the mail.  They won't let you claim without a number.|`|iOI2RT6maa	You cannot claim a baby you had this year on last years taxes.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	you cant claim her this year|`|9kPPmazoaa	Well you have time to file your taxes. I know that you probably want to file now. But if you go the SS office and apply for a SS card it should take no time at all for you to get it. We went through the SS office for our daughters card instead of the hospital, because we heard it was quicker. And it was!!! It only took one week for us to get her card.|`|OZ474DMYaa	well you have till April 15th, you can always wait for her s.s.   and do it right then when it comes. just a thought. good luck.    also you can only claim the baby if you had the baby last year. if you had the baby this year then you have to wait till next year to claim him/her.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	No - wait until the baby's SSN arrives - otherwise your return will be rejected.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	If you contact the SS office, they can give you the number.  I'm assuming that you had this baby at the very end of 2008 since you don't have the ss card yet.  I would call a tax service maybe and just ask if you can leave it blank since the DOB is so near the end of 2008.|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	I believe the child needs to be over 6 months old to claim, although not positive.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	You can't claim the child if they were born after December 31 2008. You will have to wait until next year.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	If you had the baby after January 1st, you can't claim her this year.  You are filing 2008 taxes currently, so if she is a 2009 baby, they will not let you claim her, with or without SS  .
e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	Ignoring price I'd say Macy's and BabyGap.  They have the cutest stuff!  I've only bought a couple items there, though, because it's so expensive.  Most of the baby clothes I've bought have been from Target and Old Navy because they are way cheaper.  Though, I've shopped from Old Navy.com to get a lot because they have a much better selection than in the store.    At Macy's though, I bought the cutest little leather jacket, jeans, and red button-up shirt outfit.  It was on sale for $30, so that's not bad.  It's a 9 month size, so whenever he fits into it (we're thinking he'll be a big baby) that'll be an outfit for him to get his picture taken in.      At BabyGap we bought him a newborn size Superman onsie.  So cute!|`|fHjSonssaa	Gymboree has REALLY cute stuff- it can be pricey- but I love all the themese they come up with.    Jack and Janie (or maybe it's Janie and Jack)- really cute for both sexes.    Gap has cute stuff for boys-    Old Navy actually ends up having really cute stuff for boys- but I find that it's hit or miss.  I always check them out though becasue the prices are so reasonable.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Target has the cutest boy clothes, it's so irritating that there are so many more girls clothes than boys.|`|a3TZ7hFTaa	Children's place and Disney Store are my favourites!! I also have a baby boy! Congrats!!|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i think that mother-care & Next are good brands for buying clothes for baby boys..but i think that you can go to some normal shops as sometimes you get a very good & rare collection over there which named brands don't have & if they have they are too costly..!!    hope this helps you..!!|`|giKCTfnfaa	i agree.  i had 2 boys and i would always wander over to the girls section and wonder why the boys clothes weren't as cute.    my cousin has a baby that's now 5 months old.  i buy his clothes at target and kohls.  they are decently priced (especially kohls when they have sales going on) and soooo much cuter than when my kids were babies!    children's place has really cute clothes too but can be pricey.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Target|`|ylCcuUDSaa	I found some cute stuff at Old Navy
0VHolTVEaa	Try having a warm bath at night followed by a warm cup of milk this will really help you sleep.Try to get as much sleep now before the baby comes. You can buy special matresses designed for pregnant women to sleep so that may be worth a try. Also try putting a pillow between your legs and behind yr back when your on your side. Good luck|`|NPmRmnG6aa	Oh I feel your pain. I am 26 weeks I will be 27 tomorrow. Sleeping sucks. I wake up with a stiff right hip, and all through out the night. I toss and turn all night long. I got a body pillow this week and it has helped a little my hips don't hurt as bad and I am able to sleep on my left side (the baby is on my left side and she kicks me so hard when I lay on my left). To top it off I am starting to get a cold, I am so congested that I can't breath out of my nose and I have a sore throat. I woke up at 5 a.m. and I filled up the Humidifier and that helped a little. I am not working and when my husband gets up in the morning so do I, and I use to be able to fall right back asleep now I can't.  I am up all day long, no matter how tired I am. I can't even nap anymore.|`|MtC3CWZraa	There's nothing you can do. I've had bouts of insomnia durring most of my pregnancy. It only tends to get worse as time goes on.     Plenty of couples end up sleeping in different rooms once the sleep troubles start. After about 32 weeks, I moved into our guest room where I have 7 pillows plus my body pillow and the freedom to arrange them however I need to.     I nap durring the day on the weekends. If you don't work, nap whenever you can.    Just think of it as your body prepping you for what you'll be dealing with once the baby comes.|`|AA12064250	Ahhh, the joys of pregnancy!  This is my 3rd and I have experienced this for the first time.  I am in the same position as you are.  If you like me, it will only get worse.  I am now just over 37wks and have to roll over every 45 minuted or my hips kill me.  Body pillow doesnt not work for me either.  I have yet to find a resolution.  Hopefully we can both get some answers!!  Good luck!!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I've been doing the same thing for a few weeks now. I have to completely wake up just to roll over, then because I'm awake I have to pee. It sucks!|`|wBpennsMaa	I started getting hip soreness when I was in your month as well and it was when I woke up to switch sides at night. It sucks because at that point I could only sleep on my sides, my tum was big and sleeping on my back resulted in me having a very hard time breathing due to my uterus being large enough to push on major blood flow. The hip soreness is from the ligaments in our hips stretching and from the cartilage being softer. Putting a pillow in between your legs at night helps.|`|4QSsJ23Caa	lol i had the same problem i would get horrible cramps in my legs that woke me up. I had pilllows all around me , i even started sleeping on top of pillows and it helped.|`|H2ciLJoPaa	I've been waking up to turn over many times a night for a while now too (I'm 32 weeks). I've ditched my body pillow after trying 2 different ones. Instead I use one under my head, one between my knees, one to hug, and most importantly a really squishy pillow under my tummy. I don't know why but 4 pillows seems to work better for me than using a body pillow. but of course when it comes time to turn over that's 4 pillows you have to take with you and readjust...|`|qMI6H6Lbaa	i have had trouble sleeping from the start i cant get comfortable i get heart burn if if sleep certain ways and i am always so tired but just cant seam to sleep .
q7HvkRpyaa	They usually just put some gel stuff on their finger and poke their finger around in there. They don't use any instruments or anything. Since dilation is usually determined by finger widths.|`|28fNd725aa	No they just stick their fingers in just like they do during a pap and maybe push your belly down a little... might be a little uncomfortable again similar to a pap.....     Good luck hope you've made some progress!!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	They just stick in some fingers because they judge by how many fingers they can get through your cervix.|`|Lj8wZiLuaa	he will do it "manually".. lol with his fingers. It is kinda painful the first time they do it, not to scare you.. its just pretty uncomfortable.  Don't expect anything to happen tho.. some women don't dilate at all.. or you might have some good progress.  since its your first baby, I wouldn't expect a whole lot.|`|R4UvK4Haaa	no just fingers.. it dont hurt to bad(well it didnt for me) keep ur head up ur almost to the end! =]
miPubuDYaa	Your gf had another baby and your parents didnt know about it? How did you let that happen? Even though you are young that is thier grandkid too.    Anything that your parents say are just words. If they say you don't derves sex. It doesn't mean nothing. Its just that they are mad and is nonesense. They can't prevent you from having sex. I would be moire worried if they throw you out of thier home.    Worry about you child(ren) and your gf. Don't worry so much about sex. Sex isn't everything!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	I'm not sure I entirely understand your question. If your parents are mad or make nasty comments tell them that they can either be there & support you, or they don't have to. but nothing is going to change your mind on the baby. But you'd rather have them there so that th eir grandchild can know its grandparents.  good luck|`|fE5zMOfJaa	Who cares if they make comments!!!  You just need to take care of your baby & fiance!  They are the most important thing in your life right now!  Your parents will get over it!  And if they don't...o well!  They are the ones missing out!

e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	It's very easy to get dehydrated in pregnancy.  You have to drink even more water when pregnant than before.  Also, your iron could be low depending on how far along you are (the farther along, the higher the chance of anemia).  Talk to your doctor.  She can do a simple blood test in the office to find out if you are anemic.  Also, talk to her about how you have to stand a lot.  That's not very good either.  Pregnant women aren't supposed to stand for long periods of time.  You may have to go on early maternity leave.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	drink lots of water. rest when you can. dehydration is dangerous for you AND the baby so drink more water. Appetite comes and goes during pregnancy-you just get used to it. But you sound dehydrated. And I know I've said it twice already but DRINK MORE WATER    good luck!|`|8DnIXwnyaa	dehydration is a major cause of preterm labor.  they told me to drink 1 gallon is a 24 hour period.  It is very difficult.  Good luck.|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	Water....Water...Water...that's all I can say. Drink plenty of water.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	drink lots of water|`|9iXGakohaa	Bring a giant water bottle with you to work! You need to get at least 8 glasses of water a day as well as a quart of milk a day so that you can feel good and your baby can come out healthy!|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	drink lots if water.take a bottle of water with you to work.i know it makes you go to the bath room allot,but it's good for you're body & the baby.  good luck.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You need to stay hydrated because dehydration can cause preterm labor.|`|PmrC7zxYaa	i've been feeling the same way for the past wk..but only the dry mouth & throat..just try & keep yourself active & drink LOTS of water!!
mx3gFmIKaa	Yes I have a babee tenda crib.  Putting it together takes a few hours, the pieces are heavy because its solid wood.  I am not real handy but we didn't have trouble with the directions.  Yes its a good crib.
DKqsFGymaa	It's very normal, but of course you still have to try and break the habit.    If you can tell when she's having a BM, try having her sit on the toilet with her pull-up still up.  She apparently has developed some sort of fear of doing it on the toilet so maybe that will ease her into it again.    After she has her BM, the two of you should flush it down the toilet together to try and break the fear.    Good luck!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Yes?   It's called anal retentive, as opposed to anal expulsive...   Add some more fiber the days leading to her visits and ask her dad to give her some "quiet alone time" every day when she usually has a b.m..   My kids hold it on the weekends because their dad is home all day and they get to do different things and then Monday is pooping day, all day long (lucky me), I know adults who don't have b.m.s when on trips or holidays - same thing.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	ok I'm going to get a little personal here, but as none of you know me (gotta love the anynomity of the internet) I feel comfortable discussing this. You and your child are not alone and are not the only ones. It had turned out that the nerve in my body that tells you when you need to make a bm hadn't fully developed when I was born. So, I did not feel when I had to make a bm until it got pretty backed up in there. What happened was one day when I was about 4 or 5 I did a huge one and it hurt a lot. I have very low pain tolerance so after that I had made up my mind to stop doing bm. That got me into trouble cause I kept holding it in and holding it in until the very last possible second and i wouldn't be able to make it to the toilet and went in my underwear. I did this for a long while too. My parents took me to the doctor (this is when we found out about my nerve not being fully developed) He gave them suggestions like prunes I had to have prune juice once a week. And when things got particularly difficult they did something that I called 'the thing' I wish I could remember the name of the product but I was very little. It was a bottle full of water?? I think that they would put up me and squeeze it would soften the bm in there and allow me to get it out easier.|`|oojO4WAraa	I'd leave her in her poopy diaper until she was uncomfortable enough to realize she needs to go to the bathroom like a big girl.|`|5yZxxeyPaa	Poor little thing. Nothing is surprising when it comes to little kids.  Does the doctor know about the holding it all weekend and the pull ups?  It could be an indication of something being wrong in her life.  Could be stress?    But if you are sure everything is ok in her life, just give her some time. She is still relatively young.  My 7 year old won't BM at school or in public. The only difference is the pull up.    Sounds like you are being reassuring and loving, which will help her in the long run. Lots of love and don't make a big deal about the pull ups.  The less interesting they are, the better.  Maybe somehow get her to just sit on the potty with the pull up on, to get the feel of it. Then add some fun books and other small toys to hold there...she will get interested!    Good Luck!  Hang in there!|`|ReH5EoR0aa	Try getting a smaller child size toilet.      Maybe something about the big one is preventing her from relaxing enough.    My sons refused to toilet train at all til they were 4 years old - I could hardly believe it.  (Each one, too)   It got to where they would go fetch the diaper (didn't have pull ups then) and the wipes, and practically change their own diaper in front of me.    Then all of a sudden, they decided.     One was a bed wetter til age 6.       That stuff happens when they are getting things figured out.   I wouldn't worry too much, though holding for 8 days is a long time.   Try giving her foods and snacks that help that along.   Grapes, dates, etc.|`|13cc03f46e318a1a2bae06264512cbc6aa	I read your question over and over again.  I think you need to talk to her about her falling in.  You are going to have to get every detail and listen.  Was she by herself or with someone when this happened?  How did she feel?  Falling in the toilet while doing a poo would be devastating for anybody.  She has to talk more about it.  Her two year old fear is not the same smarter fear that she would feel now.  For instance if the toilet was flushed she would definitely not fit down it.  Second who ever laughed before was a jerk and she should be told so.  Her privates went in toilet water and it was cold.  I Think if you could get her to talk more about the toilet incident even in great length and her emotions about it that would be a start.  Even get a large doll and have her pretend its her and see if she can get the doll to use the toilet.  Listen to the things that she would tell the doll.  Also offer to install temporary handles near the toilet so that she could have more to hang on to if she wants to try again.  If she has a female cousin or sister the same age maybe she could be present to see their method or help mentor a younger sibling.|`|t1OSx5VOaa	Yes, I've heard of this. It sounds like she's scared of the toilet.    One solution is to try to move gradually from the pull up.  Don't pressure her, because that might make it worse, you are aiming for her to relax, and lase her fear.  For example, put the pull up into a potty, and have her do it on, rather than in, the pull up.  If that works, cut the pull up in half.  Gradually do this until you can put a little bit of pull up (or TP) into the toilet.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	Honestly, I'd consult her doctor, and see if you can perhaps get referred to a specialist. This isn't normal (well it might happen to other kids, but that doesn't make it normal) and going 8 days without a bowel movement for any person, especially a child is DANGEROUS.     I think this is probably psychological, but it is an will cause serious physical damage to the point where she will become incontinent unless you work with her daily to fix this.    Until you speak with her doctor again, I would have her sit with you holding her arms on the toilet when she has to go. (Squat in front of her while she is on the toilet, and hold her and console her) Just for small amounts of time, 30 seconds maybe (count to thirty with her). Then, once she has done that, let her go in the pull up. Once she can do that without too much complaining, I'd move up to 45 seconds. Keep moving up from there slowly, going up every couple days until she's sitting on the toilet for 5 minutes at a time.  Tell her she is safe on the toilet, and while you are with her nothing will happen. Make sure her father follows the same routine. If he is not willing to, perhaps visitation needs to be shortened until this matter is taken care of.|`|2d8879147618190440919438922e8a7eaa	my daughter was like this.  she would pee int he toilet all you wanted her to but would not do number two.  so, what we did is i asked my daughter what is something that she wanted more than anything in the whole wide world.  as long as it is resonable, tell her you will get her that if she makes number two in the toilet.  she is also old enough to tell you why she holds it in.  it may hurt her which is what was gong on with my daughter and she would get scared, so make her understand that it is ok to poo and to do it int he toilet.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	I suggest you take a tip from Ruthie's story - when she's been witholding for a long time, give her an enema.  And let her know you'll be repeating the procedure every time she specifically fails to do the doo ON THE TOILET for 5 days.    It might be just what she needs to make her wise up and take charge of her bowel movements.
H74F8jxuaa	Not necessarily.  You could have tested early.  Wait until you miss your period.
9TfKeq9Eaa	I would talk to your doctor and tell him you need some kind of note for school. Take your note to the office or whoever is in charge of school attendance. Obviously they will understand the circumstances. Ask your doctor when he thinks is a good time for you to stop going to school. Probably around 38 or 39 weeks. I'm sure you can set up some kind of system to get work to do at home until you return to school. Maybe talk to your teachers about this or your guidance counselor. I think most girls stay out about 6 weeks, but it really depends on your circumstances. Good luck!|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I wouldn't take off until I go into labor. Let the school know when you are due and how long you will be off. They may have paperwork.     You could go to 42 weeks, you don't want to take too much time off, you'll have a lot to make up if you do.    Has the doctor checked you yet? Are you dilated,effaced?|`|XE45S6OTaa	Since it is your first pregnancy, I would go as long as I could.  That way, you wont have as much to catch up on once the baby is born.  I would stay to 39 weeks.  If you are at home waiting, you`ll get bored and anxious too.  Granted everything is ready at home, and your bag is packed and you have a way to the hospital from school if something were to start, then stay till at least then    That is just my suggestion.  You`ll be off for a while when it is born so it just seems better to do the work now.  I would even see if they can give you work to work a head on so you can spend most of your time with the baby when it is born|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Don't take off until you actually go into labor.|`|9c9kZePHaa	Are you in high school, or college?    I would take a week and a half to two weeks off, just to be safe. See if there's any work you could do at home and then turn back in. You cannot just jump back into school after having a baby, so you need to get some work set up tht you can complete at home. Best of luck, and have a happy, healthy baby! By the way, I'd talk to your doc and see what he/she says, and see if they can write a note for your school.|`|1da22694eee1f6055b5ea295d06bcf40aa	I wouldn't take off early. You never know when this baby can come so stick it out as long as possible. You could take off early and just be sitting on your butt.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Go until you're in labor. That's what I'm doing with my job.     As for what your school needs from you, speak to the office.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I would take off at 38 weeks but if it is your first baby then probably 39 weeks.|`|nuT4GDTEaa	Your Dr knows best|`|KncPJwIaaa	get your work from the teachers and take off friday|`|lFlapW8maa	until your water breaks,  have you considered being induced.  so you know when it will happen.
G5Ut9prSaa	Sweetie, you have PUPPS. At 37 weeks there isn't much your doctor will do for you other than induce you if it gets too bad. My sister-in-law had that. She used Aloe (use the white stuff not the green). It'll have a burning tingly sensation when you first put it on, but will help!|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	It could be just dry/chaffed skin. Apply a good lotion or vaseline & if it doesnt get better in a day or so ask your DR about it.

8051f43b2bc719ecc6bce44edb91221baa	Very close.  Anything above 3 cm. is generally active labor.  I'd be shocked if you didn't have the baby within a couple of days.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Yes sounds like your in labour, are u getting pains/contractions? I think anyday now u will have your beautiful baby in your arms. Congrats|`|AA12064250	Great question!!  I was 36wks, dilated 1cm and the doctor could laready feel the baby's head was engaged.  Here I am 37wks and still no baby.  Contracting non stop but have been told its just braxton hicks...ARGH!  These last few weeks are terrible!!  Best of luck to you!!|`|4QSsJ23Caa	You could be. i was 3 cm dilated for about 24 hrs then finally they had to break my water and about 5 min later i went into labor.|`|gBDNbzJ2aa	Dont cross your legs! could be dangerous.. no joke. go to the doctor now, im surprised  your not feeling like you should push?  go now     36 weeks and 6 days pregnant!|`|ZlxQ1lNPaa	Yes, I would say you are in th early stages of labor. Didn't your Dr. tell you that? I'm a mom of 5 and that's labor to me.
C55pji5Qaa	At 14dpo my HCG was 261 and 16dpo it was 681. My doctor told me that HCG was not a good indicator of twins and that Progesterone levels are a better indicator. My best friends had a higher first beta than me with her singleton and yes I am having twins. Her embryo may have implanted sooner. 70.6 is in normal range!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	No, that does not indicate twins.  That's a normal number for having conceived around Jan.25.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	it is supposed to go up quickly, if it goes up too slowly it can be a sign of possible miscarriage.  hcg doesnt give any info in regards to multiple births.|`|7fb7e659a2d89fef1b835dc202b88053aa	hcg absolutely has something to do with twins! normally hcg rates double every 24-48 hours, something like that. well, with my twins they more than tripled and the doctors and nurses thought it indicative of twins and they were right! now that said, i'm not a professional regarding this, but it doesn't seem right now to mean twins to me....just that you are pregnant and to to that- i say congrats!|`|YhjFiVGyaa	yes, in twin pregnancies, the hcg levels are double that of a single. but some women do spike up flast, as some dont. It can take a woman 10 dpo to get a full positive while others wont see a positive until after they miss a period. and hcg levels double every day.
2f8a23ec2f29b7722c5aa5a1d49381e6aa	the only reason it would possibly be even slightly true is that getting up and walking around makes gravity work against the little guys trying to get to the egg. it has nothing to do with actually peeing. if you really have to pee, i would just try waiting for a little while to give the sperm longer to get farther!|`|o8xNTVWTaa	i have heard that to but i am thinking its false information|`|39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	No, it's not true. The pee comes out of a different hole entirely and all the swimmers have already been forced up there.|`|E1ppYqCtaa	HAAAAAAAAAA! who ever told you that needs to get punched in the neck. I pee all the time after sex and I have 3 kids!! But hey it might work for some. Not likely .|`|422baec93c2e09175c8e2ab1b0c51d3baa	uhhh, FALSE.
0VHolTVEaa	Sometimes you miss a period due to stress but you could also be pregnant. Try testing again in a week and that will give u a more clear result. If not visit yr doctor
kv8ZFPP1aa	you should be feeling kicks at this stage, but if you're not then maybe he is moving at night when you're sleeping. if you have any concerns then you should call your dr and let him know about the movements.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	He moves at night because you don't.  When you're awake during the day and active, your movements relax him and he spends much of the day sleeping.  When you're not moving, he doesn't have that movement, or rocking, to lull him to sleep.  At 7 months, it's getting to be cramped quarters for him, and will continue to have less room to move around as your dd draws closer.  Less movement is fine, as long as he's moving everyday.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I'm not sure if this is normal, but my son was the same way. Almost nobody got to feel him kick through the entire pregnancy. My husband felt him a few times because he would move the most right before bed. When I was farther along I could find a lump (foot, elbow?) and if I pushed on it he would move a bit. He was born full-term and completely healthy. I would say as long as his heart rate and size are normal at your dr appts, then you have nothing to worry about.|`|TWW5DGttaa	I've never been pregnant but I thought I would throw my two cents in and say when my mom was pregnant with me I only kicked one time the entire nine months and that was because they gave her orange juice to make me move. Needless to say, I was a very calm child who had the opposite of ADD (disipline) and a more serious minded young adult.|`|O5WberWnaa	im 30wks 2moro and i was paniking yesterday because i didnt hardly feel her moving around,that was because i was doing all my housework and i was rocking her so she was quiet.lol  the moment i led down in bed she thought it was time to kick around.  thats the best time i find to feel my baby moving around.  you should keep a record of 10kicks a day x|`|0VHolTVEaa	Its normal, firstly its getting cramped for baby so doesnt have so much room to move, also u feel him at night because your still. During the day when yr active he could be moving but wont feel it as much. When hes completely still it means hes sleeping so dont worry. Also boys tend not to kick as much as girls so dont worry. Enjoy the rest of your pregnancy|`|8e7ZxOL1aa	drink orange juice my gf did that and with in minits the bub kicked and  rolled all over
MkCTwE95aa	I had that same problem and depending on what i eat still do. I am 31 weeks now and when i had spoke to my midwife about this she said to eat more protein rich foods. Protein keeps you feeling fuller for longer and therefore you dont feel as hungry so quicly after eating. At the beginning of this pregnancy i was putting on too much weight because i was always eating but once i started eating more protein rich foods like eggs for breakfast it would keep me more satisfied until lunchtime instead of having to eat all morning. Now i am able to keep my weight gain at a normal range rahter then 10 pounds in one month like i was before!  Good Luck i hope the protein helps you!!|`|iufAPDeWaa	You're eating for two. It seems like being hungry is a way to make sure you eat enough for both of you. awww... congratulations! :) And when my friend was pregnant she wasn't hungry alot but the doctor made her eat more because he said she wasn't eating enough for her baby. That doesn't mean to stuff your face either. Also every pregnancy is different. You go with the flow sort of speak.... :)|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i wish i were i am 25 weeks 4 day and eat a bite here and there if yo uare hungry esat low cal healthy things like fruit i cant wait to eat again when baby drops|`|0RoI6OXEaa	At six months the baby starts putting on more fat as well as the normal growth. Being extra hungry is a normal part of the process.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	are you having a boy?  I ate twice as much with this pregnancy and its a boy and gained 1/2 as much weight. My dr said there are studies that believe boys take up more calories.

Good luck!|`|gBDNbzJ2aa	lol every pregnancy is different :)    im just about 37 weeks.. and im eating more than ever. at the beginning i didnt eat much at all.. the baby is doing so much growing and putting on weight. im gonna have a chubbers!! haha 9 pounder. haha Awww     hopefully i don't put on any sudden end of pregnancy weight :( ill CRY! lol    your appetite might calm down here in a few weeks :)|`|WLtsumGBaa	welcome to the club! lol .... yea as the wks go by youll seem hungrier!! but stick to healthy and tasty if your concerned about weight gain =)|`|O5WberWnaa	im nearly 30wks and all i do is EAT lol.  i have my tea at night and half hour after im eating again,plus i pick all day....its nothing to worry about x|`|5Mvn48dnaa	my mom ate a lot when she was pregnant with me. whens he had my brother she ate a lot and at 6 months her ankles were as swollen in the ankles as when she gave birth to me. with my sister she didn't gain a lot cuz she had diabetes when she was pregnant. You could be having twins or a boy. One of my classmates was 11 punds when he was born. Big baby or twins. You could talk to your doctor if you are really concerened.
Yf9VZunaaa	Happened to me, we didn't know until I was 16 weeks.  (it's really easy to hide a 4 month pregnant belly if you are overweight, no so much if your on the thinner side).  You should feel movement soon tho if there is a baby and if you are still worried go get an ultrasound done to be sure, if it's been since october the ultrasound tech can definitely tell theres a baby in there|`|YkX0GZoOaa	Take another test, and then go back to the doctor.
008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	she could be and the condom could of broke you might want her to take a test if that comes back positive then you might want her to make an appointment for the gyno|`|xHKRGEg4aa	its possible that shes pregnant.

af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	go to www.babycenter.com and check your ovulation days to see what days you are more fertile. Doctors always go by the frist day of your last period so, yes. Otherwise everyones body is different i was on the depo for about 2 years and some months then I was on Yaz also for about 2 months  and finally stopped taking anything at the begining of august and still can't seem to conceive, my doctor told me that by this past Oct my period should have been back to normal and it has been but still haven't been able to get pregnant :( just keep trying especially on your fertile days. Good luck!|`|8uiH6iRbaa	are your periods 28 day cycles if they are i can help    if you had your last period on 18 jan and have 28day cycles the earliest a test will show an accurate result will be around about the 15th of feb so try and test then. the 15th should be the first day of your next period so if you don't get your period on the 15th do a test     you would only be 2 weeks nearly 3 weeks pregnant and that is far to early to detect    we count the pregnancy 40 weeks from the first day of  your last period .    hope it helps
jrVlzffeaa	Not 100% accurate, nor are their blood tests, my first urine and blood samples came back faint positive!! and then the second lot came back negative!! and I wasn't pregnant. But they are pretty accurate Xx|`|7Q7dFghmaa	I dont think your question has enough question marks.      Eat Funyuns.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	yes.     a urine test is not as accurate as a blood test.|`|Y4amfu33aa	they're accurate UNLESS you drink a ton of water before they test you|`|84lw8pLoaa	generally not..but nothing is 100%|`|80A6iHoGaa	Not really|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	they are pretty accurate

If he slipped in and had pre-ejaculate you could get pregnant if there was no condom during that time.     How does ones penis accidentally slip in?|`|UTKQmB64aa	i say that u should just wait until its time for your next menstrul cycle to come and if u miss it then ... ur probly pregnent !!!!|`|67EaIAvbaa	your tummy will get bigger.|`|wtjb0UuXaa	go to your obgyn and take a pregnancy test.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	If you miss your period then you can take a hpt. Until then there's not much you can do unless you want to take the plan B pill.|`|13cc03f46e318a1a2bae06264512cbc6aa	Sure.  There are plenty of people that got here because of that very same thing.  :)  Your chances are very small though if it was only near the entrance.  The best thing to do is keep that tip far away without the condom on it. :) The second best thing to do is get up!  Take a bunch of dry tissue or a dry wash cloth and immediately wipe off as much as you can.  When you are sure the outside is dry take a clean dry corner and poke it in a little and dry the entrance.  Use your judgment being very careful not to push anything that looks wet in farther.  Remember they swim so the dryer the better.  Go pee and wipe and dry very good again.  That reduces your chances even more.    Also that was not pre- you said it was after - that was full strength.    Don't confuse the two.  If you got some of that in there that is really taking chances.  If that really got in there farther you might want to consider planning or options.|`|KwPDVLUBaa	you could use a home pregnancy test|`|QVQdcmrgaa	No, the sperm would die because its on the outside of your body.|`|VkvhtD4daa	well, pre-*** has sperm...maybe you should do more research next time then you wont have to ask questions. you should already know this...if you are having sex.|`|AA11606210	There is a slim chance you could get pregnant that way, and even using condoms is not 100% effective. What you really need to think about was your last period. There are only a few days in the month that a female can get pregnant. That time consists of the days (allow roughly five days for ovulation) that are right in the middle of the end of your last cycle and the beginning of your next cycle. Ovulation lasts only a couple of days, but there is no way to know exactly which day this is occurring. If you had sex right after your period or right before, you're pretty safe. However, a young girls body is not regular enough for this type of birth control, which is called natural, or rhythm method. Also, if you are worrying about being pregnant, the stress can make your period late. Your breasts may become unusually tender and you may feel sick to your stomach. If you still don't have your period when it is scheduled to come, wait a week and take a pregnancy test. They are very inexpensive and you need to know as soon as possible. I hope this helps you. Feel free to look up the natural rhythm online. There is also a book about natural family planning, maybe you could find it at the library. But at your age, it is good for you to continue with condoms, (or stop having sex) as long as you realize they aren't effective all the time. For that matter, neither is the pill. My mother and my sister both got pregnant when they were on the pill. Depending on where you live, you may be able to go to the health department and get on the pill without your parents being involved. But still, use the condoms and be aware of your body and when you can get pregnant. I wish you luck, my dear.|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	buy a pregnancy testing kit|`|V2r0HRKjaa	Not if he already had the pre-*** on his penis.  Air kills the part in pre-*** that gets you pregnant.  If unsure if it was there first then go to the doctor.|`|nazzGsspaa	you may be ..and I say it because I know where a girl can get pregnant ...so if you feel sick and sleep and ask for motley foods every day than you are pregnant but it is more safe to take a test|`|qiLKlSmHaa	There is always a chance...even if a condom is used completely properly they can only claim 99.9%.  If you're worried, go take a pregnancy test although the likelihood sounds very very low.  Also, where were you in your cycle?
cfdooGylaa	You should be about 5 weeks pregnant. I never experienced morning sickness and I'm now 37 weeks with a so far healthy baby. A lot (most from what I see around me) of people who have abortions go on to have healthy pregnancies. Don't worry yourself too much. Good luck and congrats!|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	i would suggest not to get your hopes up. becasue your not too sure. not saying your not. but sometimes the home test arent always accurate. stressing yourself out could affect your period as well. so what i would suggest is get your hopes up when the dr says your pregnat|`|iwYu32N2aa	You would be 5 weeks right now, and Im sure that everything will be fine. Im 24 weeks and I never had any pregnancy symptoms. No morning sickness or headaches or anything like that.   Good luck|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	You are 5 weeks and 0 days pregnant.     Only 34 weeks and 7 days left until your baby is born.    You are at your 1st trimester.    21 days have passed from your LMP and 245 days are left until your due date (October 8th, 2009).    8% of your pregnancy is completed.      http://www.fortunebaby.com/predict_futur...|`|0RoI6OXEaa	According to my calculations you would be around 5 weeks pregnant.    As far as ruining your chances goes. I don't think it works that way. I think the only way to ruin your chances would be to become infertile. The chances of a healthy 29 year old woman being infertile is relatively low.     Many women go throughout their whole pregnancies with no moderate or severe symptoms of pregnancy, just some mild irritations, so I wouldn't base my being pregnant on symptoms. I would go by what  the hpt and the doc says.     Congratulations!!!|`|h5LOGiCmaa	Congratulations!    I know what you mean!  I took 5 pregnancy tests, and could not believe it, I was not expecting to see 2 lines, or the digital one to say pregnant.  I looked at the digital one forever, and it was amazing the word NOT was not in front of the pregnant word!      Not every women has nausea or morning sickness.  I infact was so afraid because I wasn't having the symptoms women report having.  Women were telling me to be happy that I don't have morning sickness.  I do feel nausea if I don't eat, that's it.      No you did not blow your chances.  God has given you a blessing, because it is time for you to have one.    If your period are 28 days apart your due date is OCTOBER 8th, 2009  you are about 5 weeks pregnant.    Congrats!  Thank God for the blessing!|`|YkX0GZoOaa	You are probably only slightly over 4 weeks pregnant (2 weeks gestational). I wouldn't worry about it. Abortion has no effect on your ability to carry future (or present) pregnancies to term. Please don't listen to the people on this board that will tell you that it will, it's incorrect medical advice and it will only stress you out (which can lead to a miscarriage).  Good luck.|`|4QSsJ23Caa	How far gone you are???  Or how far along you are.  the doctor will tell you at the appointment. they calculate it by your last period.|`|e3fd3W8maa	Hi  I am sure that you haven't blown your chances, I know more than 1 mom who miscarried or terminated that went on to have healthy babies. According to due date calculator you would be 5 weeks pregnant and due 10/08/2009. Call your Dr. for confirmation of pregnancy though  Congrats|`|aaj0M0Vnaa	It sounds in my opinion that you are in the veeeery early stages of pregnancy maybe only a week or two?? but a scan will confirm your dates. both times i have been pregnant, the only symptoms ive had are slightly tender breasts and a bit headachy too.  Its normal to worry but i would recommend the best thing for you to do is RELAX!!! i think, if your relaxed..baby is, if your stressed..baby is.. thats just my opinion and believe me your not the first to feel as tho its not real..i think you feel that way till you have a scan and see it. good luck.xx|`|E1ppYqCtaa	Ok sweetie.  I have had 4 miscarriages 1 termination and 3 live births. You are ok. now breath. You have to understand everyone is different and although you have lil to no symptoms(u r so lucky)  your mind could be playing with you. It is called mental pregnancy, you'll feel it may even look it, but your not. Even anxiety and stress can cause a missed period. I am telling you this so you don't get your hopes up (JIC) However of course you sound to be, the best test is a blood test. Good luck and let me know.
CUYuAGF5aa	After passing week 12-13 your chances of miscarriage are greatly reduced and your into the major developement of your baby stage.  You should get a scan round about this time to ensure the baby is developing ok.  They can tell from 5-6 weeks if you have an ultrasound and can see a heartbeat but sometimes this can't be seen until week 7-8.    Good luck!!!|`|AA11564934	Nobody will know 100% that it will be ok until it is born or even after that.    The rule of thumb is to wait until 3 months to announce it to everyone.|`|YseGAHIfaa	12 week scan x|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well once they see a heartbeat that is a great sign but that usually shows up between week 6 and 7.  And once you pass week 12 your chances of miscarriage drop significantly.|`|JFjc5g8eaa	u have to waite and pass the 20 week mark miscarriage percent is 40% that's high and im 8 weeks and scared to death im having triplets|`|WSbfkuSZaa	Generally if you make it through the 1st trimester then you're fine and the baby will be ok. I think my first ultra sound was about 11 weeks and we got to see our tiny baby for the first time. In the next few weeks they monitored the heart beat and now I am 20 weeks and we have our next ultra sound on Monday. So it won't take long for them to start monitoring things. Just be careful, don't stress yourself out and don't lift heavy things, you know the normal cautions. Best Wishes!|`|sbboNOA5aa	You should be in contact with Doctor for your safety and your baby..|`|Y4DPDmrfaa	The babies heart just started beating this week! But its too early to do an ultrasound because he or she is so small. They will probably wait until at least 8 weeks if your doctor is planning on doing an ultrasound to check your due date and the babies heart. If their not doing an ultrasound, then they can try to hear for the babies heartbeat with a doppler at 12 weeks.|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	Usually they can start checking stuff out when you first go it, such as finding the heart beat, etc.    12 weeks is usually the point where most people feel they are in the clear.|`|A93BVDXgaa	Be excited! your expecting!   It is something that your going to worry about constantly your never going to completely know till you hold them. You lll be relieved when you hear the heart beat! then again when you see the baby on the ultrasound, then again after like 23 weeks. So it will be an emotional roller coster! But be happy!|`|Yz2TvEMlaa	"The loss rate between 8.5 weeks LMP and birth is about two percent"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage    it's ok to be scared. I was too. I did a lot of internet reading and it seems that before the fetal period there is a 25% chance of miscarriage unless you have a pre-existing condition that increases your chances. Read as much as you can. You may hear things that will further frighten you, but finding some of these numbers is actually comforting. Good luck and congrats!!!!
8y0837nlaa	Yes you are pregnant.. I had a d&c on November and a period in December and tested Monday and i got a really faint positive... tested on tuesday another faint positive tested wednesday at the doctors and told me i was pregnant..

I think you need to retest. It may be hcg left from the last pregnacy, but it has been a little while so maby baby!! Ihope all goes well for you!!
BKr3y30maa	Well in the next couple days you will be most fertile.  So I would recommend having sex everyday again....or every other day.  Definetly have sex on the 9th which is Monday.  It's showing you the most fertile that day.  Alot of people think propping the pillow up helps, but the truth is sperm live inside you for days....and it's really not necessary, but if it eases your mind doing that, then by all means, continue.  It took us sometime to conceive our son.  I was on round 2 of Clomid when I found out I was pregnant.  I am not saying for you to go to your doctor and request Clomid.  He/she probably would recommend you and your husband trying for at least 6 months on your own.  Not just that, but some people on Clomid have a tendency to have multiples....something you may not be ready for.   Good luck and hang in there. In due time, your prayers will be answered!!!!|`|wvGv8WQ6aa	Use ovulation kits, start having sex and testing about 10 days after the FIRST day of your period by the 14 day after your first day of bleeding it should be positive. Make sure to have sex every other day or every day for a week before your ovulation because sperm stays alive in you for 3-5 days. This worked for me... Like you said prop your hips up as high as you can and stay there for 45 mins.. NO LESS... trust me, i tried for 6 months and the one time i did that it was successful!!! Don't let any drain out.. trust me its a long 45 min but totally worth it. Also start taking prenatal vitamins, and limit the things that aren't good for you like caffeine, and sugars. Eat Healthy, lots of folic acid!     Good luck!|`|cypZ0ykXaa	i guess u hav a 29-30 day cycle. so, you might ovulate frm 6feb to 11 feb. try during yur ovualtion days dear. afternoons r good to try even.better u go through a website to calculate the ovulation days. "good luck"|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	You need to find out when you're ovulating. Using the calendar method is't very reliable because not everyone ovulates mid cycle, or regularly (I ovulate anywhere from day 12 to day 20 of a 28-30 day cycle, but generally around day 17). Get a home ovulation predictor kit and start charting your basal body temperature first thing in the morning, and keep track of your cervical mucous. When you're about to ovulate, the OPK will detect a surge in your luteinising hormone levels, and after you have ovulated your temperature will go up. During your fertile period, you'll notice that your mucous is clear and wet, a bit like egg white. Try to have sex every other day while you're most fertile, and hopefully you'll get your BFP!    I hope all this helps, good luck!! xx|`|rmse6Mj8aa	if your cycles are generally on the 24th that averages at least a 30 day cycle if not slightly longer. assuming that your luteal phase (the time between ovulation and getting your period) is the normal 14 days then you can't expect to O much before the 8th although it's possible to O early so it's great that you have been BDing since your period. Keep up your fantastic bd-ing schedule til the 10th to cover all your chances, or even the 11th if you can.  this is the best O calendar I have found. it depends on your cycle lenth and luteal phase but i would say between now and the 9th is your best shot so bd every day or at least every other day!   http://www.askdramy.com/ovulationcalc.ht...   good luck xxx|`|AcOVnKtlaa	Hello Jesikahlynn,    To be honest, I don't really understand about how are things work with women's period. But regarding your husband's sperm count,there are things he can do to maintain his level of sperm count or even increasing it!    For men who want to improve their fertility, it is important to make some fundamental changes regarding their lifestyle and diet. Reduction or ideally elimination of alcohol, caffeine and nicotine, more attention to the nutritional quality of your food and lower stress levels will go a long way towards improving fertility.    The Calendar Also Matters To Men. Sperm counts are higher in the winter and lower in the summer. This may be because cooler temperatures are associated with increased sperm production. Sperm counts are also higher in the morning than at other times of day.    But there are things your husband should avoid in order to maintain his level of sperm count. More details about them on source articles.

I know other people who made the decision not to have children for similar reasons, some adopted and others didn't because they were worried about early death and leaving the kids parent-less again.

My son has OCD and it is an Autistic Disorder that you are born with.|`|23MPcnNqaa	I can understand your concerns on the first part.  But I would talk with a doctor to see what medical problems can be passed on to any children that you have.    As for the last part, learning to discipline a child is all part of parenting.  You shouldn't not have kids for fear of not being able to control them.|`|FFF7oGDzaa	If it is a good reason for you then yes, dont worry about what other people think. Some people just dont want kids, there is nothing wrong with that.|`|GRyFxwTbaa	Not wanting kids is a good enough reason not to have them.    Don't let anyone bully you into thinking otherwise.

Honest. Not everyone on the planet is meant to be a parent and that's okay.    However I would like to point out one thing. If everyone decided to not have children because of some weird or unpleasant gene they may or may not pass on to any offspring, the world's population would be a lot smaller. In my family we have lots alcoholism, depression, bipolar disorder, & schizophrenia genes running around in addition to high blood pressure, IBS, several neurological diseases, diverticulitis, and Parkinson disease. Not to mention whatever family history my husband's family has. I know that my daughter may or may not get some or any of these genes. Many of them are very treatable and can even be managed by lifestyle changes. The moral of the story is: Heredity is not destiny.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I would see which medical can be passed on to your kids.OCD is not the worse thing you can pass off to your kids.And if you really want kids maybe try adoption.

Try getting on all fours and swaying your hips back and forth to move the baby off your nerve, it works sometimes.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I had bad sciatic pain also but it was only in my butt and it was horrible trying to walk up and down stairs.  Also leg cramps are a sign you are low on calcium.  It didn't complicate my delivery at all but I also had a spinal and didn't feel that much anyway.|`|5Mvn48dnaa	yeah
AA10186411	Earliest is 15 weeks, but sometimes still cannot be seen.  Usually the sex is determined betwee 18-22 weeks at the anatomy ultrasound (commonly the only ultrasound women get during a pregnancy).  But if you are like me, your child may not cooperate and it may end up being a surprise!|`|6542d65c904582403b7e46c7c170a38eaa	My doctor said 20 weeks is best but even then, they couldn't determine my second child's sex.  The picture was clean as day with my first at 20 weeks though.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	it's best to wait until 18-20 weeks so it will be more accurate|`|5JB1fHz9aa	Usually no earlier than like 17 weeks, but with my current pregnancy I found out at 14 weeks.  It's easier to tell if you are having a boy (I am) earlier in your pregnancy because of obvious reasons.  Most people don't find out until around 20 weeks because that's when they like to do the anatomy ultrasound.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i am told you have to be at least 16 weeks but the longer you wait (18-20 weeks) the better your confirmation will be    i found out the sex at 18 weeks|`|Iqifd3SGaa	It is best to do it anytime after 18 weeks.|`|O5WberWnaa	i was 20wks|`|5Mvn48dnaa	my mom found out with my brother and sister when she was 21 weeks|`|Y4DPDmrfaa	They can try at 15 weeks, but sometimes they might mistake a boy for a girl because their little wee wee isn't as developed as it would be at 20 weeks. Its best to wait until at least your 18th week, or even better your 20th week. I got mine at 20 weeks and we could see his little penis, it was obvious he was a boy. =]|`|A93BVDXgaa	around 20 weeks but that's only if he or she wants you to know!|`|Yr65nHRkaa	18 weeks.
1KIwM1uOaa	It may be boyish but it is her birthday and this is what she wants.  Actually you could have a lot of fun with that theme.  As far as the cake goes you could go anywhere that bakes them and tell them you need a cake with outer space on it and I am sure they could create one. You may also consider doing a cup cake display grouping the cupcakes to look like the solar system.|`|Elxuvon8aa	go to your local bakery and see what they will do some will put most anything on a cake others you have to choose from their book  If you can not find anything just buy a cake and find toys to put on it.  take lots of pictures because she probably will not remebber it.|`|bqehqlFHaa	No, it's not boyish. It might be just what she's into right at this second! If she has some books of outer space stuff, take a picture from it.  Take it to a bakery and ask them to make a cake like the picture.     Also, you can go to a party supply store and see if they have cup and plates.  Then take a plate with the theme on it and take it to the bakery.|`|HWtG9dkzaa	It may be boyish - buts its her birthday - let her have the theme of her choice. There is to much of 'this is what girls do' and 'this is what boys do' - let your daughter be different.    As for the cake - why not bake one yourself, and then ice it with blue icing - and decorate with various peices of candy to make it look like stars and planets.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	You must be quite the feminist! JK. Space is a great theme because there is so much you can do with it. For a cake consider creating a space ship or a solar system with small cakes and cupcakes. Alternately you could make a round dome cake with craters for the moon. Here are many other ideas:    http://www.coolest-kid-birthday-parties....  http://www.amazingmoms.com/htm/party-spa...  http://www.birthdaypartyideas.com/html/s...|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I think that if that is what she wants then go for it! You shouldn't put stereotypes on kids that young. I think you could make a cake....sounds easy to me. Just bake a round cake and dye the vanilla frosting any color you want to match a planet. Or you could use two or three different colors and put "dollops" all over the cake then kinda swirl them together. Of course, you could go to a grocery store and see what ideas they have if you aren't a baker. Or you could just make a regular cake and write something silly like "you are outta this world" lol or an alien cake with green "goo" This is a great theme, so many ideas to choose from. Good luck!|`|RIVywiykaa	Don't worrie about the boyish part she'll get over it when shes older.    i was i tomboy|`|v3LhdCMCaa	Whatever she wants....its her birthday.  Good luck.
H74F8jxuaa	Your ovulation is NOT always 13-17 days into your cycle!  First of all, you need to know that all women ovulate at different times.  Since you don't know when you ovulate, then you should buy ovulation predictor kits so you know when you are about to ovulate.  There are tall tale signs when you are fertile, for example: cervix will be high, soft, and open, cervical mucus will be the consistency of eggwhites, etc.  You should get an account on www.fertilityfriend.com.  It will tell you everything you need to know.  Best of luck.|`|PA5iBQZAaa	after you have your period about 1 week later you should notice discharge that looks like egg white really stretchy,mild cramping on one side could also be a sign of dropping an egg and just trusting God :) also after sex continue to lay there for at least 20 mins so the swimmers can get up there elevation  will help too of  course.the best position is missionary which is because of deeper penetration so with that being said good luck and God Bless and just remember put your trust in God and he will always get you through God Bless you!|`|cypZ0ykXaa	the only thing to keep on mind is the ovulation days (i.e 13-17) day after yur first menstuaration day if u r on a regular cycle. get started with yur folic acid.i dont thing anything else counts
WSbfkuSZaa	Natural sugars helped me. And protein. Usually when I would drink a big glass of juice or eat some sort of fruit I would perk up a bit. Eating something with a lot of protein in it like eggs, peanuts, chicken, really anything would help me. I'm 20 weeks now and I still use natural sugars rather than caffeine to perk me up.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	Make sure you take your vitamins, and ask for help from family and friends. I understand that you have to care for your daughter but you also have to take care of yourself and new baby-to-be. The fatigue should pass after your 1st trimester. Good luck|`|fZgqzPSNaa	Drink LOTS of water!!! That seemed to help. I couldn't nap much either due to working 40 hr. weeks but try laying down when and if your daughter does. It's pretty hard to avoid, I started getting more energy around my 2nd trimester. Im having a boy so maybe you are 2 if your tired and your weren't with your girl!!|`|28fNd725aa	I know its hard but just try to nap as much as possible... like when the two little ones are napping.... I was  tired for the 1st month or so... but one day it will just be gone.  Remember you body  is working very hard building your newest addition and it gets tired and needs its rest... try not to deny it to much!!      Congrats|`|acj9mB9Paa	Well, the two kids SHOULD be taking naps still!!  They need 10 1/2 hours of sleep a night and a 1 1/2 hour afternoon nap until they are three.  So, nap when they nap and go to bed as soon as your daughter does!!  I do this with my son (almost 2) and it is the only way I survive!  Also, it makes my son MUCH easier to deal with when he has enough sleep!!  Also, when I get all I NEED to get done in the house (not always all I want to get done, but the funk is gone) I lay down on his bed while he plays in his room.  He will interact with me a little, but usually just plays by himself.  Just make sure that your daughters room is baby proof!!  Don't get me wrong, I am still very tired, but I can at least stay awake through dinner!!  LOL  With my son I was tired until I was about 5 months pregnant, with this one I am only three months pregnant, but it is already starting to subside.    Also, I take a REALLY great prenatal vitamin called Neevo.  It is expensive, but it has a TON of B-12 and that REALLY will perk you up!!|`|gBDNbzJ2aa	Stayed active.. once you lay down, your gonna nap, and your gunna be dead to the world lol the best thing to do is just stay active so you don't get sleepy :) and sleep as much as possible at night :)    37 weeks with a baby GIRL!

mDkUmEUzaa	Its an awful name - for either sex|`|AA11366224	Great idea.  He or she would be bullied throughout life and grow up to hate you.|`|zhk8o514aa	That is really deep thinking what you did on your baby.  A teenager named Goth.      Endless teasing right there.|`|GutYNu9baa	The only person i knew with a similar Cristian name was a bloke called Godfrey, then, when nicknamed, he was always known to all as ...Goff.|`|hqogf9oGaa	I'm not too sure of this name (sorry) particularly as it may stereotype your child as belonging to the group known as "goths".  However, if I had to choose whether it's a boy or birls name I would have to say boy.|`|ZMWjdKfraa	Don't be ridiculous.... do you know that here in Spain its illegal to give a child a name that may cause it harm or distress in later life.  This sounds like a toll question ...just like your othe question asking about the boys name buddy.|`|99Dvcw29aa	thats horrible unless your child wants to be emo by age 5|`|HynUWGHcaa	NO!  DONT !  You will wreck there life !|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I hope this is a joke.|`|C4miEeuYaa	eww no..Sorry but your kid will be made fun of in school..Why would you do that?|`|FKzFx3mDaa	Hey, I think that it is a unique name, one that no one else will have! I would probably have to see the middle and last name with it to see if they fit, but if you have your heart set on it, than why not? I think that it is more of a boy's name, I would probably change it from his from a first name to a middle name, just because it would make the naming process easier, and you could always use it as a nick-name. Try and give your baby some options for when he/she grows up. Maybe if he/she had a first name that could be shortened into a nick-name as well as her middle name (goth), than it could be more of a choice for your kid to make herself/himself. That is just my opinion. I hope that this helped!|`|cn2rvsdOaa	That is a hrrible name!!!!!!!!|`|5j0NgLDmaa	Are you serious? You wouldn't really name your kid that, would you? Try giving them that has some sort of Goth reference. How about Siouxie (from Siouxie and the Banshees) for a girl?|`|PPyMhRJAaa	It's not a name at all!|`|IvkNTqDMaa	That is an AWFUL name...sorry.|`|aWWgPkryaa	Let them make their own choice....it sounds like a name you might give your cat.  Sorry.       Why don't you buy a cat too, that way you can get the name out of your system?|`|VBWfP0Vdaa	Not a good idea to name anyone goth.|`|yfmZDXPTaa	goth? like the dark dressing people? no no! please don't! your child may never forgive you! it would be like social suicide for them! prob for a boy though. but he would be destined to be emo!|`|KV7OGaJbaa	Can you imagine if your child turned out to be a chav?! This name is begging for bullying.|`|S0Clu20aaa	Not good sorry !!!  Are you looking for your child to be battered at school every day ??  Children are crule at the best of times..   "DON'T DO IT"  Good luck!|`|urarletqaa	It should be neither. Maybe you should use 'Geth' as a boy's name.|`|pcCMEeo2aa	That is an awful name for either gender.|`|pbQH9HyCaa	O no.   not for a kid|`|278ef5bf786e21e346959814856bfaf8aa	Neither. That would only be for someone who hates their child|`|iTOCf9Mzaa	thts stupid, wotcha gonna do if it grows up to be a chav or gangsta? will sound stupid thn!|`|oWKOlJyjaa	Okay, uhmm maybe for a Sims game, but for real life? No!! You don't name your child Goth, and expect them to grow up living in Hot Topic, it just doesn't work out that way!! That's like naming your child Indie, Pop, Rock, or Emo! However, if you like gothic names, there's Mortimer, and Vladimir. I love Romanian names. They're totally goth. It's like Dracula's family, with awesome names.|`|8mQVfDRqaa	go ahead and use it! if you want your child to be bullied for the rest of their life.    it is a horrible name! don't use it!    I would say it is a boy's name though.|`|SAVkfNs4aa	boy if your deciding to create a suicidal constantly bullied teen|`|8bbc7a133643da63ae7caf30623bdc4caa	I would not recommend this at all....|`|98WKYtfwaa	I'm sure if you call your child Goth then he/she will get beaten up everyday and bullied throughout his or hers life.    It's not a good name for either sex. Don't do it!|`|2hoTmOlKaa	well my  sister's friend has the surname goth,  but i dont know, it just doesnt sound like a name,
AA11607818	Think about it, it'll be white, holding a baby and going outside. Would mean alot of cleaning!|`|PHKSoUTDaa	Essex.  With matching stilettos for mother and baby!

urarletqaa	its nice if you like it. Not sure about Messiah though|`|7dGpL4mSaa	Sorry, but I really don't like it.|`|99Dvcw29aa	is this for a boy or girl??

That's a lot to live up to and Lennox feels like glassware. Basically unless you concieved as a virgin I think this name is just wrong.|`|sbboNOA5aa	Gud name|`|VBWfP0Vdaa	I Would not like Messiah as my name|`|pbQH9HyCaa	good name but does it flow with the last name|`|pcCMEeo2aa	I don't like the name Messiah but Lennox is nice.|`|VxZHkMzwaa	lennox is cute.  messiah just makes me think of religion and god and judaism .  it could be cute if you got a pure lush little kid.  + plus imagine being a 80 year old "messiahh get back to the old peoples home." - get me ?  sorryyy
VS8mactUaa	Well, You could take a test now and probably get accurate resluts because you missed you period, like you said they seem to be following a direct pattern, so by now you should have missed your period. If it tests negitive and your period still doesnt come, test in a week or so and repeat as long as you like, tho if it keeps testin negitive, and no period a trip to the doctor is advised.|`|BKr3y30maa	I would wait until you are due for your period, however if the length of your cycle varies, that can be tough.  However the lengths of them are in the normal range. Yes, you can be pregnant even though you have cramps. It was the exact same way with me.
vue9NOhYaa	I didn't look for any specific signs (beyond being able to sit up) , but she WAS 5 1/2 months, so was very likely to be ready, and when I tried, she could eat from the spoon.     Normal signs of readiness include:  1. Ability to sit up well with support.  2. Around 6 months or older (unless baby is CLEARLY in need of something a bit earlier, but never before 4 months).  3. Interest in what you are eating.  4. Able to eat from a spoon. (Meaning, opens for the spoon and can eat. If she has to suck it off the end of the spoon, or it has to be mixed very watery, that doesn't count.) You NEVER of course feed solids from a bottle or 'infa-feeder.' If baby can't eat from a spoon, she isn't ready.    When you do start, you don't have to give cereal.  It's a traditional first food, but has no benefits beyond cheapness and convenience.  Most babies do like it (because it tastes like the milk it's mixed with), but a few hate it because it's so bland.  And some are constiapted by it.  So, esp. if you wait until around 6 months, you can start with any stage one food. Or, if you wait longer, like 7-8 months (which is perfectly ok) you can start with table foods.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...|`|q7HvkRpyaa	When one bottle doesn't fill her up anymore is generally a pretty good sign that she is ready for cereal. You can start to put some in her bottle now. Just like a teaspoon of it mixed with the milk or formula.   My son was going through a bottle and a half at about 3 months and we couldn't keep enough formula to suit him, so we started giving him really watered down cereal then. It worked.   Their digestive systems can't handle the cereal if it is really thick, but if you make it kinda soupy it is fine.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	My doctor said when he starts intently watching food and smacking his lips he is ready!  Four months is the earliest you are supposed to start, but I am waiting because my baby doesn't seem interested yet.  They are supposed to be able to sit up (assisted) too.|`|5DJcir9saa	I just started my baby on cereal this past week.  He is just over 4 months.  The signs I went by were that he had doubled his birth weight, he INTENTLY watched us while we were eating and would even reach out to try and grab it, he is able to sit up very well, while assisted, and he holds his head up well.  With the first feeding, I just took it slow and gave him very small bites to see how he'd react to eating from a spoon.  And he picked it up like it was nothing.  I would wait until at least 4 months, although some say to wait until 6 months, my pediatrician told me 4-6 months and said I could start feeding my baby cereal, then fruit, then veggies, and then meat.  Waiting a few days in between trying new things to make sure there were no allergic reactions.  When you do decide to try and feed her cereal, take it slow, and make sure she is understanding how to swallow.  If she gets upset or is having a very difficult time, then she might not be ready yet.|`|8t8NjjnVaa	Physical signs are when your baby is able to sit up well with little or no support and can reach for and pick up objects.  Some babies will do this earlier than others, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are ready for solids.    Like you said, you should wait until 6 months to give his system time to mature and be able to actually process what you feed him.  Introducing solids too early has been shown to increase the risk of obesity and diabetes later in life, so it's best to wait.    If you refuse to wait until 6 months, do not give him any solids at all until at least 4 months.  That's the absolute earliest.    Also, you don't ever have to feed him cereal.  It's a nutritionally-empty filler food.  It's loaded with iron, but only 4% is bioavailable (meaning 96% of the iron in it gets excreted), so it can cause constipation, and it won't provide any actual nutrition for him.    Doctors sometimes tell people to start with cereal because it's unlikely to cause allergic reactions.  The longer you wait, the less of a chance of an allergic reaction.    You can start with vegetables that actually have taste and nutritional value if you want to, but again, no earlier than 4 months, but it's a whole lot better to wait until at least 6 months.    And remember that once you do start solids, it should only be a bite or two.  Formula and/or breastmilk needs to be his main source of nutrition until he is a year old.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	It's important that your baby be able to sit up well (assisted) and not display any tongue thrusting.  This is an inborn reflex that pushes foreign matter out of the mouth (a sign that the baby isn't yet ready for solids).
zJv8LA5Yaa	It's possible but it could also be side effects of going off birth control.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	There is always a chance but I would think that it is your hormones trying to adjust themselves since you went off the nuvaring.|`|7oNpIf4Naa	I think that the nuvaring may have messed you up.  That happens alot when getting off birthcontrol.  I would go to the doctor if I was you.
urarletqaa	Its nice, very pretty name|`|UlEUWdhPaa	I think it's absolutely gorgeous! I love old fashioned, feminine names. Adalyn was a the top of my name list for girl names. You hardly ever hear it. Great choice!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I prefer Adaline Grace or even just Adda Grace would be better.|`|U49so236aa	Adelyn or Adelaide is better than Addalyn.    Try those instead?|`|C4miEeuYaa	That is BEAUTIFUL! My daughters middle name is Grace.(Alyssa Grace).I think it goes good with any really feminine name..And I thought I was the only one who liked the name Addalyn..Addilynn is how I would spell it though. (But thats me-I like yours too.)|`|FKzFx3mDaa	I love the name Addalyn Grace! It is unique and it sweet for a little girl!|`|230NbPVUaa	I like it but find a better spelling for Addalyn... like Adelyn|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I really like it! I have heard Addison before, but not Addalyn. Very cute.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	It's totally made up. Just stick with Lynn.|`|TN72hvpEaa	I like it but, I would use the original spelling Adelyn. I posted something about this name yesterday and didn't get good results but, I LOVE it.|`|pcCMEeo2aa	I like it.|`|AA12333757	Lovely name!!|`|57X92zknaa	Addalyn sounds made-up.|`|qBl07nnUaa	Addalyn - looks made up.  Grace - too common.|`|pbQH9HyCaa	its so pretty.  does it go with the last name though|`|Uyiw7bECaa	its lovely :)  very original too :)|`|oWKOlJyjaa	Beautiful... It does sound Irish=]
JFjc5g8eaa	look i did it all u have to space them out but it didn't matter the metformin made me violently ill so i stopped taking them i just watched what i ate for a month lost 30lbs fast in that month then took the clomid and BAM pregnant the first try now im 8 weeks with triplets oh yeah clomid has a high multiple rate so dont be surprised if you get many|`|OT6jkYUraa	You should take 3 at a time and with pcos and clomids its a struggle but clomids will help alot when trying to get pregnant but with clomids there is a chance to get more than one baby at a time, pcos is a realy pain in the ...... But yes clomids wil help in that apartment.
z6BtwSE8aa	When I started taking Metformin, I started out with 3 a day, not building it up like you. But definitely space them out. The information that I got from the pharmacy with my prescription actually says that if you miss one not to take 2 at one time later on. What I do is take one with breakfast, one with lunch, and one with dinner. That way I don't forget, and you are supposed to take them with food anyway so it doesn't make you sick.     I've been taking 1500mg for about a month and a half now. Before that I was getting my period every 3 months. I've had 2 already. Cycles have been a little short, but I did ovulate this last one. Not pregnant yet, but hopefully soon!|`|BKr3y30maa	Got pregnant with my son on Round 2 of Clomid!!!!  :)
p2Njf5gBaa	When you start on solids, a few bits at a time to start is great.  once they loose interest, don't try force feeding them to start.  When you start solids with them, you are pretty much just introducing them to solids and letting them sample.  They should still be getting most of their calories and nutrition from breast milk or formula.      If you don't feed them out of the jar, the jar will last in the fridge for up to 3 days.|`|vue9NOhYaa	When you  offer any new food, offer just a small amount at first. (Esp. if it's the very first solid food.)  A teaspoon or two is plenty.  Once you're sure he doesn't have a bad reaction, you can offer more.  Give him his regular bottle first, and then let him have as much or as little solid food as he wants. Solids are just given once or twice a day for the first few months of offering them. They are just for fun, and you don't want him cutting back on his milk.     Leftovers will keep a couple of days in the fridge.
AA11512011	Take a test, If you don't have any call the doctor and go in for a urine and blood test.|`|f3JUERf5aa	I think its time for you to go to your local retail store and buy a pregnancy test... it will tell you what you need to know and where to go next... If not, i would call your dr. either way...|`|Vam2QMBPaa	Do a Home Pregnancy Test, thats the only way to confirm it.  The bleeding could be pregnancy spotting or your period.
oXzHvsBpaa	Talk to your doctor. If it is a UTI then you need to be put on an Anit-biotic. I had 3 UTIs in my pregnancy. You can in the mean time drink Cranberry juice. Though talk to your doctor soon because a untreated UTI can lead believe it or not to a early birth.|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	you should call you're doctor & make a fast appointment.it might be infection which is not good for you're baby.doesn't you're doctor take a urine test from you in every appointment? you probably have gotten it recently.  call you're doctor.he/she would be able to help you.  good luck.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I had a bladder infection while I was pregnant and my OB gave me some antibodies and it got rid of it in less than 2 days. Go to the doctor or ask him/her to call in a prescription for you.|`|XmJvXSqvaa	it does sound like a uti. but you dont have to be scared. they are completely normal with pregnant people. and i've had once since i started my pregnancy and i'm 23 weeks now. they just give you a medication to take and it gets better. thank god! hahah. they say it can result in pre-mature labor. so make sure takin the medication they give you.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	drink plenty of fluids|`|3ba0f17b4aa5b8bb81276a3443df1503aa	I'm 12 weeks and i have a uti or bladder infection (the dr at the naval hospital didn't tell me) But they gave me meds! its called Nitrofurantoin. Its an antibiotic which you can take up until your 35th week of pregnancy.  to get rid of the pain you can take cystex. Its a while box with red writing. you take 2 pills 2ce a day and it works great to relieve the pain! I hope that helps you out a lot.   But if you can go to your dr. All you have to do is give a urine sample and they will be able to tell you if you have one or not! Its nothing to be to concerned about. Good luck with everything and the Baby.|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Drink Cranberry juice and lots of water, it sounds as though you need to flush out your urinary tract system. Always make sure you are drinking enough water.
AA12145826	She's correct that they probably aren't suitable for children, however given their historic value she may want to consider donating them to a museum instead of destroying them. She could even put them up on Ebay and or some other auction site and at least make some money off of them. Many people collect WW2 memorabilia and that sounds like something that could be very desirable to a collector.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	It's history.  Destroying them changes nothing.      I would put them away and save them personally.  But, then again, I love antiques (and am a bit of a history nerd).      ETA for Breezy: I am FAAAAR from being a neo-nazi or white supremacist!!!!!!!  That is absolutely insane.|`|AA11210211	Honestly I would sell it and maybe give the money to a charity,why not take something from the bad past and give it to good??|`|AA10186411	You are correct, they are not suitable for children or anyone else.|`|s1utniuvaa	She could try to donate them to a museum. Or just destroy them. They are little pieces of filth but they are also history.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	It's history, something we have all learned from. They could be taken into a museum.     I'm completely against destroying them, they tell a story about how even as young kids the beliefs that they had were passed down in a way that they would grow to represent that mind set.     They are suitable for children and adults to learn a lesson about hate and what it does to a country. Please don't destroy them, pass on the story and history.    EDIT:  Breezy -  Take a class in anthropology and maybe you'd understand the significance of keeping them.  It is history, it is a physical piece of history. You can read about it all day long, but I know some people need physical evidence. It would be like reading about old archaeological artifact (dinosaur bones for instance) and never being able to see them physically, for some it makes it more real.     This doesn't make you a neo-nazi, most people these days don't even know what the true meaning of that is... please understand your history before you open your mouth.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Those are antiques and will one day be worth millions. I'll send you my address and you can send them to me before you destroy them. Please. People pay very good money for those bits of history.|`|4cprznZcaa	there are collectors who would pay big bucks for them, i wouldnt let my child play with them either so i would sell them to a collector of if she felt bad for taking money for them then maybe donate them to a museum|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I would call local museums and see if there is any interest. Obviously they are not appropriate for children to play with but they may be of historical interest to many.|`|0QYIbn1saa	Your girlfriend is right.  Listen to her.    John, why have you been asking this question for 2 years?|`|XOtOMncwaa	I wouldn't let my son play with them, but I wouldn't destroy them either, if you don't want them I would try to sell them on e-bay or something, you never know what their worth!|`|UhAHaOWFaa	Sell them to a museum.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I agree with Nina.I would put them away.and save them.|`|ifSWXqU5aa	Although toys like that are unsuitable for children, I own a Nazi 5 Reichmark coin from Germany.|`|E1ppYqCtaa	Why don't you call a Holocaust museum and sell it to them and take the money to get her something with less of a bad history.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	i would put them"up"...they are part of history...i wouldnt let any child play with or display them...mainly because they could be made of something dangerous,like lead......but putting them away in an attic to preserve...she could show them to her children when they are older,and when they are learning about that era....they would even be neat to use in a school project or something....hold on to them...|`|SB0aKhFbaa	NOOOOO! those could be worth alot of money!! not only that but they have historical vlaue!!! do not crush these things.. nobody agrees with the nazis but crushing this peice of history will do nothing.         you should slap your gf|`|JdgEp2X1aa	I don't know why people are saying keep them, its history. What are you going to learn from some toys that symbolized hatred? Who would want to have nazi toys anyways....maybe neo-nazi's or white supremacist. If you want to know the history of nazi's then read a book or watch a program about them. I think, she should get rid of them.
AA11512011	yes. The blood clots can travel through your veins and arteries and get to your heart or lungs which can cause serious problems. Please talk with your doctor about any worries you have regarding your birthcontrol.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	blood clots are dangerous and birth control pills can increase your risk of having blood clots but I'm pretty sure its a small risk. My mom got small blood clots in her legs, that were painful, when she too the pill but I never had any such side effect.     Blood clots are dangerous because if left alone they might travel to your heart or lungs or brain and cause serious complications.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Yes,they really are.They can cause death in some cases.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	blood clots also known as dvt or thrombus are life threatening.  If a clot were to develop and dislodge it can go your heart lungs or cause stroke.  They are often fatal.|`|IINSHqz2aa	I had a thrombosis after surgery (c-section)  in my left leg.  I spent 16 DAYS in the hospital, not even allowed to get up to go to the bathroom!  The clot was lodged in my groin, 16 days of heparin in the hosp.  14 more days of blood thinners after, and very strict instructions to NEVER use birth controls pills, patches or any form of oral contraception or hormone therapy.  It was not fun, very painful and I would never want to go through it again.|`|20yqahaRaa	NOT in just birth control in every part of your body if you have blood clot especially in the brain this is sometimes the cause of death of boxers and brawlers .    its because the flow of blood is in abnormal state, its gonna burst and overtraffic in your veins and arteries and if it explode it'll scarce and maybe the cause of your death bcoz of internal bleeding and  bad circulation
E6T9DPT9aa	Depending on the age of consent - if it's 16 then it's perfectly ok and legal. If it's 18, then it's illegal and he could be arrested. If 18, just keep it quiet then you wont be found out, and he wont be arrested.    (Sorry I don't know that legal age!)    USE A CONDOM.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|aOCfLAJJaa	It's legal, anyone who is 16 is legal to have sex. UNLESS it's with someone under the age of 16.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Where I live it would be illegal.  I live in Wisconsin.  The age of consent in Minnesota is 16.|`|Z9360MMxaa	In most states/provinces you are of consensual age at 16. Meaning if you said okay it's not illegal.|`|mC838ZbLaa	It really depends on which gender is which age because guys are considered legal at age 16 girls aren't till 18. so just check some local laws where ya live|`|8XURx7nzaa	yes he can can in trouble for statuatory rape even if it was consenual or not|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I don't know about Minnesota but I live in the UK and 16 is the age of consent here.|`|dbXnW5emaa	You'd have to be married for it to be legal.|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	That is considered 'rape'. Even if it's consensual, he would still be an adult, and her a minor. Unless it's the other way around, which is just creepy.  But yes, in most countries it's illegal.|`|YEV9D8Jvaa	depends on the state|`|wzXJOSIeaa	If your parents press charges that's where the problem would come in.|`|H90uflbFaa	its illegal|`|i3pn4jNcaa	its fine if you are willing. but if you were to become pregnant then parents can get involved and get into the laws and stuff. so be careful & make sure that your both ready|`|ldN2AL1zaa	of course not      unless if the 18 or 16 force one of them.....|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	Yes.|`|Br0Y1kW7aa	well if the 16 year old is over 16 then its legal|`|IOyMlOLKaa	somebody would go too jail|`|tu6c53Vmaa	just use a condom.|`|Du84mgPZaa	lol im 14 and i have had sex no one got in trouble lol cause we kept it a secret|`|V2r0HRKjaa	He could be but not if no one else knows or she doesn't get pregnant!|`|OxoumjYJaa	Yes the 18 year old could.  Now if they we 17 and 18 then no. Depending on how close they are to their Birth-day.|`|e5O7hQb8aa	technically it is illegal. but he would only get arrested if you told the police that it was against your will, or you told some one who did not agree with it and they could file it as statutory rape.|`|nazzGsspaa	It is legal and no one would go to jail because it isn't profitability  but the 16 years old should wait another 2 years if she is female because she may have healthy problems|`|FERfSYtzaa	I BELIEVE THEY CAN BECAUSE IT'S ONLY RAPE IF THE 16 YEAR SAYS IT IS OTHER THAN THAT IT'S FINE. AND NO THE 18 YEAR OLD WON'T GET ARRESTED . NOW YOU SEE IF IT WAS A 16 YEAR WITH A 25 YEAR OLD THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM.|`|HWtG9dkzaa	It depends on where you live - and the law of the state/country.    I know, if you live in the UK - you're fine, as the legal age of consent is 16. I'm pretty sure that its the same in most Ameican states as well... but I don't know for certain.|`|AA11606210	Be careful. Look up the laws in your state. You may be of consentual age, but if not, definitely be careful. Your parents would have the right to press charges. And, be careful about getting pregnant. You don't need that at your age, or his. Look up natural family planning. And use protection every time.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	16 is the age of concent so no the 18 yrold can not get in trouble.|`|EBkGtGjDaa	its possible if anyone press charges on the 18, i would most likely sat its illegal (any thing sexual until the 16 is 18)    just to be safe:    MOST IMPORTANT read THIS and TALK BEFORE sex:    1. what protection would do you plan to use?    2. do you know that protection is not a 100% and can fail? BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING!    3. would you make you partner use protection?     4. what would you do if someone got pregnant or you got an std?    5. you do know it only takes once to get pregnant or get std?    here is a list to make sure ready:    1. when BOTH 100% ready mentally, physically, and emotionally    2, your NOT doing it to prove anything, or to keep someone.    3.you know all the myths about sex, you know all the facts about sex, you know about all the protect how effective they are and what would be best for you.    4. you know all the pros and con and will to take the responsibility for what could happen.    5. you keep learning about sex: http://plannedparenthood.org and http://sexinfo101.com    e-mail me if you have any questions    I'm 19 a virgin ( god damn proud of it) with my bf (virgin too) dating for 11 months and no sex
Pf9fyEyQaa	I got a free diaper backpack and formula when I signed up with Nestle Baby.  I've also signed up for things like enfamil and such for free cans of formula.  I plan on breastfeeding for at least 3 months but these cans last over a year before going bad, so now I have them just in case.  I have also gotten free diaper samples from Huggies, Costco, etc.|`|6JvAjG5kaa	This has a huge list of places you can sign up:    http://www.ehow.com/how_4680445_baby-stu...|`|a485e8f533a15dc3cc9e66f068f78342aa	Just sign up with all the brands websites, thats what I did.  Huggies, Pampers, Luvs, Enfamil, Similiac, etc....  I get diaper samples & coupons once a month and every 3mths I get a can of formula from one of them. I dont use the formula so I give it to a friend and give her the coupons too.|`|dOeE9GCcaa	If you live in the states you can go to pampers.com..  Unfortunately for me I live in Canada and they dont do that stuff for Canadians. Depending on which formula you use you have to go to that website and they usually send you a days worth of formula
oXzHvsBpaa	It could be a few things. A heat rash. Most likely its baby acne. The best thing for it is Aquafor. My son had the same problem. It was all over his face, chest and arms. The Aquafor worked great. It helped.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	heat rash or milk rash, can use olive oil or baby lotion. my daughter has them and i find behind her ears is where milk dribbles when she nurses and also if she falls asleep on my skin she gets a sweaty side of her head and gets the heat rash. also could be hormones.|`|SDjrojZXaa	it sounds like baby acne and they are common in newborns...they should disapear on there own....i would avoid any lotion on the face because that can clog the pores more. and be sure to keep the face clean|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Prickly heat rash. A&D ointment works fine.|`|dOeE9GCcaa	Sounds like baby acne. Its normal all babies get it. I just washed my daughters face once a day with a warm facecloth and then dried her off. Hers only lasted about a month but some babies acne lasts up until 6 months. You pretty much just have to wait it out. Dont pick at them and keep her face dry and clean.|`|y3HLL203aa	I have a 5 week old son and he has the same thing on his face.  I asked his doctor about it and she said that it was just baby acne the best thing to do is clean his face with pure water, no lotions or creams, they will only make it worse, the acne will resolve itself with time.
d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	YEAH KNOW SOMETHING IF YOU YELL AT YOUR BABY LIKE YOU YELL HERE SHE IS DEAF SORRY TO BREAK THE NEWS TO YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|VS8mactUaa	Shes 4 months old, calm down and breathe, she is much to young to reply on demand. She passed the hearing test after all. Im sure shes fine, :) Stop worrying lol.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Make an appointment with her doctor and get it checked out.|`|AA11369432	You may need to have her hearing checked.|`|tcPaHzkUaa	She is four months shes not gonna be paying attention.so its perfectly normal.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I don't want to freak you out more, but I'm going to anyway. Have you thought to have her checked for autism. I don't know much about when it starts manifesting, but I do know that behaviors like the one you described can be a possible sign of it. I'm not a doctor though so you should take her in to get checked out.|`|vi177FW2aa	Yea, probably deaf.  But maybe she doesn't like you?|`|bfP8tjPKaa	She might just be interested in whatever she may be looking at. Relax, everything should be fine, normally babies do not respond to direction until 5 1/2 to 7 months...|`|YhjFiVGyaa	she is just used to your voice and still doesnt understand commands to pay attention. try leaving her alone in the room a few minutes, then come back in and call for her...she might answer.  she knows ur presence and doesnt feel the need to respond to ur voice. now if u were screaming and making ruckes she may look to see what the commotion is about, but simple talking, i wouldnt worry about it.  learn to get used to this cuz they ignore twice as bad as soon as they hit 5 years old looool|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	Try the startle test. When she cannot see you, make a sudden loud noise, like clapping your hands or beating a spoon on a pan's lid. If she does not react, make an appointment to see her pediatrician.|`|dcd11iUwaa	i wouldn't worry about it honey, some kids are slower to develop recognition and cognitive skills.  Maybe she is used to your voice and doesn't feel the need to look at you as you are speaking in a non threatening way.  One way to test it is to drop a dish or something really loud on the floor and watch how she responds.   good luck and im sure everything is fine,x|`|RvddYKqjaa	Your baby needs an assessment by a qualified ENT and audiologist. My daughter is an audiologist and she says that so many babies could be helped if their parents would do just what you did, and test them to see if they can hear. Sometimes it's very minor and can be helped by tubes in the ear. Please see a medical person and have her hearing checked professionally. Doing it right now will save you a lot of worry over what "might" be happening. Try dropping a big book on the floor and see if there is a response. Ring a bell. They are different frequencies. See what she might respond to. EDIT: Newborns can be tested very effectively. Your 4-month should be responding to noise.|`|FP8Avd3oaa	First off being deaf is not heritary. Secondly, if her back is turned to you and you talk to her the child is not goind to be able to turn that far. If you very concerned take her back and have to ear test redone.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I would for sure call the doctor and make an apt. It cant hurt to check things out. So call today , that will make you feel much better.    Also my 4 month old gets distracted very easily although he will usually turn when he hears me. But sometimes I try tickling his face to get his focus on me or singing a song!|`|qfsVYQMraa	MAYBE YOU'VE TURNED HER DEAF FROM ALL THE SHOUTING THAT YOU DO      The only thing you can do to relax yourself is to go and get another hearing test done.    Good luck :)|`|9p1TFjmPaa	i think she is too small...  maybe it's because of distractions...|`|wX5xoAN8aa	I w-would answer b-b-but you s-scared me with your -s-s-shouting.... *scared*|`|OzslGLjAaa	call your pediatricians nursing station, at the very least and see what they say.  I am a stay at home father of 2 very young children, and I know from experience that when you get worked up about something, sometimes you just end up scaring yourself too much.  You should just call your pediatrician and tell them what's going on.|`|nCBdJkbEaa	The baby is 4 months old.. what do you want from her?    Every child grows up differently.  I'm sure she's not deaf.  I just think you're making a big deal out of it.|`|dJc7kTwUaa	well i know alot about babies and she is only 4 months she is still growing she learns things at her own pace u might want to take her to a family Doctor she could have a hear infection .|`|5DJcir9saa	Its probably because she doesn't realize that you're talking to her and she is distracted by something else.  A could way to test if your baby can hear is to shake a rattle to one side of her head, where she can't see it, then see if she turns to find out where the noise is coming from.  Then do it on the other side to check that ear.  I had the same fear one day because my baby would not respond to my voice, but he was just distracted!
Kg5KX432aa	yes. Anytime I watch the news or anything about a child that is being hurt or neglected, it makes me cry. Don't worry, there is a special place in hell for people like that.
Dhsyroekaa	its letting you know your period is coming
356f8f209dcd6dc30f57b5bcaa4830f6aa	I would not advise any woman to smoke during pregnancy, but I did smoke while pregnant.  Wish that I could have stopped, but all I could do was cut back.  At least I did try.  Anyway, this is a little info I found on the internet.  As for your friend I don't think smoking had anything to do with her problems.  Here is the article I located:  Theoretically, smoking could cause a miscarriage in a number of ways. In the early days of pregnancy when the baby develops so quickly, cigarette smoke may cause genetic damage in the baby. Chromosomal problems are the most common cause of miscarriages, so its theoretically possible that heavy exposure to cigarette smoke could be a cause. Smoking could also change the lining of the uterus to make it harder for the fertilized egg to implant.     If you are wondering how the fathers smoking could affect miscarriages, the answer may lie in the sperm. A few studies have found that men who smoke heavily tend to have increased incidence of sperm with chromosomal abnormalities, and again, chromosomal abnormalities in the developing baby are the most common cause of miscarriages. The answer could also be that the father's smoking causes the mother to be around secondhand smoke, which could theoretically cause problems in the mother's ability to maintain the pregnancy. Future studies will hopefully reveal the exact mechanism behind this link.     Other studies have found an even stronger link between smoking and miscarriages when looking only at miscarriages where the baby was chromosomally normal, however, so the reason why smoking increases miscarriage risks may have nothing to do with chromosmal issues and could have more to do with something else, such as the placenta having a diminished capacity to transport oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Research indicates that later in pregnancy, smoking does appear to decrease the placentas ability to deliver nutrients to the developing baby. In addition to potentially causing miscarriages, this can cause babies to be born with lower birthweight and can also increase the risk of stillbirth, as well as death in the first year of life.     Different studies find different exact figures to indicate the risks of smoking and miscarriage, but regardless of the exact numbers and exact mechanism, quitting smoking or avoiding cigarette smoke is one of the few miscarriage risk factors that you can control. If you smoke and had a past miscarriage, it is impossible to say whether smoking caused your loss or whether it will cause a future miscarriage or stillbirth, but quitting will definitely do you and your future child a favor.|`|780ByZVEaa	i smoked with both of mine until i found out at 8 weeks they are healthy|`|627pWyVkaa	Smoking is linked to miscarriages :S. however there are also other things like problems with cervix, placenta, falling, birth defects, and some are just unknown.    edit-heres a website that explains it and other possible causes  http://www.babycenter.ca/pregnancy/grief...|`|3cLWlMQxaa	Yes it can. Smoke contains carbon monixide that starves cells of oxygen, including the cells to your baby. It's basically poisoning the baby. Smoke contains 4000 cancer causing chemicals and if smoking a lot the baby is alive he/she could have a chance of getting cancer later in life.    But there are many causes of miscarriage.|`|wkK5JDz4aa	YES!!!!|`|nbSp469Waa	Smoking a lot can cause miscarriages, but in your friends case, I think she lost her's due to incompetent cervix.

nf35HjdVaa	I know how you feel about not being ready to be a mom! I was 21 a senior in college, and only engaged for like 5 months. My now husband is 6 years older than me, however I was only 21, now 23. I was scared because there was so much I wanted to do and places I anted to see. I did not have a great mother, she was addicted to drugs and my step father was no better. Needless, to say I did not have good examples of how to be a mom. I as scared that I would damage this baby the same way I felt damaged by my mother. There was no doubt that I was going to have this baby nor would my fiance let me give it for adoption. I knew that I wanted the baby but was scared on how to raise it. Until I felt her move for the first time. Then I realized I have the control and the power to be the one person that she can ALWAYS count on. I can help her be succcessful and grow into a beautiful young women! You're situation is different because the father is not involved. However, if you want to be a mother to this baby, there is nothing that will hold you back! I am proud to say I AM A GREAT MOTHER!!!  My daughter is one and walks to me and just gives me big hugs and kisses and all of those fears just go away!    Adoption is a choice but it should be yours and yours alone. Be sure you research, research, research, the family you are going to give this precious child to, if that is what you decide!    I am now pregnant with my 2nd child and I am 17 weeks. when I found out I was scared and a bit ashamed, I am 23 with 2 babies! Luckily my husband is super supportive and I have a career as a teacher! Take your time, you have a big decision to make! Good luck and ask God for the right direction! He'll lead you there! I know he did me!|`|lo4mp9zTaa	OK - I was 19 when i got pregnant however I had been married for a while before i got pregnant, so it's different and i unerstand that. but i was still young and still unsure. I am now 22 and my son is 2 and my family is wonderful. We can now finacially support a child and actually would like to adopt ourselves. See, my husband was adopted when he was 3 days old. and his mom and dad tried for so long to have a baby and couldn't so they started their desperate search for a baby and fianlly found my husbdans birht mother that was 17 and pregnant and looking to adopt him. My husbands parents are so awesome. They're loving, supportive and caring. They instilled in him christianity  and love for god. and he was o thankful to be adopted. Recently he got in contact with his birth mother and he has had the absolute most respect for her because he was raised knowing he was adopted and knowing the his biological mother gave him to them because she loved him so much. We are actually planning on meeting them this may. Anyhow - Adoption is always a GREAT option. but there are many single mothers out there. You have to really find out what's best for you and most of all what will be best for that little baby growing inside of you. My husband take online classes through Mountain state university and works at our business full time and he's still a wonderful father. mommies do it all the time. Take online classes. If you find a school like my husband did the degree is 100% the same as if her were going and riving there everyday. Just get a sitter during the times that you work and do your school work after the little one goes to bed. my husband does that. Again, you just have to find out what's best for you. I hope this helps. I'm sure you'll make the right decision for your baby. I know you care for the baby but when you actually bring your child in the world, try to be prepared because it's instant love and sometimes everything that you may have planned will all disappear because you just fall head over heels in love with your baby. . . . .good luck and prayers.|`|yOyg3gnJaa	I think that you need to accept the fact that you are pregnant, and rationally think about what you want to do.  I personally applaud you for wanting to give the baby a chance at life, and not having an abortion.  Adoptions aren't all bad, there are always going to be horror stories, unfortunately there are also horror stories with women who have babies and keep them and don't take care of them properly.  If you didn't want anything to happen to you to "cramp your lifestyle", then honestly, you should have taken better precaution with having unprotected sex.  Sit down and talk to a counselor about your options, and they will help you find out the best way to go about this situation.  And no more unprotected sex.  Get on some birth control for crying out loud.  Oh, and why are you sleeping with people UNPROTECTED that you want nothing to do with a few months later?  That is irrational.  Good luck.|`|rcdTluUjaa	No one is ready to be a mom when they get pregnant. However those feelings generally change during pregnancy. If you get closer to your due date and feel the same way, then adoption is a wonderful option. I know 3 couples that have adopted and they love their children like they were biologically theirs, and with 2 of the couples the kids already know they were adopted and don't have any problems with it. I also know several girls that put their babies up for adoption and don't regret it. With the option of open adoption most of the time you can still be involved in your childs life, Only you can make this decision, but give it some time, and see if you still feel the same way in a couple of months. Good luck|`|xnhwmontaa	Ur going to have to deal with this...because of your mistakes...I had my first baby at 17...I am almost done with my degree...you'll be fine... mothering comes natural as soon as that baby hit your arms....its an instinct..i cant explain it ......its like you already know how to do it...|`|G5Ut9prSaa	It's quite normal for you to worry that you won't be able to provide and care for the baby as someone else would be. And it's quite normal, for all first time mothers, to not be ready to have a baby when they find out they are pregnant, and that they won't be a good mother. However, you'll never regret having a baby. Never. A baby is a life changing, life altering experience, and life. However, you should think carefully as to whether you can really care for this baby, or whether you are just over reacting thinking you can't (that's normal in pregnancy). There are a lot of adoptions that turn out fantastic. But you need to decide what's going to be best for you and your baby. You never know, maybe you're family will be really supportive and help you through it.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	If you don't think you can handle the baby then I would contact some adoption groups, both public and private and explore the options, get all the facts and then make a decision. Make a pro and con list of keeping the baby vs. giving it up for adoption. No one can tell you what you should do, it needs to come from your heart and you have to be 100% sure of your decision so there are no regrets. Good luck to you and your baby no matter what you choose!     A friend of mine adopted a little boy. She and her husband couldn't have kids of their own so they adopted and they love that boy so much and have giving him such a good, normal life so there are good things to adoption, they don't always have a bad outcome. There are also many single young mother's out there who have still finished school and were able to provide a good life for their baby as well so having a baby doesn't mean you can't go to school.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	wow!! i understand how you feel. i am in the same situation also. I am also 19 and well at first i was really worried about the same issues you're dealing with and still am. i know that it was my mistake by not using protection and im in a whole big mess but i know that this baby did not ask to come and so i have to make the best of it. i think you should start thinking wisely about what you really want to do. i  know that maybe the thought of putting the baby for adoption so you can do what you want in your life seems great, but i think it's kinda selfish. no offense. i thought about it at the beginning too. i think you can do and accomplish the same stuff having your baby. i mean, it's part of you!!! you'll have someone to fight and be strong for. don't you see that? what about in the future?? you might regret it. maybe not now, but you never know. this baby deserves the best and i know that only a mother can give the real love any baby needs.     just think about it. there are so many girls that do it. it's okay.|`|9TfKeq9Eaa	Honestly you should have thought about all of this before you had unprotected sex. It sounds like adoption would be the best move for you. You can find a family that you are comfortable placing your baby with. This way you know they will be going to a good home. I hope in the future you will take the proper precautions to prevent pregnancy if you are not ready for it. Good luck and I hope everything works out for you.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Every one has these thought. Especially 1st time moms. I know I have those thoughts about not being the best mother & wondering if I can really do this. But I always reassure my self that when this baby gets here every thing will change. But you are only 19 & single. Im going to be 22, im married with a house & a great job so there is a little difference there. Its too late to turn back now your already pregnant & have to face the consequences of your actions. Either suck it up & be the best mom you can possibly be or give the baby to a good home.|`|fZgqzPSNaa	My opinion- I guarantee you will not regret having or keeping this child. They are so much fun and well worth the time. You should get plenty of support from family and friends and you may receive several grants from your school for being a single mom. Im not going to lie it will be challenging, but well worth it. However, if you honestly feel that your 100% not CAPABLE of having a child don't be afraid of adoption there are a lot of options out there and support groups. Check out some support groups within your community and college they will have great advice as well. Good luck and best wishes.|`|prq0Y1Jaaa	Hi,sorry for your situation, if your not ready to be a mom and don't think you will be by the time the baby is born,adoption sounds like the best option, you could have an open adoption. Don't make any decisions yet a pregnancy lasts for a while and you don't want to end up regretting your decision. Having a baby doesn't end your life makes some of it harder but all the same it is so rewarding. Lots of woman feel resentful of the life inside of them it's normal. You don't know how you will feel once you see your baby for the first time. Good luck
G5Ut9prSaa	This hasn't happened to me, but I've heard of it happening before. It's not uncommon to not test positive until in the second trimester with a HPT. Talk to your doctor and (s)he'll be able to reassure you. I'm sure though that everything will be alright, you were taking quite a low dose of clomid.|`|8e7ZxOL1aa	i heard 64 percent get the periods when preg its just not taked abiuut that much u should b fine if it has a cycle other wise see ya doc
Cqgv9Wx1aa	take some new little toys for on the plane and give her a new one every hour or so to keep her entertained. try not to feed her till you are in the air as this will also kill some time. crayons and paper are always good too.|`|ekAH05qWaa	i suggest you bring a portable dvd player and bring a couple of movies that she could watch. maybe you could bring like a leapster or something as well...bring as much stuff as you can to keep her occupied!
Fsr2Rofzaa	lol, no it just means you are one of many who can't take those pills.  I had to take flintstones with folic acid and iron.  Ask your doc if this may work for you.  I would vomit everytime I took the prenat. vit. so that is what my OB told me to do.  It worked for me.|`|fE5zMOfJaa	You should get some prenatal vitamins from your dr.  The ones I bought from the store made me sick too & my dr. prescribed me so that are slow releasing so they are much easier on the stomach.  And I take them right before bed.|`|0722e5ddd4c6c3cb4e310338f3c85935aa	well you have a 50 50 chance! You can try taking Flintstones vitamins, my dr. told me to try the chewy ones and they do not make me ill.|`|wHOQXToHaa	No- it's half & half chance. I was SOOOOOO sick with my first pregnancy and couldnt take my vitamins the 1st trimester- ended up having a 100% all boy baby! I'm in my 2nd pregnancy @ 20 weeks and have my ultrasound in 3 days- I have been SO incredibly sick even thru the 2nd trimester, cant wait to see what we're having! Some people get sick in all their pregnancies- some people never get sick. Best wishes!|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	No.      You might have a girl because its a 50/50 chance. There is no real way to tell what you're having (except ultrasounds/chromosome testing of course). Everything else is an "old wives' tale."|`|vqbmcg4Paa	no it doesn`t mean you might have a girl. talk to your dr maybe you need a different type of vitamins.gluck and congrats|`|iwYu32N2aa	no? Im having a girl and my prenatal don't make me sick|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	No it means that you have bad morning sickness and you should change the time you take your prenatal vitamins    --take it an hour before bed with food|`|627pWyVkaa	it just means your morning sickness is making it hard for you to take your medications, I have the same problems. I try to get them from food and drinks with them in it instead. and taking medication to help with it so i can take it more often|`|BTCtT6edaa	Yes, it does mean you might have a girl. Or you might have a boy.
Fsr2Rofzaa	i am not a doctor, but I am sorry but that is what happened to me when I had a miscarriage at 10 weeks|`|Jswomud7aa	You should go to the doctor right away. If you are miscarrying there is nothing they can do to stop it, but they can explain to you what is happening and if you take a small sample of what is coming out they can test it for fetal tissue.    My sister-in-law thought she was miscarrying and went to the doctors with a sample of what came out. It did have fetal tissue but when they did an ultrasound there was still a baby in there... She was pregnant with twins and only one of them miscarried!!!     Go to the doctor!|`|XCueIYnYaa	You may want to speak to a doctor. It doesnt sound good  Best of Luck|`|sEihaeLNaa	im sorry but that sound like a MC i would go to the doc and get checked out.|`|AA11795652	There's nothing they can do if you're having a miscarriage.  Did they explain to you what was going on?  If not, then go see another doctor who will take the time to explain what is happening.|`|8lchebCNaa	U SHOULD GO TO YOUR DOCTOR NOT JUST AN E.R.  THATS SCARY.. HURRY!|`|lPgwZzoWaa	HECK YES!!!!!  NOW!!!|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	Did you have a positive preg test?      If you are not sure if you are pregnant, then it could be a m/c or it could just be a heavy period from missing a month.|`|3CG3rby0aa	call your doctor and see what they say.  Because if you have had a miscarriage then they will want to check you out and make sure that everything is clean and nothing is left over.  I am sorry to hear that!  Good luck and God bless!|`|F0kjf1j8aa	I would get  a second opinion ,if you were pregnant and had a miscarriage the hormone will still be in your body and a test will tell you, with all the bleeding I think you were and if so you will need a d&C to clean you out so you don't get sick  I would go to another dr or the er right away
P2hhUsoMaa	I think it all depends on your employer.  I know I have worked at the same place for 6+ years and with my first pregnancy 3 years ago I was told to pick when I wanted my leave to start.  So I did and it was 3 weeks before I was due.  Which was a bad idea, since my daughter was 4 weeks early, but it all worked out.  My second pregnancy a few months ago I was told to give my doctor the paperwork and they were supposed to decided when I started my leave.  I still picked the date and wrote it on the paper and the doctor signed it.  As long as you dont have complications you should be able to work until the week before your due.  But I would say if you want to know how to go about the whole process you need to talk to Human resources.  Especially since it seems like your supervisors don't know the real answer or they both wouldn't have said something different.  Good LUck!|`|qFvHH6lUaa	I think that it's between you and your employer as long as you have the vacation and sick time to cover your leave.  But it's different if you're using short term disability.  If you're getting the disability through work, have them explain it to you.  But that all changes if you are medically ordered to stop work to be put on bed rest or something similar.  Good luck.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	If you are using fmla or a short herm disability plan you will have to wait until you actually go into labor. If you are using vacation time you can go any time you want as long as you have enough to cover until you go into labor and fmla/disability kicks in.    The only exception is when you have a medical reason to leave earlier.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Thats not a question for your supervisors, take it to your HR rep.
YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|l9jtfrU4aa	Sounds like you could be. But the only way to know for sure is go buy a test and pee on a stick. If it comes up positive then go to your doctor and talk with him about it.   Hope this helps,  -Pandora-|`|gZsQBT8Taa	The best thing to do is to go and see your doctor. He will give you the correct answer.|`|ViZUiEgxaa	it could be anything. if u have an excessive (alot) of stress in your life lately it effects your period. if you have been around alot of women lately, like if you live with even two other women or you hang out with your female friends alot or even your sisters, that effects your period as well. consider the things that are going on in your life, anything could effect your period. if u think that things are the same as they have always been but your period is still acting up, make an appointment with your gynocologist, he/she should be able to tell u if you're pregnant, or what else it could be. Hope this is helpful.
gwuTKiNXaa	you could have just tested to early. possibly could have been implantation bleeding
wqRSMSlLaa	A mother with postpartum psychosis should NEVER be left alone or left alone with her child(ren) until she is stable.  She should not even be alone in the bathroom without the door open.  The truth is, she cannot be trusted with her baby - she is a good person and a good mother, but psychosis can make a mother do things she would never ordinarily do.  She is not in our reality, and you never know what voices she is hearing, directions she's hallucinating, and so on.  She should spend time with the baby if she's able, but never alone. Safety - hers and the baby's - is much too important.    Dr. Shoshana Bennett|`|oTwymgpIaa	That is a hard question to answer. Any reasonable person would say the safety of the child is the priority over how the mother feels about it. She would feel a lot worse if she caused harm to the child. The problem is I don't feel the government belongs in the family. Our government has legalized abortion, yet at the same time created ridiculous laws in an attempt to show concerns for the welfare of children who are given a chance at life. For instance, any type of physical altercation with a child is considered abusive, even in self defense, but it isn't abusive to snuff a child out as long as it is still in the womb. This has created a society where few parents can maintain control of their children. Yet, when the child misbehaves the parent is blamed even though they have no power to discipline. For instance, I know a mother whos daughter is twice her size, she is the sweetest woman you could know, but her daughter has this problem with hitting her and slamming her into walls, well one day the mother got tired of being beat on so she pushed her daughter down. The daughter called the cops on her and cried abuse, and the mother was threatened with jail time if she ever defended herself again. Once most kids hit puberty they become unreasonable and rebellious and often it is necessary for you to use physical force in order to protect the child from destroying themselves. It isn't that I don't think that laws shouldn't exist to protect children, the problem is when you give power to the government the above is exactly what happens. I have had CPS called on me twice, and both times it was done by a disgruntled person who was attempting to destroy me by getting at my family not because there was a problem. This is what happens when the government is replaced by the parent. I feel if the majority of people in this society support murdering unborn children, they have no right to intervene with those who have enough love to give life to their child and they should shut the f*ck up and mind their own buisness. If our government and society is so selfish and callous they would murder an unborn child, why the hell would anyone in their right mind think they should have the right to dictate rules and laws to those who choose to give their children life? You can't murder the innocent then turn around and claim concern for them. ;-)|`|5NhartQ3aa	Do you or a friend suffer from this?  You need to seek help from your local Health Department for some resources.  You have an obligation to look out for the baby who may be in danger.  This requires medical treatment and most likely counselling.  Please look out for that precious baby!!!
nFqfUVPJaa	As a female who uses tampons, I do not put them into the garbage..I do not know any women who do... were they used? She may have had an early miscarriage or some women do spot during pregnancy.   You are correct in thinking her behavior is suspicious. You need to sit her down and talk, maybe she thinks you will be mad at her if she is not pregnant or lost the baby. Are you still having sex? If so she could be hoping to get pregnant soon enough that you won't be able to tell?     Any way you cut it you two need to talk, whether she thinks she isn't high risk or not is not hers to decide. If she is pregnant she needs to be seen.     Good Luck|`|AA10186411	She probably isn't really pregnant.  She could have gotten someone else to pee on the stick, or could have left it out long enough to get a n evaporation positive.  She sounds like a retard.|`|xnhwmontaa	She needs to go for the baby not for herself...|`|fE5zMOfJaa	She's probably scared to death not to mention super hormonal because she is pregnant.  But it is very important that she goes to the dr.  How does she know she's not high-risk?  And anyways...that doesn't matter.  Or maybe there's something she's not telling you.  You just need to tell her she needs to talk to you.  Don't get mad at her because that will only push her away more.  Be as understanding as you can & make her feel like you are really there to support her & help her.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	It isnt' uncommon to miscarry really early in a pregnancy.  I've read that most women miscarry before they even know that they're pregnant.  Could she have lost the baby and not told you about it?  Maybe that's why she's pushing you away and 3 months is enough time for her to get her period back on schedule.  I'm not sure how you should approach her but I'd ask.  Be really sensitive either way.  And if that has happened and she hasn't been to a doctor, she needs to go.  Sometimes not everything gets passed and that can lead to a nasty infection.|`|YhjFiVGyaa	wait...wtf up with the tampons? were they used or just in there?  there is a number of things that could have gone down.  maybe she had an abortion and didnt tell u.  maybe she hada a friend pee on the stick and she is trying to keep you buy playing the baby card.  if she is asking if u have another girl, maybe she cheated and the baby isnt urs? usually the cheater is the accuser.    but really if the tampons are hers, she may have aborted and not told u. she dont want to see the doc cuz she knows she isnt prego anymore.|`|5X6C4s7zaa	there could be several explanation for her behavior....either she lied about being pregnant in the first place or she lost the baby and is afraid to tell you and see the doctor or she is afraid that she might be losing the baby and doesn't want to deal with it.  Since you are positive that she was pregnant in the first place than it is one of the last two.  In this case you should just be patient with her, don't push her or pressure her to answer your questions or to go to the doctor if she is not ready.  Losing a baby is a VERY difficult thing and you can only be making it worse if you are accusing her of cheating or getting on her case about not going to the doctor.  Let her know that you are there for her and that when SHE is ready to go to the doctor you will be there for her.  Only time will tell what the real truth is in all of this, I hope it all turns out for the best:)|`|f4Nv0yBdaa	maybe she miscarried and is scared to go to the doctor about it. idk why else there would be tampons in her trash unless theres some other girls living with her. and since shes asking if you have another girl on the side maybe she thinks a baby will keep you closer to her. idk thats just what i think.|`|jTJNOUMwaa	maybe she miscarried and is afraid to tell you?|`|NNwEuC8paa	Ok  first question is, where the tampons used? Also when you are pregnant you are really emotional, so she could just be thinking all this horrible stuff in her head bc her mind is all over the place and if she really is pregnant she's scared and doesn't want to loose you. Also she needs to go to the doctors. That is really selfish of her she needs needs to take folic acid, so be eating right. if she's not the baby could have many problems. You need to sit her down and speak to her make sure that she understands how important a baby is and how important the baby is to you.|`|jk6ayFUmaa	maybe she miscarried and is scared to telll you?
YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    To take a test and have it be accurate, you need to follow the directions exactly. If it says 5 days before your expected period, then wait until 5 days before you expect your period.|`|XCueIYnYaa	It may be too early, Its only been a week and half since you had sex, you may be pregnant but the 1st 2 weeks are just implantation, your HCG levels really may not be high enough to detect a pregnancy.  Just wait it out.  Best of Luck|`|AA10186411	You said way too much for me to even comprehend.  But heres the best method to testing.  19 days after you had sex.  If you ovulated late, then 5 days before your missed period could give you a false negative. Just wait 19 days after you had sex.  Simple.|`|X2G8EHBlaa	NO! no you cant get a positive on a pregnancy test that early...it'd have to be at least four or five weeks before you could get a positive|`|ApHLa19Faa	Just take a test. If it is negative and your period still hasn't shown up in a few days, take another one. I know it's hard to wait but it's all you can do.
lYsrCTCwaa	I think your mother will have all the time in the world to see her grandchild. You're only in the hospital for a couple days. I would want my mother to be comfortable the 1st time she sees my children. I think you should just accept this, and like you said, it's just for one day:)|`|It1cgrVwaa	wow.. swallow your pride.. that's just messed up|`|ce4b535ba7b008940070f2af3b9db2fbaa	Sorry but as much as you want it to be all about you and your new baby, maybe your mother is really affected by this, she probably doesn't mean to hurt your feelings. When you get home from the hospital and you are feeling up to it then take your baby to your mothers house. My mother in law couldn't walk very good and she never even got to hold her grandbabies let alone go to the hospital.|`|wOc5cInNaa	Hmm...I would totally swallow my pride and go see my new grandchild or so I think I would...We all think we'd do one thing now but nobody really knows what they would do until they find themselves in that situation.   My baby is 8 weeks old - I would tell you not to worry yourself with this too much. Once your little one is born - you won't care anyway - it will be all about your baby and no one else!!! Congrats!!!|`|ay8tXLD2aa	I would not push my mother if I was in that situation. In fact, for me, it was a struggle to get people to BACK OFF and leave me alone while I was in the hospital.  Your baby will be asleep, you will have the baby's father, any other children you have, and probably loads of other visitors.  It's most likely only 24 hours in the hospital anyway - let your mother visit you when you get home, where she is more comfortable.|`|8026ec062aaa229b35c5aceb76a16035aa	Think of it this way - she isn't hurting anyone but herself. You will be there with your new baby, and the baby won't even know she exists at that moment. She will be the one missing out.     However in her situation I would like to think that I would deal with my issues later because seeing my new grandchild would be so much more important.     My grandmother has mobility issues as well and actually fell on her way to visit me and broke her leg - so in this case I completely understood and took the baby to see her after we left hospital. But if it had been a pride issue strictly I would not have made the trip to show the baby to her, she could come see him when she was ready.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My mother also has mobility problems, and yes, sometimes her pride gets in the way when we want her to do things.  That said, there's no easier place for a person with mobility issues to travel than inside a hospital!  They're built for that, basically.    But, if she really feels strongly about it, I wouldn't push.  The baby is here for good, after all and she can see him for the first time in conditions that make her comfortable, the day he gets home from the hospital.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Well I can kind of relate to her...I went from being perfectly healthy to suddenly having arthritis in my hip and foot, and could not walk at all.  And yes I wouldnt go anywhere because I was embarrassed that I couldnt walk, i didnt want help from anyone, not even a wheelchair because i didnt want attention on me....but then i realized no one was paying attention to me lol ....but if it came to seeing my grandchildren, yes I would swallow my pride and go see the baby.  Just keep trying to talk to her maybe she will change her mind.   Tell her she has no reason to be embarrassed, people are not going to be talking about her because she needs help! good luck!|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	There would be no pride for me to swallow. Walking troubles comes along with getting old and I've accepted that (even though I'm only 23). But absolutely nothing would stop me from getting to an important family event, such as a child being born.|`|0MhJOP6xaa	how long do you plan to stay in hospital?  I think its perfectly acceptable for your mother to visit you at home.  I only stayed one night, and had everyone come visit me at home, much more comfy!|`|qStmw7qgaa	My father in law has major heart problems, and when he has to walk a long distance he has a hard time breathing...but when I had my daughter...nothing was going to stop him from seeing her.  She is his first grand baby...and even if she were his 10th...he would be there.  My parents are the same way.  If I were in your shoes, I would be really hurt too.
cypZ0ykXaa	congratulations!! symptoms of pregnancy & periods will b almost same. but positive result will b shown when its really positive.i had cramps & severe lower back pain immediate after a positive result shown. but i got scared &  consulted the doc.she said its absolutely normal.few people have it. its better to consult teh doc as every women is diff in pregnancy."good luck dear"|`|cb5c699472c5114ed99da5404a38ca3faa	If you pregnancy test is positive then your pregnant. You are just having common symptoms of pregnancy.|`|HDqPQbxtaa	its tough to wait it out, and the symptoms of preggers and your period are all almost identical. try if you can to wait til you period is due to take a test, youll get more accurate results that way! im waiting right now too, i hate it! ill keep my fingers crossed for us! baby dust?|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Its so RARE to have false positives. Its much easier to have false negatives. I say you are full blown pregnant, and you have a very high HCG level for the test to pick it up this early. Congrats and start acting like a new pregnant mom. Run out get some prenatal vitamins. NO more caffiene or smoking or drinking and schedule a doc appointment in 8 weeks or so.!!! Good luck|`|oX4mg0ghaa	congrats!!!!!! my test told me about 1 and a half weeks b4 I was due for A.F.  You will feel better soon then worse then better lol its just normal, anyways good luck!!!!!!|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	well hun....it soundds like you're PREGNANT!!!! CONGRATS!!! Go to the doctor to be sure! :)
jaAolejUaa	im a mom and to be honest i would only know how i react when that happens. frankly what i would say now may be different  from what ill really do|`|AA11210211	I would be all kinds of things,angry,upset,sad,disappointed but I wouldn't turn my back on her.|`|WqsJf4kgaa	I wouldn't be angry, I'd be disappointed and upset that my daughter hadn't taken precautions when having sex. However, I would like to think that I would help her throughout, and help her make a decision on whether to have an abortion or keep the baby.  Remeber that at 14 years old, you are still considered a child, and it is difficult to support a baby, even with your parents help.|`|ajDohnPIaa	Well...I was 14 and pregnant...So here's a LITTLE of expierence...If you get mad, she won't get upset...and she will think you will get over it soon. But YOU on the other hand.....All you can do is be there for her...You probably have done all you can to not let her make this mistake...but Kids are Kids. and when Kids have Kids...they grow up real quick....and make the decisions on their own....Right now that your daughter is pregnant...she is very scared...and might feel alone.   No matter what she says....Just tell her your not mad...and you know shell be a good mother, and just be there for her! BECAUSE if you are mean and mad at her, Yall's relationship will never be the same =/|`|FVFxE6owaa	I would be very angry, yes, but there isn't much her mom will be able to do.  It's happened and now the baby and your friend need to get the best prenatal care they can.  I think most parents are more disappointed than angry when things like this happen.  Her mother needs to support her, make sure she gets prenatal care, and talk with her about her options (keeping the baby or giving the baby up for adoption).|`|f3LrMhqWaa	i'm not a mom, but i would be upset as i know people who had kids very young, and from then on the child has to come first so their education suffers, unless of course the father is supportive, which happened in one girls' case and he worked while she went to college and they're getting married now.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I'd be upset and disappointed towards my daughter. More angry with the fact that she can't be a teen like she should be able to. If she was pregnant there would be nothing I could do at that point, I would just support her and make sure she takes care of herself so that my grandchild could be healthy and happy. And I would help her out as much as I could once the baby was born.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	I would be scared, for my daughter.  I would be devastated and angry. But it would work out,  because it always does.|`|029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	Sure, probably at first.  As parents, we try to instill good values and teach responsibility, not because it's fun...but because that's our job and we are trying to prepare our kids to be independent and productive when they get on their own.    With that being said...AFTER my daughter would get pregnant I would turn the focus to "What can I help her with now to help her learn an grow from this"...no need to be mad, the deed is done. A child is ALWAYS a blessing and you just have to make the best of the situation...whether she decided to keep her baby or give it up for adoption.    Are you in that situation??|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I would be angry, upset and really disappointed  and worried for her|`|i3pn4jNcaa	you see, this type of thing will never happen to me. because once i find out that my daughter has her period shes going right no the pill.       but for your friend. is the guy there for her? if not & you said youd be there for her then i think you should go with her so she has someone to support her because her mom is going to be very angry. your friend needs to look into heath insurance for young parents & WIC (i dunno if its called that all over but its these checks that are sent to young parents or parent who cant afford the things they need like milk eggs cereal cheese & formula) after she does all this research she should also bring it up to her mom that she was looking into it because it will show her mom that shes being mature about the situation.     & just wait her mom will come around. once her daughter starts to show or when she takes her to her first ultra sound she is going to call in love with the baby inside. everything will be fine for your friend.     good luck :]|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	i would be more worried about your dad because he will yell at you then kill your boyfriend|`|b10aMPdOaa	My daughter is also 14 but not pregnant.  If she came home and told me she was pregnant, I'd obviously be upset and angry, but I would be there for her.|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	Obv, your mums gonna be, disappointed, angry, upset and everything, but she wouldn't turn her back on you. Because at the end of the day - she's your mum, and your her little girl :].|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I wouldn't be angry but I'd be terribly upset.  I would encourage her to terminate the pregnancy.  I wouldn't be taking it lightly and don't like the idea of abortion but I wouldn't want my fourteen year old daughter to be a mother and cut short her childhood and teenage years because she had been foolish.|`|3MEQeHtWaa	I would be very upset and disappointed, but I would need to know the truth to help her out the best I could.|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	Angry and disappointed.|`|Htoc2AISaa	yeah, i'd be pissed.|`|wfsCSU6Aaa	I would be disappointed.  I would say to my daughter...Your a complete dumb ***, way to go.|`|V7wn7W4Kaa	no- you cant put her under that too be disapointed yeh but shes gna need you more than ever. Id just bethere fr her and support any of her desisions.  xxxxxx|`|g5xnXkQkaa	I would be sad for her.  Disappointed but above all she is my daughter and I would do my best to guide her and help her with what ever decision she made|`|qeoOMuV0aa	I'd be more sad than angry.      And I'd definitely be recommending a termination.  Having kids at 27 was difficult enough.|`|swg3BhLXaa	I'd be disappointed and a bit sad, because having a child is a tremendous responsibility. It's even harder to have a baby at such a young age, because you are still trying to get your education and learn things about yourself. BUT, I would do all I could to support you and would never turn my back on you. I would help you to learn how to do certain things and I would try my best to help you to continue your studies, all the way through college.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Disappointed, but what good would anger do in the situation?      I have a 16 year old daughter, so I know what I'm talking about.    I would maybe be a little upset at first from the shock, but then I would calm down and be practical.    Does she want to keep it, has she thought of the options, the implications, her future, the baby, termination; whatever was necessary to proceed.    As I said, I would be bitterly disappointed, but would ask what she wanted to do and try and help her to do the right thing, whatever that was at the time and depending on the circumstances.    Bit pointless being angry, what will that solve?|`|LIrBePulaa	of course i would be angry, upset, disappointed, etc. because the reality of it is...  you're gonna be the one doing most of the work, taking care of the baby and supporting the baby financially.  a 14 yr old is still a child herself in my eyes.|`|fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	i would say i am very disappointed in you but everybody makes mistakes.  your pregnant now so there is nothing we can do about it but i hope you know how much your life is going to change and how much responsibility you will now have.... you better get ur life together because your going to be bring a life into this world and i will not be taking care of your responsibility.|`|5YTWIfFdaa	i would probably go absolutely APE to start with, you know, its the shock of your little girl being pregnant. your initial reaction is to tell her off for being so stupid! and you gotta tell her that. but you also gotta put yourself in her shoes. she is probably sh*ting bricks right now. shes only 14 and shes pregant. she probably has absolutely no idea what to do about it. in her head she is probably just thinking "aw crap..."  you gotta speak to her, give her all her options, is there a boyfriend involved? how does he feel about it? how does SHE feel about it? is she happy? does she want rid? does she know the FULL story behind having a child, bringing it up, plus looking after herself too, mind she is still very young. are there any young mother clinics around where she can talk to other teen mums? communication is essential in circumstances like these. i hope it all goes well x|`|OxoumjYJaa	No. I would try and comfort her cause she would probably be scared to death and then that would ruin your relationship!|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I would feel like a failure. I would be so upset with myself that I didn't teach my daughter all the things that I feel strongly about, like respecting yourself, using protection if/when she decides to make the choice to have sexual relationships, waiting until she is emotionally ready for sexual relationships and not letting boys take advantage of her. But most of all I would be very sad as I would know she would never get to lead the life of a normal teenager and that is a horrible, horrible thing as that is a very vital experience that shapes who you are as a person. She, of course, is my child and I will be there for her and help her through everything but I couldn't help but feel sad.|`|mpOKKyzOaa	My mother would disown me.  I'm 13 and if i ever even thought of getting pregnant she would send me to live with my father.  Although most parents wouldn't. they would be really shocked, embarrassed, annoyed etc. but they will also stick up for you and be supportive, loving, caring, helpful etc.    I think it silly getting pregnant at that age. But I do agree, abortions are disgusting and i would never kill a child because i didn't want it.    Hope this helps.    Good luck with the baby.    XX|`|GByLJCfuaa	no, because my fourteen year old daughter would be educated on sex, abstinence, std' and etc.   bottom line, my fourteen year old daughter WOULD NOT be having sex.|`|IecRl5wMaa	i would be mad at myself for not raising her better. I would just sit down and talk to her about what she did, punish her by making her stay home and watch parenting videos, make her learn to cook and all the other things that being an adult entails. She would have to keep the baby.|`|1iOsKZvIaa	I would be disappointed, however I would support her and tell her about the different choices she has....ie. abortion, keeping it, adoption...
q0JTN9QAaa	Your body can digest and filter anything that is in it like bacteria fungi or infection because you are used to it.  It is filtered before it gets to the baby.    After the baby is born it only has some of the mothers anti bodies but not nearly enough to fend off some of the things in honey.    There are some things you should not eat while pregnat though.|`|uhBkbgoaaa	BECAUSE WHEN YOURE PREGNANT YOUR IMMUNE PROTECTS THE BABY, PLUS IT DOESNT FEED OFF THE MOUTH BUT THE TUBE, AND NEWBORN WILL CHOKE ON THE FOOD LIKKE HNEY CAUSE ITS THICK , I HOPE THAT ANSWERS 4 U|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	The baby doesnt eat the actual food.  It gets the good stuff from it, like the vitamins and proteins and minerals an what not..  Your body acts like a giant filter for the baby.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	Infants under a year cannot handle the trace botulism often found in honey.  Older kids and adults can with no issues.  When you're pregnant, even if you DO get sick from botulism, your baby remains fine.|`|525065471178504d5bad6323445442f3aa	A baby's digestive tract hasn't developed enzymes to properly digest certain foods.|`|rog4GDgaaa	The mother has a well developed immune system. You can get away with eating a lot of things baby can't. It isn't much to do with being able to handle the food as the potential bacteria contained in it. Honey can even contain small amounts of botulism bacteria.     Honey is, in a gross but realistic sense, Bee vomit. They ingest nectar from flowers and later regurgitate it for the young larvae to feed on. Course, this is about the time we take it. The nature of it's making means it's open to all sorts of bacteria, fungi, etc.  Your body is more than adequately equipped to deal with that, but a baby's immune system is immature and the bacteria in honey could be dangerous.    Other foods like peanuts is a matter of allergies. It's recommended to give highly allergic foods like peanuts, shell-fish, etc. at least after 1 year, and some say after 2.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Well, honey itself is safe. What's dangerous is that it might contain botulism. Adults have immune systems which can easily fight off a few botulism spores - and in any case they wouldn't go through the placenta - but babies don't.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	certain varieties of honey are contaminated with a bacteria that is harmless to adults but can prove fatal if eaten by an infant. It's only varieties of honey produced by a certain type of bee that are dangerous to babies but it is so hard to guarantee that the honey did not come from that variety of bee that health authorities recommend not giving any honey to your baby
sDAnuaBYaa	whole grains, beans, fruits and vegetables.    cut out cheese, bananas, processed junk, and refined grains. If it keeps up through the diet changes for 2 weeks see a doctor.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	try giving him a sippy cup of white grape or pear juice daily. Make sure it is welch's or another brand that is actually white grape juice, not juicy juice which is white grape flavored apple juice. try to limit the amount of apple and banana products he has as they can be binding. also make sure he drinks plenty during the day...water is the best. My 3 year old loves it icy cold. sometimes he would rather have water than juice or milk!|`|shKc7lZcaa	Can he eat apples with the skin on it yet?  (I can't remember what age my daughter starting eating the skin...)  The skin of the apples has lots of fiber.  Lots of fruit and ruffage (like lettuce) should help also.  What about raisins?  They are a natural laxative and should help.  Try to load him up with lots of foods that have fiber.  Blueberries also have a high fiber content.  I *believe* raspberries do too...I think...    Poor thing!  I hope he gets to feeling better soon; how painful, uh!|`|1NLNZbzXaa	My niece was having the same problem and we gave her prunes. My parents suggested it. You know what? It worked! Almost too well.
eXsR8Gx5aa	I wonder if it is the cold?    Elijah and I both have nasty colds, he is feeding more than usual too - I wonder if because he won't take any other drinks he sort of snacks if he has a tickly throat?    My boobs are the same size - not getting any smaller so I don't know about that.     He is sleeping more - I think alsi because he is poorly, he normally has half an hour in the morning and 1-2 hours in the afternoon, he's had half and hour this morning, 2 hours at lunch and another half hour just now.    A six month growth spurt mightn't feel as bad as the others since like Elijah, Alfie is on solids which can help.    Maybe (and I have wondered this) the fact that you have a cold can affect your supply temporarily? It would stand to reason really.    I know what you mean about a minute to yourself, when he is awake he won't let me leave the room - even to blow my nose or pee without him screaming!!    get well soon  x|`|hTQg5tgPaa	I have the same thing with mine quite often and she's over 9 months.  If he's active and gaining weight and has clear urine, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  I wish sometimes that God made us with a "gas gage" so you know how much they're getting. I especially notice this when she's in a growth spurt.  Your body will adjust, they say that the baby is the best pump.|`|jgDlkSiWaa	Accorging to kellymom.com  "Common times for growth spurts are during the first few days at home and around 7-10 days, 2-3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months and 9 months (more or less). Babies don't read calendars, however, so your baby may do things differently."    So, keep nursing. It's probably a growth spurt. Try to get some rest. Lay with him in bed and play. Snuggle up. You both will fall asleep. Good luck!|`|e49178f67a815a64799d8c1237b9affaaa	My boobs also went down in size but I think it was them adjusting to demand - ie they weren't the huge size just after giving birth.  I still found even though they seemed a lot smaller they still produced what was needed.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	It could be both.  You need to find a way to get a break-even if it's just an hour.  You need rest in order to properly care for your baby.  Also, drink lots of water and keep nursing.  He's going through a growth spurt and he's sick so he needs lots of fluids to keep from being dehydrated.  And you need fluids to keep from being dehydrated and to maintain your supply.
f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	It all depends on your child. There's no real answer because all children are different. My daughter didnt go through a growth spurt where she was eating every few hours until she was about 12 weeks, but my son was almost instant, he had his first growth spurt at like 3 weeks lol. So my point is, no children are the same so she could go through it in another few weeks, she might not. Just focus on her health and you should be fine! :)|`|69DjSUVAaa	I found it used to be approx every three weeks he had a growth spurt and would feed constantly.   Unsure what is going on with him at the moment though as he just wants to feed all the time.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	6 weeks, three months and now 5.5 months. These are the ones I noticed more. It seemed like they grew over night. They grow so fast don't they.   I notice also her cheeks get really chubby  right around a growth spurt.|`|Kg5KX432aa	they go through loads of growth spurts the first year, and mainly the first 6 months. She'll probably have another around 3 months and 4 months and 6 months|`|oXzHvsBpaa	My son also had one around 5 weeks and he just finished going though one. In the span on a week he went from 5 ounces of formula to 6.5. He went though it when he was about 2.5 months old. Around maybe 11 weeks or so it started.    I would say that she has one coming soon. I was told that they constantly have them the first year.

Melrose is rather hookerish....so stick with the 1st one.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I think Jocelyn Nicolette is very pretty.

I love that name for a baby girl! I'd definitely keep it because it goes and sounds very well together. Jocelyn Nicolette.  Good luck! |`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I love Jocelyn, such a pretty name for a little girl.  I like Melrose as a middle name much better than Nicolette.  I'm not fond of Nicolette at all.

qUH9q4Kcaa	I think it's a great idea. Children can learn a second language easier when they are younger, opposed to when they are older.     However, I believe the first priority should be English. If the child is showing proper devolopment in learning English, then there is no harm in adding on a second (or even third) language.     On the other hand, if learning extra languages hinders her ability to properly learn English, then teaching those extra languages should be minimized and slowed down.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I have mixed feelings about this. Because my stepdaughters mother speaks Spanish while my husband and his family speak English. My stepdaughter has THE biggest problem speaking in general. With either language. Its like she cant find her native tongue so to speak.     I think its amazing when kids speak multiple languages. I actually think its a huge advantage. And its unfortunate its not offered at a young age. (In most areas) And I dont know if my stepdaughter has an issue regardless of the language or if the confusion came about from not knowing which language to speak. At home theyd speak Spanish, in school they speak English and she STRUGGLES. With both languages, so it always made me wonder. And of course, I have nothing to compare it to so I really just dont know.    But I remember growing up and watching Sesame Street. Before I went into high school, Sesame Street was about the extent of my Spanish. I could count to 10, but that was about it. Until high school at least.    ** ADD **    That's actually probably the EXACT reason with my stepdaughter's problem. No "native tongue" was ever determined for her. So she was always confused....makes sense to me! I agree with you....they need to speak their one language first before taking on another. Or you have a very confused child...    ** ADD **    Its actually very similar. We didnt know about my stepdaughter until she was 2 yrs old. So her mother made the choice to mix the languages since birth. And since then, shes struggled. So was it because no native tongue was determined? It was always a mix. I have absolutely no idea.but its always made me wonder.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I think it's a great idea. My dad's from Chile and speaks Latin Spanish among other languages, I am learning now and would like to start teaching my daughter around age 4. I would like her to have a good grasp of English first. I too, have read many articles saying teach them young, but equally as many saying let them master one language first.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Bad idea.  13.|`|xK6wehG7aa	It's better to teach a child a second language when they are young and already picking up on their native language. It's easier for them to learn and they remember it better.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	I have mixed feelings about this.    I think a child should master English before learning other languages.    But at the same time, I see how easily my son learns at this age. It very may be easier for him to learn 2 separate languages now rather than trying to learn one later if he chooses.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Children will pick up another language more easily if they start learning at birth than they would if they started later. Leaning two languages at once isn't going to slow them down at all. They will learn English at the same rate they would if they were only learning English so I can't think of any reason why not to teach them, even if it is just because. If a person has the time for that, good for them. And what a lucky kid.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	From birth is when they should learn the second language.  I think Spanish would be the best to go with.  My friend has her two year old in sign language.  However, I have no money and I don't know Spanish or sign language, so we're SOL.|`|kQEnJpOvaa	I think it is GREAT. The younger the better, it is much more easier for them to take in all this info at this age than say 20 years old.|`|miPubuDYaa	I think its a great idea. My father is from Cuba and wanted to teach us spanish when we were little and my mother refused. My father isn't bi-lingual but actually can speak 3 languauge fluently and read latin. My mom is Italian-american and only speaks English and pigeon italian. All my life i struggled and stuggled with a second languauge. In grammar school they tried to introduce us to spanish and even with my dad's help i could grab it. And in High school i had to take french & Latin and had a hard with them too    Before my daughter was born i purchased a cd of baby first french,  since i could read it. And durning play time i would play it in the background, it was just music and silly song in french. Nothing like Repete after me "Parle-vous francaise? Or Passe le frommage" It was to indroduce the french sounds and pronouncation. She is 7 now and can still pronounce alot of french words like a pro. rolling her r's and such. She didnt learn any real french but her pronouncation is good so if she chooses french in school maybe it will help her.    I know these tapes helped.. For my second child i'm going to be doing this with both french and spanish.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I think it is great. They are sponges if you have the time DO IT!!! Good for them    i think there is no to young of an age. Like I said sponges|`|ukZd6gWeaa	i think teaching young children more languages is a good idea but not at the same time, i learnt english and welsh , both from birth and used to confuse the two but now i can speak english and welsh fluently because i speak a mixture of both at home and i go to a welsh scool. I am also fluent in spanish and french and i'm learning italian :) i'm 13 btw|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I think teaching a second language should wait until the child has a good grasp on their primary language.|`|Ulff1hcDaa	The younger the better.  The youngest learners are like little sponges.  Later it gets harder.|`|AA11481889	Children are sponges.      Don't let your political views get in the way of taking advantage of a child most able time of learning.    The older the child gets, the more confusing it can be to learn different languages.  I speak from personal experience.  When their young, it's second nature...when they get older...it's actually a conscious learning process.    I believe that everyone that chooses to live in this country should speak english...yes...and it should be the primary language we teach our children....but that hasn't stopped me from allowing my spanish speaking mother and aunt start speaking to my son in Spanish.    And he's picking up both languages quite nicely...and if we had anyone on my husband's side that fluently spoke german...he'd be learning that too.    It's my opinion, that the more tools we can give our children, the better off they will be for it.|`|eCbhygS8aa	GREAT IDEA!     My husband speaks some Spanish, so he's teaching my daughter what he knows; on top of that, we're going order the Muzzy second language program for kids.    They say children are most receptive to second languages before they turn 5, that's why we're starting our kids now.      There's no reason why a child can't learn proper English and a second language at the same time.    ETA - sorry, here's a  working link      http://www.early-advantage.com/Howitwork...|`|diaSqz8laa	kids are able to master up to SIX languages by the time they are 5 years old. The younger the age  the better. They pick up on the second language easier and faster than any person over the age of 5. After 5 years old, the ability gets less and less with each year. If your household is bilingual, (you and your mate speak more than one language) it is ideal to teach the baby to talk both languages. He will pick it up naturally, and he will not confuse the two languages. Their brain is able to absorb so much as toddlers, why not fill it with other languages? It's great for them. Children are able to learn sign language even before they are able to speak any language.|`|AA10730513	As long as the kid doesn't act / feel overwhelmed - I think it's a great idea! I have been told that many people in India are expected to learn 3 languages at an early age. (The language spoken by their area, the one understood by more of India, and sometimes English.) This was told to me by guys who were from India, so I believe them. And while their English wasn't perfect - it was good.     I don't have links to the research, but I do know a guy who thoroughly researches almost everything he tells me. He said that once you hit your teen years, hormonal changes and stuff actually make it HARDER for you to learn new languages. So it's better to learn a few while you are a kid.     I think that if the parents are fluent in multiple languages, learning 2 or 3 from a young age is fine. I have one friend who is excellent with both English and Spanish. His mother knows almost no English. His father knows both but is better with Spanish. The boy can speak both with perfect accents. It's really cool! (actually, he is a man now. but he was good at both when he was a kid too.)    When both parents aren't fluent in both languages ... I think 3 or 4 would be a good time to start introducing a few extra words / phrases. My daughter is very proud of the little bits of Spanish and sign language that she knows. I really should encourage her to learn more. But now that she's in first grade - we are already becoming overwhelmed with homework. Maybe that should be our project for this summer.|`|qa24GAqNaa	Yeah. I know i acouple languages. Since I'm half italian and half jamaican I speak some italian, english, spanish, japanese, french, filipino, and a little sign language. I was taught when I was 3 or 2 (now 15) It may not be fluently but it is good enough!|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I think its good for a child to know more than one language.     I started teaching my daughter sign language at 3months old. She is now 2 years old and loves signing things. She didn't really cry when she was little because she could sign what she wanted. If she was wet she could sign diaper or if she was hungry.    I will start teaching our twins sign language starting in a couple weeks. I think its great if parents want to teach their kids different languages. They learn faster when they are younger than when they are older.     By the time my girls are in school they will know english and sign language plus they learn spanish in school|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I'm planning on teaching Jamie ASL, as my aunt is a translator (no one is deaf, she just decided to learn it and worked with kids who were deaf at school). My older sister was taught it for a while (her dad made my aunt stop because she'd sign instead of speak lol).    Now, Spanish while he's little? No. But once he's about 5 or 6, yes. Its easier to learn young, and by then he should be doing well enough with English. Plus, down here it's really helpful with jobs and such.|`|AA12145826	I began speaking to my daughter in French and English right from the get go. When she was 3, her pediatrician became concerned because her language skills were lacking a little bit and suggested I switch to just exposing her to English for a little while until her speech pattern could catch up to other children her own age. We held off on the French for a year and she was able to catch up to (and in some regard surpass) her peers. We've since gone back to introductory French and some Spanish. She amazes people all the time when she can pick up a book and will point to everything on the page and give the person the English, French & Spanish word for that object.
dLadxEJSaa	Yes, the one with the big boobs I asked about earlier.|`|XCueIYnYaa	Are you serious!!!!!!  it means the baby is sleeping in the same bed with the parents. There are things as co-sleeping beds. Its so the baby can be close to the parents.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	co-sleep means u sleep either w/ ur baby in ur bed, or w/ the baby close to ur bed, in a co-sleeper (bassinet)|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	does dumbass mean you have a "dumb" ***??? man....|`|A7SJT50Kaa	i cosleep with my hubby...we are looking for a third to cosleep with...you interested?|`|e3mf7sw6aa	No. It means your baby/child shares a bed with you. (the parent(s)|`|viwq8ldvaa	It is a term used to explain when a child is sleeping in the same bed as their parent(s).  Btw ... that was far from funny !!|`|8WRnqs08aa	cosleeping is having your baby in bed with you while you both sleep|`|frvbZ6auaa	Co sleeping is with your baby in your bed with you. A lot of moms do this because then they can just roll over and feed the baby without having to get up. But they have linked the increase of cosleeping with the increase in SIDS deaths, so it is not recommended.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	"Cosleeping" is when you have the baby in bed with you. I wouldn't recommend doing it, or if you do, don't do it after the baby hits 2 months. They start getting used to it and will never wanna leave your bed! Say goooooodbye sex life!|`|JP2h62qiaa	You, you babby daddy, yo babby and yo coworker. Gotta mix it up like George Dubbya does ;)|`|3qI1oyFaaa	WOW.     um no. "co-sleep" means you have you baby sleep in either your same bed (a "family bed") or right next to your bed (they make "CO-SLEEPERS" for this), rather than in their own crib.|`|ogdm7RLYaa	I just recently realized the difference....    Co-sleeping is when baby is in the same room as mom and dad, Bed-sharing is when baby is in the same bed as mom and dad.|`|ragX39pfaa	no, with your baby|`|3ebc425dfc34d77aab552c551168acc9aa	ha..that would just be wierd...no, it refers to the baby sleeping with their parents in the same bed....it has it's benefits as far as easy night time feedings, bonding, and creating a sense of security for the child but it can also be difficult to get the child to sleep in their own bed later on (speaking from personal experience here:))|`|FEzmVmFjaa	lol.. It means sleeping with your baby, rather than him/her sleeping in their crib, and cosleepers are little basinet type of beds for the baby that kinda attatch to the parents bed.
mx3gFmIKaa	My son's school district, Brandywine School district in DE, this year is 12,915.00 per pupil, we choice him into this school district.    Our feeder pattern is Red Clay School district and it is 10,000.00/yr    Next year I choiced him back to Brandywine but incase we don't get it I also choiced him to Christina school district, school profiles say 10,890.00/per kid per year      In our state, Brandywine school district has the most money per pupil.  Other higher ones were Lake Forest 11,299.00, and Laurel 11,118.00, the lowest was Smyrna 9,346.00    the cost is listed on the school profiles site|`|AA10186411	Please put him back in private school so he can spell better than you.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Nothing...the taxpayers pick up the tab.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	That number is too high at ten grand per year    you can get the stats from either Google  or by writing your state senator or representative|`|9b6a51f72b4ce44cd195fb24fccdaf8caa	Probably alot but it costs the parents too. Food,clothes, field trips, pictures,parties,science projects,sometimes even concerts, etc....and lets not even mention senior fees...(if you're poor) it almost makes you not want to graduate because you gotta pay! ~_~!  It's insane.|`|d933e4b97b43aa7bfb10ac2da32dceb4aa	The cost to put a child THROUGH a year of public school varies with the county/state or province that you live in. I am curious about the privet school; is your son learning to be a hedge?|`|Gij9LCwoaa	it doesnt cost anything in the us. if that's where you are|`|alAtUXvyaa	public school is free    there are school taxes that you have to pay, but everyone has to pay those, regardless of whether or not they even have a kid|`|6nUprmu5aa	Not sure about that, but my children have never set foot in a public school and never will. Any old thug child could be going there, how do you know that their parents CARE about the child's education and don't just send them because it's the law? I teach my kids that learning is a privilege, and I wouldn't want them around thugs that don't want to learn. I'm not judging anyone who sends their child to a public school, just explaining why I'm against it. I home school my oldest 4 and my 2 other sons go to private school. I think the money is worth it.
vpHhryPWaa	Out of the jar, I think it's ok for about an hour or so.  I think the jar, once opened, is good for about 3days if refregerated.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	after being opened, if you put it in the fridge, only 2 days.  and if left out at room temp, then i'm guessing no more than 4 hrs.  edit---just the plate with no lid? probably 2 hrs.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	1 hour. Do not use it after this unless your putting back in that fridge, then it is ok for 24 hours if you have it in a sealed jar/container|`|wtvzW516aa	I would say no more than one hour especially if you have heated it up. If you are referring to the remaining food in the jar, it can be kept in the fridge for up to 48 hours! But, I tend to only keep it for 24 hours at the most. Jarred baby food is cheap so I don't have an issue throwing it away.|`|cMpYz5B4aa	actually if you refrigerate the baby food in the jar, it can last 3 days. [it says so on the jar]
qJaKF24naa	headaches are normal sign... Speak with your doc about it.. Maybe you have high blood pressure that causes headaches too... I get really bad ones every now and then.. Have suffered through them all except one migraine my head hurt so bad I was in tears at work and couldnt do anything... But it is safe to take tylenol during pregnancy but since your early i would confirm just how much your allowed by the doc.   Try laying down with a cool clothe on head to help it go away a bit and take it easy if your stressing they will come more!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	they suck don't they? Its because the surging hormones.   I'm 8 weeks & I still get them constantly, some days I wake up with them & just stay in bed all day...   |`|wbZp6ZcPaa	it's the hormones-sorry. It sucks!!! My sister had a migraine for her first trimester that she couldn't take anything for. And I had a headache on and off my entire pregnancy. Just try to get as much rest as you can and drink lots of water. It won't take it away but it could help. Good luck!|`|JFjc5g8eaa	i have them 2 and im 8 weeks with triplets also dizzy r u idk we should ask a doc and take Tylenol|`|cypZ0ykXaa	hello! congratulation first! even i have severe head ache dear. i'm 23 weeks preggy.i take a cup of hot green tea & feels  a lot better.ask yur gyn to help u out.take care"good luck"|`|XyRzSzjtaa	dont know about jazz ??????????????.    THANKS NICE BUT YOUR BEING REPORTED FOR ABUSE ANYWAYS SOOOOOOOO JAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ OFFFFFFFFF|`|rnTNu6MTaa	It sucks but u get them in ur first trimester or 3rd trimester. I had them and they made me throw up really bad. :( And the bad part there is nothing u can do to pass this stage. Just to adjust and be strong because it will go away.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	It's the sudden change in hormones.|`|IINSHqz2aa	Your body is adjusting to your new visitor.  Talk to your doctor asap and see what is recommended before you start taking any medication for it.  In the meantime, cold compresses will shrink the blood vessels to ease the pain.    Hope I helped.|`|0722e5ddd4c6c3cb4e310338f3c85935aa	I am 17 weeks and 5 days and I still get them! You can take Tylenol, and try a warm compress over your eyes, that always helps me! Good luck and Congratulations!|`|t5KoPRVbaa	I got really bad migraines with my 3rd preganacy, my hormones were really going out of control, my lil guy is 5 months and I still get migraines on a weelky basis. alot of water a cold mt. dew( for the caffeine) and a dark room usually help.
XOtOMncwaa	Isn't the whole night of sleep great! She might not do it every night from now on, but now that's she's done it once she will probably start doing it more often. My son 1 and he sleeps all night, but there is the occasional night that he might get up once and fuss for a minute. But once he slept through the night once, he started sleeping through the night more often. I would let her sleep as much as she needs to during the day, depriving her of sleep will only make her overtired, then she will probably get up even more often at night, and be more fussy. Just let her sleep when she wants to sleep, but sleeping through the night at 6 weeks is great! My son didn't sleep through the night until he was 10 months old... and before then he was getting up on average 4 times a night! Good luck to you!|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	Be sure to let your baby sleep during they day...they need it.  Otherwise you end up with an overtired, miserable baby who is going to have trouble falling asleep, which means an overtired, miserable mom who is going to have trouble falling asleep.  At this age, sleeping through the night could have just beena fluke...many babies will do it here and there for awhile.  Mine did it 2 times before he was 2.5 months old, but by 3 months he was sleeping 10-12 hours at night, which was HEAVEN!!!!  I held my breathe every night hoping it would last!  For your sake, I hope this is the start of her sleeping through the night, but don't get your hopes up based on one night.|`|lGSUToFQaa	she is no doubt hitting a growth spurt and will start sleeping through the night don't worry about her sleeping during the day, it's okay she will still be tired tonight, they always are, my son started at 6 weeks going to bed at 9p getting up at 5a, which is when we have to get up so that worked great, congratulations on the beautiful daughter|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Sleep begets sleep, don't keep her up unless you want her awake far more then you desired at night.    If you are lucky she might sleep through the night from now on, but that's pretty rare.  Most babies don't do it until they are much older - some not until they are 2 years old.  Even adults don't sleep through the night, most of us wake up at least once - we just have the skills to allow ourselves to fall back asleep too.    Enjoy this now, she's likely not to pull it again anytime soon, but if she does enjoy it.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	It will though which is the stinky part. My son sometimes sleeps though the night in his swing and sometimes he doesn't. Last night he didn't we had to sleep on the recliner together. We tired to keep him up more during the day so that way he would sleep at night and it worked for a few days but then he was back to being awake at night. You can try but chances are they are just going to go back to their regular schedule.|`|oPRmgyXzaa	it was just a spurt, but soon she will get a regular sleeping habit of her own. at 6 wks there is not a safe way to keep your baby awake during the day.(they will eat, sleep and poop for the first couple of months) your sleep habit while you were carrying her has alot to do with that also. just nap when she naps. good luck|`|qStmw7qgaa	My daughter started at 5 weeks sleeping 7 to 8 hours, and then jumped to 10 to 11 hours.  IT ROCKS!  You may find that she just stays awake more during the day.  We started putting out daughter down at 8, but then she would get up at like 3 or 4 at first, and then think it was play time.  But now, she goes down at 9, gets up at 7 and then sometimes goes right back to sleep for about an our or 2.  It is amazing.  We just keep her awake during the day by playing with her a lot.  It works great.  :-)  But I would say just keep up what you are doing and enjoy this to the fullest.|`|TxDrVt3haa	That's wonderful!    I know some babies who did start at this age, and some (like mine!) who would sleep for 5 hours max (that's considered through the night, BTW!!!)   Lots of theories abound ,but the fact of it is, until they are about 6 months old, you cannot manage or train a baby at all. Napping is very important.  Nice thing is, though, that once an infant is asleep, it takes a lot to wake them!      Just let her decide her sleep schedule.  Then around 7 months, you can pull back on responding to her through the night, let her learn to soothe herself.    It is a great idea to establish a (flexible-it changes with her development ) schedule though, because they will learn certain "cues" that tell them it's sleep time, and if you never stray from it, they will never expect anything different.      My kids are ruined because we took a more relaxed approach, and now bedtime takes for EVER because they don't know if they will be able to sneak in a few more minutes of hanging out before the lights go out!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	That's great! Congrats on your first whole night's sleep! The good news is now that she's done it she will do it more and more but the bad news is it probably won't be all the time from now on. She will still go through stages and some nights she will want to eat more or wake more and just need comfort. But it will get better and better, remember that when she goes through a week of waking a lot, the next week will probably be different. But the way to get her to sleep is not keeping her awake during the day! If you don't let her nap enough she will become exhausted and actually have a harder time sleeping at night!!! Try a warm bath before bed to relax her but don't deprive her of sleep she needs during the day.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	my 8 wk old did 7 hours at 5 weeks and 6 hours at 6 weeks and its not happened again since. she usually only sleeps 2 hours during day but still only goes 5 hours max before needs feeding again at night. in fact she seems to go longer when she has slept more during day. mine went through total growth spurt at 6 wks and nursed constantly..was exhausting, i think im due another one too...
e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	I found out at 17 weeks, so you should be able to find out at 20 weeks pretty easily.  I drank cold orange juice before my test to make sure he would move during the ultrasound.      Good luck!|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I found out that I was having a girl at 21 weeks. Another sonographer confirmed it 2 weeks after that then again 2 weeks after that. And sure enough we have a beautiful baby girl. Good luck!!! Enjoy the sonogram-its a magnificent and awe inspiring thing!|`|7C9Ett7Caa	As long as your baby cooperates, meaning showing in-between his/her legs, u will definately be able to tell by 20 weeks. I found out what I was having at like 16 or 17 weeks. Good luck and congrats!! Also, what do u want?? Boy or girl??|`|FP8Avd3oaa	Really high, most say that 18 weeks is when that starts to develope so I think you should be good.    If you drink sodas, have a caffine free soda 30 and hour before you head to the doctor that way the baby will be moving a lot.|`|Kg5KX432aa	almost 100% you'll find out today. They make you wait until 20 weeks because that's when the baby is big enough to know with a good accuracy the gender.   Good luck! That's the best doctors appointment ever :)|`|XyRzSzjtaa	20 weeks|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi,dear..    well there are very good chances that you will come to know that what sex your baby is...i think its the very right time to go for a scan & get it tested as at this time mostly the doctor's just don't make a guess but are really very sure about what they are saying..    hope you return happy home..  keep us posted what the results were...are they pink or blue..??    hope i have helped..!!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I found out with my first at 21 weeks and found out my second at 19 weeks.  Very good chance you will find out if your baby keeps its legs open|`|XmJvXSqvaa	they say your actually able to at 16 weeks. but doctors wait till 20 weeksish because they want to be sure they can tell. so i'm sure you'll know (: my doctor waited till i was 20weeks 3 days and we could definately tell there was a little boy in there (:|`|OuaZBkU9aa	My first was never in the position where they could see so it was a surprise when she was born.  But with my second they could see at 18 weeks.  So as long as the baby isn't in an a position where they can't see then they will be able to tell you.  And if it is getting up and moving around sometimes helps to move the babies position.|`|t5KoPRVbaa	Your chances are really good, if the baby lets you. The doctor will tell you it's not 100% sure though but they know what to look for and are good at it. Good luck!|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	I am a sonographer. At 20 wks, I'd say I can tell the gender with about 98% of my babies (but we have much better machines than most of the doc offices around). Please remember that it is not all up to the person doing your ultrasound to figure out the gender. The baby has to open its legs or else we don't have a chance. I usually explain it like this... If you would walk into a room and see a naked baby sitting on the floor facing away from you, you wouldn't know the gender, right? The same is with ultrasound.      Chances are baby will cooperate, and you'll find out.        ps, I would like to set the record straight for some of the replies that I see here... Your doctor Does Not do an ultrasound to determine the gender. He does an ultrasound to look for abnormalities. He could care less what the baby is. That is just a perk for you.|`|fZgqzPSNaa	Yes, i was worried about this to, but do remember the appt. will last about 20 minutes to a half hour cuz they do a lot of measurements of the baby in all different areas and positions and your baby will move when the nurse is pressing on your belly to get the best measurements it can and sometimes they have to get the baby to move to get accurate measurements. Its so much fun, I would also find out before you go if the will record a video of the ultrasound for you if you pay a small fee or bring your own bland dvd, i was able to do this and love showing it off!! Good luck!|`|1bnhwGACaa	thats the better time to find out b/c if it is a boy you will see and if it is a girl it is more defined  ill be 19 weeks when i have mine hope they will be able to see it|`|M1MZy2GEaa	Very, very good depending on the position of the baby. Usually you can get a pretty accurate result 18+ weeks into the pregnancy. I hope you get to find out today, congratulations!!|`|AA11223133	You've a good chance as long as the baby doesnt cross its legs. Good luck x|`|a3cb80b66a772a6b621fcf095945a298aa	pretty good if the baby Works with you...i found out what i was haven when i was 21 weeks with both my pregnancies...both girl...when the tech went over my first daughter parts i knew it was a girl before she said yep its a girl but with my second i had to have the tech point it out....good luck!|`|qJaKF24naa	Great chance... but girls tends to have their legs close. I went last night to a 3d place to find out mine.. I am 18 weeks and found out I am having a girl! At first her legs were crossed but with a little poking there she opened up to show us! :) Good luck its really amazing to see the baby!|`|ZS7MM6Xvaa	My understanding is that they might be able to tell as early on as 16 weeks.  Most doctors won't do an ultrasound that early though because the purpose of it isn't to find out the gender of the baby - it's to check for other organs and development, which is harder to see until closer to 20 weeks.  They look at the kidneys, heart, etc., and if they can see between the legs, they'll tell you the gender if you want to know.  You should have no problem telling at your appointment!  I'm 19 weeks and just found out the other day I have a girl.  Sometimes a girl ends up being a boy, just that particular body part wasn't seen, but if there's a straight shot between the legs, and there's nothing there, then it really is a girl!  Just hope your little one is active enough to move around for the tech.
ZbnxGIsnaa	YES!!!  Take a test.   Definitely sounds like the light bleeding/spotting is down to a possible pregnancy!!!  =)    I had a very light 4 day period with my son and well, he's here!  So, you may be!!  Awww.|`|jZPv153Jaa	well i really think you should take a test!!!! ASAP! the same happened to my sister but she thought it was just her period since it lasted so long but it was on and off spotting with light flows in between than the next month no period shows up so she waits till next period is due and goes to the doctor and hears the news that shes 2months pregnant!!!   . . . .. . . go get tested ok!
47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	if the kid truely enjoys it, why not?     if its the parent trying to live vicariously though the child, THATS when it gets messed up.      the only thing i wish in both cases is that they focused more on NATURAL beauty.  a 4 year old does not need a spray tan and enough hairspray to drug a horse|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I think they're awful.  Oh....lets judge little kids on how pretty they are!  Yeah, those kids won't have self-esteem issues at allll.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	My sister was a pageant child. Not pushed into them but truly enjoyed them. It depends on what pageants a child is entering and what the focus of the child and parents are. There are many small pageants that do NOT objectize small children. We simply see far too many that do.|`|Kg5KX432aa	I think they're very wrong on many levels.  What message are you sending your daughter? That she has to wear makeup and fake tan and wear fake teeth? That she's only as important as how beautiful she looks?   The only thing a child that age should be worrying about is playing with dolls, and making friends, and doing well in school. Putting such a big emphasis on beauty at such a young age is so damaging to a child's psyche. She'll only ever see herself as a piece of meat to be judged instead of as an intelligent human being|`|nMR5TfGAaa	As long as there isn't a swimsuit section.  Something about those little ones parading around in bikinis and winking at judges, its just well, wrong.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Never for my kids. I plan to teach them values. You know, like that looks aren't everything? And you shouldn't judge someone because of the way they look? I plan to teach my children to be kind individuals, not put them in a "sport" that reminds them to be vain and constantly obsessed with the way they look.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I wouldn't personally do the beauty pageant thing with my daughter. Even when she wanted to, I just felt that it gives her the wrong ideas about what is important. I had a friend whos daughter wanted to just do it for fun, but it gets really competitive sometimes and it really didn't do her a lot of good. Now she worries more about what she looks like than school and other things. But that's just my thought on it.|`|AA12145826	Personally, I think its like anything else, whether it be sports, dancing, singing, playing an instrument, etc. as long as the child enjoys doing it and is having fun, then its okay. Once it becomes a chore and the fun goes away, its time to find something else.    That being said, I have a hard time not criticizing "child beauty pageants" that include a bathing suit portion. Honestly, what's the point? At that point its glorified child soft porn if you ask me.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Pageants are a circus where you put your child on stage, and dress them in stupid dresses, and make up that makes them look like barbie dolls.  The you promote to them, that beauty is what matters, and as long as you smile, and come up with a dumb, sweet answer to a questions then your set for life.    I did child pageants and modeling as a young child|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	You did ask.    I think they are horrific.  Little girls already are messed up enough in the self esteem department---but to introduce them to the world of "pleasing" as a life style from childhood? Awful.    When the whole Jon Bonet thing happened 16 years back, the underbelly of pageant life was briefly revealed...and i found it sickening.     The whole "glamour and glitz" nonsense is embarrassing, and to teach little girls to be pseudo adults is insane.    You did ask.|`|YjDLOFzQaa	Their a waste of time, Little kids aren't supposed to be pushed into all that pressure and stuff|`|0QYIbn1saa	Personally, they make me sick.|`|lo4mp9zTaa	i think that parents need to instill in their children that there's so much more than just what's on the outside. Also i hate to see young girls (4,5,6 and so on) being told by their mommies to do these pageants and putting on pounds of makeup, fake eyelashes, 2 piece bathing suits and parading them around and having them shake their butts. it's horrible. Teaching your children to be self confident is one thing (that's very important) but it's also scary with so many child preditors and such. i wouldn't put my child in pageants. but that's just me.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	I really have mixed feelings about it. The really little girls wearing globs of makeup and getting tans and so on is a little crazy. I like the natural ones for really little girls and when the girls are old enough to decide if they like it or not probably around age 4 and then IF they want to do the more glam ones with makeup and so on I think its fine as long as they parents do not push it. Something about babies and toddlers wearing makeup though makes me think its not right.|`|f0LNuomeaa	My daughter does pageants and she loves them.She was the one who asked me to be in them.They make her happy,so I dont see anything wrong with them.The day that she tells me that she wants to quit that'll be the end of it.Last year she cut herself and was depressed and pageants have raised her self-esteem so much.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I think if the child is old enough to ask and truly wants to do them, it's one thing.  If they are a baby or the parents are pushing them and the child doesn't want to, it's all for the parents.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I think they are awful.  Those pageants do not judge the beauty of that child....they judge the beauty of the dress that child is wearing, and the beauty of some makeup artists work because those little girls are wearing layers and layers of heavy stage makeup.  Some of them even have fake dental work to put it, to cover it up when they have lost their baby teeth.  How ridiculous!  Losing baby teeth is a part of growing up, and a part of that child's history, so therefore THAT is what is beautiful.  Those kids are learning early that beauty is what's important.  Well, I sure hope that someone is also teaching them that an education is important.  Beauty doesn't last forever, but an education damn sure does.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well, it depends. if the child is not being forced and it's just used as something fun for the child then i don't see it as a problem. however when i see shows like 'toddlers in tiara's' on TLC then i think it's going overboard. the way they make up their kids and make them do 'tricks' that even the parents can't do.|`|wENdWT5kaa	"I think there is nothing wrong with doing them as long as the mom/dad is pushing them."    Oh, as long as they are pushing them????      Beauty pageants are wrong for young children. Sorry. Dressing them up and putting make up on, they look fake, they look like porcelain dolls.     If it is a beauty pageant, then why all the make-up? Why can't these pageants be based on NATURAL beauty? Why do you have to make a child look fake??     Sorry, but there are too many perverts and criminals out there.  I don't agree putting young little girls and boys out there for them to see. Look at what happened with Jon Bennet Ramsey???
EAzyjftKaa	Relax a friend of mine had a m/c and the next month she was pregnant again she had twin healthy girls without complications.|`|5X6C4s7zaa	I am so sorry for your loss, I had a M/C 10-23-08 and just found out I am pregnant this month so I know how scary it is.  Just take it easy and try to think positive, that's what I am doing.  My aunt had a stillbirth at 22 weeks in May of 07 and went on to have a healthy baby girl delivered May of 08.  My prayers will be with you and your little one:)|`|MQ83HGD5aa	One of my friends had a miscarriage last year and shortly after got pregnant. She just had her baby a few days ago. Just relax and try to take it day by day.|`|DI8o8r1Caa	I am so sorry about your miscarriage.  I know it's so much easier said then done, but try to relax and stay (I know, I hate when people tell me that when I worry about my pregnancy.  How do you not worry?).  I wish you all the luck in the world.
aaj0M0Vnaa	it sounds like maybe you have a cold,it seems a lot of people do at the minute with the crappy weather. But its normal to feel ill when pregnant, especially in the first stage, most women get morning sickness which is usually in the morning (hence the name) but with both of my pregnancies i had little bouts of sickness throughout the whole day. I would'nt worry you'll feel better soon and it wont affect the baby either incase your worried.|`|h5LOGiCmaa	Totally normal!    I'm 10 weeks pregnant, and I still feel like crap!    Hang in there girl!      And Congrats!    Just make sure you take care of yourself, drink plenty of fluids and rest!    Take care!|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Well it is winter time, so that's all normal. Has nothing to do with the pregnancy though..or at least I wouldn't think. Go to the doctor and get something prescribed you can take while your pregnant. Even if you do get something over the counter speak with your doctor and/or the pharmacist before you make any descions. Medication can be very dangerous while you are pregnant so be educated on what you are buying. Hope you feel better soon!|`|uO47mDSSaa	im 22 weeks in the last 2 weeks i've been falling apart. Dry mouth/throat, ear congestion, stuffy nose and some blood clots, dry eyes, burning in chest when i breathe in and no appetite at all. Dr said it's the cold weather. I don't even want to leave the house. I feel even worse when im at work i feel like im gonna pass out.     Anyways right after i found out i was preg. Had a sinus infection, headcold and the stomach flu. Along with being so tired and morning sickness.. It was not fun|`|NuNJONpyaa	Your hormones are going nuts gearing up for that baby to grow exponentially in a very small amount of time!  Hormones affect every function of our bodies, and if they're out of whack, other things will be too.  Your defenses may be a little down because you're body's busy with other things.      Don't worry unless you start feeling like it's the flu and not just a cold.  In that case, go to the doctor (which would be a good thing regardless).|`|YtSGbYqEaa	your gonna be fine im 16 weeks pregnant and im going through the same thing it sucks i know but you will be ok just go to the doctor soon to get your vitamins you will need them
OCdsZC5daa	taking and having her tested is the dumbest thing anyone could ever do!.. some of the smartest people in the world did bad in school. contrary to what the schools want you to think learning is like a finger print no two people learn the same way.   you don't need to ask yourself why your child is failing school, but why is school failing your child?   if you have her tested they are just gonna pump her up with a bunch of mind numbing drugs so all she can do is sit at school in a haze and become dependent on it and any brilliance in her head will numbed along with the rest of what makes her an individual. my best friend was given drugs for ADHD and if he dosent take them he will shake really bad and get tummy aches. the best thing for her would to be home schooled and if your not able to do that get a tutor. chances are she just needs to learn one on one and that's why she dose well at home. some of the most important smartest people in the world did bad in school. they thought thomas edison was retarded!!!..  what im trying to say is she is most likely very brilliant and i don't want that to numbed by a ADHD drug. why dont you do some reserch on  "gifted learners" and encurage her to be who she is. you never know who she may turn out to be.|`|1gyzz3kxaa	If you suspect your daughter has ADHD, schedule an appointment to speak with her teacher about your concerns and ask that the Teacher/Parent Comprehensive Rating Scale be conducted.  Its a simple questionaire that both you and her teachers will answer.  The results of the test are not concrete but used as a guideline as to how to better address your daughters' behaviors.|`|f1AvsgCDaa	probably talk to a pediatrictan|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Other then poor grades, what other behaviors does she exhibit that would make your suspicious of ADHD? ADHD is a life sentence, and I would be very careful to evaluate many possibilites before accepting that, and especially not the medication. How old is she? What are her sleep habits? Eating habits? What is her IQ? What does she do well in school?
0VHolTVEaa	You should count yourself lucky your not feeling sick. Most women have sickness but not all so enjoy and dont worry
f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	I just have to disagree with one thing that you are doing. You are breast feeding and also formula feeding your baby. I just think that's wrong. You should be breastfeeding ONLY or formula feeding ONLY. I know some doctors say its good but think about it. The breast milk is the most purest form of milk and the best form of milk for the baby and you are counteracting that with formula milk which if you read up on it, is not very good for babies, but the doctor's wont tell you that. But that's your choice and that wasnt your question so I will move on.    I think you should give him the breast milk in the morning like you are doing but instead of a bottle at 9:30 you should give him some baby food. Cereal might be too much for him right now unless you are going to give him rice cereal, which is lighter. You should give him some fruits in the morning (9:30), then when you give him breast milk at 12 he'll be good. At 3:30 instead of giving him formula you should try some more fruits or this time a vegetable if he would like it and try the rice cereal - and you should pump milk at night so that at 3:30 if he doesnt want to eat cereal or fruits or vegetables atleast he can still have a bottle of breast milk. I strongly suggest that you should NOT be giving the baby formula. Please please reconsider and pump your breast milk during the evenings or if you can do so at work that way he can have bottles of breast milk. You can always freeze them.    EDIT: I know you talked it over with your doctor and I wasnt saying that you were being a bad mom or anything, this is just my personal feelings on what I have read about formula. There's always something going wrong with formula and I guess because I am a naturalist I dont believe in giving my children artifical things. Formula doesnt = death in children all the time but there have been plenty of cases where things have gone wrong with formula and I just dont agree with what they put in it. Please dont take what I said as an attack on you it was more like I wanted to help you. Here's some articles:    http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/3...  http://www.raisingbakersfield.com/home/V...  http://www.nrdc.org/breastmilk/formula.a...  http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articl...  http://www.breastfeeding.com/reading_roo...    I hope these help. And again please dont take that as me saying that you are doing something wrong, it was my own person feelings and I jsut wanted to give you some advise.|`|FRwxXGynaa	I think the formula you are giving him at 9:30am is probably making him pretty full so he's not too hungry yet around 12:30. Remember that baby food should not replace the formula or breast milk, it is just an extra for discovering texture and taste. Just try and feed him the formula/breast milk when he is ready, he will tell you! My baby is breastfed and doesn't eat much at all in the afternoons!
KmC0K59taa	I had glasses at age 3.  I remember them showing me pictures of bunnies and shapes rather than the letters since I was too young to read.|`|WveXRwt4aa	I have and everytime I see one I think how cute they look. So tiny!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	my husband got glasses just before he turned 3 years old...his eyes are horrible though,  he had jaundice when he was born and the stupid nurses let him get the gogles off his eyes under the jaundice light they use,  they dont know how long it was off but hes pretty much blind in one eye and the other one isnt alot better. (and he had a lazy eye and had a patch for a while) but yeah, sometimes they have to have them young, and its not easy to keep them on them, and they break them alot...it would be a headache.|`|G5vGTTqhaa	They could have downs-syndrome many of babies with that need glasses really early|`|bQk0vpfSaa	ive never seen that before but i have heard of it|`|uZdSCx1paa	Parents should be aware of signals of poor vision. If one eye turns or crosses, that eye may not see as well as the other eye.     If the child is uninterested in faces or age-appropriate toys, or if the eyes rove around or jiggle, poor vision should be suspected. Other signs to watch for are tilting the head and squinting. Babies and toddlers compensate for poor vision rather than complain about it.    Should a baby need glasses, the prescription can be determined fairly accurately by dilating the pupil and analyzing the light reflected through the pupil from the back of the eye.     Babies have poor vision at birth but can see faces at close range, even in the newborn nursery. At about six weeks a baby's eyes should follow objects and by four months should work together.     Over the first year or two, vision develops rapidly. A two-year-old usually sees around 20/30, nearly the same as an adult.    Hope that answers your q!!!|`|IGhUA1Vdaa	My son recently got glasses. I had been noticing that he had a lazy wandering eye since he was one.     Well I didn't realize that he could of needed glasses until I noticed he was so clumsy as far as walking into walls and tripping on things.     He also stood way to close to the TV and when I would set him on the couch he would say he couldn't see.    He can talk by the way. So I took him to the eye doctor and they performed tests using a projector on the wall with pictures not letters. He could see the big pictures. They got smaller and that's when he had a lot of problems telling us what they were.     The doctor than dilated his eyes and had us wait awhile. Than he was brought back in and tested again. Same deal. He told us my son was far sighted. He got his glasses and wow, what a difference.     He isn't as clumsy and can see the TV and tells me he can now see the books I read him better. His school work has also improved too.    On the baby thing, i've only seen babies with glasses that were premies and were known to have issues with their eyes from visiting neurologists and the eye doctor.     Im sure this is a hit and miss thing but as they grow older and can speak im sure their prescriptions become more suited to them.|`|claW4UUcaa	i've seen them. my friends son has glasses. he's almost two though. i always wondered how they figured out what strength lenses they need. i know this isn't an answer but i thought your question was interesting. can't wait to read your answers.|`|4pqu1SWAaa	The doctor will 'refract the eye.' This involves beaming a column of light through lenses onto the retina of the patient. The doctor can actually see the beam of light come to focus, and thereby select a corrective lens.|`|IApsG1f1aa	when making a prescription for a baby or a toddler and optometrist will use a machine that measures the speed of the eyes dilation. This tells them how strong the muscles in the eye are. Glasses for infants and toddlers are not made to help them see better. Instead they relieve eye strain and help the eye grow stronger and develop properly.
rDO6iEh9aa	Believe it or not females body fluids are very hostile to sperm. Although possible, highly improbable that you would become pregnant if you had sex the day before ovulation. You are more likely to get pregnant in the days following ovulation. If the sperm( 1 single sperm ) survives the journey through the uterus, it must stay alive waiting for an egg to fertilize, most sperm will last only about 1 day. Ovulation must occur within this time. It's true that a single sperm could survive 5 days , but not at all likely, very rare in fact. If you're trying to get pregnant I wish you the best of luck !|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	sperm would be good in you're body up to 5 days.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Yes sperm lives in you up to 5 days after sex.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes, sperm can live for up to 5 days inside you.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	yes very good|`|627pWyVkaa	Yes i would say so. Sperm can live upto 5-7 days max some say! I wasnt ovulating the day I had sex! I never tested after that day So i assumed I was safe from getting pregnant (cuz i had messed up my birth control) and wanted to make sure i hadnt ovulated or would. And Im 18 weeks 5 days now! very good chance. Good luck.|`|MCTyWCu2aa	Ya i was watching sex for dummies!  and they said that sperm live for up to 5 days in a womens body. Yes your chances are pretty good.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well they really only stay alive for that long if you have fertile cervical fluids present.|`|fhic53hyaa	well the sperm dies when it hits the surface but if it went in the vagina far enough then it could stay alive that long|`|gBDNbzJ2aa	yeah.. it can live in the human body for 3 days or maybe longer :)     37 weeks with a baby GIRL!
3A73oIoraa	Don't worry about it. His instinct to crawl won't be put off by that. He may remember what happened or not but if he does his hesitation will be very short lived. He will probably be trying to crawl again tomorrow. If you want you can encourage him by putting toys he likes just out of his reach in a place where it is safe for him to crawl.|`|50BdfHuDaa	I don't mean to be mean but common sense is that you should never place a baby under the age of 18 months on the couch.  Period!!  Injury can occur.  My doctor told me that while I was pregnant.  If you didn't know this then you will be seeing lots of the ER in the coming months.    FYI: I hope you know also you should never leave baby in the tub and answer the phone or leave the room for any reason!!  I know I sound harsh but there is nothing as precious as the gift of a child.  treasure him and keep him safe. kids will be kids and get hurt.  It's natural and unavoidable at times but I still would  recommend parenting classes for you.  I took them myself.  There is nothing wrong with getting educated in child safety.  may save a life some day.   Oh, He will forget this happened and start to try again soon.  Don't worry about it.  Give him his space and he will do it on his own.  Don't force him or encourage him as most boys are stubborn.  mine is.  get over it and let him be.  you'll see I'm right soon enough.

4604flr2aa	The CIO method is a very touchy subject amongst mothers because the method itself leaves too many grey areas.  How young?  How long?  Under what circumstances?      In my opinion, CIO has a time and a place and must be approached with caution.  From personal experience I cannot say that I have NEVER once let my baby cry for a few minutes.  Baby's do cry as a means of communication but it's also a normal, natural function and the simple act of crying is not harmful to an infant.  Mothers are hard-wired to react when we hear our infant crying, we wouldn't be human otherwise.  I think each mother needs to decide for herself what she is comfortable with.  I personally wouldn't consider letting any infant under 6 months of age cry for any longer than absolutely necessary (long enough for you to...prepare a bottle, gather supplies, go pee, etc.).  That baby needs to know that they can count on someone to be there when they are in a time of need, it's a critical stage of development.  At the same time, babies are going to cry, no way around it and if you decide that you're going to rush to pick up the baby at every whimper, you're in for many sleepless nights and hectic days.  My general rule has always been what I consider to be common sense:  Always check on a crying baby...always.  Then you spin the wheel:  Are they hungry?  Could it be gas?  Diaper checked?  Hot?  Cold?  Once the babies needs are met, are there still tears?  Does holding baby help?  If it helps, by all means hold the baby.  An infant over 6 months of age that has been tended to and had all obvious needs met would not stand any harm from being let to cry for a few minutes to allow the infant a chance at experimenting with self-soothing techniques (yes, babies do have those built-in if they're given the chance!).  And again, how long to let the baby cry creates another huge grey area because there are so many factors to consider.... A general rule of thumb might be 5 minutes inbetween check-ins to let baby know someone is nearby (rub baby's back, sing a song, etc.).  I personally would never let a baby simply CIO all night long and completely ignore them... no matter their age.  There really is just a lot of common sense involved in making decisions on the CIO method... first and foremost is even the definition of CIO.  Some people think it means "letting a baby cry it out on their own all night long" and others use the term more loosely, like I've described here where you might use it in 5-minute intervals....      They don't come with instruction manuals, do they?!  ;-)  Tricky stuff!    Good luck!|`|SjX72fPyaa	I have never been able to let my daughter cry it out personally.   The first 2 weeks or so after we brought her home,she refused to sleep at night and would just lay there screaming no matter what we did.   Even though her father suggested just leaving her so she could learn that nights are for sleeping I never could. I'd leave her for maybe 5 minutes and then I'd go and get her.  The first few nights I would actually pick her up and hold her until she fell asleep and then I starting leaving her in her crib and just standing next to it holding her hand and talking or singing to her until she fell asleep.   Eventually she figured out that when shes in her crib shes supposed to sleep and now as soon as I put her in there for the night she falls asleep almost instantly.|`|uhBkbgoaaa	IF YOU THINK BABY IS SPOILED AND CRIES SO BAD THAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT HURT IT PLEASE LET THE BABY CRY , ALWAYS CHECK THOUGH,IF HUNGRY, NEEDS A DIAPER CHANGE OR HOT TEMPERATURE  BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE THEN LET THE MOTHER BURN (MAKE SURE THERES NO COVERS IN THE CRIB)|`|cWP73qEsaa	i hate that thought! i think people who suggest it dont have children. i have 3 kids and i never ever let them cry it out. people say oh if u run and get the baby he will become spoiled and its not true. studies have shown that a baby who is tended to actually grows up to be a happy baby and loves his parents more because he feels loved and cared for. can u imagine the baby having a serious colic and just leaving the poor thing wiggling and screaming? i picked my kids up (all suffered from reflux and colics) and i would massage their bellies. it sometimes gets irritating to hear crying so much so if i have to sway rock sing ill do it.   i think 3 to 4 minutes is too much but my kids never cry softly they wail lol and get red so i run to them lol.|`|b6fIIIhZaa	Do it. I started lettin my son cry it out when he was around 5 months old i would give him 15 mins on the clock and if he hadnt stopped he was prolly upset cause he was hungry and i would feed him then he would usually fall asleep. No harm by 8 months you should be letting you child cry it out everytime you put him down so he gets ise to it and within a week or so he will know when its bed time and as long as he is fed and on a normal bedtime schedule he will go to sleep my son usually crys it out 2 times a week and he is 12 months old now.  Good luck parent!|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I think it is lazy on the parents part.    i hate the cry it out method!!    The child can ONLY communicate via crying, so to deny them is displaying to them that you do not want to communicate with them.  it just gets them more and more upset, and finally they stop from exhaustion.    Please do not use this method.    For the above poster - the child has been bent to your will, it stopped crying because they conceded defeat.  my son knows his bedtime, because he has a ROUTINE and i adopted that when he was a week old, and now has been sleeping through the night since he was 6 weeks old and is now 7 months.  maybe you should get up and tend to the child as opposed to sitting there listening to them cry and think "they'll be right".|`|TH2KdpKAaa	babies usually only cry if there is something wrong (wet nappy, upset tummy, wind). Don't let them 'cry it out'. They have no other way of communicating apart from crying, so to leave them crying and not try to find out why they are crying is a bit mean in my opinion.|`|bKWjkOoLaa	I think elliesmomee is completely correct if I could give her a thumbs up I could, but I can't so I am writing this. My son who is almost 9 months has a nightly routine and the same bed time but sometimes when I put him in bed he cries for 2-5 min. I believe that letting an older baby cry no more than 10 minutes. I didn't let him cry for anything until he was about 5-6 months old, am I a bad mother, no, I get a lot of people tell me he is a very happy baby. It is all what is best for baby. so give me a thumbs down if you don't like what I have to say, I don't care. I am a great mom and I love my baby more than anything else in the world.|`|uLGqDh47aa	Part of this depends on the age of the baby. an older infant may cry at times just to be held. Some think they need to be held constantly. If you are sure that nothing else is wrong with the baby(and its an older baby), then i say yes, it is ok...to an extent, to let them cry a little. You can continue to talk to the baby or something to let him know you're still there, but if you run to the child every single time he makes a tiny wimper, he's going to know thats how to get what he wants.|`|waU776uwaa	Whether its good or not I couldn't do it. It breaks my heart to hear my son cry! Imagine me pretending that he isn't so that he calms himself down? I couldn't do it.|`|SEwGPHiLaa	I have been told that is is good to let them cry it out, however as a mother to a newborn I find this very hard to do.

The baby is obviously crying for a reason...if you put it to bed and they're not tired of course they're going to cry no different then a child who has a set bedtime but wants to stay up, I know my parents always bent the rules (possibly because they always watched Americas Funniest home videos at my bedtime.) So they changed my bedtime from 7:00pm-8pm so I could watch it. When I try and put Amber to sleep and she starts to cry and doesn't want to sleep I pick her up and play with her some more till she's good and tired then try again    I personally think schedules are pointless within the first year, only because they don't understand what you want them to do, I just go with the flow and Amber has a  2 hour window of when she goes to bed so I know basically when she's going to sleep.Makes each day different from the other lol     I have friends that do the CIO method they live by it and it works for them, but it def doesn't work for me, but hey it's their child they can do what they want and I will never judge them on it

I had (what seemed like) a full fledged period when it was due, but at the time I was actually 4 weeks pregnant (2 weeks from conception).  The "period" was light, and spotty and brown.  Sounds like you should take a test!    Good luck!|`|e9m6Y4bfaa	You should go to the doctor to get that checked out. That happened to me and when I went to the doctor I found out I was having an ectopic pregnancy (I wasn't in any kind of pain either).    It could be other things as well. Are you using any kind of birth control (the pills, depo shot..)?
ibWLdXlJaa	http://www.visionworkseyewear.com/kids-e...  These would be your best bet but are pricey. They have metal memory components so are flexible and will go back to their shape. Harder to break.     http://www.allaboutvision.com/buysmart/k...  This one is tips for when you are buying glasses. Hope they help!|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	None of my kids wear glasses, but I own a daycare, and one of my daycare kids does. She has a pair of metal frames with springs that curve around the ears to be more flexible (and grow with her), and the hinges at the lenses bend both ways. The shape of the lenses is not the most attractive, but she's two, so it doesn't really matter. Glasses are just super expensive in general. A friend bought her daughter (4yrs) a pair of "barbie" brand frames, and spend over 200 on JUST the frames. The mom of the daycare kid found them at walmart. She said the whole pair, lenses and frames, was 40 dollars. It was a find because apparently the size at the bridge of the nose is really hard to find. So, maybe try Walmart for your little guy. I shouldn't know this much about glasses. How random is that!?! We just had this conversation the other day.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	That sucks... I remember my older sister getting them at 3 and I know my parents went through a LOT of them, so the stories go....They had to tape them and fix them alot themselves to save money. They bought one of those around the head straps, like goggles. SO that she wouldnt mess with them much but she was 3 so she found ways to break and lose them for a long time. I think she was like 5 or 6 before she stopped breaking them all the time. I would call the docs and find some really safe and good suggestions.
aJjV5b95aa	I think to an extent every parent feels this way, but it is even worse for teen parents. I had my son at 14 and I an still being told what to do and what not to do (I am 21 and he is 7). I just let them say what they feel they need to say and if I think it is something I want to do or try I do and if not I just say thank you for the info and move on. At first I argued with people but that did nothing but make me more made because they said I shouldn't have a kid at my age anyway. Don't let what they say get to you they can say what they want but it is up to you to decide whether it is info you will use or not.|`|myEwHgI1aa	Wow, sounds like you need to just let it roll off you. Every parent, no matter how old, goes through that stage. Oh, and what people have told you is true, sounds like they are trying to be helpful. Don't get so offended! Just let it roll off you. People won't change, and they will keep telling you what they think is best, just stop letting it get under your skin. Like I said, most people are trying to be helpful.|`|JdgEp2X1aa	I am 20 also and I had my son at 19!     It seems like my aunt is always suggesting all types of stuff when it comes on how to raise my son. I be so over her when she be coming to me with that. I love her to death but she be getting on my nerves, not even my own mom be doing that!. My aunt only has 1 child and she thinks she knows it all...lol but my mom has 5 children and doesn't act like she is an expert and tells me what to do. Well I guess my aunt is doing it just to help, but I want to tell her to back up off me...lls|`|mRnTvuOPaa	Not a teen mom  - not a mom at all. But I do realize how that sucks for you. I get crap from people whenever I take my 2 nieces out - and I'm 23! You need to realize most people don't do it to be messed up. Most of them are trying to help. Some because they think you are still a baby and shouldn't be having babies. I know that's not true for all teen moms. But, like some other stereotypes it's true enough for the majority so everyone assumes it applies to you too. Others do it just because it's your first kid. It's not easy to raise children - and people that know this from experience will tell you things to be helpful. Unfortunately they don't realize how bad it comes out. You're going to get mad and frustrated, but just try to stay calm when people get involved and politely tell them thank you but you know how to care for your child, or something along those lines. That usually shuts them up!|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Im not a teenage mother but I wanted to share with you that it doesnt matter your age. People will tell you how to parent your child. Its just the way society is.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	It's not just teen moms that get all the advice from everyone.  I'm 39 and still get people telling how to do it.  Get used to it!  Just listen and take the advice then YOU decide what is best.  We can never learn too much can we??   I think you just feel like they are telling you al this even more so , but because you're a "teen mom", but it's a fact that everybody gets unwanted advice at any age.  I was a 1st time mom at 30.  I had my 3rd at 34.  People still do this to me and I'm sure I'm not the only one out there who gets unwanted advice.  You will get it from the baby's Dr, as well.  Just tell them what they want to hear and listen to what they have to say and then YOU make the choice.  Just know that they are only trying to help because they want to help.  Just wait for your chance when you can be the one to give the advice or help somebody out.  You don't think that when my 18 year old niece starts to have kids of her own I wont be there telling her what to do and what works and what doesn't work!  Sometimes you'll get the best advice and love it, while sometimes you'll think this person is psycho!|`|ajDohnPIaa	Trust me i know how you feel...  Hunny, I go all day listening to it. They think they can tell me when and not to wash my baby or what to feed her, or what clothes she needs to wear...    Just ask them if you can have your space.. And that you are the parent...they aren't the parent..|`|ibWLdXlJaa	That happens to everyone not just teenage mothers. It's just people trying to be helpful mostly so just take it in one ear and let it flow right out the other.|`|rcdTluUjaa	It's not just because you are a teen, I had my daughter at 16 and heard stuff like that all the time, I like you thought it was because I was young. I had my son when I was 23 and and another daughter at 25 and I still hear stuff like that all the time. It doesn't matter how old you are, people will still let you know when they think you are doing it wrong.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I wasn't a teenage mom, I had my first at 23, then had two others. It was still the same. My husband's family drove me nuts saying things like you were talking about. I have friends that still give me advice about what to do with them as teenagers, and it's usually the ones that don't have any kids! It makes me crazy...|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Yes.I am 18.And I feel I know my kids even though they are adopted more then anyone else.|`|SB0aKhFbaa	true. your probly a milf bunny
ZbnxGIsnaa	I'm sure that if it is the same thing you had with your daughter everything will work out perfectly fine like before.  I am still so happy for you that you are pregnant once again.  You deserve every bit of it!  =)      Pregnancy Complications    Complications: Subchorionic Bleeding  Sometimes, blood clots form within the layers of the placenta. But more often than not, they heal themselves.  What it is: Also called subchorionic hematoma, subchorionic bleeding is the accumulation of blood within the folds of the chorion (the outer fetal membrane, next to the placenta) or within the layers of the placenta itself. These bleeds, or clots, can cause the placenta to separate from the uterine wall if they get too large, if they develop in a bad spot, or if they arent eventually reabsorbed.     How common is it? A good 20 percent of pregnant women will experience some kind of bleeding early in pregnancy, though its often hard to tell whats causing the problem. Subchorionic hematomas are even harder to pick up because they dont always result in noticeable spotting or bleeding, especially when theyre small.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	consult a docter not us. WHAT EVER YOU SADO|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I wouldn't worry about it because every pregnancy is unique.|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	Did they call is a subchorionic hemorrhage?  These can be small or large. Small bleeds are common complications during pregnancy. Typically they do not reoccur. Only one time have I seen someone have a bleed in the same place on different pregnancies.   So no, I don't think it will come back.|`|e5O7hQb8aa	umm...idk but my mom has blood clots in her leg from giving birth to one of my brothers, and then when she was pregnant with me she had to take heparin shots. but the blood clots are stationary now. i wouldn't worry about it but u might have to take heparin shots for your next pregnancy if u r going to have one.|`|MfCkiJCVaa	My cousin had this with her first child but not with her second.

VKgD1K3baa	I introduced it at 4 months with just a few sips of water.  mine doesn't take a bottle either. I started with a tiny bit of water in hopes that I could sneak some pumped milk in there and he'd take it. He is now 5 months and starting to get the hang of it. I got him a nuby sippy that is 3months+, it's never too early to try!|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	My son has never taken a bottle.  I started giving him water in a sippy cup when he started solids at 6 months.|`|pXSKSS3daa	We started practicing around 7 months. He's now 10 months old and totally weaned from bottles and using all sippy cups for his feedings.|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	My son started sippy cup when he was 6 months old|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	at 6 month we started with the soft top sippy cups, my daughter rarely had bottles. on the other hand, my 15 month old niece is still on bottles and wont drink from anything else. so i guess a ll babies are different|`|68c6B8dRaa	"dont know if it makes a difference but my baby has never had a bottle."    It sort of does; you can skip sippy cups entirely if you like. Sippy cups = bottles, basically.    We introduced an open cup around 6mo; it was used competently by 9mo. There's spilling, so just use small amounts of water.    Later on for around-the-house drinks I used a cup with a top and a straw; maybe around 1yr, or a little earlier, at some point when I had a take-away cup and found out by accident that baby knew what to do with a straw.    Way, way more nicer for all concerned having a baby/toddler who can drink out of something you can get at any corner store or restaurant rather than getting stuck dragging a silly-looking plastic thing everywhere you go...|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	3 months. My son is breastfed and would scream if a bottle got anywhere near his face. I had Nana and Memre try every bottle possible with no luck. So we skipped bottles and went straight to sippy cups at 3 months.|`|nrQijvMuaa	1 yr old|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	My daughter started using the sippy cup at 11 months old with just juice and water. I tried a few times with milk, but she knew the difference. When she was 14 months old, I gave her a sippy cup with milk in it one morning and she's been with the cup since. Good luck!|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Doctor suggested it to us at six months. Took him three months to get used to it though.|`|mOJhj3ssaa	right before he turned 1year|`|3paE1E9Xaa	My son has been on the sippy cup since he was 6 months the dentist told me its actually better then a bottle for his teeth.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	4 months because my daughter wouldn't take a bottle.  She couldn't use it by herself (without me holding it for her) until about 6 months though.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	4.5 months. Then he drank from a cup at 6 months. Plus he was using a water bottle (still does) from the age of 6 months.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My daughter was 6 months|`|mAsQbiIgaa	7 months to drink water at meal times.  I had to help her for first while to tip it far enough back.  By 8 months she was completely independent.|`|1S7uXsInaa	My daughter started with the juice/water combo in a sippy cup about 9 months.  They make special ones that do not leak. . .they may even be labeled as baby's 1st sippy cup.  My son is a little slower. . .he does not even really hold his own bottle, and he is 10 months.  You can start when you notice them taking interest in you drinking and they have control over some of their hand movements.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	my daughter started at 6 months.... i am i understanding you correctly.... your baby has never had a bottle... so its always had a sippy cup?|`|diEZW57caa	We started at about 6 months or so, but it took her a while to get the hang of it.  Now she's a year old and uses a cup like a pro, she can use a sippy cup, a cup with a straw and a regular cup if she's sitting down (if she's not sitting she thinks she can just hang the cup by her side and walk around, lol)
lzcglDnMaa	My sister did this when she was little. One thumb was in her mouth and the other in her hair. She was almost bald on the one side. Get a blankie or a doll to play with that has long hair. It helped my sister. Eventually she will grow out of this stage, but in the mean time get her to play with something else instead of her hair.|`|SbfbYiGQaa	Dont let this turn into a habit. Take her to your GP for more advice otherwise it could lead to something similar of an OCD and affect her future . Good Luck|`|XtO5Nyhtaa	Oh wow-- I feel bad for you and your daughter. How long is her hair? Could you possibly braid it? That might be more comfortable than a pony tail.|`|9xiWHYpHaa	Try putting a hat over her head. If it is long you might want to cut it...

cvcbJlEcaa	yeah they like to eat my four year old is like that if she could she would eat ya outta house and home i think if she is wanting to eat let her eat just like snacks a little before meals and try to make them small things like fruit or veggies stuff thats not to bad for her to eat
XOtOMncwaa	I've been co-sleeping with my son pretty much since day 1, my fiancee works away from home so it's just us in the bed... Last night I get head butted in the nose.... the night before I woke up with a foot in my mouth (well almost) and apparently my son thinks MY face is HIS pillow! I even woke up the other day at the foot of the bed, and my son was all sprawled out using my pillow, and completely hogging the whole bed. It seems like ever since he turned one he's all over the place, and he can't get comfortable unless he's hurting me in some way! But I just can't seem to give up co-sleeping yet... did I mention he has to hold my hand to go to sleep? SO CUTE... but for my own safety I fear he will have to go to his own bed pretty soon!|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	OMG - Volks just reminded me of getting peed on nearly every night when we were just getting started with cloth diapers! Ew.     Luckily, Daddy takes the brunt of the co-sleeping abuse here. He swears she doesn't want him there. (And he may be right - many mornings the first thing she says when she wakes up is "no bed, daddy, no!") He hasn't gotten kicked between the legs, yet, though, so I'll have to tell him how lucky he is!    First thing we're buying when I get pregnant again is a king sized bed!|`|OHq5gSjJaa	LOL...  I sooo thought this question was going to be telling stories of babies suffocating, etc...      But I think you are right.  The real danger is to the parents.  My husband and I often joke about our daughter joining the ultimate fighting tour.  Her signature move is definitely the head-butt.  It hurts the worst when she gets me in the mouth and my tooth goes into my lip.  But she has yet to draw blood.  The key word is yet, I am sure.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	lol My son isn't allowed to come into our bed anymore. Every time he was brought in he decided to get up on his knee's and then headbutt me. I swear a couple times I thought he broke my nose.    Nope...not allowed in the bed, he tosses too much and I can't sleep.|`|BnYrOfYraa	I would like to add myself as a statistic to the "silent epidemic".  I have been kicked in the jaw, chest, arm etc too many times to count by my 22 month old.  My 'favorite' is the boy's super fast flip over in the middle of the night, then BAM, hand slaps down on my face.  Let me tell you, nothing else on earth wakes you up like that!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Lol. My husband has suffered many pulled chest hairs. I myself have escaped unscathed but I'm sure my day is coming.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	They had something on the evening (world) news a few nights ago about this.  I didn't pay much attention though.  I think it was mostly related to younger babies and suffocation.    I think it totally depends on the baby, the parents, both of their sleeping habits, the bed, etc.  There are so many factors and one solution doesn't fit all.      I co-slept w/ Aidan for a little while.  He sleeps like a rock- like me.  There is NO way I could co-sleep w/ Connor.  I would wake up black and blue (that is, if I was even able to get any sleep).|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I've had a bloody nose, a throat jab and a kick in the mouth (he flipped around and his feet were in my face).      I never knew co-sleeping would be so detrimental to MY health.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	No kidding! My son sleeps with us once in a while. Thank god it's not every night - I'd never get any sleep. He's above my head, then elbow in my back, then kick my face, then...    Yep, def dangerous!|`|AA10811784	I was never able to co-sleep with my daughter, unless it was short naps or something. She has always been a tosser. She is all over the place when she sleeps and she'd actually rather have her own space.  Sometimes though, she does come in bed with us in the early morning, like 5:00. She did just this morning and ended up with her head by our feet and her feet by our heads. Of course, she kept moving around. One of these days she's going to kick one of us in the face!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I don't co sleep but my son beats me up all the time...he is always swinging and hitting me in the face, pinching my ear or grabbing my nose.  Then there is the fistful if hair that he grabs and pulls ...I think he is jealous that he has no hair and wants mommy to be like him.    If I did co-sleep I would probably be black and blue all over, with bald patches and lopsided ears.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I get head-butted almost every night and we both have very hard heads. I think the cat takes the brunt of the co-sleeping dangers though. She's a 12 week old kitten and gets smacked, rolled on, and beaten when she curls up with DS. As for me the most serious side effect is loss of bed space. My son is a bed hog like his daddy. I think I get one square foot to sleep in all night.    *edit* I guess people don't get the joke  that this question is about the dangers to the mum, not the baby.|`|lGSUToFQaa	8 yrs ago they said it was a no no now they say it's okay, i do with my son when i can't get him to go to sleep i'm a light sleeper so i wake up when he moves, i hold him, literally he sleeps on my right arm with my left arm holding his waist, he likes to sleep on his side and he always tries to get under my big pillow, so i leaned it against the head board,     a girl in my town fell asleep breast feeding her baby and rolled over on her and suffocated her,  another one recently fell asleep with her baby on the couch and he fell off and hit the corner of the coffee table, he's alive but in the hospital, as long as you wake up when he moves and he can't roll out of bed or under your spouse or you, you should be fine, i worry cause my hubby is a sound sleeper but i always tell him when the baby is with us, i wake him up and tell him and he doesn't seem to move as much, good luck      http://www.phdinparenting.com/2009/01/09...  http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/sleep/c...  http://www.betterforbabies.com/co-sleepi...  http://www.slate.com/id/2020  http://www.easybabylife.com/co-sleeping....  http://www.askdrsears.com/splash-newslet...  http://www.ehow.com/how_2318263_cosleep-...  http://babyfit.sparkpeople.com/articles....  http://www.picknicksbrain.com/tag/co-sle...       http://www.helium.com/items/349175-compa...|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	Olivia likes to kick me in the bladder and poke me in the eye when I'm trying to sleep|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i've been punched a couple times but i guess that would means i'd have to kick my fiance out of bed too     oh yeah i occasionally wak up soaking wet because i've been peed on. sometimes i think i might blow up because my son farts so loud lol|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Exactly! thats why we stopped -no joke! I was getting kicked, pinch, head butted, drooloed on, kicked off the bed and there was literally no more room for me! We even have a king sized bed.     Its terrible not many people actually read your question.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	I have co-slept with all 3 of my kids to some extent. Currently I usually end up with at least my 3 year old in my bed in the morning...he gets up to pee and crawls in my bed when he is done. Most mornings my 8 year old is in my bed too...she claims that she is "sleepwalking" but I am not sure I buy it.    The worst things that have ever happened in 13 years of co-sleeping are children falling out of bed, my 13 year old got "lost" in the bed at under a year old, and I end up with no space or a body part in my face. Every one of the children has rolled out of the bed and landed on the floor. Most of the time there is a pile of clothes on the floor, so I am more scared than they are and no one is hurt. My 13 year old slipped down in the bed in the middle of the night...I woke up and could not find him. I freaked out and ran all over the house looking for him. Finally I got the idea to pull the blanket off the bed and discovered him curled up in the general area of where my hip was! I have awakened to finding all sorts of body parts in my face. Yesterday morning it was 3 year old stinky feet! I have had my pillow stolen, had a diapered tushy in my face...    I know there are cases where children have died in bed with thier parents. I think that as long as the parents are not drunk, on drugs or morbidly obese, it is OK to sleep with your children. I am doubly bad because my bed is a waterbed...and my kids are still alive. you have to do what feels right for your family.    ETA: yeah...I am just waiting for major injuries from a toddler. so far my pride is the only thing majorly injured. I do end up with random body parts in my face. I end up on the couch because hubby and the kids are sprawled out on the bed ( queeen sized). I still have not figured out why hubby feels the need to WAKE ME UP at 2 am to tell me that a 30 pound toddler is crowding him...all I am going to do is slide him over.|`|zwctZ812aa	Lol you don't often think of the dangers of co-sleeping to the parent, but as the answers show, those who have done it know! My son is still too little to really hurt me, but he does like to flail his arms around and I get punched in the face quite often lol. I would have to agree with Jillian about the pee thing though.  My main complaint is waking up wet and trying to figure out whether I got peed on or puked on in the dark bedroom lol.|`|x7vTKP24aa	i just posted a q about co sleeping, i think its ok as long as your aware of what is going on. use some common sence dont put the baby in bed with you if you been drinking /drugging, are a heavy sleeper or like some one else said are really over weight.  my dd is 4 mo and im starting to put her in her own bed cuz she is going longer without nursing, im hoping within the next 2 months shell be able to sleep through by herself in her own bed.|`|Kg5KX432aa	I don't have a first hand account. But one of my first cousins was co-sleeping with her baby, and she rolled over on her in the night. Luckily the baby started thrashing around violently and woke her up. But she could have done serious damage if for some reason she didnt wake up|`|7Tcfc3Plaa	i'm not to sure its even safe to start co-sleeping in the frist place.....i get yelled at by my boyfriend every time i co-sleep with our 2week old....but get so nerves there going to stop brething or wake up and want you right there....maybe try bing lil more corful|`|5DJcir9saa	I personally don't think that sleeping with your baby is beneficial to the child or the parents, but I know there are a lot of people who disagree with me.  Everyone is entitled to their own choices =)      **Why is that if you don't agree with co-sleeping you get lots of thumbs down BUT the people who had negative stories about co-sleeping didn't give thumbs down to those who agree with?Everyone is entitled to their own opinion!|`|6631c5068e2c4c313b1caa78900e6761aa	its not safe, but its so hard to put your little munchkin in another room when he has been sleeping with you for so long... try alternating nights when he sleeps with you, then alone.. also you can let him fall asleep with you, then move him once he's asleep..good luck|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	On our local news this morning, they are investigating the death of a one month old. The mother rolled over on the baby and suffocated it. They are determining whether to file abuse and neglect charges.     *I think the charges are stupid...that mom has to live with the fact that she killed her baby.    I co-sleep with my daughter once in a while, but it is more of a catnap.|`|955YoHvVaa	I've been cosleeping with my daughter for 13 months too and it's getting uncomfortable as shes a bed hog and kicks me until I move over..I am going to try to get  her to sleep in her crib since I woke up this morning and couldn't find her-she somehow fell out of bed and was asleep on the floor!    I just wanted to add i've woken up with a black eye, fat lip, and numerous bruises from the way she sleeps at night.|`|IXqCB5oqaa	I have co-slept with all 6 of my babies, including my twins and have never had any issues. I have heard horror stories but have never had any myself. I co-sleep up until 6-9 months then move them to a crib it's easier for nursing during the night.|`|nbSp469Waa	I know I'm going to get knocked for my answer, but that's okay.    Our 5 year old still sleeps with us, I wouldn't have it any other way, because I know, just like her brother, eventually she will want to be in her own room.  I have had kicks to the ribs, hands in my face, my husband was kicked in the nards by her one night, he has been hit in the nose to where it has bled.  And we have a King size bed, she is just all over the place.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I dunno what the oh jeez is from the first poster.  Are people not allowed to express their opinions.    My aunt co slept with one of her children along the years.  She rolled over in her sleep one night, and suffocated the baby to death.  A horrible thing to wake up in the morning and realise what had happened.    There is first hand experience for you|`|8t8NjjnVaa	It depends on the particular study and who did it!    Of course there is the danger to the parent that no one seems to study!  I've been punched and elbowed in the nose one too many times, woken up in pee because the diaper leaked, and woken up to my daughter sticking her fingers in my nose :)  The snuggle time makes it all worth it though!    My husband has taken quite a bit of abuse too...I almost suggested he wear a "cup", but hey, at least when she kicked him in the nads, he woke up enough to stop snoring, LOL! :)    I've found that it's actually sleeping with the hubby that's really dangerous!  I can't tell you how many times I've woken up freezing because of that cover-hog, or how many times I'm teetering on the edge of the bed because he's crowded me so much.  Plus the lack of sleep due to his snoring has got to be causing me major problems, LOL!    For the baby, personally, I think co-sleeping is perfectly fine as long as you do it safely.  Don't smoke, no heavy blankets, no waterbed where the baby could get trapped between the water mattress and the frame.  Put one side of your bed against a wall or use a safe bedrail (not one he could get trapped in, LOL) to keep him from accidentally rolling off the bed, or just put the mattress directly on the floor.      There also have been some studies that show that it is dangerous to cosleep with a baby if the parents are quite overweight.  Apparently, they can roll onto the baby and not notice.  I personally wouldn't chance it if I was more than a bit overweight.  This didn't apply to me...I'm a stick figure, but it's something to mention in case you are heavier.    Also, I think it's pretty much common sense that if you or your husband are a very heavy sleeper, or are known to kick, punch, or otherwise thrash about in your sleep, it would not be safe to cosleep.    Personally, I coslept with both of my children for part of the night.  I put them down in their cradle at first, but once I went to bed and they woke to nurse, they slept with me after that.    I moved them out into their own beds when they were about two years old, with no stress or tears.  I'm still trying to get my husband to sleep in his own bed ;) Just kidding!
sHk1Tdmqaa	My son learned sitting down and now is standing.   We started at about 1 1/2 years.  They can change their position when they are more confident.  Plus when they go to school or with Daddy, they see other's do it standing, they'll adjust.   Trust me, all boys want to "aim" their hose, they'll stand without hesitation!   I would just encourage the act of peeing and not focus on the position.       On top of that, my son would only poop facing the toilet....awkward.   He finally got the courage to face forward.       Whatever works for you and your son.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	i would teach him sitting at first, then once he gets the hang of it, have daddy show him how to do it properly while standing. Ive also heard to put cheerios in the potty so he can have something to aim for.     Im glad i have a girl. lol|`|230NbPVUaa	We taught sitting down, and he learned really fast, little boys don't have enough control to do it standing up and tend to touch themselves more|`|2d8879147618190440919438922e8a7eaa	I am currently potty training my son and he sits down.  one reason is because sometimes, when a child tries to pee, the push a bit and go number two as well.  now that we understand the concept of the potty, we are working on standing and aiming.    so, i would start with sitting and then once he understands what we use the potty for and has control over his bowels, switch to standing.|`|3CG3rby0aa	Yep i am in the process of doing it right now and he is doing great sitting on the potty.  I will work with him later on the standing up part because i do not want him to be scared of falling in the potty.  good luck and the sooner you get him trained the easier it will be on you.  good luck! :)|`|ekAH05qWaa	i think you start with him sitting down because it would probably be easier for him then maybe in about a year teach him to stand up.|`|o81jR8Wnaa	If he has to learn to pee standing, you should too! Teach yourself to pee standing, then show him how it's done. Here's a quick tutorial for how you do it:    http://www.wikihow.com/Urinate-Standing-...    I'm not quite sure why all women don't pee standing; it's very easy. Your son respects you, and he will try peeing standing if he sees you doing it.    I've visited Japan and Malaysia several times, where most women stand to pee. Public bathrooms are cleaner there, and the lines are shorter. Sitting to pee is a waste of time.|`|wkK5JDz4aa	Standing.    This will Greatly affect his life,    And he will have more pride.
vue9NOhYaa	All women are different. Some women never get a period while nursing, but most do get one eventually... especially if they nurse for a long time. The 'average' is about 9 months for return of menses, but 5 months is normal and common too.    You may be regular from the start, or be erratic for awhile.  Again, either one is normal.  If you've been relying on LAM for birth control, you will need to find a new method now.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	I did not get my period while I was nursing, but everyone is different.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	You can, especially as the baby gets older and nurses less often|`|8t8NjjnVaa	It differs with everyone.  When you get your period back depends on many factors, not just whether or not you are breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding does often delay menstruation after a baby, but it's not the only thing that matters.    Your body, how often you are nursing, if you are supplementing at all, how your baby is sleeping at night, and if you have started solids all matter.    If you are still nursing every 2 hours around the clock, then it's unlikely you'd get your period back already (but again, some do, it depends on the woman).      If your baby is now sleeping longer stretches at night, that can make your period come back.    If you have started solids and are nursing a little less because of that, you may get your period back.    Personally, my first baby had reflux and was pretty much nursing around the clock until she was 8 months old.  At 8 months, her reflux got better, but she still nursed several times in the night.  I wasn't feeding solids regularly (she'd have a bite here and there) until she was nearly a year old, so all of her nutrition was still coming from my breasts.  Because of all of that, I didn't see my period until she was 15 months old.    With my 2nd, she had jaundice and it was really hard to get her to wake up and stay awake to nurse much.  Because of that, I got my period back when she was just 6 weeks old.  But it was light and only lasted a few days.  And about that time, my daughter's jaundice finally improved and she began nursing a lot.  My period disappeared and did not return again until she was about 14 months.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I did get my period when my daughter was around 5 months old too. It was very heavy for the first 2 days I mean very heavy but my period would only last about 4 days as well. Unfortunately for me though my breast milk dried up at 8 months I don't know if one has anything to do with the other just giving you a heads up!|`|IlfEImbRaa	that is a myth. I have twins and breastfeed both of them. I got my period when they were about 3months and it is regular. You might also want to consider a form of birth control soon unless you want to have another one soon.|`|j5UYj1RDaa	mine did come back and wasn't very regular or heavy.  Have you started solids or a bottle?|`|tZt7fUYYaa	i stopped with my lochia at 5 weeks and on week 7 had a two days of light bleeding. then went away, my little girl is 8 wks old and im also bf and sincerely hope it doesnt happen for a good while. but the practice nurse who is also a part time midwife says there are an unlucky few who still have them, so i had implanon put in last week to be on the safe side.
9IFF0vIoaa	Pale is hard to determine.  I am "pale" compared to my mother...she is pale compared to my sister (but my sister is regularly in the sun b/c of horsebackriding).    My babies have always been very VERY light skinned...to the point where they were nearly translucent.  ;)  A doc will know if your child is sick-pale or just fair-pale.|`|HTjtYEFYaa	take her tanning.  If your really worried ask your doctor
260f178c6fc34e7d0c73b917e2a51e55aa	i used to drink something really fizzy, or have sour sweets, and another one that helped me so much was canada dry in the tiny cans (ginger ale). I couldnt live without those!!!    hannah|`|xHKRGEg4aa	hey hun,  I have the same problem, I never actually get sick, but I stay feeling sick to my stomach... What really helps me is to try to snack on some saltines, and if that doesn't bother me, I try to put some peanut butter on them to give me some protein. Also, I eat jello, and that tends to help some.  good luck & congrats |`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Hmmmm, things that worked for me were   Traditional Lemonade - the cloudy stuff  Crisps  Crackers    Getting Mr Berry to cook, while I was in another room as long as he did not cook broccoli - still makes me a bit queasy now lol    good luck|`|8uiH6iRbaa	morning sickness can come at any time of the day especially when you don't eat often enough and your blood sugar is allowed to drop.    i felt sick from the min i got up to when i went to bed i even woke up in the night feeling sick !!!!!    i also went off cooking ( in fact i went off food altogether )    i found that nibbling on ginger biscuits helped me     x  x|`|0VHolTVEaa	Aww poor hun i know how u feel, try eating dry crackers, ginger biscuits, ginger tea (ginger really helps). Dont eat spicy foods or fried foods. Take snacks where u go like crackers so u can nibble on them when u feel sick.   I couldnt cook either and went completely off meat. Try dried stuff and hope it works. Also drink plenty of water. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy|`|98WKYtfwaa	I found that travel sickness bands (seabands) worked for me. I was always feeling sick but never was sick. You can get them from any chemist.    I also found that sucking on a sweet usually fireballs for the cinammon or soft mints for the peppermint. Ginger also helps too but i never tried that as i hate ginger lol.     As for eating, if you feel you're not getting enough goodness then try drinking fruit juices and make sure you're taking a prenatal, it's not uncommon to go off food as you probably already know, just make sure your fluids are up and you'll be fine.|`|m8aqAZgJaa	Get the preggie pops from a maternity store or babies r us. They are kinda sour which helps your stomach. Also make sure that you drink alot of water, gatorade, even pedialyte. Staying super hydrated will really help you feel better. I was extrememly sick for about 4 months and once I had pedialyte I started feeling 100% better.|`|XwjjKkPCaa	I have the exact same sickness as you only i am being sick with it too, its awful i also am not cooking or eating much for that matter, if anyone has any ideas im up to hearing them too, people have told me ginger biscuits ginger ale doesnt work, ive tried everything.     Know how your feeling hun and its terrible just hope it subsides in the next 3 weeks! :)|`|9Ycuoysjaa	1. eat only small portions, bit at a time throughout the day.  2. keep yourself hydrated by drinking lots of water, try staying off sugary drinks.  3. when cooking try not to cook really overpowering smelly foods, as it might be the smell that's getting to you.  4. try relaxing for an hour during the day(a little nap).  Hope these work as they help me.  Just want to say for all those that can't eat, try going to the supermarket and have a look around to see what you feel like eating, that might just make you want to cook it. xx|`|FoDimTxCaa	I find that Himalaya Tea (Yogi teas - www.teaworld.co.uk) works really well for nausea.  Contains ginger and fennel.  Nice gentle flavour and doubles up as a warming drink in this freezing cold weather we're having.  A friend of mine, however, found that just sipping cold water throughout the day helped her?    I'm with you on the cooking thing - the smell of any food cooking really turned my stomach!! Good luck :-)|`|Hu0QKdmDaa	I suggest Ginger Biscuits, dry crackers, dry toast. The main tip is, try not to over do it on butter and cheese? The more dairy you eat while you feel sick, the more likely you are to chuck up.     Just remember, there is nothing wrong with having an off day, nobody expects you to be super-woman. Take a rest and deal with it in your own time. :)|`|aWWgPkryaa	You poor thing...    I found these sweets called 'preggy drops' (why they couldn't have come up with a better name I do not know!)...anyway, they did work very well.  They are a bit expensive so you could save them for when you have really had enough!     My sickness was horrid too and if I feel that sick next time I will be tempted to try and buy them wholesale!!|`|Wu16Ur07aa	I did have problems with sickness for my first four babies, but then with Amberley I was just superhormonal and weird, I think as its my sixth pregnancy I'm fine.  I found dried cranberries and apple puree stopped me feeling too ill.  but choc just made me wanna vom!|`|QCVzUC1baa	I had this problem when I was pregnant and I think its worse to feel sick than actually be sick. I had it when I was 8-11 weeks then it passed.  I munched on Ginger Nut biscuits (even though i didnt want to as I felt so sick) but it did help and I made sure I drunk lots of water and rested when possible. I pulled a few sickies at work those weeks!    Good luck it will get better :-)

Nicole Danielle - I like both names, but, I don't think Nicole Danielle flows that well, maybe the other way around, Danielle Nicole, I think that flows better.      Also using those combos, Cailynn Danielle or Cailynn Nicole sound good, too.    BOY:    Masen James - I like the name Masen James, it's cute, but, I prefer it spelled Mason.  Brayden Scott - Brayden Scott is really cute, I like it a lot.  Although, a y in there always makes it look more feminine to me, I don't know why.

Ahhh but just the last 2 nights she slept for 5 hours straight, she went to bed at 10 and didnt wake up until 3:30!! an then again at 7!  It was great.  Your time will come.. hopefully soon like mine did!    I do that everynight, i will put her to bed an yet stay up for another 2 hours, i go to sleep an 10 min later she wakes up an im kickin myself for not going to bed 2 hours ago!!!

70YyELYxaa	hi there. having a period isn't a "tell all" - as instead of a true period, your body might have been having just a discharge that LOOKED like a period. The pill is also not foolproof... and since you just had a child, biologically, your body is REALLY in "reproductive" mode. All your hormones since giving birth are still really high and/or out of whack. But you can still have all kinds of discharge and it could mean something, or could mean nothing. Everyone's body is a little different. Some people have a period every 3wk, some people every 9wk... and the enormous swings are still normal. It all depends on the individual. Having babies in a row "bam bam bam" - completely NORMAL- as like I said, your body is in reproductive mode. I knew a gal who couldn't get pregnant, went on fertility treatment, had twins. Then no more fertility treatments for the full pregnancy and after giving birth, but 3mos after having the twins, BAM she naturally gets pregnant and has a single child. Her body was in reproductive mode, so to speak, and getting pregnant was that much easier.     Just FYI- I'm not a doctor but was married to a nurse for 10yr AND i was a medical underwriter so I have a lot of medical knowledge about how the body works. Sorry for any typos but I was typing fast!! :)|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	yes, ive heard of many of women that has had periods thru out their pregnancy|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I had a "period" so I thought but it was really odd because it only lasted 2 days and was really light but I didn't think anything of it.  Next month didn't get it and found out I was pregnant.  And oddly enough he always measured big and came 3 weeks early so I think that period I had was just breakthrough bleeding.|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	No, but I had one "period" when I started birth control after my son was born & then didn't have any periods for a couple months after that.    It could just be the birth control side effects making you feel that way.  Even if you didn't react to them before that way if you were on them previously, it could be different this time since your body/hormones have changed.    And my sense of smell is still a bit more heightened (though not as much as when I was pregnant) from before.
vjsT8DMIaa	I just had my baby Nov. 21st, and I had Gestational Diabetes with her. It was my first pregnancy to have complications so it was kinda scary. Well you'll meet with a dietician and they will go over a meal plan with you...tell you how many carbs you can eat...and teach you how to really read labels. Its a rule of 3....3 small meals, 3 snacks, 3 hours apart. And they will tell you whats ideal to eat and what not. You'll take your blood sugar 4 times a day...in the morning before eating, and then 2 hours after each main meal. Breakfast Lunch and Dinner. On top of my diet, I was also insulin dependant. If you're able to control it with diet, thats great, but if you need insulin, don't fret. If you become insulin dependant towards the end of your pregnancy you will go to non stress test appointments 2x week for them to make sure baby is okay. They thought my daughter would be pretty large for my body size, but she was only 6lbs 8oz at birth and was very healthy!! Its hard to stick with any kind of diet when you're pregnant...but its so worth it for baby. Good luck to you!!! They usually like to induce 2 weeks before your due date to make sure the baby doesn't get too large, but I was only induced 5 days before my due date..and that was only because at my 39wk appt...my BP was too high....also, caused by the GD.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	I didn't have it, but my SIL did.  She just had to watch what she ate very carefully.  It poses the risk of your child being diabetic or overweight later on in life.  Some people say if you have gestational diabetes your baby will be big, but my SIL only had a 6lb baby so that's not always true.|`|njLVIp55aa	Yes but dont stress about it...Just be sure to eat healthy and follow everything they tell you and you will be fine...    Good luck and congrats!|`|98WKYtfwaa	They'll forward you onto a dietician who will give you a list of what you can and can't eat along with recipes.    GD is ok as long as you eat the right foods and eat on a regular basis, if you don't it can make your babys birth weight go high, which can lead to being induced a few weeks early and you can also get diabetes later on in life.     My mother had it twice, with me she got induced early and she was fine. With my brother, he was 11lbs 4oz when he was born.
Pf9fyEyQaa	When I went in for my first ultrasound I was about the same and all they could see was a sac as well.  My doctor had me worried about a blighted ovum and everything and it was scary.  I went back in at 8 weeks for another ultrasound and there he was...measuring a little behind at 7 weeks or so.  Now I am 35 weeks and my little boy is healthy!  Even if people tell you not to worry you still will...that's the way we are as moms!      Oh also, did they do a vaginal ultrasound for you?  They did for me but that's still all they could see, they saw absolutely nothing on the abdominal ultrasound!|`|rAkWoweOaa	I went through the same thing. I bled for three months. I went to the hospital the first time I bled and they estimated me to be about 6-8 weeks pregnant, but all they saw was a yolk sac. No fetal pole, no heartbeat, nothing. My hcg's were even really low. They told me to expect a miscarriage, or it was at least a threatened miscarriage. Of course I am telling you this with my 4 month old sitting right here, so obviously everything was fine. I was worried to death, but it turned out okay. I am sure yours will too! Good luck.|`|lGrcLQ49aa	I know it is easier said then done but try to not worry - it is very had to see the baby this early. Your other baby might have just been in the exact right position. Take it easy.  I will say a prayer for you.    Many Blessings.|`|2LAKDPc7aa	Ask Jesus to help you.
vBahPYJGaa	elvis presley lol|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Yes. A year ago from last thursday a girl I knew died from a methadone overdose. It sucks because my ex-boyfriend is the one who sold her the methadone...so I want to be mad at him for doing something so stupid, but on the other hand she did buy it from him and take it.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Kinda... he actually quit doing the drugs almost a year before he died. But they had already created an infection he didn't know about that caused his lungs to fill with blood and he drown on it.     It's sad that he died even after getting clean, and half of his friends still showed up to the hospital stoned out of their minds. It made me very sad for his mother to see that disrespect they had for their dying friend.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Not exactly.    One of my closest friends got drunk and got into a car with a drunk driver.  They crashed into a tree, and she was the only one who died.  I hate drunk drivers.|`|viwq8ldvaa	In high school, my cousin died of a crappy dose of cocaine. He was only 20. And a friend in high school died of alcohol poisoning.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	yes but whats the point of this question and why is it in this part???|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Oh my god! :(    When I was in high school, I remember going into the bathroom and a girl about my age was on the floor and there was vomit everywhere. I pulled her into a position where she could breathe properly and ran for the school aid. She apparently overdosed on medication (not sure which type) because she was dealing with a lot of boyfriend issues.     But that's the most major thing I've heard...and seen. I was completely terrified at the sight and still shiver to it this day!    She survived.|`|RESEYeVlaa	yes.    but she was murdered so i guess its different.|`|H90uflbFaa	my 21 year old cousin died of a prescription drug overdose. now hes dead.|`|8NFLpbJAaa	My aunt tried an overdose, but she didn't suceed. I'm 13 so no i'm not doing drugs or drinking atm.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	none of my close firneds but friends of my friends. he lived off of diet pills, energy drinks & ciggs so you know that unhealthy to begin with. hed drink alcohol about everynight & once or twice a week hed go to a club & take meth. while on meth & drunk he also took DXM he died that night in his sleep. i dont think he as trying to kill himself he was just going in the wrong direction & none of his friends even tried to stop him.|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	My husband had a friend who died of an overdose of Heroin. He was the one who helped him shoot it up... and then his friend died.  My husband has been clean for 10 years.|`|8F3IHGADaa	I had a friend die two summers ago from taking just one pill and drinking a lot of alcohol. It was really sad. I've been off of the pills nearly a year and a half now.|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	my mom's ex co worker was a recovering alcoholic who got alcohol poisoning.  That "one drink will be fine" turned into getting drunk a month down the road when she met a new party bar hoping guy.     Her teenage son went to a baseball match out of state and was told she was not invited to attend with the league if she showed up to the destination take off point with alcohol on her breathe. At 8am, she showed up (and driving) drunk.....    She died that night.    I had many friends and past knowledge of people dying but not resulting in the death due to the drug/alcohol usage.    That was just an influence in their behavior that caused the death. Aka: drinking and drugs caused wrecks, drownings and criminal offenses resulted in death.    I only got drunk one time that I had poisoning that resulted in me drinking due to depression. My bf (ex) at the time didn't take me to the hospital.  You can see why I was depressed and low self esteem for a guy who didn't give a crap about me in all reality. Thank goodness I pulled through, but I know how it is to get so low......I drank to feel good and that is all i remember thinking and saying is I wanted to feel good.....    My husband would never allow me to get like that and cares very much.    I will have a drink that might result in a mild buzz, but I won't get drunk or have too many. I know my limits now and seek professional help if I am that low......    or I will leave my future (pregnant) kids with out a mommy. That is unfair to them and hurtful to my husband/family.|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	I knew five people who have overdosed and died, two of them were some of my best friends. One was one of my best friends who lived in New York so I only got to see him 3 or 4 times a year (I live in L.A,), but we were supper close and we talked almost every day. He was an amazing guy. He had bad heart, there were two holes in his heart, he took way too much ecstasy that wasn't pure, it caused him to over heat and his heart to over work its self until it completely stopped, he was only 19.    Another one of my best friends died of a heroine overdose in a hotel room all alone at the age of 17. I knew about her problem, she told me she was getting help. The day she died she was over at my house in the afternoon, she told me she really wanted to get clean, around 6 she said she had an appointment with an addiction specialist so she left. I got a call at 2 in the morning telling me she had overdosed and died.    If you are asking about overdosing on prescription pills and dying of alcohol related incidents, then I knew six more people who have died from overdoses. A friend of mine went out got drunk, that night in her sleep she threw up and choked on her own vomit. This guy got alcohol poisning, by the time someone called an ambulence it was too late. My aunt and another one of my friends overdosed on sleeping pills and died. One of my ex boyfriends took 3 vicodin at a time and drank some beer, he died. A friend swallowed a whole bottel of advil, went to bed and never woke up.     I still drink and do drugs, I know I should be smart and stop doing it, but I don't want to. I could drop the drugs if I wanted, but drinking holds a special place deep in my heart. I'm care full about it, well as care full as you can be about drugs and drinking.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	two of my ex boyfriends, my best friend and four other people I went to school with and knew pretty well. Well one was from alcohol, but same thing.|`|7yQhPmmlaa	no|`|XLsnuAqmaa	yes,  and its sad.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	my first friend didnt really overdose but he was so fu cked up that he hung himself. i still did drugs after that  and my second friend got so fu cked up he shot himself when i was in the same room.  that made me stop.  now i dont do it as offten but it still slipps.
1s3nddaYaa	i like it. it reminds me of the that singer dude lol. i have only heard the name one time,. so st least youd have a uncommon name|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Yes, I like it. I prefer the spelling amonn, though.|`|nkM6wmv6aa	no, reminds me of those 'f*ck it' and 'f.u.r.b.' songs...not good!|`|U1juqahIaa	I love Eamon. I am actually planning to name my first son that.  It's a great, classic Irish name and I love Irish names.  It's unusual so there likely won't be other little boys with the same name in the kid's class, but at the same time it is not so unusual to the point of being ridiculous and made up.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	No, I think it sounds funny.|`|tWKZVDG2aa	Well in England there is a middle aged TV presenter called Eamon Holmes, so that name just reminds me totally of him and therefore I could never use it for my own child.|`|P9zJmmcMaa	No.  I can't tell how to say it by looking at it, which is annoying for me and even worse for the person who has the name.  It has a biblical flavor to it.|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	No...it's an effeminate name....I wouldn't wish to name a male with such a name.|`|p5eodXcSaa	if u have twins u could name them: Eamon & Demon.  Oooh, scary.|`|9CAXUgOZaa	Yes I do.    I don't know why, but I only started liking it after I was talking on the phone to a guy from my phone company and he told me to call back the next day and ask for him if I still had problems, so I asked him what his name was and he's like "oh, I'm Eamon."  And I was thinking hey...that's a cool name.       lol, what a boring story. Sorry.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	I dont like it.....it gives kids a reason to call demon eamon! Sounds bad!|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	Eamon is different but I've heard it used before.  Not sure I like it though but its up to you|`|AHRLXm1maa	Gorgeous--my co-workers niece has this name. It's a Persian name right? I think its adorable. It's pronounced EE-MON right?|`|GzL8X6vTaa	Not me I don't like it I wouldn't use it.    But that's all up to you.|`|e64yqjCXaa	sorry, but I don't think Eamon is a nice name.    it rhymes with semen.
KHZLPldraa	Baseline Body Temperature.  You chart your temp everyday, helps to find out when youa re ovulating.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It stands for Basal Body Temperature.    Here's a link to a site that lists all the terms you may see.    http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/acronym...|`|GhetCx0iaa	blue ballin' tease   Be Back Tomorrow    lol|`|AA12333757	Basal body temp.
mDsFeDtcaa	Probably about 12 ounces...I usually go by 1 ounce per hour.  I would think he'd take four 3 ounce bottles during that time period.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	he will probably need about 3-5 ounces every 4 ish hours, but i could hardly ever  express that much. best advice is do a little every day and freeze it. my daughter has had a very occassional bottle since week one with expressed milk in, i normally get 2 ounces befor it gets too hard...once i did get 5 ounces but she had slept longer and my boobs were like concrete. i dont think its too early. sometimes needs must, if you can accumulate about 12-16 ounces. they can have pre made formula in the cartons (not powder) mine had this twice when i didnt get enough. h visitor said was best alternative to breast milk rather than powdered formula. but remember everry baby is different and im going on what my baby would have every 4 hours during day, usually 3 or 4 in bottle terms, but is hard as i cant see how much she takes from my breast.  sorry...i sound confusing,.   just incase anyone thinks im advocating pre made formula, im not, breast is best!|`|qh1NHD4Oaa	Ask your pediatrician best.It is a bit early to leave him if your breastfeeding.My son fed about every hour and took about half hour or more to feed.
zK1V9Mu7aa	I had my sweep at 40 weeks plus 4 days, and started loosing my mucus plug in the night along with really irregular contractions. I then had my baby at 41 weeks exactly. The membrane sweep helped kick start things off, but I only really started labouring after the midwife did an internal examination to see how dilated I was. I was only 1cm so they said they would keep me in overnight as my waters had been broken for longer than 24 hours, I ended up having in 2 hours later! I didn't know my waters had broken because I was having a slow leak and confusing it with wee and the wetness of the mucus plug. Put a pad on and if your pad is constantly damp and a straw like colour, but doesn't smell of wee then that is your waters and you should phone your midwife. Hopefully you wont have to be induced though. Good Luck xx
zwctZ812aa	I got one at exactly 40 weeks on a Thursday morning...went into labor Sunday morning at 1 am.  So I don't know if the membrane sweep had anything to do with it or if I was just ready.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I had a membrane sweep at 40 weeks as well.  I lost my mucus plug, had some mild contractions, dilated another cm, and then that was about it.  I ended up being induced at 42 weeks.  So, its didn't work for me, but I have seen many other women say that it worked for them.    I hope it works well for you as well.  Good luck!  :)  Congrats on your baby tomorrow as well!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	mine was almost instant although i didnt realise at the time  loss of yucky stuff followed by a very dull back ache and very light cramps in stomach that slowly got worse  good luck fingers crossed for you x x    P.S the yucky stuff may get blood in it dont panic x|`|dOeE9GCcaa	I had my sweep done on a Thursday and started going into labour on Sunday, losing bits of my plug every day. I lost most of my plug when I was in labour, between contractions. I finally gave birth on a Tuesday. Good luck!|`|y3HLL203aa	You actually may not make it to your induction 2morrow if you're losing your mucous, plug but your scheduled for induction tomorrow anyway.  So sit back, relax and enjoy your last night of sleep.  By the way congratulations!!|`|DDIBEvUTaa	next day : )
627pWyVkaa	She should definetely be talking to her doctor about this, It isnt safe to just stop cold turkey, And yes she may have already caused damage, However its never too late to stop! and thats kind of common sense, even for a non pregnant smoker. :) just encourage her, and reassure her it will help, smoking is associated with low birth weight, which in itself can cause health problems, so If shes only 29 weeks she could definetely stop now and help her babys health!|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Yes if she cuts back now it can help. My husbands co-worker smoked though out her whole pregnancy. He baby was born premature with a few problems at 34 weeks. Smoking can cause the baby to be born early and low birth weight. I would tell her to stop now. Its not too late.|`|mAsQbiIgaa	Stopping any time will be of more benefit to her baby than if she continues.  The babies lungs will be growing most rapidly in the last trimester and that is when babies put on most of their weight so stopping smoking can only aid that!      Also if she stops now it means she won't be smoking round the baby when its born.  In terms of the risk of SIDs, this would be hugely beneficial although you don't want to terrify the poor girl.|`|e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	Well, if she stops now, then she won't be a smoker once the baby's born, which would eliminate the second hand smoke and cut down on the baby's risk of getting asthma.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Cutting back definitely helps and in fact when a person has an addiction the doctor will tell you not to go cold turkey but to taper off because when a person goes cold turkey their body goes through withdrawls and can cause more harm then good.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	SHOULD NOT SMOKE AT ALL WHEN PREGNANT
AHY3UUIiaa	The pill will still be in your system. Some take up to 3months to get out of your system completely. Your next period will be called a 'true period' which will begin to be normal once again cos of not taking the pill. Your body hormones will get use to this and you may fall pregnant after your period. Some take longer then others.    Take Care, I wish you the best of luck.   AJ.X|`|AA11210211	It only took me 3 months after stopping the pill to get pregnant,but I'm not sure on the PCOS:)|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Basically immediately, some women even get pregnant ON the pill.|`|9m2opi6xaa	Okay it is not true that the pill has to have time to get out of your system. I was off the pill for only a week and got pregnant with my son. I had only been married only one month. I missed my doc appointment and everyone said don't worry just go next week it takes time. THEY WERE WRONG ha ha. I had been on the pill about 3 years|`|f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	Pretty soon.      Regardless, make sure you update your partner that you're off birth control and trying to conceive now.  That way you don't 'accidentally' become pregnant by some guy who thinks you're on your birth control and doesn't want a child right away.|`|CUYuAGF5aa	The first day you stop taking the pill is when you can become pregnant and this is why many people who are on the pill and forget to take it just the one day can become pregnant.  Every person is different and it can be an instant thing or take a long time to happen.  Some women on the pill conceive almost instantly they stop taking them where as others can take years before they conceive.  I've had friends in both situations.    Good luck!!!|`|JjBtgSixaa	You should wait about 3 months (using other birth control) and start taking Pre-natal vitamins right now.  That's was what my doctor said.  The vitamins will help your body to balance itself better to prepare for the baby.|`|BP5ykmAmaa	people get pregnant by missing just one tablet so by coming off the pill you have incresed your chances greatly already.,  good luck x|`|39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	It could happen right away. So many people I know got pregnant right off the pill. One friend of mine was on the pill for several years and got off it. She missed her period that month and thought that it was just her body getting back to normal. It turns out she was pregnant. The same thing happened to my sister and someone I went to school with got pregnant 3 times on b/c (even on the shot).|`|7nvqcj5baa	It took me about  months in total to fall pregnant after coming off the pill. x|`|PB2GDzVPaa	The pill is not 100% anyway, so you can still get pregnant whilst you are on the pill however to be safe see your doctor.
yNbGq4viaa	You need to consult your pediatrician about methods to keep her from grinding her teeth.  Your daughter is still cutting teeth however and the others may be bothering her or itching her gums.  Have you tried rubbing her gums with Anbusol or giving her a teether to chew on?  If you have tried these methods and she is still doing it then I would contact the pediatrician for some additional ideas.  My son ground his teeth together for a while, but then stopped when I gave him a frozen teething ring.  He could bite on it and it relieved his need to grind.  The cold also helps the ache.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Its a phase that most or every baby goes through. My daughter did the same thing too. I don't think there is anything you can do. SHe will stop on her own time. Right now, you need patience and tolerance.|`|nYI8eB0Baa	I have the same issue with my 8 month old..I asked her doctor and she said there is nothing you can really do...it is new to them and they are going to try it out and then hopefully gorw out of it.|`|AA10857340	Take her to a dentist that specializes in pediatrics.  They may give you a bite guard for her to wear under your supervision.  Good luck.|`|AA10063059	ignore it,and distract her with something|`|hTQg5tgPaa	I had the exact same thing.  The teeth are new to her and she's just figuring them out.  Eventually mine settled down with it (had 8 at 6.5 months).  Still does once in a while.  But I do agree, it is the most aggravating sound!  But I don't think that there is much to do for it.  She will probably outgrow this stage.|`|ruGhNDmUaa	My daughter ground her teeth for about a month.  It's just a new feeling and sound.  She will stop on her own.  I would distract her sometimes with a toy  or some finger food if she was grinding for more than a couple of minutes.|`|f4yWSulraa	Unfortunately, you should be worried about it.  Although she only has baby teeth now, if it becomes a habit, then they will wear out the permanent teeth just the same.  My son use to do it - it would be a kind of popping sound.  Eventually, it chipped one of his teeth.      The trick is finding the correct response when they are doing it to help them recognize you don't like it.  Little kids pick up and understand a lot more than we give them credit.
j2mRop0laa	I agree with Victory. Just keep doing things your way. Life isn't THAT short (hopefully). However, it will be short if they don't watch the safety of their kids.  Plus, Hello? Does she not realize that she is putting you in a terrible position by insisting not to call. What if something DID happen on your watch and *devastated mommy* decided to take it out on you- in the courts-because she didn't even know where precious Sammy was.|`|AA12145826	Wow, so they want to raise a bunch of hooligans? No let me rephrase that, they are choosing NOT to raise a bunch of hooligans. Personally, I'd report them, but that's just me. What they are "preaching" is chaos and it never works. Pretty soon it'll be "Why should little Johnny have to go to jail for stealing that car and going on a joyride that killed 2 innocent people? He was just living life. Ya know, life's too short to have to do things like follow rules and such..." Ugh!|`|rcdTluUjaa	How sad and ignorant on their part, I bet if something happens to one of their kids they will change their mind, unfortunately that is the price for stupidity. I would just explain to your kids that how dangerous it is, let them know that you love them, therefor you care about knowing where they are and what they are doing. I would also keep play time with those neighbor kids to a minimum, and wouldn't take them anywhere. But if possible keep an eye on them when you can, it sounds like they have no one else to look out for them. Under the age of 7 definitely doesn't make them old enough to look out for themselves. Seriously makes you wonder why they even had kids|`|AA11683646	That free spirit lifestyle looks very appealing until about age 26.    Then the reality of no education, no work ethic, no personal discipline and skills sets in.    Children REQUIRE order and expectations.  Without expectations of behavior and achievement children become directionless.  If other parents choose to allow their children to wander through life that becomes their problem.    Perhaps a short discussion which says something like I'd love to include your child in out activities but he needs to understand that he must abide to the same restrictions which my children do.    BTW- That parental oversight never left here. They were always expected to provide the information, Where are you going, What are you doing and When will you be back? If those plans changed I expected to be informed. If not the privilege was restricted.    Funny, during that time I had a number of parents suggest that we were too hard on them or not understanding of youth.  Now that they are both well along in college getting great grades and working hard, I feel vindicated.  Carry on your way. It will pay off later and YOUR kids will thank you for it when they can see the situation in the rear view mirror.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Tell them that you are covering your own bases, by making sure that the parents of every child with you has given you permission to take the child.  You can do it pleasantly, smiling, with a 'you just can't be too careful these days' kind of attitude.|`|AA11210211	I would still call or go over to the child's house and talk to the parents and let them know the rule you have and ask their permission for their child to go,There really isn't anything you can do about the way they run their house but that doesn't mean you have to change the way you run yours.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	living life should not and is not an excuse to let children run rampant and wreak havoc on neighbors.     if the dog gets out again call the pound to pick him up and honestly they sound like unfit parents. those children are going to grow up irresponsible. Children thrive on routine and need to be taught responsibility and life lessons besides life is short so do what you want.

Ask your Dr. to check your iron levels, as I have a history of anemia when I experience these symptoms.|`|kH56qw2Taa	i have been having this this is the 4th day on a row i get up in the morning then the headache comes and gets worse until i really feel like sleeping i was wondering what it was and hoping itll go away i dont know the answer to ure question but hope u dont feel alone now lol iam 3 n a half months pregnant xx|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	That happen with me, but I had "morning sickness". Understandably that you have a 3 and 1 yr old, but you should really try to find someone to take the kids even for just an hour and lay down. You're draining yourself! Take some advice and find someone to take the kids for an hour or so and just lay down and relax.|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	Hey, I suffered headaches even before I was pregnant. I am sorry that you are in pain. My doctor finally put me on fiorcet.|`|joPJtKemaa	How is your blood pressure? Sometimes from the blood pressure you might get the lightheaded.    My blood pressure is very low and I get lightheaded all the time. Even now.    I eat chocolates or drink a cup of coffee.    Measure your blood pressure|`|EAzyjftKaa	Yes my pregnancy was miserable a horrible headache/migraine all 9 months . I would pass out when i felt this way. But the doctor told me to take a sip of pepsi or coke and that would help it was my blood pressure to low. They gave me Vicodine for migraines at about 7-8 months along. I even had to get a shot once. ask your doctor about advil.
s519vyP5aa	OK let me tell you my story  i took a test on sunday of the superbowl and i got a faint line but it was there but 3 days before i took the test i had a dream the only thing i saw in the dream was the test in front of my face where the 2 lines came up that day i had the dream i had really light cramping and i felt i small tap on my right side the nest day the same thing happened except the tap was on the left side i have 4 yr old twins and a 2 yr old that was had a vanishing twin my period is not due till the 10 of this month and i have taken about 5 hpt and all were positive when i went to the doc the test was PFN so she told me to do a blood test that i will not have results for about 3 - 4 days .. for my test to come out so early i think am having twins Again..       but i hope this helps i did dream it and i did get a positive take a test its worth testing u may be surprised best of luck LOTS OF BABY DUST ur way..|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Sometimes it can be down to you just wanting to be pregnant.  When I was pregnant with my son I never had any dreams and the times I wanted to be pregnant and wasn't that's when I'd have dreams of getting positive tests.  BUT, I have also heard women getting positives after having a dream.  So, it really all depends on how much you are thinking about it.  =)|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	The day I woke up and puked on the floor, I had been dreaming I had 3 babies. I was tired and crabby and yelling at my BF... I woke up and just puked on the floor for no reason. I had my roomate go out to Walgreens and buy me a test. I didnt even get it out of the pee stream and it was DARK positive. I cried and was happy but scared shitless.|`|jZPv153Jaa	well i'v heard that if you have a dream that you're prego than that means someone else is guna get pregnant but im not sure????? have you tried testing yet?|`|lAJwaht8aa	I had a dream about getting a BFP too.  I will be testing next week so I hope both of our dreams come true!!!  Good luck!!
lGrcLQ49aa	You just called a "friend" ugly - You sound really petty - I think he broke up with you because you are childish - but then again you are still a child - so I say - cry a river, build a bridge and GET OVER IT.|`|pXeskVZwaa	Troll
e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	I don't.  I talk to him, but I don't read to him yet.  I think at this point just talking to him and rubbing my belly would have as good an effect.|`|IP2suWFTaa	I didn't read to my son when he was in my belly,but I sang to him,talked to him and played Beethoven music to him.Whats funny is when he was in pre school,his teacher told me she heard a child humming Beethoven in the restroom and she new it was my son.when she walked in the restroom,she saw him humming beethoven and at the same time he was splashing another child in the face to the beat of the song with his wet hands.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	definately! Babies not only have the ability at 28 weeks to open their eyes and hear, but research shows that their brains are at a cognitive level. which means talking to her at this point she may even recognize you from other people.. i don't think it really matters what.. i wouldn't care, as long as my baby was hearing my voice... my wife and i at night, put a flashlight to her stomach to see if she reacts to it. Sometimes she kicks it. it's all responsive!|`|oXzHvsBpaa	We read and sang to my son when he was in the womb. We read him childrens books like Winnie the Pooh, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Sesame street books, ect. We sang Childrens songs to him and just regular music also. He now loves to be sung too.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I never read books to him. They always hear your voice and that is enough really.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	yeah, i do. usually whatever im reading ill just read it outloud. lol, electric bill, recipe, magazine, tv guide, whatever :)|`|lvfXfpdoaa	Well Im only 6wks along with my second kiddo. But in my first pregnancy, I wouldnt read to him, I would talk to him and put headphones on my belly. Such a good memory!!
MeYILJeSaa	I dunno, I wouldn't do it. Although some programs are better than others where it's basically having fun putting on pretty dresses with their friends. I think if I were the mom in this situation I would avoid the pageant and offer to have friends over and have a dress-up and "fashion show" or something where it's not such a competition.  If it is like I described, just a fun little get together where they feel especially pretty for the day, then I think it would be fine. I just get scared when  I hear the word "pageant".  To me, it sounds like this is more toward the milder end of the spectrum.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Depends on the pageant. Many small pageants are not true beauty pageants. They are instead outings for the girls, an interview and a reception. No bathing suits, makeup, or fake tans. I would call the organization and check what kind of pageant this is.
9kPPmazoaa	No it didn't "stain her baby's booty" , lol. Some baby's have this on the when they are born. Sometimes it goes away, and sometimes its there to stay. It typically looks like a black and blue.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Meconium stain for 16 months?  No.  Maybe it's a birthmark.|`|AA11210211	No it's not.|`|pXSKSS3daa	LOL, what?    No, that's silly. Either she doesn't clean her baby's bottom well or it's his skin that is an odd color. If meconium stained a baby's bottom then they'd ALL be walking around with green stained behinds.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	No, that is ridiculous!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	no, if it did every new born on earth would have a green booty  lol.....sounds like she wasnt keeping him clean.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	CLB_tucker-   You cracked me up!!!!  LMFAO        And no, I have never heard of meconium staining a babies butt.|`|955YoHvVaa	I've never heard of that before but my daughter does have an area above her bottom that is discolored and its a mongolian blue spot-it's common in oriental people.|`|JP2h62qiaa	Nope my sons meconium was all over his body and in his lungs. He would have to look like Hulk if that were the case. Lol|`|8026ec062aaa229b35c5aceb76a16035aa	Oh geez, your friend is full of meconium. LOL!|`|lYsrCTCwaa	Kassie is right. Mongolian spots can have a greenish or bluish tint on the skin. They are also common in Native American babies, or biracial babies. In some cases, you have to get them "diagnosed" by a doctor, so you don't get accused of child abuse.
viwq8ldvaa	Take everything, anyone says with a pinch of salt !!  A lesson I learned after many, many incidents involving days of embarrassment, confusion & down right anger !!    You being a nice girl, need to not wear you heart on your sleeve. Keep your guard up & don't let it down. You need to protect yourself and keep strong. It sucks being gullible ... just think things through & contemplate situations that arise in you mind. Weigh out the situation and rethink the days events, and then you can clearly judge if this person means what they say and/or do.|`|Mea7w1Gzaa	always protect your heart even when u think you dont need 2. b.c you will know when you wont have 2.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Just try not to be so open with guys at first.

Second, whenever he makes a promise or a statement, look him in the eye and ask him if he really means it.  If he looks away or is hesistant, you'll be able to tell that he's lying.  You don't even have to compromise the way you dress because you look nice :). You just have to get the message to guys that there's more to you than your boobs.  If they can't see past that, then obviously they're not worth your time.    All the best of luck, and if you want to talk, just email :)|`|RTa3g9ZHaa	Go for the god guys instead of the 'hot', 'cool' and 'amazing' ones because they are the ones who are only out for one thing. Try meeting quieter, not so hot, nice guys who know how to treat people because they do it everyday of their lives; they're not mean to people like the 'cool kids' and they are the winners. Most hot guys will treat you like dirt however great you think they are.|`|8AxCruIYaa	:)|`|AA10186411	You are apparently young, so I am going to give you the best advice I can.  Just stop dating for a while.  Guys your age usually only want one thing from you.  If you have been giving it up, stop.  If you haven't, then good.  But like I said, you are young and have plenty of time left to date, so just focus on school right now.  I know its hard, but you will be alot happier in the end.  When the right guy comes along, you will know!|`|4DoXomHZaa	First step is stop hanging your ta-ta's out. It makes you LOOK gullible and easy and you will attract nasty boys.    Then open your eyes and be skeptical. Ask your mom and dad, they will tell you all the BS lines teen boys use to get in your drawers. it's too early to complicate your life with this stuff.    You catch the fish you hang the bait out for, and right now your appearance says you're trolling for carp.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	your true friends wouldn't do anything to hurt your feelings.  next time ask yourself, is this person a true friend?  if not, then walk away.  i don't know what this guy(s) got you to do or did to you, but next time walk away from him.    i used to be that way, and in the end i'd be standing there while people laughed at me.  i realized that the people i was hanging around weren't my real friends
0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	This sounds like deja vu...    My daughter is 8 years old. I informed her dad when she was born and he told me he was to young to be a dad. (He had just graduated from college and was taking a banking job) So, I shut him out. I never pursued it again until the last year. My daughter started asking questions so, I decided to make him answer them.    I filed for support, he asked for a DNA test. He never attended court, I got 100% custody and a substantial amount for support. Finally once custody and support was decided and he learned he was now paying a small fortune for her, he decided to come around.    He never had told his parents, friends or his wife. So, she has been slowly adjusting to her new family, but they aren't pushy at all. Heck the last time she say his parents was christmas. He only calls her once a week.    Once excitement wore off, the relationship has kind of fizzled.    **He can't take your son. They may award some parenting time to him, but he has to do some heavy explaining as to why he has been absent.     Stay strong!!    **Add me as a contact if you want any more help from me!|`|AkFag8tNaa	Don't worry, highschool games don't factor into custody. He is the dad and has rights (and those rights should be honored by you as the mother of his child) but he can't just come and take him. You need to speak w/a lawyer, he needs to speak w/one and you need to have documented items (birth certificate, ss card etc...)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	if it were me i would tell them MYSELF what a dead beat he was. maybe they could knock some sense into him. they can TRY ot take him but i doubt they will succeed|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Wow your story sounds just like my life lol. No there isn't much they can do to take your son away unless you are doing something neglectful to the child. If i were you i'd take the father to court for a DNA test done. So that his parents know for a fact that this child is in deed their grandchild. What they do with the information is up to them, but if they aren't going to be an active part of your son's life i would just ask them to just stay away.     But do the DNA put all minds at ease.|`|tHM6TjtIaa	I have to say be thankful they want to be active in his life, everyone makes mistakes in life and it is obvious he is young and made a huge mistake. One he will never be able to make up for, your son won't remember his absence but once he gets to know his little miracle he will forever regret the time he lost being stupid.     They cannot take your child from you, for 2 years you have proven that you are a good mother, and able to provide for your little guy without any assistance from him. However in the same breath please allow him and his family to be a part of your little boys life... It is only going to benefit him to know that so many love him!    This is tough and I know your mommy claws are wanting to come out and dig right into him but know that you can be there when he is with them until you are comfortable. YOU hold the cards and can only make life better for not only your little boy but make their lives so much more blessed with your little boys presence...    Best wishes!|`|p61Ccuvyaa	you know i would worry to but really you should let the child have something to do with the grandparents. go down to the courthouse if you have not already and get custody papaers.. give him and his family visitation on your terms supervised whatever the case may be..good luck|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Unless they could prove you are an unfit mother there is nothing they can do. Parental rights supersede grandparents rights. Whether they believe you or not is up to them but if they have any respect for the mother of their grandchild and really do want to be part of his life they shouldn't call you on it. They really shouldn't bring it up at all unless they do believe you. Just remember to be civil yourself. I know there is anger built up (I feel it everytime I hear my nephew talk about his dad who abandoned him for a few years and started a whole new life w/o him) but it won't get you anywhere. Best of luck to you and hopefully they will see their son for what he is.|`|82987c5133eb520901fdacb24b4dafb5aa	He sounds like a kid would just be in his way...no court will give him custody , he has never been there for him...does he pay support? Grandparents rights suck, so dont worry about that.  They will let him go there if YOU say it is ok..  good luck|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	Get a lawyer.    Get a DNA test immediately, court ordered if necessary to prove or disprove that this man is the father.    If he is the father, you will need to arrange the following:    (a) custodial agreement and visitation rights     (b) child support    (c) grandparents' rights {if that is honored in your state}    if necessary - (d) have the birth father sign over his rights totally if he has no desire to parent or participate in any way in this child's life.     Unless you are being neglectful of your son's needs, abusive towards him or a druggie, you shouldn't be stripped of parental rights automatically but be aware that we DO live in a litigious society and if they have money and are lawyered up and of a mind to be so injurious, they may sue for full custody.    You need legal representation.|`|w5sK75MPaa	No they can't take your boy away from you unless you are proved to be an unfit parent. Another thing is I assume you are not getting any child support from this jerk? If not then Id file some paperwork on him & make him pay you support for your son. Im sure you will have to submit a DNA test to prove the child is his. But all of that cost should be covered by the state you live in.  Just keep being a good mother and you will have nothing to worry about when it comes to them taking him away from you.  Things may get a lil ugly the next few months but in time it will all work out in the end. It may make your sons father grow up a little and he may be a decent dad for your son someday.
U49FhI05aa	First  tell him that they r ur frnds and u move close with them just like as u move close to ur son.Then he will think that my mom is close to them so no need to fear.Then he will slowly mingle with them.

If you haven't done this, then you will have difficulties.  If you have, then you will just have to be firm with him.  Does he have any learning disabilities, such as Asbergers syndrome?  That could make him reluctant to mix with others.|`|t6wid9xaaa	I am not a Parent but I have a little bother. If  the kid is not familiar with other human beings than you he might feel awkward, with other persons around.   Suggestion: Try getting your 3 year old to your friends kids parties so he ill Relate to others                   Get him on programs for kids, A place in which he be able to make friends.                   Don't Stay too much time with him! You are his mom and you want the best for him. He will cry a bit but he will get used to it.     Remember if your want to make your kid be part of the society you need to help him a bit if it is not natural from him!    Hope it work, and Good Luck!|`|WzKrZoHQaa	We Home educate so know the importance of outside activities.  He is too young for some but there are local grps for music, gym, etc contact yr local library as they do story sessions weekly and it will be a nice way to get him to mix.  Mums nd Toddlers too.  Again yr local library will have endless lists of things for toddlers in yr area with contact numbers etc.   Local churches have fab meetings with no pressure to join the congregation.    Yes he needs to mix more otherwise you are doing him no favours in the long run - sorry.|`|9b6a51f72b4ce44cd195fb24fccdaf8caa	I think I may have been scared of people too at times.

3Rr5SAhhaa	You can still be pregnant and not experience typical pregnancy symptoms. Some women go their whole pregnancy without feeling sore breasts, and nausea. It can vary from woman to woman. So don't lose hope yet, there is still a chance that you are pregnant.

e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	It depends on how regularly you went to the gyno to begin with.  If this is your first visit ever, then the doctor will do a pap smear and a general physical exam.  Don't worry, it's not painful, just a bit uncomfortable.      Then, they'll do the standard first prenatal appointment stuff.  They'll draw a few vials of blood so they can test you for all sorts of things.  They'll also ask you tons of questions about your history and your family history that relates to things they'll have to look for during your pregnancy.  They'll weigh you, check your blood pressure, and then you'll set up your next appointment which will be a month from now unless something comes up in your bloodwork or pap test.      It's really not that bad.  The worst part for me was when they drew my blood.  They have to get so much that first time that it takes a little while (not long, it just seems like it) and my arm got pretty uncomfortable.  But then it was over.      Oh, they might have you watch a short video too about prenatal health.  That's standard practice at my OB.  The video was really old, very 80's, and pretty funny.  So that tends to relax you if you are a bit nervous.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	Generally all they do is have you fill out about 5 pages of medical history, make you pee in a cup to test your urine for proteins, do a pap smear, and do some blood work. If you are close to 10 weeks they may listen for a heartbeat. They will schedule your next appointment for next month and probably your first ultrasound for 10 weeks. That is about it.|`|giKCTfnfaa	no reason to be scared.  just relax!      when you first go in, they will confirm your pregnancy. then they'll ask you about your medical history and that of the father if you know it.   they will check your blood pressure weight and may take several vials of blood. you'll be  sent to an exam room.  during the exam, they will do a breast exam and a pap.  the doctor will feel around on your stomach, checking the size of the uterus.  after the exam, you'll get dressed.  the dr or nurse will ask if you have any questions.  they will schedule your next appointment, give you a prescription for prenatal vitamins and probably send you home with some goodies and pamphlets.     at every appointment, they will check your weight, bp, urine, measure your belly and listen to the heartbeat.  they should ask at every appointment if you have any questions or concerns.|`|MO2H26XOaa	You will probably get a pap test. get asked a whole bunch of questions about your family, and his family, and get some blood drawn. The appointments get annoying, but you get used to them. Congrats, and good luck!|`|627pWyVkaa	you might get an ultra sound but sometimes they wait until your further along (depending how far you think you are). Medical history of you and your partner is always standard. Answer any questions you may have, probably tell you about themself (if you havent been to them before), see what support you need or have, urine test for glucose, protein, sometimes send it for uti's (to check), blood test for your typing, swabs, and std testing(some are standard) pelvic exam, to check your cervix and see everything looks ok or not.  Check your weight, and blood pressure(which they'll do at every appointment) Nothing to worry about, Make sure too bring all questions with you, and if your feeling sick already ask to get on medication! And if you want to know what are safe to eat, and what over counter medications you can take, is very handy to know!|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	They will probably do another pregnancy test just for their records, and they will get basic medical/sexual background on you. If it makes you more comfortable you can request that your mom(i'm assuming) wait outside. They should get you started on prenatal vitamins. Other than that not a whole lot will go on. Don't be nervous. I'm sure your mom understands how nervous you are. Good luck|`|ATb5iWoXaa	While your act the docters office consider getting brain surgery, maybe you wont be so dumb after words.

You have nothing else to do but have sex, I bet your gay boyfriend is going to leave if he finds out you have a baby rofl. You are the most  dumbest person on the internet I have ever met.

Normally, you don't have your first ultrasound until 20 weeks. I think it really sinks in that your pregnant when you hear the heartbeat for the first time. it really is an amazing experience. My favorite part was when I looked at my husbands face and saw this look on his face that I have never seen before. Happiness was pouring out of him! Congrats on your miracle!|`|giKCTfnfaa	to see everything was ok, was a great relief.  neither of my doctors did ultrasounds until at least 18 weeks unless there was a need for concern.  there is a feeling of overwhelming happiness.  be sure to grab some tissues!|`|AA10147946	I had one yesterday, at 8w2d.  They did it early because of a miscarriage in July.      It had to be the coolest thing I've ever seen in my entire life!  Feeling pregnant, and knowing I was pregnant was one thing, but seeing it made it "real" to me.  I saw (didn't hear yet) the heartbeat fluttering, it was wild.  I've really never seen anything that awesome in my life!    Good luck!!  You'll enjoy it, I promise =)|`|BKr3y30maa	The feeling can't even be described.  Wait and you will see how right I am! Congratulations by the way.  Have a Happy and Healthy pregnancy!|`|FMQbI5V9aa	I was so happy that I could have cried. The technician thought I was nervous but I wasn't. I was very emotional.

The baby has to be in the right position for the sex to be seen.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	Month 4-5, usually between 18 to 22 weeks.    We found out she was a girl at 18 weeks :)    Some find out earlier, like 16 weeks, but the later you wait the more accurate the result will be. (There's no guarantee of 100% accuracy in any case.)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Between weeks 16-22 is normally when doctors perform the sonogram but 20 weeks is the norm|`|WLtsumGBaa	i found out at 16wks|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	Between 18-22 weeks.

5DJcir9saa	The time definitely flew by!  So not only did it feel like I hadn't left work at all, but I felt like I didn't have enough time with my baby.  I took 2 months off and by time I'm ready to have another, I will be able to take 3 months off fully paid!  I'm so glad I'll get that extra time with the next one.  But yeah, I got right back into the swing of things =)|`|faPKwClPaa	Same for me!  I did keep up (as much as I could) with my email while I was at home, but yeah, overall, it was like I was out for only a week or so and not three months.    I don't know if that's a good or bad thing... ;-)|`|mDsFeDtcaa	I agree with you...feels like I never left! It's weird...some days I forget I have a baby! (as terrible as that sounds).  Life outside of work is very different (mainly going to bed at 8 and getting up at 5!)...but while I'm at work I'm the same independent, career oriented person I was before I was a mother!|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I worked as a nurse in a clinic and knew my patients very well. The first time I was on maternity leave I was out for almost 3.5 months. When I came back I had to catch up on everything that happened and get to know the new patients and the new problems my current patients were going through, I felt out of place for about a week, it was all a little overwhelming. The second maternity leave I was out for almost 5 months. I had much, much more responsibility this time. I ran an infusion clinic for patients with Multiple Sclerosis in addition to my nursing position with the physician and a nurse practitioner. The entire time I was on maternity leave I got calls about everything, at least twice per day. I even got a call while in the hospital after giving birth to my daughter, they couldn't reach me at home so they called my cell and when they didn't get an answer they called  my husband's cell. So when I returned I still felt like I had been there the entire time, even when I had been gone for so long. This time I will not be taking maternity leave as I am on permanent maternity leave as a SAHM!
2ARgi1rdaa	It is not puberty and certainly not precocious puberty either. Those conditions occur in older children like 9 year olds or 10 years olds and later, not infants. Your friends baby most likely has a hormone imbalance if the condition is not genetic. In many children this is considered normal, and usually corrects itself. Your friends certainly within their right to get a second opinion, and if they are that concerned over the issue that's what I would do.|`|GLnVPp2Caa	another thing to consider is that if he is still nursing, he is getting mom's hormones too.  for instance, some babies get pimples because of mom's hormones.    i think she should trust the doctor.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Is this a serious question?  Because I highly doubt he is going through that at 6 months old.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Common? Absolutely not. When this happens to children say 8 years of age, it causes all kinds of concerns, and it is a medical condition known as "precocious puberty".  They will probably do many blood tests , mainly to check hormone levels.
xy0W50Lqaa	I remember seeing a photo of Nicole Richie with her new born baby girl and they both looked so gorgeous I did feel a bit miserable that I didn't look that good! I had my little girl a few weeks after her and omg i looked dreadful.  It doesn't make them better mums but having professional stylists, nannies, chefs and personal trainers do help.  I know i'm a good mum, I don't mind getting up at 2am, 3m , 4m to comfort my baby instead of one of Jennifer Lopez's nannies.  I don't need a contract with Mothercare to show everyone what a good mum I am.|`|5f6XnInEaa	No, it makes me feel like a real mum.    I  was reading Woman's Day last weeks, and it turns out most of these 'Wondermums' are actually 'Wonder babysitters'    Angelina Jolie has 4 24 hours nannies, and each child has its own personal doctor.    Gweneth Paltrow has 2 nannies for her kids.    The point is, behind that flashy , family orientated facade is a team of nannies actually raising these kids.    Remember, they have all the money they need for lypo after there 37 weeks scheduled c-sections, so there babies don't get to big and thus cause more stretch marks.    I feel like a great mummy after ready about the Nanny hooplah!    I understand not all use nannies, but , well, neither do I.|`|nhhCow4haa	They dont make me feel depressed as i know that they probably have chefs, nutritionsits, personal trainers, nannies, stylists etc to help out. If i had all that stuff too i could probably look as good as they do|`|6cN8aLnaaa	It doesn't make me feel like a worse mommy, because I think to myself that they more than likely all have nannies that take care of the baby 90% of the time and they don't have to get up with baby at night like we do. I think we are the better mommies because we do it on our own. However, it is kinda depressing that I don't look the same as I used to but seeing a big smile on that little face makes the weight I gained so very worth it. :)|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	No, not at all. I raise my own kids... everything you see in the media is one big public relations eye blind. Once they're done with their photo op, the kids go right back to their nannies. They can run a marathon a few months later, because they had time to train! The rest of us run our daily marathons, picking up after our kids, doing their laundry, feeding them, playing with them, dressing them, changing their nappies... who has time to train for a marathon after all that?    On some level, I feel sorry for them. I don't envy them one bit. I kick celeb mommy *ss every day - I bet she won't be able to keep up with my boy for one day (without handing him off to a nanny).    Running a marathon... pssh.... I've run them, it's nothing special - if you have time to train and a bit of determination, anyone can run a marathon.    But raising a child, watching them grow up, seeing their first steps, hearing their first words, seeing their personalities develop. Now that's something special.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	Do you know what the vast majority of these celebrities do? They get planned C-sections at 37 weeks, so they will be the smallest they can be. (In a luxury room at a private hospital, usually.) Then they get a "mummy tuck" while they are having the C-section in the same operation- a tummy tuck. That is why they look so great after. Not to mention the TEAM of people doing their hair, makeup, personal shoppers picking the most flattering designer clothing, nannies looking after the babies so they can rest and work out (with an on-call personal trainer, yoga guru, etc.) Oh! And they have a dietician and personal chef who will make them delicious, low calorie meals whenever they want according to the latest Hollywood fad diet.     Then they get $100,000 dresses to wear on the red carpet and pose at the most flattering angle.     And then the pictures in those magazines are airbrushed and the celebrities are digitally slimmed.     No, that doesn't make me feel ugly. If I had all that, I might look darn near sexier than some of them! We all would! :D|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	No it doesn't t make me feel worse mom to see celeberity moms.  I actually kind of feel bad for those mom's since they often work out for many hours a day with their personal trainer soon after the babies birth because they feel the pressure to lose the baby weight (not spending a lot with baby nanny's do allot of the baby care).

MtC3CWZraa	A 31 day cycle is no big deal. Assuming you ovulate exactly at the mid point of your cycle, you'd ovulate 1-2 days after someone with a 28 day cycle.     I have a 30 day, and seem to have gotten pregnant right around the middle of my cycle.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I have 31 day cycles and I normally ovulate between day 16 and 19.  When you have longer cycles you don't ovulate close to your period because once you ovulate you will get your period 10-14 days later and result in short cycles.  If you don't get the eggwhite mucus around ovulation time but have a high cervix then definitely try pre-seed.

u0mZAPuDaa	It is fine!    Every baby is different.    My daughter is nine months and she sleeps about 17 hours in a 24 hour day.    She sleeps about 12 hours at night and around five hours worth of naps in the day.|`|wy7YkwIEaa	Hey I really wouldn't worry about this - my son was the same at this age even though he was a very active baby. Nowadays it takes me to get him out of his bed lol. The professional advice is that babies should have 12 hours sleep per night but remember all children are different. If you do have serious concerns about it though try speaking to your health visitor to see what she says (hopefully yours will be more helpful than mine was)!     Good luck x|`|q4yfbhODaa	That's about the same for my eight month old.|`|XSBsomfVaa	I think it's normal. Only newborns sleep all day. My nephew, at that age, would never go to sleep. He would stay up late, get up early and only took one nap. Your baby could just be too excited to sleep also. When they are around new people they get excited and refuse to sleep.|`|b3701715d7f2027b9badd9cfdd2154fcaa	That's very normal!  My daughter is 11 weeks old and experts advise that she could be awake for up to 10 hours a day already and she's living up to it!  I think your baby is doing fine!|`|ay8tXLD2aa	Textbook wise, no it isn't.  Babies of that age "should" be taking 2 naps a day of 1.5 to 2 hours long and sleeping 10 to 12 hours at night.  Sadly, not all babies read these same textbooks!  If your baby is content, not overtired (always cranky, fussy, etc) and sleeping well at night, then there's not much more you can do about it. If she isn't sleeping well at night, then you could try getting another hour nap in during the day - good day sleep in a baby encourages good night sleep.       A consistent bedtime and consistent nap times will help set her biological clock.  At this age she should probably go down for her morning nap 3 to 3.5 hours after waking, and then take a good hour to two hour long nap. Then again, up for 3 to 3.5 hours and another good long nap. A set bedtime between 630 - 8pm is about the time when babies naturally tire.     But, as I said, some babies forgot to read the right books -- I know mine certainly did!|`|RIRyRNEeaa	Very Normal... All babies are different.
KHZLPldraa	My daughter is 17 months and she is cutting her stomach teeth and will run a fever one day then not the next.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	That tells me that they just didn't accurately take her Temperature.     Where did they take the temperature and how many times.  Sometimes its best to take their temperature a few times, especially when you get a false reading.  If they did it under the arm, its very easy to not have it positioned correctly or for long enough.  Plus, you are suppose to add one degree to a under the arm reading.   Also, a low grade thermometer makes it harder to get an accurate temperature.    I wouldn't worry, I just think they didn't take her temperature correctly or get an accurate temperature.
lkhCeAdJaa	All opinions aside, there is absolutely NOTHING any court of law would do about what you describe.  A swat on the butt is not illegal (assuming you do not live in a country where spanking IS illegal) and nothing would be done.  CPS can do nothing without proof of abuse.  If you didn't abuse her (and what you describe isn't abuse) they have no proof.  If they have no proof, they have no case.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	Well if he calls CPS they will make your life very difficult.   If explain that she had continued to touch the stove area despite your removing her, telling her no, and the swat was to get her attention so she would not get hurt they cannot do anything. Especially if there are no bruises, history of abuse, etc.  Judges/courts rarely take children away from their mothers unless she has been deemed unfit. Swatting your child on the bum once for disobeying and to keep her away from danger does not classify an unfit mother.  He's hanging around, probably noting every single thing that happens so he can try to get custody away from you. It may be best to separate until the divorce is final.|`|1da22694eee1f6055b5ea295d06bcf40aa	Sounds like he is being a jerk. I watch your back while he is around. You never know what kind of crap he will pull on you to take her away from you.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	What you did was fine.  CPS does not remove children due to a spanking and the courts will see it the same way.|`|aXYiOskmaa	well, you didn't use the skillet.right?  he's just being an ***, they will not take your custody for swatting your child's butt.|`|rcdTluUjaa	Check into the laws in your area, just to be safe, and be careful when he is around, where I live it is perfectly legal to give up to 2 swats on the butt with an open hand. Honestly how you discipline is up to you, but in my opinion there was nothing innapropriate about swatting her for her own safety. All you did was instill in her that you mean NO when you say no, and honestly good for you.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Maybe pull her away.And that still does not prove you are an unfit parent.He would have to prove That you are unfit.I would pull her away gently next time.|`|MeYILJeSaa	You aren't unfit for swatting your child on the bottom. He's an idiot. CPS is not going to take your child away for swatting her on the bottom because she was putting herself in danger.
YjeehK9Jaa	Congrats!!  You must make sure all of your meats are well cooked including red meat.. seafood.. and even eggs.

They both came in handy!! If you doubt anything- medicines, cleaners, etc. Pregnancy Do's and Don'ts lists them and tells whether they are harmful or not.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	One of the best things you can do is get the book, What to Expect When You're Expecting. It's an excellent book. Takes you through your pregnancy week by week and answers so many questions. It's very nicely written so it gives facts to all sides but doesn't force you into a way of thinking, just gives all the information. There is also a book that my husband got call What to Expect When You're Wife's Expanding and he loves it. It is written in a very comical way and gives them just enough information to interest them but doesn't weigh them down with a ton of facts. Good luck to you!|`|X1ACfL8eaa	Congrats! You will get so many tips from people, my only tip is enjoy your pregnancy! Just use common sense, and your baby should be fine. If you don't trust your common sense just ask your doctor for a list of do's and don'ts, but trust me many many people are going to take it upon themselves to fill you in how to be pregnant. All you have to do is relax more and stay healthy. Good Luck!|`|XsKXmXsJaa	Here are a few things that I suggest doing.    1. Enroll in the antenatal classes that are offered by your hospital/ birthing center etc, these classes will help you to be prepared for the actual labour and also breast feeding.    They make you aware of your options with pain relief and give you an opportunity to meet with people who are around the same stage of pregnancy as you who you can share advise, tips and even form friendships with, for all you know they may even be in the hospital the same time as you.    2. Check out sites and forums that are focused around trying to conceive, parenting and pregnancy, I have found that the people on these forums are gold in relation to advice and support.    There is also heaps of information in relation to each stage of pregnancy, what to expect and even parenting sections in many of them.    3. Magazines are the next best thing. You will have plenty of time during your pregnancy where you just want to curl up on the lounge or in bed with a magazine.    There are many magazines around that not only focus on pregnancy but they also focus on things such as babies first year, illnesses, maternity wear and even information on how early to book into schools, childcare etc.    I was surprised at the fact that if you had a particular school in mind that was popular you need to plan these things before the baby is even born!    4. Books, the best book I have read that is informative yet also comedic is written by Kaz Cooke and is called Up the duff.    This book outlines pregnancy month by month, including what to expect, what to plan for, what tests will be performed and other things that make you feel normal and not the only one who is going through a particular thing.    Kaz also follows up with a book on Kid wrangling which I am yet to read but I will not hesitate in buying.    5. Parents and mothers, although all the advice they give you will not be what you want to hear or may not be the way in which you want to do things, some of the advice from your parents will be priceless.    Something my mum told me the other day was so simple yet so important I realized that without other peoples advice I would not know a lot of the things I know today.    Although I do not feel as though I am at all prepared for the sleepless nights, the endless nappies and the first times for everything.    I think that with the above sources of advice and information have provided me with priceless information that Im sure will help me when the time comes in 3 months.    You can read more tips what to do and what not to do here: http://www.thebeautyonline.com/blog/cate...|`|BQYXgtq7aa	There is so much out there that says you shouldnt do this or shouldnt do that... Use your own instincts as well as advice from well known doctors, etc and trusted family and friends.  I would say do not drink alcohol, do drugs (illegal) or smoke tobacco products. Dont breathe the smoke of those who do.  Sometimes people feel sick from chilli.  Banana's are meant to be good for morning sickness.  Read lots of books, see videos about giving birth and parenting.   Be prepared that all your prepared for just wont be enough or wont be right.  Dont lift anything to heavy; dont lift/carry things against your stomach.  Dont wear pressure bandages on your legs.  In later pregnancy, take it easy. Rest when tired, eat when hungry, drink regularly, exercise regularly, put your feet up when able. Its completely normal to be nervous and anxious. Its hard to know what to expect, but reading and watching things about pregnancy, childbirth and parenting can in the least help you feel more prepared.  Buy things in advance for baby. Such as newborn sized nappies, cot/crib/bassinet, car seat, pram, rugs, bottles if formula feeding, breast pump if planning on breast feeding, maternity pads, breast pads (for any leakage between feeds), a digital camera is a great idea, a baby bag, change table, baby bath, etc... Not all is neccessary, for instance, you could change the baby on your bed, providing baby is never left unattended or close to edge.   Perhaps see if you have a friend, neighbour of family member you could spend a day or so with helping with their newborn/toddler, it would be a great learning experience for you and a huge help to the mother of the baby/ies.  If you are concerned about anything to do with the baby, at any stage, no matter how little or unimportant it seems, see your GP, health nurse or ring a parenting or health line for parents or pregnant women.  Filter any and all advice you get from everyone (including well meaning friends and relatives) and use your instincts and common sense on what is right for you (and your baby).    Good luck.

No raw or undercooked eggs (mayo! make sure raw eggs werent used, mousses, ect ect)  No cold cuts of meat, always heat them up.  Make sure all your food is piping hot.  Don't eat ready made meals, so many chemicals in them.  Always eat fresh, only you know what your putting in your food.    Don't do heavy excersise, but light excersise. Like walking, gentle swimming, gentle yoga, ect ect.     If you have a cat, clean cat litter with a mask and gloves, toxins are harmful. The cat itself is fine to be around.     Thats pretty much it. Theres always loads of thing not to do. Just trust your doctor.    Oh I forgot the obvious, no drugs, no smoking and do not drink!    Don't read 'what can go wrong in your pregnancy' I did, and I was a nervous wreck for 2 weeks!!    GOOD LUCK!!!   Its not as daunting as it sounds. Hope I helped. xxx
AA10976951	Yep, I had morning sickness really bad and could keep nothing down for a while and my doctor told me that I could take Flintstones because at least them being chewed up would get them into my system faster.  Ask you doctor to see how many a day you should take, I forget what my doctor said...but my morning sickness finally got under control and I didn't have to use Flintstones.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I used flintstone vitamins instead of prenatal because the prenatal vitamins made me sick. My doctor said it was fine.|`|KWPnoqGMaa	u need to go to the doctor if you are and see what vitamins are ok for you.|`|qiLKlSmHaa	Go to the doctor and ask about vitamins for pregnant women...they generally have many more vitamins and minerals that are good for you and the baby.  Flintstones are really kids vitamins...they generally have less amount and less number overall vitamins and minerals than a regular adult should get getting, nevermind a pregnant one.
nFqfUVPJaa	I had this towards the end, I thought my water had broken and it was just a small leak. I even went in and got tested for amniotic fluid! In the end no it was not my waters but discharge and I did not go into labor either, I had to be induced...twice....  Just start wearing pads if you are not already and pray you go into labor when you are meant to!    Good Luck|`|X2G8EHBlaa	most likely your water broke or your leaking fluid...you need to go see the doc or go to labor and delivery and get checked asap|`|WPI0Z47saa	I have had that discharge my whole pregnancy. I don't think it is because labor is coming on. But you are really close. I am sure you are ready to have this over with. It will come soon enough. Good luck.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Discharge is normal throughout your entire pregnancy.  Bloody show is a good sign of oncoming labor.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	I dont think so. Ive had a white discharge ever since ive been pregnant. Anything brown or bloody could be your mucus plug & that is a sign of labor.|`|ViZUiEgxaa	if its just white don't worry too much but if its also bloody its your mucus plug. be careful cuz your water could break soon after that and you'll be in labor. good luck and god bless
MtC3CWZraa	Go to WhatToExpect.com and they lay out what you need to eat.     To be honest, I find it a little lofty but if you're willing to choose health over cravings it's probably doable.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	You never diet when you are pregnant    You eat good  No fast food  No fried foods  No Junk foods  No soda   No caffeine    You eat health  You exercise, or at least walk    If you cheat, you do it with things like 60 to 100 calories puddings  Low calories food  Fruit and veggies, be careful with dip    You never diet when you are pregnant|`|JgpyfuuWaa	Your pre-natal vitamin is a must.  The folic acid is crucial, especially at this stage.  Add in some dark green leafy, fortified cereals for even more folic.  Iron is also very important, if you can stomach a vitamin that includes iron, that's a plus.  At least 3 servings of calcium a day is recommended (milk, yogurt, safe cheeses).   Constipation can be an issue during pregnancy, so upping the fiber is also a good idea (brown rice, cereals, beans, fruits, veggies).   Protein helped me alot with morning sickness, and your need for it increases - milk, eggs and lean meats, even protein shakes you make at home are a good source.  Staying hydrated is important, water first and foremost, apple juice, OJ.   This is not the time for dieting, keeping some fat in your diet is very important.        The big don't's are certain types of fish high in mercury (shark, swordfish, mackerel) other types of fish can be consumed in moderation, unpasteurized products, soft cheeses and certain cold cuts and cold meats can be a source of listeria which is a dangerous bacteria.  .      You don't have to be totally rigid about this daily, just try to make the best choices you can make for you and your baby - and don't forget to indulge a bit sometimes!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Honestly, we do not know your medical history, any diet etc should be given to you by your OBGYN.     He will know how much weight you should gain, if you are underweight etc.     And if you google pregnancy do's and don't you will get a million great websites to help you.    Good luck.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	diets are a no no during pregnancy. just watch what you eat and you wont gain a lot of weight. no soda, junk food, etc.    don't, obviously, smoke, drink, or do drugs.    do take your prenatal vitamin. do drink plenty of water, juice, and milk.    limit tuna and other sea food.. avoid shark and some other fish you probably aren't eating anyway.  there are some cheeses you should avoid but i don't remember the names of them. i had never heard of any of them anyway.    do stock up on toilet paper as you'll be peeing a lot!  do go to www.babycenter.com to get weekly updates on your pregnancy and the stages of you baby.    and then come here anytime you have a question.. as long as its not "i'm gushing blood from my vagina.. what could this be?!" any question like that will get you rude comments as you should be on your way to the hospital.     good luck and congratulations!!|`|ROJans2Taa	I ate tons of fruits and berries, ive read to avoid unripe papaya's however (apparently they can cause contractions). I would eat lean meats, drink lots of water. avoid process meats and soft cheeses. I enjoyed my pregnancy, id eat tons of healthy things during the day then at night  enjoy a huge ice ream cone, and id also treat myself to some danishes while working,lol. as long as your main meals are healthy feel free to indulge a little.  oh also, I did gain 42 lbs, but my son was 8lbs 7ounces, and 5 mths later im back to normal.best luck|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	The general rule of thumb is to not eat raw meat, eggs, seafood, no shark or swordfish, and low amounts of tuna.  Other than that just eat lots of fruits, veggies, and chicken.|`|fHgbL046aa	The thing to stay away from or limit yourself is caffeine and no deli meat unless you cook it first. You want to eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Do not smoke,drink or do drugs. If you have any concerns contact your doctor and they can put your mind at ease. Good Luck and you can come out of hiding now LOL|`|dXMdt3gVaa	Congratulations!     Firstly you should cut out all sodas, caffiene, alcohol, tobacco, and any medicines that are not prescribed by your doctor. If you are on prescription medication and its not from your OBGYN make sure you contact the prescibing doctor to let them know you are now pregnant. But ideally (in a perfect world) you should not be on any medications other than your prenatal vitamin.     If you have a headache, sore throat, fever etc, you can take tylenol (acetominophen) and Tylenol ONLY. Ibuprofen, aspirin, etc can cause your babies heart to become deformed. So its VERY serious. Some OBGYNs do prescibe aspirin for high blood pressure but they are very low doses and not like your regular pop two aspirins for a headache kind of thing.     If youre constipated dont use laxitives. Rather eat prunes.     You should consume between 2500 and 2700 calories per day. Mostly I would say you should cook at home. That way you can make sure your food is fresh and has not been standing around. Doctors recommend you stay away from cold meats, ham etc because of listeria which is a bacteria that can make you very sick. Also those meats have lots of nitrates which are harmful for the baby.     So meals like roast chicken, veggies, potatoes, salad, lean beef, rice, and grains are great for you. Stay away from hamburgers, take way foods etc because they also have a lot of sodium which can lead to edema. Edema is swelling of the soft tissues which can make your ankles etc painful. Also fast foods are just full of fat and they lack good nutrients and roughage. I literally become betty crocker and cook everything from scratch. No 'box' dinners (unless I am exhausted and its a once in a blue moon thing!). Box dinners have so many preservatives etc. Try to eat fresh food, perishables that go off in a couple days are the types of things you should be eating anyways. Anything with a shelf life, you probably want to avoid.     Make sure you take your prescription prenatal vitamin daily and that you drink lots of milk or have orange juice fortified with calcium.     Dont sit in hot baths, dont go bike riding, dont go trampolining, horse riding, etc... dont jump into swimming pools, dont do anything that could force water up into your vagina (like water skiing). But do go on a daily walk, rest as soon as you become tired. If you are quite fit you can still continue to go to gym etc but just tone it down and ask a trainer for exercises that compliment pregnancy. Yoga is great for pregnancy!     More than that, dont go into hiding! You will be fine. You will have fun. You will love feeling the life inside of you and this will be a very wonderful and rewarding experiend. Probably the HARDEST thing you will ever do in your life, but also the most amazingly wonderful thing as well!     Just use good common sense and follow your instincts. You will be fine!|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Just eat healthy, well balanced meals. No Alcohol, No Drugs, No raw meats, Not too many sweets & Not too much caffeine.    Fruits  Veggies  Whole grains  Lean Meats  Lots of calcium (Yogurt, Cheese, Cereal)  Also drink lots of water.    Congrats & Good Luck :)
28fNd725aa	I would say if you are that worried about it get a DNA test.  But ... since both guys already now, and it doesn't sound like the other guy is intersted in being part of your sons life... think about what might happen if you find out it is the other guy.  Remember it takes more then sperm to be a daddy and since your boyfriend has stepp'd up and is fathering your child... .what more could you want for you son!!     Congrats and best of luck in your decision!|`|KHZLPldraa	I conceived my daughter the last week in August and my due date was May 20th, and I went into labor on May 20th!|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	Maybe you should leave well enough alone. If you're very concerned you should count back 9 months from when you had the baby. Thats when he was conceived-assuming he wasn't under weight or under developed like a premie might be when he was born.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You definately did not get pregnant in October.  To have a due date of April 26th you would have got pregnant at the very end of July or the very beginning of August.|`|BzCYQlcuaa	ok you might think im crazy but call 1-888-45-maury!  they help you tell him and they also so a free test! thats what i would do! but i dont know if your that type to put your business out there. but its nice to tell someone   in a place where they cant run away! just a thought! :)  god bless|`|cj7sSPZEaa	It sounds like the baby is from the guy you are with right now based on the dates.  Is he willing to do a paternity test to be sure?  Maybe you should ask him to do one because you have doubts.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	I would answer this the way i want to, but i don't want to lose 10 points! So I will just say... DNA test! (or cleft chin... if either of the dad's has a cleft chin and so does the baby's, it's that man's baby. Cleft chin's are 100% hereditary)|`|q1Swxe3qaa	Do a DNA test. But if one doesn't think he is the father and one does, then just leave it be. As long as your baby has a great father, then DNA shouldnt matter!|`|rnTNu6MTaa	Sounds like ur boyfriend might be the father but i would do a DNA test just to take the doubt away :)|`|OBn4a7rzaa	I was at cvs buying a pregnancy test back in november, and they have over the counter paternity tests there! I dont know how it works, or how accurate it is, but i would assume they wouldnt sell it if it was accurate enough. It was like 30 dollars (i think) and i couldnt believe they just had it on the shelf like that, lol. If you boyfriend knows the situation, just tell him you would feel so much better if he did one. OR you can just accept the fact that he wants the child to be his, and go with that instead of wondering.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	...get a dna test to get this problem/situation off your mind|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It sounds like it's your bf's but I would get a paternity test just to be sure.|`|vjsT8DMIaa	May 7th..what a wonderful day!! :) My daughter was born May 7th, 2003. Anyways, about your question....I conceived at the end of august and was originally due May 20th...If you were due April 26th, that means you probably got pregnant the very end of July, to early August. If you were with your ex during those times, it is a possibility, BUT if you were with your current BF during those times...its more than likely his. Im glad you have a stand up man in your life...and just ask him if he wants a paternity test....if he's going to be in little mans life regardless and be his daddy, then why would it even matter. But anyways, congrats again.....and its not embarrassing...its totally understandable!! We're only human! ;)|`|627pWyVkaa	It wouldnt of been octobers no. However since you slept with both guys in july it could be either, since you do not know when you conceived. I would get a paternity test done to be honest and set your own mind at ease and you dont need the other guy (ex) anyways if your boyfriends matches and or doesnt then you know whos the biological father is. However its good to know maybe for medical reasons, but your boyfriedn loves your baby and is treating him like his own, Id say your really lucky! Id get the paternity test, I mean if you were on and off then you didnt cheat and he already knows the situation, I would just save up and get it done :)      Im sure you could go to some place with your boyfriends toothbrush or hair brush and do a test privately without him knowing, ? maybe I dont know just incase you dont want to ruin what you have, but it doesnt sound like your bf is that kind of a guy!|`|m8aqAZgJaa	Sounds to me that your boyfriend is the father. If you have doubts why dont you do a paternity test?|`|OuaZBkU9aa	It doesn't sound like your ex could be the father.  But I would get a paternity test so you can put your mind at ease.  Trust me I had a similar situation and until you know for sure it will always be something you think about.|`|f3JUERf5aa	did you know they make over the counter paternity tests...  it's an easy way to find your answer w/o the big dr. bill....|`|qh1NHD4Oaa	Do a DNA test|`|SLSX6QQsaa	I can't follow your story but why not swab the suspected fathers mouth in his sleep as well as your sons, and send it in for a DNA test without telling anyone?  You can pick them up at CVS!|`|fHgbL046aa	To put your mind at ease is to get the test done.  However, you can leave it be. Your boyfriend has stepped up to be this child's father and that is wonderful since some guys run out on women once there pregnant.(No that hasn't happened to me).  Its your choice but it may constantly bother you until you get the test one. You could go on Maury and have a free trip to Chicago if you want to. Just kidding I'm sure your boyfriend is the father. Just enjoy your baby and have fun.|`|f46ed724435ac2ee47d248b74aef9b48aa	Honestly, your dates can vary by weeks. I'd get the test to ease your worries, otherwise you will always wonder and that is not fair to anyone in the situation.|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	I would do a DNA test thats the only way you will find out. And sooner or later they will find out. Its best to find out now and get it over with. best of luck to you. :o)|`|XyRzSzjtaa	id be embarassed aswell, how same ful as you dont know who the dad is. bad, bad, bad i feel sorry for both men. take my advice only sleep with the man you are with, that y we call them ex bf becuz its an ex. total shame full|`|bpAJs76Uaa	DNA TEST IS THE BEST WAY|`|rYQCtRGgaa	Your ex couldn't be the father. Your boyfriend is right if you conceived in october you would be due in july/august. I put october into this ovulation cycle i kept changing the days to see what your due date would be and it was july/august. I used 28 days for how long your cycle is because it's most common that's how I know your boyfriend was right. I put down the website so you can try it for yourself. And if you don't feel 100% sure have paternity test done. GOOD LUCK!!
ESWdyM6Haa	As a concept, it useless to do things for or to a child that they can't, won't or don't understand. If YOU think she won't understand the concept, then she's too young!|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	When my 2 kids were one i told them no, and they listened. At around 16-17 months i used time-out that's when they started to hit and push.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Now would be a good time. 1 minute for every year. She will be responsive to it.|`|AA11790521	Time out is meant to make a child reflect upon their error. 2 yrs old is usually a good age to begin time out. However you have to remember to discuss what it is they did wrong with them or it will just be punishment rather than a learning experience. Another rule of thumb is 1 minute per year of age. I was a preschool teacher for a number of years and have an early childhood development degree, and that is what we were always instructed to do.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	At 1 the best form of discipline is redirection.  http://www.familyeducation.com/whatworks...  http://www.parentingtoddlers.com/toddler...     Our daughter struggled at that age learning to be kind to our family dog. We went for the old fashioned stand in the corner, where together we counted to 10. The Joke is that she counted to 20 with great ease way before her peers. Sometimes we dont even see her do it but when she pulls the dogs tail or tries to ride him like a horse, she puts herself in the corner and counts.|`|3gDiRoNwaa	I think you should do it when you realize that they understand what u r saying and no right from wrong and can tell u what they r being punished for. At 6 and 7 mnths old they start to realize what no and stop means when you say it so by two the shoud really be able to understand time out.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	actually, children and babies understand more than we think.  i started my daughter at 1.  you simply give a stern "NO" and take her from the situation that she was doing wrong and sit her somewhere.  At that age, i used my lap because i could control exactly what she was doing.  when she got closer to 2, she sat on the sofa by herself.  now that she's 3 1/2, i just say to go sit and she will pick a spot, but the argument now is sitting still and not lounging.      another thing, you said about her not understanding the concept.  no one understands concepts and ideas until they are taught.  it's your job to help her to understand things as she grows.  if you begin speaking to her like an adult or normal person (no baby talk) now, as her language skills develop, they'll develop better and she'll be able to understand you sooner.  just a thought.|`|cu9CZK60aa	This is definatly thhe best time to put your daughter into time out. Give her one minute for each year and start over every time she gets up. It may seem as if it doen't work at first, but she will catch on.

But those who wait, get better.. =]|`|M5HyStReaa	it depends how many you want and what your priorities are now.    Make sure you are both in agreement with timing of kids and what you want to do.

Some people like to have children early, like my husband and I and some prefer to wait until they are a bit older. Nothing wrong with either choice, it's very personal and very individualized choice. Let me also say that having children didn't stop us from traveling. We love traveling and going on vacations. We have two children, 3 years and 17 months and another on the way. We take trips all the time. In the next 4 months we have 2 trips/vacations planned. One to Montana which is about 1600 miles from where we live. It takes a little longer to get to where we are going with children, we drive, but it is still loads of fun! So don't let children stop you from traveling, just take them with! Our 3 year old has been on more vacations/trips than my nephew who is 16 years old!|`|113f7def65ef6156127ed1eda75e725faa	No, not at all.
1kZenfZzaa	Usually you can take a bottle away slowly, only giving them at nap time and such and then slowly finding other things at nap time to take their minds off of the bottle. Using sippy cups and praising them for using them.  Keep bottles out of sight so they don't think of them so much.      If you do just take away all at once, you are going to hurt her feelings.  I'm not saying you shouldn't do it, mom knows best, but she won't be a happy girl.      Good luck!|`|Ki5xSgmGaa	You can slowly wean her off the bottle.  I wouldn't take it away suddenly.  Start by eliminating the morning bottle first.  Offer solid food for breakfast first before offering liquids in a cup.  Then after she's used to no bottle in AM, maybe for a few weeks, eliminate the nap bottle.  The nighttime bottle should be the last to go. I have twins and I let them have a night bottle until they were 2 just so they would relax and get to sleep better.  Just don't let them fall asleep with the bottle in the mouth, it can cause dental decay and ear infections.|`|v0596BTeaa	Clearly it is going to hurt her feelings.  If I were you I would not make an issue of it, but would let her go on having her bottle for a while.|`|9uHjyameaa	Tell her that cows would really love to have her bottles, and you and her bag all of them up, go to a field of cows and lay the bag of bottles down for the cows and then leave, she will feel great about herself giving her bottles to the cows, do not bring another bottle into the house and she will have no choice but to drink out of a big girl cup, and of course later you can go back and retrieve the bottles and dispose of them properly. Stick to your guns mom.|`|suLTN10laa	You are not going to like my answer, but...  You are not going to "hurt her feelings"  she doesn't know any better.  She may cry because she is not getting her way, but you ARE NOT hurting her.  If you give it to her, then not give it to her, or give it to her only certain times this is confusing to her, and send mixed signals and she will only cry worse over time.  Just throw them away and make a HUGE DEAL over a brand new sippy with her favorite character on it.  She will give in eventually and when she does, praise her like no other.  When she asks for the bottle, do not get upset with her simply explain bottles are for babies and she's a big girl now and give her the sippy, every time.  Consistency is KEY!  Good luck!!|`|58a1dfc0dc5b252c83aa446e785f7547aa	take away during the nap time     or give to her only in her room and slowly give her the sippy cup.     I did that with pacifier use. So try that way  or just take away tops.    she does want you take away because the bottle just drips and sippy cup you have to suck to get what in the sippy cup.

1SGl03Zlaa	Walmart in the US has them, but I haven't seen them anywhere in Canada either.  You may be able to purchase them online (not on walmart.com though, they won't ship to Canada).  Otherwise your best bet would probably be to take a shopping trip over in the US, I go to Port Huron (other side of Sarnia) shopping often, its not a far drive from Hamilton and the stuff over their is so much cheaper than it is here its worth the drive for the deals I get.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Have you tried e-bay?|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I know we have that stuff here at Wal-Mart in the states. You might want to check out ebay|`|lYsrCTCwaa	If you know anyone that sews, you could probably find bolts @ a fabric store.
yOyg3gnJaa	It could be implantation bleeding, but from that small amount of information, it's hard to tell.  Take a HPT if you end up being late.  Good luck!|`|1thElV58aa	you started your period early, when your  18 and older your period will be more regular and on time. Since your probably a teenager your periods will be irregular your awhile.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Its blood....|`|gBDNbzJ2aa	a little dot? your a worrier like me..   id question it too.. it could have been there when your undies were clean :)  just dont worry about it.. if your not gushing out anything lmao TMI sorry.....let it go :) your alright..    37 weeks pregnant!
WdvLcYaVaa	Sorry hunny, buy if its still negative you are more than likely not pregnant. A positive would almost definitely show up by now. Sounds like your period is just messed up. In either case it would probably be best to see a doctor.
nFqfUVPJaa	if you look at an anatomy picture of the female body you can see that the uterus is located BELOW the pubic bone. And it will be until you are about 3 months pregnant. For it to be near your belly button you would have to be about 6 months.    What you are talking about sounds like a cyst, and if you consume a lot of caffeine they are probably caffeine aggravated cysts. I have these all over my body, from my ears to spine and inside my knee. They are not dangerous but a doctor would tell you to lay off the caffeine.     Caffeine itself will not affect the pregnancy test but drinking too much will dilute the urine and cause false negatives.  By 12 weeks you would get an easy positive no matter what, but if you were you should be going to the doctors now anyway so you should make an appointment and get a blood test done.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	The caffeine wouldnt cause your levels to be low but it is possible that you just arent very far along yet and your levels are still too low for a urine test to pick up on. As far as the belly button thing Im not even sure what you are talking about with that. Hope this helps.|`|sEFmjAJkaa	Go to the Doctor & get a BLOOD TEST, that test will show you, if you are, or aren't......|`|nMzzwrtUaa	its highly unlikely but wouldn't be the first time i heard of it either all i can suggest is you go tot eh doctors and ask for a blood test not a pee test for the main reason there is a more active hormone  in your blood that even if really low it only appears when you are pregnant.|`|yOyg3gnJaa	I really don't think caffeine makes your hormone level decrease. Some possible reasons of having a negative HPT but being pregnant would be that you possibly tested too early.  How late are you?  Take another test tomorrow morning when you first wake up, or wait a few days if you don't want to take tests everyday, and relax, don't freak out.  Good luck!|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	if you think youre pregnant you shouldnt be drinking Alot if any caffine|`|EAzyjftKaa	Not shure but talk to your doctor if he thinks you are pregnant he will have them do a blood test to see if you really are. If you are ttc it can be all on your head.|`|f1efa317fe3139e94297478f9b6af987aa	i have 3 kids, go to a doc now.|`|CAAcoqtYaa	ooooh Caffine.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	I have never heard of that, but if you are taking a home pregnancy test too early your hcg levels can be too low to detect you are pregnant.  For a better result go to the doctor and get a blood test done, or wait a few more days and take another test.|`|qGQCLFinaa	honestly, i'm not sure...... how long has it been since you missed your period? I know the longer you're pregnant the higher your levels go up, so maybe wait a couple days & take another, or go in to the doctor & have them test or do a blood test.  I drink a lot of caffeine too...... but i was 14 weeks along when i found out so..... good luck!|`|0722e5ddd4c6c3cb4e310338f3c85935aa	You need to cut the caffeine! It is not good for the baby and may lead to a lot of problems. Go to the dr. Good Luck!|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	I don't think that caffeine has anything to do with it. Early in pregnancy, your hormone levels can be low, and pregnancy tests vary WIDELY in their ability to detect hcg levels. The real question is, have you missed your period yet? Give it a week until after the date of your missed period, then test with a test like First Response. If it is negative, wait another week and take a second test. "They" say that you should test first thing in the morning, too. Belly buttons have nothing to do with detecting pregnancy either.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I have honestly never heard of that. I thought that the only way HCG was present in your blood was if you WERE pregnant. I don't think that caffeine plays any role in that. I am not sure how far long you think that you are but I got my first positive like 2 days before my missed period and even then I was still in denial because it was just so incredibly faint that I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. So maybe you just tested too early. Although when it was official that I had missed my period the line was a little darker but still pretty light. Anyway, your best bet sounds to be like just visiting your doctor and having some blood work done to be on the positive side... maybe he can tell by the symptoms and everything you are having!!! Anyway, good luck and get checked out! If you do have a little one you want to make sure that everything is going ok :)|`|xzh8r0jIaa	I THINK THAT IF YOUR THAT FAR ALONG YOU SHOULD DEFINIATELY GET A POSITIVE RESULT BACK REGARDLESS|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Even if you were pregnant you wouldn't have anything going on with your belly button because the uterus doesn't' get that high until week 20 or so.  And caffeine has nothing to do with hcg|`|yW9R8mapaa	What does your belly button have to do with anything? And if you think you might be pregnant, it's not a good idea to drink a lot of caffeine. How long has it been since you've had a period? You could be pregnant and your levels are low, but after about 6 weeks after your last period, it should show up on a test. Just go to your doc and get a blood test.|`|ikqxCzRUaa	Caffiene will not make your test come out any different.  If you are doing the test wrong...that is another story.|`|ee61e5c9182f80497740aeecc845e0edaa	Pregnancy tests don't work right away.  The most common early pregnancy symptoms include:    Darkening of your nipples  Discomfort and tenderness in your breasts  Nausea  Irritability.    Try to take another test in a few weeks.  If you just can't wait, a blood test will let you know right now.  Go see your doc.|`|ViZUiEgxaa	well i'm sorry to say, but if you are pregnant you shouldn't be drinking that much caffeine anyway, and if your doctor told you are pregnant and u know for sure that u are, yes u are still pregnant, and your levels of hcg might be to low to detect it.
4t5eGShiaa	I have Kaiser insurance and only paid $250 at the hospital (my deductible). All my prenatal visits with my Ob/Gyn were fully covered.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	we didnt have to pay anything with Kaiser.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	My C-section was $10,000 at the hospital where I delivered.  I'm assuming that most will be around the same.  All I had to say after receiving that bill is that I'm really glad I have good insurance.|`|7YZiy9iWaa	We paid a little over $800. It really just depends on what type of plan you have with Kaiser.
eO4y3m1maa	What are you doing not having any knowledge of sex but having the activity?    Cuming on her thighs will not get her pregnant, and bleeding from her butt? Maybe she's just not cleaning properly when shes bleeding..the blood can get messy. Those problems like nauseated feelings etc are normal things for periods and when people stress things they can convience themselves its true.    You guys should learn about sex stds and etc now after this scare..maybe go to a doctor have them explain things to you....|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I seriously doubt she is pregnant since she did have her period, but she really needs to go to the doctor and find out what is going on with her body. Even if it is stress because it seems to be affecting her so much maybe her doctor can give her something for it!!!|`|IA5zVfk0aa	ya shes not pregnant, tell her to go to the doctor, thats the only way she will know|`|ldcs7OdXaa	Just go get her a pregnancy test; then you will know. And if the butt bleeding continues tell her to go get a check up.|`|5aJ6E3JFaa	The symptoms sound more like some kind of gastrointestinal problem, not pregnancy, especially if the only time you think she MAY have become pregnant is last wk.  She should just go to the dr if she's worried about it, good luck!|`|EzbJsE5eaa	If you didn't have sex, odds are that she isn't pregnant. The odds of conceiving around the proper days are about 20-25% without any type of fertility treatment, and if this was the day before her period, she most likely was not ovulating. I'm guessing she's stressed, and this will often intercede the body's natural hormone processes. Have her relax and take a test. The test may help take the stress and worry from her mind about being pregnant.|`|wNZ95AK3aa	NO SHES NOT PREGNANT! she is prob getting herself worked up over nothing.but about her bleedin from her bottom it prob could be hemeroids an shud go get some cream for it.if it doesnt clear up go to doc|`|ygbDZPJHaa	lol it's gone be ok hun just take her to the doctor and if she is prego stick by her side         **sincerly  princess**
LpcqKrZtaa	Hi sweetie,    First of all, congratulations in taking the first step and contacting your birth mum.  It must have took a lot of thought and courage to do something like that.    Secondly, I wouldn't give up hope.  You sent the letter a few months ago...  Wait a bit longer.  She may be finding it very difficult to understand why you'd want to get in touch with her, and is trying to find the right words to reply to you.    I'd say that if you haven't heard anything by the end of this month, send another letter, and perhaps a bunch of flowers (if you can afford it)?    Never give up hope - I can't give advice from experience, but I can give it from the heart.  You are a very brave person to want to get in contact.  Give it time, and try again.    Good luck hunni.|`|tRUoj8cPaa	Yes I send many emails and sms to a friend and her husband in melbourne, which she never replied. I felt very bad and stopped texting  both of them. After two month I sent them another sms. She replied by texting she can't recall any detail of me. We started communicating again.    I will sugest write her again until she replies. try to find out if she hasn't change her address. Good luck.|`|12a37bf38f7fb21bfefcd10a348ca1beaa	Due to her present circumstances, she may want to keep that part of her life as only a very sad time. but, i would try again  and say that you will not write again if she does not want you to. SAD i know,for you both,and i do hope it turns out well for you .|`|nj8o4Rgzaa	im adopted too and my birth mom told me that if i ever tried to contact her again she would come and kill my dog. So give her another chance but keep ur dog far away|`|Ub8BP2Oeaa	Maybe, she's busy and hasn't gotten around to it yet. Wait. My birthmom died in December, and I'm 14. Trust me.|`|nkCvNUR5aa	I no how u feel my mom just up and left  to tennessee (we live in chicago heights illinois) me and my 2 sisters in the care of an auntie while she went to live with her new husband and my half brother i feel as if i am not gud enuff i try and try to contact her but i am just fed up i realized a while ago that u cant chase after someone if they already have their mind in a different place, im sorry for u but it will b ok i promise|`|V1dNF1vCaa	Maybe your bio Mum is just scared that she won't have a good enough answer for giving you up and the fact that she might just be that worried shows she might just care.     My partner is looking for his father because they have never met and we have two young children, but he's trying to finding him knowing that he might not get the answers that he wants. It's just something that's best known, rather than spending the rest of his life not knowing what happened or if he has other brothers or sisters.     Call your Mum. She might be shocked and not say anything at all when she hears your voice, but just tell her that you're calling because you're willing to hear her side of what happened with an open mind and that you want to at least try building a relationship.     Good luck. Hope this helps.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	It took my bdaughter about 6 weeks to get up the nerve to call me. Your firstmom is probably in shock. It took my friends bson 2 years.     Give her some time but don't give up. Write her again. She is probably terrified that you hate her for giving you up. She might not of told her family about you.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	Maybe she is away, has not received it yet, or maybe lost in the post or delayed due to the chaos happened from the snow in the last few days, give it time if not why not go there in person and talk to her.|`|UVblLg4naa	I'd give her another few months.  It must be pretty shocking to hear from you after so long.    This isn't exactly the same situations, but we got a letter from my half sister Jemmais about 4 or 5 months ago, who my Dad hadn't seen in years (since before I was born)  These things take time, my Dad took a while to adjust to the idea that he could have her in his life again, and he was also worried wat she wuld b like, since he hadnt seen her in so long.  But we met a few weeks ago, and we get on really well :D    If she doesnt reply, perhaps you should accept that maybe she doesn't want to get in touch, for whatever reason. Don't let this hold you back in life, you've still got a whole lifetime ahead of you :)|`|3X4i5Whvaa	When I sent my letter to my son( we were reunited when he was 21) he  was actually thousands of miles away from the address I was given by the searcher.    He was in the military.    It took quite awhile before my letter actually reached him, although the address where I sent it was an address for a relative, where he had lived in high school, and was still recorded on his military records.    Other people can sign, sometimes, for a registered letter.     If she did sign for it,your mother is probably thinking about how to reply, or she may be thinking about how to tell her family members. My son discussed my letter with his wife and other people. He thought about it a lot, even though he had actually been searching for me, too.    His wife was the person who eventually contacted me.    Is there anyone who could check out the situation for you? You could wait a little longer, and then try again.     you could ring her...or just try to send a note.    you could go there, if it isn't too far, perhaps. I know other people who have done this, and they were able to see things about their relatives' living situations, just by being in their neighborhoods.    I know this is awfully hard.    Wishing you the best, and hoping this works out for you.|`|VUfT35UQaa	becca, no matter what, you have nothing to lose, you already have a loving family, and showing up on her doorstep will be awkward, but I doubt she will be angry. Just introduce yourself, and ask if it would be okay to talk.    good luck|`|n8Db77zbaa	Maybe she didn't get it. Postal Services lose mail all the time. Why don't you just call her?|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Are you absolutely sure that she received the letter?  She may have moved or not received it because it didn't arrive.  I really feel for you and hope you do manage to make contact.  I never knew my natural father, who was a G.I. during WW2 and know how if affects people.
diEZW57caa	If you aren't pregnant then you need to make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.  If you have an infection then you need to get it taken care of, otherwise it could get much worse.|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	Your breast might got infection go to doctor!|`|frvbZ6auaa	You need to go to the dr and get checked out.

An infection in a tooth can spread to the jaw, which can seep into your chest. Go get checked out. Are you running a temp or anything?|`|paCHaDWVaa	I would go to a doc asap, a friend of mine had that happen and she wasn't pregnant and they found a lump in her breast. Not tryin to scare ya but go to the doc!|`|5UoLngxfaa	you might have an infection|`|fypgDK53aa	You could have mastitis, an infection of the milk ducts.     You could also have galactorrhea, which is the flow of milk separate from being pregnant. Being on homonal contraceptives (eg. the pill or Depo-provera) can cause this, as can some hormone disorders. It can also be caused by excessive stimulation of the breast.     Some of the disorders associated with galactorrhea affect fertility, or can indicate more severe disease, so it is best to be assessed by a physician in order to have a hormone panel done.
dcd11iUwaa	Some women will lose their mucous plug or part of their mucous plug weeks before they go into labor. Losing your mucous plug does not always mean labor will begin shortly. Keep in mind that even if a woman has begun to dilate, it may be weeks before she actually goes into labor. However, if you notice blood tinged mucous before your thirty-sixth week of pregnancy, notify your doctor right away. As your body prepares for labor your cervix will begin to dilate and thin. As your cervix opens up, your mucous plug may fall out. Losing your mucous plug is a good sign that labor is on its way. Though, it could be days or even weeks after you lose your mucous plug before labor actually starts. Many women do not lose their mucous plug at one time; instead, they lose it more gradually. They may notice an increase in vaginal secretions weeks before they go into labor.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	It all depends, I posted a question last night because mine started coming out. Pieces are still coming out so I'm not sure if it really has any impact on labor or not. For me it doesn't matter anyway because I'm scheduled for induction on Monday.|`|sEFmjAJkaa	YOU"LL KNOW SOON......  BUT CALL THE DR..... HE MAY WANT YOU TO COME IN.........AS  SERIOUS INFECTIONS CAN HAPPEN DURING THIS TIME.........    GOOD LUCK.|`|8WRnqs08aa	I've only lost my plug & gone into labor naturally, once; my first pregnancy. I noticed it on a Friday and gave birth the following Tuesday morning.|`|frvbZ6auaa	I just lost mine this morning, all at once I believe. I read up on it though, and the sites I looked at said that you can lose it all at once or you can lose it little by little for weeks. It's just how your body works. Just start paying attention to any cramping you may start feeling because these could be early labor signs. Best of luck, you are almost there just like me!!!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	it shouldn't be green... unless your baby has passed meconium (first poop) in the womb. I'd call your doctor. When my plug came out I was already contracting and it took about 36 hours before I was regular enough to be admitted... and my plug was clear/cream colored and gooey not green.|`|60ApQsGOaa	you're gonna pop tomorrow|`|90oDPtNzaa	You should seek medical attention now!|`|Ez1eFeZ2aa	It could be meconium substance...  Which means the baby may have had a bowel movement in utero.  You should call your doctor immediately.  The only colors your mucus plug should be is clear, or a little pink because of bloody show..  But not green.  Please call your doctor ASAP.    Congrats on your pregnancy and hope this helps.|`|ExS5BrCqaa	Yeah but could it be baby poop if her waters haven't broken? I first lost part of the mucus plug on 20th December...i was due 6th Feb...still waiting!!!!     Anyway, for the past 3 weeks I have been loosing loads of the stuff and still no baby! So annoying. My plug is clear though, you may have an infection? With my first baby, I lost the plug at 6.30pm, my waters broke at 10.30pm and he was born at 8.30am. Its different for everyone and every pregnancy I guess. Hope everything is ok     Sharon x
3xMQW0A6aa	sperm dies when it hits the air. however, if it is in a sperm friendly environment like the womans reproductive tract during the right time of the month, it can live for up to 3days.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Sperm is alive until it dries.  If it is still wet it can cause a pregnancy.
Wz9tSKTaaa	To the best of my knowledge (which isn't perfect) it is not accepted as scientific fact that this happens. I'm referring to a change of blood type due to pregnancy - it is accepted that a bone marrow transplant can change your blood type, but that's a different matter entirely, since it's doing the manufacturing.    It is possible for genes to get switched on or off, of course. I'm not sure whether that's plausible in this sort of case - for one's body to start manufacturing blood with different antigens due to anything less drastic than the above.    I'd want to rule out weak-D  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_bloo...  for the case discussed here, and think that some of the cases neet found might be explained by sub-types of A  http://www.owenfoundation.com/Health_Sci...  For example, the Navy guy with AB+ going to A+ blood. It's not impossible to have A type mistyped as AB, and A blood wouldn't be lethal to AB types (they would be the only people he would be donating to). That doesn't mean he's wrong, of course, but anecdotal evidence isn't enough.|`|eCbhygS8aa	I never heard of this but i found your question interesting since i'm also O- and have had the shot twice.I looked it up and found this.     http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_it_possible...

AA12145826	LMAO @ WWtW I find that closets are wonderful babysitters! LoL j/k    Yes people hire babysitters. You'd have to check with your area for the going rate. I used to charge $8/hour for the first child & $4/hour for each additional child. That was about 15 years ago, so adjust for inflation.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I haven't had to hire a babysitter yet because we have friends who are willing to do it for free.

YFPMcHCbaa	I'm really getting tired of seeing this type of question on here. None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|Z1FdawAOaa	the doctor does know the truth and if he says your not you probably aren't.

Maybe the hormone isn't in your urine yet.    good luck!|`|UaL28atDaa	It sounds possible and you do need to wait a little longer to get a positive test it usually takes about four weeks. Take a look at this video it explains what you will experience in the earliest stages of pregnancy.     Good luck    http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...|`|EzbJsE5eaa	If the doctor's test told you that you weren't pregnant, the safe bet is that you aren't. If, however, you aren't convinced, go back in a week and request a blood test. That is the earliest test they can do and it will be right. I've never had a doctor's test be wrong. Good luck!|`|PjEDYI3caa	sounds like you are pregnant , and my doc said you are suppose to wait 2 weeks to ake any test other wise most likly itll come out negative , not sure if thats true, but 4sho you sound pregnant|`|DrrycTYGaa	To be honest i think you might be. Thats how i was but it was too early to come up postive. after a couple of weeks when i took a pregnancy test it didn't even take a minute before it showed up positve. But dont stress yourself out especially if you might be. then again you also can miss a period it sometimes happens.
ggfE4rlvaa	After my daughter was born, I didn't get a period for a year. Then after that I still nursed for a loooong time, lol. Got pregnant while still nursing, but after about 2.5 years.|`|8WRnqs08aa	YES!! I am 8 weeks 6 days pregnant with  5. I am still breastfeeding my 7 month old and supplementing with formula. (I breastfed exclusively for the first 4.5 months)   I had my first period since delivery, on Dec. 5th. January 10th, I received my first positive HPT.    They say if you breastfeed exclusively, without giving solids or formula, then your chances of getting pregnant are slim to none. However, when you begin supplementing and introducing solids before 6 months of age, then your chances of pregnancy increase significantly.|`|WPI0Z47saa	It is actually easier to get pregnant while breastfeeding.

I didn't mean too, though! The fact I was still breast feeding was just a coincidence...I used a contraceptive which failed.

I was pretty confused...didn't know I was pregnant until later and  I was 4+ months along, and things weren't adding up. That sucked, let me tell you.|`|oL4IU5G3aa	Ha ha ha I always thought sexual intercourse was the best way,sorry couldn't help it|`|185431bf2d462938a17318fe8510b2c0aa	yes i know loads of people that have got pregnant whilst breast feeding,  its not 100%  effective  either get contraception or abstain from sex to prevent it!!!

I was 5 months pregnant and my whole family took turns painting my belly.  It was so cute!|`|XCueIYnYaa	Aww that's soo cute. I never thought about doing it for easter. Im not sure how much ill be showing then, but if im showing enough I will. My friend did it for Halloween last year when she was about 5 months along.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	lol I've seen this and I think it is cute, but it is definitely not for me. :)
pzLDXL6gaa	That guy sounds pretty stupid. I wouldn't be able to stay friends with a person like that. Yes, it's their son, but it's not their foreskin. It's their son's penis. Also, I wouldn't stay friends with an abusive parent even though it's their child and not my business, I see it similar to that.    Infant circumcision is cruel and unnecessary. But you'll find a lot of mothers here are from the USA and in the generation where it's common so they do it without a second thought and also buy into the myths about dirt etc. Luckily there are some people who know the truth.    Harriet|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Its a personal decision.  There is no right or wrong answer.  Do as you wish with your own child as others will with there's!    Why start a debate when you obviously have a biased opinion?|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I agree that it's cruel and unnecessary, and I did not circumcise my son.  But I wouldn't refuse to speak to someone over their decision to do so to their own child.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Grow the fck up! Its his kid not yours, and if you will end a friendship over that, then he didn't need you anyways. You actually ended a frienship to people you said yourself you were close to because of circumcision. Think about that, it is NOT normal.|`|5D0KuT74aa	its barbaric  and should be abuse  its like cutting off a babies fingernails  they're natural, sure, it may look "nicer" but its not supposed to look that way  and getting it done bcause his dad looks like that is stupid, when they actually look the same, they wont be looking at each other, and cutting it because women like it better is even stupider, if women can't appreciate a natural man, then they can **** themselves|`|K4zsztkRaa	I wouldn't talk to the father any more either.  he just robbed his son of the most important part of his penis and a very important part of the whole sexual exsperience for nothing. He doesn't know how much sensitivity he just cost his son.    I can't believe he said that.  If he said "It's more natural that way" I would have just stopped talking to him because he isn't of a high enough intelligence to talk to me lol    I think circumcision is aweful and takes away a childs human rights.    I don't agree with it at all.  Only when the man choses it for himself.  Never fo anyone else.    It doesn't border on barbaric, it crosses that line.    -Connor|`|4ksa4lhWaa	My son had it done and I left it up to my husband.  And my husband said YES he will have it done.     I agree with it but like everything its a personal choice.|`|RZKygoPzaa	If your going to do it, its best to have it done when you are an infant.  That however is obviously a parent's decison at that stage.    My father told me he had it done as an adult, in  spite of the fact that he said it was indeed very painful.  He had it done when he was in the army due to the fact he was getting a lot of infections and it had become very annoying to him to say the least.  He never regretted having it done.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My son is absolutely NOT circumcised.  They can circumcise a girl, but they don't - and why? Because it is genital mutilation!  I am very proud of the fact that my son is intact (as well as my husband).  There is no reason to have it done.  I am very strongly against circumcising boys, and am so glad to see that so many people are beginning to feel the same!|`|5JB1fHz9aa	I had my son circumcised as a newborn and I wouldn't change my mind about it.  My fathers ex-girlfriends son was not circumcised as a baby and when he was about 12 years old had to have it done because it kept getting infected.  Him and his mother were in so much pain (his mother because she had to keep changing the gaze and she seemed very tired from it all) and I told my self I wouldn't put my child through that.  I mean I did, but not nearly as bad as someone who is older who will remember the pain.  My son only had to be bandaged for a day and we just had to keep putting Vaseline on it every diaper change and he never seemed to be in any pain.  I'm sure if my husband wasn't circumcised I probably wouldn't have, but he is so why would I want my boy to look different from his father.  I am pregnant with my second boy and plan on doing the same thing with this one.  I mean I don't say that people who don't get their boys circumcised are weird or anything, they have their own beliefs as to what is right.  So there is no reason to judge another couple of their beliefs as to what they think is best for THEIR child.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	I don't think what they decide to do with their child's foreskin is any of your business and it's definitely nothing to lose a friendship over.  I should also probably mention that I would never circumcise my son, if I had one, and my husband isn't circumcised.|`|GahpE5U2aa	I would have been pissed off too. I don't get people who say "it's not your business." Well, it's not my business if my friend starts beating up his girlfriend either. But I will protest it because I think it's wrong. It's abuse. Just like circumcision.    I would never have my children circumcised. Either gender. I would divorce my husband before allowing it. NOTHING would make me allow mutilation of my children.    Luckily this is not such an issue for me living in Europe since very few men are circumcised here. And I hear Denmark is proposing to ban all circumcision of male children. This is great news and I hope Sweden follows!|`|4arnbpUCaa	I'm against it too. There is no good reason for routinely circumcising a baby boy.    Would I stop being friends with someone if they had it done to their son? Maybe, I don't know.|`|2jk2qSy5aa	I am with you- except I don't think it borders on barbaric, I think it is barbaric and cruel. My son is intact and there was never a question about it. the foreskin serves a very important purpose and it's disgusting that people have their babies strapped to boards to have functional tissue removed for no medical reason whatsoever. It violates the rights of the child and is extremely unethical on the part of the doctor performing the mutilation.    And as far as it being "none of your business what they do with thier child"...well, I'm sure most people here would make it their business if a child was being abused, so how about we cut the bs. It's not your penis, so it isn't your business to cut it up!|`|4iXL4C6paa	It's a personal choice, I dont consider it barbaric, both of my sons are circumcised.|`|AA11119076	It was really none of your business what they choose to do with their son and it was very rude to make an issue out of it.  And by the way, doctors say men who are circumcised are less likely to contract STD's so he's somewhat right about it preventing infection.|`|6Ak0kDtKaa	it seems so wrong to me. to put a baby through so much unneccessary pain. i dont get it. i think its so abusive and is completely unnatural. Just becuase something is done in the past does not mean it should be continued.     i would never do that to my son or my daughter (depending on culture). either way, i think they way they are made is perfect.|`|0FrpkZt7aa	IT's definitely for cosmetic not hygenic purposes anymore...remember that no American girl wants to date sharpei, and this procedure is extremely painful when done later in life....|`|GBHVkElWaa	I did it and regretted it because it is traumatizing for baby. I had always thought that it was best but after my father became upset after I told him. If I could turn back time I would not have done this. I signed a paper in the morning after my son was born stating I wanted a circumscion. An hour later it was done and I could hear my son screaming in either pain or fear across the hall during the procedure. I knew it was him crying, I already knew his cry. I was recovering and couldn't get up out of the bed to comfort him so I just cried and cried helpless to change my mind and stop it. His pain was agony for me and I will never forget it. It was a painful dilemma for nearly 2 weeks after the procedure because we needed to keep it gauzed and lubricated and it looked horrible and painful and it was heartbreaking and I felt so guilty. I should have left him the way nature intended him to be and now I cannot change it. It is barbaric and stupid.|`|AA12243380	My personal opinion is that circumcision isn't necessary.  Is it barbaric?  I think that's a bit of a jump but I think that it's something that I would prefer not be done.    That being said, I am 39 weeks and 3 days pregnant with my first and probably only son and my husband is very adamant that our son get circumcised.  At first I was willing to go to war with him over this issue but upon further review I came to the realization that this is HIS son.  Yes, I am his mother and he is my son too- but this is my husband's son and I am letting him make the choice.  He was circumcised and he obviously doesn't feel that it was barbaric and he wasn't traumatized so I'm not going to drive a wedge in my marriage over a philosophical argument.|`|Q7jMH5praa	Yes, my husband and I decided to circumcise OUR son. It's a personal decision. It is in no way barbaric or cruel to the baby. My son wasn't crying when he came back after having it done, nor did he cry when I changed his diapers. It's way better to have it done when boys are little then when they can actually remember the pain.    As for the little story you posted about your "friend". He's way better off without you. It's HIS son not yours, HIS decision not yours. For you to sever a friendship over something like that is stupidity at it's finest.|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	I agree it's barbaric and I resent my own circumcision more than I can say. Remember there has been 100 years of pro-circumcision propaganda in some western societies and your former friend is sucked in by it. He finds it hard to imagine what it would be like to have a foreskin and probably thinks it is "just skin".  Circumcision is the amputation of the foreskin, not extra skin but an integral part of the penis; measuring 15 square inches in an adult and accounting for over half the penile skin, lots of specialised nerve endings and the most sensitive parts of the penis.   Not one major medical organisation in the world recommends routine infant circumcision anymore. The US is the last western nation still doing this to about 50% of its newborn males but even there rates are falling and many insurance companies no longer cover it, because it is deemed a waste of money. Sadly they often still don't use anaesthetic either and when they do its risky and ineffective. It's child abuse, pure and simple.  The claimed benefits of circumcision are a beat up (based on flawed studies) and don't really exist but medical authorities have worked out that the overall complication rate is higher than all the benefits claimed by the pro-cutting advocates. One by one the claims are disproved but the pro-cutting zealots come up with more and keep quoting the old ones despite the evidence against them. For example you have more chance of dying from a circumcision or losing your penis from infection than from penile cancer. The rate of penile cancer is higher in the largely-circumcised USA than in European countries where less than 1% of the male population is circumcised. Plus circumcised men have been found to have penile cancer, mostly on the scar. (Remember this is a very rare disease in intact or circumcised men).  A very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.  Using surgery to mutilate the genitals instead of washing in a modern western society makes no sense. Normal intact male genitals are, if anything, easier to wash than female ones and the same substance, smegma collects in the genital folds of both sexes. A few intact males have problems with tight foreskin but this is only a tiny proportion of intact males. The condition can now be almost always treated with simple stretching exercises, sometimes in combination with a steroid cream that speeds up the process. However doctors who do not value the preservation of the foreskin often still trot out circumcision as a first-option treatment in the US and even some other countries.  I wish I'd been given the chance to choose for myself. Intact men can choose to get cut at any time in their life, though most have no desire to do so. The internet has shown that many men resent being circumcised. It's just not something that most of us talk about a lot, even to our parents.  Geoff|`|W3vuQtRMaa	I think it's barbaric.  And even if it was HIS son, that doesn't mean it was HIS decision as the parent.  That penis belonged to an innocent child who should have the right to make choices about unnecessary body modifications.  We did not have our son circumcised when he was born.  Being born is traumatic enough and I just couldn't see subjecting my precious baby to any unnecessary trauma.  I didn't even research it at the time; I just knew in my heart that it wasn't right.  I actually did start researching it in the 3 years after my child was born, and I'm now happier than ever that we didn't do this to him.    As far as ending the friendship, I'll agree it's hard to stay friendly with someone that you know has harmed a helpless infant.  But let me offer this: many circumcised men are in denial about what happened to them as infants.  As a woman who has never been a victim of genital mutilation, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to realize that you were harmed in the most violent way at the most vulnerable time in your life.  Rationalization may be all he has left.|`|WJR1bfEWaa	The most compelling reason not to circumcise is that    Infant Circumcision Harms Adult Sexuality  for Both the Man and his Female Partner    http://www.ask.com/web?q=circumcision+se...|`|kAHrcCL6aa	Disgusting and wrong. I don't stay friends with people who think that's acceptable.
wcv9xgh5aa	Well yes of course. She needs to stay clean. Just make sure that the water is warm, not too hot and not too chilly. She should be fine. Although if you aren't quite sure and if your scared to risk it then my best suggestion would be to call the doctor and ask. Hope she feels better[:  God Bless You.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Should be fine.  I would recommend waiting though.  If, you don't need to take her anywhere, just letting her go a couple days won't harm her either.  But, if you give her a bath make sure you get her warmed up right away.  The steam may help loosen up her chest making it easier for her to breath.  Have you tried a Vick's vaporizer in her room as she sleeps?  This can also help.  BTW- hoe old is she?  If an infant, double check with your pediatrician first.  Otherwise, should be ok.  Hope she fells better soon.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	Sure . Just make sure the bathroom is well heated and that her hair is dry before she is in a cooler room. You might even shower with her. Put on a swimsuit if you are uncomfortable.|`|AA10526033	nothing wrong with that.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	A warm bath will actually make her feel a little better, it will also help her breath a little easier as well.  I hope she feels better soon!
LHdJKahnaa	My daughter models for Wilhelmina. She is 4. She likes doing it!    Throwing up? NO way! My daughter has worked a short time in the biz and is already in 3 diff. magazines (well-known).    Wilhelmina and Ford are top in the country!! those are the 2 best ones to deal with.  www.wilhelmina.com www.fordmodels.com  There is always food catered in too for any shoots!!!!!!Absolutely no throwing up and binging--maybe OLDER models like Linsey Lohan----ugh.    Stay away from people and con artists like kidtalent or EXXCEL model and talent agency!  Anyone who wants MONEY UPFRONT IS A SCAM ARTIST!  Submit photos to top agencies like Wilhelmina, Ford or Product,Gilla Roos---*more children oriented)..these are out of NYC, LA,MIami----chicago--------- You have to live near a MAJOR city to do this!!  Alot of time invested too. It isn;t all glamour and glitz. You can get a call for a "go see" and it could take all of 1 minute!and you are off!    I suggest you wait until at least pre-school age to do any of this with your daughter.  SEND  SOME PICS *doesnt have to be professional either* to these agencies above- They will call you back if they are interested. We got calls from both agencies ;:Ford and Willy kids!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	barbizon is always good for their self-esteem|`|5f6XnInEaa	Let the child decide when they are older if they want to model or not.

There is no throwing up after meals are you kidding me??? My kids have modeled for 5 years now have worked with celebs shot commercials and done runway. My oldest is super confident and unbelievably well spoken. She excels in school because of that confidence and is not anywhere near arrogant. We've worked with A LOT of child models over the years and I dont know of a single child that took pills or threw up after eating that is ludicrous! They have put away money for their education and have been treated with respect all along. My daughter has so much fun on set. The kids are treated to all sorts of pizza and treats etc from craft services. Im sure that if they were so concerned about their weight that wouldn't happen. The kids are treated exceptionally well, and have a lot of fun.    If you want an honest answer as to whether your child will succeed etc  go to FORD models. Its the most respected agency in the world, no BS they only accept a few kids out of the many, many kids that apply but their kids work because everyone knows of their standards.    Good Luck.

VClxXNs3aa	How old is your baby and is he/she breastfed?  Anyways I dont think you should be worried, but if your baby is fairly young and breastfed, it is probably an imbalance of foremilk and hindmilk, meaning he.she is not getting enough of the fattier hindmilk.....  so try to keep baby on one side instead of switching halfway through feedings or going back and forth feed on one side for 2 feedings in a row....... I really cant answer any better without more information..... if your baby is older and on solids it is probably something they ate.|`|rVNdYGHmaa	if hes still a newborn it really isnt too much to worry about their poop can be all sorts if colors...|`|hktlWRoIaa	not at all. if your child has had anything to eat with a blue, green or even purple color to it, their poop could turn out green. my 18 month old has had alllll kinds of different colored poopies. and yes VIBRANT green too. try thinking back to what he/she has eaten today or yesterday. although, if your baby's poop is ever black, call your baby's physician.|`|71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	How old is your baby?    Is he/she breastfed?  More info is needed.      If your baby is just a day or two old, it is normal.  If they are a few weeks old and on breastmilk, you may have something going on, either a virus or a foremilk/hindmilk imbalance.|`|qZJIqZ5faa	consistency is usually more important than color since babies poop tends to be different depending on what they are eating... just wait till they eat carrots, peas, or gerber chicken noodle 2nd foods... comes out smelling the same (ick!).... its ok, its all due to a immature digestive system. as they get older and eat more things, the poo starts to become more normal looking.

I also found toujours (lidl's own brand) nappies to be very good - absorbent as well as cheaper than the big brands.|`|w5uHiNcoaa	Unfortunately, I don't really think there is a definitive answer to this - just as every baby is different, different brands will suit a baby better than others.    It is a bit of trial and error - I  tried a lot of different brands before I got the best ones. even then, this can change as baby grows!    My experience is this - I used Tesco own brand (the ones in the purple pack) and found them excellent. They fitted perfectly and it was a rare occasion I had to deal with leaks (only had leaks really when the next size up were needed). I had tried Pampers - found they were not that great and I wasn't impressed with the quality (I may have had a rotten pack, but it put me off!), Huggies were good but they were too tight along the groin area (despite them being the correct size).    However, as my son grew bigger, I found Huggies to be the best.     Maybe the nappy brands have free samples you can get - maybe look on thier websites for info. I also got a free sample of nappies in one of those packs you get - can't remember if it was the Bounty pack, or one from another source.

AA10465540	When he spits it out, he's had enough.  Splenda won't hurt him, but it can be habit forming.  Monitor the volume he takes in and consult with your pediatrician on how much fluid is too much.  Don't give in to tantrums or "sippy strikes".  This will only encourage such behavior.  A little screaming is good exercise for a toddler and won''t hurt him at all.  You can use earplugs if it gets to you.|`|bQk0vpfSaa	wow, thats alot of fluids. i couldnt imagine going through that many diapers

Its great hes drinking alot but thats way too much... all things are ok in moderation but when they become excessive is when its a problem. So far Splenda isnt found to be all that bad but its not natural... and you don't want to find down the line like 5 years from now it causes say brain tumors or something. Its time to limit him to something else, or try different things. Real fruit juice, chocolate skim milk, a few things else more natural. Give them in different looking sippy cups. Fun ones he picked out. If he doesnt drink then by all means give him some of the crystal light, but you need to be consistent and strong. Dont give in to his every wish. I have a 2 year old that is behaving poorly for  different reasons and am learning I am too leanant.    Well I am not a scientist but I KNOW excess splenda is not good. Just because a package and a person says it is, I doubt it. Its NOT natural. Its made from SUGAR but its molecules have been changed. That doesnt happen in nature. So go ahead and pump it in but remember the big sucrose scare in the 80's lab rats coming up with HUGE tumors? Its just not  a personal choice for me. You asked what to do, I gave some so you get mad?|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Splenda is worse for you than actual sugar is!  Plus, he must be one huge 22 month old! My 21 month old is 24 lbs and my 33 month old (boy) is 33.5 lbs and he is good sized, wearing size 4 - 5 clothes.  Plus, you say you are going through 15 diapers a day... potty train the kid! He is more than old enough.  My son was full trained by 21 months and my daughter by 19 months.  Just don't have any crystal light in the house and be firm about that.  If there is none in the house, he can't have any.  After a couple days he will get over it, just stick to it.  It is not good for him.    http://www.wnho.net/splenda_chlorocarbon...    Read that|`|G5vGTTqhaa	Talk to your doctor about it he could have a bladder leakage problem|`|DKqsFGymaa	I don't think you have to worry about water poisoning.  That takes an extreme amount of water.    Although the Crystal Light is low in sugar, what I would worry about is the sweet tooth he is developing.  If he gets used to drinking a sweet drink all day long, he's going to want everything to be sweet and not show any interest in vegetables and healthy entrees.    My personal advice would be to try and slowly ween him from the amount of Crystal Light he's intaking per day.    Good luck!|`|uxItOSkmaa	15 dipes a day at 22 months!!  Wow, that's a lot of work on you and a huge expense :(  I drink crystal light fruit punch & give my son a sip (every couple days out of 'artificial sweetener' fear, but that's not your question, so I won't touch on that) and he loves it.  I'm sure if we offered it in every sippy, he'd drink as much as your LO does because it's sweet like candy.      Just like your son doesn't get mad about drinking water at night because he's used to it, you'll have to get him used to drinking water during the day too.  Sure, he's going to fuss like mad for a week or so because it's a change to him, but if you stay consistent and help him through his tantrums, he'll get used to plain water and eventually forget about the fruit punch.  Let him 'sippy strike' but don't give in and he'll drink the water when he's thirsty enough.  Keep an eye out for dehydration signs just in case.  If all else fails, cut the amount of powder you make for a container of crystal light and try weaning him that way.    The other thing that came to my mind is that excessive fluid intake is a symptom of diabetes.  It couldn't hurt to get your son checked.  Good luck!
DKqsFGymaa	I've run an in-home daycare for 13 years.  The average adjustment time for a new child is two weeks.  I don't agree with the above comment of children never being happy in daycare.  The kids who come to my house love coming here and cry when their parents pick them up because they were not done playing yet. (After an eight or nine hour day!)    It sounds to me like you've found a good daycare.  She'll get used to it.|`|bh6QrzWraa	Hello! I am the head teacher for an infant and toddler centre. Starting a new daycare can be a really distressing time for some children. Most children in my care will settle down in the first 5 minutes of mum leaving and sometimes they have stopped crying before mum even gets in the car!! But, the second day is always the hardest! i call it the second day blues. They know that mum is leaving, and its sad. As long as you make sure you make goodbyes are quick and she sees you leave (learning that you do leave) and then the reunions when you pick her up exciting (so she knows you do come back and she remembers that) she will be fine within a few weeks. If not, maybe a bigger centre is not for her and she may need to go back into home care. If children in my care are still unsettled after 3 or 4 weeks i reccommend that the family look into homecare as it is better suited to some quieter children or children who need more 1 on 1 care|`|60a21d73367b6bc125257e3aedc3acc9aa	Kids will never be completely happy going to a daycare. They can't take a nap when they want to, they can't have a snack or drink when they want to , they can't climb on mommy's lap when they want to, they are in a classroom type environment for most of their day. Even longer then regular school. I worked in a day care and some kids would get there at 6iam and would be there until 6pm. It's a bummer. I wouldn't like it either.  I never sent my kids to a daycare. I worked mostly nights until they hit school age so they could stay with their grandmother and still have someone around that truly loves them and has them at their best interest.  Remember, daycare teachers are paid no more then $12 an hour. Most on the low scale of $8-10hr. How much do they really care.    Hate to put it to you that way, but I've worked in one when I was pregnant, and made my mind up pretty quickly after trying to work at 3 different daycares and realized they were all the same.|`|jL7XdxzBaa	hi  people call me i am over protective mother.children cry for lots of reasons.just follow your instinct.if you think they scare your child find another place or some times kids cry for 3 or 4 months.my child cried 1st month and stopped and again 4th month he started crying ,because another child was hurting him.(he was in the kindergarten not the day care)wait a Little while and see.ayva will be all right.some times they don't like changes,so they cry.
PQw92IGHaa	Your doctor will typically recommend that you see a specialist.  You need to ask him to refer you to one in your area.  It is a fairly expensive procedure running anywhere from $10,000.00 to $20,000.00 a treatment and most places want the money up front, so you two will probably want to start putting back for it.|`|ddCU9KTWaa	After 3 yrs of marriage and trying to conceive all of that time. My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IVF. Went through the IVF injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IVF and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is. God bless you and know that He is with you through all of this.    http://www.indianmedguru.com  You can get much information in this website.|`|gdnL63ngaa	Why don't you try IUI first? Almost every clinic trys that first because it is a lot less costly, unless there is a major sperm problem!    IUI is basically Artificial Insemination. They actually take the "good" sperm and place it into your uterus when the timnig is right.    Although it didn't work for me, it may work for you and be a lot cheaper than IVF.    IVF cost including meds in Canada cost us about $8,000
AA11101968	Didn't the doctor explain it to you?  If not, you should get your money back.
H74F8jxuaa	You are more likely to get pregnant when you are ovulating, which is usually 14 days, give or take, before the start of your next period.  No, him ejaculating 3 times doesn't make your chances any better because sperm is already there.  I would take a test when you expect your next period.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, since you had sex the day before your period I'd have to say no.  You would have needed to have had sex ATLEAST 6 days before your period to have any chance dear.    Try having sex about mid cycle. =)
Hu9yquP4aa	yes, until your hormone levels return to normal. 4-6 weeks.|`|CUYuAGF5aa	Yes it is normal because of the hormones in your body changing.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Yes, you have to wait till your hormone levels get back to normal.  How long it lasts depends on how far along you were and what your levels are at the time it happened.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Yes. Your hormones don't just disappear after the miscarriage. Just like after the delivery of a baby, it takes a while for your hormone levels to go back to a 'normal' level. It could take several weeks to a couple of months, depending on what the hormone levels were before the miscarriage and just far along you were.|`|w6F89TuDaa	Yes.  My older sister had an ultrasound at 11 weeks.  She was still having bad morning sickness and the ultrasound showed the baby had stopped growing during the 8th week.  That is why symptoms really don't mean anything.  If you don't have morning sickness, or if it comes and goes, it doesn't really mean anything.|`|XCueIYnYaa	They could be like ghost symptoms, like when someone looses an arm or leg and they feel like its still there.
e4d883fe334f1756020738e456b9939eaa	hi just be carefull iv gone through similar i started bleeding a couple of days early and passed clots had sore back and cramps they said it was a miscarriage only to find out yesterday it was an ectopic pregnancy. please be carefull and make sure you keep a close eye on things good luck to you x|`|HmyRAJIJaa	Hi    Yes it is possible - you nearly get pregnant every month if having sex without contreception 70 - 80 % of these end in miscarriage if you can call it that but usually you tell by a heavier period.    Hope this helps
28fNd725aa	I would say yes this is prolly the beginning, but don't get your self to work'd up it could still be hours!!! Congrats !!|`|v3LnJycKaa	sounds like you are in prodormal labor  ( think that is how you spell it? or say it .. who knows) basically it is beinging of labor... best of luck and congrats.|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	It does sound like labor, but the tricky part with labor is that if these contractions don't last and go away within an hour or two then they are just helping you to dilate and be in 'early labor' which can last a while. After you don't have the plug and see bloody show you are expected to go in labor within 2 weeks usually.    Try alot of walking so the baby's head will engage and help you to dilate more.    Good luck.|`|gBDNbzJ2aa	bloody show happens Right before the baby comes.. so lol that wasnt what it was. as far as the contractions, unless your crying.. cant sit still.. screaming lol its not a real contraction..im just saying, im JEALOUS! i wanna have my baby! lmao     you could really be going into labor :) you should just go in now :) dont wait for them!!     37 weeks with a baby GIRL!|`|E1ppYqCtaa	GET TO THE HOSPITAL ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Could be early signs.  Contractions will back your belly hard as a rock so definitely time them as irregular contractions can go on for days and you don't want to go to the hospital too early just to be sent home.

I got my first ultrasound (vaginal) yesterday.  I was amazed at what they could see so early!  I'm thinking I must have gotten abducted and raped by aliens, cuz that's what my baby looks like.  (just kidding).  I had a miscarriage in July, so I was very very worried, but hearing them say everything looks good took a huge weight off my shoulders.  We'd been trying for almost two years.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	im 38 weeks, exhausted and anxious to meet this little girl. congrats and best wishes :)|`|TK0HKu0Iaa	I'm 21 and a half weeks.

I'm really showing now and I'm gaining alot of weight that I didn't think I'd be able can't fit alot of my old regular clothes anymore (aside from long flowing shirts). Feeling relieved by all the negative test results I got back this week for different screenings I had done and to hear everything is progressing fine by the doc.     I'm glad I'm passed the sickness stage but some smells and odors still bother me to my surprise and discomfort : ( I'm also more sensitive to the things that my family members and my fiance say to me.

We are remodelling our upstairs and still don't have the carpet in yet... So my baby's room is our front room for the next two weeks.

My belly has really started to blossom and I love it. I truly enjoy being pregnant. Best Wishes on a happy and healthy pregnancy.|`|8qw0Cdqiaa	Congratulations to you!  You definitely need to savour this time being pregnant (as hard as that may be sometimes) since it only lasts for a relatively short time.      I'm coming up on 25 weeks and although I don't look all that pregnant, I definitely FEEL pregnant.  Yesterday I took my daughter in for her 5 year old immunizations at the health clinic and had to call my husband over from work as backup.  I was a blubbering mess!  Couldn't get over the fact that my little girl (first born) was now 5 and growing up.  Talk about an emotional rollercoaster ride!  Gotta love those hormones!!!    Found out at the ultrasound that we're having another little boy.  We're so pleased as my son who is 3 will have a playmate to (eventually) rough and tumble with.  Our family will be complete once Thomas arrives in May and we are soooo looking forward to meeting him.    Have fun waiting for baby.  Remember to relax cuz the real fun comes when baby is here.  Good luck.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I am 14 weeks tomorrow. I already felt my first flutters,but it's my second pregnancy,so you feel them earlier with that.

Good luck!!|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Gotta love the mood swings :)    I cried the other day because I wanted some grapes.. yea.. so I'm right there with ya!    I am 10.5 weeks and had a subchorionic hemorrhage :( I had a ton of bleeding and I really thought I lost the baby. Very scary.. But the baby was actually ok (which I could not believe after all the bleeding and cramping). I am on bedrest and hormone supplements and just waiting to go back to the doctor on tuesday..    Hopefully its completely healed by then, not being able to pick up my son has been really hard :(..      Anyway...    Good for you for letting everything go to just relax! Everyone needs that sometimes. Everything that needs done will still need to be done tomorrow.. or even the day after :)|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	congrats!  i am 40+  weeks and at the point i just want him out!! I remember all of the excitement, waiting to find out the sex and the first movement... I am happy to say that I should be induced on Sunday if no baby by then :)
Pf9fyEyQaa	I had one done at 25 weeks and 31 weeks.  I loved it, it was awesome!  The one at 25 weeks was actually my favourite though because you couldn't see him very well anymore at the 31 week one (he was all cramped up!)  Here are some pictures of mine:    25 weeks:  http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn130...  http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn130...  http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn130...    31 weeks:  http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn130...  http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn130...    *Edit: My package came with the 2 ultrasound sessions, both on DVD set to music, a CD of the pictures, 2 pictures at each session printed out, listening to the heartbeat, sex determination, and guaranteed 30 minutes of viewing the baby's activities.    *Edit  2: You upload them onto photobucket or a similar sight and then copy the "Direct Link" and past that onto yahoo.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Yes it is pretty cool and weird at the same time.

BKr3y30maa	Well the fact that you are having a girl (congrats by the way), has nothing to do with why you have no sex drive.  I was the same way when I was pregnant.  Of course in my situation, I had nausea the whole 9 months.  It's just your hormones being out of whack.  Hang in there.|`|tNoXdgnKaa	It's probably all a mind game. Just don't try too hard and let it happen. But if it still isn't working, you should try foods high in zinc, vitamin e, etc. They are supposed to enhance your sexual libido.|`|UUtTDAJraa	Well it's normal to not have a sex drive while pregnant. It really is different with everyone. Who knows if after you will regain it back. It could be months, even years. I was in your situation with a no sex drive and it's not pleasant. I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't do anything. Until I tried this natural herbal enhancer which is meant to increase the sex drive along with other things I've noticed. It's a topical oil called Hersolution Gel which is like an instant libido boost. Along with that my sensations are just blasting and my orgasms are then best. Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time. It got better with every application. I was skeptical at first but the companies return policy made me commit. From what I remember you have to try out for a couple months but then after that you can return it if it doesn't work. It would work great for your situation considering your pregnant and theres no need to swallow anything. Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	sex drive during pregnancy is different from one women to the other.  i feel you honey ! my sex drive was ok during my second trimester,but it wasn't nothing close to my pre pregnancy sex drive ! now i'm 34 weeks & 6 days & haven't had sex in 2 months.i just don't feel comfortable any more !   but i have heard it gets normal after the baby is out ! i'm hopping !   lol !   congrats on you're little princess & good luck.|`|QXSFpMzDaa	I was the same way.  I was extremely nauseous my 1st and 3rd trimester and had absolutely no sex drive to the chagrin of my husband.  And as soon as I had the baby and I wasn't able to have sex for 6 weeks that was all I wanted!  Not having a sex drive is more normal than you think.  Your hormones are out of control who knows how you will feel in another 2 weeks!  Just keep trying and playing.  It will get better. I promise.
397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	you mean too late to start daycare? no. my stepdaughter didnt start going until she was 3-ish.|`|FplTPoAyaa	Certainly not.  Many daycares will take children up to school-age.  I taught a class of three year-olds.  It may take a bit for your child to adjust if he/she has never been in a social situation with other children, but it is my experience that most three year olds are pretty adadptable and enjoy being around other children their age.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	My kid went to daycare through 5th grade.  She still goes to a summer program and she will be 12 next month!|`|rYQCtRGgaa	No it is never too late for daycare. Because when she is 4 she can go into pre-k. And at 5 yrs is kindergarten. So it is all kind of the same. Plus most day-cares try to get get them ready for that and it can be really good and helpful depending on what daycare you choose. But be sure with the daycare you choose. They are not all good. GOOD LUCK!!|`|KmC0K59taa	No.  My daughter is nearly 2 and she's gone to daycare since 8 weeks of age.  I see lots of kids entering daycare for the first time at 3.  It is much harder for the child.  They will adjust after time though.  It's a really big thing for them to go someplace with strangers and have mommy leave them.    There is a 3 yr old boy at my daughter's daycare.  The first month he began crying the minute they walked in the door and pleading, "Mommy don't leave me."  He's been there over a month now and he doesn't cry anymore.  I always felt so bad for that mom!|`|ekAH05qWaa	i think you should your child to preschool rather than datcare because at daycare they would be around little babies and younger people. your cchild would probably enjoy being with kids their own age!
PkXJRfaBaa	Hi    Firstly, congratulations on your pregnancy.  Secondly, you may need to do a Genes cross for your child..    So, if your husband inherited Cerebral Palsy, did he inherit it from one or both of his parents? Only one maybe easier to understand.    Your husband has inherited one Dominant Gene (C) for Cerebral Palsy and one recessive Gene (c) which is not faulty from his parent's chromosomes. You don't have Cerebral Palsy, so you have (cc) alignment.     So your child has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease. It may become a carrier, not a sufferer, due to their father's faulty gene.    Hope I helped and explained clearly.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Cerebral Palsy is a brain disfunction condition usually the result of trauma during birth/labor.  It is not a inherited disease and therefore, your baby cannot received this disease through your husband's genes.  Good Luck to you and your husband and the little one.|`|AA11210211	It depends on how he is crippled,If it is genetic then yes there is a possibility.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It depends on if he'd disabled due to a hereditary disease or due to an injury.  Obviously the 1st one could be inherited by your child, but the 2nd one cannot.|`|9TfKeq9Eaa	Well that would all depend on what your husband has. If it is a genetic disease then your baby could possibly be effected one day. This definitely should have been discussed with your OBGYN. They normally ask about any disabilities or genetic diseases in all of your family history. If he has been disabled because of an accident or something non genetic then no your baby would not be effected by this.|`|iwYu32N2aa	Im sorry but I think that you are a liar. You posted a question 7 months ago saying that you were married. Now you say that you are married only 4 months? Which on is it?    yea nice try|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Was your husband crippled from birth or from an accident of some sort???|`|XyRzSzjtaa	im sorry but you love him yes???? that word cripple is a vile word carnt you word it better then that for gods sake.     GET A LIFE, LOOKS LIKE YOU RESENT HIM. YES IVE LOOKED INTO UR PROFILE QUESTIONS IF WAS HIM ID STAY WELL AWAY|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Depends on how your husband was disabled.  Some things are genetic but if it was just an accident then no.|`|NnPizqKNaa	if he was deformed at birth yes mayb but if it was an accident later in his life then no|`|AA11294818	It depends how your husband acquired the disability. If it was an accident, then no. If it is genetic.. then there is a possibility. But you know what? Even if your child ended up disabled, they'll still be your own wonderful lovable child, just like your husband is disabled but he is still your lovable wonderful husband.  I think you two can be so happy with your child with the right mind set :) Do don't worry too much!  God bless!|`|79eRDIbXaa	Well it depends on the disability and if your husband was born with his disability or not?  If he wasn't born with it then no and even if he was born with it, it doesn't necessary mean your child will have it.|`|f4WVWNxuaa	I'm sorry I can't believe that you just referred to your own husband as a cripple! That's such a horrible word to use.    In answer to your question though, your child will only have a chance of inheriting a disability if your husband has a heriditary illness of some sort and wasnt injured in an accident etc|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's cerebral palsy, god you honestly need to start spelling correctly, you've spelt about 50 words wrongly.     If you want to know more about this then ask your doctor, or look into it on the internet.|`|qJaKF24naa	good chance the baby will be born fine... If that disease is genetic.. later on it may develop it also but also good chance it wont. I would ask the doc they should know the statistics a little better. But i wouldnt worry it is like when you are deaf you have children who can hear... So it depends on how the baby develops! I think just because he has issues with his muscles, it might be geneitic but other than that the baby will be healthy. But also possible that it wont be passed.   Congrats! :)
BKr3y30maa	They do say that it's healthier.  But my son was on it because he had acid reflux.|`|6631c5068e2c4c313b1caa78900e6761aa	the benefits of soy is the same and regular milk...soy is recommended for kids who have sensitive stomachs or those who are lactose intolerant. my son was given soy as a baby, he is 8 years old now healthy and fine.
5DJcir9saa	You just made me laugh outloud at work!  Head back to the 1980's....there were lots of sucker m.c's around then  =)|`|sfUUml0Daa	lmao. this question made my day thanks. :D
w0eRRsoVaa	I would look into Prilosec or Prevacid (I think they make Prevacid for babes).  Two of my nephews had to be on Prilosec because of their reflux.  We found out after numerous trial and error runs that my godson had a narrowing of his esophagus that was causing him to spit up and be miserable because he was still hungry after numerous types of formulas and medication.  Talk to your physician to see if there is somethingelse to try him on.|`|Kg5KX432aa	hmmm... my baby has reflux as well. He was so severe that we had to put him on medicine. My doctor recommended Priolsec. It works wonders and has no ill side effects. Maybe ask your doctor about switching. I wouldn't want to give my child something that made them sick|`|4NNlQAuhaa	Should Take the baby to see your doctor or get on to a your local baby clinic. It's no use asking for advice unless it is from a professional  Gemma|`|hTQg5tgPaa	I don't know anything about it.  But I do know when anyone especially a newborn starts to show a reaction to any medication, should be checked out right away.  He could have developed an allergy towards it.  I would talk to a doctor prior to giving him anymore.  (from someone who had a serious allergic reaction when she was a baby to a medication).  Drs. advice to me is that if the baby is under 3 months and you have any concerns medically, should see a doctor right away.
e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	I think that would look good, especially since there's lavender in the quilt.  You may want to consider light green too.  Light green goes really well with pink.|`|uHcGn3Yaaa	I think it would look really lovely with it.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Don't ever try to guess at coordination from an online pic. Order the set (after checking return policies). If you like it when you get it, take it with you to the paint store to help you pick colors.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	lavender makes me sick, stick to nutrel|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Yes, that would look really good together.|`|giKCTfnfaa	yes, it would look very cute together.|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    well will like to say this that lavender is one of my favorite color and i 'm also thinking to get my room colored with it before my baby comes i think its a good choice & your baby girl will love it...  i think pink is also a good color especially for girls so if you are going to do a mix & match style then it can help you to bring up really a nice background type of feel..    as you are having a design on the bedding sheets or so you can get the same or some what that kind of design on the wall with mixing purple & pink..!!    hope i have helped..!!|`|OuaZBkU9aa	I think it would look cute!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I think a darker lavender would be a great color since the bedding is so light|`|5DAIonR2aa	absolutely gorgeous!|`|uQjKJq5Aaa	I think lilac would look fantastic. If you decide to go with a darker lilac...i would just go a touch darker (not too dark).

SEzIkGNiaa	Make sure your sisters daughters do not share hats.  She may be getting lice from other kids.    "Simply put, you can do everything right and your family could still end up with lice. And of course, head lice have nothing to do with hygiene or income level; anyone can get them. The most common route of transmission is head to head contact, such as two kids bending over the same coloring book. Because lice can't live long off the scalp, it's much harder, but not impossible, for lice to be spread by sharing hats, brushes, hair accessories and combs. Still, it's a good idea not to share these items."|`|AA11327039	I don't know how well this works but something worth trying is to get Tea Tree Oil Shampoo and Conditioner.  Maybe even use just a tiny amount of the tea tree oil conditioner as a leave in conditioner for extra protection.    It is said that tea tree oil repels the lice.  Apparently they don't like the smell of the stuff so they won't stay.    Weather or not it works, re post after a few weeks/months to let us know  if it works or not|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	lice actually prefers clean hair to dirty hair. so i dont understand why its so dirty. look it up.     what do you mean they are picking on her? sue them i guess|`|JK2RvliYaa	Yes sue them that must be the answer. just washing  the sheets may not work I had to put mine sealed in plastic for 2 weeks..|`|NTln9ULUaa	Sorry that your sister and family have to deal with this issue constantly. My youngest daughter is currently home from school with her second bout with Lice in the last 3 months.     First and foremost, it is not a hygienic issue. It is a well known fact that lice prefer clean hair as opposed to dirty hair. The oils in dirty hair do not allow for the nit (egg) to adhere to the hair shaft.    It is obvious that your sister is doing everything in her ability to rid her children of the lice, the fact of the matter is some other children within the school have the lice as well and their familes may not be aware of it or even perhaps know about it but believe that just shampooing the children's hair will rid them of the lice.    Your sister should talk to the administration office /principal in order to contact the public health nurse to check the children within each classroom. The nurse will be able to screen the children and then the parents are notified.    I am currently using a product called "RESULTZ". It is the ONLY shampoo on the market that is colourless and odorless and has no chemical residue. They break down the nit (eggs) so that they are unable to hatch and produce Louse. A Louse can lay 4-10 eggsa day and their adult stage lasts about 28 days. (day 23-day 50) So if even one adult louse is missed in the hair, there can be reinfestation for at least 2 months.    Any stuffed animals or stuff that can't be washed should be sealed in a bag and placed into cold. (depending on your location, you could place it on a balcony or in a garage as well)    However, like I said your sister seems to be doing everything under the sun to rid her home and children of it, so there is obviously another child with the lice.    I'm just curious why one member wrote sue them? Is that really an answer to everything? The school is just doing their responsibility advising the class. It really doesn't have anything to do with picking on your sister. But they should be proactive and have a lice screener come into the school.    There are also many people that you can hire in different areas to help rid people of lice.|`|bh6QrzWraa	Put a few drops of tea-tree oil in their shampoo. The head lice don't like the smell of it! It works!!|`|rYQCtRGgaa	Be very careful with not letting her share hair ties, hats, combs, or brushes. Anything of that sort. Lice is really easy to get rid of. I had it once. Go to the grocery store buy an aloe plant. Cut open the plant from all around the sides. Open it, it'll look really gooey put it in her hair as if your washing it leave it in for about 15-30 min then wash it out and brush and comb her hair. I would buy new hair ties, hats, combs, brushes. Also change her pillow case and bed sheets with new or clean ones. Try trust me it'll work I would know. GOOD LUCK!!
chmuDZObaa	Try to connect with some others who have been there.  I ran across this website the other day and it might help you.   It's all teens who are/were pregnant and how they told their parents.  I would say straightforward and honest is the way to go but I don't know your folks...  Good luck.        http://forum.baby-gaga.com/about92777.ht...|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Well, just write them a letter. Or have the baby's father tell them.. Good luck, I feel really bad for u because your life is basically ruined, ur only 15 and your going to be a mother.. No more going out with your friends, no more sleepin in until 2pm. The only thing your gonna be doing is changing poopy diapers, making bottles, cleaning throw-up off your shirt, and entertaining a newborn. And when they get to be toddlers and start walking, it will be even worst. You have to watch them every moment of every day.

If your parents are strict well your just going to have to tell them maybe tell a friends parent get them to be with you its always easier talking with some one rather than alone not  a friend because they wont understand as much as a adult good luck i feel sorry for you|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Here are some ideas to think about, but since I don't personally know your parents I have no clue how they will react.    -Which parent is the softer one? Alot of times daughters thell their mother's first and then the mother finds a way to break it to dad.    -Tell them in front of a trusted adult that already knows (favorite aunt, trusted family friend, guidance counselor, etc) then they are not as likely to flip out on you.    -Tell them in public, quietly of course, and then they will have to censor their reaction. Spend the remainder of the day elsewhere, giving them time to get used to it/absorb it, and then go home and talk about it.    -Make a doctor's appointment and have the doctor tell them.    Thats all the ideas I have.    Here's what I would do:    Tell an aunt or close family friend and make arrangements to stay with them for at least one night after you tell your parents. Tell your parents with this trusted person present and depending on how it goes, go stay the night with them to give your parents a chance to cool down. Have the trusted friend take you home and go in with you and talk about it in depth with your parents.    Good Luck!|`|uIg6an6Jaa	go watch juno...|`|nCBdJkbEaa	Honey, you have been drowned in information about safe sex and using condoms.

You would be surprised at how supportive they will be!|`|Yf9VZunaaa	God people on here can get so judgemental.  So you made a mistake, do you know if you are keeping the baby? Have you figured out any sort of game plan yet?  I know that at 15 it is hard and your parents are going to have lots of questions, so it might be best to see if you can have a plan in place before you tell them.  They are apt to be pretty upset since they are most likely the ones that will be financially supporting you and your baby.      If you have your baby's father on your side you could present a united front and that might help, but I doubt it.  The best thing to do it just come out with it.  Don't wait too long, your going to need every minute of the nine and a half or so months your pregnant to plan for this new arrival.      Just tell them, tell you mom first if she is least likely to flip.  Just know they WILL be upset but they WILL eventually move on. You're just going to have to grow up, you made a decision that you now have to deal with.  I'm sorry you have to grow up so early.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Just tell them...there is no way to sugar coat it.|`|ilnl2GpIaa	hunny, im going through the same thing.  i am 15. going to be sixteen & just found out im pregnant.  i told my mom by asking her what she would do if i was pregnant at this age.  & we talked about it, i cryed.  and she automatically knew.  it was so hard but i knew i had to do it.    honesty is the best thing, in this situation.  i wish you the best! i really do.  |`|E83WwEilaa	I was 17 when i found out i was pregnant!

There are people out there that cant have children and want them. Your parents are going to find out anyway,you think after a few months they are not going to notice? What are your parents going to do yell and screem? Who cares you have a baby on the way just tell them, things will happen for them sells. I had a 16 year old niece who went through the same thing now shes  21 and is married an has three kids! Why I dont know but its her life! Just remember your not in this by yourself, you family will just have to understand! Dont forget the other half that got you pregnant,get his parents envolved to!
M1MZy2GEaa	Do a paternity test when the baby is born. You both sound really young, so if her menstruation probably wasn't defined when you started having sex which means she could have ovulated anytime.    If you're having sex with her, it means you're comfortable enough to do so, why are you having doubts about her fidelity?    See, kids, this is a fine example of why CHILDREN should wait before having intercourse, I don't care far into your teens you are.    Until you can get a paternity blood test to confirm whether or not the baby is yours, you need to grow up fast and man up to the responsibility. Sex isn't just about pleasure, it's about consequences and responsibility. Good luck to both of you, and blessings to that baby who did not ask to be born into this situation.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	DNA test.  The baby is probably yours, but what can it hurt to get a test done when the baby is born?  Women do not get a period when they are pregnant.  When you get pregnant you won't get a period two weeks later- this time is usually when the girl finds out she is pregnant due to a missed period.  Anyway- that is not to say that the woman can't experience vaginal bleeding that is easily mistaken for a period.        http://blogs.webmd.com/healthy-pregnancy...  http://www.justmommies.com/articles/peri...|`|jar8EIelaa	And this is a woman you'd choose to have a child with???|`|V2r0HRKjaa	She could be pregnant and still have her cycle some people have a cycle the majority time of their pregnancy my mom and teacher did.  But you can't be sure so when the baby is born take a DNA test!|`|dxlNwGuWaa	Ask her!  Ultimately, it depends when she ovulated.  If she keeps the baby, she will get a dating scan, which will confirm how far along she is.  Judging by the date she is given, you will be able to count back to the day she fell pregnant.  However remember, the date is calculated from the first day of her last period so if you take away 14 days, you should get the conception date.  If she had sex with more than one man around the time of ovulation, the only way to find out will be a DNA test when the baby arrives.    But looking at your question, she probably wasnt pregnant before the 2 Nov as she had her period.      Good luck!|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	you could pay thousands for a paternity test before the baby's born.  or you could wait until the baby is born.  My first guess is that it is yours.  Especially if she no longer has her period now that she's pregnant.  Some women get it while their pregnant, but if she has stopped then she most likely did not get pregnant Oct. 14th.    Good luck with this one.|`|g7FsVQhUaa	If there has been more than one sexual partner, the only way to be certain is by a DNA test.

MB8WRQx9aa	In my experience, they were quite sore and fuller in the beginning, that was actually what made me realize that I was pregnant, but it did subside and they felt more normal again.  Towards the end of the pregnancy, the breasts again grow heavier and sometimes sore as the milk comes in.    During pregnancy, your body may experience some amazing changes, and although it's wonderful, not all of the changes are enjoyable.    Try to remain calm and relaxed ib your new changing body and just marvel at the beauty of how we were made.    Good luck!|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	oh yes...there will be a glorious month or two when they aren't sore-enjoy that while it lasts-otherwsie the boobies hurt the whole time and just grow. good luck!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I thought mine were getting huge around that time too, but since then I've had nothing and I still fit into my bra.

It's fun to have bigger boobs but MAN it hurts, hey?  Anyhow, I think this is normal, the doc saw them two days ago and said they are normal. I hear the soreness will subside a little but apparently they may get bigger. So hopefully you have some room in your shirt ;)  Oh well. God bless!|`|qJaKF24naa	everyone says they get bigger..

WXIoUwIBaa	That is a wonderful idea for a baby shower and you could have a lot of fun with the wording.  I would recommend something like:    "Down colorful pathways, over Rainbow Trails, past Peppermint Forests and Gumdrop Pass, you are invited to celebrate the sweetest of adventures.  Kristi and Danny would be honored to meet you at Candy Castle to celebrate the soon to be arrival of Mady."    or    "Please join Kristi and Danny at the start of their sweetest adventure; the shower for their own little gumdrop, Mady."    All the best,    www.baby-shower.com|`|VS8mactUaa	" Come see the sweetest one around" I think that would be cute for the candy land idea|`|fba450c791c2e5aa34640f936bd5aad7aa	LMAO...CANT WRITE WHAT COMES TO MIND,SORRY..CANDY IS DANDY BUT MADY IS SWEETER?|`|xx8M1RNuaa	try http://www.invitations-and-more.com. you will find a wording suggestion page where you can get ideas from.
T8ksKCWCaa	Your chances are lower than average, but still above zero. You may still be able to conceive, with or without medical intervention.|`|b97ab27d62fac407e8f40fe52edd9ae1aa	I had PID when I was 15. I too did not know until I had severe cramps and went to the ER. I tried in the past to get preg with no luck. WIth my current DH I went off the pill and got pregnant the very next month! I ended up MC but I was able to conceive. You can always ask your Dr for a HSG . It is a test that is performed where dye is injected to see if you have blockage in your tubes.    Good luck!
AA12334360	I like the way lindy suggests you lie about your intentions until you get your own way.    If you are thinking about that for a second then i wouldn't bother, its hardly a "christian" think to do|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Getting a child christened is the first step to raising it in that religion. Why would they welcome a child into a church you don't attend, are you planning on starting to attend regular service? Will the god parents regularly take the child to church? That is the purpose of getting christened in a church. Anyone could baptize, if you are just wanting it done for beliefs.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	i agree with coolbabe.     if you dont go to church, whats the point in getting your child christened? most churches wont do it if you dont go to that church.|`|780ByZVEaa	you would have to promise that you are going to church. Just go until you get him/her baptised thats what my brother in law did|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I was christened and my parents didn't go to church but that was in 1945, things may have changed.   I don't really understand why parents who didn't go to church would want to.  I didn't have my children christened.  My son is an atheist and my daughter had herself christened and confirmed.  I believe in freedom of choice.|`|2z1h5mfOaa	It will depend on the church where you would want the child baptised.  At the same time, if you don't go to church yourself, is there a reason why you want to have your child baptised?  If it is to please others but you're not religious yourself, then why?  I was brought up as a catholic but came away from that when I was in my late teens.  My husband was a non-believer, and therefore we didn't have a church wedding and didn't get our children baptised.  At the same time we wanted to ensure that, should anything happen to us, someone would be looking after the children, so we chose "godparents", who promised that they would be there for our children if need be.|`|AA11607818	Well if you want your child christened just for the sake of it, and for show, why should the vicar?  Christening's are all about welcoming the child to God, not for an excuse for dressing up and having a party afterwards.  If you don't go to church then why do you want the baby christened?|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	As your not church goers perhaps the vicar feels it would be hypocritical and that you are just using him for your own convenience.  Why not have a naming ceremony instead?|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I am not quite sure why you would want your baby christened if you are not planning to attend church.  I would suggest that you find a church and have your baby christened and keep going to church as a family.  I joined my church when I was pregnant the first time and my children love attending Sunday School and Church.|`|c7cf72298a7b440a9bcaa961b4b36e6aaa	i should hope so. church is always looking for more people, so why would they turn you down? they probably wouldnt know you dont go anyway. if you want ur child to be christened then i doubt they will try stop u. gd lk.
mDkUmEUzaa	Meat??  Apparantly its not even classified as a meat.  I doubt it matters whether you are pregnant or not but it aint good for you.  Eat a tub of lard instead......|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	Ha ha I went through I 3 week stage of pregnancy when I had to eat it every night before going to bed.

However, if you eat chilis with it, your baby might object.|`|6kue5meiaa	I'd not take the chances unless I knew specifically what sort or scrap or trim was used. In THEORY, the meat used in Americanized commercial Gyros could be called "donna" because its a blend of lamb (or goat) and beef ... but it could be anything.|`|N1IqgXfvaa	Yuk, i wouldn't have it when i'm not pregnant. Do you know what is in it?|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's donner meat as in a donner kebab.

0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Bring the cream to your DR & ask her to take a look at it & see if its ok. Or look at the box & see if there are any warning on there like "DONT USE WHILE PREGNANT"...Im pretty sure you will be ok though because your baby is protected in the uterus & nothing can seep up there & hurt the baby.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I think itd be okay.  your not ingesting it.|`|YhjFiVGyaa	it is safe to use...however with the excess body heat and discharge u will have with pregnancy it will clump up inside of u. i found that when this stuff gets warm, it gets clumpy and once i went to h ave sex and it got all over the guy! i douched it out and it was gone after that but u really dont need it.  u might want to realize why you are getting so many infections...i used to get BV a lot and would be put on metronidazole for it. i started using rephresh which helps, but then the doc said that if u wash ur area with too much soap, you will get BV. i started using fragrance free Dove down there and not even a lot, and the BV never came back.    there is such a thing as being too clean there. it totally throws ur healthy bacteria off and u end up with an overgrowth of it.    another thing that helps, douching with vinegar and water products. stay away from the sented stuff. vinegar is perfect and doesnt wash away good bacteria...it also evens out Ph. (hint hint it also tightens u up a little )
w0eRRsoVaa	I've seen Kaige...not that it really makes a difference when it's said outloud lol, it just looks less like a dog cage and more like a name when it's spelled out but, whatever floats her boat.  I've heard Kaige Syracuse before so I know it exists as a name.    Gage would be the better of choices then again you can also attribute that to different gauges in piercings and medical terminology.|`|2owaSpf0aa	No. I don't even like Gage.  Cade/Kade is actually OK. I quite like it. Caden or Kaden would work with Cade/Kade as the nickname.|`|bVIewZe9aa	nah afraid not, it makes me think of a violent dog trapped in a cage.  Emma (:|`|eG7pYnGxaa	Cage? Why the bloody hell do you wanna name someone that? Think of all the kids at school that will take the p*ss out of the poor lad.     They'l all be asking him to look after their animals|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Cage? No. I would laugh if I met anyone named Cage.    EDIT: Cade, on the other hand, is my all time favorite boy's name. I would suggest that. I love it!|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	I prefer Gage and Cade over Cage|`|qitXGd0qaa	Cade or Gage are alright, but Cage is a little strange. However I did go to school with a guy that went by the name Kage, his real name was Karl. It worked for him, but HE was a little strange, so the name fit, lol.|`|Vw9dvel1aa	I love Gage... Cage... not so much. Sounds like an animal. LOL!   Cade is good! I also like Cash. Good luck!|`|nkM6wmv6aa	nyeh.  that's a no.|`|LIJ6Ti4yaa	no,not at all|`|NroZQN5vaa	I hope you're joking. There are so many nice names. Why Cage?|`|ruGhNDmUaa	No, not at all.|`|50a2f650d6231d429cc40022d211f70daa	No. It may sound nice now but think of when he is in school getting made fun of for having a name that is also an object used for containing animals and wrestlers.|`|qr8yxOBfaa	not really but gage sounds good !! That was the little boy's name on Pet Semetary.|`|1BlTO6Kxaa	i like Gage.....with a 'g"|`|ZvASEWHPaa	not particularly. actually, since it's not your baby, ill be totally honest and say no, not at all. what are the other options?|`|8mchLCQhaa	Cage is a horrible name. Does she want to cage him? Gage is much better|`|9CAXUgOZaa	No way. I hate Cage.    I love Gage, though.     Cade isn't bad...it's not too common.|`|wHOQXToHaa	Noooo, no Cage or Gage. Cade is OK though- I have a friend who's boy is Cade & it's a nice name.|`|57X92zknaa	No, it reminds me of the movie Pet Semetary.    I like Cade, and I don't think it's as popular as Caden. But then again, all the Cadens I know go with nickname Cade.|`|08kH822qaa	how about Cadel - pronounced ka-DELL.     Other options:  Gage  Grant  Graham  Carter  Slade    I don't like Cage...|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.I like Gage.Cage is something you keep someone or an animal in.|`|koOpJPhEaa	Cage is all right, it's actually kind of cute.|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	I like Caden Quinn.    also like Caden Jack    and Nicolas Cage with Cage as a middle name might be a compromise.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	like Johnny cage from mortal kombat YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (yes i am a girl and i like mortal kombat) I think it is unique and I like unique. Why walk around with 20 other people with the same name???|`|OHfZFR31aa	Not really.

R0sfdiNeaa	sounds so pretty|`|2AdJStDYaa	i like it! catchy!|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	I'm not big on the name Leann, but I like the middle name.

J6vd8Gsbaa	It is all normal. Babies grow in the belly very fast and the last month is the most. Then you really wont feel anything. As you little one grown the less room he/she will have to move around. About the rolling ...normal and yeah it cracked me up to. My husband said it look like I was in the movie alien lol. Looks like it huh. I actually could see my 2nd sons head at one point. He stretched out all the way I could feel his feet in my back and my belly went semi flat except one little round bulge. I loved it because I got to rub his head before he was even here. LOL Congrats!!!!!|`|RtskgjPKaa	this is very normal the baby is also growing so the room in your belly is getting very tight so yes it is common for the kicking pattern to decrease as long as there is still some movement the baby is fine but you can always do what i did if i feel a little uneasy about things i got to the nearest women's center good luck with the baby!!|`|ioZeveazaa	Yes it is all normal. You are now coming into the third trimester and space is getting very limited. You are ok though. Don't worry. =)|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	That's normal :) as he gets bigger you'll be feeling more "rolls" and "shuffles" as opposed to kicking. Remember babies also have lazy days & have awake and sleep patterns. Congrats!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Very normal.. Babies also go through sleep and awake patterns.|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	Yes it's normal...and don't be afraid when he stops moving much more. Only because he's getting bigger and wiggle room is minimal. LOL...but don't be alarmed. But yes, the rolling is normal and it feels really weird.
XE45S6OTaa	I lost my plug in early labor.  It was two days before my daughter was born.  GL|`|nbSp469Waa	With my first, I lost it while I was in early labor, I was induced with my second so lost it while I was in labor, and with my 3rd I lost it about 12 hours before I went into labor.  Congrats, here's to an easy and quick delivery.|`|9TfKeq9Eaa	I lost my mucus plug the day before I went into labor. But I believe that was only because the doctor stripped my membrane.|`|AAmOXLUiaa	I lost my mucus plug and then had my daughter 3 days later. But I've been told everyone is different. But good luck!|`|xnhwmontaa	Your mucus plug doesnt mean you will go into labor....you can lose it two months before your due date...your body will just replace it with more plug....|`|L5ohOquHaa	I lost my plug a month before. It all depends on your body. I was almost fully dialated 7 days before i went into labor. My water had to be broken because when it broke on its own... it didn't break all the way. But it could be anytime now or later. Best of luck to you!! If this doesnt help... call your dr and see what they say!|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I lost part of mine at 4am and the rest at 7am.  I walked into the other room after I lost the second part and the water gushed out (like in the movies!) I was 35 weeks and 5 days.

wENdWT5kaa	If you are under 40 weeks i don't agree with self-inducing, there is nothing natural about it. Natural indcution/labor is letting the baby choose when he wants to get here.     But i'm going to assume then since your dr. gave you the ok, you are 40 weeks or more.     First, do NOT do Castor Oil. It won't work if your body isn't ready and all you will do is sit on the toilet and can be dangerous to the baby.     But just walk, squats, up and down the stairs, spicey food, and also use a birthing ball.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	The only thing that had made my contractions stronger has been accupressure.     The spot between the thumb and finger webbing and the spot by the bottom of the spine.     http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/...      I can't find the sight I used that had a lot more information, but if I do, I'll send it to you.|`|A0NfgNEiaa	nothing will work trust me the baby will come wen he or she  is ready i tried everything and i had my little girl a day before i was to be induced lol    take care|`|Y5c4uZ4Maa	Spicy food is one way, but unfortunately...sexual stimulation is the best way, even if you are by yourself, it can still be manageable to do, for example when you are in the shower or tub you could use your imagination. Since it is not the act of sex that induces the labor it is the stimulation of it all, it can be done alone.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I tried everything. And, nothing worked. My best advise is to not do the castor oil. I had life off in 30 minutes and it wasn't contractions. Wiping your butt 9 months pregnant is a chore as it is...doing it with self induced diarrhea is even worse.     I just walked a lot and rubbed my tummy while singing to her!|`|MsipL0Mzaa	keep doing your chores just dont over do it....you can look up on internet..tips to naturally induce labor....i never found anything that really worked for me.....goodluck ..let us know if you find something that works!!...lol|`|t5KoPRVbaa	castor oil and orange juice, or raspberry tea or acupuncture. But I tried EVERYTHING with my lil guy (now 5 months old) and he just didn't want to come. they finally had to induce after 2 weeks of being late. The fact is if he is not ready nothing will make him come.
0b9cd0c215da9ba41c5fbca675289e28aa	I like:    Rose  Rosalie  Rosealba    I love the old fashioned and classic-ness of Rosalie and Rosealba, I think those names are just lush and gorgeous.  And Rose is always beautiful.  The names I like the least are:      Rosa- I like this name aloud, but I'm not partial to it when its written.  Rosalina  Rosabella- seems like a name a little girl would make up.  Rosana- Pronounced Ro-sana, which I don't really like.  I think it would be better spelled Roseanna.  Although still it makes me think of that show, Rosanne.  Rosita- This is a spanish nickname for a girl named Rosa, meaning "little rose."  I don't think this is a name a girl could grow up with.  Rosina- I just don't think this sounds pretty.    Best of Luck.|`|ugNWsFXyaa	Rose.|`|93b7b24cc4b3ba428911ea6130ff091aaa	Rose is my favorite|`|1OpcR7bZaa	I like Rosalina best|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I like Rose, it's cute and sophisticated.|`|LGPOESonaa	i like rose  you can call her rosie or something.|`|R0sfdiNeaa	Rosalie|`|ac4b51e4dd9a1ac339ede85a6869a7a1aa	I actually prefer "Rosemary" over any of these - and I really like the herb rosemary in stews!!|`|OHfZFR31aa	Rose or Rosalind|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	I like Rosalie and Rosabella.

be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I had the same thing at 9 weeks but my bleeding was severe (like a whole period in a few hours) and then I spotted for the entire next day. And everything is fine. My symptoms went away a week before the subchorionic hemorrhage.    My doctor has an ultrasound machine and I will get them weekly until its gone, they also gave me progesterone supplements to help the placenta heal. I am also not allowed to climb stairs, lift anything and limited amount of walking. Did you get those instructions too? How about the progesterone supplements?    I would get a second opinion because the treatment I just described is the standard treatment for subchorionic bleeds.    9 weeks is really early to find the heartbeat with a doppler.|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	I would not expect for your doc to be able to find the heartbeat at 9wks. So I wouldn't worry about that.  The prognosis of the pregnancy really depends on the size of the subchorionic bleed. If it is small, don't worry about it. If it is large, you'll have a harder time.   I don't really think of a subchorionic bleed as an "abruption". I usually see abruptions later on in pregnancy as the result of something (trauma, smoking etc).   SC Bleeds are very random and usually go on to be normal pregnancies. Your body will just absorb the blood.   I would say odds are, you'll be fine.    To answer your question that you asked, yes, with an abruption you would have pain and bleeding. (I usually see this >20 wks).|`|Wps4XuqHaa	Well i havnt had the placenta problem you have so im not sure how to answer that part of question but i can tell you that not many doctors find the babys heartbeat on a doppler at 9 weeks!! Thats very very early and most midwifes dont try to find heartbeat till about 12 weeks. So please dont worry about that!! If you still have sore boobs and nausea then i suggest there is still a nice healthy baby in there to give off the hormones! Im 11 weeks pregnant now and my symptoms are starting to fade, they actually started about a week ago. But my boobs still hurt and i still get bouts of sickness throughout the day, mainly in the evening. Im surprised you wernt sent for a scan sooner tho when your obviously now going to be worrying!! Good luck, but im sure you wont need it!! :) x|`|xnhwmontaa	I found out I had this at 16 weeks i think....They should have had a ultrasound right after...I bled so much with so much clots i thought i was having a miscarriage but i didnt My doctor couldnt find my babys heart beat with the doppler but when i had a ultrasound we found it! Best of luck to you!
jgDlkSiWaa	Sorry to hear of your loss.  I mc in March 07 at 11 1/2 weeks and also had a D & C.   I had no pain-just a little sore.   I was told to wait one period then try. There is no medical reason to wait and longer.   We waited to time the pregnancy so I wasn't pregnant all summer, so we waited til July and got prego right away. My DD just turned 10 months old!!   Best of luck!  I would do whatever you feel ready for!|`|Brqd1YcDaa	first of all sorry for your loss. i have had two d&c's done. the first was very painful with heavy bleeding and hurt for weeks. the second had little bleeding and no pain.   you might want to take the dr.s advice that said wait three months. that way your baody has more time to heal. start taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid. good luck.|`|kw4ksbkXaa	Sorry honey. Since you had the D & C pretty early it is common to have light cramping and bleeding, although some women have heavy bleeding a bad cramping, consider yourself blessed! A lot of women also experience their first period after a D&C to be very heavy and this is just your body's way of cleaning you out. I think you guys have a great plan of waiting for your Next period, this will ensure your body is healthy and back on track and you will be very fertile at that point. Best wishes to you
miPubuDYaa	Yes california rolls are ok. Just ask them not to roll it in anything.     Also you can eat, spider rolls, cucumber rolls, boston rolls, tempora shrimp rolls, special california rolls, sweat potato roll and any roll that contains crab, like king crab rolls.     I used to eat sushi twice a week or more. We are down to once every 6 weeks. I love the stuff but its so temping to get a spicy tuna roll, we had to cut down. I asked my doctor and he said as long as the restaurant cant verify that its cooked or doesn't contain fish than i can have it.  I asked the sushi to mark every roll a pregnant person can eat - minus fish or cooked fish and there was quite alot of choices.    My hubby knows that after i give birth and i can have solid food(having c-section) he is bringing 3 spicy tuna rolls, miso soup and a ginger/orange salad and i'm gonna eat them up!|`|9iXGakohaa	As long as it isn't raw you can eat it :)|`|mxixfE3Raa	No. None.|`|yOyg3gnJaa	Doctors ALWAYS say to stay away from sushi, no matter if it's raw or not.  Even though the California Roll is NOT raw, what if the person making the rolls cross-contaminates the California Roll with a Salmon or Tuna Roll, and you would inadvertently digest the raw contamination?  I'm sure very infrequent splurges on the California Roll are okay, maybe stay away from the fish eggs?  I'm sure you will do what you think is best, and congrats, mommy!  Good Luck!|`|IecRl5wMaa	no,.....your doctor will tell you to stay away from all sushi.|`|jgDlkSiWaa	California rolls are okay because it's cooked. I ate them all the time when I was prego!. I ate the eggs too.   Calamari is also cooked so it's fine.   I wouldn't eat a lot of it. Maybe once a week?|`|MfCkiJCVaa	I know it sucks, but your doctor (like mine did) will tell you to stay away from all sushi. =/|`|zQQkRR6paa	I ate lots of sushi while I was pregnant. I just made sure to avoid anything raw and anything that was known to have high mercury.  I CRAVED shrimp tempura sushi from my local place and had it all the time, as well as California rolls. My doc said it was just fine.|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	No raw fishs, meats or eggs|`|lys5kB9Daa	my best friend is 7 months pregnant and she eats california rolls and calamari rolls all the time. as long as its cooked you are fine :)|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	yes,the california roll is fine,but like you said no raw fish or any other kind of raw meat.  good luck.
iwYu32N2aa	dont bother answering any of her questions she is a liar|`|IP2suWFTaa	Tell him that you don't mess with other men that are already involved in a relationship.If he wants to be with you he will have to end it with her first.But be careful,because if he does this behind her back hes more likely to do this in other relationships.You posted this question in the wrong section,if you re post it in the right section,you might get more answers.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Why are you in the pregnancy section?|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Since this is in the pregnancy section I'll assume you are asking if you can get pregnant from that and the answer is no.
TUNvbXbgaa	I love it. Great Name|`|LIJ6Ti4yaa	wao i like that name.it feels like your son is a king or someone famous|`|NroZQN5vaa	I like it. It's very classic.|`|ORa2ZNAlaa	:) yes I do! :)|`|sYokzKJgaa	Yes. Iys timeless and he can always fall back on Jon or Alex. CKiewl|`|wHOQXToHaa	Oooooh, I really like that name! Good choice!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Very nice.Two of my favorite names.|`|qfsVYQMraa	It's strong, it's classic. Two good names. Flows well. I like it!  :)|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I like it,always have, and you can have a nickname for when he's younger and he can grow into it.|`|LGPOESonaa	yeah its a cute name, but its kinda realllly common!|`|nAOlBmzDaa	Its long for a boy but yeah, its nice. Sounds dignified...  and will probably end up being Jon...|`|OHfZFR31aa	Wonderful masculine name - sounds very strong|`|w0eRRsoVaa	I quite like it :)|`|GpY2SF0oaa	I love it! I love Jonathan (the name and a person!)   Alexander is always one I have loved! I have always had Jonathan Lucas on my list but Jonathan Alexander is sooo cute too!!  Good luck and congrats
pM2EQ4MQaa	what does that have to do with being pregnant??|`|DutTBV3caa	well are you walking around acting like your some skating champ?   if you are then yes youre an uber poser..  but f youre owning up to not skating and being open about just liking the clothing then i dont think so..|`|l0NRdN3Faa	The term poser is used by posers.|`|uIg6an6Jaa	yea if your a dude   kinda if your a chick
mc6YtaRbaa	That is not true. They actually offer water aerobic classes for pregnant women. The only thing they say is you should not get in a hot tub because you don't want your baby to get too warm or take a hot bath with bubbles or salts. If you take a warm bath that is fine, but not a hot one. As far as the sun goes, some sun is good for you, but listen to your body. Don't get really overheated as your baby is already warm enough so make sure you take enough dips in the pool to keep you cool. Have fun! I wish I could go!    If that were true, then pregnant people wouldn't be able to take showers!|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	that's not true. i was like 20 weeks and i went swimming. obviously the only thing that is not safe is going into a hot tub. i went in there anyways, but only for awhile but you're body will tell you if it gets too hot. anyways, just letting you know.    yeah you can go and swim. that's the best excercise there is.  so enjoy it and don't listen to those ppl who dont know what they're talking about.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	swimming is actually the best excersize to do while pregnant...just make sure its not freezing or over 100 degrees. and the sun is okay as well just use sunblock to protect yourself :)|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Swimming is fine. Just don't jump into any water. They urge pregnant women to stay away from forcing water into their vagina. Be careful swimming in ocean..sometimes the water is pretty forcefull and can knock you down. As far as the sun, just wear sunblock and don't let your body get too hot. No basking in the sun :)  Baby's body temp is 3 degrees higher than yours so if your body temp reaches 102 and stays there for over 15 minutes, baby's body can reach temps to 105 and over and that is dangerous. Have fun!!!!|`|ostF23Omaa	no swimming is fine. It's a good exercise. Just don't over do it.  Have fun!
mc6YtaRbaa	You can have sex however you are comfortable. If he gets too ruff, your body will tell you, but he's not going to harm the baby.|`|ee61e5c9182f80497740aeecc845e0edaa	You are just fine.   Unless your doctor tells you to abstain, and gives you a reason, there is no risk at all to the baby.      Congratulations!|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	Rough sex is fine when ur pregnant.... unless the doctor tells you otherwise!! have fun, because sex is much much better when ur preggo... your cervix (gpsot) swells up, and makes sex so much more enjoyable and orgasms easier to achieve. (atleast that's been my experience)|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Your baby is safe if you mean he is rough with your vagina...  As long as he is not rough like on top of your stomach...
53GH38Qiaa	If you even had a faint positive then in my opinion you probably are. For some women pregnncy tests don't come out completely positive until they are 2-3 months pregnant. Just make sure you are eating right and taking the right vitamins just in case you are. Pregnancy tests, test for the pregnancy hormone, so unless you got a bad test if it says yes AT ALL then you are pregnant(but like I said you could have gotten a bad test).|`|ZJohgu1saa	See ur GP. they will be able to tell u if ur pregnant or not rather than just thinking u are. If u are congratulations. x|`|c7cf72298a7b440a9bcaa961b4b36e6aaa	well hun...all i can sugggest is going to your doctor and get a blood test done. if that's negative then the pill may be playing with ur system. the pill sometimes tricks the body into thinking its pregnant. was on the pill for over a year and a half, and got symptoms quite alot. as for the faint positive before the three negatives.......i dont know!!!! but best of luck anyway. go get that blood test done and put ur mind to rest!!!|`|Cx6KfBUbaa	when i found out i was pregnant with my last child the line was very faint to ,but they say as long you see a line (faint or not ) your most likely are....keep your head up and go see your obgyn, if there test comes back either way....they can do a quick blood test.....good luck
nrqWwQBXaa	a little small?|`|nPFyW0czaa	yeah just a little|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	YEAH!!!|`|uAt5NIk6aa	yes,  you really should take him to see a doctor or something. That's very strange.    Unless his parents have small feet, it just might be in his jeans.    hope this helps!|`|mXS3ZpPHaa	Aww Cutee!! They're Not That Small!! Im In Year 9 And I Was A 2 0r 3 In Year 7.. Now I Am A 4 Or 5 .. I Know . Grown Quickly!!!!!!!!!!!!- But Im A Giirlll... They're Fiine.. Tell Hiime Not Too Worryy|`|2xS1Jro7aa	yes my 7 year old niece wears size 1
wiAVa1H5aa	It's kind of the way it is, kids hit growth spurts and they GROW, would you like him to not grow?   My sons seem to grow in their feet, then their limbs and then their torsos and then they fill out, he's just getting ready to gain some height.  If it were me I'd believe him if he said they don't bother him, it will bother him when his toes are cutting through the tops or he's wincing in pain when he runs - but until then let him be.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Whether he likes it or not he needs new shoes. When he has shoes on you should be able to have him stand straight and be able to feel at least enough room for the top of your thumb to go down without touching his toe. He needs growing room. And if he wears them all of the time and the sole is worn out...definitely get new ones.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	If you are very concerned, buy him a new pair of larger shoes and get rid of the ones that are too small.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	Is that why you asked last time if he should wear white socks? They are way to small for him if his toes are pushing up against the front of them. You need to get him some new shoes! Maybe they are his "lucky" shoes so he doesn't want to get rid of them or get new ones? Tell him that this weekend you guys are going to go and he can pick a new pair of shoes and can still keep the old ones and put them up on a shelf or something and that he can take the lases out of his old shoes and put them in his new shoes? That helped my cousin when he grew out of his fav shoes. There is nothing wrong with him being small now im sure he will hit his growth spurt soon! Feet are the first thing to grow when your going to have a growth spurt. If he doesn't start to wear shoes that fit better he will have long lasting effects on his feet and even his back and legs. So really get him some bigger shoes. Good luck and make it fun for him to encourage him to be excited about picking new ones!|`|0QYIbn1saa	Dude, why do you keep asking the same thing?  Issues man, issues.  Get the kid some new shoes already.
w0eRRsoVaa	You have a lot of colors you can play with.  Seeing as you didn't give the sex of the child, I'll go ahead and throw these out to ya:    Light green  Light yellow  Light blue / Icy blue  Light - medium pink  A light reddish-brown    I also recommend printing out a copy of the painting and going to Lowes or Home Depot to look at paint chips.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Nice but remember the child will not always be a baby  .  One day they will not want little kids stuff all over the walls  .  And the only one that will enjoy the mural will be mom and dad  .  Family and friends the child will not appreciate it   .|`|a3MSSvdcaa	a light green or maybe cream color...or a soft yellow|`|mc6YtaRbaa	There are so many colors you can chose from in this picture. A light yellow or light green would work really well as it will put out some of the colors from the sky and grass and trees in the picture.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	Very light green or very light orange!|`|DutTBV3caa	pale yellow or an icy or pale blue.   very cute idea by the way :)|`|utfoP7GWaa	pail yellow would be pretty|`|zx4DfJz5aa	me and my bf did like a creamy tan-ish color called creme-brulee     looks amazing
Y32zA5Mfaa	You could get a copy of the ultrasound pic, and wrap it up to give to them.  That's what my cousin did, and my aunt nearly lost her mind she was so happy!|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	With my first, I gave the HPT...pee part removed...as a birthday present to my MIL, since I found out days before. I called my mum and said "hi Nana" when she answered. With  2 I wrote "I'm going to be a BIG brother" on one of my son's shirts when we went to visit the grandparents.|`|G5Ut9prSaa	I'm going to give my parents a "Birthday Party Invitation" with the ultrasound picture inside.|`|9TfKeq9Eaa	I know a woman who told her mother in the cutest way! When she went in for her first ultrasound she had the ultrasound tech type a little message on the picture before she printed it. It said "Hi grandma". She put it in a cute little baby frame and wrapped it up and gave it to her for her birthday. I thought that was just so sweet and she was completely surprised. What a great gift! Of course if there is no special occasion coming up, you could just give it as a gift anytime.|`|yznZqcznaa	I scanned the Ultrasound picture and sent it to them saying da baby.  They thought it was my cat because I send them pictures regularly.  My mom called and said... whose pictures are there?  I said, mine.  She said... from when.  I said today.  She says???? Are you pregnant?  My dad thought they were from when I was a baby.  So he was like Wow how did she find these, then he noticed the city was local, and that the date was yesterday.  I like that they had to work to figure it out, and they were amazed to see my little baby.  I was 8 weeks 2 days and the baby was looking like a baby.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	get your ultrasound photo and put it in a card :) thats what im doing!|`|067in9BMaa	Go out and buy a new outfit for little one. Then next time you see your parents, tell them you got a cute new outfit. Hand the bag to your mom or dad so they can pull out the outfit. Congrats on your new bundle of joy!|`|NroZQN5vaa	Buy them a card that says Congratulations on being a grandparent. That would be so much fun.|`|mg2xcZK8aa	My brother was 16 when he got his girlfriend pregnant, he called my mom on mothers day and said "happy mothers day grandma"    and she kept thinking he was just trying to call her old but she finally got it.    and my boyfriend told his mom the same he kept calling her grandma|`|Iqifd3SGaa	Well with my first pregnancy they just found out. With this pregnancy we waited to tell them after 20 weeks because we lost our first at 20 weeks. How we did it was put the ultrasound in a frame that I made and gave it to them as a present.     Here is the picture of the frame before we put the ultrasound in it.   http://i42.photobucket.com/albums/e306/b...|`|wGg5NGUeaa	Give her a set of knitting needles and some yarn with a baby booty pattern.      Ask if your parents have saved any of your baby stuff because you are going to need it.    host supper witha  baby theme, baby carrots, etc. and for dessert do a cake with congrats grandma and grandpa on it    show up with a baby on board t shirt
pXSKSS3daa	My little boy will be ONE in two months. I cannot believe it. Just yesterday I was still waking up with him at night and newborn clothes were swallowing him up! Okay... it wasn't yesterday, but it seems that way.    Now he's all over the place with crawling, pulling up, etc. and it's crazy to see this big boy in front of me. He'll always be my baby, of course, but his features have changed so much from that of a newborn to that of a little boy. Sigh.    Anyway, yes, I know exactly how you feel!|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	It's unbelievable, at the top of the stairs, I have a picture of an adorable baby boy, too young to smile, staring out of the window whilst lying on a cushion.   He's now 6 and playing with grown up USB toys!  Every day I see that picture I shake my head in disbelief.  Do you know, I couldn't wait for him to get to the next "milestone" first smile, first word, weaning, sitting, crawling - etc etc.  I couldn't wait - how I wish I had just enjoyed each stage.  My second one is 15 weeks and I look at him every day and think, slow down, you're growing up too fast!!  I take time to enjoy every moment.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I just went and had a bunch of pictures printed from my memory card yesterday, and seeing all those pictures of when I first brought her home, kinda made me sad.  They do grow so fast, I brought home this little peanut, and I was so scared I would break her!  Now she's four months old, and I can't believe how fast it has gone by!  It's like you can't wait for them to grow, so you can run around and play with them, but then your you get all sentimental when it come to packing away their clothes when they go to a new size, I know I do anyway!|`|nmu6coapaa	Yea I cant believe how fast it goes! My little boy is still only 9 weeks old but it has been the quickest 9 weeks ever! Are you from Ireland by any chance? It's not often you see someone saying 'canny' on here! It's a really Irish word!|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	My eldest is 2 :( *crying* ) I feel like I just gave birth to him never mind my 13 month old WOW (don't tell my husband but im getting a little baby happy I want a girl now)|`|XOtOMncwaa	Yes, my son was running around the house the other day, and all I could think was "wow, it seems like I just had him!" It's amazing how fast they grow, I just wish time would slow down a little that way I could enjoy it a little more!|`|EHY3FnAmaa	yeah my son is only 4 months and I cant help but look at him and wonder when did you get so big?|`|50lIaC8zaa	Yep my daughter will be 9 months in 2 weeks (19th) and its gone soooooooooooo fast i cant believe it.     When you have a newborn and are having sleepless nights it seems like its gonna go on forever, then one day you wake up and your celebrating you child's 1st birthday (scary!!!)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	uuugh i feel old and i'm only 21- my son will be TWO in April. it feels like yesterday. and then he reminds me it wasn't when he talks to me|`|zwctZ812aa	I can't believe how fast they grow.  My son is 3 months old, and while I know that's not very old, he has changed so much in his short little life.  He was very colicky for the first 2 months so this wonderful happy baby he is now is such a welcome change.  It just makes you want to cherish every minute with them though...it goes too quick!|`|DDIBEvUTaa	These past 5 months have gone by faster than any 5 month period I can remember!|`|dOeE9GCcaa	I know! My daughter is almost 5 months and I look back at her newborn pictures and I just cant believe it, it makes me want to cry. It seems like yesterday I gave birth to her. I never thought I would say this but I also miss being pregnant. Best wishes to you and your son!|`|bc9inzicaa	OMG yes!!!    He is five (almost six) weeks old and it seems like only yesterday that i was pushing him out into the world.  The time seems to be flying by so fast!|`|cPlDc7I1aa	My 'baby' is 5 and a half now, and the older 'baby' is 10!!!  I tell you i do not know where this last decade has gone!!  It is very scary!!  I still remember bringing them home in their car seats and settling them down in their moses baskets, like it was only last week!!      Blink and suddenly they are growing up and you think whoa, wait a minute, when did THAT happen!!!    ...added:  what's really interesting is when they start school and get their school photos taken every year.  It is amazing how much difference you can see in them with each passing year!!|`|oXzHvsBpaa	I feel the same way. My baby is 3 months old today and according to some places no longer considered a newborn. I can't believe it that my son is now an infant.|`|8t8NjjnVaa	It only goes faster as time goes on!      My first daughter is now 8-1/2 years old and my little baby girl is turning 6 years old this month.  I don't know how that's even possible. It seems like she was just learning how to walk a few weeks ago!    I tell her she's gotta stop growing and she just says "I've tried and tried, but I just grow!"|`|mNzgWFkGaa	I know what you mean , my son has just turned 3 there and i'm thinking oh my god i cannae believe i'm taking him to nursery school now  and he's up past my waist already! and ah, i need to buy new shoes and trousers AGAIN!   But it's just Brilliant as well , jist you wait till you see the changes in the next coming year, It's gonnae be Amazing!|`|QCVzUC1baa	My son is 4 months and I do not know where the time has gone, it didn't go this quick when I was pregnant! :-)|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Yes time speeds by.  My son is already 10 months.  I feel like I was just pregnant the other day! Someone already asked what I'm doing for his first birthday.  I can't believe it's coming so soon!|`|AA11210211	ohh yeah my daughter turned 1yr on saturday and it's like WOW where did the time go.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Yes! My daughter is 3 weeks today..... amazing where the time goes!
yNbGq4viaa	I would suggest having Cydnea talk to him herself and reassure him that she is going to come home after school.  Maybe you could try being a visitor for lunch one day at your daughter's school and your son could go and see where his sister is every day.  It sounds as if he's just scared right now and having a hard time understanding why his father has to be gone so much.  You could possibly get him his own alarm clock and set it to when you KNOW your daughter will be home.  Mark down the numbers of the time when Cydnea will be home and tape it to the clock.  Explain to him, when the clock shows 3:00 then Cydnea will be back.  Just some suggestions.  I feel sorry for your little guy.  Best of luck.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	With toddlers it becomes routine. Sounds like he doesnt want his sister to go, so he threw a fit about it one day, and now its his routine. I wouldnt let him throw a fit over it, just like you wouldnt let him throw a fit over anything else.    Theres no reason to project all these other issues and emotions into it. children this age really are this cut and dry. Either way, the job of the parent it to teach, show and demand rational behavior because we're training them how to deal with real life situations later in life. Its not acceptable to throw a fit and panic every time someone leaves.    He can learn trust, self control, and patience, not how to throw a fit and have an emotional break down. But he's going to learn that because you teach it to him, show him what it looks like, and demand the same from him.|`|v0596BTeaa	Does he know where her school is?  It might be an idea for you to go and collect his sister from the school so he can see where it actually is, we all know what 'school' is,  he may not really understand, if he can see that it is a non-threatening place he may be calmer.|`|suLTN10laa	since he is so young, I would advise having your daughter (and dad)make a video (if you have a camcorder) of her saying she loves him and she'll be home soon, and to be good for mommy, etc.  Another strategy would be to drive her to school one day so that he can see where she goes, show him the buses, and stress they bring her BACK from school.  Another idea is to put him in a play date, or half day preschool so he can have "school" just like his big sister!  This way he will get more socialized and focused on having fun with others besides you and sister, he will gain independence!  Good luck!!!  I know it's hard for you|`|AA12166238	been there done that    check with the base they have all sorts of stuff to help with that  such as trips that are free and free food and ours even had activities and goodie bags for all the kids (all ages)    the base should also have playgroups and such so also check into those   it is a great way for you and him to make friends going through the same thing    also make sure to explain why daddy is gone and when he will get back he is old enough to understand      my daughter had pictures and a daddysaur with his voice telling her night night when she was 3  she has been through many deployments and understands wonderfully    also the other thought is he is old enough for preschool maybe you could try that|`|GXFQAKeraa	the base family support center has videos and such that will help with the separation. it is hard when they're too young to grasp time. to help explain the difference, get a ajar and fill with with something (marbles, pennies, rocks, daily vitamins, anything). have your son remove one every day until his dad comes home. that will help him visualize it easier. just be sure to add to it if his deployment gets extended. in turn, make something that he can see that his sister will be returning shortly. you could put stickers on the clock to show when she will get home. or maybe her picture on the clock showing her eating for lunchtime and a bus for when she gets on and off the bus. make the morning time a job for him. tell him, this is the time when sister leaves, don't let her miss the bus. and (if she'll let you :) ) walk to her the bus stop for a few days in a row. explain to your son that if he throws a tantrum, you will have to watch from the window. instead of concentrating on her leaving, count how many kids are on the bus, how many red backpacks, what do you think the kids have for lunch, does that boy have a pet dog at home etc. anything to lessen the impact of her leaving. you may have to follow behind the bus one day to show him the school. maybe for awhile plan to leave the house at the same time sister gets on the bus. she gets on the bus and you guys get in the car. it doesn't have to be a playdate. you could go to the laundry mat, the grocery store, rent a video, go to the park whatever. make it your time of day to exercise. when sister gets on the bus, your son goes into a stroller and you try to beat the bus to the end of the road. then walk around the block. you get exercise and he gets distracted. it is a different routine with dad gone so now he feels like everything else has changed. just keep pressing on with whatever routine you pick and everything will level out.
mc6YtaRbaa	Symptoms vary by person. Most people don't start getting symptoms until about 6 weeks, but a lot feel them sooner. The symptoms of pregnancy mirror those of PMS so it is hard to tell them apart. Most common symptoms are fatigue and frequent urination.|`|AA11427561	sore boobs|`|2JqajMgeaa	You will start feeling sickness and get strange cravings for food, your appetite will also increase within the first 6 weeks
gwuTKiNXaa	you know I have the same problem I notice the other day... I was told that you normal get that during ovulation. so maybe your ovulating right before your period that is the only thing that I can think of. Really I truly understand what your talking about|`|mc6YtaRbaa	That mucus you should get during ovulation time, which is approx 14 days prior to your period. You should get a clear mucus for a couple days leading up to ovulation then the white mucus when you have already ovulated.
vue9NOhYaa	He cannot be weaned from formula to whole milk until he's around a year old .. so you have a couple of months yet. (Milk doesn't provide the right balance of nutrients for him.)    He can have SMALL amounts of whole milk (like, cooked into foods or mixed with mashed potatoes) now.|`|pXSKSS3daa	When he's closer to a year in age.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	One more reason I am a breast feeding supporter.    He needs formula until he is 12 months old, and even then he may not make the transition to whole milk well or easily.   Please don't skimp on his nutritional needs now, you have 2 months to go.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	only 2 more months to go... and yu should slowly do it.. not all at once.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	At 9 months most pediatricians take blood and check their iron levels. If the baby's iron level is okay you can start them at nine months. Other doctors say 1 year. Just depends on your doc.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Have you considered applying for WIC?    They will help you with formula and after 1 yr to 5 yrs they will help with milk (which is ridiculously priced) cereal, cheese, etc.    You should take full advantage of this program.|`|qStmw7qgaa	The new thing is a year old (used to be 6 months).  He is 10 months though...I don't think it would be an issue to give it to him now.  It is so much cheaper.|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	a year|`|NroZQN5vaa	Not until he's a year old. And ounce for ounce, whole milk costs the same as the off brand formula. If you're using name brand, just switch to the walmart or target brand and that should help.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	You should ask his doctor but most say 1 year or older. formula is expensive but that is no reason to put your babies health at risk.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I started the transition at about 10 1/2 months.  I did a gradual transition.  When he normally had a cup of  formula I would replace one ounce of it with milk. I increased the amount of milk and decreased the amount of formula by one ounce each week so in 8 weeks he was completely switched.    My sister-in-law did it the same way except for she used it as an opportunity to wean off the bottle as well.  She would give her the formula in her bottle and the milk in a cuppie, and by the time she was completely switched to whole milk she was also off the bottle.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	My daughter is almost 11 months and I have started to give her one bottle of whole milk a day to make the transition a little easier. I know "they" say to wait for their 12 month birthday but I'm guessing that your mother didn't I know mine didn't wait that long. And we made it this far right?|`|XOtOMncwaa	I started weaning my son when he was 11 1/2 months the first week I took an ounce of formula away and added an ounce on milk everyday, then the second week he was completely on whole milk... with bottles... the day he turned a year old I took his bottle away, he did fine, and actually never fussed once for his bottle I got very lucky... but wait until at least 11 months old, and if you decide to start then just do it very slowly, maybe take an ounce of formula away every 2 days or so instead of everyday.|`|UghJ0XROaa	At 11 months, i started mixing 4 ounces of formula with 4 oz milk for a bottle a day and my daughter had no problems.    SPGASS-There is no magic number, it's not like at one year their body can magically process milk. It's not going to hurt to start using some whole milk.|`|jgDlkSiWaa	It is recommended to wait til they turn one.   My ped just told me to start my DD as soon as the formula runs out (She is 10 months 1 day) Birthday 4-4-08  I am going to wait till at least 11 months, then slowly transition.    EDIT:  Ethel: Maybe she couldn't breastfeed, and you making a point of being a breastfeeding supporter could make her feel bad. I couldn't nurse due to low milk supply, but fully support nursing. I would've LOVED to nurse for a year, but physically couldn't. Please don't make comments about nursing. She didn't ask for it!|`|E7tHE2J4aa	Typically it is a year, but the doctor let my sister switch my nephew at 10 months because formula wasn't enough for him anymore. Call your doctor and ask them what they think.|`|xq8Kn7Phaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOUR BABY'S STOMACH WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROCESS THE MILK JUST YET   WAIT 2MORE MOS TILL HE/SHE IS AT LEAST A YEAR OLD  IT WILL COAST MORE TO TAKE THE BABY TO THE DOCTOR AND MAYBE NEED MEDS FOR THEIR UP SET STOMACH JUST STICK IT OUT A LITTLE LONGER
aJxAb1OCaa	Pooh is very easy to find, there are also different Poohs, like classic and modern day Pooh.  I love Winnie the Pooh, and you don't nec. have to have EVERYTHING pooh.  Just the bed, and mobile, and curtains will do.  Incorporate other "pooh" colors like, Yellows, reds, and greens... they should also have girl pooh things, where you could use pinks and greens.  And because pooh lives in the forest, you can use flowers, and grasses,... soft colors would probably go better with the Classic Pooh, though.  Pooh is loveable, friendly, and welcoming for babies, I think.  Just keep it simple, don't go Pooh crazy, and you'll love it.  You can get a pink stroller and car seat, w/o any characters, and it will still go with the pooh theme.  Just pick up the essential pooh items, and the rest can just "blend" with him.|`|cjqOUq5xaa	NO POOH for a girl!! There are so many cute patterns out there! Pick something more for a girl!|`|0uhRgfcsaa	i say ya cant go wrong with pooh bear :) thats what my little girls nursery is done in. congrats :)|`|0722e5ddd4c6c3cb4e310338f3c85935aa	I am doing a pooh room if I have a girl or a boy! I think pooh is great for either sex.|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	I say Winnie the pooh!|`|NroZQN5vaa	I wouldn't go too girly with it. I say go for the Pooh theme. Then as she gets older, you can read her Pooh books and she'll appreciate the Pooh theme more than flowers.|`|jk6ayFUmaa	well alot of people do pooh but at least you know you will always be able to find pooh things until your baby is older and you change the theme if you do. or you could do just girly nothing to specific you know you could do pink and purple flowers and butterflies! then you can make it what you want.|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	I think winnie is great but if you want to go more girly what about butterflies or faries. stroller or baskets if you do the basket thing why not go for a a sage green color it can go for winnie the pooh or flowers etc.   I hope find what you are looking for best of luck :o)|`|1bnhwGACaa	id do something more girlie   i haven't found out yet what we are having but i picked a flower and butterfly set   and a pooh bear set for a boy   i am going to go the day we find out and buy a dress or boy outfit and take that to my hubby at work to tell him|`|NPmRmnG6aa	We are having a girl and I really want to repaint our babies room, but my husband really hates painting (the walls are a really cute shade of green).  So I am making him paint polka dots all over the walls. The bedding I chooses is yellow with pink and green polka dots. I like your winnie the pooh idea, I just would not go over board with winnie the pooh stuff. I would just keep it to the bedding and maybe a few pictures.|`|XCueIYnYaa	I have a couple girlfriends who both had babies last year. They both did Winnie the Pooh. Things were really hard to find in the area that i live for pooh themed items. Also they both are getting really sick of all the pooh in their homes. I think it wold be a good idea to mix things up, have pooh and register for some pooh things ans some solid items or others baby themes. I would just hate to have you get sick of a theme too. Im expecting a baby in Aug and i have color themes Im doing, and then as far as items im going to have a variety.  Best of Luck to you & Congrats!|`|EHY3FnAmaa	You seem to be set on Pooh.  Just go with what you like best, today when you go to register just browse and see what catches your eye.  I just had a son 4 months ago. We did his nursery bright green with rainforest.    If I have a girl in the future I know her room will be super girly!

I remember being told to double check and make sure the name was spelled right before I signed the paper.     the only thing you can do is call the number or go to the website|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Go to the SSA office and fill out new forms.  You may need to wait until you get the birth certificate first to show proof.  Make sure it's spelled correctly before you approve it.  Then get a new SS card.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Call the number on the social security card and ask them.    Try the webpage below.  It tells you what you need to do.|`|dp7VR8BJaa	Are you sure it was the hospitle that mest up?|`|955YoHvVaa	When I got my daughters SSN and her Birth Cert both of them came with a sheet to correct any mistakes to it and mail all the documents back along with the filled out sheet to get it corrected.|`|IXqCB5oqaa	Was it the hospitle(hospital) that mest(messed) up or was it you that mest(messed) up?
vue9NOhYaa	They don't have to drink milk at all.  It's a valuable source of nutrients, but there is nothing in milk that can't be had from other sources. (Think of all the kids who are allergic to milk.)    So, don't worry about it.  They may come to like it eventually, or not.      If you really want to encourage them, try flavoring the milk a bit.  A few drops of chocolate syrup won't hurt them, and may make it taste better. (You can then, if you wish, try reducing the amount of chocolate until they're drinking it straight.)    We are lucky enough to live in a society where we have SO many food options that it really isn't an issue if someone doesn't like one or two foods.|`|c8XHnKV2aa	Alan Greene, the author of the second entry had the most helpful advice.  " If a baby begins to regularly take less than about 20 ounces per day, you might want to offer the bottle first and then solids." Read his article to better understand the context. He says there are always variations and to use your intuition.  http://tinyurl.com/b32sdr|`|AA12166238	throw out the bottles and let them help  they are old enough now to be told no and understand what you are saying and even should have began conversing back (if this is not the case you need to talk to their doc about it at there 3yr check. My daughter started speech therapy when she was 3 and is now 4 and it has done wonders for her speech)    tell them that they are big kids now and the bottles will mess up their teeth    try chocolate (or other flavors) milk in kiddie cups (not sippy cups they should be on regular cups now)    EDIT: if you go for flavors then make sure the milk looks different and tell them it's whatever flavor you use
YseGAHIfaa	i had light bleeding & i knew that it wasn't really my period. i waited two weeks & i did a test & it was positive! i'm now 3 months pregnant with  1! it's possible to have a bit of a bleed & be pregnant - i'm living proof..!!     best of luck..!!   =)     x|`|9B1FVdnPaa	You might be pregnant but its best to go an see your doctor|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Some spotting at the time you would expect your period is common during the first month of pregnancy, so it is a definite possibility that you are pregnant. Any bleeding during pregnancy should be reported to your doctor though.|`|QvhPJAKyaa	eah ou cud still be pregnant, but ou should go to our doctors.|`|blauCpU5aa	re|`|wBVuFu3Baa	The doctor will tell you over the counter tests aren't always accurate!
fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	your gf needs to Relax it was just a joke... if she cant laugh it off then she sounds like she would be nothing but drama... getting mad about every little thing... just find a new girlfriend one that can hang with family without braking out in tears|`|M6c0hUefaa	Yikes, how old is she?....She really is overreacting on this one, but I guess it really hurt her feelings. All you can do is tell her it wasn't you and swear to her it's just your brother's nature to play pranks..Say something like "Oh, he does it to everyone, like one time this happened......etc..." and try to comfort her and make her realize she isn't the only one he has pranked. IF she can't look past it, then you'll either have to wait for her to come around (if you're willing to do that) or just get over it and realize maybe she isn't the right girl for you....but really, who doesn't like a fart joke? Especially one played so well?...LOL|`|WqsJf4kgaa	You're young, and plenty of other girls out there. This one seems a bit too uptight.|`|vGxipYJnaa	You family is sort of right - do you really want a girlfriend who can't laugh at a silly prank? If she's that uptight she doesn't sound like much fun. Sure, the prank was stupid - but she should be able to get over it.|`|IP2suWFTaa	She has no sense of humor if she is going to let something like that bother her that much.If something like that happened to me,I'd be embarrassed at first,but would laugh it off and think of a way to embarrass him.Just ask your self if you want to try to work things out with a girl that takes things to seriously.If you want to make it up to her,see if your brother can apologize to her and tell her that he wont pull something like that on her any more.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	if your girlfriend can't take a fart prank from your bother then she is not needed over there all people pass gas you me and the dogs all pass gas. She problie just got overly embarrassed because it was in front of her friend and your her new boyfriend. Also its hard to say you didn't know about it happening because you know your brother likes to pull pranks.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Ask your self this question: Do I really want to be with someone who has no sense of humor and overreacts to things that easily?|`|7qAWqNw5aa	well she was obviously really embarrased nd stuff, get your little bro to tell her da truth. nd never ask parents for advice,     just try nd get her on her own at skl or sumet, nd tell her wat she needs 2 hear or talk to her frnd nd get her 2 explain it 2 her|`|1hLxd5DWaa	Its probably nothing to do with the prank and more to do with the fact that she doesnt want to have a boyfriend who is so childish to have a good laugh at someone elses expense, yes she probably did over react but what you did was mean and its a nervous time meeting someones family for the first time, she probably feels that everytime she comes round your house now thats all you will talk about and she wants someone grown up for a bf not a toddler!|`|OxoumjYJaa	Ok....i am sooo sorry but i laughed! D: Try sending her the message that you typed into Y! Answers. OR! (This one HAS to work) Tell one of your friends to show her this messages (But delete this answer and make a new one with copy and paste) and then hopfully she will find it in her heart to " I'm afraid that I've lost her forever" That is sooo cute! :D I'm 13 but i know when to stop. he sounds very immature! He also sounds very stupid!|`|dLHquAsqaa	Well everyone so far has sed 'she's obv not worth it if she cant take a joke' etc, but I can totally see it from her point of veiw! You say it was the first time she visited yours, so she was maybe a little tense and self-concious...you sed 'She got up to get something from the kitchen' and tbh maybe she checked how she looked in the mirror, and stuff, but then when she sits down again theres this noise and horrible smell and i expect your brother went 'ewww thats gross' or something stupid and she must have been so embarresed!! so she runs off to hide her red face and shes really upset- i expect she just wanted everything to go well on her first time to your place... soo then she finds out it was all just a joke! so now she gets angry and susspects you (i expect you must have laughed a bit- even a tiny giggle or something - you couldnt help it) and tbh it does sound a bit lame 'oh i didnt know at all- it was my kid brother' etc... so i can totally see it from her point of veiw...but now she has to let it go. if she doesnt beleive you when you say 'i promise i didnt have anything to do with it' then shes not worth it, cause if there's one thing you need in a relationship it's trust. So what i'd do is write her a letter saying something like-  'I'm really sorry for what happened. You honestly have to beleive me that I wasn't in on it, I would never do that to hurt you. My brother thinks its 'funny' to do it and he plays that prank on so many people! It's really stupid and I'm really angry that he did that to you! I can see where your coming from, I bet it was really embarrassing, but I know it wasn't you! =) Really, there's nothing to be embarrased about! So I'm really sorry that happened. It won't happen again. How about we meet up again to set things straight? Even if you don't want to get back with me, let's go out somewhere for a drink so I can tell you to your face that I'm sorry. I've been missing you so much recently! We really need to talk. Love x'  -yess I dont know how that sounds to you but say something nice and I wouldn't point out that she's overreacting, even if you think she is, because I promise you that to her, she's not. at all.  Hope I helped a bit!  Sooo good luck!!! =)  x    ohh and ps keep in mind that sometimes girls are really sensitive, and lets face it, alot og the guys are rather the opposite- so go gently =)|`|7k6ejiXHaa	IT was just a joke after all. Life and relationships are full of complications and if she cant take a joke and still be with ya, then maybe she is not the right one after all. YOu have tried to explaine to her that  you werent involved, you have done all you can do. If she doesnt want to be with you, shake it off like a grain of salt, smile, remain friends if that is an option and keep it moving, There are alot of people and situations in this world and something so simple and mild should never be the cause of a relationship to be broken, and I see it like this, she was never serious if something so petty could cause her to disolve you from her  feelings. GOOD LUCK|`|i3pn4jNcaa	try going for a more outgoing girl really. shes too uptight & if she cant even trust that you werent in on it then its not worth it.|`|4KHDjq62aa	You should of defined her, you have to understand a girl dont want a man that cant make her feel save.|`|SivOCxSAaa	if she reacts like that then shes not worth it|`|wYaM0UJUaa	She sounds so boring. Why do you care if she can't take a joke? she probably likes the attention shes getting off you.|`|Tgt3cRF7aa	leave her!!|`|ce4b535ba7b008940070f2af3b9db2fbaa	do you really want someone that is that sensitive? I mean jeez you will be walking on eggshells all the time. That was a harmless joke. She should have been able to laugh.|`|JmjhtAgkaa	how would you feel if her brother did that to you. seriously  , i agree, she might be scared of visiting your place, now thinking that everytime she goes, theyll make fun of her, or might be exposed to your silly bro jokes. i am sorry,, but i think this girl is a keeper, she deserves respect, if she doesnt get it, she moves on, and thats it,,,, do you really want a girlfriend, who would laugh at stupidity and let other ppl disrespect her. what kind of ppl does that to someone he just met,,, only uneducated, if i was your mom, ill make your bro apologize with the girl.. maybe she is going to  be better away from your family, i am sorry.
21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	I'm probably not spelling this right. Preclampsia is the big one. If that is not caught in time, the woman can die from it.    Another thing that I know of my friend had. When she was pregnant with her second child she developed this rash. Nothing that they could give her did a thing for it. They induced her instead of waiting for labor to naturally start just to treat the rash. Later she found out its this "condition" that happens when fetal skin cells get into the woman's bloodstream. You take a sample of the area on the womans body, and there will be fetal skin cells in the sample. I am really sorry I can't remember the name of it. This was five years ago when it happened to her.     Hope that helps a bit.|`|Y5c4uZ4Maa	This is a good question, hope you let us know what you find out. My daughter is in her first trimester, I have had three children and I still do not know the answer. I think I am going to look up "illnesses in pregnant women" right now!|`|cTfxbeQ2aa	there is actually a really weird disease that you pretty much have an allergic reaction to your child while there still inside of you. Its called Pups. It looks like a rash but it makes you want to scratch your skin off and it burns really bad, Its extremely rare, But my daughters mom had it from 6 months in until 2 hours after she had her. There are a lot of other diseases out there one good place to poke around is MEDMD.com    Good Luck with the paper
067in9BMaa	She just began feeling him move. It is a fairly new feeling so there may be times when he is moving and she just doesn't know it. Also baby is still pretty small so if he is in a position were if he kicks his legs they don't hit the walls of the uterus she may not be able to feel it. I wouldn't worry about it just yet. But if you have concerns never hesitate to go to the doctor. It's your baby and you can never be too careful with your precious little one. Congrats!|`|MfCkiJCVaa	It sure is. After the baby get's bigger it starts running out of room. When it starts getting itghter for him/her in there he can't make the big movements he used to. Tell the OB about it and they'll tell you that. =)|`|Kg5KX432aa	definitely  My baby had days where I swear he was trying to literally kick out of my stomach  Then he had days where he hardly didn't move at all  He was born perfect and healthy! I wouldn't worry about it unless it's a long period of time where you can't feel any movement at all
5bHHlH73aa	...........alot of things this could be.....she could be doing it for fun, asthma, prblems with lungs, ect ect|`|vGxipYJnaa	Does she have acid reflux?

MCTyWCu2aa	Put her in a carseat or a bouncer chair and set it on top of the dryer and turn it on. Or take her for a car ride. I know thats a pain in the butt to do at night but it works and you might get a couple hours of sleep. good luck!|`|qStmw7qgaa	HAPPI TUMMI!!  It saved my daughter who had it during the night too.
