The original IBM PC had a minimum of 16K of memory, but this could be upgraded to 512K if necessary, and ran with a processor speed of 4.77MHz. Ten years later, in 1991, IBM were making PCs with 16Mb of memory, expandable to 64Mb, running with a processor speed of 33MHz. The cost of buying the hardware has come down considerably as the machine's have become commodity items. Large companies are considering running major applications on PCs, something which, ten 3 years ago, no one would have believed possible of a PC.

Anabolic Steroids   Anabolic Steroids are powerful drugs that help the body gain mass, but also hurts the body with drastic side effects. Anabolic Steroids are a type of natural and synthetic hormone that stimulates cell growth and division, resulting in an increase of muscle tissue and strength. The growth only occurs when combined with physical training (Wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Steroids).   Anabolic Steroids may help you gain muscle mass, but with a high price. Steroids have noticeable side effects including acne and scars, an increased sex drive, increased hair growth in Androgen-Sensitive areas, deepened voice along with an increased vocal cord size, more or bigger muscles, a larger appetite, bone remodeling, increased production of Red Blood Cells, liver damage, headaches, irritability, trouble sleeping, and jaundice (Santella 613.8). In Males, the penis may decrease or increase in size, breasts can be developed, premature balding, and testicular pain. In Females, development of man-like features may occur (Santella 613.8).   There are many different types of Anabolic Steroids, but mostly there are oral anabolic steroids and intravenous steroids (Santella 613.8). Oral Steroids are usually pills that one would take through the mouth. Intravenous Steroids are injected into the body (Santella 613.8). Some different types of Oral Anabolic Steroids are Anadrol, Anavar, Dianabol, Maxibolin, Methyltestosterone, Primobolin, and Winstrol (Santella 613.8). Types of Intravenous Steroids include Triamcinilone, Betamethasone, and Prednisone (Santella 613.8).   Teenagers are often users of Anabolic Steroids. Teens often acquire Anabolic Steroids from dealers at school, the Internet, or some types are even sold over the counter at local health stores. For that reason, a large amount of teenagers have access to the drug for their use. As for the reason teens use steroids, those who have admitted to taking them have said they used them to be better at sports, "fit in" or "be sexy" (Santella 613.8). Statistically, Male teens are more prone to use anabolic steroids than female teens, because males are more likely to try to get an advantage in sports. About 14% of athletes in the 12th grade were found to be using steroids, and about 13.3% of 10th grade were found to be using steroids (Santella 613.8).   Teens have even made up their own slang terms for Anabolic Steroids. Some of these names include "juice", "gum", "candy", "pumpers", and "pops".    "Arnolds", and "Stackers". Such slang terms can be used as "code names" in order to keep them secret from adults or authorities (Santella 613.8).

20090221055233AApYVwf	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Shall anyone help me to write the following article in another way, please! 10 points for sure!?	Anabolic Steroids   Anabolic Steroids are powerful drugs that help the body gain mass, but also hurts the body with drastic side effects. Anabolic Steroids are a type of natural and synthetic hormone that stimulates cell growth and division, resulting in an increase of muscle tissue and strength. The growth only occurs when combined with physical training (Wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Steroids).   Anabolic Steroids may help you gain muscle mass, but with a high price. Steroids have noticeable side effects including acne and scars, an increased sex drive, increased hair growth in Androgen-Sensitive areas, deepened voice along with an increased vocal cord size, more or bigger muscles, a larger appetite, bone remodeling, increased production of Red Blood Cells, liver damage, headaches, irritability, trouble sleeping, and jaundice (Santella 613.8). In Males, the penis may decrease or increase in size, breasts can be developed, premature balding, and testicular pain. In Females, development of man-like features may occur (Santella 613.8).   There are many different types of Anabolic Steroids, but mostly there are oral anabolic steroids and intravenous steroids (Santella 613.8). Oral Steroids are usually pills that one would take through the mouth. Intravenous Steroids are injected into the body (Santella 613.8). Some different types of Oral Anabolic Steroids are Anadrol, Anavar, Dianabol, Maxibolin, Methyltestosterone, Primobolin, and Winstrol (Santella 613.8). Types of Intravenous Steroids include Triamcinilone, Betamethasone, and Prednisone (Santella 613.8).   Teenagers are often users of Anabolic Steroids. Teens often acquire Anabolic Steroids from dealers at school, the Internet, or some types are even sold over the counter at local health stores. For that reason, a large amount of teenagers have access to the drug for their use. As for the reason teens use steroids, those who have admitted to taking them have said they used them to be better at sports, "fit in" or "be sexy" (Santella 613.8). Statistically, Male teens are more prone to use anabolic steroids than female teens, because males are more likely to try to get an advantage in sports. About 14% of athletes in the 12th grade were found to be using steroids, and about 13.3% of 10th grade were found to be using steroids (Santella 613.8).   Teens have even made up their own slang terms for Anabolic Steroids. Some of these names include "juice", "gum", "candy", "pumpers", and "pops".    "Arnolds", and "Stackers". Such slang terms can be used as "code names" in order to keep them secret from adults or authorities (Santella 613.8).

20090220184209AA5mjM6	Education & Reference;Other - Education	What should I do?? I am desperate to get back into school!! wow.. haha i cant believe it but its true!?	okay, i have a question about my school..      Im a senior on the last semester of my high school career, and I have pretty much upheld good grades, and almost a perfect A average.      Well, on Monday I was called up to the office and told that I was suspended out-of-school for ten days, and I would be given a tribunal within those ten days to try and prove my innocence.      Well, there are two rules In the category of the rule book I may have broken. One is "Computer Trespass" and the other is "Computer Misuse" and I was filed under the first one, "Computer Trespass". Computer misuse yields a punishment that is far less severe and does not include expulsion. I strongly believe what I did was Misuse, however I do understand what I did was wrong, and could very well be "Computer Trespass".       I'll explain exactly what I did, and what I used it for. I used the portable version of "Firefox", a free web browser, and went through a proxy into a server to bypass the firewall and get to "Facebook" (Yes, I know that now in retrospect it was remarkably stupid). They called me into the office and had some pictures as evidence of my school account going onto "Facebook.com" and they explained my punishment.       I have two problems with this, one being that I might have been punished for the wrong rule (Thinking maybe i broke misuse as opposed to trespassing), and two being that I received a much harder punishment than others with the same issue.       I will also explain that I hosted the "Firefox" with the proxy already set up on my web server available for anyone to download. Some of the other kids in the school began to catch wind of this, and began downloading the program. I use the program for other things outside of school as well, so I did not notice, and even if I had, what they choose to download is there issue. I am legally allowed to own and run this proxy and host this program, and I have checked with my hoster, as well as Mozilla, the creator of "Firefox". The other students who were caught with the same program were given one day of inn-school suspension and nothing else. I was given a report that stated I distributed the program to other students, which is not true, however even if it were, I cannot be held responsible for what others choose to download onto their school accounts. They found out that I was the owner of the proxy and expelled me when I technically did not commit anything more than the others, seeing as though running a proxy outside of school is 100% legal. So I believe if I am being expelled then that would mean the dozens of other students should be as well.      I have already taken the initiative to e-mail my teachers and ask for work while on suspension and I have also e-mailed my principal hoping he could override the assistant principals decision. My teachers all have e-mailed me back and told me that they would talk to the principal to inform him that I am indeed a good student. My principal has not e-mailed me back yet, and it has been almost a week. I am running out of ideas of what to do. I was thinking of maybe getting my local news involved because my school is a "school of excellence" and any media disturbances would be devastating to their reputation. I am just really upset by this and I am trying to find a way to be allowed back in to finish my senior year. I would even be willing to help them fix holes in their network in exchange, or really anything. I truly am sorry for what I did, all I want is to finish school.      Here is the actual report I got:   "School tech. specialist discovered inappropriate programs in student's folder. It was later determined that student was using program to bypass the school filters and all of the safety protocols. Student also shared the program with other individuals. OSS 10 days pending tribunal Feb. 18-March 3."      Thank you for any help!

20090221053254AAUAAM0	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you edit this for me please?	Would you take a bullet for me?            A question asked by my best friend. Did I ever think that it would be asked to me? I actually never thought about it. Never took my precautions for these kinds of questions. I was speechless, didn’t know what to say, and didn’t prepare for an answer before. Well, this question will teach me to think about life again. But let’s get back to the important thing here. The question. Maybe she meant it in another way. A way where she’s asking do I really mean to you? But this is her, I know her, she only asks what she means. To tell you the truth, I love her very much; in fact I would take the bullet. Nothing in this life is more important than my friends.         But after thinking about death, there’s another question, would she take a bullet for me? Didnt think that its as hard as this. In reality, people don’t really take bullets for other people, they only say it just like in the movies, if this is it, then im included with them. This is the fact, we say that we would take the bullet, but will we really do that in reality?

Upgraded Gym                Don't you hate it when you go to other school's and they have these amazing basketball nets, new basketballs, and many other sports equipment. Well I do! We can raise money for many other things why don't we raise some for our gym?                          We have fundraisers for school trips, new play ground equipment, new school books, and sometimes even new sport equipment, but when was the last time you saw them get new tiles for our gym or new basketball hoops and backboards. I think that we should be able to do fundraisers for things we want to do, not just new basketballs and volleyballs and tennis balls, and any other thing you could think of, we should be fundraising for new hoops, netting, backboards, tile's, basketballs, volleyballs ect..., rackets for badminton and tennis , new curtains for our stage, and lastly new stage flooring and lighting.               I think that one of the biggest things that i don't like about going to the gym are it being very crowded. When you walk into the gym for an asembuly or  phisycal education, it just isn't quite as enjoyable. When you are in an assembly and you hear teachers yelling at people for talking when they should be paying attention to the presentation, alot of the time it is because we are so close to our classmates or schoolmates that it is impossible not to talk. One of the best things about having a bigger gym is you may have two classes in the gym at once, Eg. when I went to a school in Burlington there was a massive gym just split in two with a movible door, so if there were multiple classes in the same period you just move the door over, also if there is just one class then you have a really big gym! I think this would be perfect for our school.                   You could fundraise by just selling candy grams, or selling candles ect...Or you could go one step further and do multiple events at the same time for example if you rented a place out that you could have a road hockey tournement, sell food and drinks and maybe have a 50, 50 draw or sell candles or candy grams depending on the time of year. All in the same venue. I think this would work efficently for our school.       If we upgraded our gym it may eventually pay for itself, we could rent it out. You See if we rented our gym out right now it would not get it's use as much as if we had an upgraded gym that people would actually pay money to rent out.

Heres what happened,      For me school starts at 9 am today. I went to the gym at 7:45, got back at 8:30 (just jogged). When I got back the door was locked, and all I had was my iPod Touch. I had a sweatshirt and shorts on  and was all sweaty, then 20 minutes later it started to snow... I sat there for like 45 minutes, then took a walk down the street and asked some random guy for 50 cents to use a payphone to call my dad. I went to the payphone but my dads phone was off. I went back home, then I went to a locksmith. He said he couldn't help me. Then I went back home and waited until 11:00. By this point it was snowing really hard and I was freezing in my shorts. I went to my back door and broke the window (I fixed it). Will I get in trouble for skipping school? I called my friend and he said they are having an early release at 12:00 because of the snow, so it would be pointless for me to go (takes me 20 minutes to get to school). I'm not too concerned but still..

20090203092234AANljCr	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Forgiveness letters for student loans......how effective are they?	One of my students that graduated from the university 5yrs ago is definitely unable to pay for his outstanding loan debt of $40,000.  He is currently in the mountains in Cambodia volunteering teaching kids how to read.      He tells me that he has chosen this way of life for 3 reasons:  First, of his love for teaching.  2nd, since the economy in the U.S. is temporarily not doing good at all, with the millions of layoffs going on, he is unable to land a teaching job in the states.  And 3rd, he basically refuses to go on welfare in the U.S. and would rather be doing something constructively in exchange for his free room/board and meals.    He loves his job but finds it impossible to pay his student loans.    What should I tell him?  I heard that if he writes asking for forgiveness and explain his situation, he could get a discount or something.    Also, how bad is it in the U.S.?  What's happening to all those college kids that can't find a job, hence to pay off their loans as well???    Thank you kindly everyone,   Have a great day.  D.

20090203081720AAHDxb3	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should parents be sued for asking questions about their schools management?	This article appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer today.      Devon charter school sues parents   By Martha Woodall       Inquirer Staff Writer      Several parents at the Agora Cyber Charter School in Devon who asked questions about the school's finances have been sued by the founder and her management company.    Dorothy June Brown contends that the parents and the Agora Parent Organization defamed her and Cynwyd Group L.L.C. in complaints sent to the state Department of Education and in e-mails circulated to other parents at the statewide cyber school.      The parents say they were just trying to get answers about the relationship between Cynwyd Group and Agora. The cyber school rents its headquarters from Cynwyd under a nine-year lease and pays the firm a management fee of at least 4 percent, according to a services agreement. Brown owns Cynwyd and serves as its senior consultant to Agora, according to school and state records.      The civil suit Brown filed in Montgomery County Court on Jan. 21 alleges that the parents made misleading statements "that give the clear but false impression that Dr. Brown is corrupt, incompetent and possibly criminal."      The suit also says the parents' association "sought to interfere with Cynwyd's contractual relationship with Agora by spreading untruths about Dr. Brown and by implying that she had improperly used public funds."      Brown and Cynwyd are seeking more than $150,000 in damages for libel, slander and civil conspiracy.      "The allegations are false," Gladys Stefany of Milton, Pike County, said in an e-mail yesterday. She said she learned about the suit last Tuesday when she was served with papers.         'Civil conspiracy'    "When did asking for information that is or should be public information become 'civil conspiracy?' " asked Stefany, who has a 15-year-old daughter enrolled in Agora and is president of the parents' organization.    "It is sad that it has come to this, but I'm happy we'll finally have the opportunity to air our case in the open and get answers to our questions."      Stefany said the questions did not involve the school's academic program. She said she was more than satisfied with the instruction her special-needs daughter has received.      News of the suit left several lawyers and education officials scratching their heads.      "I haven't heard of a case of this sort in recent memory," Len Reiser, co-director of the Education Law Center in Center City, said yesterday.      Lawyers from the Pennsylvania School Boards Association agreed.         SLAPP suit?    Angelique Smith of Aston and her husband, Ira, are among the six parents named in the complaint. She said she believed the case amounted to what is known as a "strategic lawsuit against public participation" (SLAPP) and was meant to intimidate and silence critics.    "This is really about freedom of speech and freedom of association," Smith said. "This is akin to going to a regular public school and telling the PTA to get out."      Brown referred all questions about the suit to her attorney, Wendy Beetlestone. Beetlestone said it was a defamation case and not a SLAPP suit.       "In any kind of public discussion, you have to make sure that what you say is true and doesn't bring down the reputation of the person you're talking about," Beetlestone said.      She said parents had failed to respond to requests to stop spreading information that she said defamed Brown.      "June Brown is a highly respected and innovative educator and has been for many years," Beetlestone said. "When the debate turns to making false statements and doing everything they can to bring her down, she is left with no other option. That's what this lawsuit is about."      Brown is the founder of three traditional charter schools in Philadelphia. In 2005, she and Brien N. Gardiner, founder of the Philadelphia Academy Charter School in Northeast Philadelphia, co-founded Agora to provide online home instruction to students across the state.       The school Web site listed Gardiner as a co-founder, but his name was removed in May after he became the subject of a federal criminal investigation at Philadelphia Academy and was fired from his consulting position at the charter.      The lawsuit against the parents claims Gardiner "had no role in founding Agora and his name does not appear in Agora's application for a charter or in subsequent organizational documents."      Brown's lawsuit also charges that Agora parents tried to imply that she "was guilty of some financial wrongdoing on the basis of her association with Gardiner."      Records show that Brown and Gardiner did business together. In 2005, they established Cynwyd Group as an educational management company, state records show.      In November 2007, the company paid $1.9 million to buy a property at 60 Chestnut Ave., Tredyffrin, that houses the Agora headquarters. The relationship between Gardiner and Brown was severed in May 2008.      Gardiner and others were removed from Philadelphia Academy in Ma

How and why I have aquired some nasty judgements and garnishments (and still paying back child support - my regular is done since both my kids are over 21), is not relevant at this time - email me for details, I want to take care of these bills, but not all at once, and certainly not via any type of J/G method.  already had both our vehicles repo'd (ugly feeling) which then made me loose my job. I cant maintain a good job without a vehicle (its used for 90% of my work) and definately not with over 50+% of my check garnished - I dont want to file BR - so question remains where can i keep my money (right now we're doing the shoebox ) but that leaves us open to theft of course and other bad issues.       even as this is written we just paid off another debt (there are tons more that are not in the "J/G" pile that we are working on) but our savings is slowly dwindling and our self employment work we stumbled on is starting to pan out - but i want to make it legal and get the taxes in place get more materials and maybe hire a few people to expand, but doing so jeopardizes our income again.    or do we just keep it where its at.     We are tired of staying in the dark.   any ideas? or just get another shoe box?      If your profession is financial and have some good ideas i'd love to hear them.
