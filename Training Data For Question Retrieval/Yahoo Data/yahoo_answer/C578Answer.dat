Do you find that your sitting there and you realize you've got all your muscles stiffened up (like when you're watching a horror movie)?<br>  If so, that's anxiety.

Look up for yourself and see the benefits of gelatin.  Probably your skin is just not producing collagen like it used to, and is becoming frailer and more transparent.<br>  <br>  Also, as you get older, your veins, and especially capillaries, also become weaker... and the ones underneath your eyes are some of the weakest to begin with.  The weaker they get, they will start to exude blood.<br>  <br>  But believe me... try adding more gelatin in your diet.  It will help.  You can get unflavored gelatin, and add it to anything you're cooking, and you won't even be able to tell it's there.|`|eBEfZO9eaa	Steep some teabags then let them cool, refrigerate them and then put on your eyes.  Also cucumbers.  Not only do they help with dark circles but also puffiness. Also, even though 55 is not "old age" skin does get thinner over time making the dark blood vessels more noticeable.  You may need to use a moisturizing undereye cream. Good luck.|`|d15523b6f2eb977e0485a8956eed4c73aa	Sometimes it can be genetic, depending on your ethnic background(s).

ufgv7oTjaa	Unfortunately there are none... at least not the way you're thinking. Most Calcium products would help with the health of the bones, but none that can force them to grow.<br>  Really, nothing can force your body to grow taller than your DNA says you will. There are some things that can take away from your potential height (including smoking, drugs, caffeine, etc), so as long as you stay away from those and have a healthy diet, you should grow as tall as you're supposed to. Besides all that, your growing age normally peaks around 20 years old, so if you're younger than that, you've got plenty of time to finish growing and any HGH pills (or other "artificial growth" products) can actually be detrimental to your height and/or health. If you are over 20 years old, HGH won't help with height anyway because your bones would have already fused.<br>  However, if you're already 6'5", that's much taller than the average and you probably have time to grow still... heck, you might even grow more than 2 more inches, who knows.<br>  Good luck and I hope I helped!
PHzWq3anaa	You basically would have to get an advanced degree in medicine, biochemistry, chemical engineering, etc.  Then you could work at a teaching hospital or become a professor at a university and apply for research grants. The other option (also requires and advanced degree) is to get a job as a scientist for a pharmaceutical or biotech company.  Sorry I don't have a more specific answer.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I re-read your question, and it appears you aren't really asking about how to research and study new drugs, but rather just the one that actually administers them?  I don't really know how you get into that.  I would guess that pharmaceutical companies hire nurses to administer the drug during clinical testing.|`|yE2vM76naa	Basically, you are either a PhD in chemistry, Biochemistry, or a Medical Doctor|`|dHg78Phdaa	Become a doctor first of all.

ccyqb0v3aa	You need to call her nearby family, friends, and authorities and get them to check her into the hospital for treatment and surveillance.  Don't hesitate or delay.  Don't worry about her getting mad.  Better have her mad and alive than the other way around... She may be angry at you at first, but hopefuly she will get the right treatment and will eventually come around and see you did it out of love.  She's not herself now -- she needs professional help RIGHT AWAY.|`|YXnq4AtVaa	oh god thats a hard one, well iv tryed suicide but for stupid diff resons. she is probly feeling the same as i am so ya she would want to kill herself, its the fastest reilever there is to so much pain. i would just stay with her, by her side as much as possible so she knows you really care, she wouldn't try to do anything with some 1 around so just talk to her, try to get her mind off it and comfert her. she should see a theripist. I hope your friend changes her mind on all this :(|`|MEnKHoJwaa	She came to you because she trusts you. She knows you "tried" suicide so wants to open up to you...really I think you should just spend more time with her. Letting her talk about the things that upset her and feel someone cares will help a lot. <br>  <br>  Let her know you care! Let her know that things will get better, and this too shall pass. Tell her how strong she is to have made it through tough times, and how happy you are that you didn't kill yourself.  Really...reach out.  Suggest antidepressents...seriously. THEY HELP!!!!  I know its kindof depressing to get on antidepressants...but they help with anxiety if nothing else. <br>  <br>  If she seems very serious about it..call the good samaritans. look them up online...good luck!!!|`|voTyeJexaa	if your friend is really REALLY serious about commiting suicide, you need to contact her parents, or whoever lives with her or takes care of her. really, if shes serious tell someone IMMEDIATELY. suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. she needs love and support right now, and serious help. <br>  <br>   don't leave her alone. Call 911 or your local emergency services provider right away. If necessary, take her to a hospital emergency department yourself. <br>  <br>  If possible, find out if she is under the influence of alcohol or drugs or may have taken an overdose. You may have to remove items that could become weapons of self-destruction, such as guns, knives or pills. But don't put yourself in harm's way by doing so. <br>  <br>  If the danger of suicide or self-harm isn't imminent, offer to work together to find appropriate help, and then follow through on your promise. Someone who is suicidal or has severe depression may not have the energy or motivation to find help on their own. <br>  <br>  you can help her too by <br>  finding a qualified doctor or mental health provider <br>  taking her to appointments <br>  sorting through health insurance policies or benefit information <br>   If she doesn't want to consult a doctor or mental health provider, suggest finding help from a support group, crisis center, faith community, teacher or other trusted confidante. <br>  <br>  although you're not responsible for preventing someone from taking  her own life, your intervention may help her see that other options are available to stay safe and get treatment. <br>  <br>  Be supportive and empathetic, not judgmental. Listen to her concerns without interruption. Reassure her that help is available and that with appropriate treatment she can feel better about life again. Don't be patronizing by telling someone that "everything will be OK," that "things could be worse" or that "you have everything to live for." <br>  <br>  Direct questioning, supportive listening and gentle but persistent guidance can help you bring hope and appropriate treatment to her, especiallly because she believes suicide will offer the only relief<br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  update: anti-depressants DONT CAUSE PEOPLE TO COMMIT SUICIDE. it may increase the risk AT FIRST but the person needs to have enough support and self strength to resist. its not like something pops up when you go on them that says "cool, i can do this now" it only increases the thought and risk of it. it doesnt mean that that person WILL commit suicide|`|cXXJVz64aa	Contact myspace.

Yi0sksmJaa	If you are concerned about it, then it's time to make an appointment with the doctor to have him/her check it out. That's the only way to really aleve your fears. Don't feel funny about getting it checked out. I had some funny spots on my skin that I was worried about so I went to a dermatologist. They were nothing important. She told me how to keep an eye on them and what I was looking for. She was really cool with the fact that I made an appointment for no apparent reason except that I was concerned. Good luck.

481a43c36ce16419eb0d6762bb896606aa	First off 900 calories is low. <br>  <br>  If you just started then your body is prob. in starvation mode do right now it is storing the fat. <br>  <br>  If you have been constantly eating 900 calories then your body has gotten used to that. You will need to change up your diet so that the weight can come off.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to exercise.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	It is BECAUSE you have dropped your calories so low that you aren't losing.  I had to learn that the hard way.  I suggest a book called The Gabriel Method that explains this pretty well, but short version is this.. you have now made your body believe that there is a famine and you are at risk for starvation.  So it is going to use every bit of the food you are eating, waste none, and store any little bit it can as fat.  You need a sensible breakfast, lunch, two small snacks and a reasonable dinner to lose weight.  Like for instance, I lost 5lbs a week eating Kashi cinnamon shredded wheat cereal with a few berries and milk, with 4 oz of juice and coffee.  Lunch was sandwich turkey and cheese with mustard and mayo, apple, campbells soup in a cup.  Snack at 2pm another apple, snack at 4 pm some graham crackers.  Then dinner.  A small portion of meat, big portion of veggies and a half a potato.  The weight dropped off.|`|Ndr7D8BJaa	you are eating WAY TOO LITTLE. your body thinks it is being starved, and shutting itself down! bump up to 1500 calories and maintain a good workout schedule - hr, hr and a half a day. then you will lose weight once your body doesn't think it's going to die.|`|59822c54297047367d637db864ca1eb0aa	If 900 calories is all you're taking in and you're still hungry after eating, then it's unhealthy for you. You want to eat three meals a day, and nothing 2 hours before you go to sleep. You want to keep eating until you're satisfied wit the amount of food you've eaten because you want to keep your metabolism going. Starving yourself is BAD.|`|TXCDvf49aa	Go see a doctor. Even if there's no hormonal problem keeping you from losing weight, they should be able to tell you what kind of damage you're doing to your body by only consuming 900 calories a day.

mv7kD5hfaa	Most males will be 'ALMOST' full grown by the age of 19, however studies have shown that you will grow almost another full inch from 19-28.  So you are starting to tackle this problem fairly late.  However, there are many things you can do to promote growth.  Avoid the following, which have been shown to 'stunt' growth a) Caffiene b) excessive weight training (especially 'heavy' weight) c) sleep loss (we do almost ALL of our growing while we sleep, so don't skimp on your shut eye d) Improper nutrition (a diet high in 'empty' calories and fat will curb your full growth potential)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You can't be in control of how tall you will be.

For some reason I was rather prone to shin splints when i ran track. There is a few different kinds from what i read, the most severe seems to be the actual shin bone getting tiny stress fractures in it. I think that one happens after years and years of bad running shoes. I'm assuming that your pain is coming from what i think i had which is the muscles in the shins being torn a little too much form not only the exercise but from the shock from hitting the pavement. Look into some high quality shoes and talk  to a trainer for advice on correcting your step maybe.|`|3Hayam5Raa	I have them too. They are common in a runner. For me i take an advil 30 mintues before running. It really lowers the pain. Also on days that are really painful after running i ice for 20 minutes (just use a bag of corn/peas) and then heat for 20 minutes (heat bag). Do this about three of four times. When you first get them or relize you are startinig to get pain do this for about 3 or 4 days. It sure helps.<br>  <br>  There is really nothing you can do for shin spilts except wait them out but the above helps me alot. So try it,it may help you too. Good luck|`|Ndr7D8BJaa	yeah they suck the way i understand it is the tissue around your bones and muscle gets all torn up and then your bones don't have as much support and they hurt...you need some good braces to apply pressure to your legs and wear them whenever youre not running...when you're running maybe try taping your legs. also just stretch your calves all the time, that will help a lot.|`|q5jrhIRtaa	All shin splints are are tightness in the muscle in your shin they hurt like crazy but it happens.

Keeping oatmeal around is not a bad Idea either.switching to coke zero or cutting out soda all together is something you should consider, and you'll save alot more empty calories than you might think. remember to eat breakfast every morning! even you eat something unhealthy for breakfast it's better for your energy and metabolism than eating nothing.

UEAdAuqbaa	When you cry, your tear glands work hard to produce tears and so your eyes feel heavy and tired.<br>  <br>  Mostly though, it's just the emotional workout you've just been through that can wear you out.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	I’ve had similar happen, I’ve used either a Mooncup or Ladycup for 6 years, a few months ago I suddenly started experiencing cramps while using my cup (I don’t normally get cramps at all). I figure this sort of thing comes from being too familiar with your cup, it’s second nature so after a while you don’t really think about what you’re doing when using it, so insert it incorrectly or remove incorrectly. Just go back and make sure you’re using it as you should, make sure to break the seal on removal and watch out when inserting. If you’re getting cramping when wearing the cup it might be that it’s catching your cervix so watch not to insert it too high and try changing position when inserting - as the cervix will be low down and when sitting it’ll be closer to your vaginal opening so it’d be easier for the cup to catch it.

Hop scotch, watching Tv and doing sit ups, dancing, dancing, dancing? haha<br>  <br>  and umm:<br>  <br>  --- toning up ----<br>  <br>  It is possible. i think. <br>  <br>  if you REALLY try at it. just dont let any extra pounds get in the way.. <br>  <br>  just try light weights maybe..<br>  <br>  -- losing weight ---<br>  in the morning if you can wake up pretty early, thats when you have the most energy! drink a bottle of water plug in your ipod or whatever and listen to music as you run! -- thats my first step.<br>  <br>  Then you go home, eat a really healthy breakfast like fruit salad or something thats nutritonal. <br>  <br>  After that you pretty much clean the house or whatever maybe take a walk while its cool, walk your pet dog, if you have one, i like to spend the morning doing that while its not so hot outside!<br>  <br>  After that you wait a few hours being active as can be, then you relax a little and do some sit ups and lift weights to your own schedule... and your own statistics like weight height goals.. or whatever.. thats what i usually do! And then i like to stretch at the beginning of the day.. haha<br>  <br>  MORE TIPS: <br>  <br>  chew gum - sugar free. It makes you not snack because if you chew it, you dont want to snack because then you will have to spit out your gum! works for me.. <br>  <br>  thats my trick tip - now read the losing weight 411<br>  <br>  EXTRA: breathing for an hour burns 60 calories, so thats a little lift off your chest haha<br>  and sleeping is the same rate :)<br>  <br>  excersise at least 60 minutes a day if you can :)<br>  -------<br>  hey, you know what? The most unexpensive weight loss thing to do, is to try to burn more calories than you eat, dont eat unhealthy like a 500 calorie diet! All that will do is make you sick, you NEED to be healthy to lose weight properly. Im trying to lose weight too! So basically here are some tips to speed up your metabolism: Drink 1-3 glasses of green tea a day<br>  Try and eat Chilli peppers somehow, ((chilli DUH )) they help. <br>  8 classes of water a day<br>  <br>  the more active you are, the faster your metabolism will grow to be. <br>  <br>  did you know that breathing for an hour burns 60 calories all on its own? And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do! <br>  <br>  Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things.

Oblique crunches <br>  Purpose:<br>  To develop the muscles of the stomach (rectus abdominis) and side (obliques).<br>  Execution:<br>  ? Start by laying flat on the floor with both knees bent.<br>  ? Bring your right leg up and over your opposite knee and place your left hand behind your head.<br>  ? Now crunch up on an angle so that your left elbow reaches towards your right knee (exhale).<br>  ? Slowly return back to the starting position and then repeat on the same side until the required number of repetitions are met before switching sides.<br>  <br>  2.  Side Crunches <br>  Purpose:<br>  To develop the side muscles of the stomach (obliquus externus abdominis).<br>  Execution:<br>  ? Lie down on your right side in a fetal position on the mat. <br>  ? Turn your left shoulder over so that both shoulder blades are now flat against the mat while keeping your lower body pointing to the side. <br>  ? With your left hand behind your head and your right hand on your left waist, crunch up slowly until your right shoulder has raised off the mat ensuring your knees remain touching and on the mat (exhale). <br>  ? Lower yourself down to the starting position (inhale) and then repeat with the same side for a complete set before switching sides.<br>  <br>  3.  Ab tilts <br>  Purpose:<br>  To isolate the muscles of the oblique’s!<br>  Execution:<br>  ? Start by grasping a dumbbell in one hand while standing up straight with both hands on either side of you.<br>  ? Then slowly lower the dumbbell down one side of you (inhale) making absolutely sure that your back stays completely straight and both shoulders remain facing forward.  <br>  ?

You should have made sure the wound was clean before bandaging it.  The wound will heal.  As far as your sperm are concerned I think you will be producing plenty from here on in.  If the bleeding continues you may have to go to the doctor and have it looked at.  Ask your dad if you have any doubts unless you are comfortable asking your mom.  You should probably let your dad know and have him take a look just to make sure.  He will probably be a good judge as to whether you should seek further help.|`|XuhQS9wsaa	Your fine!!!!

HeB9M5lgaa	Gardasil protects against 4 types of HPV (which have been known to cause cervical cancer) the point of the vaccination is to have it BEFORE you have sex for it to offer the utmost protection. Once you have sex, you can still receive the shot. You should get it even if you have had sex and even if you plan on only having sex with the same man. You never know what the future holds. The realty is that anything can happen so why not protect yourself? Its a series of 3 shots. You get them in the upper arm and thats pretty much it the injection sight can get sore. (I had mine when I was 22 and engaged and even though I knew I had not contracted anything i still thought it to be wise just in case) Now please be aware that it does not protect you against STD's or pregnancy you should use contraceptive methods for that. Your mother cannot stop you from getting the shot, especially if you are over 18. You can go to a dr yourself. If you do not have insurance or are worried about your mother seeing it on the insurance bill go to planned parenthood. <br>  This is the website of Gardasil, hopefully it can offer some more answers to any questions. <a href="http://www.gardasil.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gardasil.com/</a><br>  This website can help you find a planned parenthood in you area <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/</a><br>  Planned Parenthood is completely confidential. This is your body and it is your right to choose what you do with it. Take your mothers feelings into consideration and make wise educated choices.

Therefore, it is the MOST affective BEFORE you have sex.<br>  <br>  Because you are in college and over 18 (assuming), you should be able to get the vacination without your mom's approval.

833a435e36344342d10e69454b7e6731aa	no, but I fasted for a day (only drank water). I prepared like 3 days before by eating less fats sugars whatever I'm like ADDICTED to, and also ate a little less... the fasting day was kind of hard, but I just drank water when i got hungry and it went away. weird though: I always got really hungry around my normal meal times, and then it would go away! but anyway, I stayed distracted around the house. I got dizzy a few times but it wasn't anything that bad. I definitely wouldn't recommend like driving or anything though. <br>  the next day, I was like 4 pounds lighter. I know it was probably mostly water, but the amazing thing is I have STILL been losing weight - it hasn't gone back up! BUT I didn't go back to my old eating. I eat 5 meals a day, about 1200 calories total, LOTS of home cooked meals. like fish, chicken, fruit veggie tofu soups salads crackers sandwiches .... alllll kinds of good healthy tasty stuff... I still have little bits of chocolate and such, but in moderation. <br>  also, it's like all my old cravings went away!

The reason you get to sample it for that prices is because you're also agreeing to a trial membership (and often times for more than one company) which will begin billing you around two weeks after you ordered your sample unless you have called them and requested to cancel.

9qXHUkf2aa	With that GPA, universities will probably not accept you. But you should still work as hard as you can during senior year to have a 4.0-5.0 GPA for the first semester and the second semester if it counts on the college application.<br>  <br>  After high school graduation, going to a community college, doing exceptionally well there, and transferring to a 4-year university would be a good route. While at the community college, you can take culinary classes, intern, etc. and at the university you can go to culinary school or get an MBA which will be good since you plan on a party planning business. You sound like a determined individual, but you can only make something out of your life if you work exceptionally hard. Don't figure that since high school's almost over, anything you do isn't worth it anymore. Just work super hard senior year and even harder in college and you'll be able to do something good.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Hope that helps!|`|FnDz57xRaa	a couple of suggestions.  finish school strong.  i imagine a community school or culinary institute will accept you, especially if you are paying cash up front and do not need student loans.  type in full sentences, and not fragments and people will actually take you seriously.  if you don't want to be on welfare, don't allow yourself to fail.  if you don't get accepted at first, keep trying.  if you live in a city, you will have more possibilities.  <br>  <br>  i imagine grades aren't that important to a culinary school.  these schools are separate from academic institutions.|`|vw4KXRlLaa	While it's wonderful that you want to make something of yourself and have that kind of confidence, there are more than a lot of mispellings in that, it's just completely awful spelling-wise, gramatically, etc.  Believe it or not the way that you write every day, even on the internet when you chat, etc, will effect your skills in the English language.  If you can't even be bothered to spell the worlds "from" and "for" then there's probably part of the reason that you've got a 1.1 GPA right there, you need to put some more effort into it.<br>  <br>  Now that aside, you need to look at your life and ask, why am I getting bad grades?  Is it because you do poorly on tests?  Is it because you don't do the homework?  Is it because you don't go to class?  Usually it is one or more of these things, all of which can be resolved with some effort.  <br>  <br>  The first step is to pinpoint where the problem is, and the next is it solve it.  Ask for help from your parents, your teachers, your counselor, they're all excellent resources, and they'll be even more helpful if you show you've already put in some effort to identify what your weaknesses are, then they can better help you down the road to solve them.<br>  <br>  Good luck, if you do really believe in yourself and want to succeed, then you've already got a great chance of doing it with some time and effort.|`|Zq5EzjGeaa	1. Try your best to finish off your junior year with the best grades possible. a 1.1 GPA is very low and wont get you anywhere.<br>  2. Get a part time job. 30000 will last you but not for long<br>  3.

bjqjkDMHaa	It does not give you arthritis, however, you do need to be kind of gentle with your neck, there's a lot of nerves and things in it that are very sensitive.  Besides, cracking your neck a lot (I know because I have Tourette's, it makes me crack my joints and stuff)  or shaking your head too much will in the short term give you a nasty headache.  When you crack a joint, you pop bubbles of gas that have built up in the fluid surrounding the bones.  You can wear out the padding of cartilege around joints, but that tends to happen much later in life, after decades and decades of repeated movements.  Say, if you spend all day long every day doing nothing but joint-cracking...in a few decades, it would catch up with you.  But unless you have a really bad tic like the tics in Tourette's, you shouldn't be doing it that often.  It's just that the sound really bugs the crap out of some people.  Also, if you do it really hard, you can stretch out your tendons/ligaments which hold your bones and joints together, but it would signal you if you were hurting yourself by hurting like all get out, so as long as it doesn't hurt to do it, you're okay.|`|bQ4RAi07aa	reptitive cracking of knuckles and back, neck can cause arthritic and or spurs of your bones this theory was researched on numerous patients who cracked their joints for years.and found this to be true in almost all patients.|`|IscyUxTJaa	you can get artrites  in those areas|`|KsJBKRmxaa	It is just an old wives tale.. thats all.
bvvxNVY7aa	Doctors are not allowed to tell your personal health information to anyone, including your parents. They passed a new law called HIPPA that is the Health Information Privacy Protection Act that prohibits health care workers from disclosing any information about patients. Even before this law was passed, doctors have been bound by confidentiality.
bQ4RAi07aa	Popping or cracking knuckles is a result of releasing gas out of a pocket of liquid in your joints (if I remember correctly). Basically, it's kind of like opening a can of soda. It isn't harmful and contrary to popular opinion doesn't cause arthritis (unless you are predisposed to it). <br>  <br>  Knees, on the other hand, usually pop because of ligaments snapping over bony protrusions. This again is harmless unless you're really twisting your kness. <br>  <br>  Why it would happen "all the time" depends on how often you're talking about, but my knees crack and pop at least 5 - 10 times a day, and it's considered normal for me|`|RTZW9Gl0aa	My knees crack alot too.

AA11315360	You may have a serious overdrive of hormones. I would talk to a doctor. If you have a BF just have more sex. If you dont then I would suggest getting one soon.<br>  Personally I do not masturbate ever. I rather it be a connection with a guy (yeah im a total girl lol). I want it to be an emotional connection in a way with a guy. <br>  I get horny too but I just have sex with my BF. I wouldnt worry too much. If you dont have a BF all this means is that you need to get one to have lots of sex. <br>  <br>  It is a sex addiction only if this masturbation problem is causing you to have problems functioning in regular life (like you have to do it at work or you arent going out anywhere because you want to stay home to do it again). Then you need to see a counselor.

Yes, it can. If a mother smokes marijuana while she is pregnant, the baby can be born with deformities or medical problems, like with any other substance. If you're older, the effects are not nearly as serious as if you were around pot when you were a child (simply because you're mainly done growing after age 15 or so, if you're female).<br>  <br>  2. It depends. The drug that gets you high is called THC. There are different levels in different kinds of weed. The more THC, the more likely you are to stay higher longer. There is question to tolerance, meaning if you smoke weed every day, you don't become as high as you did when you first started smoking it. But if you've never smoked weed before (and you smoke it correctly), you'll probably get incredibly high. But most of the time, newbs don't do it correctly and don't get high.<br>  <br>  3. Time is the only way. It's like being drunk - you can't sober up with coffee or a cold shower. Normally, being high only lasts a few hours.<br>  <br>  4. This is an argued topic, but most conclusions lead to marijuana being non-addictive, substance-wise. People can use marijuana for years and decide to quit one day. However, people can become mentally addicted to it, like any other drug. I believe it depends more on your personality (if you have an addictive personality, you're likely to become addicted to things easier...duh).<br>  <br>  5. It is possible. This is called a contact high. The room has to be small and smokey with little ventilation. So if you're smelling the weed very strongly and all around you, you will most likely receive this contact high. Most likely though, your high won't be as strong as the people that smoked it.<br>  <br>  6. It can be different for everyone each time. A general idea includes feelings of euphoria, extreme laughter, sensitivity to touch, and hunger (a.k.a. the munchies). Sometimes people can become paranoid or sleepy. Other times people can become very inquisitive and insightful. Weed can also be used to provoke sexual arousal. High feelings can depend on mood, type of weed, and how much of it is smoked correctly.<br>  <br>  You're coming off as young because you don't know the answers to these simple questions. My advice to you is if you're under the age of sixteen, I don't recommend smoking weed regularly. If you do try it, be careful and be in a comfortable setting with friends you trust.
dHg78Phdaa	Go for it. whoever told you it wasent fun, was either lying or they didn't enjoy it. Everyone reacts differently to this substance. Make sure you have someone you trust watch you and keep you from running away. The trip is fun. great hallucinations. Doesn't last long.

5Co6baBmaa	im in the military so i know back pain all to well im only 20 but ive thrown my back out 2 times in the past year because of it. the back is not something you want to neglect you never know what it can be so im not going to tell you what it could be because i don't know but from experience GO SEE A DOCTOR|`|0680dc154942d1ba159c72f1967ea1f7aa	the problem with back pain is that it takes awhile for it to get better because you are constantly using it.  seeing your doc is a good idea.  chiropractors are also an option. for immediate relief, i suggest icing and an over the counter pain med.

There is some regrowth sure but at least there's not red bumps and all swollen-ness... it's best to let it grow back until it's not prickly any more and then shave it all off so it's smooth again. You can probably time it so that you do it on a Friday and then won't need to until the next weekend. Believe me... no big deal from our perspective.

7gcdOCbtaa	This is a question for you to ask your Dr. HE/SHE WILL ANSWER THIS HONESTLY.<br>  <br>  !.All you can do is continue getting them burnt off(OUCH!!).<br>  <br>  2. They will always re-appear however for guys it's fewer times then women.<br>  <br>  3.Again, very good chance to continue showing up not as much as women though.<br>  <br>  4.Your immune system means nothing on this.You will always have this for the rest of you life.Even without showing your partners can still get them.<br>  <br>  5. BE A MAN and use protection at all times.Even during oral sex.Tell your partner before and always insist doing the responsible thing .You can be sued for this.A man in CA. was sued from a woman because he failed to tell her he had had herpes.She won 7 million dollars.<br>  <br>  BE WARNED!!!!!!|`|jJwuMTSqaa	You need to talk with a doctor.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	i would think they would come back askt he doctor for sure. its sounding horribel but i am not too sure butif they come bakc i would yell.|`|Bv3Dm11paa	Genital warts is a form of herpes which isa virus in your blood stream, so yes there is a very good chance they will re-appear.

And they can appear months after contact with the source. So don't just assume it was the "slutty chick". Either way if you're still in contact or have had other sexual partners you should let them know they are at risk too.<br>  ..... and it isn't only the genital region that gets warts from the HPV either, oral sex passes them on too.|`|421b2fb60081b51b56d2f694ad49b8ceaa	The chances of the warts re-appearing is almost none.

AA11375099	I am sorry about your husband's cancer, it is difficult to see a loved one go through it.<br>  <br>  I think it would just be so nice to have his friends around.  My wife sees her friends a lot and it makes a big difference in her outlook I know she is happy whenever they call on the phone or stop by to say hello.  <br>  <br>  And then she meets with all of them once a month for BUNKO and they have a great time together.  Let them take their cues from your husband and they will have a great time.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the best!|`|k5X78IM3aa	Your husband's friends know how serious cancer is & what it can do to the human body.  They should be prepared for that.  Your husband should just be himself & enjoy the visit from his friends.  They want to support & encourage him.  It should turn out fine.<br>  <br>  I am a cancer survivor.  Going through chemo can be tough.  Hopefully, he too will be a survivor.  Do not give up on him & do not give up on yourself.  Give him my best.  You haven't asked me too so I hope you will not mind if I keep him & you in my prayers.  May God bless you all.  With love, Nala|`|HumMEMu5aa	As a cancer patient I can tell you visits from friends are very cheering and supportive.

It might be a shock at first but they will see the old friend in there after talking to him. <br>  Tell them not to worry on how to behave, they will find the person that is within. You'll husband might feel uncomfortable at first as they will, but let them reminisce about the past and their friendships. <br>  And if your husband is worried about being weak or bald or..so what,  this wil be good for the soul.<br>  I wish you all the best.|`|i7oKJRf1aa	I'm sorry that you and your husband are going through this. They should just act normally. When people are sick, they don't want to be treated like they are sick. I hope your husband does well... He's in my thoughts.|`|cXXJVz64aa	Ask your husband if he will feel comfortable seeing them. If he OKs it, tell the truth to the buddies so they know what to expect.
YM03OVi8aa	Is this pre, current, or post cancer. If this is post cancer and ur husband went through chemo the infection will most likly be handled by the doctors, they will watch his fever, as after chemo the red,white blood cell count is drastically low, and also the platelegs are low to which help with the clotting of the blood. After chemo the immune system is severally depressed. If this is pre chemo, then the infection should be alot easier to fight as the system is good, and the doctors are handling it. If it is current chemo then the same as post but the infection will interfer with his chemo treatment... which isn't very good when fighting cancer. <br>  <br>  Try to avoid the conversation about death, unless your husband thinks that your family is ready for it. Otherwise do not discuss it, think optomisticly, mention things that you guys will do together after he gets all better. Share some stories some laugh, laughter is the best medicine :)|`|0C7iyfvyaa	one important thing, don't think it is the end. There is still hope and you can try Shaung Hor Lingzhi for 1weeks.

As a result an accurate prediction of the disease is possible.<br>  <br>  The researchers were able to discover the effect of a molecular off switch known as Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK) 3 beta. When the GSK becomes faulty, it fails in its function to turn off beta catenin. Beta cantenin enables the development of pre-leukemia stem cells into leukemia stem cells. It also helps to and expands their numbers. This leads Chronic Myeloid Leukemia to a blast crisis stage.<br>  <br>  So perhaps your friends can be treated completely. <br>  <br>  For more info you may visit:|`|158c92b1d7f6200775a9174dadcccd19aa	First of all it's not easy to talk about the survival rate, since science and medicine are improving, new drugs and protocols are made, and every case has its own characteristics. Secondly, searching for the survival rate is not going to help the patient or the family and friends of her. What she needs most is good medical centers, love and prayers.|`|YHM73chTaa	Your friend is high risk. But even high risk ALL patients do very well 70-80% have no relapses. Those that have relapses the chances of survival depend on how long since diagnosis. The further the better the odds of survival.

However, it is not good depending on the type of shoes you wear, if you do not wear flat shoes, with a flat base, then your going to end up screwing ur ankles up, along with ur knees. Ankle Weights are good, given that they are used correctly, have fun and happy lifting :)
Np0Y3vUCaa	Antihistamines shouldn't effect your voice directly. They do have the tendency to dry out the mucosa of the larynx and pharynx. If you notice your voice is a little more harsh because of dryness, and if you have dry mouth try staying hydrated. Drinking more fluids may help or sucking on hard candies.

There are people who do this kind of service for you, all you need is to pay. Then you will have a very long time free from the disturbing hair, but they will grow back again. So I say, don't do anything, let them be.|`|2Zpf6EUwaa	Please don't do that, it's not hot.|`|vw4KXRlLaa	Regardless of what people say, the decision to shave your public hair should be for yourself, if it's what you want to do, then more power to you.  Also, there are plenty of women who prefer it trimmed (usually not totally bare, but they certainly don't love the jungle), so that's always a plus.<br>  <br>  Some tips for your problem.  Number one thing is it shave WITH the grain, NOT against it, this will irritate the skin immensely and cause those bumps that hurt so bad.  Also, number 1.5 (because it's almost as important as one), is to make sure you use a FRESH blade.  Dull blades will also cause the bumps and make the shaving in general less pleasant.<br>  <br>  As far as the hair growing back fast, there isn't a lot you can do, it's just you body's natural hair growth rate.  Waxing will slow it down, but it also more painful and less practical.<br>  <br>  Other things you can do to help with irritation is to use shaving cream when you shave instead of just water, and even get some lotion to rub on there after you finish shaving to help lessen the skin's irritation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SA5DeRpUaa	don't shave your pubes , you'll look like a naked mole rat , your a guy accept what come naturally but keep it reason.|`|Zq5EzjGeaa	YOU DONT|`|waBq57jcaa	Just trim it with a scissor that it.

More likely is the possibility that you are having a regression in your correction.  This means that your eyes have started to return somewhat toward your original prescription.  Having a relatively small amount of prescription could cause these symptoms and would indeed be more noticeable at night when your pupils are dilated mored.  You need to go back in to your doc and let him look.

FicyC2TXaa	Jilldays, a quick glance at your Q&A suggests to me that you're young, possibly school age - forgive me if I'm wrong.<br>  <br>  I don't know why you're asking this question, but you need to know that the chances of breast cancer in a teenager are close to zero. It's mainly a disease of ageing - 80% of those diagnosed are over 50 (the average age for diagnosis is 60) and only around 5% are under 40.<br>  <br>  Fewer than 0.1% of all those diagnosed with breast cancer are under 30, and it's almost unheard of in under 20s.<br>  <br>  The American Cancer Society and other cancer organisations recommend that women begin breast self-examination at the age of 20.<br>  <br>  <br>  At the age I'm assuming you are,  your breasts are still growing and developing; every day on this board there are questions from teenage girls who are terrified they have breast cancer because of perfectly normal hormonal changes.<br>  <br>  Of course it may be that you are asking on behalf of someone older; early breast cancer usually has no symptoms at all. Symptoms of possible breast cancer are:<br>  <br>  change in size - one breast may have become noticeably larger or lower<br>  <br>  nipple change - if it becomes inverted (pulled in) or changes its position or shape<br>  <br>  rash - on or around the nipple<br>  <br>  discharge - from one or both nipples<br>  <br>  puckering or dimpling - around nipple<br>  <br>  swelling – in your armpit or around your collarbone (from lymph nodes)<br>  <br>  lump or thickening - that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue - BUT remember that most breast lumps are not cancerous<br>  <br>  These are changes that an adult woman should be looking out for and reporting. In a teenager any changes to the breast are almost certainly hormonal|`|gkSLVk4Faa	Breast cancer Symptoms may be:<br>  <br>  1. Feel a thickening in the nipple or in the underarm area<br>  2. Feel a tenderness in the nipple<br>  3. Unusual change in skin( like reddish)<br>  4. Fluid discharge from nipple<br>  5. Change in size or shape<br>  6.

Is about learning healthy lifestyles to loose the weight and keep it off.  I lost 32 pounds in 7 months. It is worth it.  The food...... There is no "food" you eat your own food and count points for it.|`|u5cwRJ0Paa	With Weight Watchers (depending on what country you live in) they have a couple of different eating plans that you can choose from.  In Australia and New Zealand you can either choose the Points or the Satisfaction plan.  Points means that every food has a point value and based on your situation you have a daily total of points that you are allowed each day, so you keep track of what you eat and don't go over your point allowance.  On the Satisfaction plan you don't have to keep track of what you eat, but you are only allowed foods from a list that Weight watchers gives you, and you only eat when you are actually hungry. <br>  <br>   <br>  You actually get alot of freedom with Weight Watchers whichever plan you choose.<br>  The $17 that you pay is your meeting fee.  Once a week you go along to a meeting where you can meet and talk with other weight watchers, you get weighed so you can see how much weight you lost over a week, you get it recorded so its good motivation, you have a leader who gives you a new booklet which has motivational tips and recipes in it, and you get good inspiration from the other weight watchers.<br>  Weight watchers teaches you about changing your attitude to food, making the right choices, incorporating excercise into your life, and how to keep weight off for life.<br>  The food is good, its just normal food.<br>  If you do not eat a very balanced diet at the moment you can expect to lose 6 to 12 kilos in 3 months, even more if you do more exercise.|`|dm0h6Uppaa	The only way I lost my weight is to intake only only fruits and salad for the whole month and you will figure your way to lose weight|`|wXKs94nDaa	I lost about 15 lbs in 2 months......then i slacked off but did not gain the weight back (i slack for a day then eat healthy for 2 or so). <br>  <br>  It is the best investment of my life.
AA11490385	I think it depends on the person.  My grandma is 85 years old, smokes like a chimney, and has for the past 70 years.  She is totally FINE (which seems crazy to me given all of that).  Other people drink heavily their whole lives with no problems either.  Then there are those who die from that kind of stuff.

Only a strep test can tell.|`|sobrGyNYaa	Sounds like a classic case of Strep to me. I've had Strep a lot - my dad's a doctor, and we always know when it's Strep or something else. Strep hits you really fast - within just a few hours you go from feeling almost normal to feeling incredibly sick. Sore throats are worse with Strep because it's a bacterial infection and requires antibiotics to get rid of it. I always get the other symptoms you mentioned as well. Go see a doc and get the antibiotics you need. Once you start taking them, they'll knock out your sore throat within a day or so. But keep taking them for the prescribed period, because if you don't, the Strep will come back within a week or two and be even worse.|`|Qihdy4Fnaa	Strep throat unless you are younger than 12 years old, then I would vote for tonsillitis.

6YnwXCIaaa	Unless you have a previous relationship with a particular specialist (and usually, have also been seen within the past year), you need a family doctor's referral to any specialist.  You can also be referred by emergency doctors or walk in clinic doctors.  In all cases, the referral will only be made if the referring doctor thinks it's necessary.|`|WRoZ2Ht4aa	no it all depends on what type of insurance you have,call your insurance company and they will be able to help you find a specialist that your insurance will cover.|`|AA11490385	Here in the U.S, it depends on your insurance.  For instance, I can refer myself to a specialist, but some insurance companies do not work that way.  I am guessing since there in Canada you have a national healthcare system (which we need here!!!) that you cannot self refer but need your general practitioner to do that for you.

3ff667c128961780de9ba7ad29fa70faaa	If I were you I would go to the doctor or it its late the emergency room you i keep experiencing pain. Since you did have a heart murmur it's probably best to go get checked out. Maybe the pain could be related to your past heart murmur or it could be something called costochondritis. This is when your ribs become inflamed and cause pains in your chest, mostly on the left side. I was just diagnosed with this. And you said that you feel it when you laugh, breathe, or do nothing. That's when I feel mine. ANd there are many other things it could be, but I'm not a doctor so i don't know what's wrong. But if your really worried you should go to the emergency room if you pain doesn't leave since you have had past heart problems. It's best to be safe than sorry. You're just gonna have to make time and try to go to the doctor because your health comes first.|`|cc9affbe946bb3e49b15b2ea982e4a8caa	Go to the emergency room asap!

b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	Rituximab is an intravenous drug that is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It belongs to a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies. Other monoclonal antibodies include trastuzumab (Herceptin) and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg). <br>  <br>  Tumor cells (like most normal cells) have receptors on their surfaces. Molecules on the outside of the cell can attach to these receptors. When they do, they can cause changes to occur within the cells. One receptor, present in more than 90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, is called CD20. Molecules that attach to CD20 can affect the growth and development of the tumor cells and, sometimes, the production of new tumor cells. Rituximab is a man-made antibody that was developed using cloning and recombinant DNA technology from human and murine (mice or rat) genes. Rituximab is thought to attach to the CD20 receptor and cause the tumor cells to disintegrate (lyse). In some non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, it also prevents the production of more tumor cells. Rituximab was approved by the FDA in 1997. <br>  <br>  In the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, rituximab is used when other biologic medications (TNF-blockers, such as infliximab, etanercept, or adalimumab) have failed to be effective. The effectiveness of rituximab is a result of its temporarily depleting the number of the B-cells, cells of the immune system which are important in promoting inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.

The good thing is with his build, is when he gets muscle, he'll have an athletic build, he may not be as powerful as others, but he will be a lot healthier and quicker than the meat heads.  A weak build translates into  good build after puberty.  Just be patient.  <br>  <br>  And don't forget that when he's 20 he'll have the chicks all over him.

I'm happy with how I am.  I have good friends, I'm friends with a girl I'm in love with (she's taken, sadly), people like me, and I'm a nice and respectful dude, and I'm still making it good in life even as I'm fighting depression.  If I can do it, then so can your brother.  He's only 12, and he shouldn't be beating himself up over this.  Besides, it's the inside that's the most important.

Join a soccer league, or baseball, hockey...anything that will help his body produce testosterone for muscle growth when he hits puberty full on. Eat more veggies and fruits and the weight will pack on pretty soon.You'lll see by the end of the summer he will be much older looking.|`|By2mEY6Waa	i would recommend buying a weight set and have him start working out and buy him some protein shakes and have him drink them after he starts working out and have him start running it does not matter if it is on a tredmill or not but if he does run have him run every for about half to a full mile and if he does this make him drink a  milkshake before he goes to bed as this will help with muscle development but only if he works out and he will naturally build muscle in the next few years of his life because of puberty|`|chnydMqAaa	Tell him to wait till he goes through puberty.

dpgXzMenaa	Almost *all* people do, male and female alike... at least, they do if they have an orgasm - or more than one - while they're masturbating or having sex.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure.  It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation.  You will *definitely* know when you have one.  There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm.  Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee).  The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm in one or more of these ways, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  Then you'll know what one is and how to have one, for sure.<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|ZWyIvBhYaa	it is totally normal to make strange facial expressions during masturbating or actual intercourse.|`|xbedCzcraa	Yes this is normal.<br>  and yes i do, it's just because of the pleasure :]

13k2WKx8aa	The vaccination is actually not very effective at preventing the virus. That is to say, it does work well, but when compared to those people who have actually contracted the disease, it pales in comparison.<br>  <br>  You could get it at 14, feel crappy for a couple of days, and then wait a couple of weeks for the scabbing to go away. If young, it really is better to just get the damn sickness and get it over with.<br>  <br>  Complications come into play when you're in your 30's and 40's. That's when it can become a serious condition.<br>  <br>  Under 20 (some might say this is bad advice) but expose yourself to it. It's guaranteed immunity.|`|USoqyjaAaa	The vaccine is nearly 100% effective if given in two doses. If you only had one dose as a child you should get a second dose.  When people do get chickenpox after the vaccine it is usually a mild case. <br>  <br>  In answer to your question, people usually recover from the disease but before vaccination about 100 people died from chickenpox each year and many more were hospitalized for complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	If you have HIV or something, then it could be a problem.  But otherwise, it is pretty tame stuff.  Vaccine works for some people and not others.  Nothing to worry about though.  Even if you did get it, you would not die.|`|SUKdrAkGaa	if you have the vaccination you should be just fine.  its just like having the chicken pox, you are immune to the disease.|`|T6PzMyPBaa	only if you're very old i think|`|flKkoiwbaa	If you've been vaccinated, it's highly unlikely that you will get chicken pox.<br>  <br>  Yes, chicken pox can be fatal, but it's extremely rare.  Chicken pox can cause pneumonia or encephalitis, which can be fatal in the very young, the very old, or those whose immune systems are compromised.|`|3E7FT4yDaa	Do not go out of your  way to avoid them at your age.  Get them and get it over with.  They were not fun at 24, but the sweetheart ``nurse nancy`` who visited made the time memorable!|`|1vCoaf08aa	Yeah, but, it's extremely rare and really only happens in cases of babies and toddlers.<br>  <br>  If you haven't had them, don't worry, you may never get them.
1WNOQXVlaa	Yeah youre teeth are moving, so its ok, sometimes they hurt and you feel like theyre being pulled out, but theyre really just moving a little|`|UZHMxvHWaa	no, the brackets are not supposed to be wiggly or loose, that means they were put on wrong, BUT your teeth might feel wiggly because they're moving.
tQO9LW8Qaa	Yes, it's very common, but you should see your doctor and have your Iron level tested. It's possible you might need to take a supplement.|`|qVNSMkYlaa	nope
156d702b8908052bd0660d07c6803996aa	I was on Paxil and it didn't work well with me either. You should get back into the doctor and let him know about your symptoms. I don't know if you could get withdrawal problems from it in that short period of time?|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	How can you have a brain tumor?Maybe you have brain damage/amnesia/in a coma?|`|iybezfi6aa	If you are not getting off of it, you should. Try coming down off it slowly, although you will still have the withdrawal symptoms.<br>  Paxil (and the other drugs like it such as Zoloft, Prozac, etc.) is not for everyone. You are definitely one of those people.|`|ad9AssJZaa	Yes that is withdrawal, especially the brain zaps, though I find it surprising and alarming that this would happen to you after only having been on it three weeks. You should come off paxil by slowly tapering off it to avoid that crap. That sucks, go to your doctor.|`|PE4n3mrmaa	GO IN TO THE DOCTOR!!! I had two EXTREMELY bad reactions to antidepressants and had two+ weeks of hell coming off of Effexor with withdrawal symptoms... you need to see what your doctor has to say.|`|pqVWrNFtaa	I'd go see a doctor asap so they can help you.

AA10929751	the best is simply to eat right and exercise. you won't lose a bunch of weight right away, and you might never get to what you think a 'perfect' weight is. but you'll be healthy and have YOUR body, not someone else's.|`|z9nCUpaOaa	Check out the free workout videos at ..<a href="http://www.FatX101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.FatX101.com</a>
5lYOOeyeaa	I would say call your doctor's office and ask. You could also check out a teen health book. I think the teenage body book has a chart for height and weight expectations. Remember, you're great no matter what.
F2kRe3Ptaa	bounce on balloons while masturbating it's really cool and playing with the knot of your balloon on your clit|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I think you need to give it a break. Too much of anything is not a good think. Try changing some things to get into. Watch a different porn or, just, maybe, have phone sex with her?|`|bo4MguzVaa	Read a good book, I mean a fun book-not a school book.  Its relaxing and entertaining.  Kinda takes you out of your life for a little bit.
6759956326e2164e86ae2e187913a3cdaa	well it sounds like you have just about everyone medically looking after you to manage your condition and your pain, sounds to me like you might need some sort of therapy though to help with your suicidal thoughts.
cXXJVz64aa	The older, the worse the chances. It depends on the type of leukemia, the age you get it, and how far it's progressed. Only a specialist can give you those answers. Remember that most Leukemias are now curable.
833a435e36344342d10e69454b7e6731aa	that's really good! since you're kind of light, keep eating. just make sure you get a balanced diet. since summer is coming.. you could be getting ready for a growth spurt!! (most of my friends get them over the summer)|`|9dQAwNupaa	Thats awesome.<br>  It means you are growing.<br>  I remember when I was about 13 ,<br>  it happened to me. I grew like crazy that summer<br>  :)
XRdOfOn6aa	If your bone plates have fused, you can gain no more height.<br>  <br>  Since you are saying you have no facial hair, you should see an endocrinologist and get tested for hormones that may be lacking. If your growth plates have not fused, and you are growth hormone deficient, you may qualify for that medication after a stimulation test. <br>  <br>  As for over the counter supplements, just a healthy diet and make sure you are not deficient in any vitamins. But nothing will make you gain height.
6YnwXCIaaa	It depends on the particular kidney disease and any other diseases you might have otherwise e.g. diabetes.  Some cystic kidney diseases run in families.|`|hmsMpECkaa	You have more of your mother than your father.  No need to go get tested.|`|cXXJVz64aa	It's possible you may have it, but doesn't mean you will. My Grandmother died in her 30's from kidney disease. Her kids and grandkids never got it. Also, medicine has changed so much lately that most people don't die from it.|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	Just because your father has something doesn't mean you do, but I know that doesn't stop anyone from freaking out about it. Some things are hereditary, and I don't know if kidney disease is, but think of it this way: At least you can get a kidney transplant if your kidneys fail. Imagine if you had inherited something worse... like brain cancer.
TcRR8n9vaa	To be perfectly honest, diet pills are a waste of money. They say you'll lose weight but chances are, you probablyy won't. And a lot of them can cause anal leakage & who wants that? Plus, with some people - pills have the opposite effect because people think they're doing great because they take the pills but then eat more cause they think they're safe & it ends up screwing them over. Stick with the exercise. Eat healthy. Try one of those dance workout videos - they're fun & with some of them - you don't even realise you're 'working out' until the next morning when you feel it in your body. That's what works. You have to work hard to lose weight - not just pop a pill & a few months later - have the body of a swimsuit model. Just keep working at it & when you see results - you'll be so happy with yourself that it'll push you to keep going. Good luck!! =)|`|l1iBbNGzaa	NO THEY DO NOT..PLEASE GIVE ME A BEST ANSWER|`|Y3HWASvPaa	Actually, you don't need to diet in fact if you want to lose weight, the sole method which definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials in stock, it has been featured in Fox News and CNN. I shed twenty five pounds, it definitely does produce results!
7kaHDPnRaa	Dry skin is probably the problem. I'm a swimmer and I swim A LOT! and the chorine gives my dry dry skin, so whenever im in the water to much or i sweat from running (swimmers run too!), then my skin will burn too.<br>  Its just dry skin. <br>  Apply LOTS OF LOTION every day,<br>  and not just on your face.<br>  Also, take a shower every time it happens.<br>  hope i helped :D good luck!|`|dm0h6Uppaa	Before exercise I usually use lipo 6 capsule that keep your muscles smooth and give you energy in exercise and in daliy routine|`|Swmd0P2uaa	I tried washing my clothes with a different detergent and it may be too soon to tell but I think it helped. Why dont you try different pants or washing them with something differently? Think, do you get that anywhere on your upper torso? Maybe its the pants! <br>  <br>  Here are a few possibilities of what it could be the website is about.com <a href="http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/tipsandtricks/a/itching.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/tipsa...</a>|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	put some deordant up the side of your tight like half way from your knee and almost up to your crotch, the inside of your thighs. a dry stick
cXXJVz64aa	If you are right-handed, you are probably using more force with that hand, when shaving.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	Hey bro go to a pharmacy and pick up a tube of hydro cortisone cream rub it it twice a day for a week if it it is not better by then then i promise it has nothing to do with shaving ...but i think it will clear it up ..|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Maybe it is just ingrown hair from shaving.
DgX1kbl0aa	I'm sure a few boxes of Twinkies and a couple pounds of burgers will make it bigger :)|`|K5BLCZPkaa	Run a lot. That will help, but it probably won't make like a massive difference, but it will make it a little bigger :]|`|wSqq4gSBaa	work out or squeeze your booty cheeks 2gether  i've heard of booty pills|`|bo4MguzVaa	I have heard of excersizes to shrink and tone...but I never heard anyone want to make it bigger.  I guess it would be cool to have a big, firm booty...not a flabby booty.  <br>  <br>  My booty is big, but its flabby  :(.  Stair climber and squats is what my cure is, but I dont feel up to it since im preggo.
NvPD6VBoaa	I also had colon cancer and they removed part of my colon.  They told me, if they had to remove the whole large intestine that they could create a new colon by connecting the small intestine to the rectum and not have to have the colostomy bag.  If she had cancer of the rectum  they would not be able to do that.  Have her ask her surgeon.  I was lucky and didn't need one.|`|7b3db77a1944e0a68e0b592b14182a14aa	Sorry to  tell you she will to get use to it I am in the same boat I have a colostomy it can make you miserable she should be thankful to be alive and not to have cancer any more which is not my case it has spread to my lungs.  I spend some of my time answering questions on colon cancer.  I know how you feel when I first had the surgery they told me it would be reverse able due to problems they took whole colon out.  Now I must live with it and get use to it.|`|UfBIhYwPaa	I have heard of no such thing, but living with the stoma does get easier. I was 20 when I had the surgery for colon cancer and a stoma was created. Needless to say, it was the most disgusting thing I had seen, and I couldn't even look at it for weeks. I felt ugly and disfigured. But once I started to look after it myself I accepted that I had to have one, and a few months later I was used to it. It became an everyday thing, and very easy to look after, and I regained my confidence. Some people argue that being young made it easier. That's not true at all. I was the most squeamish person!!<br>  <br>  Of course, being as confident as before is unlikely, but I'm not miserable over it, and don't hate my body. <br>  <br>  My point is that one gets used to it. It may be very difficult to see that now, but there will be a time when you don't even realise it's not normal. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|OURb1rnTaa	ask her surgeon, and i said a prayer for her comfort and recovery
YFx8N0wjaa	get a note saying excusing you from running the whole thing<br>  have the doctor say that if you need to walk you must <br>  but don't have him or her excusing you from running period
c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	The proper treatment of hyperthyroidism is not to take medications such as methimazole but rather to 'ablate' the gland by swallowing a capsule of I131 or I123.  If your thyroid function is high despite treatment this will certainly elevate your blood pressure.  Blood pressure varies considerably during the day - based upon more than 200 ambulatory blood pressure studies - it has been consistently demonstrated that your blood pressure from the lowest to the highest reading may vary by as much as 50/25 mm Hg.  The Omron unit has generally received good reviews BUT there are no studies comparing the accuracy of a wrist blood pressure reading to that of a reading taken on the upper arm.  At age 17 a blood pressure of 160/090 mm Hg would indeed be high - 95th percentile - meaning 2 standard deviations above the mean.  Even taking into account the variance in blood pressure during the day you state that your lowest reading is 144/085 mm Hg which would still be 'high' for a 17 year old.  You need your blood pressure taken by someone who knows the proper technique and has a unit that is placed on the upper arm.  The most accurate and reproducible readings are those taken first thing in the morning.  If you take readings in this fashion please email them to me at johnerussomd@jhu.edu and I will try to be of further assistance to you.  I wish you the very best of health and may God Bless.|`|AA12266052	You have got Stage 1 Hypertension.<br>  Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (≥ 140 mm Hg), diastolic BP (≥ 90 mm Hg), or both. Hypertension with no known cause (primary; formerly, essential hypertension) is most common. Hypertension with an identified cause (secondary hypertension) is usually due to a renal disorder. Usually, no symptoms develop unless hypertension is severe or long-standing. Diagnosis is by sphygmomanometry. Tests may be done to determine cause, assess damage, and identify other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and drugs, including diuretics, β - blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and Ca channel blockers.<br>  Hyperthyroidism can cause secondary hypertension.<br>  Check the functions of the kidney, heart and retina periodically.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	have your dad note the bp for 2 weeks and follow up with his doctor.

F08HDRvraa	Sometimes when you have a cold or sinus infection, your sinus can drain and cause a really nasty taste in your mouth or smell.  You might actually buy some saline nasal mist to rinse out your sinuses.  Also be sure to brush your tongue as well as your teeth,|`|exmBwX51aa	If it's metallic or peppery-tasting, you might have eaten some bad food.  Try brushing your tongue lightly.

Is it your first period? Because if so, then it could be perfectly normal. It takes time for your body to adjust.

kowMNYPsaa	it could just be from all the stress from thinking you could be pregnant. The only way to be sure is to buy a pregnancy test ( i would suggest buying a two pack to make sure that it was right) The same thing happened my friend and it turned out to be a pregnancy scare (the missed periods, the having to go to the bathroom often, and the nauseating feeling) Just try and be more careful and get some birth control|`|9FCtWW1baa	Why don't you go see a doctor or buy a pregnancy test from a local drug store.|`|r8Ulgpvaaa	you might just have a yeast infection...id go to a doctor or get one of those at home test kit things. but doctors are always better. good luck!

36a096122b11f05ab37300054a75ddfaaa	First off, breathe!<br>  <br>  I am constantly in stressful enviornments and situations and sometimes the best thing to do is to take a few deep breaths.<br>  <br>  Also, Try to relax. when things pile up, look at the things that NEED to be done and do those things first. If a smaller detail comes up that fits into your schedule, go for it, but if it's too stressful, make time for it later. Priorities first. Period. Don't overwhelm yourself with small stuff.<br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up. Most of the people who are constantly stressed are overly critical of themselves. Everyone makes mistakes. Instead of getting upset with yourself for messing up, praise yourself for at least trying and then give it your best shot the next time. Optomism is key in stressful situations.<br>  <br>  Take a break every now and then. A busy schedule and a stressful lifestyle can definitely limit your time, but you can almost always make time for a break. A break can be anything from going on a week long vacation to taking an extra 20 minutes in the bathtub with some soothing music and a mountain of bubbles. Even going to bed an hour earlier is a treat for me.<br>  <br>  While relaxing or while trying to get to sleep, watching the clock is a NO. You absolutely cannot relax if you're constantly glancing at the clock and dreading having to get back to work and the same if you're trying to get to sleep while staring at the clock and worrying about how hard it will be to wake up in the morning and how you will perform the following day. Set a timer and clear your mind when you give yourself some 'me time'. Think about the things that make you happy, and if you have the time, DO the things that make you happy.<br>  <br>  Other than that, remember to eat properly and drink lots of water and juices (you'd be suprised at how well your body responds to stress when it's in good nutrition!), exercise, set up regular sleeping hours (try not to pull too many all-nighters unless absolutely necessary) and smile often! Smiling often helps me feel better about a situation even if I'm stressed or upset about it. <br>  <br>  Make sure you laugh too! =]<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Remember to take time to yourself each day. Do something fun, exercise, have a bubble bath or a massage, laugh, and practice positive thinking or learn to meditate.

Just think to yourself,"stop". If you have a lot of accumulated things, make a plan(or to do list), take a day at a time. Meditate for as long as you can(from a few minutes to an hour). Close your eyes, think of nothing, or an object, comforting place, or word)(with practice,it'll be much easier).Take a walk, talk to someone who's willing to listen, exercise, take an early hour to sleep. Do things on time. Figure out what is really stressing you out, and if it can be eliminated. I use the release technique.It's amazing, if only I had time always to do it. Ok, here it goes. Think of the things that overwhelm you(one at a time). When you have that thought, be aware of that clutching feeling in your stomach. When you find it, pretend that there's a window there(or just an imaginary tube or opening), and while you breathe, imagine that the energy(that clutching feeling) is passing right through you.(In the stomach area). Other good things you may try is doing yoga, laugh(for instance, watch videos, or joke books). Remember, stress is the #1 silent killer.(I hope that knowledge didn't stress you).|`|h7uxxiZZaa	go to a therapist , and talk about your problems

Az87btqBaa	It will most likely be out of his system by then if he only smoked once. I've passed in less time than that, but weight really matters and Im very skinny. Tell him to exercise when possible, eat low fat foods, and drink lots of cranberry juice. Dont exercise the last 2 days before the test.  When I say out of his system, I mean that it will not be detectable in a test, not that its technically out of his system. This confusion is why some people think you will fail a test unless you have a month to get clean, which is not true at all and shows they have never smoked or taken a test. If there's doubt tell him to get synthetic urine, you can find them at your local head shops most likely, call around. He can just go into the bathroom with the bottle and squirt it in the cup, perfectly legal. It stays at body temperature with a warmer pad. I've had 22 jobs and there's never been 2 weeks in a row in which I have not smoked, so you can imagine how many drug tests I've taken. The people who say 30 days are wrong, and I explained earlier why they are confused. I don't know how they explain all of us, people like me, who have smoked within a week of taking a test and passed. Detox drinks dont work, only for some people, because it wasnt the detox drink that made them pass, it was their own metabolism, but they give credit to the detox drink, not knowing the truth. Check the ingredients on any detox drink, its basically just colored water with creatine (creatine adds to water retention, so the people who have passed only passed because they diluted the test, which is the same as drinking lots of water and peeing out nothing but water, many labs will make you retest if this happens. Its happened to me before, called me back and made me retest,1 made me wait in the lobby until I had to go again, wouldnt let me retest another day). This is the most popular video on youtube when it comes to drug testing, and as you can see from many people's comments, the advice has worked for them. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoD_YSR46I&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoD_YSR4...</a><br>  <br>  I've taken at least 11 tests in the past 8 years.

All of the brands of blends of sexual herbs which assist performance, stamina, blood flow, premature ejaculation, creating more seminal/sexual/prostate fluids and firmness of penile erections.|`|EGvVCpIxaa	what..can't he keep up with you? haha|`|sCCjAKllaa	Keeping his body in shape through exercise regimens, and eating veggies along with other healthy foods.|`|rHqe7oMoaa	..............<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (is anyone else creeped out by this question?)|`|sxsOGoJ5aa	Tell him to leave home and get away from the man hating feminist|`|9nrJSRNTaa	creep!|`|6554jtXMaa	Basic cardiovascular exercises would do the trick...anything that will get the heart pumping<br>  <br>  Running, swimming, biking|`|39AG0S5Uaa	umm.. hes 19 he could ask this himself

And you, the Top Contributor, how the hell haven't you seen this one before?|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	Wow -- the best thing I can suggest is that you encourage him to speak to a male who can relate to him being male.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure that he is masturbating - that doesn't sound like masturbation to me.<br>  <br>  Let me note something(s) else - I doubt anyone else will -- and they need to be said.<br>  <br>  1.  I would guess (NO ONE can diagnose via net) that your son has some form of OCD (which may or may not be affecting him sexually - but will be visible elsewhere in his life) -- OCD primarily develops as a response to early childhood extremes in expectation for cleanliness and "potty training."  Usually those demands come from the mother.<br>  <br>  2.  Your PILLOWS cost $1000 ... ummm.... we both make good salaries with excellent careers, and we are firmly in the top 20% of Americans in terms of income, we have good investments and solid retirements ahead of us.  I would NEVER consider buying a pillow that cost more than $20.00 -- and right at the moment, we don't have any that cost more than $10.00.  We have friends from every imaginable class (and I do mean every one) -- and none of them would expect to sleep on $1000 pillows.  If I had a spare $1000 laying around we would either invest it, or give it to the poor.  I cannot even imagine buying $1000 pillows -- or caring about them if I did.<br>  <br>  3.  He had dried blood on himself, cuts, and is purple and you PRESUME that he was masturbating (based on no more evidence than an erection would be my bet) and are waiting to punish him for your $1000 pillows AND HAVE HIM PAY FOR THEM.<br>  <br>  Quite frankly madam, your priorities are entirely wrong.<br>  <br>  Find the boy someone to talk to who cares -- and who he is comfortable with -- online or in person.  Step back from the situation, and forget your precious pillows.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Your son is having some issues which cannot be handled by you with any kind of punishment, or any kind of counseling at home.  He must be evaluated by an appropriate psychiatrist. NOT a counselor, but a PhD at least for the evaluation.

You need to be firm and tell him to stop and he needs to develop some shame as well as respect for others. If you hear it you need to make him stop.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't do it when your bf is there than he is aware you can hear it and appears to like that. You have a sicko kid.<br>  <br>  Kids only need locks on their doors if they have something to hide.

Honestly I think he is cutting himself while he masturbates.  There is a disease, I can't remember the name if it, where a person gets a sexual thrill from releasing sexual tension as well as creating a new sensation. They balance pleasure and pain.  Long story short, he needs help.  If he doesn't it will escalate.  There is a very good chance if he doesn't get the help he needs, he will act out his sick fantasies on real women.  I'm talking sexual assault, maybe even rape.  I know no mother wants to hear this, but you need to get him help before he ends up in prison.

Dwea01UWaa	Obviously getting 2-2.5 hours of sleep a night isn't good. It's actually pretty bad for your health, because people your age need at least 7 hours of sleep each night. I would say go ahead and get as much sleep as you possibly can at all times, so that you can restore your health. You can't keep getting so little sleep, or you'll start seeing worse side effects soon. Even if you have to take a day off, do it. You'll benefit amazingly well from even just that. Don't deprive your body of the rest it needs to function and maintain its top level health. Do what you have to do to get enough sleep. It's more important than skipping a speech. Trust. Good luck with that, and have a blessed day. :]|`|YM03OVi8aa	Well, even thought u aren't experiencing any devasting effects, you are, Truly and simply, Your body has already started to crash in a way. I can guartee ur metabolism is so low right now, that it'll soon barly be able to supply you with any energy which will result in a physical crash, meaning even if you don't wanna go to sleep your body will literally shut down. It will turn itself off just so that it can filter out toxins and get the required rest that it needs. You say u have a presentation soon, when ur not fully rested, your brain only uses about the 1/3 of the maximum power it has. As when you rest, your brain is most active keeping things running trying to filt things out. I know this first hand, I take a full schedula in highschool where i wake up at around 6 get to school at 7 stay at school for educational purposes till 3, then i go to Track pratice after school till around 6, but during football season i'd stay till about 8, would be home till around 9:00, where i would have homework till about 11 and sleep the rest of the time but lately i have been exhausted i haven't been going to bed at around 11 but at 12, or 1 and i feel the devasting effects of lack of sleep first hand this week i've had about. 20hrs of sleep within 152 hrs and i had to take a day off school because i couldn't, i was to tired, and i had nothing important due or anything. Trust me sleep depervation is affecting you whether you know it or not, Hugly with ur immune system.

XUHyEUvQaa	As a former hospice chaplain, I found that there are several reasons a person may linger.  1.  There is unfinished business with members of the family or friend.  2.  Maybe the person is looking for some person to come visit such as a son, daughter, brother, sister, etc. 3,  The person is just not ready to let go.  3.  Family has not said good bye to the person and that it is okay to die or to go to heaven or other place beyond this life.  4.  God has not decided it is time.<br>  <br>  Your father can hear you right now although he probably can't respond.  Talk to him about the positive memories that you have.  A person wants to know that they have been important in this life.  What meant the most to you about your dad?  What memories do you have of him?  Share those things with him.<br>  <br>  No one can predict exact time when a person leaves this earth.  It is really out of our hands and totally up to the person and God.  He is not in pain. He is at peace. The body can endure for some time.  It is an individual thing.<br>  <br>  My prayers are with you and your family.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I know the feeling you are having.<br>  <br>  When I was 8yrs.-old(1975), my mother, younger brother, and I, went to live with my maternal grandparents.

Keep your body warm, & this means keeping your feet warm, by wearing socks. Drink some warm tea with a trace of honey in it, as it may help soothe your throat. Sucrets throat lozenges help sooth a sore throat & they are not a cough drop.  Eat a diet of soft foods in the meantime. (eggs, mashed potatoes, pudding, Jello, bread, etc)  As for your sore throat, you need to let your doctor check it out, as you may have strep throat & will need antibiotics. As for the cold towels, they will only make matters worse & tell your g/f I said so.

Jjw4Ma9Iaa	It wasn’t until doctors took a closer look at an MRI that they discovered something very disturbing.<br>  <br>  “Once we saw the MRI we realized this is something not good,” neurosurgeon, Dr. Peter Nakaji told the news station. “It's something down in her brain stem which is as deep in the brain as you can be.”<br>  <br>  Alvarez was wheeled into surgery where Nakaji and his colleagues were expecting to remove a tumor, but they uncovered a worm instead.<br>  <br>  On a video of the surgery, Nakaji can be heard chuckling after he made the discovery.<br>  <br>  “I'm sure this is a very strange response for the people in the operating room,” he told MyFOXPhoenix.com. “But because I was so pleased to know that it wasn't going to be something terrible.”<br>  <br>  Doctors removed the worm and don't believe Alvarez will have any lingering health problems. No one knows exactly where she picked up the worm –- doctors said worms can come from eating undercooked pork or spread by people who don’t wash their hands after using the bathroom, according to the report.<br>  <br>  “It only takes one person who is spreading it constantly to get a lot of people exposed and some of those people are going to go on to develop this problem,” Nakaji said.<br>  <br>  Alvarez, who is now healthy and has resumed normal activities such a playing ball with family in her backyard, said she hopes people learn this lesson from her story.<br>  <br>  “Wash your hands, wash your hands,” she added.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Picture doesn't look TOO bad<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Heres the full report :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs6qm03g8c0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs6qm03g8...</a>|`|mItg2s1laa	isn't a cyst??|`|Pwmcpo5Paa	It sounds like trichinosis. I was in the Peace Corps in Bolivia and this was a problem. You could get it from eating uncooked pork, strawberries and lettuce. You ingest the larvae in all of these and the the worm travels up to the brain and starts eating away giving the person dizzinesss, blurry vision headaches hallucinations and possibly seizures. Mostly they just give you some strong meds to kill it then it just stays in your brain. It isnt something you want but chorizos and Bolivian street food and strawberries are good.<br>  In my professional opinion it is gross

iK3YYRaTaa	What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels<br>  <br>  <br>  There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes. <br>  <br>  Fasting Blood Sugar Test:<br>  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test. <br>  <br>  Random Blood Glucose Test:<br>  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes. <br>  <br>  Oral glucose tolerance test<br>  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus. <br>  <br>  Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test<br>  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes. <br>  <br>  Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have. <br>  <br>  One thing for sure you are headed down the path that leads to diabetes.. 250 pounds is very overweight. This is #1 cause of type 2 diabetes. You need a low glycemic diet. Now. And exercise 30 minutes a day everyday. Please!!!! We don't want you to have the misery that we have. And I mean it. Pain and suffering. At least 13 years off life span. When diagnosed with diabetes , you start out as if you already had your first heart attack. Please do something about your weight. <br>  <br>  Good luck my friend, stay healthy.|`|SB4N01OOaa	Normal fasting blood sugar for anyone is 70-100. <br>  <br>  If you had a blood sugar level of 174 while fasting (meaning you didn't eat anything for about 6 hours) it would be considered diabetes. The food you eat does cause it to rise, and I don't know the exact numbers about normal blood sugar levels when you've recently eaten.<br>  <br>  I very strongly recommend going to the doctor and getting a fasting blood sugar test done, because if you are diabetic then you need to know so you can come up with a plan for managing it.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything :)|`|ZNbauLJzaa	If your doctor told you your blood sugar was normal -  it's normal.  The blood test a doctor would use is more precise than the home test kit.<br>  All the carbs and sugar you ate would cause your sugar to be high.  You need to fast to get a number that means anything at home.  Try first thing in the morning before you eat anything.<br>  Also, unless  you like being 250 pounds three packets of sweeted oatmeal and a Dr Pepper aren't really good food choices.  There is soooo much sugar in those foods!|`|YL1NQ8ntaa	The basic levels are the same for everyone. What changes is your health.

VcDrJDtzaa	Are you a female? I wouldn't be worried about your psychological state. I don't know how old you are...but say if your 14ish and she is like 19...what her body looks like at 19 compared to a girl who may be your age is very different. So it may be something you are seeing for the first time, and it's absolutely normal....and it may happen again.

It would probably be soothing for a sore throat, just like hot tea and chicken soup, which are often recommended to people with colds.  In fact, if you have a cold and you're craving it, your body may be trying to tell you it would be good for you.

You would waste their time and the time of the ER staff because this is not an emergency.  What you need to do is go back to the endocrinologist and make an appointment with a diabetes educator since it is obvious that you are quite unfamiliar with the disease process and what your role is in it.  You really need to take responsibility for how your behavior and lifestyle contributed to the acquiring of the disease and disease process.  Not having a glucometer is unacceptable.  You can get them for free from an endo or even online and insurance covers most of the cost of the strips.|`|s13Lwnq4aa	Your sugar might be too low, eat or drink something sweet. <br>  Or it's too high and you need insulin.

Drink some juice, eat some candy or if you have to mix some sugar and water and drink it. Then you call 911 or get yourself to a doctor some way - preferably get a family member or friend to drive you. Don't fool around with it - do something right away!

7YPdogmDaa	Get a lotion with minimal bronzers, no tingle, hypoallergenic if your salon has it. It shouldn't irritate your skin anymore than it already is. Tanzotic makes a lotion called "natural", its made with emu oil and has no bronzers or tingle in it...its hypoallergenic.

I can swear to this day my son's skin is beautiful and it's been almost 3 yrs now. I used to rub a thin layer of lard on the eczema at night and whenever I didn't have to go out and leave it on.

They will have to sign something saying they won't buy any more for a few weeks and other things, because it is what druggies used to make either crack or meth from before it was regulated. Anyway, it will help you considerably with the congestion during the day. And it will cost them less than two dollars to buy you 24 tablets. I would not spend my only two dollars on them but if you are starting a job then it would be worth asking someone you know to buy them for you. Once you get paid there you can give them the money back. You should try it before you start your job in case you need to adjust the dose you take without it affecting your new job.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	quit drinking OJ.  drink more water, treat your symptoms, rest, and wash your hands well.  follow up with your doctor.|`|FQiqtP33aa	Take 1/2 Coldgaurd with 1 Avil 25. morning evening 2 days clear

It's that simple.<br>  <br>  The odor comes from bacteria that live on your skin. They digest the sebaceous oil that is secreted in your armpit, and a byproduct of their digestion causes the smell. You'll never be able to get rid of those bacteria by showering, but deodorant stays on the skin and keeps them in check, thereby eliminating the odor.
AmsnVhJSaa	There is a therapy named Mystic rose at osho asharam pune. The Mystic Rose is a three-week process, lasting three hours per day. During the first week, participants laugh "for no reason at all," dissolving the blocks to their inner spontaneity and joy. The second week is devoted to crying, and the third week to silent watching and meditation.<br>  <br>  Osho says about it:<br>  <br>  The symbol of the Mystic Rose is that if a man takes cares of the seed he is born with, gives it the right soil, gives it the right atmosphere and the right vibrations, moves on a right path where the seed can start growing, then the ultimate growth is symbolized as the mystic rose - when your being blossoms and opens all its petals and releases its beautiful fragrance. <br>  <br>  I have created a new meditation therapy. The first part will be laughter - for three hours, people simply laugh for no reason at all. Digging for three hours you will be surprised how many layers of dust have gathered upon your being. It will cut them like a sword, in one blow. For seven days continuously, three hours every day...you cannot conceive how much transformation can come to your being.<br>  <br>  And then the second part is tears. The first part removes everything that hinders your laughter - all the inhibitions of past humanity, all the repressions. It cuts them away, it brings a new space within you. But still you have to go a few steps more to reach the temple of your being, because you have suppressed so much sadness, so much despair, so much anxiety, so many tears - they are all there, covering you and destroying your beauty, your grace, your joy.<br>  <br>  The Mongolian idea was - and I agree with it - that life after life it goes on accumulating in you; it becomes almost a hard shell of pain. These wounds and scars have been developing for many lives. They are not part of the body, they are surrounding the consciousness and have to be released. That's why all the saints and sages have been telling you ― shouting ― "Go into yourself!" You listen but you don't go. There is a reason why you don't go. You know that going in, you will have to encounter pain; going in, you will have to encounter misery, suffering, agony. It is better to remain outside, engaged, busy.<br>  <br>  So for seven days, you have to allow yourself to weep, cry for no reason at all - the tears are just ready to come. You have been preventing them. Just don't prevent. <br>  <br>  Finally, the third part is witnessing: The Watcher on the Hills. After the laughter and the tears, there is only a witnessing silence. Witnessing on its own is automatically suppressive. Weeping stops when you witness it, it becomes dormant. This meditation gets rid of the laughter and tears beforehand, so that there is nothing to suppress in your witnessing. Then the witnessing simply opens a pure sky.|`|ElrCaKHQaa	There is a theory of counseling called Re-evaluation counseling that suggests such physical responses are natural ways to release stress caused by everyday upsets.  As children we do this easily and naturally.  You'd never accuse a child of having bottled up tension would you?  But as adults we are taught to hide our emotions, we suppress the physical response of crying, shaking, yawing and even laughing and hence accumulate stresses. <br>  <br>  Crying is an excellent way of releasing these emotions.  As your crying is making you feel better, I think it is a helpful release.  If your crying is not making you feel better then this is a cause for concern as it may be an indication of depression. <br>  <br>  So, whilst I think it is healthy that you cry, I would also suggest you think about what it is that is making you cry.  Obviously, you are fantastic and are able to do your job even though you don't enjoy it.  So what is it that happens that makes you feel bad?  Is it worth staying there even if the crying is helping you to cope? <br>  <br>  Lots of thinking for you to do.  You can have a look at the counseling website and look up a local group too.<a href="http://www.rc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rc.org/</a> It is free and and fantastic. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

Even if you are overweight, and if you didnt change your diet, you'd lose at least 2lbs by walking 30 min every day. I had a friend who lost weight walking. Personally i find it therapeutic.

Even sensitivities can trigger migraine, especially during a change of season like now entering spring.  Allergens play a vital role here in triggering migraine.  <br>  <br>  Are you worrying?  Worrying is also a triggering factor of migraine or any other headache.  Like school work, family or social interractions.  <br>  <br>  You know you are not too young to be having high blood pressure as a result of the above. <br>  <br>  What you perhaps need is rest, and desist from snacks and saturated ffats in KFC's, Burger King and other fast food restaurants, as young people your age crave.<br>  <br>  Try eat natural foods, vegetables and fruits, and take Vitamin B complex vitamins.  If my solutions do not help please see your general practitioner, and take the prescribe medications as stipulated on the label.<br>  <br>  And, lastly please go to bed relatively early, and do not stay up watch television especially in the dark or too near, as radiation and bright lights can trigger headaches, and so finally have your eyes tested if your vision seems to bother you, and if you were glasses have them on when watching tv, playing nintendos, or have them reviewed by the optometrist.  Wish you best, and hope your headache may vanish.<br>  <br>  I do forget, please do not forget the Lord Jesus and pray to him about your headache and any worrying that bothers you, he can  help, for he is God.|`|Y4iBoPhbaa	How bad does it hurt.

b0qKOoBRaa	Professionals recommend that you lose a MAXIMUM of 2 lbs. per week.  So, no.  The only way to permanently lose weight is to do so in a healthy manner by developing better habits.  It sounds like you already have very good eating and exercise habits in place, so I wouldn't focus on your weight as much as remaining healthy.  If you're unhappy with your body, you may want to add weight lifting to your routine so that the weight you do have is lean and will look great.  Pushing your body too hard can have the opposite effects of what you're going for, so be careful  Keep up your already stellar habits and your body will get smaller and more efficient. I have yo-yo'd a lot in college because I tend to lose weight in really unhealthy ways and then I always gain it all back.|`|xnHV9oQkaa	Possible but not at all healthy.<br>  You can diet, and you could step on the scale in a month and see you now weight 105 lbs while your body may look exactly the same.<br>  Fat is stored in the body, and while dieting can help put a dent in it, it takes exercise too, to really get rid of it.|`|y4eTE1Ihaa	Exercise is just as vital as diet when it comes to losing weight, but the only thing which clearly showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was reported in Fox News and CNN.

It also seems that your old group of friends are fastidious.  They seem to enjoy drama and enjoy making people feel bad.  I believe you should find a new group of friends who accept you for who you are.  But the key to having people accept you is to not flaunt yourself as the popular girl and not to seek people's attention by butting in on their conversations.  These only make people view you as extremely high-strung and into yourself and will find you annoying.  To raise your self-esteem, make a new friend, and make his or her day.  Treat them well, and they will treat you well.  And then, poof, all is well!
CDUJMFuyaa	Sorry to say but what your friend said is true. Mind you that you are not getting the required amount of calories you are suppose to be getting. Doing this leads to the starvation mode. Your metabolism will start to slow down, and cause easier weight gain for you. Also, your body will begin to eat your own organs. Yes, you can die because of this. That is lack of nutrients and can lead you to faint eventually.|`|of049X1waa	If you ate fruit and spaghetti, that isn't the same as fasting, and running half a mile won't burn it off.  You should be fine eating that much, however if you actually fast, as in no food, it will make you sick.  Not skinny because your metabolism will slow down, but sick and malnourished.|`|YFi64qyeaa	You will not lose weight because your body will go into reserve mode and begin to store fat. If you want to fast then go with a liquid diet that will give you the nutrients your body needs. You can make juices with veggies and fruits and include protien powder with it.|`|HugRTUPsaa	This is also known as starving yourself. You've consumed about 300 calories, which is close to 15% of the normal minimum. Running for half a mile won't burn that much.<br>  <br>  Listen to our friend, she is right. You're actually consuming less than someone on a LigherLife diet, and that is very rapid weight loss. Maintaining this kind of limited calorific intake could have serious repurcussions.<br>  <br>  That said, you're will power would have to be strong to maintain it, your body would be screaming for sustenance after a few days.|`|jq0q8NBkaa	Your friend is right. <br>  Your fat and muscle will burn away <br>  And then when it's run out of all the other muscle it eats away your heart muscle and you die <br>  You wont even last 40 days|`|rG6CkvmHaa	i went 2 weeks and lost 20 pds but if u run w/o eating ull black out an die lol|`|PyhWvCoOaa	Carry on with this and you will die.

What i always do to prevent cravings is to have a whole lot of work to do, and not be bored. Cause when your bored, you eat. You eat because you think it tastes good, and because it doesnt make you bored.

As a result, saliva got mixed with the cement, making a weak set.<br>  <br>  2. If somebody clenches and / or grind his / her teeth then the teeth flex a lot. As a result, the cement gets loose and the crown bridge comes off.<br>  <br>  3. If there is new / recurrent decay underneath. Then the seal gets compromised and the whole thing comes off. <br>  <br>  4. If the bite / occlusion on the crown / bridge is not adjusted properly.

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|eHBKMtxyaa	You have made a good choice by looking into Acai. <br>  <br>  Acai berries have far more antioxidants than any other fruit. Even more than blueberries! Besides that, the nutrients in acai berry supplements help many other diseases and maladies, from diabetes to arthritis to blood clotting. It really is a worthwhile supplement to add to your daily nutrition.<br>  <br>  Acai has great anti-aging benefits, will cleanse and detoxify you, and has destroyed cancer cells in recent studies. You really can't go wrong by adding an acai supplement to your daily vitamin regimen. So far it's working for me by helping my digestion, curbing my appetite, and by giving me more energy each day... I don't even get sleepy around 3pm anymore.<br>  <br>  Acai berries are a great weight loss aid. The berry’s natural concoction of essential fatty acids, fiber, phytosterols and amino acids work together to help your body burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly and shed the unwanted pounds that you’d like to lose.<br>  <br>  The fatty acids and amino acids aid in both muscle development and proper digestion, both of which are essential to fat loss. The fiber helps your body to move food out of your system quicker and also to help you feel full, as do fatty acids. Phytosterols help fortify your digestive tract, moving waste materials out and absorbing nutrients more efficiently.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you what I recommend, and then I'll tell you why...<br>  <br>  I recommend you get a free trial of Acai Power from <a href="http://barbiefood.com/acai-free-trial.html" rel="nofollow">http://barbiefood.com/acai-free-trial.ht...</a> <br>  This is the product I use, and honestly I feel better every day. If you don't like it, just don't reorder it... but you'll like it. =)<br>  <br>  I attempted this past weekend to find a good acai supplement at GNC, Vitamin World, Hannafords, and Shaws, but I was unable to find something that was cheap, high quality, and not filled with sugar and other fillers. I am going to keep getting Acai Power for now.|`|c1WWBUkkaa	I have lost quite a bit of weight (85 pounds now) on the Acai berry compliments.

ENnO8ga4aa	first of all i love how ur dog is looking at you like, "hey... nice pose" lol. and i would give you an 8. i mean u are really good looking but to get a 10 you would need to do a little bit of crunches and situps to firm up ur belly a little more. it still looks great and if ur at the beach ppl wont even notice it and will think u look great cuz remember there's always very fat ppl at the beach so u'll look flawless. but since ur askin us to rate you...yea. but if ur not suckin it in, then its just fine. you can totally forget about the crunches. another last thing is your bikini. I would try a 2 piece bikini that would match a little more. well, black goes with anything but maybe a bikini that makes ppl know you bought both pieces together and not maybe just tried matching something up at home. i think those shorts make your hips look a little too wide. it has kinda like a heavy look.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	You think you're a 10 but considering your hips and stomach are big and your legs are flabby and untoned you are probably a 4 or 5.

c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	If you had an electrocardiogram, an echocardiogram, and a 'tilt test' then you were thoroughly evaluated.  If all of these were normal and a physician was able to document that a change in body position - from lying to sitting or from sitting to standing - caused a drop in blood pressure and an elevation in pulse then your diagnosis is postural hypotension.  All of us experience a very brief drop in blood pressure when we change positions but if all is working well it is too brief to cause symptoms.  Some individuals have a disorder of what is referred to as sympathetic tone in the nervous system.  It is not a disease and it does not lead to problems if it is treated.  When the blood pressure drops the rise in pulse is compensatory in order to maintain circulation.  Postural hypotension has been treated with added salt to the diet but this has not been shown to be effective.  In the past pseudoephedrine was used and this was somewhat effective.  Today the drug of choice is midodrine which is very effective.  If I may be of further assistance please let me know.  My wife has postural hypotension and takes midodrine.  The condition is not that uncommon.  I wish you the very best of health and may God Bless.|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Good chance of a periodic supraventricular arrythmia.

Donate      ! :D|`|9SXnUOb3aa	LESS than a month is impossible.<br>  <br>  I did it by cutting calories, in one month.<br>  But then again, men lose weight faster and easier than women.|`|J3Ye4AL6aa	Sorry to say but its not possible.<br>  and even if you could lose it that fast you would gain it all right back because the faster you lose it the unhealthier and the faster it comes back on.<br>  Just work out and eat healthy, drink lots of water to get rid of some of the water retention in your body it will flush it out. Work out before a big meal like Dinner because your metabolism is at its peak after a workout therefore it will burn off your food alot quicker.|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	Breakfast- Akins shake and piece of fruit no earlier than 9am<br>  Lunch- Sushi, salad or subway sandwich. Eat what ever you want on the salad and sandwich...even dressing. Take multi-vitamin.<br>  Dinner- Akins shake and nothing else.<br>  <br>  DRINK LOTS OF WATER AND NO SODA. BLACK COFFEE OKAY.<br>  <br>  30-min cardio at night. Make it intense.<br>  <br>  Go to bed hungry. You will wake up 1-2 pounds lighter every day.<br>  <br>  PS NO snacking!!! <br>  <br>  Remember that diet is 80% of the cause of weight gain/weight loss. Good luck!|`|gC6Yyq3qaa	It is not healthy to lose that much in a month.

83TkWic3aa	Holy solicitors! Doesn't look like your getting a straight answer-if you want that rock hard look in your soft but slim belly, join a gym! There is a machine that you do sit ups on and you can add weight to it. Don't just do straight up and down crunchs, put your knees to one side at a time during a set. Fergies abs are 'sculpted', if your looking for the same, you need to work all muscle groups not just the main. <br>  No teas or berry's is gonna give you the look, you have to work for it. Celebs have trainers that help them, you should look into a short membership at a gym or join a kick boxing class. Hope this helped :D|`|JsuevakEaa	join a dance class, since that is probably why fergie has such nice abs, because she dances alot and works out...any way i have a friend who is in dance and she has killer abs and is overall really fit. crunches will work, but it will probably take longer without the cardio bc you need to be tottally fit to have abs that you can see.
dWlp4fOLaa	you need help from a neurologist, fast! YOU HAVE TOURETTES SYNDROME!
8d8ejHPfaa	Yeah, it is....your eyes only get red for 2 hours?  Mine swell up for almost a day... Hit up the Visine, and make sure you drink plenty of water, you'd be surprised how much water you can release from crying like that, and you've apparently been bottling some stuff up for awhile... It is draining to cry like that, when your releasing that sort of pent up stuff, you tighten your muscles from the stress, that's why you feel sore after, there are other physiological changes that take place when you cry also, changes in blood pressure, heart beat, breathing, and facing things that are bothering you can be stressful, and cause more adrenaline, also could possibly be some dehydration, which of course is why I mentioned making sure to drink lots of water... It takes a lot of effort to hold on to stuff and try to get on with your life, and also a lot to let it go... At least they say that people who cry live longer, it releases toxins as well as emotional toxins ....|`|4CsGde1qaa	Yes, it is normal to cry and it shouldn't matter how you do it. Really, even my favorite Spongebob cries, even though he cries extremely weird?, it is an expression of sadness and i understand the emotion. I cry too, and unfortunately it is true. Back then, I always took  crying as a wimp, but now I cry for happiness, and sometimes, just sometimes I cry when I just seen a beautiful moment in the movie scene. I usually notice when I see people about to cry, even though it is not me I feel emotional about it and something in me urges to help them, help them... Anyway, crying is good for relief, crying is okay, crying now.|`|GvQHw4Ntaa	That's definitely normal if you're crying hard (not just tearing up a bit) and emotionally distressed, which I assume you are since you're crying and feeling emotionally drained afterward. <br>  <br>  Try taking a hot bath or listening to relaxing music after a good cry. It'll help you recover and you won't have that feeling of just having cried. If you have time, change into comfortable clothes and pamper yourself a bit when you're feeling drained... it really helps. It's also really important to stay hydrated... that will help keep your energy up. <br>  <br>  Expressing emotion is an important part of dealing with emotional issues, but if you're very concerned about it I'd mention it to your therapist. In my opinion, it's perfectly healthy to cry sometimes (and you probably need to after not crying in so long) and feeling tired afterward is totally normal... it takes a lot out of you. And whatever you're working through, it's most likely a sign of progress. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FCmuA1KEaa	After a bad break-up, and days of crying I was told it's because so much water gets drained from your body. Plus, it takes a lot out of you in general when you cry. Just think about it-most people make some sort of movement plus breathing gets changed. A lot of energy is involved...|`|PztDZBW1aa	i think it is just normal, it happens to me all the time. just try to do things to relax yourself afterwards.

3QIWdvG1aa	Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, slow-growing bacteria that thrive in areas of the body that are rich in blood and oxygen, such as the lungs.<br>  <br>  Pulmonary TB (in the lungs) is contagious. It spreads when a person who has active TB breathes out air that has the TB bacteria in it and then another person breathes in the bacteria from the air. An infected person releases even more bacteria when he or she does things like cough or laugh.<br>  <br>  If TB is only in other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB), it does not spread easily to others.|`|hL6MGrMoaa	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a pathogenic bacterial species in the genus Mycobacterium and the causative agent of most cases of tuberculosis. First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on the cell surface (primarily mycolic acid), which makes the cells impervious to Gram staining; acid-fast techniques are used instead. The physiology of M. tuberculosis is highly aerobic and requires high levels of oxygen. Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, MTB infects the lungs, causing pneumonia.Diagnosis<br>  <br>  Sputum is taken on three successive mornings as the number of organisms could be low, and the specimen is treated with 3% KOH or NaOH for liquefaction and decontamination. Gram stain should never be performed, as the organism is an "acid-fast bacillus" (AFB), meaning that it retains certain stains after being treated with acidic solution. In the most common staining technique, the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, AFB are stained a bright red, which stands out clearly against a blue background; therefore, the bacteria are sometimes called red snappers. The reason for the acid-fast staining is because of its thick waxy cell wall. The waxy quality of the cell wall is mainly due to the presence of mycolic acids. This waxy cell wall also is responsible for the typical caseous granuloma formation in tuberculosis. The component responsible, trehalose dimycolate, is called the cord factor. A grading system exists for interpretation of the microscopic findings based on the number of organisms observed in each field. It should be noted that the Ziehl-Neelsen stain is positive in only 50% of cases, which means that, even if no organisms are observed, further investigation is still required. Acid-fast bacilli can also be visualized by fluorescent microscopy using auramine-rhodamine stain for screening, which makes them appear somewhat golden in color. Also, M. tuberculosis is grown on a selective medium known as Lowenstein-Jensen medium, which has traditionally been used for this purpose. However, this method is quite slow, as this organism requires 6-8 weeks to grow, which delays reporting of results. A faster results can now be obtained using Middlebrook medium.<br>  <br>  It should be taken into consideration that during an advanced stage of tuberculosis, the organism may infect almost any part of the body, which means that a specimen should appropriately be chosen (e.g. intestinal tuberculosis-stool).<br>  <br>  An immunochromatographic serological assay for the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis has also been developed.[13]
sTdlAMv7aa	Generally, the production of testosterone & other androgens follow a daily cycle (as opposed to a monthly one) for younger men (in puberty & up to 40 something), with an abundance of testosterone produced during sleep.  Hence, men will have the highest amount of testosterone in the morning & this concentration will gradually decrease throughout the day.  This partly accounts for "morning wood".  However, various activities can raise testosterone during the day, such as a victory (or anticipation of it), a challenging activity, weight lifting, & perhaps sexually attractive people.  During puberty, testosterone production can reach levels higher than normal reference range values.  Other hormones like human Growth Hormone (hGH) increase during puberty & follow 4-5 day surges during growth spurts.<br>  High libido probably corresponds to relatively high amounts of testosterone (& adequate estrogen/estradiol), as well as other hormones.|`|5tqh0akYaa	I dont think it comes once a month, Its pretty much 24/7 .. Please dont go knock up a girl go jack off (lol)|`|YDykVkcmaa	The level of testosterone in your body is maintained at a pretty constant level. It can be decreased or increased by a number of factors such as stress, diet, alcohol and smoking.|`|AA11357422	Our bodies like to run in cyclical patterns. For guys your age its a bit different because while going through puberty the amount of testosterone and other hormones increases your libido will increase and make you feel that way. <br>  No worries its just your body pretending that its ready for sex. hahaha<br>  Once its ready in some years your mind will try to catch up! hahaha Such is life!

klFuOI0Aaa	Hey, this sounds really similar to what I have. It sounds like osgood slaughter to me because with that you'll develop a bump below your knee cap and with pressure such as walking a lot, running, and espically jumping it can become painful. And then your back may begin to feel achy because with me personally my osgood slaughter has hurt my femoral never which starts in your knee runs up your thigh over your hip to your lower back. But, then again I'm not a doctor and you should go to your family doctor. Until then though ice it, try not to apply too much pressure to it like jumping and then my doctor told me most people will grow out of it. I've had mine since 4th grade and I'm in 11th grade now. But my knee has more issues than just osgood slaughter haha. Best of luck to you though!|`|gUBgKegjaa	if i was u i would go to the doc becuz he will tell u whats wrong with ur knee ok he/she will help u <br>  <br>  thanks<br>   i hope i helped|`|UmdPAqataa	It definitely sounds like Osgoode Schlatter's.  Here is a quick summary of what it is all about<br>  The condition is usually self-limiting and is caused by stress on the patellar tendon that attaches the quadriceps muscle at the front of the thigh to the tibial tuberosity. Following an adolescent growth spurt, repeated stress from contraction of the quadriceps is transmitted through the patellar tendon to the immature tibial tuberosity. This can cause multiple subacute avulsion fractures along with inflammation of the tendon, leading to excess bone growth in the tuberosity and producing a visible lump.<br>  <br>  The syndrome may develop without trauma or other apparent cause. But some studies report up to 50% of patients give a history of precipitating trauma.<br>  <br>  Does this sound like you?|`|IH5R6bpaaa	It sounds like a bursa sac to me. Ull be fine

geMRkVJbaa	It depends on your age. If you are post menopausal (hormonally speaking) they look quite small. If you are younger, they are larger with black dots on them representing the follicles. The only difference is that when the uterus is removed the ovaries lose one one their 'anchor points' and can move around a bit more and be harder to find.
Zm5cNZFIaa	Depends on how long you have had this problem. In the mean time you should have some sort of electrolyte top up.

0cfwrcx5aa	having sex with one person too much, can affect your desire to sex them in the future.  its like...been there, done that.   moderation helps extend it.<br>  <br>  if you mean like pornstar amounts of sex, with various people....im sure it would have some affect.  you'll never get tired of sex, just sex with the same people.<br>  <br>  <br>  then again, everyone is different, so, who knows?

rHqe7oMoaa	The muscle turns to fat|`|5BmnSiqUaa	Go with ellie's answer.<br>  <br>  While it may appear so, muscle can't turn into fat.  That's a chemical impossibility.  <br>  <br>  Just look at the striations of fat-muscle-fat-muscle in a slice of bacon.  Nothing in there even hints at the possibility of muscle turning into fat or vice versa.<br>  <br>  Muscle shrinkage due to lack of use is called atrophy.  Just ask anyone who's had a leg cast removed.  Muscle atrophy is also a major hazard of extended space travel.  They don't show it much but astronauts returning from extended space flight lose so much muscle mass and so much bone density that when they return to Earth gravity, they're placed on wheelchairs to avoid fractures.<br>  <br>  What does usually happen is that muscle weight is eventually substituted with fat weight.  (By the way, muscle weighs more than fat.  Check out the difference in mass between 4 pounds of very lean steak and 4 pounds of very fatty beef in the supermarket.)<br>  <br>  Think about it, if muscle turns to fat, all sedentary people should eventually turn into 100% fat!<br>  <br>  Doesn't happen.<br>  <br>  .<br>  .|`|SB4N01OOaa	The muscle will simply shrink in size and become weaker.

X6A6RpNlaa	Hello dear,<br>  <br>  Don't worry! I used to be in your position a few years ago when I got my period for the first time. I was 13 years old, and even now, I continue to experience irregular menstruation. Menstruation is different for every single woman. I doubt that any two women experience exactly the same symptoms/cycles!<br>  <br>  First off, it is important to remember that because you are a virgin (no sexual contact/"fooling around with a guy" whatsoever!), you can rule out pregnancy and STDs completely.<br>  <br>  Secondly, like you said, you've only had your period once before. It is very common for young girls who have just started menstruating to have extremely unpredictable periods. One month, you could be right on time with a perfect 28-day cycle, and the next, you find yourself cramped, bloated, lower-back-ached for days and late. But don't freak out! You're not alone! This is normal. If you really feel insecure, talk to someone you trust who can sympathize with period pains. If anything, s/he can take you to the gynecologist to get a proper diagnosis and peace of mind.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped. Good luck, sweetie! =)<br>  <br>  P.S. Try to stop stressing out because stress can also delay your period or make you miss it entirely!|`|0Ns2ssyPaa	There is a reason why periods are referred to as the "female flu."  Since you just started, it takes a while for it to become regular and stress can cause it to begin earlier or later than what it is expected; there are very few women who have a 28 day cycle.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is not unusual for girl's periods to be very irregular for the first couple of years.  They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.  When you get regular, your period will start anywhere from 25-35 days apart and all are normal, but most are usually about 28 days.<br>  <br>  welcome to womanhood..|`|16bWGB14aa	That could be a sign that it's coming soon.

I don't necessarily believe that.<br>  <br>  Pay attention to the color of shirt you're wearing and your surrounding when you check the color of your eyes.  Your eyes reflect light, and they could be reflecting whatever color of shirt you're wearing.  Also, the level of light can also affect the color.<br>  <br>  Try this:  check the color of your eyes in the same place with the same light level every time.  Then, on a day they look different to you, go back to that same place and put on the same shirt you were wearing before.  I am willing to bet that you eye color goes back to normal.  :)

The average man should eat about 170 grams of protein a day, so you might want to cut back a little.|`|AA10531094	Yes, you can lose a significant amount of water, which puts you at risk of dehydration, particularly if you exercise heavily.<br>  <br>  That water loss often shows up on the scale as weight loss. But along with losing water, you lose muscle mass and bone calcium. The dehydration also strains your kidneys and puts stress on your heart.<br>  <br>  And dehydration from a ketogenic diet can make you feel weak and dizzy, give you bad breath, or lead to other problems. <br>  <br>  The amount of protein you require depends on your weight and your daily caloric intake. Most Americans consume more than enough protein in their daily diets. A few specific groups of people are at risk for being protein-deficient, including elderly women and people with illnesses or eating disorders. A protein deficiency is defined as eating 50% to 75% of the recommended amount of daily protein, Butterfield explains.<br>  <br>  Ideally, you should consume 0.36 grams of protein for every pound of body weight, according to recommended daily allowances (RDA) set by the Food and Nutrition Board. So if you weigh 170 pounds, you need about 61 grams of protein each day.<br>  <br>  Protein should also make up approximately 15% of your total daily caloric intake, also according to the RDA. In a diet of 1,800 calories a day, for example, about 270 of those calories should come from protein.|`|5nmvSXr4aa	Yes, I'm fairly certain there are problems with too much protein intake.  200gr is a LOT of protein - bodybuilder type intake.  <br>  <br>  "Watch the Protein<br>  To quickly determine your daily protein in grams, divide your weight in pounds by 2. Too much daily protein may cause hepatic encephalopathy (mental confusion). This occurs when the amount of dietary protein is greater than the liver's ability to use the protein. This causes a build up of toxins that can interfere with brain function. Protein is restricted in patients with clinical evidence of encephalopathy. However, controversy exists regarding the type of protein a diet should contain. Vegetable and dairy protein may be tolerated better than meat protein. Medications, such as lactulose and neomycin, may be used to help control hepatitis-related encephalopathy. Due to the body's need for proteins, protein restriction should only be undertaken with a doctor's advice."|`|iS5LwpY5aa	Yes, it can be hard on your internal organs, especially your kidneys.|`|iXX0QzvXaa	You would be putting yourself at risk by using the powder!<br>  Food wise, protein usually decreases the production of Insulin, so as long as you don't eat too many Carbohydrates you will only lose Fat!<br>  Protein metabolism in your case is NOT harmful, as long as you stay away from the powdered form, it might not be good due to its ingredients!|`|vx2MaQg0aa	That is way too much man unless you weight 380lb..

B12E4rYiaa	To lose weight you have to lose overall body fat there is no such thing as spot reduction. So you need to eat a 1500 calorie diet of healthy foods.

Try not eating any candy, ice cream, cake, or anything like that!  Run for at least 30 minutes everyday, and remember to drink lots of water!  Try doing at least 50 sit ups a day too..and push ups...Try thinking of all the exercises you know and do them every day!  But remember, don't rush it all at once, then it will just hurt your body!

Whether it is soothing music, getting warm with warm milk or bundling up, having a nice breeze flow in to get your at a nice body temperature, etc. It helps if you haven't had caffeine or sugar recently. It is simply about settling down. You can try relaxing activities that don't stimulate your body (i.e. studying, reading a book, crosswords, etc.). Don't stimulate your eyes by going on the computer or watching TV. Breathe calmly and slowly to relax (deep breaths).
0KGJRVMNaa	If that were true, it is probably not even that uncommon. In North America, our society is against it, but there are people in this world who do that, whether you like it or not.<br>  Does it mean you're gay? Everyone is going to say that, but I don't believe it does. I think people can just have some damn sex and it isn't going to change their entire sexual orientation. You can't ask if you're gay or not, because nobody knows that answer. You aren't a virgin if you've had sex...|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	It's not uncommon dear. If you really have been having sex then no, you are not a virgin anymore.<br>  You should use condoms and lubricant for your comfort and safety.|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	I don't know what's more strange the fact that you having sex with your cousin, or the fact that your having sex with you cousin.... whose a guy|`|YDykVkcmaa	The dictionary definition of virgin is: "a person who has never had sexual intercourse."<br>  <br>  So if there has been no sexual penetration (intercourse) then you are a virgin - end of story!<br>  <br>  <br>  There are many reasons why you may or may not be having sex with your cousin and being Gay or Not Gay is only one of those reasons.<br>  <br>  If the idea of girls turns you on then you are not totally gay. However, you could be bi-sexual - only time will tell.<br>  <br>  Your cousin may have, in subtle ways, forced you (this can be via a power play, psychological pressure or other ways).<br>  <br>  You may simply enjoy the orgasms you get and continue to have sex because of the pleasure - again does not mean you are gay as you may grow out of it when you find a girl friend.<br>  <br>  Sex between relatives, although frowned upon in many cultures, is very common and only now, with the publicity of cases that are discovered and the media attention aimed at it is its commonality becoming known and understood.<br>  <br>  Sex between relatives was very common in members of the nobility because of the low number of people in that upper-circle that limited, dramatically, the number of people you could get married to.<br>  <br>  In fact it is mentioned in the bible and in certain cases supported. Check out the sin of Onan who was struck dead by God for refusing to have a child by his sister-in-law.<br>  <br>  What you are describing is not terrible, sick, unusual, perverted, etc.<br>  <br>  It may be abusive if your cousin is or did use force or coercion but that would be the worst of it.<br>  <br>  Be aware that when your cousin reaches his majority (at 16 in some places and 18 in others) if the practise continues he could be breaking the law and be charged with having sex with a minor.|`|srUuoCwcaa	Despite the taboo, an attraction to a close relative like a cousin really isn't that unusual, I think. In fact, I would be willing to bet that most people have felt something, at some point, akin to an attraction to a cousin or half-sibling, etc.<br>  <br>  That said, your actions do probably carry some weight as regards your sexuality though. And that's fine. You like who you like. It's not as though you're siblings, and you certainly can't damage the gene pool. While it may be prudent to examine possibilities outside your cousin (for obvious societal reasons), a little experimentation doesn't hurt. No one has a right to judge you. <br>  <br>  As for your virginity: In a technical sense, no you would not be considered a virgin. But it is my firm conviction that something like one's virginity can never be "taken," only freely given. In that case, it's up to you to consider this matter for yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck, don't let others get to you, and I hope everything works out for the best. : )|`|6rAV4c1raa	REDNECK!!!!!!

wGTisY1aaa	hers what you were looking for and a little extra<br>  Carbohydrates<br>  <br>  First things first, fad diets don’t work. The reason being is that fad diets almost always severely cut carbohydrate foods from the list of recommended consumption. Simply put, our brain, heart, and muscles among other vital organs ate fueled by glucose which comes from carbohydrates. When your body does not get enough carbohydrates, within a few days your body starts to produce an alternative fuel source known as ketosis. This is from the partial breakdown of fatty acids which is called ketosis. The intial weight loss is NOT fat loss but water, as the kidneys attempt to get rid of excess ketones. This causes an imbalance of chemicals in your body because your blood becomes more acidic, which can lead to potentially serious or unpleasant side effects such as headaches, bad breathe, dizziness, faintness, and fatigue. Even though you burn fat because your body is depending on more amino acids (protein) form the breakdown of lean muscle tissue, you are hurting your body in the process. So basically, while you are burning fatter you are also burning your muscles, causing them to breakdown. Another reason low-to-no carbohydrate diets are not good is that you will have lower energy levels and a shorter time to reach fatigue during exercise. So most of your workouts will be low intensity when you need to be able to alternate between low and high intensity workouts to help you burn more fat and to help keep your metabolism up. In short, carbohydrates help metabolize fat and help your brain, heart, and muscles function not just through exercise but through everyday life. It is also important for your carbohydrate to be spaced evenly throughout your meals so you can be sure that you have enough energy for what may come up during the course of your day. Keep in mind on your lower intensity days of workouts you will not need to; have as many carbohydrates because you will not be doing a lot to where you can burn them off. Carbohydrates will take up half of your daily allotted caloric intake or needs. I cannot stress enough how important carbohydrates are in your daily diet. As long as they are complex carbohydrates and not simple carbohydrates (simple carbohydrates enter your bloodstream faster and cause your insulin level to rise quickly and serve no purpose) you will be doing your body the greatest deed you could imagine. <br>  <br>  PROTEINS<br>  <br>  Diets that cut protein drastically are another form of unhealthy eating. General fatigue, muscle soreness, and overall weakness come with a low protein diet. As old cells die and new form the body protein is constantly being turned over. It takes one year; science has proven, for 98% of the atoms in your body to be replaced. In three months your body produces a new skeleton. In six weeks you produce a new liver. As new tissue is synthesized, the proteins in your muscles are being turned over as muscle is being broken down. All of these cells come from the protein you eat everyday. In order for protein synthesis to occur, an adequate amount of essential and non- essential amino acids (protein) is vital. All it takes is one of the essential amino acids to be missing and synthesis is halted. Restricted protein intake will result in protein degradation and catabolism, which is muscle breakdown. This is the reasoning behind protein taking up two parts of your daily caloric needs.<br>  <br>  <br>  FATS <br>  <br>  Diets where you cut fat considerably are usually healthy. It’s the diets that cut out the unsaturated fats that are unhealthy. The four soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) are carried by fat and it cushions your kidneys, liver, and nerves. Research has shown that an extremely limited intake of unsaturated fat can lead to elevated cholesterol, which can lead to heart attacks and stroke. So I guess what I’m telling you are that fat-free diets are out. This is why the fat of your daily caloric needs is only one part.<br>  <br>  * Always follow your doctor’s orders first. I am not a licensed dietician, these are merely suggestions based on my experience and weight loss.<br>  <br>  Calorie-restricted diets<br>  <br>  The number one priority of your body is to obtain ample energy to carry on vital functions that include circulation, respiratory, and digestion. Without sufficient dietary fats, carbohydrates, and proteins, your body will break down protein in your blood, liver, pancreas, and other vital organs to maintain their function. The only time you should follow a low-calorie diet is under your doctor’s supervision.<br>  <br>  Fad diets<br>  <br>  Avoid fad dieting all together. The best way to lose weight is to work hard for it. A healthy diet should be a lifestyle, not something that can harm you.

It's cheap and easy energy.  Excess carbs are converted to fat.  Your basic answer from a diet perspective.|`|EwR91zQuaa	in the simplist form they are anything like: pasta,bread,potatoes,cereal,spaghetti etc.<br>  you know anything you might have along the side of your dinner/lunch.<br>  hope dis helped!xXxX|`|G1OSlub8aa	Carbohydrates (from 'hydrates of carbon') or saccharides (Greek σ?κχαρον, sákcharon, meaning "sugar") are the most abundant of the four major classes of biomolecules. They fill numerous roles in living things, such as the storage and transport of energy (eg: starch, glycogen) and structural components (eg: cellulose in plants, chitin and cartilage in animals). Additionally, carbohydrates and their derivatives play major roles in the working process of the immune system, fertilization, pathogenesis, blood clotting, and development.[1]<br>  <br>  Chemically, carbohydrates are simple organic compounds that are aldehydes or ketones with many hydroxyl groups added, usually one on each carbon atom that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone functional group. The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides, such as glucose, galactose, and fructose. The general stoichiometric formula of an unmodified monosaccharide is (C·H2O)n, where n is any number of three or greater; however, not all carbohydrates conform to this precise stoichiometric definition (eg: uronic acids, deoxy-sugars such as fucose), nor are all chemicals that do conform to this definition automatically classified as carbohydrates.[2]<br>  <br>  Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called polysaccharides (or oligosaccharides) in almost limitless ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example, deoxyribose, a component of DNA, is a modified version of ribose; chitin is composed of repeating units of N-acetylglucosamine, a nitrogen-containing form of glucose.
9MEcOGOvaa	well defin. you should use something aerobic(that speeds up your heartrate).. like the stairmaster, treadmill, elliptical ..<br>  <br>  now that being said i'd personally recommend the elliptical since it works out more (ur arms, thigh, butt, lower back, and arms) for ur time.. not to mention since it does that it helps you burn more calories for your time working out...<br>  <br>  maybe work out about 2hrs a week however you want to do .. like two days one hour each.. or maybe 4 days 30min each<br>  <br>  then when you find that your starting to stay longer without getting so tired.. add a little more time .. also ... unlike common misconception you could work out with wieghts and not look all bulk u cant look very musclar only lean yourself and tighten (freeweights or machine) prob. since ur beginner i'd say machine weights..<br>  <br>  so the machine. like these-<br>  <a href="http://athletic-scholarships.net/gym%202..." rel="nofollow">http://athletic-scholarships.net/gym%202...</a><br>  <br>  try do work with a weight lets say 5lbs in which u can do lets say 10 times (each time you do one lets it's called repetition-rep for short..so<br>  <br>  10 reps when you complete these reps thats called one set...<br>  <br>  then rest.. for about 10-15sec..<br>  <br>  then another 10 times..

I think you're hungry because (as I see it), you've eaten nothing but carbs and sugar all day.  Muffins, cookies, rice, french toast, mango pie, these are NOT great foods.  You should really try to stick to a high protein, low carb diet if you want to lose weight.  (Just don't go all Dr. Atkins.  It's not a healthy, permanent fix.)

There are no natural remedies for UTI.  You need to take antibiotics.  Untreated, UTI can lead to permanent kidney damage.  NOT taking the antibiotics will be a lot more harmful than taking them.  You can try eating yogurt or taking probiotics during an after your course of antibiotics, to reduce risk of yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Also, it sounds like you have frequent UTI.  If you do, you should see a specialist (urologist) to try to find out what is causing the frequent infections.<br>  <br>  Edit: Drinking water and cranberry juice can help prevent infections, but they will not cure an infection you already have.|`|SB4N01OOaa	Get it checked out anyway; better safe than sorry.

That is why it is important to continue getting Pap Smears- to monitor it.  Often HPV lies dormant and no real problems develop.  Sometimes HPV can cause the cells of the cervix to change, which over time (usually many years) can become precancerous and even cancerous.  With regular Pap smears, the cervical cell changes will be monitored before it progresses to that point.  After multiple abnormal pap smears your doctor may choose to do a colposcopy- a procedure that takes a small sample of the cervical cells for biopsy.  <br>  <br>  If all of this is information you were not told about or you have questions, please get more information from your doctor's office or a reputable online source like WebMD.  A lot of bad information can be passed by people on the internet that mean well.|`|vdXnvJwMaa	Have you had any treatments yet?  HPV doesn't just clear up on its own depending on the grade.  You may need to have a colposcopy where they will freeze your cervix so the lining of the outside will slough off.  They will do this more then once.  Have you talked to your doctor about HPV and do you understand what having it means, if not ask your doctor for more information and treatment options? Plus if your BF hasn't been tested he needs to be.  If you get treated and he doesn't and you continue to have intercourse you will get it again.  cover all of your bases.  Good Luck.
wwP3ONCFaa	Must be sore throat. <br>  If your sore throat is caused by a viral infection, antibiotics won't help it. But medicated lozenges containing phenol may do some good.The phenol can kill surface germs, thereby keeping the invaders in check until your body has a chance to build up its resistance. And its mild anesthetic action numbs raw nerve endings so your throat doesn't feel as scratchy. These lozenges come in various strengths, so follow package directions.<br>  <br>  Gargle! If it hurts when you swallow, the sore area may be high enough in your throat for gargling to bathe and soothe it, So gargle frequently with one of the solutions below. But be aware that if you're hoarse or have a cough, the sore spot is further down, and gargling won't help.<br>           Saltwater. Mix 1 teaspoon of table salt in 1 pint of warm or room-temperature water. That's just enough salt to mimic the body's natural saline content, so you'll find it very soothing. Use every hour or so, but don't swallow the liquid if you're concerned about your sodium intake.<br>  <br>  Increase your fluid intake. Taking in as much fluid as you can will help hydrate your parched throat tissues, Although it doesn't really matter what you drink, here are a few things you might want to avoid. Thick, milky drinks coat your throat and may produce mucus, making you cough and further irritating tissues; orange juice may burn an already inflamed throat; caffeine-containing beverages have a counterproductive diuretic effect.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	and then have a tablespoon of honey every 2 hours and tomorrow gargle with salt again and have some more honey.|`|cbTlfqc0aa	Gargle with salt water.

The good news is that many organizations can assist such individuals and they are not alone, in fact most people empathise with such people and truly would love to help if only such people simply reached out.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I don't think that an anorexic,lacking the necessary nutrients for strong bones, muscles and heart, would have the necessary energy to win a high energy fight, unless they had recently chewed some gum that was not sugarfree and the fight was no longer than 5min.  Similarly considering that bulimics typically have a system of binging and purging, it looks like both participants would pretty much collapse from physical exhaustion and plain lack of fitness.  However the bulimic has a slight edge over the anorexic as when a bulimic purges some food remains in their stomach as they only omit a percentage of all food consumed. Hence they would possibly have the energy to perhaps very feebly and slowly force the anorexic to the ground and sit on them for a bit.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, in response to another one of your qs concerning tampon usage.  It would be unsafe for you to attempt to squeeze more than one tampon into your orifice...particularly since your the wrong sex for this FEMININE hygeine product.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, Cheerio!

ufgv7oTjaa	Yes, I have. Acai is a fantastic antioxidant... but you're right that there are a lot of options out there, even though Acai is Acai as long as the company has good quality. I would be very wary of the sites that offer the free trials. Many of the "free offers" are either scamming because they aren't sending real Acai or canceling the plan after the "free trial" will be more than a pain. There have been so many members that have posted in this section that they have been ripped off by some of these companies (and some that think all companies that sell Acai are the same), so it's safest to just avoid the "free offers" if you want to try it out.<br>  <br>  Most health food stores carry smaller bottles of Acai for just a few dollars per bottle (a month's supply might be $5-10, depending on the dose and the company), but that would be more than enough to try it out.<br>  It is a great antioxidant and my personal experience with similar products is when my wife got sick while I was taking it and I didn't. Aside from that, whenever she got sick, so did I. Some people love the taste of this and some don't like it, so that's a matter of personal preference. Some people prefer to take capsules to avoid the taste issue and some prefer to mix the juice into other juices to cover the taste... it's up to you.<br>  Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|1fPyc1tqaa	Good answer from the "Oldtimekid".<br>  Yes Acai is good and you should follow his advise.
FwZyFTA0aa	It's probably due to the dry Winter air, and if you live in the mountains then it is also due to the high altitudes. I would say get a humidifier. It should make the air he breaths in moist and his nose will not be so dry.<br>  <br>  Also if he does blow his nose a lot I would suggest getting tissues with lotion on them. It will make his nose not chafe as much and not cause dry skin in the nostril with cause nose bleeds. <br>  <br>  He might also be a hemophiliac. That could be bad but I doubt that he is. He might have high-blood pressure too if it's not the dry thing. If the humidifier does not work take him to a doctor. <br>  <br>  Everybody gets a bad nose bleed every once in a while though, having them 3 to 4 times a week I would think is murder.

Nose bleeds are caused by a small blood vessel rupturing. There are two main types of nose bleed, upper and lower septum nose bleeds.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most nose bleeds occur within the lower end of the nose in the lower septum. The septum is the semi-rigid wall separating the two channels of the nose that contain blood vessels. These blood vessels lie close to the surface, making them susceptible to injury. Lower nose bleeds do not usually require medical attention unless the bleeding cannot be stopped or it happens in the very young. <br>  <br>  <br>  Causes of lower end nose bleeds<br>  The most common cause of nose bleeds is trauma. A blow, smack, or sometimes just picking the nose. Dryness inside of the nose can also cause bleeding. High altitudes, colds, allergies and medications are all responsible for nose bleeds.<br>  <br>  <br>  Treatment of lower end nose bleeds Sit up straight and pinch the nostrils together firmly for 10 minutes.<br>  You can place a cold compress or an ice pack across the bridge of your nose.<br>  Vaseline can be used if the cause of the nose bleed is dryness.<br>  When the bleeding stops do not jump up and down, take things easy, do not blow your nose or it will dislodge the clot and will probably start your nose bleed again.<br>  <br>  If a nose bleed does not stop after 10 to 20 minutes of direct pressure.<br>  <br>  More urgent medical attention is required if;<br>  <br>  <br>  the blood loss is heavy<br>  <br>  if you get nose bleeds often<br>  <br>  if the injury/trauma is severe<br>  <br>  The person is an infant or child, or if the person is already sick or elderly.<br>  <br>  If you are at all worried about the nose bleed seek further medical advice.<br>  Upper septum nose bleeds<br>  Upper septum nose bleeds are much more rare. Bleeding begins high within the nose and blood flows down the back of the mouth and throat even when the person is sitting up or standing. These nose bleeds can be very serious and do require urgent medical attention.<br>  <br>  Causes of upper septum nose bleeds<br>  <br>  <br>  High blood pressure<br>  <br>  Disease of the arteries such as atherosclerosis<br>  <br>  Side effects of medications and drugs such as aspirin, cocaine<br>  <br>  Bleeding disorders<br>  <br>  Nasal tumors, cancerous and non-cancerous<br>  <br>  Serious trauma such as a displaced broken nose from car crashes, falls etc<br>  <br>  Leukemia<br>  <br>  Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, a hereditary disease where a growth like a birth mark is located in the nose.<br>  <br>  Infection|`|p4Ss7TsIaa	I suggest you take him to the GP just in case, he may have low platelets (they help stop clog blood, e.g when you cut yourself).

Any slightest touch causes a spill of blood. Remember to have him lean forward, not back.

qWu5F1O2aa	I'm 6'3 and i have one stretch mark underneath each of my upper arms. Stretch marks occur in the dermis, the resilient middle layer that helps the skin retain its shape. No stretch marks will form as long as there is support within the dermis.  It is a common misconception that stretch marks are solely the result of the rapid stretching of the skin associated with rapid growth (common in puberty) or weight gain (e.g. pregnancy and/or muscle building) that overcomes the dermis's elasticity. Stretch marks are influenced by HORMONAL changes associated with puberty, pregnancy, muscle building etc. The glucocorticoid hormones, responsible for the development of stretch marks, affect the epidermis by preventing the fibroblasts from forming collagen and elastin fibers, necessary to keep rapidly growing skin taut. This creates a lack of supportive material, as the skin is stretched and leads to dermal and epidermal tearing. If the epidermis and the dermis have been penetrated, laser will not remove the stretch marks.  Unfortunateloy they can diminish in appearance over time but not disappear completely.|`|tSi10jneaa	No idea but sudden loss of weight and then sudden gain of weight must have caused it.|`|wKbRwH3haa	I'm female and developed stretch marks without losing or gaining any weight, I had been put on a medication that imbalanced my hormones, and this was a side effect, so maybe your hormones have changed somewhere along the line.|`|vJXZgEnOaa	Because when you were a teenager, you had a growth spurt and you grew so fast that the skin didn't have time to stretch resulting in stretch marks.

YFAPpzngaa	I too quit smoking.  In fact it was in 2001, and I smoked for a lot more years than you did.  You should be over the nicotine addiction by now, so my guess is that you need something to fill the void left by smoking the cigs.  You can try many many things.  I would visit those quit smoking sites all over the internet for hints and tips.<br>  <br>  When i quit, I also joined a gym, and working out took the place of the cigs.  You can try that also or chew gum when you feel that need to calm down.  Take up a new hobby.  There are many things you can do, but the one thing you don't want to do is go back to those things.  Just remember that every time you light up it's like making another mortgage payment on death.  You've gone over two months now. Keep up the great work!!
EWaRenHLaa	It really depends on where it hurts and what kind of hurt it is. Upper or lower, right or left. Is it a dull or sharp pain. Is it constant or comes in spurts. Does anything make it hurt worse or feel better. Try and be a little more specific, I'm sure you can get better help with more information. What ever it is, if it gets worse you may have to seek medical attention.

aEKI1Knqaa	You would most likely have to eat so much of it that it would make you sick. There are ways to get high through ingestion of THC but you have to extract the crystals from the plant material first. I don't know any weed recipes but, I'm sure you can find something on the internet on how to make weed brownies and cookies and such. If you are casually walking down the street while munching a cookie, nobody will suspect that you are actually getting high. Much more stealth. And you won't get a tummy ache either. Win win.|`|sVrkjixAaa	No, eating it plain is a waste of weed, same with snorting. To eat it it has to be heated and absorbed by fat in a food substance, such as butter or peanut butter.

It will give you a body stone, which feels good.  In fact some prefer to eat it (like in cookies or brownies, or even by itself) because it's a bit more mellow.  Just brush your teeth after, your breath still might smell.  Also, it takes more to get you high by eating it than smoking it.  Don't snort it!  You can't snort weed!|`|RYf3sf6Daa	yeah <br>  u can eat it plain or bake it into something like brownies or make a weed sandwich (which taste like ****) also dont bring a weed sandwich to school, i did that once and it make my locker and backpack smell, plus the weed was on my breath......<br>  <br>  i made potsta once and i used the pot as "seasoning" and it worked|`|XxhenzC0aa	Duh of course it does but it can also make you sick to ur stomach with will totally make you lose your high.|`|WLBSkvUIaa	if you eat it you really dont get high. you get a very good body buzz going on though

GvQHw4Ntaa	If you need an ultra absorbency tampon, it's fine to use them. Just make sure you change it about every three or four hours. If you're used to using super absorbency tampons, it shouldn't be much different. Ultra absorbency tampons are associated with a high risk for TSS because people might tend to leave them in longer, which gives bacteria a chance to grow in the tampon. Tampons aren't dangerous as long as you use the absorbency that's right for you... if you go through one in 4 hours, you're safe. Some girls don't even go through a regular tampon in four hours, so using ultra absorbency tampons would put them at risk for TSS. And it's always good to remember that there are only 12 cases of TSS in the US every year... it's very rare. Change your tampon on time and you'll be fine.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Hi. The way to use tampons is this: If you have a light flow, use the smallest size tampon. If you use a heavy flow tampon for a light flow, yes you can get TSS

This woman had come in via the emergency room with a very high random blood sugar of 1,380 mg/dl. She was then started on insulin during her hospitalization and was instructed on the use of a home glucometer. She was to use her glucometer two times per day. Two weeks later on her return office visit for a checkup of her insulin dependent diabetes she was informed that during her hospital physical examination she was noted to have FBD. She was recommended to start on 50 mg ofiodine(4 tablets) at that time. One week later she called us requesting to lower the level of insulin due to having problems with hypoglycemia. She was told to continue to drop her insulin levels as long as she was experiencing hypoglycemia and to monitor her blood sugars carefully with her glucometer. Four weeks later during an office visit her glucometer was downloaded to my office computer, which showed her to have an average random blood sugar of 98. I praised the patient for her diligent efforts to control her diet and her good work at keeping her sugars under control with the insulin. She then informed me that she had come off her insulin three weeks earlier and had not been taking any medications to lower her blood sugar. When asked what she felt the big change was, she felt that her diabetes was under better control due to the use of iodine. Two years later and 70 pounds lighter this patient continues to have excellent glucose control on iodine 50 mg per day. We since have done a study of twelve diabetics and in six cases we were able to wean all of these patients off of medications for their diabetes and were able to maintain a hemoglobin A1C of less than 5.8 with the average random blood sugar of less than 100. To this date these patients continue to have excellent control of their Type II diabetes. The range of daily iodine intake was from 50 mg to 100 mg per day. All diabetic patients were able to lower the total amount of medications necessary to control their diabetes. Two of the twelve patients were controlled with the use of iodine plus one medication. Two patients have control of diabetes with iodine plus two medications. One patient had control of her diabetes with three medications plus iodine 50 mg. The one insulin dependent diabetic was able to reduce the intake of Lantus insulin from 98 units to 44 units per day within a period of a few weeks.<br>  <br>  GOUT AND IODINE<br>  Google "Gout" and "Iodine" together and you should find a number of sites mentioning how gout can be caused by an iodine deficiency.<br>  <br>  Then get some Lugol's solution or Iodoral and take it.<br>  <br>  Foods rich in iodine <a href="http://www.weightlossforall.com/foods-rich-iodine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightlossforall.com/foods-ri...</a>|`|52cGZS3caa	No one here knows your medical requirements and any advice they give you could do more harm to you than good.

Np0Y3vUCaa	Unprotected anal sex can carry many risks, for both parties. Obviously fecal matter has the ability to enter the penis and cause problems. The lower GI and rectum have bacteria that are normal flora(harmless in that area) but are infectious in other parts of the body. The mucosa in sexual organs can become inflammed and infected from those bacteria. This can lead to urethritis(some unspecified) that will definitely cause burning urination. It wouldn't necessarily be considered an STD, but it could still be uncomfortable and should be treated. When having anal sex it is best to make preparations and among them a condom is a wise choice.|`|ntPUkeaNaa	A Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) happens to a lot of people. Less often for males, because its gotta travel up the penis to the bladder, and that's farther distance to travel that a female. If you take a piss after sex then you should be fine. It's no STD.|`|nF0Eaa2Gaa	Yes you can. You have to remember that there is bacteria inside the anus from fecal matter that's stored in the colon. If that stuff get's inside the penis or the vagina it can cause a lot of irritation or infection. That's why they tell females to wipe from the front to back. Leave the poop on the back door.
FgPZ8Sl8aa	There has never been a single case of marijuana causing lung cancer. In addition, a study done by a non-biased doctor (Dr. Donald Tashkin) has proven no cancer-marijuana link.<br>  <br>  As far as the testicular cancer bit goes. That is highly inconclusive (even admitted by them). It wasn't even a study, it was a survey of a small group of people. But since they were government funded they get to help support the propaganda efforts.<br>  <br>  Funny thing, when Taskin finds no link to marijuana use and cancer you still have to search for the headline, whereas this recent testicular cancer news was on every headline everywhere. <br>  Considering the percentage of people who smoke marijuana, and this "significant increase in developing testicular cancer" you'd think the amount of testicular cancer patients would increase significantly. However, testicular cancer is still generally uncommon.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Studies show smoking pot increases your (males) chances of developing a very rare, highly malignant testicular cancer by 70%. So, what do you think?|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Corey, Smoking marijuana, is dumb.|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	Smoking anything puts your esophagus and lungs at a much higher risk for developing the mutations that in turn lead to cancer.<br>  <br>  So the answer is yes.|`|52cGZS3caa	Listen to April.|`|jp3WrE1caa	yes|`|ZqZj0BRbaa	NO!<br>  <br>  To those saying putting smoke into your lungs causes cancer, you're wrong. Putting RADIOACTIVE smoke into your lungs causes cancer!!<br>  <br>  Cigarette smoke is radioactive, marijuana smoke is not. Tobacco is grown with a radioactive fertilizer with the chemical polonium 210.<br>  <br>  If someone tells you there are studies that say marijuana causes cancer, they're lying. There has not ever been one single study linking cancer to pot like there is with cigarettes. Every year at least one anti-drug foundation does a study that is always thrown all over the news that always says:<br>  There MAY be a POSSIBLE LINK between marijuana and cancer. <br>  <br>  They can only say this for two reasons. They don't have a single case, not one, of a heavy marijuana smoker only with no family history of lung cancer getting lung cancer. And that they can't do a study that will actually say that marijuana causes cancer becuase it doesn't.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the testicular cancer reply, I have to say this. That's utterly wrong. Get your facts before you start spouting crap. The study you're talking about is the one by thed Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle I presume. In that "study," which is actually an unscientific survey, 370 men with testicular cancer and 100 men without were asked if they smoked marijuana before. First off, a 370 person study is very unscientific and way too small to prove anything even if it was an actual scientific study. in the study(read: survey) 73% of the cancer patients had smoked marijuana and 68% of the non-cancer patents had smoked marijuana. First off that difference isn't significant at all in any scientific means. <br>  <br>  Then there is this fact. it's believed about 70% percent of people have smoked marijuana. The figure being about 70% in both groups then is absoultely not surpring, not alarming, and proves nothing.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that helped|`|LA2nJToYaa	Yes Cannabis contains tar in it just like tobacco and can lead to cancer cells forming anywhere in your body. In fact due to the fact that most Cannabis is smoked unfilterd it has a higher concentration of tar and carbon dioxide. If you are going to smoke get a vaporizer or a water bong its the best way to get rid of that bad tar.|`|lGakLKcWaa	they do contain carcenogines but nothing like the amount in cigarettes. far less likely to get cancer from dope.
Vdqmc0Lgaa	yeah time flies when youre watchin porn. i read this thing online that said guys who watch more porn than others tend to have less sex in real life than the ones who watch less porn. thats why i stopped. just delete it all if youve got any saved and you wont feel like watchin it anymore|`|bccT6SUpaa	you might have so much imaginations upon reading that stuff!<br>  avoid so much of it to avoid being tired after reading besides reading porno for boys like us is normal, avoid too much of it for it will lead you to be self-centered individual|`|AA10753168	I find sex in a real, loving relationship more satisfying than pictures and movies of perverts, druggies, and prostitutes.|`|5nmvSXr4aa	Nope.. if I feel really horny I just get my fix, and then it's done.  15 mins top.

It is your choice if you still want to look at porn.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	How long are you looking at porn?<br>  <br>  Looking at porn takes focus and concentration. Being aroused by looking at porn sends out pleasure hormones in the brain, similar to a hit of cocaine actually. But you're still using concentration and burning energy. So yeah its pretty common to feel tired after looking at porn for relatively long periods of time.|`|Og4Ab2dSaa	i use to love porn  but it just got boring and besides its just a waste of time and it make u look at woman in a bad way..so yeah|`|EGvVCpIxaa	i'm assuming you spank the monkey while watching it?

lcriDvMKaa	Hi i hate the taste of water also,Drinking lipton iced tea is just like drinking normal tea,it is to be drunk in moderation.Some of the flavoured teas provide u with antioxidants which is great whereas normal tea is a little worse for you.I wouldn't recommend you drink it every day because of the caffeine.Again drink in moderation.<br>  <br>  id recommend you use like barley drinks or lite low sugared cordial thats what i do to drink water.Even though water tastes horrid to u,using icecubes ad refrigerating it can make a big difference.<br>  <br>  You'll have to ask your doctor about the kidney stones,but you do need to try drink more water or youll become dehydrated and get headaches.
FicyC2TXaa	There is no guaranteed cure for any type of cancer.<br>  <br>  The problem with finding a 'cure for cancer' is that cancer is hundreds of diseases, not just one. The difficulty is that different cancers are caused by different things, so no one strategy can prevent them, and different cancers respond to different treatments so no one treatment can cure them all. There will never be a magic bullet that cures all cancer. <br>  <br>  Some cancers CAN be cured these days: 7 out of 10 children are cured of cancer. Testicular cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and many cases of leukaemia can all be cured in adults with chemotherapy, most skin cancers are cured with surgery, and many cases of thyroid cancer and cancer of the larynx are cured with radiotherapy.<br>  <br>  Many other types of cancer are also cured if they are found early enough. There is still a long way to go, especially with some of the commonest types of cancer such as lung, breast, bowel and prostate cancer.<br>  <br>  The idea that  a secret cure is being hidden, presumably  for reasons of profit, doesn't hold water. Think about it...<br>  <br>  If there were a hidden cure, thousands of people would have to have been cured by it (otherwise how would they know it worked?). All those people would  be keeping quiet about it too – not a word to the media from any of them either.<br>  <br>  I don't think it would be bursting anyone's bubble to hear that drug companies are in it for the money -  so why would they   be keeping quiet about this cure even though it would bring them fame and fortune? Any drug company discovering a cure would make far more money than they can have dreamed of making up till now.<br>  <br>  And doctors, scientists, researchers etc would be watching their relatives die and dying themselves (they and their families develop cancer at the same rate as the rest of the population) rather than  revealing the secret cure<br>  <br>  <br>  Most unlikely of all, every medical professional in the whole world would have agreed to keep existence of a cure secret. Every single one. One blabbermouth, one disgruntled researcher or sacked nurse and the whole conspiracy’s blown. Newspapers and other media wouldn't have got a sniff of it.<br>  <br>  I live in the UK; we don't pay for our medical treatment, including cancer treatment. Cancer treatment costs our government untold billiions - no fortunes being made there. Yet we have the same treatments as the rest of the world - no miracle cure has been revealed in order to save money.<br>  <br>  Existing treatments aren't perfect - very far from it. One day people will look back on them with horror. But they are all we have at the moment, and we know, because they have been tested and proven in double-blind clinical trials, that they save many lives and prolong many, many more.<br>  <br>  And the answerer above me is correct; anyone claiming they know of a cure for cancer is one three things - <br>  <br>  a) Deluded - they have read about some whacky alternative on the net and swallowed the unsubstantiated testimonials whole. They often mean well, but they know nothing about cancer. They so want to believe that they overlook the fact that 'alternative' in this context just means 'unproven'. If the treatment they advocate had been tested and proven to work, it would no longer be 'alternative medicine', it would just be 'medicine'.<br>  <br>  b) Lying<br>  <br>  c) After your money. Wherever there's cancer there's a ruthless charlatan eager to exploit the desperation of vulnerable people by taking their money in exchange for an ineffective and sometimes dangerous 'cure'. <br>  <br>  As for claims that cancer can be prevented (much less cured) through healthy living and eating - I wish it were true, but it's not. Cancer affects the healthy and the unhealthy aloke.<br>  <br>  I thought - when I thought about cancer at all - that my healthy, largely organic vegan diet, coupled with the facts that I have never smoked and I exercised regularly, would help protect me from cancer. Wrong - I got cancer anyway<br>  <br>  So, the answer to your question: There will never be a Eureka! moment when a single substance or procedure is discovered that will reverse all types of cancer. Rather there will be steady, sometimes slow, progress - an improved treatment here , a way to reverse one type of cancer there, a way to prolong more lives.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It would depend on the type of cancer.  Also, Because of the varying forms of cancer, finding a cure that could work for all forms of cancer is very unlikely.|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	There's no magic bullet pill here. Each kind of cancer arises from different genetic mutations that need to be addressed in order to effect any kind of cure. Certain types of cancer - chronic myeloid leukemia, for example - have had the faulty genes mapped out and a drug has been developed to compensate. The end result is essentially a cure (so long as that person is positive for the mutated gene and they tolerate the treatment well).<br>  <br>  Another tactic for stopping cancer has been drugs that target angiogenesis, which is the growth of new blood vessels. Angiogenesis is necessary for the tumor to grow and, eventually, for it to metastasize (spread to the rest of the body). The trick is differentiating between tumorigenic signals and healthy ones since angiogenesis is a normal, necessary process. As far as I know, nobody's been able to develop a drug that targets only tumorigenic signals.|`|52cGZS3caa	I'll try one more time! No reputable doctor will state he/she has a cure or has cured any form of cancer. There is always a chance of it returning after going into remission or being surgically removed. That said, there ARE good treatments available for all cancers with varying degrees of success depending on the type of cancer and how early it is caught. There have been rumors and conspiracy theories on the net since the beginning of the net. They are all hog wash and the folks hyping "miracle cures" are just making tons of money off of people with cancer that are desperate for any kind of hope. They are despicable; probably rich, but despicable and there is a special place in the afterlife waiting for them. If anyone DID have a cure, that person would be trumpeting it to the entire world. Just think of the fame that person would be accorded! Believe me, I sincerely wish there was such a cure - I'm like millions of other cancer patients, for now it's just a wish and a dream.<br>  <br>  Heck of an answer lo_mcg! That took a lot of thought and effort. Good luck with your cancer, I wish you the very best from Texas!|`|RVgQddmfaa	I've heard and read many success stories.  Have you heard of Anne Frahm?

sobrGyNYaa	There is no fast way to lose weight - unless you want to really make yourself sick, or kill yourself. <br>  <br>  Listen - don't freak out! It's not the end of the world. So, you've gained a few pounds. So what? Don't be so superficial. People who are worth anything won't judge you based on your weight. You don't sound like someone who's extremely overweight. <br>  <br>  Dieting doesn't work. All you have to do is eat healthy. Stop drinking sodas, stop eating junk food, stop eating dessert every night. You'll come to find that once you get used to not eating that kind of stuff, you stop craving it. Instead of eating candy, eat an apple or some low-fat yogurt. Instead of drinking a soda, drink some tea or juice. Instead of eating a hamburger, eat a turkey sandwich. If that pie or cake is calling your name, eat some nuts or just distract yourself with something else so that you forget about it. See where I'm going with this? Just lean how to make good food choices, and you don't have to worry about it.<br>  <br>  As far as exercising - run or do some cardio workouts 3 days a week and then lift some weights another 2 or 3 days a week. Exercise isn't good for just losing weight, it will make you feel better in all areas of your life. You'll have more energy, more confidence, less stress, and a healthier body. Sounds pretty good, right? Just make sure your cardio really gets your heart rate up, and you break a sweat. Light stuff like walking or yoga won't have as significant of an impact.|`|5nmvSXr4aa	There are no shortcuts|`|6WCftPIyaa	It is a possibility to lose weight quickly but you should be realistic and comprehend that if you lose weight rapidly then you will probably put it all back on again just as rapidly. The one diet that really worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials left, it was highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost twenty five pounds, it really does work!|`|87eb39c8c049174008d3c9bed257aa1aaa	Okay, there's two ways to think about losing weight:<br>  <br>  1) Lose weight fast, but the weight will likely come back fast.<br>  <br>  2) Lose weight slowly (3 - 8 lbs monthly), and IF the weight comes back at all, it will be slow.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to go the route of #1, low carb diets like Atkins will make you lose the most weight the quickest. Other diets promising quick weight loss will also probably work, but they all work mainly because you lose water weight (which can come back very quickly).<br>  <br>  If you want to go the route of #2, you'll need to find a diet more balanced (E.g. The Zone, Eating for Life, 5 Factor Diet, Eat Clean Diet) and do regular, challenging exercises.<br>  <br>  The more calories you can burn with exercise, the better. Generally, anything that gets your heart beating really fast and your breathing really heavy is burning alot of calories. (E.g. jogging, stair climbing, swimming laps, cycling, etc)<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful.|`|DYa60yl2aa	that is the fast routine.<br>  it takes work.<br>  If it didnt take hard work, people with nice bodies wouldnt be admired so much.
WJWW7NXaaa	Yeah this is normal, one of the more unpleasant side effect of migraine. <br>  <br>  Ask your pharmacist to recommend a good combination of a painkiller and an anti nausea medicine. I was told to take my regular pain killers with Motilium. <br>  <br>  You could also look into getting a tablet called Migraleve, I have found these to be amazing when taken at the first sign of migraine.

Its so strange, because you feel the root breaking, but you feel so good about it, I had happy gas, numbing cream and novocaine injections and I was just like, "you can cut my leg off if you want!"  I actually enjoyed the feeling.|`|56c0d46a45f9b0690017a28ae0651b65aa	I will tell you when they get you in the chair they will rub some numbing stuff on your gums and then give you some shots of lido cane that will numb you so you don't feel what they are doing after they are done they will give you pain meds for after it will ache but the meds will help if its a surgical extraction you will not feel a thing they will put you to sleep but it will ache after but again they will give you meds|`|AA11132138	Be sure to communicate with your dentist really well. Every one requires a different amount of medication to reach the level of numbness needed for the work being done. You may find that after the first shot he will allow you a little time for it to work and when he comes to check if your numb, you may be ready to go or you may need more medication administereed. In the event you receive more then he will allow a little time and check again. You are his only way of knowing whats going on so dont be afraid to let him know if anything at all hurts. I have had so much dental work in my life and I never react the same to the numbing. Sometimes its one shot and ive taken way over an hour before of adding dose after dose before i was ready. Be prepared to experience lots of pressure and what seems like very ruff work going on in your mouth. It is scary the first time you ever experience it if you were not made aware of the fact that it will be going on. As much as no one can possible enjoy this process it is in no way painful. scary? Yes! Unpleasant? ABSOLUTLY but i promise you that the feelings are nothing remotly close to painful if you are numbed right. If at anytime you feel pain as he is working be sure to let him know right then. Any good dentist will immediatly do what needs to be done inorder to numb what ever area you felt something more than the pressure and working around going on. Somepeople (I used to be one myself) are more afraid of the needle that is used to make sure you dont feel the surgery than anything that may go on if they were not to receive anything to kill the pain. If this is something you are experiencing as well I understand this completly and it took me along time to actually realize it, i was so scared of needles no one could convince me it didnt hurt to get that needle and that I was crazy to not want it and to go thru it reguardless of the pain just so i didnt have to get that needle. I promise you as well that no one can sit here and tell you that it wont hurt. I know that it depends on the person giving the needle. There are dentist out there who have absolutly no care at all what their patient feels and these dentist, although rare are real jerks however the medication in the needle is to numb you so the worst you will experience here is a simple poke from the first needle and only the first. he will stick the needle in several different places to inject the medication but almost as soon as the very first time is over youy are numb enough that you do not feel the rest of the injections. This is your worse case scenerio and I am only telling you incase you dont have a dentist who seems human. (LOL) Let your dentist know of your fear, he is used to this and hears it every day. The best dentists out there do this thing where they hold your cheek/ lips with one hand and shakes your face almost like a vibrating motion. while he is doing this he uses the other hand to administer the needle. I am imprested every time with what this actually does. If your dentist does this and knows what he is doing you will not only not feel the tiniest prick from a needle but you literally couldnt even tell him at what point he sticks you even the first time. You truely not only are not exposed to any pain period, you dont feel him touch you. this always amazes me.<br>  Well, i think if i didnt put you to sleep i definatly should have you prepared and knowing what to expect. I hope this helps. After the work is done and you leave eventually the anesthesia will slowly wear off and if you are gonna experience any soreness you will know then. You may never be bothered but if your sour just make sure to take some acetametaphen or what ever you use right away and stay on top of it. Dont wait  till its unbearable to take something. you wont get full relief this way. if you take it on a 4-6 hour scheduale you keep it at bay and your entire experience will be one of nothing painful. GOOD LUCK!|`|lUvd3ZyXaa	No it is not a painful procedure.

YCmvBc05aa	Sorry that it happened to your husband. <br>  <br>  Though it is rare, black eye CAN develop after a dental visit.<br>  <br>  Since he got his top teeth taken out, I am assuming some of those teeth were in the front as well. On rare occasions, the injection administered to get the Anterior Superior Alveolar Nerve (roughly below the eye) can cause localized bleeding that manifests itself as the black eye a day or two later.<br>  <br>  Rest assured, though the condition looks serious and alarming, it DOES NOT imply an infection. It will clear up in due course of time. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, with his current medical condition nothing should be overlooked. You should definitely call the doctor to get advice to get the peace of mind. <br>  <br>  I am sure the dentist will say the same thing.

mAQHyfCYaa	Where did you get it pierced? At and actual shop or somewhere like claire's? What was used? A needle or a gun? What kind of jewelery was put in? What did you do to clean it?<br>  <br>  I have 15 piercings uncluding my nose, all have healed successfully without problems. So here's what I know.<br>  <br>  If you got it pierced with a gun then that is a blunt force that can shatter the cartilage somewhat, which will cause it to reject the jewelery and form scaring. A needle is best for any piercing. It's also more hygienic because guns can't be properly sanitized.<br>  <br>  So if the jewelery quality was low it may have contained things like nickel or other cheap metals. Your body hates this and will try to push it out, so it could have been the cause of the bump. Claire's and places like this often have cheap jewelry, so even if you were pierced with good quality jewelery and then switched it to a lower quality your body will still react.<br>  <br>  And cleaning it is simple. Leave it alone, and just rinse it lightly in the shower with hot running water. No soap, no alcohol, no peroxide. All of these will dry out your piercing and irritate it and not allow it to heal properly.<br>  <br>  Also, without pain, heat and a greenish-yellowish pus it wasn't infected. However, if it ever did become infected removing the jewelery isn't the best option is to leave it in. Piercings will heal from the outside in. If it was infected then the piercing would start to heal and trap the infection inside, causing an abcess, which is worse then the bump.<br>  <br>  Anyway, my best advice is to go to a reputable piercing shop and get it pierced there. The piercers know what they are doing and will do it the best way possible for you.|`|3zl6DrjVaa	pimple, my older sis had the same thing|`|4o9CxQOLaa	"The bump" which you got is very common in nose piercings and are caused by irritation.<br>  What you should have done, is put a spot of tea tree oil on it once and day and try to leave it alone as much as possible.<br>  <br>  If you want it pierced again, I'd recommend you going to a piercers that use a needle (NOT a gun!) and who can pierce it with titanium jewellery. Titanium is well known and not many people get a reaction from it.|`|mQhsPWkJaa	couldve been due to the metal go with silver not as many are allergic and it also couldve been your own doing lack of proper care of the piercing  or it couldve been caused from the piercer using unclean materials to do it just get it redone and you should be fine if it does it again take it out and jus get something else pierced|`|MCiSrm2Vaa	i don't think u are allergic to metal....because when i got my ear pierced one of the ears were fine and the other one got the same thing as u are explaining so i believe its not allergy to metal its just that i got infected...but mine was not that bad i just took out the earring and kept cleaning it with rubbing alcohol and avoided it to come in contact with water and it healed in a few weeks. mine had got pus as well though. well next time try piercing with a gold jewelery u should not be allergic to gold.  no one is ......hehehehe|`|VdHTl3MLaa	duude, the SAME exact thing happened to me :-o!!!!!<br>  umm...<br>  i really wanna get mine re-done also, but i'm not sure i want to.<br>  i talked to this guy who knew a thing or two about piercings.<br>  my nose was pierced kind of high up, and the guy says it had something to do with blood not getting through to the piercing, so it would never completely heal up.. i had also gotten a scab on the outside of my nose too. oober-gross, yes it was.. about the bump? i had the same problem... i popped it, and white oozey stuff came out, just like a zit, but afterwards it got even b i g g e r. being allergic to the metal makes since, so if you're gonna get it re-pierced, try one of those plastic nose rings. they're cute, and inexpensive. i'm gonna do the same thing :) hope that helped :)|`|FCmuA1KEaa	I have my nose pierced and have never had that.

Do you have any idea who the girl is?? Do you remember anything from the party?? Are you positive it was a girl you had sex with?? These are things you need to be asking yourself. Second: If you did happen to get a girl pregnant then you can do one of two things. First you can tell her the truth, that you don't remember what happened at all, and go through with the kid. Or you can run like most men do. Sorry, I know too many guys that just high tail it out of there at the first sign of a baby. I really do hope that every thing turns out good for you though.

sKTmxnx1aa	The best thing you could do is wait a week or so, then take another pregnancy test.  If it comes back negative again, then you should see the doctor.  Hope this helps, and hope you feel better soon!|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	Pregnancy IS kind of an infection, lol!<br>  <br>  Think for a minute.  What is the morning after pill?  It's hormones.  What do hormones do?  regulate periods, moods, etc.  What happens when you mess with your hormones (like with the morning after pill)?  Your body (and mind) go a little nutty.  Spotting, mood swings, etc are all normal.  <br>  <br>  The tricky fact is that pregnancy and menstruation feel and have similar symptoms.  Just so you know, morning sickness doesn't usually start until you're six to eight weeks pregnant.  The urge to pee all the time doesn't start until the fourth month.<br>  <br>  Chances are more likely that the morning after pill messed up your cycle, which is throwing everything else off, too.  I'm 28 and I have taken the morning after pill several times.  I don't do well on birth control pills, so I tend to have a bad reaction to Plan B, too.  It throws off my natural cycle, I get spotting, brown discharge, I feel a little sick, I don't sleep well, and my moods are unpredictable.  You know you're being irrationally moody when you get so frustrated that you cry because a light turned red when you're running a little late to work, lol!<br>  <br>  I've also been pregnant.  It was unlike anything I'd ever felt before.  I had an abortion, by the way.  After that, I had a non-hormonal IUD inserted.  They don't recommend it for women who have never had children... because it hurts like HELL for the first two weeks.  Then it hurts enough to be annoying for another three months.  It's great, though, because I don't have to worry about getting pregnant for 10 years AND it doesn't have hormones, so I don't go batty.  <br>  <br>  The ParaGuard IUD was the last resort.  You need to start thinking about other forms of birth control.  When I got pregnant, I was using condoms AND spermicide foam.  No method is 100%...  except the ParaGuard IUD is more effective than birth control, condoms, etc.|`|dy9C5kYkaa	I think that would be an infection. After taking a pill that should not be happened. Either the pill is expired or anything can happen. you must watch this for 2-3 days and if the condition wont changed you should immediately go to the doctor and tell the doctor the whole story.

6e8a2562119ae10db7789da7710dfe93aa	A sore throat, as someone pointed out, can be caused by many things. Exposure to HIV can cause a sore throat, sometimes really bad, but not necessarily. <br>  <br>  From site below: "After first being infected, a person may have no symptoms for a long time. Sometimes they'll get what they may think of as just some kind of "flu". Such symptoms tend to be a fever, headache, a rash, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands. Since, if they get these "flu"-type symptoms, they'll usually happen between two to six weeks after they actually get infected, most people would not connect what they think is a regular "flu", to being infected with HIV. "<br>  <br>  After all that, the odds of HIV being a factor here are extraordinarily low. One of you'd have to have been exposed- presumably you, or her with another partner, for her to get an HIV related sore throat recently. The info you've given us doesn't indicate that is possible, if that information is true.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I'd suggest that at 15, it might be better for both of you to cool down the sex and embrace your emotions and feeling safe with each other, at least for a while. Sex will always be available to you when you are a bit older and can handle possible consequences a little easier.|`|HugRTUPsaa	You've got very little to worry about. The major transmission routes are drug abuse, especially IV drug abuse, and unprotected sex, and if you're each other's first partners, you are unlikely to be at risk. <br>  <br>  You mention nothing about drugs, so assuming you're both sensible, which going by your use of condoms you sound to be, there really isn't anything to worry about.|`|AA11626362	It's unlikely she has HIV, you've been protected and I'm assuming you dont have it so unless she's cheated with someone that has it... she won't have it... but it can also take up to 6 months for the disease to show up in tests so keep a regular schedule about getting tested (both of you) and do the tests not only for HIV but all other diseases too... early recognition is VERY VERY important for any disease!  Anyway, stay calm and just wait for the results, it's most likely negative.|`|hBmafVYoaa	HIV is not just contracted by sexual intercourse. Have a look at it on google or wikipedia. Rarely children can contract it from their mother if she had a HIV+ status, but this is very rare now due to good medical care.<br>  It would seem unlikely.|`|HMgRFOhqaa	Just a quick one?  it's the 'quick one's' that cause most of the HIV's..|`|AA11461005	HIV is not just limited to sexual intercourse. For example if your girlfriend had an open cut that was exposed to blood that was HIV+ there's a chance she could've gotten it, if she shot up and used someone elses needle and they were HIV+ she could've gotten it. The list goes on and on, but if she's been safe and hasn't done any of that, and neither have you it was probably just a sore throat :)|`|oenwiCepaa	sore throat means less than AIDS.   Strep, cold etcetera.  If you had AIDS one of your lymph glands would swell so bad you would be in major pain.  If however you were in the early stages of HIV  nothing would show.

AA11522944	If the doctor has already said it is a cyst you are probably fine but if you want or need a second opinion go for it.<br>  <br>  Sometimes when guys think they feel a ‘lump’ on their testes they are actually feeling their epididymis – which is a coil of tubes that store the sperm in their testicles. The epididymis will feel soft and ‘squishy’.<br>  <br>  See the link below which shows where the epididymis is.<br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/misc/movie/bodybasics/male_repro.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/misc/movie/bodybas...</a><br>  <br>  Guys should conduct regular self-examinations of their testicles so that they are familiar with their normal shape and size and detect any unusual changes which might indicate a problem.<br>  <br>  Generally the testes should feel firm and smooth. If you feel any hard lumps - anywhere from the size of a grain of rice to the size of a pea – you should see a doctor. Hard lumps in either testis could be a symptom of testicular cancer. While testicular cancer is rare in teenager boys overall it is the most common cancer in males between the ages of 15 and 35.<br>  <br>  Is a lump in the testis always cancer??<br>  <br>  There are other lumps that can be found in the testis that can be non-cancerous. It is important to see a doctor to make sure any lumps felt are not testicular cancer. An ultrasound examination of the testis can find out what type of lump it is. The main types of non-cancerous lumps are:<br>  <br>  Epididymal cyst<br>  Epididymal cysts are fluid-filled cysts that come from the epididymis, and are very common. Often discovered when about the size of a pea, they feel slightly separate from the top of the testis. These lumps can slowly increase in size and can feel like a third testis. Epididymal cysts can happen at any age and should be left alone when still small, but can be removed with surgery if they become larger. <br>  <br>  Spermatocele<br>  Spermatocele are similar to epididymal cysts. The only differences are that the lump is usually connected to the testis, and the swelling is filled with fluid containing sperm and sperm-like cells. <br>  <br>  Hydatid of Morgagni<br>  Found at the top of the testis, a Hydatid of Morgagni is a small cyst that is separate from the epididymis and sometimes found on a thin strand of tissue. These common cysts are moveable and can cause pain if they twist. There is no risk of cancer from these cysts, and unless they are causing pain, should be left alone. <br>  <br>  Who should I see for help?<br>  If you notice a hard lump or any change in your testes you should see a local doctor straight away. The local doctor may then give a referral to a specialist (urologist). A urologist deals specifically with problems in the genital and urinary tracts of both men and women.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below<br>  <a href="http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/pageContent.asp?pageCode=TESTICULARLUMPS" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/pageCo...</a><br>  <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/testicle-lump/overview.html" rel="nofollow">http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/...</a><br>  <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/scrotal-masses/overview.html" rel="nofollow">http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/testicular_disorders/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/testicular_di...</a><br>  <br>  The links below describe how to ‘self-examine’ and what you should be looking for:<br>  <a href="http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/library/TesticlarCancerFactSheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/librar...</a><br>  <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/testicular-self-examination/overview.html" rel="nofollow">http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/guys/tse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_he...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/pageContent.asp?pageCode=TESTICULARCANCER" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/pageCo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Testicular_cancer?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2...</a>|`|QX0PfX4Daa	yep, your balls will turn blue and fall off<br>  <br>  <br>  seriously, a qualified dr has examined you so how will random people on here be able to help you?|`|63bad0287364f42fcb1f15fc1fcea2a0aa	Dash has a great answer.

RvSHQtrXaa	You did not give sufficient details, age, female, and other vital information that may help me to diagnose your abdominal pain.<br>  <br>  If you are a teenager or upper years, abdominal pain sometimes are from menstruation periods.  Abdominal pain, and cramps during this time can be as a result of fibroids on your uterus.  It can also be colicky in nature as well, depending on the food you eat, its quantity and the mix.  As your colon as residues of food that may toxic in nature, not to kill you, but those that lingers for a period and not excreted.  You can try some mild laxative, Dulcolax or olive oil.  Please eat a lot of vegetables and drink a lot of water, so that you can rid yourself of these waste.  <br>  <br>  If your belly continue in discomfort, see your doctor, if it is so acute, you may need a barium enema, so that the radiologist can take pictures with a x-ray machine and follow-through on your colon.  <br>  <br>  Most times people get relieve after a barium enema, because the wash outs for a clean colon to do the procedure relieve the pain as toxic foods rid the body.<br>  <br>  Do not fret, if your pain continues, just see your doctor and tell him about what I say to you and what type of treatment I suggest.  God's healing hands on you, bye!!|`|BhlGe0A8aa	Need much more info-elaborate please!|`|68l1TeDjaa	alot of things could cause it. be more specific. what are the pains like?

ov7BmlTcaa	Bruised muscles need to be taken care of properly,  especially if it's in the thigh.  If you put too much stress on the area too soon you can risk tearing the muscle or developing myositis ossificans in which the bruise becomes hard and calcified.  When it gets to that point, you would require surgery to remove the hardened area.  <br>  <br>  If you are still having pain, you should not be playing.  Also you should be icing your thigh while stretching as this will help prevent the calcification.

(Don't use Grade A maple syrup or maple-flavored syrup. They are over-refined, which means that they are mostly refined sugars and lack essential minerals.) A small pinch of cayenne pepper (to taste). Spring or purified water, between room temperature and medium hot (but not cold) – fill to 1/4 liter (8 oz). Mix all the ingredients by thoroughly stirring or shaking, and drink. Or, in two 1 liter bottles: Juice of 3 lemons, divided equally between the two bottles (about 85ccm or 3 oz per bottle) An equal quantity of grade B or C maple syrup in each bottle (about 85 ccm or 3 oz per bottle) A pinch of cayenne in each bottle Spring or purified water (fill bottles to the top) Mix all the ingredients by thoroughly shaking; then drink throughout the day. Use fresh lemons or limes only, never canned or frozen lemon juice. Use organic and vine ripened when possible. Also, mix your lemonade fresh just before drinking. Don't mix it up in the morning for the whole day. You can, however, squeeze your lemons in the morning and measure out the 2 tablespoons when needed.<br>  * YL Clinic says you can use Agave instead of the maple syrup. Tom Woloshyn (who studied with Stanley Burroughs himself) disagrees. Clinic says if you have diabetes or hypoglycemia, use molasses. If you feel weak or have a sugar imbalance you can add a scoop of Power Meal. Or you can try Master Amino Acid Profile (MAP) for protein without any residuals or strain on the body  more info here: http:/www.weightlossessentials.com/amino...<br>  <br>  SALT WATER FLUSH: <br>  Drink an oral salt water enema upon arising. To do this, add 2 level teaspoons of uniodized sea salt to a quart of lukewarm water (the one-quart juice bottles in which most organic juices come work very well). Shake well, then drink the entire quart. It's also good to massage the colon as well. Make sure you use uniodized sea salt; regular or iodized salt will not have the same beneficial effect. This oral enema will flush out your entire digestive tract and colon from top to bottom, usually within an hour, prompting you to eliminate several times, clearing out the plaque and debris from the walls, and the parasites that have been living there.<br>  <br>  Lemonade Drink: <br>  Drink the lemonade mix every 1 to 2 hours. Take no other food, but do be sure to drink plenty of purified water in addition to the lemonade drink. Drink as much of this lemonade as you want, but make sure that you drink at least twelve 1/4 liter (8 oz) glasses. The lemonade contains all the vitamins and minerals you need. This can be combined with supplements for colon cleansing such as Bentonite or Psyllium Seeds. You don't have to start your fast on the morning of the first day. You can begin later in the day, even if you've already eaten. Once you begin, however, eat nothing more while you're on the fast. It's also a good idea to read Stanley Burrough's book, The Master Cleanser. Note: Diabetics, refer to the special instructions on page 19 of The Master Cleanser.<br>  <br>  Note: Bentonite is the only product known to remove plaque from the walls of the intestine and colon. The plaque in your stool will look like egg shells on the outside of the bentonite "gel." Bentonite works most effectively when the colon is empty of food. It grabs the plaque which has been loosened by the lemon juice and the resting/fasting process. The salt water enema pushes out the bentonite gel and the plaque and debris that is stuck to it and in it. The salt water further cleanses the walls as it passes through, resulting in shiny clean walls.<br>  <br>  Herbal Laxative: <br>  Each evening you can drink an herbal laxative tea to help with elimination, do this right before bed time.<br>  <br>  GOING OFF LEMONADE FAST <br>  Burroughs recommends a minimum of 10 days on this. You can safely do 40 days or more. <br>  First Day: Start with 4 oz. [1/8 liter] fresh squeezed orange juice mixed with 4 oz. water. If it goes well, drink several more 8 oz. [1/4 liter] glasses of fresh orange juice during the day. Sip slowly. Dilute with water if needed. <br>  Second Day: Drink several 8 oz. [1/4 liter] glasses of orange juice during the day -- with extra water, if|`|wnVGeG8uaa	Your not overweight, I am also 5'5 and my goal weight is 135lbs.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.

cPRuJQ1Paa	I had my gastric bypass surgery through Forerunners Healthcare Consultants in India I don't regret it at all I had a baby since then and I'm still able to take the weight off so far i am very happy. The key is to use a reputable surgeon. You want to be carefully screened beforehand to make sure you are a good candidate. Since my surgery I can walk without getting tired, I can play with my son; I can walk down the street with my head held high. I feel pretty for the fist time in years. I was given another shot at life. The surgery is a tool and how well that tool works is up to you!!<br>  <br>  I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would recommend to every one who is suffering from the same problems as I did before but I would urge anyone who is interested to seek the best surgeon possible and make the decision based on the surgeon’s recommendations and your own personal goals!! Make sure the reasons for the surgery are the right one. The surgery isn't for someone who just "wants to be skinny". Do it for your health, for your life, for family. FOR YOU.<br>  <br>  You can checkout their website.<br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11315360	The surgery is more of a mental fix than a real physical one. <br>  What happens is that they surgically make your stomach smaller and you have to eat small fist size meals several times a day. Meaning each bite since you only get a fist size needs to be healthy foods only.<br>  <br>  The danger is that you could die in surgery OR many people overeat one day and have died because their stomach couldnt handle all the food after surgery.<br>  <br>  If you pretend like you already had the surgery (even though you havent) and eat small healthy meals several times a day, your stomach with NATURALLY shrink. And you will feel fuller faster. You also have to exercise like Oprah has to. And you could drink 1 glass of water before a meal to get fuller faster.<br>  <br>  And if you ever overeat one day you dont have to worry about dying from spliting your stomach open, because you never got the surgery.<br>  <br>  They surgery was created as a mental fix for people. You can shrink your stomach by eating little meals several times a day and acting like you already had the surgery, without the actual surgery. Which is SAFER!|`|cU17Ytrkaa	The previous poster is an idiot.<br>  <br>  It is not a mental fix.  Yes your stomach is reduced but your intestines are also bypassed (the reason why bypass is in the name).  You have malabsorbtion.  You do not absorb what you eat when you do eat which is why you have to take a lot of vitamins and protein shakes.  Malabsorbtion is not mental, its one of the main reasons why people that have had the surgery loose so much weight.  Compare people who have the surgery without malabsorbtion and only stomach altering (the lap band).  They loose about 1/3 of the weight as those that have gastric bypass.   <br>  <br>  Not only does your tiny stomach make you only able to eat small amounts of food but there are also certain types of foods you cant eat or you will get sick.  It forces you to change your eating habits.  <br>  <br>   It is a big decision, for me it was worth and I would do it again.  Mine was covered completely by my insurance.  See your Primary Care Doc and get a referral to a surgeon. <br>  <br>  The risks of the surgery are of that of any surgery no more, no less.  As long as you take care of yourself afterwards (taking vitamins and protein shakes) most people do fine afterwards.

VGOACuKGaa	you should look fine|`|K4GiKOhPaa	The smaller the frame, the thinner the lenses. Anti-reflective coating is very easy to scratch. You need to be extremely careful with them and carry special wipes. Rimless is not recommended. Are your lenses spherical or with cylinder? That also affects the thickness.|`|un0C52G8aa	You can get them. My prescription is just about as bad and I have a pair of semi-rimless glasses. Just make sure you get the high index feature so they look reasonably normal.|`|lsv1edQVaa	That Rx. is right at the cut off for those types of frames. If you are going to do that I would definitely go to a private eyeglass shop that is able to order you the very best in eyeglass options. Also deal with someone that is experienced and will make sure that the fit of your frame is perfect. You need to make sure your eyes are very central in the frame for the best lens thickness. And non-glare coating is a must with an Rx that high. Even if it scratches easier you will want it|`|e5434222d982e9110f1579a6840d315faa	no. get black plastic frames. those are always the sexiest. i know someone who has -8 vision and she has black plastic frames and doesn't have a problem with them.
ngDjTbTnaa	Ok don't get mad please but can it be that you are pregnant? If not I would go to a doctor cause you might have something changing in your brain. Maybe you are very stressed out and your body is trying to tell you to calm down and get a break. Make sure your room walls has no molding or anything like that. Get yourself checked out.

It's harder to lose than to gain so don't gain if you can help it.|`|K8mKH21zaa	Yes.  One of those heavy packages of sugar is 5 pounds.

Also, at 6 weeks do not expect it to be like brand spanking new. That takes time. <br>  <br>  Another thing to remember for an older person is that even after healing, it may hurt on cold/damp days,

Either doctor has a drug representative giving a lot of freebee that he/she became a fan (or obligated to RX) or thinks he/she can impress the patient with fancy antibiotics that's super expensive.<br>  <br>  If you are sick of taking them, let your dentist know. Antibiotic like amoxicillin or penecillin derivative will work. If you are allergic, there are other generic option. <br>  <br>  Antibiotic will not remove abcess, but it will control spreading of infection and reduce swelling. <br>  <br>  Hopefully you will take the tooth out ASAP. and Yes, tooth abcess is bacterial infection.

ySB6dZYlaa	exercise is the best diet, but low carbs and 5 to 6 small meals speed up the metabolism.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	You can use dietary fiber as sources of carbs, and kill two birds with one stone. Just cut out a lot of the other carbs.|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Try these, The rapid success of the Scarsdale diet with a very low calorie diet that have per day only contains about 1000 calories. In addition, almost entirely on carbohydrates waived, even fat is only consumed in small quantities. The resulting diet is protein. This ensures fast food customers consequence, at least on the scale.|`|JOoqy9doaa	I would stick to a good regiment of healthy eating and the right amount of exercise. Fad diets work in the short term but not for long. Monitor your calories, get a good mix of complex carbs, fiber, protien and eat veggies. If you want t keep weight off you have to train your body to digest and increase metabolism. This means eating right in the morning day and night. Also, when you exercise, don't kill your body by over doing it. Dontfall into fad traps! I'm sure you've heard it before but eating healthy and exercising consistently is the best way to lose weight  and keep it off|`|PdY9ylZCaa	actually, it really doesn't matter so long as you reduce your calories and get at least 90mins of exercise daily|`|i5BQ8mT6aa	try not eating so much, there's a diet that should work|`|Xp5lgKWOaa	Diets have come and gone and a new one will be invented tomorrow promising you everything and delivering very little. That is because they are considered something you go on and then go off. In other words, they are temporary. That is not to say they are useless just that they will never give you continued success unless you change some things permanently.<br>  <br>  What is a Diet Good for?<br>  <br>  Diets have their place in your weight loss goals. First of all, they can be beneficial to jump starting your metabolism. Kind of a fire starter if you will. A jump-start will give you more energy and the initial weight loss can boost your self-confidence.<br>  <br>  However, you will need to be ready to make some whole life changes if you want the results to be permanent. What are some changes you will need to make? Well a lot of that depends on you.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle Changes- Fast Food<br>  <br>  Are you a fast food junkie who eats out at least a couple of times per week? If so, you will find that you have plenty of company. Many people are so busy that the drive through is a perfect solution for dinner, lunch and even breakfast. The problem is many have no idea that one meal from a fast food restaurant can contain nearly a whole day's caloric intake.<br>  <br>  One popular fast food joint has a burger that is 750 calories! The burger alone is a third of your recommended daily allowance; add the fries and a drink and you are done for the day.<br>  <br>  Does this mean you can never have fast food again? Not necessarily, but it will mean that you have to be aware of what you are eating. Most fast food places have a website that contains all the nutritional information for the foods they serve. Check them out then make you a list of "safe" fast foods.<br>  <br>  Exercise Changes<br>  <br>  If you never move your body more than from the house to the car to work and back you will have a hard time losing weight and keeping it off. The human body functions best when there are periods of exercise. It increases mood stabilizers in the blood stream and best of all burns calories.<br>  <br>  While you are on your diet, take the time to incorporate exercise into your life. You will feel better and increase your weight loss rates exponentially. Start with a walk, park further away from the store or your office. Then as you progress, find time to walk more or jog. Whatever you can comfortably fit in your schedule will be a great place to start.<br>  <br>  Healthy Eating<br>  <br>  This is absolutely the most important part of all. While you are on your chosen diet, you will want to become familiar with healthier food choices. Find ways to make your favorite foods better for you. Can you substitute ground turkey for ground beef in some recipes? Learn new recipes that include fresh fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You see your body needs several things to function at a healthy level. Proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals just to name a few. You also need certain fats to cushion joints and protect your vital organs. Create a lifestyle eating plan that brings all of these elements into play and you will feel amazing and best of all you will be able to lose weight and keep it off.<br>  <br>  Check out my source, it might help a bit.

Try cutting out precessed foods, or sugars, or soda, or bread, Anything really. Mind your portion sizes, and types of food you eat.

Z4PxfObXaa	Next time, just use a lighter ball.|`|CviQ3Ckwaa	No, there is nothing to worry about. It is probably just stressed because you arent accustomed to that amount of weight on your hand. You might have strained it or pulled something so dont worry. If you are worried you can go visit a professional.|`|574eb859c301df997d80bbd93890321faa	You probably overexerted yourself. Your body was most likely not used to the movements of bowling and having to bear the weight of a heavy bowling ball. If it helps, apply some ice to keep any inflammation down. It should feel better in a few days to a couple weeks- depending on the severity. There's no need to worry, it sounds like you've just pulled a muscle.|`|gVOeroPeaa	lol, all i saw was "so i went bowling today..."<br>  <br>  and i looked at the catagories and saw "injuries"<br>  <br>  ahh, how i lol'd<br>  <br>  and have you never worked out? lol, you feel tired the day after doing anything physically strenuous. sectsual activities included.|`|Jz8S4wrfaa	Yeah that happens to me a lot too. Those muscles just aren't use to working as hard as they do when you bowl, it should go away in a couple of days, but if it continues then you may want to see a physician as you might of pulled a muscle. :D|`|ZSlaNKEkaa	its normal dont worry|`|3u3zSqZWaa	The hand span on the ball you used was probably a little to much for you.  The stretch you had from the thumb hole and your middle finger and your index finger holes was probably to much.  Between the thumb and the two fingers really shouldn't be a stretch.  With your thumb in the thumb hole and the rest of your hand flat on the ball, the start of the other two holes should be at the bend of the knuckle on middle and index fingers.  But it's also not unusual for your hand to be sore or maybe even crap up when stretched after bowling from gripping the bowl hard.  Absolutely nothing to worry about.  The more times you bowl the less it will get sore.|`|atFiOTMbaa	Absolutely nothing to worry about here.  Maybe if you want to try icing your hand and forearm to relieve any stress.  Next time you might want to consider using a lighter ball and build up the weight as necessary.|`|HHYHlpzHaa	you'll be fine. it's because you haven't bowled.. your fingers are just sore. if it doesn't clear up within a couple days ( it should) then you can go get it checked out by your doctor. but it's nothing serious :) hope you feel better!|`|d0b185ecf3ac7cb0dc42db8e3fd6d9baaa	It will start feeling better in a few days. It was because you used a ball that was to heavy for you and you are not used to it.|`|dqc3SNCTaa	its just a little cramped because its not used to the weight and throwing it.<br>  <br>  next time use a lighter ball and try to be more relaxed when you throw it.|`|nOvpKNYdaa	very normal. those are achy muscles not used for a long time. give it 2 days.|`|Uu95cDj7aa	you just got a muscle cramp, quit being a drama queen.|`|axylPYftaa	dont worry, it will get stronger
uFUKFGwfaa	Dip and chew are much the same thing.  As you describe, they are different but both still can cause extreme cancer of the mouth.  It is much more than 1/10th as hazardous.

It is such a disgusting habit that is just as hazardous as the other habit but even more yucky than it is bad for you... That said, I believe that they really are just as bad, they both cause cancer and make your lip and teeth look gross. They both sit in your mouth so that you can ingest the toxic chemicals.

Unless you want your gums rotting away, I say stay the f*ck away from both.<br>  <br>  And BTW... I think I speak for most non-dip users when I say, keep your f*cking waterbottle full of chewed up dip and brown spit away from me. Or I WILL throw-up all over you.
TXCDvf49aa	Under no circumstances is it a good idea to consume less than 1000 calories a day. I'm assuming you're under the age of 20, which means you shouldn't even be considering eating less than 1500 calories a day.|`|TVnpzBGQaa	Dont be afraid to eat if you eat less junk food in your daily diet. <br>  <br>  Recent research is suggesting that physical variability is one of the most important aspects to consider in your training.

And then i like to stretch at the beginning of the day.. haha<br>  <br>  MORE TIPS: <br>  <br>  chew gum - sugar free.

The most unexpensive weight loss thing to do, is to try to burn more calories than you eat, dont eat unhealthy like a 500 calorie diet! All that will do is make you sick, you NEED to be healthy to lose weight properly. Im trying to lose weight too! So basically here are some tips to speed up your metabolism: Drink 1-3 glasses of green tea a day<br>  Try and eat Chilli peppers somehow, ((chilli DUH )) they help. <br>  8 classes of water a day<br>  <br>  the more active you are, the faster your metabolism will grow to be. <br>  <br>  did you know that breathing for an hour burns 60 calories all on its own? And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do! <br>  <br>  Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things. Bread is a bad, so try to stick to thin, HIGH in fiber, slices :) <br>  <br>  you can google all the stuff and before you know it you will feel so good about it all and IM actually excited to start working out and all that, just because I know what it will do for me!<br>  <br>  I hope i helped :D
FQiqtP33aa	Yes, if u r subjected to it for long.
E2kx5kwjaa	If you’re looking for a quicker way to burn calories, you’ve to try interval training. Interval training comprises of short, high-intensity exercise periods followed on by longer, lower-intensity periods.<br>  <br>  These 2 sets of interval training when repeated several times, to form a complete workout.<br>  <br>  Examples are:<br>  <br>  Walk-Jog sequences <br>  Run-Sprint interval
voTyeJexaa	it depends if the person is addicted. and TRUE addicts no longer have control over their useage of their addiction. continued drug abuse without addiction or dependence and just for use is volunteer behavior.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	this is a subject that im not quite sure where I stand on.... i believe in addiction, but im not so sure its a disease. i do think that there is a volunteer-like issue in continuing using, but I also think that by the time they get to this point, they are no longer who they used to be, so the things that WERE important to them (i.e. reasons to quit) arent as important anymore, therefore voiding the willingness to use willpower to stop.|`|961e1fe88a95f0b9b8011e95c339a287aa	Sometimes...When you are hooked on heroin, meth, coke/crack or any of the drugs deemed physically addictive it is longer a voluntary behavior...you are physically addicted and will be sick with out using.<br>  That is why people on these drugs steal and do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to get the dope...they need it or they can become deathly sick. Heroin detox/withdraw can kill a person.
pqVWrNFtaa	You sound like me, I hate that im like that especially with my boyfriend. I think its from my dad, he's always been like that.. <br>  but what i've been trying to do is catch myself when im getting angry and try to calm myself down and think about what im actually getting mad about... <br>  and man is hard to start actually catching yourself in the act, usually i'll think of it later on and that doesn't really help the problem... so just start to look out for when you do get mad and think about the REAL reason your actually upset,,, because it probably is not the person your taking it out on. <br>  <br>  Like today I asked my brother to help me take some stuff out of my car so we could go somewhere.. I went out to my car and started to just unload the stuff and instead of waiting for him like i could have. I just tried to carry it all, and of course my 180 dollar text book fell out of my hands and the binding broke i yelled at him when i went inside that he should have helped me.. of course i am gonna be pissed but it really wasn't his fault and i shouldn't have yelled at him for it...|`|156d702b8908052bd0660d07c6803996aa	Maybe try meditation or some yoga.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I have a short fuse and get angry really easily. I think you need to look at the people you've hurt and realize what you are doing is wrong.<br>  <br>  I think you really have some Bi-Polar or manic depressive thing. People that have Bi-Polar are sometimes sad and then happy, hyper.
312818be7ceec3a2ffd5edfa19beb2eaaa	Certain factors come into play here that we are not given.If he's 20,he'll probably not have erection problems for awhile.Adrenal glands make an amount of testosterone and possibly would see a young fellow through for now.If he's 60,he'll have a problem most likely.He'll need testosterone replacement from a patch or monthly injections.I can't say one way or the other if Viagra would work in such a case.Besides decline in libido,the man who has had testicles removed will have to watch his weight.There is a tendency to gain weight and this is due to the testosterone loss,also.It is now being stated that if a man can simply lose weight,then his testosterone levels will rise,as well.Also bone density is affected and bones break easier;calcium suppliments should be taken every day to avoid osteperosis such as women get in later years.Regards to the male you write of;I hope he is older and has had his fun.BK|`|AA11357422	Yes to castration, if the testicles are removed. But if the scrotum is removed they can rebuild a scrotum from other skin areas. <br>  Impotent is used more to mean a man that cant achieve an erection. But it also means a sterile man.<br>  But if they were to remove his testicles they will always try to get a semen sample to get some sperm so they could be frozen, for when he later decides to have children.|`|ehnxg6Utaa	yes to both questions|`|AA10953999	It will be extremely hard to conceive if his sac is removed. He may have some semen left over but once that is spent.. your chances of a child go poof. Have him store his semen before they remove them.

Then, when the bleeding stops put a little neomycin or bacitracin ointment over it and forget it.  Remember, bleeding always stops. ; )|`|5XJyxYILaa	In some male mammals the scrotum is a protuberance of skin and muscle containing the testicles. It is an extension of the abdomen, and is located between the penis and anus. In humans and some other mammals, the base of the scrotum becomes covered with pubic hair at puberty. In common speech, the scrotum is often improperly referred to as the testicles, which actually refer to organs encased inside the scrotum. The scrotum is homologous to the labia majora in females. It becomes tight when sexually aroused.|`|KBTk6V4Jaa	Must've hurt, y did you cut down there in the first place. If it was metal make sure u have tetnis shots up to date and bandage it up.

xYTagSIyaa	Seizures are serious and if indeed you both had them they were caused by something you both had exposure to.  Yes food poisoning can cause you to have a high fever and a high fever can give you seizures.  <br>  <br>  People can die from food poisoning and you should both have gone to the emergency.  Food poisoning may also need to be reported to the authorities if it is something that other people may get.  In other words if you got it from eating meat at your local store, and a women who is fighting cancer buys some of that meat she may likely die if she eats it,  and if you let the authorities know they might find a way to warn her and others like her so they don't get sick.<br>  <br>  Read the clip below if you need more information on the effects of food poisoning, but you really need to been seen by a doctor.<br>  <br>  nurse

UBgJya1eaa	I completely empathize with you so I'll share my homemade remedy....It may sound gross, but it WORKS - and you're likely at the stage where you'll try anything. <br>  <br>  Take the brine (juice) out of a jar of pickles (hopefully you have some in your fridge) and put it into a micro-microwaveable cup. Microwave for about 30-40 seconds (till steamy hot) and then hold close to your nose (careful!) breathing in as much as you can stand. Once it's cool enough, drink some and it will cure a sore throat, if you have one :-)<br>  <br>  Feel better soon!
HcoYZdy1aa	He is not allowed to tell her anything because he would be violating the HIPAA laws. Our privacy is protected by these laws<br>  <br>  He cannot give your mom any information without a power of attorney that you present to him to disclose your information to your mom. <br>  <br>  If your mom asks questions, he shouldn't answer because he knows the trouble he can get into<br>  <br>  Your mom couldn't even pick up your health records for you because of HIPAA laws.|`|m2WGmGXjaa	I'm sorry you were diagnosed with genital herpes D:<br>  <br>  But no, he shouldn't reveal this information to your mother because it's confidential. But if he does, the good news is you can sue his ***.|`|SQLSOeHcaa	I'm a nurse and I can tell you that if he does it would be unethical...There's something called :<br>  "Doctor-patient confidentiality" <br>  <br>  <a href="http://injury.findlaw.com/medical-malpractice/breaches-of-doctor-patient-confidentiality.html" rel="nofollow">http://injury.findlaw.com/medical-malpra...</a>|`|mnFTWfCZaa	May is right, there are HIPAA laws that are VERY strict about confidentiality. Your doctor won't say anything and if for some reason he is retarded and does say something, you could sue him for A LOT of money. But I don't think you have to worry about it, most doctors are pretty professional especially when it's such a sensitive issue. <br>  <br>  And when it comes to insurance, they dont put specifically what tests are done. it's very vague. I asked my nurse practitioner about that before because I was nervous just like you about the whole billing thing.<br>  <br>  From a nursing prospective, I hate HIPAA, but from a patient's perspective, it's WONDERFUL.|`|bAicPpJaaa	no, you're 18 so he can't because it's confidential information. if he does tell your mom, then you can sue him for malpractice.|`|ilMi2HSeaa	legally he can't disclose anything...not even to confirm that you are in fact his patient. but, if you're still feeling wary or uncomfortable, bring it up with him at your next appointment.|`|ZhRlt325aa	No, it is against the law. Doctor-patient confidentiality.|`|iM1j8I9Haa	Technically no,  your doctor doctor should not discuss anything with your mother.  <br>  However, if you are on your mothers insurance & she pays the premiums she actually has the right to see what she pays for.  Most people don't know this..and doctors usually don't tell patients this either.  I think you should specifically tell your doctor that you are not comfortable with him sharing you information with your mother if she asks him.  <br>  <br>  If all else doesn't work, switch doctors.|`|Oy5nMZ0xaa	usually doctors will tell mothers but seeing as u are an adult and 18, he should respect that and make sure to keep everything private, if not u can sue because its illeagal to discuss patients to some one other than the patient them selves its supposed to be confidential but if he knows that ur mom is ur mom... he might tell. thats a tough one. i sugest u call your doctor and make sure he doesnt tell anyone. im so sorry! this must really suck.:( i hope it works out with your mom|`|YKtVjnGCaa	No, he isn't allowed to. If he does tell her, it would be a good idea to sue him because he is not allowed to give out confidential information even if she is your mum. You are 18 anyway so in reality she doesn't even have a right to ask.|`|K5BLCZPkaa	No, its illegal since you're 18. Ohh, and you just told a lot of people about your herpes. But, I am sorry that you have it.|`|2trvwpqiaa	No, It's confidential information.|`|9Q5xIAlhaa	i'm pretty sure he can't, because it's usually kept as confidential information.<br>  <br>  and i'm sorry bout that. :/
2nz0oB35aa	125-130 is perfect. You should make sure to pay a lot of attention to your lower body, such as crunches and lunges, but make sure to also balance your exercise or your body could create an unbalance and cause you to have an abnormal figure. also, be sure not to diet, but rather, eat healthy. Diets never seem to work because once you lose the weight, when you start eating normally again, you gain back all of the weight you lost and more. Also, be sure to drink a lot of water since that is about 5 pounds right there.|`|Du8QhOmaaa	I think even 125 is a good goal. I would do lunges to work out your lower body. they are an excellent thing to do to burn fat in the legs. The best thing about them is that there is no equipment to buy :)
Har7in1Oaa	You should be O.K. as long as you keep it clean.  The clear stuff is just antibodies as you already know.  If your finger gets really sore or starts to ooze you should go to the doctor.  And your not a moron.  It never hurts to be cautious.|`|AA11615638	It doesn't sound infected.  If it were infected it would be draining a yellow/greenish puss and it would smell.  Also it would be swollen and very painful.  <br>  But it can easily become infected.  To help keep that from happening, wash your hands frequently and put an ointment like Neosporin on it.  Also, if you can keep it covered with a bandage or even a cotton ball taped on, especially when doing art projects or anything else that requires a little protection, that would help alot.|`|3u3zSqZWaa	Pour some hydrogen peroxide on it.  It's a first aid antiseptic for minor cuts.  It foams up if cut is infected.  But not to worry, that's comman.  If cut doesn't get better or starts having red streaks from the cut going up the arm then you should see a doctor.  But it sounds ok.  Keep it clean and pour peroxide on it 2 or 3 times a day to keep infection out.  And this may sound crazy but I promise it works and it won't hurt you.  After you pour peroxide on it let it air dry then squeeze a small amount of super glue over the cut.   It works better than a band-aid and it won't hurt you.
nmxS4vRDaa	You could try putting ice on your nose... It will probably be feeling better by tomorrow. And if it's unbearably painful, take pain pills. If your nose feels loose or doesn't stop hurting, go see a doctor!<br>  Other than that, just wait it out.<br>  Hope it stops hurting! :/|`|1cMugdkLaa	The last time I know of that I or ANYONE else hit their head against a cement wall and had headaches that went away, it turned out to be a concussion.

Better safe than sorry.|`|HQ6Ax4CUaa	I wouldn't really worry about it.  I have hit my head before like that and been fine.  If you are feeling dizzy or having unexplained head aches, do have it checked out.  The only problems that usually develop from getting hit with a soccer ball are usually dying teeth when you get hit in the mouth.|`|Jz8S4wrfaa	Well, get a good nights rest first, and if it it still hurting tomorrow you may want to go see a physician.

Have you tried putting an ice pack on it?
arDVgzgqaa	It depends on the person, of course. I personally go just as often as before I had diabetes. 3-4 hours usually.<br>  <br>  Though slightly more often with high blood sugar, I suppose.|`|AA10358331	How often is normal? There isn't really a norm for how often. Because peeing is determined by what you ate, how high or low your blood sugar is. <br>  For me.. its usually every hour or two.
HcoYZdy1aa	Max dose on Ibuprofen is 3200mg for an adult. <br>  Ibuprofen cannot cause stomach or body to go numb but it definitely can cause stomach upset especially if it was taken on an empty stomach. <br>  <br>  Liver damage can be done if an excessive amount of Ibuprofen is taken, but it will not cause any damage if a 14 year old just took it one time.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	No it will not cause numbness. Why, I don't know. Something to do with its mechanism of action. It doesn't remove sensation completely.<br>  <br>  One big dose like this is not going to injure the liver of a healthy 14 year old. It could easily damage his stomach lining though, causing a bleeding ulcer.
CvFajKPUaa	I would not take it for at least 24 hours before consuming alcohol.  I would also wait till dinner time the next day before taking it again.
HcoYZdy1aa	Mucinex is an expectorant and Claritin is just an antihistamine. You need to take a decongestant. You can pick Sudafed 12 hour (twice a day) or I am a big fan of Zyrtec-D, which is an an antihistamine plus a decongestant. The decongestant will take a couple days to work in full effect. The fastest relief you can do is Vicks 12 hour nasal spray where you inhale 1 to 2 sprays in each nostril. This will work the fastest but it is a product not recommended for more than three days of use. <br>  <br>  Therefore, I would go get some Sudafed and Vicks 12 hours spray. The off brands such as Wal-mart's brand, walgreen's brand is ok because it will probably cheaper. Sudafed might be sold behind the pharmacy counter, where you have to show your driver's license for it. It depends on what state you are in. Just don't get the Sudafed PE because it is a re-formulated product ever since strict regulation on Sudafed came out in certain states. Sudafed PE does not work as well as the original Sudafed.|`|FwZyFTA0aa	You don't have to do all of these, but if one doesn't work try another...<br>  <br>  1. Take a hot shower- Hot showers release tension and also are a great way to unclog noses. It's what I always did (I don't get nose clogs anymore though because I've had post-nasal drip for like a year)<br>  <br>  2. Hot Tea- Since you drink through your mouth the steam from the tea should go into your nose and hopefully unclog it.<br>  <br>  3. Humidifier- Put your face in-front of a humidifier with a washcloth over your face for about 5 minutes. It opens your pours and unclogs noses =)<br>  <br>  4. Eat something spicy- It might not be the first resort, but it works =) Just keep plenty of water nearby afterwards.<br>  <br>  5. Turn up the heat- If you don't want to take the time to do any of these I would suggest to just turn up the heat. It takes a little longer and raises the bill a little though, so I wouldn't see this as a very good option.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better =)|`|TwxdagGTaa	Sudafed tends to work pretty well. Or maybe something stronger...I know you've said you've tried Claritin but have you tried Claritin MD? It's a lot stronger and has helped with my allergies in the past. <br>  <br>  If those things don't work, try drinking camomile tea. It sounds kind of cheesy but when i was little I used to get bad allergies and the doctor told me to drink it before going to bed. It really did work. Another more homeopathic option that's very good is Olbas oil. You can get it from Whole Foods or any health food store. It comes in nasal sprays or cough drops or even bubble bath. It's amazing at clearing out your sinuses.|`|qaPwDVNWaa	you can buy nose sprays from chemists|`|8sB8ASncaa	Try eating something super spicy.|`|WEzv0n0Baa	Cup your hands and fill them with water and sniff the water up your nose,and no you will not drown, that will clear you right up. You can add salt to the water but expect a burning sensation for a brief moment. It works well and is very inexpensive.I would suggest to you to investigate Reflexology.

AA11429880	It could either be jock itch, which you treat with any anti-fungal cream, or it could be heat rash or an allergy to soap, laundry soap, etc., which you can treat with over the counter hydrocortisone cream.  Try that first, if it's heat rash or an allergic rash, it should clear up in a day or 2, if it doesn't, try the antifungal cream.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	Your peep is on the fritz! <br>  <br>  Could be an allergic reaction to a body product.  Could be shaving irritation.  Could be something from a public bathroom?|`|Ki5xSgmGaa	It's likely jock itch which is a fungal infection and very common in young men. Try some anti-fungal cream or powder.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	It could maybe be new hair growth, I used to get lumps where new hair was starting to grow, when I was in puberty.<br>  <br>  It could also be an allergy or a skin problem. Try to see if the spots look like they are all hair follicles. If not, or you can't tell, you can ask a doctor about this, don't be shy. It's not a sexual problem of any sort, it's a skin problem.
X1TeqHcxaa	Try the Internet.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I've had them occasionally for months on each side of my neck for tendinitis, they start to work immediately and work for weeks to give relief.|`|sfBKFSEfaa	I've had several in my left knee and one in my back.  They were fairly helpful, but sometimes the condition gets slightly more painful from the needle until the medicine kicks in.  The doctor even told me this.  So I'd say they are fairly helpful, but certainly not a cure-all.
9pLdhuBnaa	I have never fractured the 5th metatarsal bone, but have had surgery on my foot before and I had to wear my walking boot throughout the house and outside for about 4 weeks, and then after that just for going outside, and then later I got permission to start trying to transition back in to a shoe.<br>  <br>  Walking on the foot too soon could make the problem worse and make it harder for that area to heal, but I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

cXXJVz64aa	It depends on the age. As a child, other kids would harass you terribly. That would make you depressed, you would eat more, and the cycle would continue unless someone helps you break it. You would not be happy. As an adult, it's hard to find clothes that fit, people tend to ignore you, and it predisposes you to Diabetes, high blood pressure, and other chronic disorders.|`|EnyhoOmTaa	I am obese (I am losing weight, though).<br>  There are little things that you probably don't even concern yourself with that I think about. Like in a classroom, if the seats are too close together you find an alternate route so you don't move the desk or embarrass yourself. Going up to a friend's apartment on the fourth floor of a building, you have to stop and catch your breathe so you don't look like an idiot, but you don't want people to know that you need to catch your breathe, so you pretend to read a sign or poster...things like that.<br>  <br>  My father has diabetes and he is also overweight.

Next time you workout build the intensity don't try to overdo just starting out it doesn't work out so well as you can see.

J97oYgvyaa	My mom died three years ago of cancer it was a tough hard road to begin with and being just four months after her death you Still need time to just get out of the denial Stage of her dying. i know it feels hard and like you can't do it at times but the fact is you'll get through it. Time has a way of healing our hard times be patient with yourselves allow yourself to grieve and notice the good times you had with her and if you have any spiritual background know that she's in a better place and not suffering an terrible pain anymore.|`|l0hq7sjdaa	I think the shock / attention / busy-ness of dealing with death at the beginning can put all of the emotions to the side for a while.  Then a few months later the loneliness of being without that person can really hit and it feels worse because there isn't the support that there was at first.  <br>  For me, reaching out to friends and people who have been in similar circumstances helps.  I lost a very close friend over two years ago and I still dream of her often.  My grandmother, who I was close to as well, died about 4 years ago.  And both deaths can hit me at a moment's notice.  <br>  I think writing down memories and letters to the person can help as well.  It helps feel the connection again.  Find a friend that will let you talk about little things that you remember.  That always helps me somehow.<br>  <br>  The main thing is knowing that even ten years from now, it's okay to just really miss her.  <br>  There will never really be a moment where you feel over it I don't think, but there will be a time when you realize you've gone a few days without feeling really sad.<br>  I'm sorry for your loss and good luck to you.|`|AA10953999	My Mom has been gone 19 months or so now. I cried daily for months. It takes a while to get through the grief. I handle it better now but there are days when I cannot believe she is gone. <br>  <br>  Sometimes when the realization hits me grief is hard to control. You'll get through it, like everyone else has said it is not easy and it doesn't happen over night but with time you will be able to handle her passing.<br>  <br>  At four months you are still probably wondering why and are in disbelief. I know I was, I would see people walking with their moms and feel an overwhelming sense of sadness. Every holiday,birth, celebration is not the same yet we somehow get through it. Take it easy.|`|w4HkJujcaa	I still cry a lot, but memories of her will pop in my head, and you will be surprised of the things you think of.  Cherish and focus on those memories.  I have tried to focus on the time when I will see her again in heaven.  That helps a lot.  I think about how everything here cannot be just a fluke or an accident.  I still grieve, but the hurt is not as bad or as often after a few years, but pay attention to touches you will feel and if you ever have a problem maybe you will get to see her as I did.  Pray a lot.

6YnwXCIaaa	It's always about risks versus benefits.  Pregnancy generally isn't the time to have an elective surgical procedure.  However, you're talking about emergency situations.  The risk of surgery on a pregnant woman/fetus overall is lower than the risk of leaving in a ruptured appendix and developing a septic abdomen and septic shock.  Anesthetists are trained in giving anesthesia to pregnant women.  There are some different techniques that sometimes have to be used, and their physiology is different, but it's not like it's completely foreign or contraindicated.|`|vRByrkMjaa	?Well the surgeon experts knows already what is to be done and what is not to be done~_^|`|cXXJVz64aa	It depends on how far along you are with your pregnancy. If your appendix burst, they would still do surgery and hope for the best. If you are far along and can wait until after birth, they would. It all depends on how far along you are. They can use low dose x-rays now.|`|XTN6ZH2Paa	I don't know much about this, but I suppose they would stabilize you, then check to see the health of the baby. They might need to do premature Cesarean birth, if the baby is that far along. If the baby is fine, they will proceed normally.

Clothes fit better, look better, you don't get as tired as you used to, and you find you can do things now that would exhaust you before your weight loss.<br>  <br>  People shouldn't but they really do treat you better.<br>  A sad commentary of our society but there you got it, the way things should be and the way things are.|`|kdu2pzWiaa	So far I have lost 10pounds, and still working on it.  To you answer your question I fell a allot happier now.|`|26ee4e29fb7ebc573ffeb89f23421e19aa	It feels fantastic!<br>  You really only realize how annoying and tiring it is to be overweight after you've lost the weight.You feel literally lighter! You'll have much more energy because you don't need to lug around all that weight anymore, and you don't have to worry about muffin tops showing and things like that all the time.<br>  Now I can't believe I ever weighed as much as I did, I can hardly believe that I ever was that big.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I did some reading about it as a result of your question and find that over aggressive D&C causes most cases of this problem.  You certainly fit the description in the research.  It seems to be hard to diagnose and can't be detected through ultrasound scan.  I would probably see a new doctor for a proper diagnosis of my symptoms before contacting the doctor that did the D&C originally.  You would have to consult a lawyer regarding liability.  However, the original retained placenta might not have been the fault of your doctors and therefore might exempt them from liability.  It could be worth checking into though.  <br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|YbVFL3SOaa	Asherman's syndrome is due to uterine endometrial scarring after D &C.  It consists of intrauterine scars, fibrosis, adhesions.  It occurs in up to 40% of women who have had D&C for retained products of conception.  It can cause infertility, difficult pregnancies, abnormal menses and sometimes pain.  So to answer your question could you have Asherman's syndrome....yes.  Is it causing mood swings probably not.  Is it causing the lack of periods..possibly due to blockage.  Are the doctors liable?..Anytime the uterus is curettaged there is a chance of adhesions and the curetting was necessary to remoe the retained products.
9Q5xIAlhaa	while i can completely not answer the rest, i have a comment:<br>  <br>  OUUUUCH. D;<br>  that's gotta hurt.<br>  <br>  anyway, did you try everything to make shaving comfortable?<br>  this is what i do. and i turn out fine now (i didn't before this)<br>  1. take a nice warm (for me hot!) bath for a while, put bubbles, a rubber ducky, whatever floats your boat.<br>  2. put a LOT of shaving cream (i use my dad's Barbasol) around where you're saving, and let it sit for a while so it can soak in.<br>  3. shave, and make sure to not run over the same spot more than 3 times, to avoid irritation.<br>  ^^ do that for legs & possibly pits, too. (:|`|ilMi2HSeaa	eep, don't do it yourself! it is kinda awkward the first time, after all you don't generally let strangers down in that area, but it is so worth it to get it done professionally. it hurts, so you want the person to know what they are doing, and if it's not done properly (ie. the hair breaks instead of getting pulled out) the smooth results don't last long, and ingrowns can be an issue. ask around, see if your friends have a waxer they love, and make an appointment. it's really not so embarrassing after the first strip...you'll be too distracted.|`|N4ijiX2Caa	when you shave your pubic hair, dont shave upward! that's what gives you rash and burn!<br>  i dont like at home waxing, it hurts like a mother ****** and if you wanna go get it done, do it with confidence!
h3NJO9dWaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your son. My sister was addicted to meth for years and put my mom in a position like you are now. My mom didn't want to kick her out for the same reason and it really took a toll on her. Finally she got caught with it and the cops cut her a deal where she would go to rehab for a year instead of prison. <br>  Best thing to happen to her. Heroin is impossible to get off of alone, and 30 days is not near long enough. Talk to him about rehab again and pick a rehab facility that is far away so it's not as easy to come home too. <br>  My sister went to Gatehouse in AZ and they have a really strong program .The first 30-60 days people are there they are out on a ranch in the desert and they can't escape or use the phone. It may sound cruel but it's the only way to go through withdrawal and get them to not leave. Once the worst of withdrawal is over he should follow the twelve step program with you guys. Please somehow find a way to get him to rehab. My sis went through 4 before this one, but she did it. You just can't give up on him and let him know how much you love him. I would also reccomend for you to go to some meetings to help you deal with your issues that your son has created through his drug use. They have meetings all over for family members of alcoholics and drug addicts, and I would suggest them if you haven't been.|`|ZYG8uWByaa	send him to rehab, even of he doesn't want to go say its rehab or jail and if that doesn't clean him up send him to jail. i know its tough my cousin was on heroin and he always went to rehab and he just never cleaned up he would steal from us and his father would just pay the damages so no one pressed charges finally he was fed up and sent him to jail..he learned is leason and has been clean for 3 years now.|`|275a76c3021b903d93c9b6d665b05088aa	I feel tough love is the best way. It tears your heart out I know, but if you stand back and do nothing you are just enabling them to ruin their lives more. He needs to go to a clinic, have you tried a intervention with someone who is trained to do that?  My husband finally had to boot his son out and quit taking care of him, he was stealing money from us, equipment from the farm just for money to buy more meth. He is now clean and making his own way in the world. It took a while to get to that point, but it had to be done.|`|HcoYZdy1aa	Unfortunately, there is no definite answer to this. <br>  <br>  The person has to have a "strong will" to quit. Of course right now, he's not in his right mind because of the drugs<br>  <br>  What I would do is, try my best to convince him to go to rehab, and let him detox for at least 1 month. Then he needs to go into sober living, where there are strict living standards, and maintain his sobriety. Throughout this time, he has to have strong will to quit and stay sober. He's an adult so he can leave anytime he wants to. The hardest part will be convincing him to go through with everything (rehab and sober living).|`|rLzvq0aPaa	I will pray for you and your family. It sounds as if you are at the intervention point. Ever watch Intervention on (I think it's) A&E. Jail or prison is not what your son needs he needs to admit there is a problem and go willingly to rehab because after jail he may be clean but usually they dont stay clean and have many other issues. get your family together tell him how much your lives have been affected by this. He is so young! and tell him that he will lose your support if he doesnt go to rehab and mean it. It will be hard but...there is help <br>  <br>  Behavioral therapies<br>  Although behavioral and pharmacologic treatments can be extremely useful when employed alone, science has taught us that integrating both types of treatments will ultimately be the most effective approach. There are many effective behavioral treatments available for heroin addiction. These can include residential and outpatient approaches. An important task is to match the best treatment approach to meet the particular needs of the patient. Moreover, several new behavioral therapies, such as contingency management therapy and cognitive-behavioral interventions, show particular promise as treatments for heroin addiction. Contingency management therapy uses a voucher-based system, where patients earn òpointsó based on negative drug tests, which they can exchange for items that encourage healthy living. Cognitive-behavioral interventions are designed to help modify the patient's thinking, expectancies, and behaviors and to increase skills in coping with various life stressors. Both behavioral and pharmacological treatments help to restore a degree of normalcy to brain function and behavior, with increased employment rates and lower risk of HIV and other diseases and criminal behavior.<br>  <br>  read this sight show it to your family and son if he will listen and look for help outside the family.. addiction is psychological and physical and there may  be a mental health clinic in your area with sugestions to help.

A8CsiYl1aa	No, it's not "sad".<br>  You don't want to be smoking just to be cool or giving lectures on how bad smoking is. It's an enlightening experience every time so just enjoy it. Once I'm high I just like to do the things I love most. I completely understand smoking alone, I myself have severed ties with many friends honestly because I hate  that whole "stoner" or "pothead" clique. Just have fun with it and make sure your grades or other responsibilities aren't disregarded.|`|0xBvybIxaa	i tried it once..liked it...and thought about don't it alone too, but wasn't too sure...i didn't want anyone to know i did  and my boyfriend is on probation so if he gets caught with weed he will get in big big trouble, so i don't want to temp him. and i am kinda new where i live so don't have anyone to do it with...<br>  <br>  and don't listen to people on here saying weed is bad...blah blah blah...weeds not a drug!!!<br>  <br>  anyways, i don't think it's weird.|`|7eUTITNjaa	No dude!

4TcgAVgEaa	A dermitologist can help reduce acne and scarring.<br>  <br>  I hate to tell you though, some people are born models, others are not. It is all in the gene pool|`|AA11693263	The acne in your pubic hair might not be acne at all. It could possibly be a condition called folicolitus (SP) or even mulluscum. (SP) For the other areas that you have acne there are prescription acne medications that your doctor can prescribe to you. You can also get a script for an antibiotic to help clear it up since acne is caused from dirt and bacteria in the pores. I had a terrible acne problem when I was in my late twenties. It covered the entire left half of my face. It was horrible. My doctor gave me a script for an antibiotic and it was completely cleared up in about a month. I can't remember off the top of my head the name of the antibiotic but it begins with a "D".

Har7in1Oaa	I know where you are coming from.  I broke my femur when I was 9.  It can get awfully boring. I was in traction for 4 weeks and a body cast for 6 months.  Talk about a bummer.   You have to remember that rest is the best medicine.  A broken bone is a serious injury especially in your leg. You should be O.K. to go to the mall or movie or whatever you want as long as your are careful.  I have had more than a few broken bones so I kind of speak from experience when I tell you that your body will let you know what you can and can't do;)   You sound like a person that isn't happy just sitting around and that's awesome....Just take some time to heal up.  Then you will be back at it again.|`|XpXV1xNgaa	inactivity is bad and leads to muscle atrophy which makes joints more prone to injury.  also, bones exposed to stress (e.g. weightlifting) increase in density and those that aren't stressed start to weaken.  sitting around can also lead to blood clots in your legs/lungs (e.g. "economy class syndrome").  and if your leg is in a cast and you walk on crutches, the bone is probably not going to be affected by anything anyway.|`|AsZH2ZZ1aa	only leave your place once every other day....<br>  its not really gonna slow down the healing to much if it all....<br>  but! if you do something everyday its gonna put ALOT of strain on ur leg and slow down ur healing process.<br>  <br>  i hope you get better soon =)<br>  <br>  p.s i know that feeling of boredom.<br>  i broke both my legs in a dirtbike accident. it sucked!!!<br>  just give it time. trust me.|`|1ce0b31352ddac4983f71b8fd4ae3b56aa	Actually, it was discovered in the 50s that ambulation (walking around) speeds recovery from injuries.<br>  <br>  Doctors at MASH (Mobile Army Surgicul Hospitals) noticed their patients recovered faster than patients evacuated to permanent facilities.  The MASH units by necessity got their patients moving as fast as possible.  Later studies support this.  I'm surprised your doctor didn't recommend getting some  excercise.
H7UphlLCaa	there is this stuff online called maxim. it's like super antiperspirant, you can put it on any part of your body and it makes it not sweat. oh and it REALLY works. you use it overnight, and it takes a couple days to start working, and can itch at first.  but after you start using it, it's like a once a week thing, and i only use it like once a month now.  and it still works, because it's awesome.  it's only like 20 dollars a bottle, and that was with shipping and handeling.
16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	It sounds like  a minor thing.<br>  Try stretching it.<br>  <br>  Go to a wall (not the floor, this isn't a push up).  place your hands shoulder with apart like you were going to do a push up.   Then rotate the wrists outward.  Try to go till your fingers face 6 o'clock, but don't force it if you can only go to 9' o'clock, fine.<br>  Then lean on your hands.  Don't bounce.

I don't have any scarring from Dermatend, all I did was use a healing ointment I had at home when my moles fell off.<br>  <br>  I imagine since that your mole is gone from the root to the surface, the chance of a melanoma developing would not exist. <br>  <br>  If your thinking about removing a mole, I would recommend giving Dermatend a try. It contains only natural ingredients and comes with a 100% guarantee.<br>  <br>  I bought Deramtend from www.mole-wartremoval.com which is a web store powered by amazon.com, buying from a well known website, made my confidence in the transaction increase.|`|AA12066269	If it worked people wouldn't have to go the the doctor to have them removed.

I don't know exact figures for dollar amount but one tip is to find out what  pain meds you will be on & get you Doctor to prescribe them for you (ahead of time) & take them in with you, as most hospital charge a crazy amount for pills like $15.00 (or more, some much much more!) for a single Tylenol. Most hospital will take your meds & dispense them to you as needed & you would probably only pay 1/3 of that same $15.00 for the complete stay instead of 4 times per day time the whole time you are in hospital.

Exercise to keep in shape, but exercise will not get rid of the fat, it will only hide it with strong muscles. Building muscle burns more calories. So exercise moderately and change your eating habits. Portion control is key.|`|0WR6oPxhaa	Targetted weight loss is quite difficult, some peeple would declare impossible, however the sole method that really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it was reported in Fox News and USA Today.

27af90e0f6dfc8baff90052bd5ee1e76aa	it might take a little more than 3 weeks, but u really should not over do it. and keep eating 3 meals a day. believe me people gain more fat from missing meals. if i were you, i'd work out 2x a day for 1 hr, 4 or 5 days a week. ur body needs rest. and switch it around, if you run in the morning, do some weight lifting in the eveining and so on. do some abs such as sit ups, crunches, supine bicycles, obliques etc.. these will work your stomach. and keep eating healthy, and i also mean 3 meals a day. last but not least, no matter what kind of body, as long as you're comfortable in it and you are happy, and you should be. good luck!!!!|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Believe me hun im right there with you.

Just try to stick with it|`|XQJg3RNTaa	no, after three weeks like that you should be seeing some results, I'm worried about your definition of cardio because I certainly couldn't do any of my cardio routines for more than thirty minutes unless I'm just on a long distance run which I rarely do. <br>  1) while your burning fat your building muscle at the same time, muscle has higher density than fat so your weight may be staying constant because your losing fat at the same rate your building muscle, does your body look different or the same?<br>  2) It takes much longer than most people think to lose weight, it's a very painful and long process, so don't get discouraged now. <br>  <br>  I'm worried about the intensity of your cardio, what do you do for cardio? If you don't feel like your about to die when your done you've wasted the effort, are you sweating and guzzling water at the end of your cardio, or do you just stop and go do something else? Don't use ellipticals if possible, there's no substitute for some good ol' fashioned running. <br>  <br>  Studies have shown that more people achieve their weight loss goals (still only 40%) using HIT training than any other method.<br>  Instead of spending at least 9hrs a week on cardio how does about 1hr a week sound with twice or three times the result? HIT literature is easy to obtain with google, it's basically just running with mixed speeds for 20 minutes, instead of constantly for 1.5 hrs. <br>  <br>  If you want your goals you have to earn them, you can't walk off 20lbs.

You seem to be what it called high functioning, meaning that not only do you have insight into yourself and others, but that you have a better chance of living a good life once you get away from that messed up home. If your dad uses physical force, you can call the police or talk to the school guidance counselor. You could call a teen suicide hotline and get ideas from them. You could call your state's social services department and ask them for advice. You could also investigate being emancipated from your parents so that you could legally leave home at the age of 16. I know someone who grew up in the same kind of household you're describing. He left at the age of 17 to go to college, and never returned until after his dad died. He's been happily married for almost 27 years. So, whatever you do, remember there's light at the end of the tunnel. But, I hope you investigate your options. If I was you, I'd begin writing down your evidence of physical and emotional abuse, and then call a teen hotline and try to find a lawyer to emancipate you. Then, perhaps you could move in with your sister. It will be tough at first, but you're a survivor, and once you're out of that crazy household things will gradually get better and better.|`|M8f4BorPaa	maybe you should talk to someone you feel comfortable around and idk if u wanna move out of ur house cuz like do u still love them? or not but if u talk to ppl like at those abused centers they find homes and stuff for abused children and that sounds like ur case.<br>  <br>  -hope this helps...|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	Yes, it appears like the italian movie 'padre padrone'<br>  and maybe your mom also is dominating and has same disposition, mom and dad r birds of the same feature, this will compound all your problems,<br>  but time will change everything, u need a lot of time and patience.<br>  Meanwhile, take advise from the bible, u need to be simple as a dove but subtle as the serpant.

Simple things like walking your dog(if you have one) or walking to someones house instead of getting your parents to drive you is exercise and will make you look healthier and look better.

From the Sumerians who invented beer in 6000 B.C.E. to the Merck Company who patented ecstasy in the early 20th century, people have been finding new ways to get high throughout history.  It has only been in the past century however, that chemical advances have lead to highly addictive forms of drugs; drugs such as heroin, methamphetamines, and cocaine. Drugs have become like shopping for cars, there’s a color, shape, size and price range for everyone.  As a former and frequent drug user, I will take you into the history and danger of the drugs marijuana and Oxycontin.<br>   Marijuana or Cannabis sativa can be dated back to the ancient Chinese in 6000 B.C.  Originally, its seeds were used as a food spice and as a good source of fiber, but quickly developed medicinal and recreational purposes.  Marijuana was first recorded as a form of medicine in 2727 B.C. by the Chinese; its euphoric side effects were thought to have healing properties to treat all different forms of illnesses.  It rapidly spread to India in 1200 B.C.E. where it was used as a ceremonial and religious offering to the Goddess Shiva.  By 500 B.C., it spread into primitive nomadic tribes where it was constantly used as an intoxicant or source of inebriation.  Since then, marijuana has spread throughout every continent and nearly every culture, along with controversy surrounding its use.  Marijuana was banned in America in 1937 and labeled as a schedule I drug (which I will discuss later).  In recent years however, many have tried to argue that marijuana does have medicinal purposes because of its innate ability to relieve stress and pain.  It is estimated that there are 14 million Americans who use marijuana on a frequent basis.  There is a vast amount of skepticism, however, whether or not the benefits of smoking marijuana outweigh the costs.<br>   Marijuana contains a compound known as tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which reacts with receptors in the brain causing normal functions to waver.  Once the THC hits the bloodstream, “it passes itself off as a neurotransmitter - the chemicals which carry messages between neurons in the brain. THC is shaped much like a neurotransmitter called anandamide, which means it can sneak itself into the brain’s anandamide receptor proteins and start to cause mischief.”(null-hypothosis.com) When smoked, THC hits the bloodstream at such a rapid rate that the effects are felt within seconds.  The THC in marijuana creates feelings of euphoria which are due to its reaction with dopamine; “the chemical that is well known for generating feelings of pleasure and motivation.” (Null-hypothosis.com) It is not yet clearly defined by scientists why THC reacts with dopamine, but there are some theories.  Many scientists believe that when THC reacts with receptor proteins, a signal is sent directly to the dopamine transmitter; releasing an exorbitant amount of the hormone, but it is still widely debated.  Another theory not yet proven is that the body naturally produces some THC and more is simply released when excessive amounts of the endorphin enter the body.   It is true that marijuana can temporarily hide the symptoms of diseases such as parkinson’s and depression, but it is believed that the consequences much outweigh the benefits.<br>   It is well known that smoking cigarettes leads to a high risk of heart disease, oral and lung cancer, the same goes for marijuana.  Although it may not have the chemicals that a cigarette has such as tar, nicotine and ammonia, it is still unnatural for any type of smoke to enter your lungs or mouth.  Marijuana has also been recently linked to an increased chance of developing schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.  Another effect of marijuana is a significantly increased appetite, which can be a good or bad thing.  For people with disorders and diseases such as anorexia and HIV, it works as a great stimulant for developing healthy eating habits.  However, it also doubles as means of developing poor eating habits that lead to obesity.  Marijuana is also referred to as a gateway drug, which means that chances are likely a user will move onto more extreme drugs such as heroin, crack, and methamphetamines; this theory is still being debated in the scientific world.  However, it has formerly been my experience being surrounded by so many marijuana users, that I have yet to see any of them cling to just marijuana.  I do not believe user’s bodies develop an addiction to the drug, merely an anxiety of separation.  The euphoric feelings are so pleasant while on the drug, that being off of it begins to feel inadequate, causing the user to develop dependency.  Marijuana is not only smoked nowadays, it is used as tea, butter spread, cooking batter, and even candy.  But however it is used, marijuana will always strike controversy in all parts of the world.  <br>   Since Marijuana’s ban in America in 1937, there have been multiple movements to remove the ban, the greatest one being the hippy movement of the seventies.  People embraced a new kind of mentality in this time period; there was an increased want for love, and objection to war.  It was believed by the radicals known as hippies that if you replaced violence and war with love, you could create the perfect utopia.  It was the motto of that movement to do whatever felt good, including drugs.  Marijuana was the most widely used drug during this time period because of its ability to produce feelings of euphoria.  As a result, people were working less, and getting high more.  The government eventually cracked down on drug use, and destroyed the hippy movement.  However, since then, the number of marijuana users has increased dramatically.  Because of America’s vast amount of marijuana users, law enforcement has turned its shoulder towards the issue and has become a little more lenient in enforcing the ban.   However, there are still drugs that have not become as widely accepted as marijuana. <br>   The advancements in modern medicine have increased tremendously over the past century, along with its abuse.  The most commonly abused prescription drugs are pain relievers, mainly those of the oxycodone family.  “Oxycodone also is sold under the trade names Percocet, Percodan,” Tylox and OxyContin.  (usdoj.gov)   Some users report abuse as early as twelve years old, but is most commonly used among high school students and highly paid adults.  The oxycodone family has been labeled a schedule two drug.  Schedule two drugs are any drugs containing “Opium and opiate, and any salt, compound, derivative, or preparation of opium or opiate excluding apomorphine, thebaine-derived butorphanol, dextrorphan, nalbuphine, nalmefene, naloxone, and naltrexone, and their respective salts.” (cnsm.csulb.edu)  They are also “drugs with a high abuse risk, but also have safe and accepted medical uses in the United States.” (tsbp.state.tx.us)  Since oxycodone’s approval in 1995 by the food and drug administration, pharmaceutical companies have been consistently developing higher potencies of the drug. <br>   Oxycodone, but more specifically Oxycodone Hydrochloride, contains a chemical called opium derived from the opium poppy.  Opium abuse dates as far back as the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who would take the milky liquid from the seeds of the opium poppy, leave it to dry, and crush it into a fine powder where upon they would digest it for pain relief.   Modern medicine has clearly advanced since then and has found ways to concentrate the drug for maximum effectiveness.  “Oxycodone is an agonist opioid” (howstuffworks.com) which means you feel better if you take more.  Oxycodone works by reacting with the opiod receptors located in the central nervous system.   “Oxycodone mimic’s the action of natural endorphins by combining with the opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord. This blocks the transmission of pain signals sent by the nerves to the brain. Therefore, even though the cause of the pain may remain, less pain is actually felt.” (tiscali.co.uk)  There are ways, however, to intensify the high.  <br>  Oxycodone comes in the form of time released pills that can work up to twelve hours, but some view this as a nuisance.  Many people would rather feel the high instantly and more intensely, so instead of swallowing the pill, the time released outer coating is washed off, crushed and snorted, or deluded in water and shot up.  Both of the methods increase the high by getting the drug directly into the blood stream and skipping the time released phase all together.  Because oxycodone contains a form of heroin in it, it is very addictive when abused.  It is very dangerous however to ingest oxycodone other than its intended way.  Abusers who snort or shoot the drug grow increasingly tolerant of the drug and will eventually need stronger doses of the drug.  This extremely increases the chances of an overdose which is fairly common.  Overdoses happen by consuming more of a drug than your body can handle or combining it with other drugs or chemicals that react and cause organ failure.  It is very common for someone to overdose on oxycodone because of its highly concentrated chemicals.  When oxycodone and alcohol are mixed, the combination is nearly 100 percent fatal.  There are, however, other consequences that come with abuse to this drug.  As a former oxycodone addict, I frequently crushed and snorted many different kinds of pain killers.  As a result of my foolish behavior, I have a semi perforated septum and can hardly breathe through my nose.  I will need surgery if not multiple ones in order correct what I destroyed.  Every day I wish I could go back and have a second chance, but sometimes you just need to live wi

FMajZYS2aa	Depend on the situation. If you needed extraction of teeth prior to braces, your lip support might be less because your front teeth will be moving back more. <br>  If you didn't have extraction, your face won't change much. However, we also have to consider growth of face. <br>  <br>  The other thing that would change your face totally is orthognathic surgery. Which is to move your jaw bone to help aligh your teeth. <br>  <br>  If you don't wear your retainer, then your teeth may become crooked again.|`|L5ie6msYaa	yeas they can, thas y u always, for the rest of your life use a retainer if u want perfect teeth. If u are considering to use braces, use Invisaliang instead, they are alot more conformable and since they are from the start a retainer, that you change over 2 weeks, you'll be more than use to wear a retainer, and they are more conformable. Plus they are INVISIBLE noone can notice u have them, they work faster too.|`|50cpycM8aa	nope braces don't change anything except your teeth! i wore mine for 3.5 years and my face didn't change at all.<br>  <br>  your teeth can become crooked if you don't wear your retainer every night, you'd be surprised at how easily they shift. so i wear mine faithfully every night, and haven't had a problem.|`|RVgQddmfaa	Kind of b/c you don't have a bunch of metal in your mouth after they are gone. but it won't change the shape of your face.<br>  <br>  Your teeth can go crooked again if you don't listen to the orthodontist and keep breaking your retainer.  Do what he/she says.  My bottom teeth had a retainer on them and I kept eating apples and such and three of them broke off b/4 they said, "No more."  Now my bottom teeth are crooked but not as bad as they used to be.  It's been about 30 years and the tops ones are still good.|`|x5jwrBzbaa	My face shape didn't change.<br>  <br>  Ur dentist guy will give u a plate to wear at night on ur top teeth so they don't move around, and they will put a wire on the back of the bottom teeth with that special concrete stuff so those ones don't move around.<br>  Don't worry though no-one will notice the wire, even you wont after a whiel :)
kKSq5VFKaa	Mind over Matter, It's a brain thing.<br>  You can control everything, such as emotions, pain and feelings These are your minds perceptions.<br>  Strength in over coming these can be done with focus and knowledge. Knowing that you have a pie in front of you that looks great and you want to eat it and knowing that you can eat it if you want to but you don't have to, it's your decision. Your decision is the strength behind all of this. Having the food in front of you is the factor, wanting to eat or not to eat is just a emotion and emotions are feelings. feelings are temporary in that sense. you can overcome feelings, the feelings of pain do not last forever, the feelings of hunger do not last forever. so viewing these as temporary, you know it's only a short time until it subsides. and viewing it this way you can over come.
9edd25b37861246574ffa754e91a83daaa	I get the same way so I understand perfectly. First of all, everyone else is nervous too. To relax though, get plenty of sleep the night before. Don't wait until the last minute to study, review small amounts at a time more than once until the exam. Don't take it on an empty stomach or you will not be able to concentrate. Most importantly, believe in yourself! The more prepared you feel, the more relaxed and less stressed you'll be. Hope this helps!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Talk to a school counselor, or to a psychologist outside of school.<br>  <br>  This is actually a form of anxiety. You can learn to reduce it, usually without medications of any kind. If your case is really severe, they might recommend short-term medication.|`|7sIYGEnmaa	I had the same problem and it was solved after visiting a psychiatrist. It's important to know that some people have a phobia/anxiety of taking exams and this can negatively affect your success. Since this can be diagnosed as a medical condition, your doctor may either prescribe a mild relaxant such as Valium that you would have to take before the exam. I was prescribed one and it worked like a charm. In addition, a doctor may write you a letter that requests that due to this condition the school should either give you a double-time or a separate room where external stimuli (like classroom setting, crowding that can cause phobia) won't be present. You should also check out for Attention Deficit Disorder if you chronically can't finish your exams on time .|`|8sB8ASncaa	You just need to breathe and realize this isn't life or death.

I have dark circles from lack of sleep also. One useful way is eat a lot of broccoli, it helps to get rid of them. Also drink extra fluids, that is useful too. Some even say putting teabags on your dark circles can help.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest that you get more sleep because even 8 hours isn't really enough.

Regardless of the cause, however, recent research has shown that skin creams containing these two ingredients reduce puffiness and discoloration significantly in many patients. Long-term daily use seems to have the greatest effect.|`|87pV5lvZaa	Many people go through life with dark circles under their eyes due to misconceptions about what causes them.<br>  <br>  Dark circles are actually mild bruises that are caused by rubbing the eyes.  This rubbing breaks the delicate capillaries under the skin, causing the bluish tint.<br>  <br>  The best way to get your dark circles to disappear is to stop rubbing your eyes. Although this is practically an involuntary action when humans are tired or have allergies, it can be stopped.<br>  <br>  You will not see immediate results, as your body must take time to heal the damaged capillaries, but be patient, and you should definitely see results!|`|rLzvq0aPaa	I was unhappy depressed and not eating well and not taking care of myself. Once I divorced my husband the circles went away!<br>  Seriously... Here is some really good onfo... Hope it helps.<br>  <br>  <br>  Definition<br>  What ages you most? Surprisingly, it might not be wrinkles or gray hair but dark circles under your eyes. Although dark circles under eyes usually aren't a sign of exhaustion or serious illness, they can make you feel old, unhealthy and tired. <br>  Causes<br>  If you get plenty of sleep, haven't been to a party in years and still have dark circles under your eyes, that's not unusual. Fatigue and high living aren't the main reasons for under-eye circles. What appear to be under-eye circles are sometimes just shadows cast by puffy eyelids or hollows under your eyes that develop as a normal part of aging. <br>  <br>  Here are some of the most common causes of true under-eye circles: <br>  <br>  Allergies <br>  Atopic dermatitis (eczema) <br>  Heredity — dark under-eye circles can run in families <br>  Lifestyle factors, such as smoking and drinking alcohol and caffeinated sodas <br>  Nasal congestion (which dilates and darkens the veins that drain from your eyes to your nose) <br>  Pigmentation irregularities — these are a particular concern for people of color, especially blacks and Asians <br>  Sun exposure, which prompts your body to produce more melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color <br>  Thinning skin and loss of fat and collagen — common as you age — which make the reddish-blue blood vessels under your eyes more obvious <br>  When to see a doctor<br>  Most often, dark under-eye circles aren't a medical problem, but if you want a more lasting solution than concealers and over-the-counter creams, see your dermatologist for advice. If discoloration and swelling appear under just one eye and seem to get worse over time, talk to your primary care doctor.

dpgXzMenaa	For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	good luck|`|OLy54IDOaa	to hurt|`|5je73V2Taa	i wouldn't say it'll hurt as much as girls think it's going to. I was nervous about having sex for the first time and so scared I wouldn't be able to walk afterwards, but when i finally did the deed, it was more uncomfortable then painful. I guess the best analogy for it, is like your skin stretching or having it pulled a little. It doesn't really hurt, just feels uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  My advice, relax, and have him go slow. Oh and don't be on top, it hurts more than being on the bottom. Also realize it'll most likely be uncomfortable the next 3 times you have sex as well. be safe. :)|`|isRDHbJgaa	It feels uncomfortable, with a little pain. You just feel like something is in there, it won't be the best sex you've ever had, but it will be the most memorable, so take your time and enjoy it.<br>  <br>  You should start with oral sex, so you can get in the mood and be relaxed.<br>  <br>  You don't have to wait til you are married, that is just immature, but please be smart about it.

It may hurt a little..you could try having him finger you a little first.  Only do a little at first, once you see that it's not excruiating pain then he can go in further.  I would not recommend him to put it all the way in the first few minutes as this could be the painful part and it can also bruise your cervix, which is usually where the blood comes from when people have sex for the first time, of course a little may come from breaking your hymen...unless you've done that yourself from masterbating.|`|N4ijiX2Caa	make sure the condom is lubricated and make sure you have lube just in case.<br>  my first time wasnt uncomfortable at all.. but then again, sometimes now it is uncomfortable. so just be prepared. make sure you take your time and enjoy it. it will get better the more you do it. oh and have fun, different positions make it great. missionary is awesome too.<br>  read cosmo, it helps with those creative positions.<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN!!!!!!<br>  woo hoo!!!|`|ny4qkoifaa	Make sure you put the condom on correctly!

2Z7u3Fksaa	Be sure when you shave down there that you are using a clean and new razor and use an aloe based shaving cream<br>  Also sometimes when the hair starts to grow back it will itch somewhat and thats normal<br>  But after you shave, use a nonscented lotion<br>  this should stop the irritation|`|mDMnhqwdaa	I use conditioner and it prevents it.|`|6rAV4c1raa	lmao i though i was the only dude who refered to da vaginer as chacha<br>  <br>  right on dude|`|AA11315360	I read in a womens magazine that you should always shave down there DOWNWARDS. This helps prevent ingrown hairs.<br>  Also I use shave cream or gel and a NEW razor every time. I was told by a doctor to use a fresh razor when I shave down there to prevent getting vaginal infections.<br>  Also if you shave every other day that helps reduce the itching. <br>  You might be allergic to the shave cream or gel you are using. Some make me itch and some dont. Try a shave CREAM next time. A different brand than what you use now.<br>  Noxema mens shave cream is nice. Cheap and works well. And it smells like their face wash! LOL|`|e3mf7sw6aa	This happens to me all the time.<br>  <br>  When I first started doing it..I would notice that hours later, it would start to feel stubbly - and always got annoyed.<br>  <br>  So I tried Nair - but ended up with about a million and one ingrown hairs all painful & itchy at the same time.<br>  <br>  The only advice I have in preventing it is to make sure that all the pores around the hair folicles are open (i.e. soak in the tub or shave at the end of your shower). Soaking in the warm water also softens the hairs. Then exfoliate the skin before you take a razor to it.<br>  <br>  That should help out a bit. <br>  <br>  I don't know the secret to fully preventing it myself, just yet....but I'm always looking. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	yeah i think that's normal for everyone.  think about it though, if you've ever dated a guy who was growing a beard he'll complain about it always being itchy.  try using unscented, uncolored lotion.  nothing with glitter or anything like that in it.  use unscented cocoa butter.|`|rId2HkN7aa	i do mine and it used to always itch,<br>  <br>  no one needs an itchy red chacha! <br>  <br>  so when you shave use a new razor and cream or lather up soap (i just use soap) let it grow back about 4 days and do it again, after 3 or 4 weeks of shaving every 4 days your body will get used to it and it stops (amen!) <br>  when you do it regular - no rash - no itch - no blotchiness - goooood luvin ;-)|`|AIy9xJOcaa	You shouldn't shave down there.  When the hair grows back, it causes days of discomfort.  You should have it waxed.  It will last longer and when the hair grows back, it won't prickle.  You can have it done at a salon.  They do a lot of these waxes so there's no need to feel embarrassed.  If that makes you uncomfortable though, you can just purchase a kit from a store and do it yourself.|`|N4ijiX2Caa	your panties may be too tight, or even your pants too. your chacha needs to breathe. also shave down not up when you do shave.<br>  also might be the fabric of your panties, silk or satin or velvet.<br>  mesh panties are awesome! the itchy part happens to me, and it's only because the hair is growing back and your coochie needs to breathe.<br>  good luck!|`|1UbM0OITaa	oh yes.... and i hate it... try some after shave lotions you can get for girls... or perhapes maybe use a newer razor when u shave it.... you should never use the same razor for your 'chacha' and your legs... use one blade for each and shave downwards first.... therefore your getting the longer parts and not getting as much cutting or small nicking|`|2trvwpqiaa	Make sure you don't shave against the direction of the hair.  Try shaving perpendicular the the growth pattern, it helps prevent razor burn.|`|koymw0cZaa	Always use hair removing cream its help you better.|`|thQE5LCxaa	Yes that is normal try a lotion|`|pcTMJvDaaa	Wax it!|`|6SpjiOAYaa	I think it's normal for it to feel itchy, I know other women who have had this problem.

This is called a sploof. When you take a hit, put your thumb or a bottle cap or something over your piece, (do not use joints/blunts) this is to put out the cherry so no smoke comes up out of the bowl. Blow your hits through the tube, by placing your mouth over the open end and exhaling. The smoke will smell like clean laundry and the room will smell even better!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps, 420!|`|sopAuW7Zaa	a really good fart usually conceals the smell of weed smoke. lol...i'm so not lying, either. <br>  <br>  but seriously, since he's a heavy smoker at present, then it's less likely for him to catch the scent of weed on you. you may even just be able to smoke a cig to mask the odor.<br>  <br>  I'd have been more worried if he wasn't a smoker at all. Non-smokers have a hightened sense of smell when it comes to that. So you're pretty lucky. lol|`|7eUTITNjaa	Dude, your not going to smell the mj if you smoke a cigarette. That will for sure cover it.

Especially if he has smoked for years and has destroyed his sense of smell.  Pot doesn't smell that much especially if you smoke cigs after.  I wouldn't worry.<br>  <br>  If your not a stripper or live in the ghetto stop smoking.  Its a lot easier when your young.  No decent guy will want to be seen with a girl that smokes.

dghUKNE6aa	Being a healthy eater requires you to become both<br>  educated and smart about what healthy eating <br>  actually is.  Being food smart isn't about <br>  learning to calculate grams or fat, or is it <br>  about studying labels and counting calories.<br>  <br>  Healthy eating is all about balanced and moderate<br>  eating, consisting of healthy meals at least <br>  three times per day.  Healthy eaters eat many<br>  different types of foods, not limiting themselves<br>  to one specific food type or food group.<br>  <br>  Eating healthy requires quite a bit of leeway.  You<br>  might eat too much or not enough, consume <br>  foods that are sometimes more or less nutritious.<br>  However, you should always fuel your body and <br>  your brain regularly with enough food to keep <br>  both your mind and body strong and alert.<br>  <br>  A healthy eater is a good problem solver.  Healthy<br>  eaters have learned to take care of themselves<br>  and their eating with sound judgement and making<br>  wise decisions.  Healthy eaters are always aware<br>  of what they eat, and know the effect that it <br>  will have on their bodies.<br>  <br>  When someone is unable to take control of their<br>  eating, they are also likely to get out of control<br>  with other aspects of life as well.  They could<br>  end up spending too much, talking too much, even<br>  going to bed later and later.  <br>  <br>  You should always remember that restricting food<br>  in any way is always a bad thing.  Healthy eating<br>  is a way of life, something that you can do to<br>  enhance your body or your lifestyle.  If you've<br>  thought about making your life better, healthy<br>  eating is just the place to start.  You'll make<br>  life easier for yourself, those around you, and <br>  even your family.|`|5nmvSXr4aa	Eat plants, avoid soda..<br>  <br>  You know what you should be doing, it's not rocket science.

15Bv8jGfaa	Everyone has a different body and metabolism.  Different things work for different people.  Something that might be worth trying is weaning yourself off of your pre-bed time eating.  Try eating 15 mins before bed for a week.  Then 20 mins before bed the next week.  Then 30 mins before bed the next, and so on.  <br>  <br>  If you are on some kind of eating plan and are exercising, as long as you aren't stuffing yourself with cookies before bed time, then you should be ok.  <br>  <br>  Another thing you could try is to eat supper three hours before bed but then have a small light snack (like 3 crackers with fat free cream cheese or some carrots) before bed.  <br>  <br>  You will probably find that you have trained your brain to expect food right before bed and without it, your tummy moans and complains until morning- so the problem may be purely psychological.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Try 6-8 oz of warm skim milk before retiring.
POFdWpUzaa	Who knows? A week isn't hardly long enough to know if this regimen will work for you. Everyone is different. You have to find the right equation for your life, ie, calories in, calories burned, your age and bone structure, etc.. Just keep experimenting with changes if you don't see the changes you want to see. You didn't gain a pound of muslce in one week. So check out your diet. It's really, really helpful to write down every single thing you eat, calculate the calories, keep track also of your exercise every day by writing it down and look back on this after a week. Then you'll have a better idea of what you need to tweek.|`|B12E4rYiaa	You need to pay close attention to your calorie intake eat only 1500 a day and keep track of all you eat and drink it adds up.

The body get used to things and doesn't respond anymore.|`|LN3LMIm1aa	You will absolutely lose weight. One thing to watch is your calorie intake. If you want to lose fat, a useful guideline for lowering your calorie intake is to reduce your calories by at least 500, but not more than 1000 below your maintenance level. For people with only a small amount of weight to lose, 1000 calories will be too much of a deficit. As a guide to minimum calorie intake, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends that calorie levels never drop below 1200 calories per day for women or 1800 calories per day for men. Even these calorie levels are quite low.|`|fOfqPATaaa	Well first off it sounds like your doing a great job.  That pound you gained is definitely muscle!

But did you know he has been contagious for 7 weeks now.  People are contagious 7 weeks before they come down with symptoms.  So if you've kissed him in the past 7 weeks you've already been exposed and more kissing isn't going to matter at this point.  <br>  <br>  Some people just don't catch mono though, no matter if they've been exposed or not.  A lot of people get it as children when the symptoms are mild and it just looks like a cold.  But when you get older you get worse symptoms like a bad sore throat, fever, and tiredness.<br>  <br>  You can only get mono one time.... that's it, you're immune for life.<br>  <br>  The worst will be over in a week.

QOyl6LxIaa	From your question it is understood that you are exhausted and have no energy.  No motivation.  Let us check one by one. O.K  Nothing is wrong with you.  It is everybody feels sometimes in life.  Dont give much importance to your desirous thoughts for a while which  normally occur in this agegroup.<br>  First - exhaustion.  It could be physically as well as mentally.  What ever it may be remedy - keep your self out from the routine and take rest and relax.  Go to a movie, or  to playground or to  a new place of interest  which appeals to you for relaxation.  Avoid drinking coffee,tea, or any other drinks.  Eat good food-fruits like plantain. guava, watermelon, Karbuja etc.,.  Go to a doctor and get presecribed for  medicine for supplementing goodhealth  For motivation think what you can become with your present talents and qualifications.  Choose your line and try to be the best of whatever you are.  Be a bush on the roadside if not a Mountain.  But you could be definitely something worth.  concentrate on your studies or work. Dont waste your time and thinking power on unnecessary things. Decide it for your self. Keep trying to become that one. The only watchword -  Yes I can do it. and I will do it.

There's bound to be someone in school who is better than you in something you hope to be great in.<br>  <br>  'The greatest revenge is to do something a person doubt you can achieve'<br>  Work towards that something and make that guy lose face!<br>  <br>  Be more competitive. You will find more things do so in life. You don't have to make a complex plan or list of goals you want to work forward to. Do it baby steps - every little goal achieved brings you to another goal to look to.<br>  <br>  If you are actually referring 'no energy' as a physical lack of energy instead of the lack of motivation for anything - sleep, daydream, eat chocolates ... just live your life carefree and in luxury for a while. Set a time every weekend, and hour or so, by just doing nothing. This will encourage you to reflect yourself.<br>  <br>  To conclude, here is a couple of quotes to motivate you:<br>  <br>  'All men dream but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find it was vanity; but dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes to make it possible'    -- T.E.

WJWW7NXaaa	If you're naturally not a morning person then to a certain extent you will always be a bit groggy in the morning. I'm the same way.<br>  <br>  Eating plenty of food like fresh fruit, cereals, porridge and juices in the morning will give you natural energy that lasts a lot longer than energy from caffeine or sugar. <br>  <br>  Try not to eat too late at night as if your body is digesting while you're asleep then you are not benefitting as much from that sleep. Don't go to bed hungry though, a light snack is always good before you go to bed. But starchy foods and foods rich in carbohydrates will keep your stomach working all night. <br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water too, I always find I sleep better when I do.|`|7sIYGEnmaa	You really need to have your full bloodwork + urine work done at a local M.D. office. You could have a Vitamin B or Iron deficiency that can make you feel tired. It could also be Goiter or Epstein Bar/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. If this problem is disrupting your life, the only way to find out is to have a full lab test.|`|R9NGT0nVaa	The way you wake up in the morning makes a HUGE impact on your day.

I would try a bland diet for awhile like brown rice, plain yogurt etc. It sounds like you may not have a good diet so if not fast food  and red meat will tear your stomach up. Alot of women don't have a regular b.m. so you might be plugged up maybe have a colonic.  Last year I discovered that I was allergic to whole milk and I had the same feeling if theres is something you eat or drink everyday it might be the cause.|`|139ggDwPaa	Your primary doctor should order a few tests..such as an upper GI or refer you to an internist who is specialty includes endoscopy (small scope passed into esophages) to look and evaluate what's going on in there...<br>  If you are not satisfied with your MD's diagnosis or lack there of, get a 2nd opinion...if condition worsens, seek medical attention in the emergency dept of your local hospital.

I have been on the pill for years and the same thing happened to me one time when I wasn't on the sugar pills.

xzwZ3lt3aa	That's an old wife's tale about going to sleep and never waking up. If you have a severe head injury you should get woken every hour or two, and asked simple questions like " what is your name?" If you have difficulty answering than obviously somethings not quite right in your brain.<br>  <br>  Are you showing signs of a concussion? Dizziness, loss of balance. headache, ringing in the ears, slurred speech, nausea or vomiting?  If none of those, put ice on your bump, and go to bed.
Sozc3MyFaa	I would check with the pediatrician and the oncologist.  Both the preemie & the person on chemo have vastly impaired immune systems so any infection is either one could be extremely serious.  But the very best place to get the correct info is from your two docs.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	I would assume this baby spent some time in nicu? Then, unless the baby is sick and unless the chemo has compromised the patient, there will be no problems. I get my blood tested every week and never have I had a problem with my blood. I've gotten sinus infections and colds, just like I would normally, and it has never progressed to anything more life threatening.|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	Both have impaired immune systems and are therefore vulnerable to infection, but it's not like the baby can catch cancer or the chemo patient can catch prematurity. The real people you need to worry about are the ones going out and exposing themselves to germs that they then bring home.

Here is what helped me lose 6 lbs in 2 weeks... eat when you''re hungry. Eat slow because it takes your body a few minutes to process that you're full. If you don't eat when you're hungry your body stores the fat from the next time you do eat which is not good. I also cut out meat, and cut back on dairy (cheese and milk products). I bought Newman's Own Organic Alphabet cookies so instead of eating a sugary mess for dessert I eat a couple of those.

9MEcOGOvaa	well defin. you should use something aerobic(that speeds up your heartrate).. like the stairmaster, treadmill, elliptical ..<br>  <br>  now that being said i'd personally recommend the elliptical since it works out more (ur arms, thigh, butt, lower back, and arms) for ur time.. not to mention since it does that it helps you burn more calories for your time working out...<br>  <br>  maybe work out about 2hrs a week however you want to do .. like two days one hour each.. or maybe 4 days 30min each<br>  <br>  then when you find that your starting to stay longer without getting so tired.. add a little more time .. also ... unlike common misconception you could work out with wieghts and not look all bulk u cant look very musclar only lean yourself and tighten (freeweights or machine) prob. since ur beginner i'd say machine weights..<br>  <br>  so the machine. like these-<br>  <a href="http://athletic-scholarships.net/gym%202..." rel="nofollow">http://athletic-scholarships.net/gym%202...</a><br>  <br>  try do work with a weight lets say 5lbs in which u can do lets say 10 times (each time you do one lets it's called repetition-rep for short..so<br>  <br>  10 reps when you complete these reps thats called one set...<br>  <br>  then rest.. for about 10-15sec..<br>  <br>  then another 10 times.. (so ur starting on ur 2nd set.)<br>  <br>  etc.. for the first day and try to increase about 1 rep every time.. then when u about doubled the amount of reps.. increase the sets<br>  <br>  for ex. after a while u will do<br>  1set of 20<br>  2nd set of 20<br>  <br>  then u will add a third set.. and lets say increase it to 5 more reps.. then increase this one till it gets to 20 then and then once u have 3 sets of 20 reps.. or 4 u add more weight.. to lets say to 10lbs..<br>  <br>  and so on<br>  the key is to keep increasing when ur body adapts.. like in time when it comes to aerobic, and increase reps and weights and sets..BUT AT YOUR OWN PACE..

Since your a vegetarian, that will help tremendously.<br>  <br>  Activity for at least a minimum of 30 minutes a day, I would push this to at least an hour since your taking weight gaining medication. Develop a program, and this includes cleaning, gardening, as long as your physically active, but exercise is always the best.<br>  <br>  The diet part is the most important, try eating low carb foods that wont turn into fat. Sugars, starches such as bread and pastas. Saturated fat such as deep fried foods. It is always better to eat a lot of smaller meals and snacks to build up your metabolism so you can burn calories.<br>  <br>  I dont know what your eating, but eat more fruits and vegetables if you can when you get hungry, I know it is the same old song and dance but it is true. But since your a vegetarian, I dont think this is your problem but do it if your not. If your eating good, simply exercise and do more daily activities to burn calories.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|b1hXdKHCaa	Well, high protein, low carbs (not NO carbs) is best, but I don't know how many protein options being a vegetarian leaves you.<br>  <br>  When you do eat carbs, absolutely no white or enriched flours. Complex carbs such as rice, potatoes and yams are best for you.<br>  <br>  Make sure to get plenty of vegetables in. Greens, such as lettuce are "freebies" - eat as much as you'd like.<br>  <br>  Reduce and monitor your caloric intake and useage.

This is a great site: <a href="http://caloriecount.about.com" rel="nofollow">http://caloriecount.about.com</a><br>  <br>  Eat 6 small meals a day - this will keep your intake steady and your body won't tend to store as much snce it's accustomed to being fed frequently.

Many doctors are very knowledgeable to herbs/vitamins/natural supplements and will be able to help you out there. You don't know if something will negatively interact with a medication you are already using, by causing it not to work or causing a negative reaction to your health. Also, speak with your physician(s) about the medication making you gain weigh and try to work something out with another medication that doesn't do this. If that's not possible, speak with them about how to lose weight in your case. Otherwise, you may just be stuck with the extra weight until you can get off the medication, change medication, or learn to live with it and just be as healthy as you can...you can still be fit, you know, without losing the extra pounds. Maybe you should concentrate on that and do your best to get the exercise your doctor suggests, cut your daily calories back a little at a time, and you might just be pleasantly surprised!!

KPDOrmTsaa	They're all about the same except of course those with sugar or fruit which would be higher carbohydrate.<br>  Any of the cereals whether hot or cold are healthy, yet oats are preferred.|`|F08HDRvraa	The oatmeal is going to be healthier as it is less processed, but the cold cereals do have vitamins added.|`|I7sS4w0maa	Oatmeal.. There is more fiber in oatmeal than regular cold cereal|`|LN3LMIm1aa	Eating a bowl of oatmeal each morning is the perfect way to start your day off right. This article will explain the six benefits of eating oatmeal.<br>  <br>  First off, the oatmeal discussed here is not the instant kind that comes in the different flavors — these are full of sugar. The real stuff is the plain oat flakes from Quaker Oats or a similar brand.<br>  <br>  The benefits of oatmeal are due to the fact that it's made from oats and oats are a good source of both soluble and insoluble fiber.<br>  <br>  According to the American Cancer Society:<br>  <br>  1. Insoluble fiber's cancer-fighting properties are due to the fact that it attacks certain bile acids, reducing their toxicity.<br>  <br>  2. Soluble fiber may reduce LDL cholesterol without lowering HDL cholesterol. LDL is bad; HDL is good.<br>  <br>  3. Soluble fiber slows down the digestion of starch. This may be beneficial to diabetics because, when you slow down the digestion of starch, you avoid the sharp rises in your blood sugar level that usually occur following a meal.<br>  <br>  4. It has been found that those who eat more oats are less likely to develop heart disease, a disease that is currently widespread in the United States.<br>  <br>  5. The phytochemicals in oat may also have cancer-fighting properties.<br>  <br>  6. Oats are a good source of many nutrients including vitamin E, zinc, selenium, copper, iron, manganese and magnesium. Oats are also a good source of protein.|`|15Bv8jGfaa	Oatmeal, definitely.  There is no added sugar and the roughage in oats is absolutely awesome to help keep your system in working order.

It's more than enough to keep you in health, to lose weight and to build lean muscle mass into your body.<br>  <br>  Try not to restrict too excessively in what you eat - the ultimate call is to eat a healthy, well-balanced, nutritious diet that promotes weight loss. <br>  <br>  What I want to say is this - more (on exercise and dieting) doesn't mean it's good.|`|AA11357422	Over doing anything can have its harmful effects. There are such things as over-training, so you better be careful with your tendons, joints and muscles. At the rate you are going & competing with an "enhanced" enthusiast such as your friend, you might injure your self. Because the stuff hes taking might be helping him recover faster and better than you...and that's something you really cant compete with.<br>  <br>  I can see that you have a tendency towards addictive behaviors, so this is where you need to be careful and stay away from the red line that you like to push.<br>  I think you need to talk to someone about why you need to have your heart rate at such high levels. That is totally counter intuitive to what our body wants to do be as efficient as possible. So this is more a mental issue than a physical issue. <br>  Your heart can handle it until you have a heart attack due to lack of recovery time between heavy exercise bouts.|`|vA2Eqh81aa	I think the excessive heart reate could be harmful if you do it too much..

Because you're not putting toxins or junk food into your body like you were before and you're being active you don't have the chemicals that would make running an unhappy chore.

Almost euphoric. <br>  <br>  Its GOOD for you! =)<br>  <br>  As long as your meals are balanced enough to where you aren't losing an unhealthy amount of weight, you're good!<br>  <br>  Keep at it!

It really depends on the condition of your teeth.<br>  <br>  But if you do have to get them, I don't think it will affect your "scene" image. <br>  <br>  You could even get some cool colored ones and think of them as an accessory.

2Ltc1dAwaa	You are cold because you have poor blood circulation.  <br>  <br>  If you are underweight, thi might contribute to being cold all the time.  <br>  If you can let me know your statistics...height and weight, etc. That would help. <br>  <br>  But I know that my hands and feet are always cold, no matter what.  I am underweight and that is a result of my low blood pressure.  <br>  <br>  I have something called Reynaud's Disease: its a severe reaction to temperature in the extremities.  My hands and feet turn purple becuase they are cold.  <br>  <br>  Also, you may improve your bodily state if you increase your cardiovasuclar activity: this will get the blood and oxygen pumping all over your body and generate more heat.  It will increase your heart rate and increase your metabolism so that your body is constantly being fueled.  <br>  <br>  It also depends on your diet.  Depends on the type of foods you are eating and whether you are lacking any vital nutrients.  <br>  <br>  You might want to see your doctor to let him know.

80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	I went thru a period of depression after I got out of college and could not find a job - spent almost a year looking.  And then, things got worse.  Took me a long time to even come up with a way out.<br>  <br>  What I did may not agree with what you should do or what your doctors would suggest, but still...?<br>  <br>  I first said, things couldn't get much worse could they?  And they couldn't.<br>  <br>  2nd, instead of focusing on how miserable I was - I started trying to find 1 nice thing that happened each day - just 1 nice thing.  And when I came home from work, or had idle time at work - I thought about that nice thing.  And sure enough, some nice things had been happening to me - but I was so busy focusing on how miserable I was - that I was not noticing the nice things.  I'm not talkig about winning the lottery.  But small nice things - like someone holding a door open for me or finding a table to eat at during lunchtime in the cafeteria. I wrote down the nice things in a journal each day.  When I got depressed, I would read my journal.<br>  <br>  After a while, I started noticing that more than one nice thing happened each day.  After a while, I stopped the journal.<br>  <br>  I can also remember (this was over 30 years ago) a story I read in Readers Digest.  Read about some guy who was having a hard time and he decided instead of focusing on his problems that he would help others.  And as a result, he did better.  I tried tha and  it worked for me - it gave me other things to focus on - and I learned I could make a difference.<br>  <br>  Would suggest you do a couple of other things as well.  Find something you like, that you can volunteer at - Big Sister, working at a food kitchen, etc.  Doesn't really matter what it is - as long as you are helping others.  And instead of setting home thinking about how miserable you are, you will be out doing something.  The more active you are, you'll start feeling better.<br>  <br>  As you start to make changes, set goals.  But don't just think them - write them down and read your list at least at the start of the day - and before you go to bed at night.  Instead of saying, you want to lose 50 pounds set a smaller goal - something that you can achieve in a small amount of time - like lose 3-5 pounds.  I've read that people can lose as much as 12 pounds in a year by cutting out sodas.  For me, hard to do but I keep trying.  I've gone down from 4 a day to one.  Which is an improvement - not to mention the money I'm saving.|`|EkAVgCWFaa	buy an ipod (if you can afford one)..<br>  put all your favorite songs on it, and go running for two hours a day.<br>  if its hard for you to run, then walk intill your in better shape to run.<br>  <br>  and this helps me: whenever im running, i think about all my stress, all my anger, my issues, my work, people who annoy me, bitches, evil people.. and just take it out on running.<br>  <br>  therse really no secret to determination and being motivated.<br>  its all up to you, this is your life, and its ending one minute at a time..

As for the differences it involves education and who is able to prescribe medication if need be.  That being said the more education they have the more expensive that they are going to be.  Normally in your first therapy session it is more about getting to know you then actually diving into any problem areas that you may be having.

It makes the pill less effective.<br>  <br>  When I was resisting taking prescription medication, my doctor suggested to me that I take more Vitamin D, you can take suppliments as well as get it naturally from sun light.  And he said to take SamE.  You can find that in the suppliment section of a drug store.  <br>  But please, do your research first and then ask your doctor what he thinks before started to take them.|`|aEKI1Knqaa	You may already be aware of this but, marijuana is an excellent treatment for anxiety. Marijuana has been used for centuries as medicine and in 1996 was approved for medical use. It is currently legal in 13 states and if you live in a state where it is legal you should definitely look into it. You can visit www.canorml.org for more information. Marijuana is by far a better choice over prescription drugs such as Prozac and Lexapro and many other anti anxiety medications as it has no harmful side effects.

Take a road trip.  It's a great way to get your mind off your problems.<br>  2.  If you spent way too much time with your bf, then go to an exercise class, or gym and work off your stress and gradually meet people.<br>  3.  Do something you like, whether it involves meeting new people or not:  listen to music, read, play guitar, knit, anything YOU like.  It will make you feel better.  Not only that, but you might find other people who like what you like.<br>  4.  Talk to people you trust.  You need support right now.  So, if it is a friend, a parent, a counselor, a minister, just get some support.<br>  5.  Believe in yourself.  You don't need to get dragged down by the painkillers your bf is taking.  He needs to get help, so give him the space to do that.  You can still encourage him, but you don't have to let it stop you from moving on and developing yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|YM03OVi8aa	Hm, the first few weeks are gonna be hard, but i think the best explanation of this is when you talk to this person, your body gets a raise in endormines ( feel good hormones), and now that ur not seeing them, ur body is so use to it then it hits a low, (for every high theres a low). Your feeling this way because ur so use to this feeling, it'll take a bit of time to just get that feeling away. If you know ur not going to talk to him again i would suggest deleting his phone so ur not tempted, and try to hide things that u kept from him to keep u from thinking about him. Our brain are the ones to do benefit from those hormones so obiviously they want them back. Good luck.|`|tqkISgeDaa	me and my girlfriend of 4 years just broke up and it's going to be very hard.

AA11611389	Actually the oil is not a bad thing to do.  As the day progresses you should shift gradually from carbs to fats (with protein at all meals).  Many dieters make the mistake of trying to eliminate fats which actually causes your body to try to save the fat it has.  Other ways to get that are:  nuts, a spoonful of peanut butter, avocado, or eggs with the yolks. <br>  <br>  I would try to get more nutrient packed veggies instead of the lettuce though, like broccoli, spinach, kale, cauliflower, etc.|`|85KrSJh3aa	What you need is a proven system that is natural and permanent.

And what the hell is with the olive oil?  That would make me throw up.
RqcLxDesaa	Keep moving, gently stretch and try Nuprin or Advil. And drink lots of water. Soreness is to be expected after a workout you described. If you do this routinely, your muscles will get used to it.
f2d89272f3e228493a1f7ea002fea3efaa	Its acid reflux.  The longer you let it go, the more it will hurt your esophagus.  You need to at least take some Tums or Maalox to make it stop, Tums work pretty quickly.  Sometimes you will get chest pain and throat pain with this.  Make sure you arent eating acidy foods or things like garlic or chocolate, or any caffeine when this is happening, it makes things way worse.  Also you can raise the head of your bed a few inches to help keep the acid in your stomach while you sleep.|`|iM1j8I9Haa	It sounds like heartburn or acid reflux but it could also be a sign of an ulcer.  See a doctor and he will find out if you need a prescription to take care of it.  Tums will help but long term you need to make sure you don't hurt your esophagus or the lining of your stomach.  Nexium is a great acid reducer & not that expensive.<br>  Good luck!
iqGaNZTtaa	Just water is OK..sips...not too much.|`|uC75y83Taa	If the doctor just said not to eat, then you can drink water.  Otherwise he would've said don't eat or drink.

They should know for sure.<br>  Bless you and good luck!  :)

It totally transformed my life. No more panic attacks, absolutely amazing! You just can’t imagine what this has done for my life. The changes in me are nothing short of miraculous.<br>  You too could benefit from these audio programs. It is a learning system to condition the conscious and unconscious mental patterns that will allow you to rise above your current limitations and to embrace and achieve your goals. It starts with a brief relaxation session at the beginning of each programs, to produce the optimal state of mind for learning and retention with 55-60 beat per minute music to further reduce stress while lowering brain waves into the alpha and theta levels followed by special pace and repetition of re-scripting statements. <br>  What they do for you is significantly alter your automatic mental processes, which start working in days and produces lasting, growing results that continue to improve every aspect of your life as the weeks and months go by. <br>  It will work wonders for you, too. No more depression, no more paralyzing panic attacks. No more runaway fears. No more obsessing over matters large and small.<br>  <br>  Hope this will help you change your ways of thinking to a positive attitude towards life. <br>  Best wishes, K-Loc

0KGJRVMNaa	I'm so pissed at like 90% of these answers. It isn't necessary for ANYONE to shave anything, it's a choice. These idiots are just going along with our f*cked up, judgemental, ignorant society, and that is so f*cking annoying. Don't even listen to them.<br>  <br>  You can shave if you want to, it's your choice. You don't need to be a god damn swimmer to remove some of your body hair, you aren't going to be gay and it is not only for women.<br>  Should you shave? Nobody SHOULD. Could you shave?

0TT5q0cUaa	controlling the diet and emotional stress usually relieves the symptoms.<br>  <br>  Diet <br>  Increasing the fibre in the diet often helps, although sometimes a decrease in fibre is needed. Eating smaller meals more often helps. <br>  The doctor may ask for a food diary to be maintained to see if eating a particular food, for example, milk or cabbage worsens the symptoms.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stress <br>  The doctor will help identify things that cause stress and will suggest ways to help control them. Relaxation techniques may help manage stress. <br>  <br>  <br>  Medicines <br>  The doctor may prescribe a combination of bulk-forming agents (such as methylcellulose), antispasmodic drugs, and tranquilizers or antidepressants. <br>  As IBS is a chronic disorder, symptoms may flare-up throughout life. Although a cure has not been found yet, the disorder can usually be controlled. IBS will not progress to anything worse like cancer.<br>  <br>  Following these guidelines help relieve you:<br>  <br>  Learning stress-management techniques to reduce stress and anxiety. Professional counselling may be helpful. <br>  <br>  Drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. <br>  <br>  Avoiding alcohol, which can make symptoms of IBS worse. <br>  <br>  Selecting foods carefully. If a food appears to bring on symptoms, avoid it. Be sure that a food produces symptoms several times before you give it up. You should try to keep many different foods in your diet because a varied diet provides better nutrition. <br>  <br>  Ask your doctor if you should have a high-fibre diet, especially if you tend to be constipated. High-fibre foods may cause gas and bloating, but usually these symptoms lessen as the digestive tract gets used to the increased fibre. Some high-fibre foods include:<br>  whole-grain breads and cereals <br>  <br>  fruits, especially apricots, blackberries, coconut, peaches, pears, pineapple, and strawberries <br>  <br>  nuts, especially almonds, pistachios, and walnuts <br>  <br>  vegetables, particularly sprouts, corn, popcorn, beans <br>  <br>  eat smaller meals more frequently. Eat smaller portions of foods at a meal.|`|AA10481903	Did your doctor determine the CAUSE of your IBS?  Did he/she test you for Celiac Disease?  Leaky Gut Syndrome?

Ohd9dA3oaa	bad carbs because they are simple carbs, its just sugar that contributes to the carb total. Fruits/Veggies/whole grain are good carbs because they are complex and keep you full for longer while simple carbs from this iced tea will make you hungry again soon because it gives off quick energy|`|iC190dpfaa	Your Arizona Ice Tea consists solely of "fast digesting" carbs.  Which means they'll run through your system quickly (leaving you unsatisfied/wanting more) and the fast digesting carb is more likely to convert into fat.  However!  Fast carbs are GOOD immediately following a workout as the body is starving for energy to replace what you've burned off.  So drink up after a weight session or a run, ect.|`|SB4N01OOaa	The carbs in rasberry iced tea are probably from sugar, and too much sugar is bad. So you'll want to drink it in moderation.<br>  <br>  In general good carbs come from whole wheat/grain products and vegetables. Fruits have a lot of sugar as well, but fresh fruit is very different from fruit flavored drinks.

1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	108 pounds is way too thin for someone your height.  Plus, your actions and overall well being is extremely indicative of someone with anorexia.  You may not be purposely trying to starve yourself.  There may be a reason behind why you don't want to eat.  "Anorexia" literally means "a loss of appetite".  But, you need to figure out with your therapist and physician why you don't or can't eat.|`|l7SOsdiOaa	Disregard the person who said "absolute" anorexia nervosa.  You realize your eating is not healthy, you don't have body image issues, and you're willing to improve your eating; those are huge steps in the right direction.  Your statements imply that you do eat regularly; you just don't feel like making yourself snacks between meals.  So, that leaves us with the weight loss- 12 pounds in three months is significant for your weight and age.  Depression can lead to lack of interest in food and well-being and may have contributed to your eating habits; as can endocrine disorders (hormones and eating habits directly affect your menstrual cycle).  The dizziness is likely from hypoglycemia.  Until you see your doctor, make sure to eat something with a high sugar content when you feel dizzy.  Failing to do this could lead to fainting or neurological symptoms.  Also, if you are going to be active (tennis?), you must force yourself to eat properly beforehand; even if it requires extra effort!|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Absolute anorexia nervosa.
dghUKNE6aa	Detoxification is the process of removing toxic substances from the body. Primarily referred to as a treatment for alcohol and drug dependence, body detox can also refer to the use of diets, herbs and other methods to remove toxins from the body for general health. <br>  <br>  So, are you thinking of cleansing your body? Here are a few tips for healthy and wise and effective detoxification. <br>  <br>  Go for a non-toxic lifestyle. This means going for natural food, drinking lots of fluids, especially water, exercising regularly and avoiding toxic food like junkfood, canned good, and other processed food. At the same time, you can try out a Detox Diet that will cleanse your body and give relief to body aches, allergies, digestive problems and other related concerns. <br>  <br>  If you’re on a detox program, take as much fresh fruits and vegetables as possible, nuts, beans, rice and grains. On the other hand, take note not to indulge in sugar, caffeine, yeast, alcohol, chocolates and other food rich in additives and preservatives. <br>  <br>  Plan your detox program. You can do a weekend fast. It is good to start on a Friday, with the weekend giving you the transition in and out of your detox program. Likewise, make sure that your detox plan is something that you can follow. Detoxifying does not mean starving yourself. <br>  <br>  Appreciate nature. Exercise outdoors. The fresh air can do wonders for your lungs and circulation. If you live near the beach, it’s always good to take a walk or sprint early morning by the seashore. Have a balanced schedule of activity that will give you time for work and fun at the same time. Try yoga or pilates. Skip rope or walk in your neighborhood. Do anything to keep that body of yours up and running and always on the go. <br>  <br>  Go for the spa. Take a shower and do skin brushing to help you detoxify. Rubbing your skin improves circulation and helps you shed off those dead skin layer. <br>  <br>  Make sure that you have a regular bowel movement. Eat food rich in fiber. There’s also tea and other herbs which can help aid bowel movement. When you’re detoxifying, bowel movement is important as it lessens the possibility of toxins being absorbed into the body. <br>  <br>  Be positive. A healthy mind means a healthy body. Rid yourself of all negative thoughts. They’re added toxins to the body. Smile and have the will and the commitment to your detox plan.|`|DbGA7BMHaa	The Cranberry juice is a good start, but you should also get a colon cleanser, apparently your colon collects all of this toxic sludge and it is not good for you, now as to the best, talk to a health food store expert, I had to get some to go with m Acai Berry diet, but mine doesn't seem to do anything.

L1FUcmb0aa	Okay, some progressive relaxation can probably help you out. First, try to blank out your mind. Then, while breathing slowly, curl your toes in, count slowly to five, and let go. Then stretch your calves, count slowly to five, and let go. Do the same with your thighs next. Make sure to keep your breathing slow during this. Then, compress your abs and squeeze you butt in as tight as you can (so much that you go up in your bed a little), count to five seconds, and stop. You should feel the energy draining in the body parts that you compressed before, and they will warm up. Then, squeeze your chest and shoulders in, count slowly to five, and let go. Then, flex you biceps, hold for a count to five, and let go. Tighten your fists with the same pattern. Then, squeeze you face in for the same time, acting as you are resisting someone to feed you with all you have. After this, just leave your mind empty and breathe slowly.

sxahupRTaa	Hmmm....I had a very rough time growing up. My father was extremely mentally abusive to me and my mother. One of the things that helped me was the school counselor. Also, making friends, and finding people with common interests can help to relieve stressful situations. Physcial activity can also help if counseling is not a viable option for you. My best advice to you though is to take your parents aside and say Mom, Dad, I am having some troubling thoughts and I think I need to talk to someone about them. Throughout my short life I have found that honesty generally tends to be the best policy....hope this helps....|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Just sit down and tell them or tell the one your most comfortable with,who's more understanding, and who'll listen and tell them you can't really explain how your feeling but your having suicidal thoughts and you really really need to see a therapist for help.<br>  *But also keep in mind it's better to go to an therapist and psychiatrist.When dealing with depression medication and therapy is the key to overcome it for most people.Talk to your psychiatrist and let him/her decide what's best for you.Good luck|`|RXI8ImdIaa	mental health is actually more important than braces. <br>  <br>  If you can't bring yourself to talk to them about it, then ask to go to your regular doctor for something.

n5OIrGIRaa	I am nearsighted too. I think that might because of the improper wearing of the contact lens. I don't think it is anything major ( I really hope not), at least she is not losing vision field or seeing distorted picture.However i think you should get her to check the back of the eyes to make sure there is nothing wrong. <br>  <br>  Nearsighted persons have increased risk for glaucoma and rentina detachment, so routine check is always good. It all can be fixed if you detect earlier.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

If apoptosis was working correctly, then the damaged cancerous cells would've died before they could divide and start any trouble.<br>  <br>  Scientists have been working for years on developing drugs to do exactly what you're describing but it's not as simple a process as you seem to think.

DFJ9m4WKaa	Guys get erections while they sleep because as they sleep their brain fire randomly (as part of the sleep cycle). This sends signals to the genitals to get aroused. Each night a guy experiences an average of 6 erections. The other reason a guy can get an erection while he sleeps is if fluids build up in the bladder, it can put enough pressure against the prostate to induce an erection. But that is not an absolute either.<br>  <br>  In fact a guy who does not have regular erections at night should see a doctor.|`|1dI1QiVJaa	i wanted to answer ur ? but everyone here gave really good answers and basically said the same thing i would've said,   WE  guys usually donut wet the bed as u said but we can have a wet dream if u know what that is,  and if we are dreaming of something sexy etc then that's when it  can happen.

3977ddaa641eba89d5c341a64e316ab8aa	First of all, I too myself have acne but I don't fret as much as you.<br>  (By the way, fretting about it contributes to stress, am I right?)<br>  <br>  I'm 16 and I had acne since 12 years or so. I used plenty of facial washes and creams but they only worked temporarily or for a short period of time.<br>  I have acne not just on my face but on my back, on my chest and shoulders. Still want to compare?<br>  <br>  Fortunately, there are some points to know regarding acne. Here are some:<br>  <br>  Greasy food hasn't been scientifically linked to acne.<br>  Stress do contribute to acne.<br>  Get enough of sleep. Every hour of sleeplessness adds up to your sleep-debt. A 30 minute sleep in the afternoon is thought to be equivalent to an hour sleep at night.<br>  Do not ever scratch, poke, pick and roughly scrub your face. You risk scarring your face and prone to infection.<br>  Acne is hereditary. If your parents had acne, you more likely do so.<br>  Acne is common for teenagers at the age of 13-18. By 20, the individual has gone through puberty and the acne recesses. <br>  Do something to make you sweat. Sweating is the body's natural exfoliating process of getting rid of bacteria, dead skin cells and dirt of the skin. After doing a sport, wash up and your body is fresh, clean an rejuvenated!<br>  <br>  <br>  Why do you need hormone pills for?! Your 16-17 and your hormones are still raging! A myth affecting hormones. Myth. Why did you believe a myth? Unless you can show me an abundance of evidence regarding milk and it affecting hormones, you should be drinking plenty of milk at this age - calcium is very important.<br>  <br>  You know what you should not do - worrying to much about your acne. Focus on other things to keep your mind off your acne. It may not sound simple as there is your self-image to look after but what about your self-worth?<br>  I know, I too myself occasionally worry about my acne-ed face but acne will disappear and your regrets earlier in life won't.<br>  <br>  My advice and the advice that I put myself into is:<br>  <br>  Leave the acne, and the acne will leave you.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.

If you have health insurance you can go to your own primary care doctor and ask him for some topical face creams such as differen gel or other creams.

For this, you need to understand WHY you are eating.  If there are no emotional or stress related issues, perhaps you are lacking a vitamin of some kind and your body is craving it- it then makes you crave all kinds of food in its desperate search for the required nutrient.  For this, you should see a doctor.  They can do a blood test to determine what it is you may be lacking.

Gw1LLzDgaa	I think you are asking whether we are against ROUTINE infant circumcision.<br>  <br>  If that is your question, then the answer is yes.<br>  <br>  I was circumcised at about 2 (I was premature and too small to circumcise when I was born).  I REMEMBER the aftermath.  Furthermore, I have never quite felt whole in that area.  I believe I was robbed of part of what natural, and I think that is immoral.  We as a society disparage female circumcision -- but embrace male circumcision.  We should not.<br>  <br>  If boys want, once they are adults, to be circumcised, they should be -- but they should not be cut due to outdated and false ideas from a century ago -- which is what happens in America -- NOR should they be cut due to their parents' religions.<br>  <br>  Kind thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|i6RlYFo7aa	against it<br>  <br>  it is completely unnecessary, and before anyone brings up the tired "hygiene" issue: neither is cleaner than the other, both cut and natural guys need to wash their ween to stay clean, FYI the circumcision wound can get infected and create complications|`|zLUQJxJkaa	I am neither. It's unnecessary but at the same time there's no difference except looks. I don't really care either way. It doesn't feel different, it doesn't work different, and it doesn't stay healthy better. It just looks different.<br>  People can do what they wish.. I'll stay out of it. I think it's immature to argue for or against it though.. if you really don't like it then don't have it done, and if you really like it then go ahead and have it. Don't bug each other about it, and please don't include me haha.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Against it when done to infants or kids (adults should be able to choose). It's cruel and unnecessary and not beneficial.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|srUuoCwcaa	I'm ethically against its performance on newborns and infants. <br>  <br>  It is completely superfluous. Even the American Pediatric Association (which, compared to its European and Canadian counterparts, was rather late to the ball) affirmed this very fact when it issued its 1990 policy statement on the procedure, stating that there is absolutely "no justification for routine neonatal circumcision" in males.<br>  <br>  There IS a slight statistic variance between the two groups as regards urinary tract infections and penile cancer. However, this is only by a meager 1%, and again and again research has affirmed that proper hygiene can eliminate all said risks. <br>  <br>  Beyond merely its superfluity, there remains also the issue of bodily intergrity. Human autonomy and dignity should be protected in all civilized nations. But allowing a couple to consent to an unnecessary medical procedure which physically alters the sexual anatomy of a helpless child--permanently, I might add--is no more than to spit upon the ideals of human autonomy and bodily integrity. <br>  <br>  There are other issues sometimes raised, such as the fact that the removal of the foreskin inevitably results in the glans' keratinization (said to reduce sensation), the large number of individuals (myself included) who feel psychologically distressed and even at times resentful because of having unwillingly endured the procedure, the lack of effective topical pain relivers, etc. But I think what I listed above is that which is most fundamental.<br>  <br>  My stance is not that of an outside observer. It is from someone who feels considerable pain at having been subjected to circumcision (so much so that I am considering surgical options for the future) and also from someone who believes very strongly in the natural ideal for man: human life as God and Nature intended it to be, not as we in our silly innovations saw fit to redirect it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. : )|`|1CUqkJgEaa	Against it- Please do not compare this to the removal of the clitoris and mutilation of the labia in Western Asia and Africa because that is being overly dramatic. However, this procedure is totally pointless as all "benefits" have been thoroughly debunked or made obsolete with the condom. Plus, when you do this to a baby, it gives him so much pain that the sensory nerves overload and the baby passes out. It is horrifying.|`|FnDz57xRaa	first, a girl should have nothing to say about this unless it has to do with how she thinks it looks.<br>  <br>  second, uncut has an unappealing look. <br>  <br>  i was uncut as a boy and decided to have a circumcision during puberty and it was something i never had a second thought about.  i was much happier and never had to worry if a girl was turned off by the look of it.  i am much more confident now.<br>  <br>  lastly, who wants to deal with smegma accumulation.  thats just gross|`|OGiSHHZaaa	against and it is cleaner for a baby guy how can you keep saying it's not? the foreskin can get infected on a newborn even if a tiny amount of urine is trapped.

If they refer to female circumcision as Female Genital Mutilation, please follow through and refer to male circumcision in the same light.<br>  Can you tell I am against this barbaric custom?  There is no reason to circumcise other than the doctors want to promote it because they make lots of money doing it.  Intelligent research has shown all the reasons people used to circumcise for to be false information.  A foreskin is a part of the natural penis, and not something to be cut off and sold to a cosmetic giant to test make-up on.

AA11524272	Be with him and do simple things like watching TV or videos. Ask him questions about things you are interested in and listen to him as he answers. There is nothing a father enjoys more than teaching a son or daughter and seeing him or her learn. That will make your father proud and happy. Also, do things you know he likes and most importantly be a good girl and do the right thing always. Don't remind him that he is sick. He already knows that and maybe he doesn't want to talk about it because he doesn't want you to worry. Just hug him as often as you can and, if possible, do many things with him. If you have the chance and if he's in the condition you can play a ball game or go the park or something. The important thing is that you make your father happy and proud of you. Don't give him hard times and do not do things that will disappoint him.<br>  <br>  My best wishes for your dad. I hope he gets well.<br>  <br>  I forgot: I agree with the person who recommends letting you dad know that you already know that he is sick. Let him know that you know so he stops trying to pretend everything is OK. Tell him that you would like to help him and that you are very proud of him for his decision to fight cancer. Also, let him know that, despite your age, you want to know about how things go, so he doesn't keep all the stress. He will find a way to let you know how things go.

nzWux9Meaa	Yeah, I agree that the two main things in losing Weight are working out and eating healthy. The main type of exercise you should be doing is cardio cardio cardio. All I know is that I hated cardio and still do, but hey it really does work. I feel that running is the best and most obvious choice, but I will give you a tip that I do. Lets say you want to run for fifteen minutes. What you should do is split the running times into five minutes followed by five minutes of fast paced walking. Since your heart is still pounding fast from the run when you walk you are still doing excellent cardio without the extra work. This basically doubles your original amount of cardio time from fifteen minutes to thirty minutes. The one workout program that I have been hearing nothing but excellent reviews from is the P90X program. I know a lot of people who have lost wieght with it. And another thing, try doing strength training before you do your cardio. This will cause your body to burn your muscle energy which will force your body to burn stored energy(fat). The muscle energy is basically the calories you ate that day.Here is a calorie intake calculator www.mayoclinic.com/health/calorie-calcul... <br>  It is great to see that you want to get back in shape. Good Luck!|`|FYUHJyvpaa	It's true that losing weight can be frustrating - hence the appeal of programs that promise easy weight loss.

Plus, it depends on Dr.'s willingness and lab tech's skill. <br>  <br>  For that reason, you might need denture adhesive and persistance to visit dentist very often to adjust and reline your denture until you feel comfortable. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, if you have partial denture, it's very easy to fit to your mouth firmly as long as doctor diagnosed it correctly and lab makes very good framework.<br>  <br>  any way, don't have too much expection.|`|FMajZYS2aa	Depend on the condition of your gum and your skill.

Without being uncomfortably tight.|`|AA11315360	Yes but you may need to use denture adhesive to make it feel better. Also as time goes on without teeth in your mouth, you lose bone level. So you have to have a check up yearly to make sure your dentures still fit correctly. After 5-10 years you may need new dentures.

There are people that are in their twenties that weigh 135 that can bench press 350. If you are looking to increase your bench press max you need to be working out heavy/often.  Work out your chest with different exercises. Triceps will be key too to a stronger bench max.  However, don't get caught up in numbers and how much you can lift.

Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas.

(so ur starting on ur 2nd set.)<br>  <br>  etc.. for the first day and try to increase about 1 rep every time.. then when u about doubled the amount of reps.. increase the sets<br>  <br>  for ex. after a while u will do<br>  1set of 20<br>  2nd set of 20<br>  <br>  then u will add a third set.. and lets say increase it to 5 more reps.. then increase this one till it gets to 20 then and then once u have 3 sets of 20 reps.. or 4 u add more weight.. to lets say to 10lbs..<br>  <br>  and so on<br>  the key is to keep increasing when ur body adapts.. like in time when it comes to aerobic, and increase reps and weights and sets..BUT AT YOUR OWN PACE..

What may be a small amount of bleeding could turn loose and be life-threatening, and you don't want to wait for that.    A Gastroenterologist (stomach-intestines specialist) is the doctor who would examine you, with an endoscopy - where he inserts a small tube with a camera on the end and checks out your innards on a TV screen.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes a doctor doesn't take you very serious, even though your words perfectly describe something he should pay attention to. <br>  <br>  The next time you have a BM, you could find a plastic tub or a lid, something to catch the stool before it reaches the water, to better describe how it looks, or take a sample, with blood, to the doctor's office  (Taped shut).<br>  <br>  It is important know you don't have something serious going on.   <br>  Good luck with it!
15Bv8jGfaa	If you feel like you have a bag of air in your stomach your problem may not be exercise related, but dietary. You cannot target specific areas of the body to lose fat- cardio will help to make you lose fat, and weight training will help you to tone specific areas, but exercise only counts about 30% - losing weight is 70% diet related.  <br>  If your belly is sticking out, however, and you have a gas problem or feel bloated, it is most like WHAT you are eating that is a problem.  Things like fruits and veggies with pips and skins (like tomatoes) or acidic foods (oranges, etc) can irritate your stomach and cause bloating - and it will make your stomach look like it is sticking out. I have a similar problem, and the key is to eat a high roughage but low fiber diet.

0TT5q0cUaa	try modifying your food instead:<br>  Proteins of animal origin are the best sources for high quality protein. Foods of plant origin tend to have a lower biological value and therefore different sources must be combined to gain a complete protein source. For e.g.- pulses and rice, idli, rajmah chawal etc. When choosing protein-rich foods, pay attention to what comes along with the protein. Vegetable sources of protein, such as beans, nuts, and whole grains, are excellent choices, and they offer healthy fibre, vitamins and minerals. The best animal protein choices are fish and poultry. If you are partial to red meat, stick with the leanest cuts, choose moderate portion sizes, and make it only an occasional part of your diet.<br>  <br>  A healthy balanced diet – which includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, is rich in whole grain cereal foods (wheat, jowar )and contains moderate amounts of dairy products, and moderate amounts of protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs and lentils – will provide all the nutrients that most people need. Vitamin and mineral supplements are no substitute for good eating habits.<br>  <br>  Fruit and vegetables are rich in a range of nutrients, including fiber and antioxidants such as vitamins C, E and A (in the form of carotenes). Many of these nutrients are also available in the form of dietary supplements. These nutrients do not work in isolation. Rather, its a mixture of different foods that seem to be the most effective. So, taking supplements wont necessarily have the same benefits as eating the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.<br>  <br>  With the wide variety of supplements on the market, its possible for people to exceed their daily requirements quite substantially. For some vitamins and minerals this isn't a problem because the body can easily get rid of the excess. However, it can be harmful to take too much of the vitamins and minerals that the body stores, such as vitamin A or iron.|`|wwRbkCMraa	these guys sell the best price best quality any where <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a>

The GM Diet* - An e-mail received from Shri M Siddique (who recd from Ravindra Jaju)<br>  Have you heard of the Physics Diet? As common sense goes, prevention is always better than cure!<br>  The following diet and health program was apparently developed for the employees and the dependants of General Motors Inc.<br>  The program was developed in conjunction with the grant from the US Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. It was first tried at the Johns Hopkins Research Centre and was approved for distribution by the Board of Directors of General Motors Corporation at a general meeting on August 15, 1995 .<br>  General Motors Corporation wholly endorsed this program and is making it available to all employees and families. This program will be available at all General Motors Food service facilities.<br>  It is the management’s intention to facilitate a welfare and fitness program for everyone.<br>  This program is designed for a target weight loss of 5-6 Kgs. per week. It will also improve your attitude and emotions because of its systematic cleansing effects. The effectiveness of this seven day plan is that the foods eaten burn more calories than they give to the body in caloric value. This plan can be used as often as you like to without any fear of complications. It is designed to flush your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well being. After seven days you will begin to feel lighter by atleast 10 pounds. You will have an abundance of energy and an improved disposition.<br>  During the first seven days you must drink 10 glasses of water each day.<br>  DAY ONE<br>  All fruits except bananas. Your first day will consists of all fruits you want. It is suggested you consume lots of watermelon and cantaloupe.<br>  DAY TWO<br>  All vegetables. You are encouraged to eat until you are stuffed with all the new and cooked vegetables of your choice. There is no limit on the account or type. Avoid oil and coconut while cooking vegetables. Have large boiled potato for breakfast.<br>  DAY THREE<br>  Any mixture of fruits and vegetables of your choice. Any amount, any quantity. No bananas yet and no potatoes today.<br>  DAY FOUR<br>  Bananas and milk. Today you will eat as many as eight bananas and drink three glasses of milk. You can also have one bowl of vegetables soup.<br>  DAY FIVE<br>  Today is a feast day. You will eat 1 (one) cup of rice. You also have to eat 6 (six) whole tomatoes and drink 12 (twelve) glasses of water today to cleanse your system of the excess uric acid you will be producing.<br>  DAY SIX<br>  Today is another all vegetables day. You must eat 1 cup of rice today and eat all the vegetables you want cooked and uncooked to your heart's content.<br>  DAY SEVEN<br>  Today your food intake will consist of 1 cup rice, fruit juice and all the vegetables you care to consume. Tomorrow morning you will be five to eight kilograms lighter than 1 week ago. If you desire further weight loss, repeat the program again. Repeat the program as often as you like, however, it is suggested that you rest for three days before every repetition.<br>  You have your system under control now and it will thank you for all the purging and cleansing you just gave it. Even more than a diet program it is good to follow this diet once in a while to clean your digestive system and remove toxic substances that have a accumulated in the system.<br>  ADDITIONAL COMMENTS<br>  The most important element of the program is the 10 (ten) tall glasses of water a day. You can also flavour the water will some lemon to make the drink easier. While on the program, take only black coffee and never more than one teaspoon of oil. Preferably do not use oil because the high calorific content. No fruit juices before day seven.<br>  Here is what happens to you body while you are on this program and how and why it works.<br>  Day 1: You are preparing your system for the upcoming program. Your only source of nutrition is fresh fruits. Fruits are nature's perfect food. They provide everything you can possibly want to sustain life except total balance and variety.<br>  Day 2: Starts with a fix complex carbohydrates in the form of a boiled potato. This is taken in the form of a boiled potato and taken in the morning to provide energy and balance. The rest of the day too consists of vegetables which are virtually calories free and provide essential nutrients and fibre.<br>  Day 3: Eliminates the potato because you get your carbohydrates from fruits. Your system is now prepared to start burning excess pounds. You will have cravings, which should start to diminish by day four.<br>  Day 4: Bananas and milk. You are in for a surprise. You probably will not be able to eat all the bananas allowed. But they are there for the potassium you have lost and the sodium you may have missed during the last three days. You will notice a definite loss of desire for sweets and you will be surprised at how easy this day will go.<br>  Day 5: Rice and tomatoes. The rice is for the carbohydrates and the tomatoes are for the digestion and the fibre. Drinking a lot of water purifies your system. You should notice colourless urine today. If you do not feel like having one cup rice, you may eat less. But you may eat six tomatoes.<br>  Day 6: It is similar to day five. Vitamins and fibre from the vegetables and carbohydrates from the rice. By now your system is in a total weight loss inclination. There should be a noticeable difference in the way you look today compared to day one.<br>  Day 7: You may celebrate with champagne. You may also have white wine instead of champagne, but in all practical programs, and in all surveys done to measure the success of the program, General Motors employees have always preferred champagne to white wine.<br>  More than one cup of coffee with milk is especially forbidden. Milk and oil add empty calories to your diet. Avid coffee lovers can console themselves with black coffee. However, after the first week, it will help your digestion and set your stomach. The key thing to remember is that if you are hungry at any time, then you are not following the diet correctly. Almost all people give up the diet when they are hungry because of dieting. The secret of this program is that you should never hungry. If it is a vegetable day, eat so much vegetables that you are never hungry. If it is a fruits day, eat so much fruits that you are never hungry. You may be bored of eating vegetables all day, but you should not be hungry. You can take any amount of General Motors wonder soup on any day.<br>  GENERAL MOTORS WONDER SOUP<br>  The following soup is intended as a supplement to your diet. It can be eaten any time of the day in virtually unlimited quantities. You are encouraged to drink large quantities of this soup.<br>  · 23 oz water<br>  · 06 large onions<br>  · 02 green peppers<br>  · 03 whole tomatoes<br>  · 1 cabbage<br>  · 1 bunch celery - add herbs and seasoning as desired.<br>  This program is highly recommended for women and men above 40 for whom excess weight is especially dangerous. Excess weight for women aggravates arthritis problems and leads to rapid joint decay. Pain and joint deterioration can be lessened by weight loss as weight loss removes the stress on the knee joint. Excess weight is the most critical factor in keeping good health and excess weight is responsible for the most problems including coronary diseases, heart problems, arthritis and cancer among other serious life threatening diseases. Most serious health problems can be avoided by the single function of maintaining an ideal weight. Daily mild exercise of 20 minutes is also essential. Do not tire yourself out, but being regular in your exercise and maintaining an ideal weight goes a long way in ensuring a happy, healthy and long life.<br>  <br>  Wish you the very best in your endeavour!<br>  <br>  -mohit|`|POFdWpUzaa	First of all, consult with your physician before trying any over-the-counter pills of any kind...especially if you are taking any prescribed medications.

Therefore, cut your calories, eat lots of fruits and veggies and grains and lean protein. Half of your plate should be veggies, 1/4 of your plate lean protein, and 1/4 of your plate starch. Have fruits for dessert. But be sure to reseach portion sizes, eg, 1 small apple is one fruit serving, 1/2 banana is a serving, 1 cup raw veggies is a serving, 1/2 cup cooked veggies is a serving, 2 ounces of cooked protein is a serving.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight.

Okay you are forgiven. Well, nobody can blame you if you really wanted to fit in the gown you will wear for your friend's wedding. Or let us say, you just skipped lunch or ate crackers all week to loose those stubborn pounds. And maybe worse, you bragged to your friends how effective those so called "emergency diets" were. You were perfect wearing the gown and the scale said you lost four pounds in just one week. Wow! Isn't it too good to be true?<br>  <br>  But the real truth is, you didn't loose weight and will never loose weight through starving. What you lost was the excess water or fluids in your body, the moment you go back to your old routine your weight will follow through. This article will show you that you can eat and still loose weight. Actually, there are only two ways to loose weight- don't starve and eat right.<br>  <br>  First, as I have discussed earlier never, never starve yourself. Not only will your weight bounce back when you return to your old routine, you can get into trouble too. Skipping meals or not eating at all may lead you to ulcer, gastritis, nausea and many other medical illnesses. Furthermore, eating foods like crackers may have prevented your body to get the right amount of nutrients. Without proper nutrition, your body cannot work well and you may even get sick in the long run.<br>  <br>  Second, eat and still loose weight. Wait, it doesn't mean you can grab the chips or everything in your pantry. What I am trying to tell here is that you have to eat healthy foods for loosing weight. Dieticians recommend that in order to loose weight you have to eat the right healthy food in right proportions. What are the right foods that you should eat and still loose weight? What are the foods to be avoided?<br>  <br>  For starters, you should have the correct proportions of vegetables, fruits, carbohydrates and protein. Nutritionists recommend eating three to five servings of vegetables a day. For snacks, instead of eating a bag of Lays, opt for an apple, nuts or dried fruits. You can get carbohydrates from bread and rice. Substitute your traditional white bread to wheat bread and choose a non-fat butter or spread.<br>  <br>  For you protein, beans are good substitute for meat just like tofu. Eat only the lean meat of pork and beef. Red meat is a good source of iron so you should eat once in a while. Chicken breast is also a good source of protein for someone who wants to eat and still loose weight. However, throw the chicken's skin since it is a good source of bad cholesterol.<br>  <br>  Another strategy of weight loss by eating is through right proportions. Even if you eat chicken breasts but you eat 6 servings of it, your weight loss by eating is still useless. Utilize the internet for the suggested serving size and proportion for every food you put in your mouth. For starters, just be conscious of eating the right amount. You know for a fact that 1 cup of rice is enough for every meal.<br>  <br>  Eating healthy foods for loosing weight doesn't mean you cannot give in to your favorite high-calorie snacks. Experts suggest that you can reward yourself for loosing weight by having a low-fat ice cream once a month. Just remember, the secret to eat and still loose weight diet is discipline. Weight loss by eating will never be effective if you give in to temptations. Take smaller steps one at a time and discipline yourself. Soon, you will never realize that you are enjoying your favorite food yet you are loosing weight.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://online--weight--loss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://online--weight--loss.blogspot.com...</a>|`|85KrSJh3aa	What you need is a proven system that is natural and permanent.

7oZv1hWFaa	what i usually do to fall asleep is i get nice and comfey in my bed so that is it toasty warm inside. <br>  i usually turn on the tv but put the sound on to like 8(low volume is good). <br>  and i usually turn to like a kids channel like disney channel.<br>  i like to just listen to the tv and dont think of anything else that is going on. <br>  its basically my zen state when my mind is just clear. <br>  keep your eyes closed even though the tv is on. <br>  i will either get really bored and fall asleep or i just never noticed when i went to sleep when i closed my eyes. <br>  <br>  yeah i know this is lame but i really am afraid of the dark. <br>  so usually i just hide under my blanket and create basically  my own place of security under my blanket. <br>  my fear of the dark outside makes me close my eyes super tightly so i dont see it even if im under the blanket.<br>  <br>  if that doesnt work then lie in bed and try to read a book for a while. <br>  your eyes will get tired from reading and they will eventually fall to sleep. <br>  <br>  if none of this works than try to remember things that make your eyes tired really easily or keep your eyes shut super tight while waiting to go to sleep with a clear mind.<br>  <br>  i know for me that when i play sports i come home tired and after all of my homework and chores i am exhausted and when i lie down and just close my eyes shut i have the nicest deep sleep. (make suree its not a sport your body cannot take to where you get a lot of lactic acid build up since it gives you a choppy nights rest)|`|dqc3SNCTaa	I personally get up and go to the family room and sip on a small glass of warm milk and watch tv for about 30 minutes. then i go back to <br>  my bed and just relax. and eventually youll be out!<br>  <br>  :)|`|63y7bTNMaa	when trying to sleep its best to "meddle in something mundane" in other words, do something boring, this helps me, i quickly tire of the activity and get drowsy, and next thing i know i'm waking up refreshed, also regularity is a must, establish a routine, same bedtime each day and same rousing time, this will help your body to tire at the appropriate times, if you are waking up every morning (even on weekends and days with no school) on time instead of at strange times (noon, evening, middle of the night) then you're probably ok, if you need things to help you sleep, try these: warm milk, relaxing music,darker sleeping area, and other traditional things that may help....hope i helped a little bit, good luck
F3KkB4GWaa	I had stitches on my toe once I never got them taken out by a doctor I just snipped them with some scissors and pulled them out. Didnt hurt a bit.|`|Z81bOxq7aa	The ER should have told you what they wanted you to do. Call your Doctor as He/She should have received a report from the hospital with the details of your injury & the appropriate repairs. They will know if you have dissoluble stitches or not. You would probably go to you Doctor as this is a very simple procedure that can be done at the office. You need to call right away though so that you can get an appointment at the appropriate time as they should not be left in too long if they are not dissoluble. They can get infected & if left in too long they hurt to be removed. When done at the correct time usually about 4-5 days they are not painful to remove & usually slide right out. <br>  JTM&AB|`|AA11693263	You just need to make an appointment with you family doctor. Be sure to tell them what it is for because you probably won't even need to see the doctor for this. One of his nurses will most likely be the one to remove them. It's best to have it done there instead of doing it yourself. When I had mine taken out there was about 3 inches that were not healed together all the way and they had to apply adhesive strips to it to let it completely heal. I understand that you only have 4 stitches compared to the 27 that I had but even with only 4 there is a chance that this can happen. Not to mention the tools that the doctors office will use are sterile and anything you use at home isn't and you risk infection. It will just be safer and easier if you go to your doctor to have them removed.|`|RDrjBLGjaa	It depends on hoe serious your stiches are.

These things happen to people every day.  Actually, some people in under-developed countries never have homes at all!<br>  <br>  Secondly, when you say "I won't be able to find a job," what you really mean is "I won't be able to find a job that I want."  For goodness sake, be a fry cook at McDonald's!  Be a bus boy!  Work at Starbucks!  There is SOME job out there for you, especially if you went to college, and (if you can swallow your pride) this job will hold you over until something better comes along.<br>  <br>  Third, if your parents are willing to help you, then reach out to them.  Embrace the fact that two people love you so much.  You may even ask to move back in with them in order to save money.  This is not admitting failure; it is being responsible and humble enough to recognize when you need help.<br>  <br>  Fourth, if one psychiatrist didn't work, try another.  Heck, try three, four, fifty others until you find someone who is right for you, who you feel comfortable talking to.<br>  <br>  Fifth, go out and meet people!  The fact that you have such a negative view of yourself is probably putting up an invisible wall to those who could be potential friends.  After doing some soul searching, pick up a hobby that would introduce you to new people.  Join a gym, a wine tasting club, etc.<br>  <br>  Essentially, you have an entire life ahead of you.  You'll probably live another 50-60 years!  Imagine the possibilities!

I need money if I wanna get some where, I need a job, or a license, and pass school. I'm completely suicidal I told my friend I was about to kill myself and he said "lol I'm writing a song" I was like wtf? So I need help too. You just need to understand life is going to get better no matter how many people are not going to help you through it. I've learned, let God help you with some of it. REALLY REALLY pray. Go to a community church and find some friends for life. I know I might not know you but I'm going to pray for you tonight and all the other people with depression because I believe God is going to help us and we are going to live.

For me I felt like I was falling through quick sand, no one to help me out and no one to hear me scream and I kept sinking. Nothing could motivate me, even though I felt like i was motivated i lost it in a short while, nothing worked. No one could help me, I lost my social life and academics, I was like the "smart kid" in school I had straight a's but i wasn't a nerd I had really good friends, but I had issues that killed me and my grades dropped. I just never could go to sleep because I was constantly stressed anxious nervous, scared and confused my head was out of whack my emotions felt like they were running wild and this happened for 3 years. I wanted to get into some prestigious universites (stanford, berkeley, ucla) it was my dream but I let myself and everyone who loved me down plus I killed my dream and I felt I had nothing no longer to live for. But for some reason I always kept hope. Felt I could start over, maybe this is a test from god, maybe if I get through this, this will make me a better person so i can learn from this and persevere later. I always lost it too though. I wanted to hope things would get better but they never did not for 3 years. But i never gave up, when i lost hope I told myself I have nobody to tell me what to do except myself, only I have myself and I have to believe in myself that things will get better and i'll get through to things and everything will be better. Just don't give up, I know it's going to be hell but don't do it, we've been though the great depression but things did get better in the u.s., the economy will be good again. I think the best thing you can do is try to be social, have friends to distract you from your problems. I know it's hard though because your not yourself, i wasn't. Just don't give up hope, suicide is not the way. I don't think god will help us, I think god put us in this mess. But I think he has a purpose, what it is I'm not quite sure yet, because I think I just got out of it and I have my life ahead of me and I'll see and find out. But I don't blame God he does everything for I reason, even though I was going through what I was, I always was thankful for not being worse than I was.|`|ZT1wBK69aa	If you need someone to talk to, I would be more than willing to listen.<br>  You are 26, which sounds like a great age (I am 21 now).<br>  <br>  I hate that you may lose your job, however, there is always the support of unemployment until you land another great job!<br>  <br>  Have you looked into teaching, if you have your BA/BS?<br>  <br>  I hate that you worry too much, I am quite pessimistic myself, but not to a certain extreme. <br>  Life is a big *****, but there are always things that will happen to turn your life around completely.

0TT5q0cUaa	If indulged in moderation, masturbation, on the contrary, is a healthy practice that releases sexual energy. According to certain religious practices and beliefs, masturbation is harmful since it results in the loss of a man's "seeds" and makes him weak. Masturbation in women has largely been ignored in the religious texts. Other myths surrounding the act are that it reduces virility by making the semen less thick thereby reducing the chances of a man to bear children. This is totally untrue. Masturbation does not cause any loss of strength or virility in a person.<br>  <br>  One can stop masturbating if one wants to. Just as one can live without indulging in sex, one can also stop masturbating with some will power. However, since the activity has nothing to be ashamed of and most people do it, there is no scientific reason to discontinue it. If one still wishes to discontinue, then the sexual energy may need to be channelised into alternative physical activities.|`|6fb7392757c2cda50b13cf240bc7aed7aa	If you are serious about wanting to control that behavior and what motivates it, you need to become very self aware and honest with yourself ,and once you have defined your behavior that sets you up for masturbation, you can come up with a plan on how to consciously stop it, and enjoy being in ,and exerting self control over your bodily urges. I admire you for desiring to get knowledge on how to stop.First write in a diary the pros of self mastery over sexual urges and indulging in self abuse.What are the positives you might achieve in your life by controlling and understanding your sexual drives?Is there a supportive group or affiliation of males that are like minded and not derogatory towards someone as yourself that wishes to overcome this unhealthy habit?Heavenly Father counsels us that do what ever it takes to get a reign over your sexual urges and sexual gratification is meant for the marriage bed ? So working towards eliminating this affliction would seem to be 1). Knowing what behaviors or activities make you more vulnerable in indulging in this act? Learn what they are and develop a plan for overcoming the temptations when you are at your weakest have a contingency plan.2) Try and be around supportive people  that won't belittle your efforts at self control.Let's face it most of society goes by what ever feels good indulge in as long as it is consensual and no one gets hurt. Which is asinine. Guy who habitually self abuse generally heterosexually speaking. are not that good in bed,find that the porn they may indulge in usually is not compatible with the female in a romantic or marriage type relationship. Women are offended when they know that the man they are in a sexual relationship with and in love with secretly( and of course it is always done in secret isn't it)? Indulges in pornographic fantasies or literature and images generally of strangers not themselves and engages in masturbation . It leaves the woman in the relationship not trusting second guessing her desirability and attractiveness why is her mate orgasaming to the idea of another and not of me with me or at least 'us'participating  together? Not Solo and certainly not being aroused by some one other than herself as in the case of the hyper sexualized female fantasy portrayed in Mens Porn mags a completely stranger giving him giving her of his  orgasm that should only belong to me? How could this be good in anyway shape or form in human sexual relationships and familial bonding.? Sex by design is not intended to be  acted upon solo or alone. Any other use of it is pathologic in one degree or another. It has the potential to leave a life in ruin by obstructing the natural bonding that takes place when sex is left exclusive for the couple not as one but together|`|VIM4XmYNaa	Try to think of something that makes you WANT to stop masturbating.

B12 shots are offered at the dr.'s office and that gives you energy and also drinking lots of water and getting enough sleep has a lot to do with it. also getting enough physical exercise during the day helps with keeping things in balance.<br>  I usually get this way around the time I will have my period.

xYTagSIyaa	You should try running cool water over your eye for at least 15 minutes or until the burning is stopped.  Things can be absorbed through the eye and isopropyl is poisonous, so it should be washed out.  Alcohol has a different ph to the eye and can burn it, so it needs to be rinsed off.  The sooner you do this the less likely there will be any damage.<br>  <br>  Normal saline is unnecessary, nor does washing it have to be sterile use tap water if it is drinkable it will be fine and run it over the eye.  If you still feel burning rinse it again, and again.  If after you have done this and you still feel burning or pain, then you should go to the emergency.<br>  <br>  A small speck of alcohol in the eye that has been rinsed out quickly, and if you have no more burning or pain, you will more than likely be fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  What you need to do depends on how much actually got in the eye.  Sometimes the fumes from the alcohol can sting the eye and make you think you have gotten some in the eye and nothing went in, in this case you are fine.<br>  <br>  Rubbing Alcohol is too strong for your face and can result in severe drying and lead to wrinkles.  I would suggest in the future a gentle cream cleanser.|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	no, you're OK|`|lsv1edQVaa	You're going to be fine.

For you it's hitting people, so get away from people.  For me, I was rather scared of myself, so I would go far away from what would cause me to do what I feared.<br>  <br>  You know hurting people isn't good right?  Of course you do, you sound very intelligent.  And you should probably stop not because your wrist is sprained but because you know it's wrong.  People don't deserve that.  <br>  <br>  Anyhow, do something you like.  Write a list of things you would do in the situation so that there is no question.  I would go outside and swing, or play the piano.  Whatever gets my mind off of it, and calms me down.  I heard even breathing deep for awhile helps.  Count to ten?  Those are all elementary, but they work.  Maybe take up Yoga?  But yeah, take a nap or even just drink a glass of water and close your eyes.|`|a7mmLbiRaa	Venting anger isn't really the ideal solution.  The best way to solve anger problems is to work on trying not to get so mad in the first place.  But you have to mean it, you have to seriously try.  It comes from first realizing when you are pissed off and admitting that it isn't helping anything.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you are a 14 year old girl, there probably will be plenty of people willing to let you hit them.  However, what you need to do is stop getting so angry altogether.  I'm 23, and I don't think I've really been angry at anything in 5 years or more.<br>  <br>  Karate is what did it for me.

Do things that would tire you out so you are too tired to feel angry like throwing something as hard as you can or in the moment just take deep breathes and count to ten. Really punching someone or even screaming like I said earlier in front of people just looks like your throwing a temper tantrum and people will treat you like you are an immature child which I am sure you do not want to be seen as so if someone makes you really angry just go someplace nobody is like the bathroom to calm down so you do not end up looking silly.

Ovulation occurs around fourteen or fifteen days from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle.

a98MpjZ9aa	According to modern psychoanalysis there are multiple and mutually reinforcing determinants.  The main one is this:<br>  <br>  First, there is ambivalence towards the mother.  Infantile anger makes a child wish to reject the breast, but this rejection also has a side benefit for an older girl: If she doesn't eat she will get thin, and thinness has a particular appeal to most girls.  The reason is this:<br>  <br>  Small children have a theory that there is no essential difference between boys and girls.  It's just that girls have been castrated, presumably because they did something bad; but if they are really sweet and all sugar and spice and everything nice their penises will grow back, and they will be boys again someday.  They will grow up and marry mommie.  <br>  <br>  There is a certain amount of logic behind this.  In fact, before puberty there is no really noticeable difference between boys and girls.  They both have smooth hairless skin, they both are about the same height, they both are slender.<br>  <br>  At menarche, though, a girl knows it's over.  Her hips widen, breasts appear, body fat increases, etc.  However, she still has an out.  She can starve herself or get involved with strenuous exercise (like gymnastics) and she will actually regress.  Her weight will decrease, her breasts will get smaller and her menstrual cycles will stop--or so she believes, because that actually happens in some cases.   <br>  <br>  At any rate, no anorexics or bulimics are actually conscious of these feelings and infantile theories, because they are repressed from infancy.  Some of these repressed theories are nearly universal, in fact.  The reason we can't remember anything that happened before we were five years old is that we have repressed memories of a time of great anxiety.  Most anything that happens to an infant causes anxiety because infants are so helpless.  That's why we can't remember things from that age, but they are the memories that make us do crazy things like get bulimia or anorexia nervosa.|`|tDPuXEa0aa	I think of it as bad.<br>  Overeating isn't even frowned upon as much as anerexia or belemia in my opinion.

But the other two are just like "hurting yourself".|`|8j7FCEOraa	I think: Wow, these people having eating disorders.|`|UEAdAuqbaa	Anorexia is a serious mental problem. People looks at themselves and instead of seeing the bony skeleton everyone else sees, they see a cow.<br>  <br>  Bulimia is just as serious, if not a tad bit more. Not only is making yourself throw up disgusting, it is also a major hazard to your body. All that bile going up and down your esophagus wears out the lining and can lead to lifelong damage. Along with that, bulimia can cause ulcers.<br>  <br>  Both are ridiculous.|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	I guess I just wonder what causes people to get out of control with that stuff. I've always been a fatass compared with my brothers and sisters, and my parents, especially my father, loved to rag on me for it all the time (in fact, he still does whenever he gets the chance). I went through periods where I would try not to eat for as long as possible, but the feeling of being weak and starved always forced me to eat finally. I have no idea how anyone can stand to just not eat for ages! And the making yourself barf thing is even worse. I HATE throwing up. Even if it's my own fault, like I drank too much, I still try to fight it as much as possible. So I cannot fathom willingly forcing myself to barf! <br>  <br>  I also worry about my daughter, who seems to have inherited my -er- big boned-ness, or whatever it is that makes me chunky, because my wife is like a twig and mentions her weight a LOT. I hope she doesn't decide to stop eating altogether.|`|Q8etYn60aa	It makes me sad.  I don't respect people with eating disorders any less than any other person, I just really feel for them.  It's not pity or anything, it just makes me wish I could help them.  I've been through depression and suicide attempts personally and I think that this type of thing has a lot in common with eating disorders.  It's a terrible place to be, to dislike yourself so much, and my heart just aches for them.|`|WZVz5jWHaa	Very, very sad to be so desperate about looks and life in general.|`|jewz4KVtaa	I think they need to see a counsellor as they have deep issues with themselves.

Its the beginning of carpal tunnel in your wrist. You need a good two weeks of rest atleast and then you gotta take it slow.|`|ei0Wryytaa	did the bone just crack like when your cracking your knuckles??|`|bQ4RAi07aa	When you grip, grasp, clench, pinch or wring anything in your hand, you use two major tendons in your wrist and lower thumb. These tendons run side by side from your forearm through the thumb side of your wrist. They normally glide unhampered through the small tunnel that connects them to the base of the thumb. In de Quervain's tenosynovitis, the tendons' slippery covering becomes inflamed, restricting movement of the tendons. <br>  <br>  A common cause is chronic overuse of your wrist. For example, peeling carrots involves a repetitive motion, a bent wrist and the gripping of the peeler. If you peel carrots or potatoes day after day, hour after hour, this combination may be enough to irritate the sheath around the two tendons. <br>  <br>  Other causes of de Quervain's tenosynovitis include: <br>  <br>  Direct injury to your wrist or tendon; scar tissue can restrict movement of the tendons <br>  Inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis <br>  Treatment includes immobilizing  the wrist for a few days or using a splint on the wrist, anti-inflammatory meds (ibuprofen) or shots in the wrist if it continues check with your dr.  Hope this helps.|`|tX2PIgiXaa	This has happened to me only a few times. It might be that your playing to long or that you cant have your fingers stretched out and be comfortable.

Honey is great, but not worth the long term effects of high glucose levels.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Type 1 diabetics take insulin... so with the proper dosage of insuline, yes she could eat a small amount of honey.  However, honey goes into the bloodstream much much faster than any other type of sugar, almost in an instant.  So if she has a low blood sugar, great.  But if her sugar is running high.. big problem.

Both honey and sugar will affect your blood sugar level.<br>  <br>  Honey is sweeter than granulated sugar, so you might use a smaller amount of honey for sugar in some recipes. But honey actually has slightly more carbohydrates and more calories per teaspoon than does granulated sugar — so any calories and carbohydrates you save will be nominal.<br>  <br>  If you prefer the taste of honey, go ahead and use it — but only in moderation. Be sure to count the carbohydrates in honey as part of your diabetes eating plan.|`|AA12188268	She can eat anything she wants as long as it is within the limits of her diet.

0cuMP6bSaa	The higher the number, the thicker the glasses.  The + sign will magnify the eye whereas a - would make the eyes appear smaller.  If you're getting a cheap pair off the internet, then you should only need a number for the sphere and nothing for the cylinder, axis or add. <br>  <br>  If you do order the +13, I can almost guarantee you will get a headache and/or feel dizzy after a short amount of time wearing them.  They will also strain your eyes, so my advice is to get just frames with no prescription in the lenses (they won't be thick, but you'll be able to wear them all night), or just get the glasses, but don't wear them the entire time.
AUOp1j5Saa	Yes, these are some typical symptoms of pregnancy; however, this does not necessarily mean you are pregnant.<br>  Taking some HPTs should help to clear this issue up.<br>  If you were having sex without protection for the month you were not on birth control then I would say your chances of pregnancy are very high.<br>  <br>  Also, sore lower back and a hard belly actually are common early symptoms of pregnancy along with everything else you mentioned.<br>  <br>  Morning sickness is experienced by many but not all women and many do not begin to feel nauseated until 6-8 weeks if they do at all.|`|8XURx7nzaa	have you had morning sickness? sounds like you are you should get a test just in case to make sure.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	It's okay for a period to be late.

AA11101385	You need to follow this regime:<br>  <br>  1) Eat healthy. 6 small meals, not 3 big ones. Cut out HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup), fast food, fattening food, and junk food. Eat more protein and fiber. Eat more fruit and veggies. Also, drink plenty of water (about 8 glasses per day).<br>  <br>  2) Cardio exercise 2-3 times per week. Exercises include running, swimming, biking, etc. This helps to increase your metabolism and burns fat. This is the best way to get rid of fat on your body.<br>  <br>  3) Weight lift. Although this sounds contradictory, weight lifting helps to increase metabolism and reduce fat.<br>  <br>  4) Focus on being healthy 24/7.<br>  <br>  5) I forgot to add this. The most important thing once you've done the previous 4 is to do crunches to actually work on your abs. Everybody has abs; however, once you do a lot of exercising (both cardio and weight lifting) and healthly eating, you lower your body fat percentage, which will allow your abs to be more visible. Then you need to tone your abs with crunches. Do regular crunches, inclined crunches, and medicine ball crunches for your upper abs. Do right and left crunches, right and left iso crunches, and bicycle crunches for your obliques (your side and middle abs). And do reverse crunches, knee ups, and leg lifts for your lowers abs, which are the hardest. I do about 200 crunches per day, in about 5 sets of 40 crunches, but this is becuase I'm advanced. Depending on your level, I would recommend doing 2-3 sets of 10-20 reps of each type of crunch.|`|iAv9P3HTaa	A "quick" way to get abs is in the combination of diet and exercises.<br>  It depends on body fat with males it starts showing under 10%.<br>  These exercises much more effective then push ups or sit ups:<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Crunch<br>  Lie with the ball resting under the mid/lower back and place hands behind the head or across the chest. Contract your abs to lift your the torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips. As you curl up, keep the ball stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crunch & Reach<br>  Begin with body straight over the ball, light weight extended behind you (not shown). Contract the abs to lift and bring the weight over the head, crunching up and twisting to the right, contracting the right side of waist. Repeat for all reps and then switch sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Modified Plank<br>  Begin by placing elbows on the floor and resting body on the knees. Pull the abs tight to hold your body in a straight line from head to knees without sagging in the middle, eyes looking naturally forward. Hold this position for as long as you can, relax and repeat 3 or more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Knee Tucks<br>  Start in plank position on the ball, with the ball under the shins/ankles. Roll the ball towards you with your feet, tightening the abs into a crunch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Woodchops<br>  Attach one end of a resistance band to something sturdy and wrap the band around your hand a few times for the right tension. Grasp the band in both hands and begin in a lunge position, reaching down with the arms Keeping the arms straight the entire time, rotate and lift the body towards the other side while sweeping the arms on a diagonal. Return to start and repeat before moving onto the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hip Extension on the Ball<br>  Lie on the floor with feet heels propped on ball. Keeping abs tight, slowly lift your hips off the floor (squeezing the buttocks) until body is in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds and lower<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Taps<br>  Sit on the ball with strong abs and straight spine, hands behind the head. Contract your abs and lift the right foot, tapping it on a medicine ball in front of you. Lower and repeat with the other foot, alternating sides. Use your abs to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  How to Work Your Abs<br>  <br>  * You can effectively work your abs with 3 non-consecutive workouts a week<br>  * Do 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps of each exercise. If that's too easy, make sure you're doing each exercise correctly and using perfect form. You can add a dumbbell or plate to crunches to add difficulty.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|GYdbXHpTaa	Dude, eating cheetos every other day isn't going to make you gain weight.|`|PEh6Ofc4aa	Try the 16-week workout referenced on the source site below.  It is essentially a superset fat burning and muscle building workout all in one that you do 3 times a week.  To accelerate the process, you can implement interval training on your off days the other 3 days of the week as described on the site.  Dieting at the same time will help as well.  This workout will really boost your metabolism and get you on the way to 6-pack abs.|`|Yjlqmt0vaa	goto the store and buy some|`|z9nCUpaOaa	Check out the free workout videos at ..<a href="http://www.FatX101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.FatX101.com</a>|`|sobrGyNYaa	The only way a six pack will show is if you're slim enough for the muscles to be seen. That means that being overweight or having fat around your midsection will hide it. Yeah, building up the abdominal muscles is necessary as well, but you have to get rid of the fat simultaneously. <br>  <br>  You need to be exercising every day - run 3 days a week and life weights another 3 days a week. Running just on the weekends isn't consistent enough to help you lose a lot of fat. <br>  <br>  Also - you don't have to diet. Why? Because diets don't work. Just eat healthier. Cut out the junk food and the sodas. Don't eat dessert after every meal. Have a healthy bowl of cereal for breakfast, drink orange juice, cut out red meat and fried foods if you can, limit yourself to drinking water/tea/sports drinks/juice - but watch the sugar intake. One other thing - stop eating before you get completely full. Eat enough to tide you over, but don't overdo it. <br>  <br>  The rest is just discipline on your part to stick to a healthier lifestyle. If you start now and stay consistent with your exercise and healthy eating, then you'll see a significant change by the summer. The fact that you used to be skinny means that you should be able to get back to that point again and stay there without a huge amount of trouble.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|L4GkJvHKaa	You want a six pack just by running? That won't work.<br>  Running will help get rid of fat but that's not all you need to do.<br>  <br>  If you do intend to run every Saturday and Sunday morning do so. <br>  After that do some crunches. Left elbow to right knee, right elbow to left knee, repeating. Do at least 3 sets of 12-15. <br>  <br>  If you would like some more workouts, try google or youtube.|`|a7dlJgMiaa	next time you see a bowflex commercial<br>  write that number down.
WihHz9Elaa	Your wisdom teeth may have become impacted, which means there is literally not enough room in your jaw to accommodate them. This can cause several symptoms, most notably serious pain and discomfort. <br>  <br>  I would contact your dentist immediately about moving up your appointment for oral surgery. The pain will not go away until the wisdom teeth are removed. In the meantime, perhaps your dentist can prescribe a stronger pain medication.|`|Z9B7caBfaa	I had all my wisdom teeth and 1 rear moler removed about a week ago.<br>  Have been in agony ever since,just on one lower side. I regret having<br>  them taken out now,since I've developed "Dry Socket" and have been <br>  in 10 times more pain than before the surgery.If you dont get dry socket,<br>  you will feel better,but there is always that chance. I should have done<br>  much more research before having this,or any surgery. The impacted<br>  wisdom teeth have been impacted for probably 15 years,and now at<br>  36 years old,it may have not even been them,that were hurting. It's hard <br>  to sometimes tell,which teeth or tooth is hurting,if it's radiating down one <br>  side of your mouth. All this agonizing pain may have not even been necessary.Make sure you know your risks and advantages of having<br>  any type of surgery,regardless of how many doctors tell you to do it,since<br>  it's not them,that will be living with the pain,it's you.

4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Why would you not take your son to a Peditrician to have him checked out if he's showing cold symptoms for three months at a time?

People that are great pain want relief from the pain, having 20 people in the room that are in equally severe pain is no comfort to them at all.  Besides that, no one person experiences the exact same pain even when they are suffering from an absolutely identical injury.  Wanting to experience pain by suffering an injury or illness, would mean that you are so disconnected from your own feelings that you think intense pain may reconnect you, or that you feel that you deserve to suffer because you feel guilt that some else suffered  and you did not.  You would really benefit by talking to some one about your feelings

You should talk to your dentist and get an x-ray done to see if you have an adult tooth there at all, or if it just has not moved into place.  <br>  <br>  If your tooth is impacted, you'll probably have to get surgery where the surgeon places a small chain on the impacted tooth and attaches the chain to braces.  The chain will gradually pull your adult tooth into place, and it can take months.  This surgery costs about $3000, plus the cost of having braces put on, about $5000.<br>  <br>  If there is no adult tooth at this site, the dentist might leave your primary tooth in, or remove it and then place a dental implant in the empty space in your gums. This surgery costs about $6000.|`|7jXChfBNaa	you are too old to lose it now. it will just stay a primary tooth, this is pretty normal. i am a dental assistant of 5 years and see it quite often in even older adults. you probably don't have an adult tooth underneath that one. if you haven't already go to the dentist and have them take an x-ray to tell you if you have a tooth under that one. hope this helps you=]

Nothing (short of surgery) will change that.<br>  <br>  The only thing that gets bigger when using pills or pumps is the suppliers' bank accounts because deluded people throw away their hard-earned cash to unscrupulous companies.<br>  <br>  (See example below)|`|osY0xlhTaa	The most effective and safest way to get a bigger penis is with penis enlargement exercises. The idea is to gradually increase the capacity of the chambers in the penis to hold blood. The bigger the chambers are, the more blood they hold when you get an erection, and so the bigger the erect penis is.<br>  <br>  Pills don't work because all they do is increase the blood flow, not the amount the chambers can hold. At best all they'll do is give you harder erections.<br>  <br>  There's a good site with info on all the different methods and detailed exercises at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a> - check it out.|`|HrewRe7saa	Really, size is going to be determined at birth due to genetics.<br>  <br>  Pills and other things can only assist in reaching a full erection, but ultimately size is determined by nature.|`|vA2Eqh81aa	Drugs solve nothing. <br>  You cant change it without surgery<br>  Be happy with what you have.|`|0wHeVJ50aa	I personally don't care how big he is.

EkdjQBIuaa	well you can get sick by....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  no joke, <br>  <br>  <br>  focing self to eat something old<br>  <br>  hold a flashlight to head til its warm, then sticking ice around your lips so they turn bluish.<br>  <br>  also, just go to school but before your mom drops you off, insist that you feel horrible and like you want to throw up. then go to school and call in sick to the office. nurses are so stupid they just check your temp and then let you call parents. go right after lunch, so you will have the chance to buy like a burrito or something warm and let the heat go on your forehead and then eat it so your mouth is warm. then go home "sick" and have your mom or someone pick you up, and thell her that you threw up during class in the bathroom. say that you can play the piano because your hands are shaky and numbish and she will feel horrible. just do some good acting and dont over exxagerate the hand shakiness. just a little will do. :)|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Sorry, Bubba!

Well, if he wants symptoms, syrup of ipecac will make him throw up.  Or, he could take some stool softeners and have the runs for a day.<br>  <br>  Really though, sometimes the truth is better than fiction.  How about telling the teacher what happened?  It's an honest mistake, to overwrite your work.  Anyone could have done such a thing.  Have you tried to find a copy of your work that your computer automatically backed up?  It may still be on your computer.  Good luck.

Good Luck!|`|jhjFp09zaa	tell him to stay up all night, and to constintally go to the bathroom all night and be loud about it, and flush the toilet and **** and when he gets woken up he should be like i dont feel good i was up all night puking and stuff i think i caught a flu or something can i have today off so i can get better and not be really sick all weekend<br>  and tell him to be VERY convincing, it works all the time|`|XBlokskEaa	Have him punch himself in the crotch so he throws up everywhere. *Warning this may result in loss of sperm...and/or (a) testicle(s). Don't try that. He can swallow a bit of chewing tobacco, that makes you throw up. Or have him watch 2 girls 1 cup on the internet. That will make him throw up for sure.|`|dvw0Ui9Laa	well he can either puke... put tomato sauce in the toilet..<br>  tell his mom/dad that his stomach hurts really bad..<br>  he's has a really bad headache and is sensitive to lightt.<br>  <br>  i hate when stuff like that happens. good luck!|`|GVUkCcwxaa	Ever thought of faking it?

HpWCjBv6aa	As everyone else has said, it's a way of "dieting", where you only take in water.  No calories, no carbohydrates, absolutely nothing that's good for your body.<br>  <br>  The longest I've heard of someone fasting (water, juice, or nothing) for is around a week and a half.

nRFZwdN4aa	I don't think it necessarily is.....because having low self-esteem / confidence is a natural reaction to being excluded or 'failing' at something. <br>  <br>  For example, human beings are social animals. We are wired to feel happier when we are accepted by a group. If we are rejected or someone does not seem to like us, our instincts kick in. We feel upset. <br>  <br>  When most cultures were hunter-gatherer, it was imperative not to be excluded from your group. Otherwise, you would be in danger. This instinct is built in even now. <br>  <br>  Calling low self confidence / esteem a 'mental illness' indiscriminately can be counterproductive. It is invalidating to hear that 'Oh, you have low self esteem because you are mentally ill.' (That basically says that 'it's all in your head - you have no reason to think you are struggling in real life'.)  <br>  <br>  To mentalize every real life concern is to trivialize it in a sense. If you give A-grade effort but are getting F's, you are bound to be upset. Same goes with being unjustly blamed or unfairly judged. It is NORMAL to feel upset over certain things and then wonder what is wrong with you if things keep going wrong. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it can be part of a 'mental illness' like depression, but the causes of that depression need to be examined before prematurely labelling it.|`|Xkq5kHLNaa	Usually not. Depends a lot on how old you are. Young people often have issues with self esteem because of lack of experience and the need to learn about self. If you are an older, more established individual- I would suggest finding something to give your life more purpose. A spiritual endeavor, perhaps. This will boost your confidence and fill the void that you're feeling. Just a suggestion, take it for what its worth. Hope that it helps. You probably aren't suffering from mental illness though. See a psychologist if its really worrying you.|`|VtDqUgc0aa	it isn't alone a mental illness, but it can be a symptom of a mental illness.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	No, but it's a symptom.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	it wouldn't fall under mental illness unless it was keeping you from your basic everyday functions.
iSEgH0sxaa	I have cold sores, from the same thing. I know this sounds crazy but is working for me, I get a clothes with warm water and some soap, and then I rub the tops of the cold sores, and then I put peroxide on them, then after they finishing foaming I splash water on them, and then I put some neosporin on them. It is working so far for me.
SYccJO3Haa	Hi there - muscle is heavier. This is why you can gain weight on the scales when you start an exercise programme, even though you may feel slimmer and find your clothes fit better.<br>  <br>  1 litre of muscle weighs approximately 1.06 kg and 1 litre of fat weighs approximately 0.9 kg. This is all to do with the density of fat vs muscle. Put simply - muscle takes up less space than fat so people with more muscle and a lower body fat percentage literally look smaller and can wear smaller size clothes than the same weight people with a much higher fat content.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Zoe|`|eDjdCw48aa	Muscle because it is more like solid that is why steel will most likely way more than Jello or Jelly|`|c7Zmlediaa	Well, by VOLUME, muscle weighs more than fat.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, 1lb of fat weighs just as much as 1lb of muscle, but the fat takes up more space since it's less dense.

b8c37eb86d404fad058abf3d53192dadaa	Well, if you're a new BCP user this happens. Well, it happens to us seasoned BCP users too. All "the pill" is is hormones. Until your body gets used to the change and it all balances out, your periods will be screwed up. After I had my last child and got back on the pill, it took over a year to straighten out. Now it's like clockwork.|`|100dcbd90a6bbd37ac35f5e4d5e7b638aa	Well consitering the pill modulates your hormones, you should expect a change in your period, i would not be worried however, try waiting another month to see if your period has regulated, it should however be less. if it continues to be persistant as it is, seek your  doctor's help.|`|409f65cc28a27b89b6fd10f4ec7fb2abaa	That can be a side affect actually.  The doctor I talked to said you can get no period, just spotting when you do get it, or normal flow or heavy.  I have had mine for like 1 and a half weeks.|`|ad8d0246afde51382a6a2947d018fd36aa	Your body takes a good 3 months to fully adjust to having all those extra substances in it.  Try talking to your doctor about a lower dose estrogen pill. Alesse or Microgestin are good ones.  They are lower dose of the hormone estrogen but still as effective at preventing pregnancy.  . If you want something more name brand you can ask for  Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo.|`|b65e3d75e305da0e5ba9051fb9e564c1aa	I was on the pill then I as on the shot for three years. No I woudn't worry. That's normal. But if it keeps on happening. Then go see your doctor.|`|ed8ea5e4218ccae7762cf1bc6af815b2aa	you may need to switch brands of pills it could be too strong for you.they have like a hundred different brands out there.talk to your gyno about your heavy long periods and they will fix it promise good luck-cookie
AA11315360	You dont pick your birth control pills like picking out new shoes. Every birth control pill (there are about 30 of them or more!) has a different dose of drugs and the doctor has to figure out the right one for you. Also YAZ is expensive because it is a brand name, no generic. Take whatever the doctor suggests.<br>  MANY girls even at your age take birth control to prevent painful periods. Tell your mom that a girl at your school said she went on pills as recommended by her doctor to stop her painful periods. And that she is not having sex. It is medicine to help with periods (and seriously it does work). My periods became shorter and less painful when I started taking the pill.<br>  <br>  I started taking the pill not because I was having sex but because I wanted to use Accutane (a brand name acne pill) and it is required by law that a woman has to be on the pill to have the drug (because it causes serious birth defects in babies).<br>  <br>  Anyway you could just go see a doctor without telling your mom why. Just tell her you need a physical for school and go in alone to see the doctor (make your mom stay in the waiting room) and then tell the doctor the real reason you are there. They may tell your mom but they may not. They want to help you not get you into trouble.<br>  <br>  Just tell your mom the lie story about a girl at school getting the pill for periods and try to convince her. Tell her that you would prefer to get a doctors opinion (if she is against it and doesnt believe you). Have a meeting with a doctor with your mom there and get the doctor's opinion. They will tell your mom that yes it does help prevent painful periods.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|QbOYIixuaa	Talk to your mom. Tell her about your irregular periods. Let her know you were nervous to confront her but you were most concerned about regulating your periods. Yaz is great for your skin and hair. You don't need a pap smear for birth control but some doctors may insist. A pap really isn't half as bad as you think. For your first time it might be embarrassing and scary. It's an effective way of monitoring your feminine insides. It's a good thing. It doesn't hurt too much, it's just uncomfortable and you feel pressure when the doctor opens your cervix.|`|ZvU093GPaa	yes you will need to go to the gynecologist and get a full examination including blood test . and yes you will need parental consent at your age. but if you explain to your mother your reason for it I think she will understand more than you think. talk to her and reassure her you are not sexually active and have no plans in the forcible future to become  active. after all she has already gown through this in her life. she may surprise you and have more Information for you than you might think.|`|gAJHfQGaaa	YES YOU DO NEED A PAP TO GET A SCRIPT FROM A DOCTOR FOR BIRTH CONTROL (except if you're a virgin). Just wanted to mention that. :)<br>  <br>  Pap smears are really no big deal. It's like when people freak you out about how horrible it will be when you lose you virginity, but after you do you're like, "That was not dramatic at all." Not that I'm suggesting you go out and shag. Anyway, getting a pap take less than two minutes and you're done. Fear not! And besides, pap smears give you all sorts of important info about you body. Like do you have cervical cancer cells or STD's.<br>  <br>  I have been where you are. You'll be surprised how cool parents can be when you go to them about these mature issues. The worst thing that can happen is she'll say 'no.' How pissed would she be if you went behind her back and she found out? If you do that you run the risk of her making assumptions that you're sleeping around with everybody. <br>  <br>  Be realistic though. She has probably been there too.|`|xCifmFfkaa	If you're a virgin, and you explain to your doctor that you want to go on BC to help regulate your periods (provided that's what it's really for), then your doc should have no problem prescribing, and I don't see that an exam would be too likely in order since you're not sexually active.<br>  <br>  If you are sexually active, then your doctor (I'm guessing a pediatrician still, because of your age) is most likely going to refer you to a gyno for an exam, and the gyno will take it from there.<br>  <br>  Because of your age, I don't see any way that you would be able to go about getting BC on your own-- either way, you're going to need your mom's help, for things like paying for the prescription, picking it up, doctors appts, etc. The only alternative would be a clinic, but clinics vary widely and you may not be able to get it that way, either.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you need to remember that because you're so young, your periods are bound to be irregular-- and count on it being that way. Your body hasn't found it's 'sync' yet. But if you feel you really want to get on it, you should talk to your mom.<br>  <br>  And who knows, it may be the icebreaker you need to help open up your relationship.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|5PWEBOj0aa	If its for medical reasons then there really shouldnt be a reason to be scared to talk to her about it... asking because you want permission to have sex is a different story...  You would need to go to a doctor or planned parenthood of some sort... you would most likely need to get a pap, you might even have endometriosis which is very painfull. They have Seasonale and Seasonique and Jolessa which after a few months on them you will only get your period like 4 times a year and they only last like maybe 3 days.. DONT get the shot!! I did and I gained 75lbs and didnt have a period for two years, but it made me an emotional headcase.. .bad stuff!! I have also heard good things about yaz...<br>  <br>  if you reeeeeally dont want to talk to your mom... ask to go get a physical and talk to your primary care doctor and she if he could recommend it and maybe your mom might be more understanding...|`|2eztcCO0aa	First, you're only 14.  I don't think the menstrual cycle really gets regular for a couple more years at least.<br>  <br>  Yaz, from what I've read, is for more serious problems than you're having.  Take some Tylenol for the cramps.  You might want to just start taking it at regular intervals as soon as your period starts.  <br>  <br>  If that doesn't help, talk to your Mom about your problems without mentioning the pill.  Ask to see a doctor about it, and if a pill is what you need, your doctor can bring it up.<br>  <br>  Pap smears aren't that bad.  They look worse than they feel.  The doctor knows how to do them so they're not more than a little uncomfortable.  The worst part is opening your legs while the doctor shines a bright light on you.  It's likely the most light that part of you will ever have on it!|`|LX0vjwXPaa	Go to the Health Department.  Your local government may have a method of getting it to you with minimal parental involvement, if any.  Obviously it's a sensitive subject with lots of teens.  You could always just buck up and tell your Mother, but be sure to stress it's not so you can have wanton sex, but to control your painful periods.|`|4HJYZyo3aa	Just tell her about you're irregularity, and pain. <br>  <br>  She'll understand, and be more willing to take you to the doctor. <br>  <br>  .....just tell your mom, and have her take you to a GYN, you will have to have a pap smear, only if you are sexually active. <br>  <br>  ..and if you do have to have one, its not as bad as it sounds or looks <br>  <br>  ...its not pleasant by all means, but its not painful. They make really small ones, for younger people like you.|`|9WgZZFGfaa	Ive suffered with bad periods all my life some months fainting getting sick ive tried out all sorts of pills they ve made me very sick some side affects headaches etc now i know there is one out there for me but after tryin 3 types i gave up! Then a friend of mine told me she heard about a magnet in the health food shop i got one and four months on i don't know myself what country you liven in?? its called my mate magnet google it and it should come up! Hope this helps as i know what your going through with pain and irregular|`|K8mKH21zaa	You know, if you're only getting birth control for fixing irregular and painful periods, then it should be ok talking to your mom.  I think she'll understand.  You might run into a problem if she assumes that you want Yaz for "other" reasons, but again, if you're honest it should be alright :)|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	No you don't need a pap smear. At 14 its pretty normal to have irregular periods. You don't need your parents permission to get birth control.|`|vdXnvJwMaa	You can go to a planned parenthood.  They will do it free of charge since you have no income. Also they are not allowed to tell your parents if that is what you choose.  Yes they will do a pap, but you wil be getting 1 a year for the rest of your life and it is completely normal.  although it is kind of embarrassing it is really important for your health.  I know its scary but they see it all day every day. Talk with the doctors at planned parenthood and they will help  you choose a birth control that is right for you. Good luck,|`|WoxMH0wZaa	Just be honest with your mom. Tell her what your problem is and hope she understands. You have to see a doctor (your regular doctor is fine) and just tell them about your periods and tell them you'd like to give birth control a try. I've been on and off birthcontrol since I was like 13 for irregular periods, and I was never given a pap smear until I was about 16 or 17 (and it's not that bad, honest!). I've used yaz before, and had good results on it, but only your doctor can tell you which birth control is best for you. Just be open, mature, and calm with your mom and hope she understands, because unfortunately you are too young to see a doctor and get birth control by yourself. good luck!|`|DhUMjZxtaa	you're so young...don't go on them.

o1l5JHHTaa	He never mentions that he doesn't approve Alcohol. He said don't over do it. Ever seen people over doing it. That's when it's a problem. Your impaired(Dumb) and you lose reason. Don't drink for getting wasted(Drunk) just enjoy it reasonablly. Don't drink and drive. Stay away from people who can't handle Alcohol(Retards). Some Scholars say that Mosas Probually drank Beer for the remander of the flood. Since it was good enough to drink. Also you choose to drink. It's a bad choce but pray, ask for forgiveness, and learn from your pain. <br>  P.S. To the Hacker(s) (Leave me alone you mofo's. I hope that you'll end up in the worst pain of your miserable lives and to you all who are involed. Go to oprah if you want to see any drama!)|`|6YnwXCIaaa	Maybe the reason this doesn't make sense is that all these writings are by different people, each with their own biases.  Even if you believe this is the word of God, it's not like he transcribed his own words.  <br>  <br>  You need to decide for yourself whether or not you think people will this disease deserve compassion.  If you would have appreciated some understanding while going through your ordeal, I think you have your answer there.|`|4ea275b41b6c56f0526600a3f5521117aa	God doesn't hate anything, least of all drunks. Hating is not a practical solution to anything. It's not going to solve the problem.<br>   I think you are getting too wrapped up in a label. Let's not try and solve alcoholism with flip value judgments. If you want Christ to be with you and help you, it would be a good idea to stay sober and focus on Christ. That's the main thing.<br>  Alcoholism is a disease. That much is certain. There's no doubt about that. There might be a kind of disorder that makes a person more likely to struggle with alcoholism and you may have a family member that had it in your family. Therefore, you are also more likely to have a problem with drinking or drugs. Don't let all the language and rhetoric about discouraging people from starting, confuse you about staying sober. That's two different things.<br>  For those that have never struggled with it, it's OK to just tell them to not start. Actually, I think lots of non-drinkers may get carried away with that. They talk too much and they use severe language. They can come across very unsympathetic. I think this serves no purpose. It is very insensitive. Cheap talk will never help the alcoholic. He needs compassion. For those that have never been there, this is all they know.<br>  Try and be patient with them. They are naive and have never known anything else. I think this reflects a perspective guided by fear. In fact, an awful lot of rhetoric in church in guided by fear of Hell and damnation. Things none of us really understand. So why do they go there? Because they don't know anything else. They have never known anything what they read in the Bible. They cling to it like a life raft in the middle of the ocean. <br>  Many people haven't really come to know Christ like you have. You have relied upon Him to bring you out of your problem, and He has saved you. But as for them, they have only grasped the idea of His saving grace. They don't seem to have ever put it into practice. All to many of them, talk the talk, but don't walk the walk. It's an all too common occurence.<br>  AA was started by people that have been there, not by these people you see in church. They know and understand what you have been through. Trust that. Rely upon that. Understand that someone knows and someone cares. But you won't find that in everyone. They just don't understand how tough it can be. It's a good thing someone does. Let that reassure you that God can find a way. That anyone can find help, if they call on Him, but unfortunately not everyone does. And some people can be hard to cure. They can really make it tough for those that can and do get over it. It's a mixed bag.<br>  Let us give thanks that we who know how it is. We want to help and we want to find a way to make sure others get the help they need. We are always praying for them. And we do what we can to let them know someone cares. That's the main thing. Do the best you can.<br>  Don't let them get to you. If they don't understand, maybe it's true they never will. Let that go. Don't waste your time on them. There's someone somewhere that needs what you offer, and they will be glad you care. Let that guide you. Stay postive as best you can, and hang in there. You're doing great.|`|TdqeC0vmaa	love the sinner hate the sin. <br>  disease or not -staying that way refusing to seek help - is selfish and sinful. Alcoholism is part gentic disorder. But their are sober alcoholics and drunk alcoholics and those somewhere in between. God doesn't hate alcoholics. Nor does he hate practicing alcoholics. We are to be forgiven for our sins though him. Both the sober and the practicing alcoholic have the disease. But one is working to not allow it and everything that goes along with it to consume him. God has love for everyone no matter the size of the sin. It is part disease and part choice. <br>  <br>  we should have compassion for everyone sining or not. No sin is greater or lesser in gods eyes. Also in the verse "drunkeness" may be more than simply alcoholism. Its indulging to excess at the waste of yourself and the risk of others. It is one of the seven sins of glutony. It creates idleness. <br>  <br>  Also in here is the fact that the bible was written a long time ago. And if you are one to take the bible literally you have to give room for how someone would literally write about something in words and comprehension available to them at the time. Schizophrenia for instance would have been written about as demonic possession. Weve come to understand more about how addictions work. So now it is understood that alcoholism is in part a genetic disease. But still to know you have something that is a ruin to you and others and to choose to continue it is wrong. <br>  <br>  But everyone falters. It is human. Only god has the right to judge. And he forgives all sin. <br>  <br>  At least all that is the way that Ive tried to reconcile this in my own mind. <br>  <br>  I would say I believe in God. Am fairly sure jesus. I don't go to church and my family was never religious. The whole idea of spirituality seems a little hard for me to settle into. I was in AA for a time. And the above is how I think about it at least to the best that I could put it into words|`|NbgxNAYZaa	Drunkenness can be a choice. Just like gluttony, which is also listed as a sin. When a person has a weakness and tries hard to overcome it, asking God for help then he will forgive and strengthen that person. But if all they do is say they are sorry after they have all ready made a wrong choice then why should God forgive them.|`|pqVWrNFtaa	This is why there is so much controversy about so much scientific facts and religion.. <br>  if you really have faith in 'god' though and do your best im sure 'god' will forgive you for your sins if you've changed your ways.|`|T6PzMyPBaa	don't dictate your life with a fictional character.|`|F0ImwHlUaa	When Jesus pass his cup what was that?

It all adds up.|`|NOUL05wUaa	if you are "counting calories" you need to add all the food you have eating all day and then subtract the exercise calories from the Total.<br>  <br>  just so you know if the Treadmill says 300 calories burned you will still burn at least half of that after the exercise making it more like 450 or more calories, who knows, so those calories meters don't have much to do really with anything.
BTI0XOptaa	People use gasoline because other people tell them too. Some are so desperate to rid themselves of lice, they are willing to take desperate measures<br>  <br>  People advise others to use gasoline for head lice all the time on this site, it sickens me. Gasoline is highly toxic and highly flammable. Yet we have people suggesting we put it on our heads or even worse the heads of our children. Even if people are saying it as a joke, it's not funny. People take others advice seriously (even when its not meant to be serious) and go on to try this ridiculous method. <br>  <br>  I'm with you, this needs to stop and it needs to stop now. There are many natural remedies out there that truly do work, people need to try those.<br>  <br>  I will be back to see other responses, I can bet there will be a few funny guys who will joke about the topic.
QONP634Kaa	Yes.  when you're heavier, you have to take easy and work you way up to all that strenuous high impact exercise.  Try riding a bike or swimming until you're a little more able to handle that much shock on your feet, ankles, knees and legs.  Also make sure you're wearing good shoes too.  That makes a difference.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It's best to use a no impact cardio machine like cycling or elliptical running is hard on joints especially when over weight or older.

5f7b94c7a09ad248d51006829e8fa74caa	I don't know any things that will stop sleep walking. However, I do sleep walk quite often myself. It is completely normal and you shouldn't worry about it too much. It happens to many kids and teens during puberty and you will probably stop when you get older. You may want to try going to bed earlier to prevent sleep walking. Also, stress can also cause sleep walking. If you are stressed, try to think positive thoughts before going to bed.

If you want to get help for depression before you actually do commit suicide then go to your doctor that perscribe you medicatition and see if there's another anti- depressant that may help because this one is not really working.

No matter how many times I tried, I couldn't do it.  It wasn't until after I lost my virginity did I get used to something being up there and then I was finally able to do it but only after lots more trying.  I found it easiest with the plastic applicators (they are smoother) on the heaviest day of my period (more lubrication).  One day I just decided to do and almost forced it up there.  One you get past the initial discomfort, it does get easier and now it's nothing.  Good luck and don't rush.  oh and don't have sex just to do it either,  that wasn't the point of my post.|`|lwHJFfZ2aa	I didn't attempt to use a tampon until I was 19 or so. I happened to be in an adventurous mood and ran out of pads and since I was visiting someone I decided to try them (my mother was adamant that they never even be brought into the house, which is why I never really tried using them). It isn't something that I would recommend younger teens to try. I was a total spaz when I was your age and if I had tried them, I probably never would have attempted it again. It is something that you have to wait until you're ready to try. You'll be more responsible and level headed to remember when it is you put one in and make sure that you don't do stupid things like leave them in over night. So, wait until you're ready.

( the ladder only when i do a third workout) i hope this helps. just eat within the food guide pyramid's recomendations for a healthy diet and deffinitly eat more.|`|XZqSO94saa	For weightloss, yes.. but I would also add a little more for 'healthy' weightloss.<br>  If you're trying to maintain.. definatly add more!|`|Ndr7D8BJaa	that sounds like you ate way too little.|`|xx5Rp91Laa	Have fruit for breakfast, and maybe some hard boiled eggs, but just the whites, toss the yokes.<br>  <br>  for lunch have a sandwich maybe with no mayo.<br>  <br>  dinner looks alright.<br>  <br>  try and eat as much natural foods as possible, cut down on the carbs of corn flakes and crackers unless you use them for physical activities, up you protein.|`|1kL51soPaa	thats ok, i would add more protein ect, if you want to loose weight eat around 1200 cals a day :)
qDCIzSTbaa	Would you consider yourself not so in shape? If so, it may just be a reaction from not being used to this sort of strain.  If it really bothers you, doing some simple stretches before work would lessen, if not eliminate, the pain.
b620ee9ffe6252c90305858258e1bd65aa	I can safely say that no food does cause vaginal discharge.<br>  Sugar and starches do make candida worse so they claim but other than that there is no connection between food and vaginal discharge which is an infection.|`|boekFeqBaa	Your diet can effect your discharge but it doesn't cause it. It won't make it more or less. It would only effect the smell very very slightly.

If I were sick with it, I would want more than the doctors are recommending.  Vitamin B12 is in all kinds of foods and is something you eat every day.  It is not by any means a dangerous drug.

d0b7fc7d57763e6200ff5e46906ef8d5aa	The antibiotic will make the birth control NOT work at all.  THe reason we say wait until your next period is because this will clease you out and get rid all all the antibiotic that is hagging around in there.  When you are done taking the pills, depending on the strengh and type they stay in your system for a few days afterwards, even though you have not been taking them.  So still keep on track with your birth control, because after awhile the antibiotic will lose it potency ( a little each day ) and the birthcontrol will take back over.  Just be extra careful until you menstrate.|`|0d96f124bd7b597d27d7bfaffb5af011aa	Anitbiotics remain active in your system for up to a week after the last pill is taken.

u5HhzHDraa	Are you Catholic? =P<br>  <br>  Well, when you give up meat for forty days, it may be hard for you to start digesting meat again. Meat is harder to digest then vegetables so going with out it for over a month, and then coming back to meat MIGHT make you uncomfortable after you eat for a few days.<br>  <br>  You should be able to maintain your average, but protein is important for brain function. Can you eat Fish and Fowl? If you can eat those; eat them. If your abstaining from all meat be sure to have another source of protein. You can get protein in a few ways: eat a large variety of vegetables that have all the amino acids you need (hardest)or have nuts around, walnuts, almonds, beans etc. A lot of people are suggesting soy which is okay in little amounts, but it is thought to cause cancer if it is eaten regularly (about three times a week is a safe amount.)<br>  <br>  I hope I have answered sufficiently.|`|AA11357422	Well just eat more vegetables, the same sides you had before with meat. <br>  These are high protein veggies:<br>  Try lentils, soy products (like tofu), Hummus, nuts (almonds and such), yogurt, black beans, lima beans, quinoa, peanut butter and so on and so on!<br>  Your marks will probably go up now that you will be forced to eat cleaner food.<br>  So good luck!|`|Mt85amuCaa	yes that cool!<br>  <br>  try the "not even a quarter kg" flesh! just dont eat..|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Keeping fish in your eating, that could be shrimp and scallops as well.<br>  Include chicken and turkey if you will allow that of yourself.<br>  <br>  Keep at least fish types.<br>  <br>  Lentils and nuts are awesome for you! Humus is woman's stuff.<br>  Beans like kidney beans, canned beans in molasses sauce is good for you and molasses is a good source of iron which meats ordinarily provide. You can take out that tiny bit of fatty meat from the canned beans if you must! Haha!  When I was going to school or giving up meat for lent, I would eat these Libbey's beans in the molasses sauce, but i would add a whole lot of additional molasses, and diced onion, then heat it up to a simmer to cook the onion!...Just Amazing Man!<br>  <br>  When you are on meats, you can add some cooked beef sausage small slices to those beans done that way, and is just like home made baked beans.<br>  <br>  For 40 days, there's lots of stuff like the beans without the meat that you can do besides fish, to make for good protein source. With this type of food, you could pas the fish by if you are being really strict over the meats, but I always considered fish to be good during lent.<br>   <br>  If you are male, stay clear of the soy and Tofu type eating. It's too rich in estrogen, and you don't want for study, bumps in your emotional aspects or hormonal fluctuations. Take a supplement of Omega 3, 6 and 9 oil capsule per day for fatty acids which the brain is so dependent upon, and meats generally provide these. Oh! Ya! for lots of these type dishes and lentils, take Beano to deal with the expected extra gas! Haha! <br>  <br>  Your going to do great man!  <br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|D3hJ55XPaa	One side effect at first is that your stomach will probably not be used to eating only vegetables, but as long as you plan out your diets okay and get the problem vitamins and nutrients you'll be just fine.

XChDnnbLaa	Ive been doing "8 minute abs"<br>  on youtube. look up fitforthesummer also on youtube and click on the account named that.

Hop scotch, watching Tv and doing sit ups, dancing, dancing, dancing? haha<br>  <br>  and umm:<br>  <br>  --- toning up ----<br>  <br>  It is possible. i think. <br>  <br>  if you REALLY try at it. just dont let any extra pounds get in the way.. <br>  <br>  just try light weights maybe..<br>  <br>  -- losing weight ---<br>  in the morning if you can wake up pretty early, thats when you have the most energy! drink a bottle of water plug in your ipod or whatever and listen to music as you run! -- thats my first step.<br>  <br>  Then you go home, eat a really healthy breakfast like fruit salad or something thats nutritonal. <br>  <br>  After that you pretty much clean the house or whatever maybe take a walk while its cool, walk your pet dog, if you have one, i like to spend the morning doing that while its not so hot outside!<br>  <br>  After that you wait a few hours being active as can be, then you relax a little and do some sit ups and lift weights to your own schedule... and your own statistics like weight height goals.. or whatever.. thats what i usually do! And then i like to stretch at the beginning of the day.. haha<br>  <br>  MORE TIPS: <br>  <br>  chew gum - sugar free. It makes you not snack because if you chew it, you dont want to snack because then you will have to spit out your gum! works for me.. <br>  <br>  thats my trick tip - now read the losing weight 411<br>  <br>  EXTRA: breathing for an hour burns 60 calories, so thats a little lift off your chest haha<br>  and sleeping is the same rate :)<br>  <br>  excersise at least 60 minutes a day if you can :)<br>  -------<br>  hey, you know what? The most unexpensive weight loss thing to do, is to try to burn more calories than you eat, dont eat unhealthy like a 500 calorie diet! All that will do is make you sick, you NEED to be healthy to lose weight properly. Im trying to lose weight too! So basically here are some tips to speed up your metabolism: Drink 1-3 glasses of green tea a day<br>  Try and eat Chilli peppers somehow, ((chilli DUH )) they help. <br>  8 classes of water a day<br>  <br>  the more active you are, the faster your metabolism will grow to be. <br>  <br>  did you know that breathing for an hour burns 60 calories all on its own? And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do! <br>  <br>  Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things. Bread is a bad, so try to stick to thin, HIGH in fiber, slices :) <br>  <br>  you can google all the stuff and before you know it you will feel so good about it all and IM actually excited to start working out and all that, just because I know what it will do for me!<br>  <br>  I hope i helped :D|`|481a43c36ce16419eb0d6762bb896606aa	I was a size 14 in the beginning of November and I went on a diet.

rwXcLTNvaa	It may be heat rash which causes heat, itchyness and irritation in forms of little red bums in clusters. It is mostly found between legs and under armpits. It is caused by the blockage of your sweat poures causing them to retain extra sweat (urea) and they become irritated like this.<br>  <br>  Treatment is to wear loose clothing and let it pass.

But if you feel you must loose weight, i would suggest making sure you burn more calories than you eat. The easiest way to do this is, to not to eat less,  but to exercise more than you already do. Also, the more muscle mass your body has, the more calories you burn. So I would suggest doing 30 min of crunches, push-ups and squats. What ever you do, don't stop eating. Hope this helps!|`|83jm7SLoaa	i would have 2 say about....1,500 calories.and try the xersices that make you sweat the most.|`|Od5m2uPRaa	Don't eat, bang alot of asian women, smoke a lot of dope, and run from the cops.|`|QhNI9ZIwaa	dont eat

It's time to get out of the shell you are in.  Quit feeling sorry for yourself, and pick yourself up by your bootstraps.  It might be beneficial if you volunteered at a shelter or Salvation Army or something like that.  That would help with the loneliness, and might be you would start counting your blessings, instead of your problems.|`|a7f44582f7bbfb8996d883accbaf5a63aa	nope. that's an emotion. it just proves that you're human. i'm also eighteen and i have been a loner since grade school. in the past few years, people have started to like me though. it's very comforting. even with that, i still sometimes feel lonely. don't worry about it though. i mean don't think you're 'lame' for it.
jQwYoRCXaa	Hey I am 23 weeks tomorrow. I have been doing great other then being tired...I also have a 1 and 2 year old so I am pretty busy. I do feel somewhat unprepared, by this time with my other two I had almost everything done...I have been out of town since the month after I found out I was pregnant so I am feeling a little overwhelmed. I have what I need picked out, just havent bought it yet. My fiancee and me are also buying a house in april or may, that needs a lot of "cosmetic" work (everything from the floors to cupboards is straight up '70s). So I am kind of getting nervous about getting that done in time. <br>  Of course when it comes to me thinking about seeing, holding, hugging and kissing my new baby, I get anxious and could care less about all my worries. I cant wait until he is here!<br>  <br>  Well I am writing a novel, it just feels so nice to be able to tell all this to someon who probably is going thru the same feelings, my fiancee doesnt seem to worry about anything too much...Im gonna end this with a God Bless, Good Luck and Congrats!

Just learn to slow down & relax & NO PORN.  Don't get in such a big hurry to get it just right.  If you become over anxious - you done shot your wad ahead of time.  If you will take it easy & just follow The Yellow Brick Road, things will work themselves out.|`|3WeAfZNraa	Any MD|`|87pV5lvZaa	I agree with a previous poster that 90% of the problem is anxiety and/or over excitement.  Relaxation and patience are key.  However, if you truly want a doctor's advice, then you definitely should see a urologist.  As to a pill for premature ejaculation...I've never heard of such a thing.  After doing a physical exam to insure nothing is wrong, the urologist will probably teach you breathing techniques and mental imaging techniques that will help delay ejaculation.<br>  <br>  P.S.  You may also want to try heavy-duty condoms or condoms with numbing gel on the inside.  These will decrease sensation, thus making it more difficult for you to orgasm.  If I were you, I probably would try this before spending the money on a doctor...<br>  <br>  P.P.S.  Viagra is for impotence, not premature ejaculation.|`|Deno6G0baa	Tips To Prevent Premature Ejaculation<br>  <br>  The Start Stop Technique: The basic technique is stimulation of the penis until just before the point of orgasm, and then stopping stimulation until arousal is lower. Start stimulating again and the process is repeated until desired length of time until orgasm is reached, You may lose your erection when you stop the stimulation, but just start again. The most Important part of this exercise is to try everyday if possible. This exercise may take 3-5 months for improvement.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pelvic floor muscles: Stop the flow of urine while you are peeing. As you are peeing, intentionally stop the flow of urine. Do this several times until you can clearly feel the muscle you are using to stop the flow. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://sexualweakness.com/premature.html" rel="nofollow">http://sexualweakness.com/premature.html</a>|`|Mt85amuCaa	can i go with you too?|`|EheKroMpaa	No pill yet, at least not in the states.

UPPER RIGHT, LOWER LEFT AND LOWER RIGHT. <br>  THE TERM IS PROPERLY CALLED SCALING.<br>  BECAUSE OF THE NEED OF ANESTHESIA NORMALLY ONLY 2 QUADS ARE DONE AT ANY  1 TIME|`|bf5cDEyZaa	The perio scaling procedure is basically going down on the roots of the teeth, under the gums and clean the deposits that the toothbrush cannot reach.<br>  Quad refers to one quarter of the teeth - either upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right.<br>  <br>  Hygienists often misuse or misbill this procedure... they either talk you into getting it done (needed or not) or charge you for the procedure but in reality only perform a regular cleaning. <br>  If you don't need perio scaling but have it done, it can cause you plenty of harm but no good at all. <br>  In our corrupt and money hungry world, it is a must to fully understand your needs and the treatment you are receiving. <br>  <br>  I do not recommend getting dental work done by an unlicensed person. It's not only illegal but also, knowing that he has not yet passed his board exams, puts you at fault if something goes wrong. I would also question the equipment he uses... Careful! You can get HIV and other diseases from equipment that were reused or were not properly sterilized. <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11315360	The first answerer is the correct answer. Quads mean that the mouth is divided into 4 sections or quadrants. And scaling means using instruments (metal or water/ultrasonic scaler) to remove tartar. They will be doing only one side of the mouth 2 quads and then possible work on the 2nd part another day (just because sometimes the test doesnt require the whole mouth cleaned so they do part of it and have you come back for the rest of it when the test is over).

f4gRedsqaa	based on height and weight nutritionists tell you how many calories you need per day<br>  basically they tell you how to divide those calories throughout the day so that your energy levels stay consistent and your metabolism stays high. what you ate wasn't tons but it wasnt bad either. i would say thats an okay amount. <br>  they only help if you are motivated and disciplined to following a mealplan. they also explain what happens if you don't eat enough, or eat the wrong things. for example if you eat only simple sugars for breakfast your energy will last around 1.5 hrs...where as if you eat carbs and protein your energy level could last you 3 or more hours. usually your body tells you that you need food every 2hrs...after 2hrs its the SMALLEST tinge of hunger, and we usually ignore it if we are busy. the body goes "okay ill just use some of the energy i stored in my body" so it uses that until we eat again. if we don't eat after say 4hrs...the body starts getting a bit upset. but still goes "okay ill just keep using the stored energy"....after say 7 or 8 hours the body gets mad and starts eating ketones. ketones are energy stored in muscle, and brain. and which is the most important muscle of the body? the heart. so you can see how this is bad. <br>  <br>  basically they'll explain things like this. how we need different nutrients for different things. how we shouldnt cut parts of diet out because it affects our systems.<br>  ex. we need protein. if we didn't eat protein we would retain water- and look bloated! who wants that?
7684a7ed9de7f8216af5dd5ef8524cffaa	The symptoms can also be for low blood sugar.  If you are drinking your 64 ounces of water a day, and you are eating breakfast, lunch and dinner, add a bit of a snack inbetween breakfast and lunch, and see if that helps relieve the symptoms.<br>  <br>  Keep the sun off your head with a hat or umbrella whenever possible.

Do treadmill/bike/jump rope, etc... not the same thing all the time, cuz your body will adapt to it and you don't want that.
GvBtoKsqaa	lol i agree with your first two answerers, that's a bad idea.<br>  <br>  It all comes down to energy. If you spend five hours in the gym most of your energy will be spent after the first hour and the remaining 4 hours will be mostly slogging through your workout and it won't be effective.<br>  <br>  But if you work out for an hour, relax the rest of the day and get a good night's sleep then come back the next day you'll come back with recharged batteries and you'll have a MUCH better workout.<br>  <br>  If you are paying per visit at your gym just get a monthly membership, it's totally the way to go.<br>  <br>  I go 4X a week and I think that works well for me.|`|2WqvVRa7aa	Don't you have a membership where you pay monthly?

4zQEvzCsaa	To lose cellulite, you need to lose fat. Go swimming or running because that'll really target your legs. If the cellulite is there but fat isn't an issue, buy one of those body firming creams (Nivea have a great range of them) and buy a loofah and dry-brush your legs. This stimulates lymphatic circulation to get all the toxins out. Start doing squats and lunges to lean out the legs and tone them up, and lastly get your legs waxed because that'll last longer and see a dermatologist about the black dots because I'm not sure what they are (if your hair is darker, it's probably just the hair follicles which are completly normal, but if it worries you that much, get a DIY tannin cream).|`|8ebGghbbaa	You could go to the gym and try to tone up your legs. If your boyfriend doesn't want to look at you because of your legs he isn't your boyfriend, he's just a tool. I'm sure nair would remove some of the hair and make it less noticable.

AA11357422	Its not the actual optics that give women a wider field of vision. Meaning we men and women see the same physically, but when it comes to how a mans brain and a woman's brain translates what the eyes see. Its a totally different game. <br>  <br>  For women their brain is doesn't focus on one thing only, its able to take in a wider scope of vision. Interpreting almost the whole picture, and choosing details from it.<br>  <br>  A mans brain focuses on one thing at a time, and it needs to be in the middle of the of the field of view to be interpreted. So men need to look at the object they are interested in.

zzkmdusEaa	Like the first answerer said...The family physician is a no.<br>  <br>  You need to go to a clinic and tell them your problem and that the other medications just aren't doing it for you. You need to convince them that everything else has failed and you have no other options but medical marijuana. Usually the patient doesn't ask the doctor if they are eligible for the card, the doctor just recommends it to them. If you ask them if you can get medical marijuana, it most likely won't look good and will probably end your chances at that clinic. Unless, however, you can provide good reasoning behind it and show them that it's legitimately for your pain and suffering and not for recreation.<br>  <br>  Don't go to the family physician. Go to another clinic or hospital, use Google, Yellowpages, etc. to find local clinics near you that can help you.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Haha, no. Not even a little bit. What you have wouldn't even rate one for a little bit. Sports injuries don't qualify.<br>  <br>  There are different forms of chronic pain. Something like a migraine or glaucoma pain is not going to be the same kind of pain received from inflammation of ligaments.<br>  <br>  Also, what your doctor gave you is known as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. Something like Motrin, maybe a bit stronger. Are the pills huge and have a big 800 on them? If so, it's Motrin. If it were severe inflammation, they would have given you steroids. And no, not the anabolic kind.<br>  <br>  Nice try. No dice.|`|hrBVwQxTaa	I would suggest you talk to your doctor about this. Maybe there are other medications you can take that dont require you to get surgery to heal yourself, and if he knew that taking medical marijuana was the best for you, then maybe he would bring it up himself...?<br>  <br>  hope for the best [:|`|rMbmVzEqaa	No offense, but you'd be stupid to ask a family physician to write you reccomendation for medical marijuana.<br>  <br>  <br>  Think about it. The major pharm. companies want the doctors to write prescriptions for synthesized medicines.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Go to a clinic that specializes in referrals for medical marijuana. That's your best bet.<br>  <br>  <br>  A minute on google and you should be able to find a local clinic.<br>  <br>  <br>  I live in Los Angeles and there are about 100 locally.|`|dSBjBB60aa	No. Medical marijuana card is if you are already almost dying. You even said you don't think its that serious. So the answer would be no|`|AA10450066	Don't know what state your in but almost all of them have what are called "pain management" doctors that specialize in the area of pain,They're usually anesthesiologists that do this because their specialty has to do with all types of "chronic" pain.If the pain is that bad then ask your doctor for a referral to one.As far as the medical marijuana card, unless you have HIV, AIDS, CA, or certain eye problems that can't be helped with laser surgery or other modern technology then I wouldn't give that idea any more consideration.|`|CCyqHFAGaa	excuse me, but your doctor will not judge you based on pain. i would DEFINITELY talk to your physician about your issues. patients with chronic pain for sure counts for a card (its not hard to get one ((depending on your state))) but yes you are probably eligable for a card.

For most people it's pretty easy to gain weight, but it takes a lot of work to gain muscle. <br>  <br>  100 pounds of fat (which I do not recommend) might take you a year, depending on your metabolism. 100 pounds of muscle.

0370fd46af40ff0a67a8182e1d0051a2aa	Be proud of being shy, that makes you a nice person.  It might help you be more comfortable with your own personality, and that will help you relate to others.  This above all other things, to thine own self be true.  The world doesn't need more extroverts, a few kind people who listen are needed most.  Be happy with what you are.|`|6a3839bf91f4d46891b9228d2e051926aa	Maybe you have an anxiety disorder. My little sister used to be shy and scared all of the time. After years of feeling alienated and afraid of the world she sought help. She was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. She saw the counselor once a week and took some anti-depressants for awhile. Now, she is off the anti-depressants and no longer needs counseling. She was taught ways to deal with her feelings and how to turn things around so they are positive and not so scary. It's a pretty common thing for people to have shyness but sometimes, it crosses over to something more than just being shy. I am really sorry that people are being mean to you about it. Sometimes people can be really ignorant, trust me it's them and not you. There is help out there for you. You are not alone.|`|Rh92ZClwaa	I'm shy too,<br>  <br>  It sounds too easy if I just say to not care what other people think.  But try that.

7Qy385Gtaa	Well, be advised that psychiatrists are likely to provide you with anti-depressants the side effect of most of which is STRONG SUICIDAL THOUGHT. Sorry, I am not kidding.<br>  <br>  There's a difference. Psychologists are not doctors from medical viewpoint and can't prescribe you pills, perform a brain surgery or give you an electroshock. If they think you should take pills, they should send you to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrist is a doctor from medical viewpoint and can give you pills, electroshock or brain surgery which are the only methods psychiatry uses. Brain surgeries like prefrontal lobotomy found its place in horror movies where it belongs and is disappearing from psychiatry. Electroshocks are still being given to the people despite no results and serious damage caused to the patients. Modern psychiatry focuses on drugs. Psychiatrists prescribed LSD and ecstasy as medicine in the past and their modern drugs are said to be even more dangerous. Some psychiatrists however may be using alternative methods or psychology but that is not psychiatry. Psychiatry has been using 1) brain surgeries 2) shocks (not only electroshocks but also insulin shocks) 3) drugs. Psychology was always more about talking to you, listening to you and explaining things for you and giving you advices what you should do. However, psychology is indeed a mixture of different theories written by different authors - there is really no ONE psychology. Psychologists and Psychiatrists didn’t like each other in the beginning due to completely different approach which is more than obvious but as time passed they learnt to get along somehow.<br>  I wouldn’t play with psychiatry at all - see the vids below.<br>  <br>  school <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABmVOS0s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABmVOS...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZ9YTnSkLc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZ9YTnSk...</a><br>  <br>  A must see new document - story told by psychiatrists, psychologists and other professionals - it CAN save your life<br>  <a href="http://www.cchr.org/#/videos/making-a-killing-introduction" rel="nofollow">http://www.cchr.org/#/videos/making-a-ki...</a><br>  <br>  Alternatively<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPUHUpfDVgY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPUHUpfDV...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHu7Ik36128" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHu7Ik361...</a>|`|GXiCrhVYaa	A psychiatrist is an M.D. who can prescribe psychiatric meds. Some shrinks have also been trained in "talk therapy." So they will not just prescribe meds but also give you psychotherapy. Shrinks who prescribe and do talk therapy are becoming more and more rare these days.<br>  <br>  A (talk) therapist usually has a master's degree in social work, mental health counseling, or sometimes psychiatric nursing. At least where I live (in NYS), social workers are HIGHLY trained and qualified to work as therapists. In some states, anyone can call themselves a psychotherapist, although states are getting more strict about this.<br>  <br>  A psychologist is a talk therapist with a Ph.D. in psychology. They have more academic training than the therapists mentioned above. <br>  <br>  In your case, I would try to find a psychologist to see for a diagnosis and to suggest a treatment plan. 2nd choice would be a licensed psychotherapist (like a social worker, etc.). They could provide services similar to a psychologist.<br>  <br>  My other choices would be a general practitioner doctor. They don't have a lot of training in mental health, and some of them will try to push psych meds onto you. However, a doctor might be a good source of referral to psychotherapists and psychiatrists.<br>  <br>  Also, you could go straight to a psychiatrist. They have a lot of training in mental health issues and psych meds. The problem is that most of them are prone to prescribing pills, even when other alternative treatments might be better. For example, sometimes psychotherapy is more appropriate than psych meds. Sometimes, therapy plus meds is the best option. I wish you well.|`|iybezfi6aa	A psychiatrist is a medical doctor speciallizing in mental disorders. They diagnose and prescribe medication.

After that you should see a talk therapist.|`|AA11865529	Depends on the state. <br>  <br>  Psychiatrists have been to medical school and should be able to spot medical causes of depression. They can prescribe medication. Contrary to what someone else says, most psychiatrists do talk therapy in addition to medication. And they also have to be trained in "talk" therapy. They train for at least three years beyond medical school in psychiatry.<br>  <br>  Psychologist - have a Ph.D. In some places, they can prescribe medication. They do talk therapy. They have more education than the MSW and MFCC.<br>  <br>  MSW - these are social workers. Some of them do counseling as well. MFCC is similar, they are marriage, family, and child councilors. They do talk therapy but are also more likely to focus on family issues as part of your treatment.<br>  <br>  Therapist can be any of these. They are people who do therapy, which is an important part of treatment for mental illness. <br>  <br>  Given what you have said, go to a psychiatrist. They can always refer you to one of the others if that is what you need.<br>  <br>  Your family doctor might be okay, but some of them think they can treat these conditions when they really aren't qualified.<br>  <br>  If you are an adolescent, look for someone who specializes in that.

5fc988089619d04a3fe36a0c65e67a08aa	DEGENERACION MACULAR <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Se trata de una enfermedad degenerativa que afecta al centro de la retina en personas mayores de 60 a?os. Es la segunda causa de ceguera más frecuente en los ancianos, por detrás de la diabetes.<br>  <br>  La porción central de la retina se llama mácula y es la parte responsable de la función visual fina y discriminativa. Es la zona donde la visión adquiere perspectiva de espacio y sirve para leer , conducir u otras visiones más especializadas. Cuando se produce la degeneración macular, la mácula se convierte en la zona de la retina más afectada. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  · Causas<br>  <br>  Se han planteado diversas teorías al respecto. En ocasiones se culpa a la luz ultravioleta y otras veces se?alan a los factores nutricionales.<br>  <br>  La retina es la parte de ojo sensible a la luz que está situada en la parte posterior del mismo. Tiene la función de convertir la luz recibida en estímulos nerviosos que se transmiten al cerebro. Es un tejido muy sensible y peque?as alteraciones en ella pueden llevar a la ceguera<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  · Síntomas<br>  <br>  El más característico es la pérdida de agudeza visual.<br>  <br>  Los síntomas se pueden presentar de dos formas distintas:<br>  - La forma seca se caracteriza por la pérdida de visión central y es progresiva. Es una atrofia central macular.<br>  <br>  - La forma húmeda es de aparición más aguda y provoca una visión distorsionada o de líneas extra?as. Es una atrofia más difusa con hemorragias constantes en toda la retina.<br>  <br>  <br>  · Diagnóstico<br>  <br>  A partir de los síntomas característicos, como la pérdida de visión, se realiza un examen del fondo del ojo mediante la dilatación de la pupila. En ella se pueden observar cambios de los vasos sanguíneos. Además, se puede realizar una angiografía con fluorescencia.<br>  <br>  Esta técnica se realiza mediante la inyección de un colorante llamado fluorescencia, a través del torrente sanguíneo, luego se fotografía la retina en secuencias constantes, cuando el colorante pasa por los vasos de la retina. Pudiéndose apreciar las alteraciones de vascularización con mayor claridad<br>  <br>  <br>  · Tratamiento<br>  <br>  Como se desconocen las causas, el tratamiento es poco efectivo. Se suelen dar suplementos nutricionales de vitaminas y Zinc.<br>  <br>  Si los vasos afectados no están en la mácula se realiza una coagulación mediante láser para evitar que el acumulo de vasos alterados produzcan nuevas hemorragias, en el caso de degeneración macular húmeda.<br>  <br>  El control periódico del fondo puede prevenir la aparición de algunas formas de degeneración macular.

63cOspFhaa	Usually its an intolerance to something that causes stomach aches. What kind of stomach ache is it? Its a a dull ache, a sharp pain, or like a stich kind of pain? As a teen, I used to have constant, debilitating stomach aches, which we found out later was in intolerance to white, refined flour. Is there something you eat regularly that can be causing it? I doubt its swine flu. Growing pains could also be a factor. If they keep going on, you should consult your doctor, he can help you figure out what it is, and what you can do about it : )

dpgXzMenaa	There's no "let me" about it... it's *your* body and comfort involved here, not hers, and you can do whatever you feel is best.<br>  <br>  The ones with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert. If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|0lnamekJaa	Just go to a walgreens or grocery store and buy them yourself. <br>  <br>  It is silly that she won't let you use tampons...

Just try and be honest with her and be mature about it and maybe she will get them for you.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, it's YOUR body and YOU are the one who wants to use them. So you could go to the store (if you have a way to get there) and buy them yourself if you want<br>  <br>  good luck =)|`|Shrpnpwqaa	You're my age. :D<br>  I started using them on my 3rd period. (about a year ago)<br>  But I don't use them everyday. I use them on my heaviest days (2nd-4th) so that I don't feel all gross sitting in a pad. I like them better.<br>  My mom was worried about me using them too so she asked my doctor and my doctor said it would be okay as long as i remember to change them. Maybe next time you go to the doctor, ask your doctor if it'll be alright. And that might convince your mom. :D|`|EgoGwz4paa	i was 14 wen i started using them. i suggest saving up some money and buying them urself. she will come around eventually. tell her its very uncomfortable dancing with pads and that times r different frm when she was younger. jus hang in there. Tampons r good!! make sure u change them evry 4-6 hrs. U could also make her a list/chart of the pros and cons of tampons!!<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  p.s. if u were my daughter, i would definitely let u use them :)

HcS8vzNCaa	Food provides energy before you exercise, and provides the raw material for recovery after you exercise, so of course you should eat both before and after exercising.<br>  <br>  It is not a good idea to go into any sustained exercise activity on a full stomach.  Doing so may make you feel nauseous or may give you a stomach ache.  Exercise physiologists recommend eating about one to four hours before such a session, depending on your own digestive capacity and your own feelings.  <br>  <br>  Go for foods that are high in carbohydrates and easily digestible for your pre-exercise meal.   Pasta, fruits, breads, energy bars and drinks are all good.  Meat takes too long to digest, so it is better to eat this some other time. <br>  <br>  After you exercise, you first need to replace lost fluids.  Weigh yourself before and after you work out.  For every pound lost, you need to drink 20-24 ounces of water.<br>  <br>  Eat some fruit or juice about 15 minutes after exercising to help restore glycogen.  <br>  <br>  Then, for you post-exercise meal, an hour or two after your session, exercise physiologists recommend a meal with a 4:1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein  One study found that athletes who refueled with carbohydrate and protein had 100 percent greater muscle glycogen stores than those who only ate carbohydrate.<br>  <br>  Eating too close to going to bed can disrupt your sleep, so you should avoid it.  The general professional consensus on this is to not eat for a couple of hours or so before going to bed.<br>  <br>  I hope you enjoy your activity of choice and that you don't forget to eat both before and after your workouts.|`|LJf5rklZaa	both.  before and after.  a small snack like a banana and a piece of bread with a protein shake before and after a protein shake and then your dinner.  depending on what time you go to bed i wouldnt eat past 8 or so....unless you are working out that late.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Two hours minimum to allow your body to digest properly. Going to sleep on a 'heavy' stomach is not a good idea.|`|KVrEhZjtaa	You wanna exercise at least a half hour BEFORE you exercise.<br>  Otherwise you'll feel like you wanna throw up.<br>  And you wanna make sure your done eating TWO hours before bed.

T1xWH9yLaa	Acrocyanosis is a persistent, painless, symmetric cyanosis (lack of oxygen) of the hands, and sometimes the feet.  It is caused by vasospasm of the small vessels of the skin.  The cause is unknown, but may be related to increased tone of the small vessels associated with dilation of the vessels.  The fingers and toes are always cold to the touch and bluish to purple in color.  The disorder occurs in women of any age and not associated with a disease process.  Symptoms include cold fingers and toes, sweating profusely and may swell.  Cyanosis (color) may intensify in the cold weather and lessen with warming.  Except for reassurance and protection from cold, treatment is usually unnecessary.  Vasodilators are usually ineffective.  Only a licensed doctor can make this diagnosis. you should definitely be seen by a doctor <br>  Certified Medical Assistant|`|fdNo9Flbaa	Sometimes this is a sign of congestive heart failure or a circulatory disease.

ysUqQ9Qkaa	Actually, contrary to what the other poster on this thread said, adderall is not a depressant.  If it calms you down that's because you have a chemical imbalance that adderall correct.  Adderall is basically an amphetamine, which means it's a stimulant.  Monster energy drink contains high amounts of caffeine also a stimulant.  You probably just set your heart racing.  Probably no big deal but you should ask your doctor if this is a sign that you should curb your caffeine intake.|`|TXCDvf49aa	The reason you're feeling dizzy is that both things you consumed are pretty strong stimulants. The caffeine in the energy drink, when combined with the Adderal and the adrenaline from being at the game probably just overheated your body a little. Sip some water and take it easy. You'll be fine.|`|86a545b35caa16b409a8e47f9f7218abaa	Adderall is a stimulate itself and combined with that much sugar, caffeine, an guarana, can be dangerous.

SB4N01OOaa	That's a very broad question...it depends on why you're going to see him or her.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  You should make sure you tell the endocrinologist all of your symptoms and leave nothing out. Endocrinologists are doctors that specialize in the endocrine system, which is basically the body system responsible for the management of hormones. <br>  <br>  You should ask the doctor any questions you have about the thyroid-what it does, how thyroid hormone affects your body, and what happens if you have too much or too little thyroid hormone.<br>  <br>  Also, ask any and all other questions you may have, because that's what the doctor's there for! Get as much information out of him/her as you can. If he/she can't answer something for you, ask for a referral to someone who can. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	Ask what you HBA1C is. He'll be impressed. It's the average amount of sugar in your blood. I have type one diabetes and for me the 6's are good because I'm thirteen but that might be different for you. Also, you don't want to be in the 8's and up. Now he will have to prick your finger (shouldn't hurt to bad) and then ask. For example if it comes back 7.2, that means 7.2 percent of your blood is sugar. 7.2 is fairly good. Hope I helped!!|`|WadzK6ejaa	Whats your problem that makes you visit endocrinologist?|`|06kdiOVOaa	I believe you can choose them as "best answer" and select how many stars they should get from there.<br>  You might want to ask what kinds of nutrients you should focus on getting--specific stuff you should really focus on trying to get down. Or if they think you should take a certain supplement. Endocrinologists focus on making sure that your pancreatic system is working right, so a big component of that is blood sugar. Since you may not be getting enough or the right kinds of nutrients, this could effect your blood sugars. Which could be bad. You might also ask why, if you have an eating disorder, the doc recommended you see an endocrinologist. Ask as much as you want. That's what they're there for! Good luck!

You should lose at least 20 pounds to get to a healthy BMI. <br>  <br>  It's quite simple to do. Eat less and exercise more. Go for a walk for half an hour every day. (It doesn't count if you walk to Starbuck's for a huge latte, though. Make sure half of everything that you eat is produce (fruits, veggies). Eat at least one serving of dark leafy greens a day (kale, spinach, chard, beet greens, etc) and get some bright orange stuff, too. Then get some protein. If you eat meat, keep it lean and try to eat more fish than mammal. If you don't, be careful not to eat too many eggs. Have three servings of low-fat (or non-fat) dairy or dairy alternative a day. Take it easy on the carbs and get most of them from whole grains (rather than processed grains or starchy vegetables). <br>  <br>  Then cut soda and juice cocktails. Stick to skim milk, water, and maybe a little bit of juice or a juice spritzer now and then.|`|UxL9QufRaa	Hey here to help. I personally do not think you are fat.

It's called "discharge".  You may or may not start your period soon.  Buy panty liners in the feminine isle and wear them daily.  This will keep your underwear clean.

If so, Monistat, Vagistat, or Gynelotrimen will stop it. You can get those at the grocery store, drug store, even Target or Wal-mart.<br>  <br>  If you have started your period already it's most likely a natural part of your cycle. You will have heavier discharge around the time your period approaches. The only thing you can do is wear one of those thin panty liners.<br>  <br>  If you haven't started your period, you're probably about to. Gather your supplies (pads, tampons) and get ready.<br>  <br>  Good luck sugarplum!

1thzSbS8aa	Yes, this is very common. Wish I had a dollar for every time I've seen a 13-year-old ask whether she could get pregnant from swimming in a public pool, or from using the toilet after her brother. :D<br>  <br>  But you're a little older and seem more knowledgeable than those girls. You KNOW some of your thoughts are irrational, but do you know why they're irrational?  For instance, your example of the towel. Sperm cells are very impressive little critters, but they can't survive in a dry state on a towel, to impregnate the next unsuspecting female who uses the towel.  If they could survive on surfaces, and be successfully transferred to hands and other body parts, they'd be germs, not sperms. <br>  <br>  Sperm are extremely sensitive to temperature and PH. They can live 3-5 days inside the uterus. If they're not inside the uterus, they have a few minutes to a few hours at most. They only live SECONDS in water, which is why no girl gets pregnant in the pool unless she actually had sex in the pool.<br>  <br>  It's actually difficult enough to get pregnant on purpose even with millions of sperm cells. Chances are never greater than 25% even with perfect timing. So imagine the odds against getting pregnant by accident with one stray sperm cell. They probably couldn't even make that happen in a lab, not if they tried for years.|`|B7QwhrCmaa	i feel the same some times.

I knew it was irrational, but it still scared me to death.<br>  <br>  Now that I'm sexually active it's even worse. Although I love my boyfriend, I cannot help but be terrified of the possibility of pregnancy.<br>  I'm deathly afraid of becoming pregnant to the point of overdosing on abortifacients when my period is a day or two late.<br>  I even sometimes get symptoms of pregnancy just because I'm freaking out about it.<br>  I get sweaty palms, rapid heart palpitations and headaches when I think about the possibility of being pregnant and just looking at pregnant women makes me feel ill.<br>  I think about it all the time when my period is late. I can't do work or focus on anything, I just focus on my fear.<br>  <br>  I really wish I could tell you what to do, but I honestly can't.<br>  Go talk to a counselor or psychiatrist about your fears, that's what I'm going to do.|`|iM1j8I9Haa	Stress will cause your period to be late or early or not come at all.  The only way you can get pregnant without having sex is if you and a guy are together naked and he has his penis near enough to your vagina to touch it.  The pre-*** that he produces has more sperm than an actual ejaculation.  If that touches you, it can get you pregnant.<br>  If your not even fooling around with a man than you just need to relax & realize that motherhood is not in your near future.  Enjoy being young & educated and that you don't have to worry about getting pregnant because your making a smart decision not to have sex. :)|`|lYzSiEsnaa	Hahaha... I think every girl goes through that... like umm did I ******* sit on something while in a bathing suit (cause sperm can survive outside the body for 2 days)... where the hell is my period?... Then you're all pissed thinking how unfair it would be to be pregnant without even doing the deed and how would you ever explain it to your parents... Then you get your period and you're like "Holy crap I'm psycho." ... But it doesn't help that there are all these cases of girls getting pregnant without having sex cause they were like making out with a guy, he got "excited", and sperm can travel when you're like rolling around on eachother... Uhh, not helping matters when I'm freaking out wondering where my period is and still a virgin... So yeah, you're totally not alone.|`|mNjWvMDHaa	I went through something very similar several years ago.  However, my "fear" was not of being pregnant but of having a terminal illness.  I went from doctor to doctor for many years thinking I had different types of cancer.  I was embarrassed, depressed and under a ton of stress from school and raising my girls.  Eventually I saw a doctor that  encouraged me to seek professional counseling because I had nothing wrong with me physically.  It was that I was suffering from severe anxiety and depression.  It was the best advice I ever received.  I sought out a qualified psychologist and   explained to me that I had OCD - obsessive compulsive disorder which was causing the repetitive thoughts that led to my fear and depression.  She  prescribed me Zoloft which is an SSRI.  My life is wonderful and I no longer have those obsessive fears and thoughts.  I see her maybe every 6-7 months for about 30 minutes unless I feel I need more.  I finished school, work as a nurse, am married and raising my two girls.  I would really suggest to you that if you continue to have these thoughts or they go away and new thoughts or odd habits begin, that you seek a qualified professional.  Medication is not the only answer.  There a lot of therapeutic  techniques that really can help you also.  Remember though to finish school.  It is the key to opening sooooooooo many doors and will allow you a much easier life in the future.  Good luck and keep us updated.  P.S.  I have two girls and THEY WERE NOT FROM IMMACULATE CONCEPTION!!!!!  It just doesn't happen.|`|Iu0AJDviaa	Buy a book-How did i get here.
X6A6RpNlaa	Girl, I can completely sympathize with you. I am 19 and in college, taking on a full load class schedule and working hard towards medical school. The pressure is on, and I bet you know what that feels like because you work hard too, apparently. I commend your work ethic because being in college AND working is not an easy thing.<br>  <br>  Therefore, you could consider the following things as causes of your symptoms: PMS, depression, or just plain old troublesome STRESS!<br>  <br>  Sometimes when I am PMS-ing, I feel a general tiredness for days, and I get teary at random moments. Many women get this way too a few days before their periods.<br>  <br>  Or, you might be depressed. Have you tried talking out your feelings with someone trustworthy? Your mom or a close friend could be a good person to start talking to. Sometimes talking it out can relieve your burdens.<br>  <br>  STRESS... an evil all on its own! I can't tell you how many times I have messed up my menstrual cycle because I was over-stressed... whether it was school, work, family, or some combination of things. Make time for yourself to relax. Take 1 hour out of every day to do something you LIKE to do... not homework, not working, not "keeping busy," but something enjoyable. Make time for YOU because that is always important.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, ask someone you love and trust to go with you to your doctor. S/he can then check your symptoms and give you a proper diagnosis and maybe some peace of mind.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped. Take good care, and good luck!|`|iM1j8I9Haa	First of all, are you sexually active?  If so, are you having a period?<br>  You might consider getting a pregnancy test if the first answer is yes and the second answer is no.<br>  <br>  Secondly you may have developed mild depression.  This can happen even if there are no major traumas in your life.  <br>  <br>  You may also want to have a sleep study done at the local hospital.  Many people don't sleep well and after months and months your body can react.  If you wake up a lot during the night or don't feel rested first thing in the morning these are definitely signs of not getting enough sleep.  Also, do you feel like you need to go back to bed withing an hour so of waking up?  If any of these is a yes...have a sleep study done.|`|5je73V2Taa	go to freemd.com<br>  it's a virtual doctor website.<br>  a little cheesy i know, but most of the time, the doctor has been right on the mark with my health issues. <br>  feel better :)|`|Oy5nMZ0xaa	i have all of those and i have for like a year... im 14 so idk when u know let me know!|`|ny4qkoifaa	It may be depression.

WqdmDiQaaa	Sounds like you may be in a depression, you may be overwhelmed and just not know it, sometimes it just happens.

Scoliosis is a lateral (side-to-side) curve in the spine, usually combined with a rotation of the vertebrae. (The lateral curvature of scoliosis should not be confused with the normal set of front-to-back spinal curves visible from the side.) While a small degree of lateral curvature does not cause any medical problems, larger curves can cause postural imbalance and lead to muscle fatigue and pain. More severe scoliosis can interfere with breathing and lead to arthritis of the spine (spondylosis).<br>  <br>  Levoscoliosis means: A curve in the spine that points to the left.  This does not usually cause pain.<br>  <br>  L = Lumbar and T= Thorac region of your back. Basically you have a abnormal curvature in the spine.

hXYjkCGpaa	Teeth whitening methods range from the products for at-home use, such as toothpaste, strips, and even gel trays, to in-office treatments applied by dentists. They differ greatly in price, and also in effectiveness. In making a decision you should also consider the level of discoloration of your teeth. Care must be exercised to prevent damage to the teeth enamel. I suggest you read up a bit more and compare the different systems before making a decision.

4bj86Z0eaa	here are some possible causes:<br>  -one of the effects of anorexia is dehydration, because you often do not get enough water when on a starvation diet (you usually get some water through food, so without this water, your body becomes dehydrated) and when you begin to eat again, your body retains some of the water.  since you only gained 1/4 pound, it's probably just water weight<br>  -weight of food in your stomach: now that you're eating again, there's probably still some food sitting in your stomach that your body hasn't processed and digested yet.  also, depending on how long you've been recovering, your digestive tract will be really slow.  when you starve your body, you effect your digestive tract and your body may burn some of the muscles that help digestion to provide energy to you when you were starving.  now, your body still needs to rebuild those muscles and this is making it difficult for your body to push that food out of your system<br>  -inaccurate scale<br>  -increase in muscle mass: when you're starving, your body uses muscle for energy, and now that you're giving it food again, it is able to rebuild that muscle by converting some fat into muscle.  Muscle weighs more than fat, so this could have caused a slight weight gain.<br>  -slow metabolism: when you put your body in starvation mode, it slows your metabolism to conserve energy.  right now, your metabolism is still relatively slow, but the more food you give it, the more your body will be able to increase its metabolism.  if you continue with recovery, your metabolism will get better<br>  <br>  However, now that you're in recovery, I don't think that it's worth obsessing about a 1/4 pound.  In recovery, you'll need to gain a lot more than that to return to a healthy weight, and if you really want to get better, you can't obsess about your weight.  i wish you the best of luck in recovery, and i hope that some of these explanations made sense to you|`|rg5uS4aFaa	You need to quit worrying so much about your weight and start concentrating on your health.If you don't stop worrying about the weight you'll go back to your old habits which are Extremely unhealthy and will eventually kill you.

pU4vXbwVaa	A close personal friend of mine is also taking Zoloft for chemical imbalances. It has been going on for about 6 months and this person just stopped having bouts of depression a couple of weeks ago. They still have them, but it's more rare and not as bad. Of course my friends and yours situations are likely very different.<br>  <br>  In 4-6 weeks. the symptoms merely improve. You won't be back to normal for a couple more months.<br>  Talk to your doctor and ask if you qualify for therapy treatment as well.

They sort of go hand in hand.|`|JBugDqvraa	tut...I was gonna say all that! good answer above :-)|`|12oIRG4Paa	As long as you are noticing some improvement, that's a good sign. It's different for every person.<br>  Give your new dose a month or so and see how it goes. Discuss any symptoms/problems you are still having with your doctor at that point. You may need a higher dose or the addition of another med to put your depression into full remission.
bqkfu6Diaa	Protein itself will not likely make you fat. It is essential for muscle growth though. If you are concerned about gaining body fat from protein bars, you should consider the carb and fat contents in the bars you choose as well as the number of calories.<br>  <br>  A common mistake made by many people trying to build muscle or eat healthier is consuming too much protein. Your body can only process so much protein a day. Even if you are lifting weights and building muscle, the increase of protein in your diet should only be a small amount. Most of the protein consumed in all these expensive protein shakes is extra food that your body does not need. It causes strain on your kidneys and causes your body to produce excess amounts of nitrogen in your urinary tract. Think of it like adding sand to a water pipe system. If you add too much, it turns to sludge, moves slowly, and may even clog. If you add more water per amount of sand, more sand can be pumped through the system. So what you want to do when you drastically increase your protein intake is to also increase the amount of water you drink. This will help flush out your system more effectively and put less strain on your kidneys.|`|r0AWokHLaa	eating lots of protein will make you gain lean mass but protein bars are going to make you gain a little bit of fat also  since they are high in carbs, calories, and sugars.

How heavy are you?  When I hear a young teen concerned about weight, especially a female, I am concerned.  <br>  <br>  I don't believe in dieting.  I believe in eating healthy and exercise.  What I mean by that is that weight is controlled by how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you use up.  The amount of calories you use up is determined by 1) how much you exercise and 2) (to a lesser extent) your body's chemistry which is controlled by glands and the brain.  This is influenced by what you eat, how much you exercise, your age, and your genetics.  If you have a weight problem at your age, it is almost garunteed that it is due to poor eating habits and lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  The good news is that no matter what is causing you to be heavier than you want, diet and exercise will fix it.  That means you are in charge!  The bad news is you have to take charge and use self control.<br>  <br>  First thing's first, schedule a doctor's appointment and while you wait for your appointment, write down everything you eat.  Also record all of your physical activity, and how much you sleep. When you see the doctor ask how to lose weight and ask why you are heavy.<br>  <br>  Here's some stuff you need to know: <br>  <br>  1) Anyone can lose weight.  There aren't any heavy people in parts of the world where people are starving.  I know that sounds rude but it's true.  And it means that you can lose weight, too, no matter what.<br>  2) there are 3 basic sources of calories: fat, carbs, and protein.  All the rest are sub-categories.<br>  3) fiber is good<br>  4) eat a balanced diet.  Too much fat and carbs will make you heavy.  Too much protein can be just as harmful.  If you eat well you will feel well and you will be able to exercise more.  Never eat less than 1600 calories a day.  <br>  5) if you exercise off more calories than you eat, you will lose weight.  Be careful that you don't exercise so hard that it makes you quit, though.<br>  6) you put the weight on slow, expect it to come off slow.  If you get discouraged today then make up for it tommorrow.  Remember excuses don't erase pounds.  If you need encouragement, ask us for some here on yahoo answers.<br>  7) the best exercise routine is the one you will use.  That means that if you make an exercise routine that is so tough that it is hard to do, you might quit.  Know yourself and make a routine that is easy to follow.  Try sports!<br>  <br>  Try at P.E. if your school offers it.  Kids don't actually make fun of people that try hard in P.E.  what have you got to lose besides the weight?  If not in P.E., exercise at home, try aerobics, pilates, piyo, or just dancing. Ask your parents to take you to the YMCA or a gym, get dance dance revolution.  Ask yahoo answers for suggestions.  Or become a cyclist.  If you get a fast bike you will love going fast on it and you can burn a ton of calories that way.  And heavy people can cycle a lot easier than they can run.  Think about it, have you ever seen a heavy professional cyclist?  No!  My friend was 250 lbs. at 6 feet tall.  He started cycling and now he's muscular, thin, and got 5th for his age group in one of the biggest races in the country!  He ate nothing but junkfood and rode his racing bike to work and back (12 miles away) every day. for 6 months. That's all he did!  Now he looks like a model.<br>  <br>  Don't eat junkfood if you can avoid it.  Now matter how much you exercise junkfood is still bad for your body in a lot of ways.  Watch a movie called supersize me to learn a lot more.  It's a funny documentary about a guy who ate mcdonalds for 30 days straight.  <br>  <br>  If you sweat a lot you want to drink some gatorade.  If not, then drink water.  Don't drink too much water if you are sweating a lot.  You will water down your blood and you will sweat out your salt.  If you get low enough on salt you can pass out and even die.  Some athletes have died like this.  <br>  <br>  start out with little workouts and little changes in your eating habits.  Avoid fried food, creamy fatty mayonaise based sauces, greasy food, and sugar.  You can drink half your day's calories in soda if you drink it at every meal.  Try water, diet rite soda, and anything with splenda in it.  Look up Splenda online to learn more.<br>  <br>  Here's a list of things that have no or low calories in them:<br>  tomatoes, onions, mustard, fruit, vegetables, mushrooms, chicken, turkey, and fish.  <br>  <br>  Don't feel like you can't eat bread or regular food.  Just try to avoid making it the main part of your diet.  A turkey sandwich with mustard, onion, some green leafy vegetables like lettuce or sprouts, and avocado is healthy.  Adding bacon and mayonaise is not so healthy.  1 sandwich is good.  4 sandwiches is bad.  You can eat healthy and get full enough while loosing weight!  Just don't stuff yourself.  If you eat a sandwich or something and are still hungry, try eating some zero calorie foods or drink a full glass of water.  Eating slowly makes you full faster.  Joining a support group can help.  Also, subscribe to the 24 hour fitness newsletter or other health newsletters.  Have fun getting healthy! We believe in you!|`|c76321266084987a357c357cc1676715aa	Well, seen as though your young- basically none. I understand the peer-pressure of school, but still.. Magazines for children your age should offer some help- but this wouldn't necessarily keep you to one specific routined diet. Speak to your parents/guardians about you not feeling happy with your body, they can probably offer some advice. A diet I would recommend would be:<br>  <br>  * Enjoy what food you eat, your metabolism slows down as you grow up.<br>  * Try to eat five portions of fruit & veg. a day.<br>  * Three portions of calcium intake a day- eg milk, cheese, yoghurt.<br>  * Don't snack on: crisps, chocolate, sweets etc. Save that for a treat to the cinemas with your friends at the weekend. But don't go over the top.<br>  * Ditch the diet of junk food (if thats what you eat). If you found out what they put it that stuff... ugh.<br>  * Join extra-curricular activities, like gym club or something- and stick to it.<br>  * Find a friend to speak/relate to when dieting.<br>  * NEVER EVER CRASH DIET. Develop your new diet bit by bit.<br>  * Swimming tones up the body more than any other sport. Go swimming as often as you want to. The pounds will literally drop off.<br>  * Don't drink fizzy pop. Drink smoothies or water. Water has no fat or calories in it.<br>  <br>  Still considering it? It will be hard work. But good luck!

I may have these mixed up, but I'm sure they are different molecules and they should show up differently on different tests.  The relative strenths of  the effects of the two are different, so they obviously react differently inside the body, and I imagine they will react differently in a drug-test

If it was bug cuaght from food poisoning it is less likely you'll pass it on.<br>  <br>  The best way of remaining hydrated if the diarrhoea is bad is dioralyte as mentioned above. If you baby gets diarrhoea, it is better to give them water with a few spoons of sugar dissolved in. If your child has D&V for more than 24 hours take them to see your GP as they can become dehydrated very quickly.

Due to the presence of a sizeable quantity of unsaponifiable fats, its content in vitamins and other active elements, shea butter adds other more precise activities to these general properties. It displays a protecting role against UV rays because of its content in cinnamic acid and can thus be incorporated in solar products. The natural latex contained in shea butter would moreover prevent certain sun allergies. Shea butter also helps cell regeneration and capillary circulation. This favours the healing of small wounds, skin cracks and crevices, and skin ulcers. In the cosmetic field, this property is an asset against skin aging. It has restructuring effects on the epidermis, also on dry and fragile hair. Dry skin, dermatitis, dermatoses, eczema, sun burn, and burns are all helped by natural shea butter. It has an anti-elastase characteristic which makes it a good active ingredient against stretch marks.<br>  <br>  Shea butter can also be used to treat rheumatism and aching muscles, and to ease colds because it decongests nasal mucous tissues. It is very well tolerated by the skin for it does not normally trigger any allergic reaction and can even be used on very sensitive skin areas such as mucous tissues and around the eyes.<br>  <br>  Shea butter is therefore an outstanding recipe for cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes, even incorporated in high proportions. It is easy to work into all kinds of emulsions and makes a very good excipient (carrier) as it prevents allergenic reactions without altering the active principles.|`|16acae3c399517bc69c6af75450afc13aa	African Shea butter is derived from the nut of the Karite tree.<br>  <br>  Shea butter is unique because of its high content of non-saponifiable fats which act as a natural skin moisturizer.

Remembering all the surface markers and their corresponding cells was really hard at first because of the screwy numbering system, and hands on practice really helps create a visual type of memorization.|`|03cee31ffadefa329e6e8d74f3d8621aaa	Since the immune system is about the body's responses after attacks by infections, maybe you could beg Mr. Hundley to give you the points needed for that part of the project without doing it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  it ownz
c222262ec43d3e2ededcf13c811e2412aa	I think so...ice cream and cake have a lot of fat and sugar in them|`|AA11118580	Probably because you are slowing your metabolism down by not eating until dinner time, and then eating stuff that is terrible for you.  That sounds about as unhealthy as you can get.|`|c0f46f82e2e9e94b7f54e6854e7c8b90aa	It takes 3500 extra calories to gain a pound.|`|1b7e2c56cac59173cea8fc520048de6aaa	nope...but you arnt eating healthy and that should concern you more than your weight does.|`|AA11426571	Gemma is right in that 3500 calories equals a pound, but since you didn't eat breakfast and lunch, your body kicks into "survival mode". It will not burn off anything because it's afraid there won't be anymore. Just like if you don't drink plenty of water, your body will instinctively retain all the water. The more of the right foods you eat, the more you'll lose because your metabolism will kick in continuously burning the fat. All you gave your body was sugar, which will turn to fat.|`|f01464a54d15679ef1b94510239cfecaaa	U wont gain weight but y did u skip breakfast?

AA10259009	It is a common misconception that oatmeal really helps to clear skin.  Kind of a funny one at that.  Can you just picture someone with their face covered in oatmeal?  It might help to maintain healthy skin, but it will definitely not clear up your acne.  A better solution I found can be found on my blog.  You might want to check it out.|`|AA10045887	Oatmeal is a good cleaning agent, but if you have ache, it's not going to help.

(For more information about the Ayurvedic doshas, see "All about Vata, Pitta and Kapha" on page 28.) To control acne, he suggests adopting a diet that includes plenty of bland foods such as oatmeal, applesauce and basmati rice and eliminates fried foods, spicy foods and citrus fruits.|`|3ee9ee38ecd34b1a8fa012b023279c21aa	well my brother used that and it did help not like tremendouslybut significantly yes.  you just make it like as if you were going to eat it and then you just put it on ur face. he used to keep it on for an hour.|`|5fae87d2099ca786e0dd691de6f9ceb6aa	Natural oatmeal is helpful for home solutions to treat acne. It is in fact wonderful for all skin irritations. Simply apply lukewarm or slightly cool cooked oatmeal to your face for 12 minutes and then wash it off completely. Natural oatmeal is an acne solution and also an astringent because it removes oil and impurities off of the skin, keeping skin clean and acne-free.
bw6xjvkYaa	Its a heel spur. I have one too. Get an appointment to go see a pediatrist. He/she, will probably fit you for orothotics and tape up your foot, neither of these hurt. If its a really intense heel spur then they may inject steriods to get the swelling down. Surgery is a last option, but its only reserved for those who  cant walk because of the spur.|`|6890ccdbaaeedf82d099d353b4b8b02caa	Sounds like a heel spur to me.  THis can sometimes be cause be calcuim deficiency.  Don't go barefoot - where sneakers or other soft soled shoes.  They can go away on their own.

You may need to have it surgically removed. This is considered to be an out patient surgery and you go in the hospital in hte morning and are out within a few hours. they will either do a spinal block where you will not feel anything  or a general where you are knocked out.<br>  Unfortunately you would not be able to put pressure on your foot what so ever but in the long run you will feel better.<br>  you might want to also ask about having special inserts made for you.,  the foot specialist does this as well.  and invest in a good pair of tennis shoes such as new balance.<br>  I hope this helps.  I would have this done as soon as possible if I were you, do not wait until it is too late...|`|a5652a628179ca4592ec44eed5cab808aa	You could a a heel spur, which is a small piece of bone growing from the bottom of your heel and very painful. the ganglion  cysts  are pretty common and can grow just about any where.

So far we're running neck in neck with the ailments! I know it hurts like mad, so take your Alleve and get better soon.

Best of luck :)|`|03ef6fe91f4317d6866654e918036e00aa	Depends on how much wieght you want to loose.  The best thing to do for 20 pounds or more is not diet or try to loose your weight fast or you skin will sag and it will be much worse than fat.  I just lost 51.2 pounds and that took me a year.  However I just ate health, counted calories(stay around 1200 to loose the weight then increase to 1400 to build the muscle and loose flab)and did 30 mins of aerobic exercise and 30 of toning.  You should work yourself up to these points.  Don't eat a lot of red meat, eat whole wheat pasta and bread but not too much.  Incorporate dairy into your diet, like yogurt and cheese and snack on nuts, dried fruit, fruit and things that arent processed.  That should get you started.|`|0lUDogkEaa	honestly the best sucess i have had was weight watchers. i lost an average of 2-4  pounds a week with out excersize.  pretty much its low calorie low fat and high fiber food, but on the diet you can eat what ever you want as long as you count your points. and a little secret you dont have to go to the meetings, just go for the first time and get all your stuff and you can do it yourself! in about a 2 month period i lost about 21 pounds|`|bAtfwdvtaa	Read tips & articles on different types of diets, exercise programs, yoga & much more....<br>  <br>  All about weight loss, weight watchers, Tea diets, easy home exercises to name a few|`|fLMYqwgiaa	If you want to try a premade plan I saw that <a href="http://www.diet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.diet.com/</a> has an offer for $100 NutriSystem for the next few days. My college roommate swears by it because she doesn't have to shop/cook and it's so cheap.
7b6dfe25effa5d1dd067f55c35d61913aa	There is a wonderful line of products called Arbonne that has really helped me in that area.  It is a little expensive when you first buy the whole set of products, but they all run out at different times so you don't have to buy them all at once again.  If you sign up as a distributor you can get yours cheaper.  You can order them online.<br>  <br>  I'm seriously not spamming, I just love the product.  It has made my skin feel completely different.|`|a635e8b1baca0004497233775c68fc33aa	Some lotions contain a high amount of water and you dont want to use those.

There are some moisturizers in it as well so as it takes off the dead skin it moisturizes it. In addition to using this 2 times a week you should invest in an exfoliating cloth.
mTSYemNgaa	Splenda kills the "friendly" bacteria in your intestines. If that happens, she will get really sick.|`|4IX4imDmaa	No, eating Splenda will not make you diabetic, if fact my husband's doctor recommended that he use Splenda because it is a healthy alternative to sugar (my husband is a diabetic).  <br>  <br>  Also, we talked to the doctor about all the rumors out there about the negative health effects of Splenda and he stated that they have all been proven to be false.
DAwEx4Egaa	You have tinnitus, and it's very common. So common, in fact, there's an organization devoted solely to this condition. Check out their website below. I have it too - have since I was very young - but I've just learned to live with it. It really only bothers me at night when it's very quiet. The website has lots of information on treatment options too.|`|pIgSS5Nqaa	Means you forgot to pick up the phone that's ringing right now.
ZDdUSL2Naa	Ok well, suicide is never the answer! As far as self harm goes, I know exactly what that feels like, as I used to do that too but came to realise that it never helped. However I know it is a kind of an addiction and it is quite hard to stop but you gotta think of yourself and its not good for you. <br>  Being a teenager sucks, I am really glad Im not one anymore- im 21 but I still get those feeling like I did back then. Bi-Polar is usually really serious and if you think you may have then you should definately go to your doctor where they can perscribe tablets to regulate your moods. If its just hormones then it sucks but you can still go to the doctor to find out how to make your moods better. Anti depressants are usually only a temporary solution and can sometimes make a person feel worse if the drug doesnt agree with them. <br>  I would also recommend going to see a counsellor to talk about your problems, even if you dont really know what they are and feel depressed for no reason, they can still help to work through what you are going through. I really hope you feel better soon and I hope you stop self harming cuz in the end you will realise it is pointless and then you are stuck with embarrassing nasty scars for life! Good luck! :)|`|6wKW0urqaa	see your GP. Talk to your doctor and they can let you know the difference and if you need to be on medication or if you need counselling. do it ASAP.|`|kpfMZ7Lyaa	You should talk to a counselor or doctor, it sounds like a lot is going on with you and it will help you to work through it with someone else.
8j7FCEOraa	That's normal, the mans penis hits your bladder when having sex.<br>  It might feel like you have to pee, but it very, very, very rarely happens when a woman actually pees during intercourse.<br>  <br>  I think your not having an orgasm because your worrying about it. Stress can easily hinder your efforts. Just relax, dont think about it, have no thoughts in your mind, dont analyze. Have lots of foreplay and focus on the feeling.|`|4WWVsABqaa	thats the beginning of an orgasm. you dont have to pee, its just because your being pleasured and your body doesnt know how to react. im fourteen and i know this stuff, now come on.|`|u8pdRkcZaa	There is nothing wrong with you.  I never had an orgasm until I met my husband.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you empty your bladder before you have sex, this may make that pressure feeling you are talking about go away.|`|MlojB0FWaa	dont know dont care :)|`|7sqpiGgoaa	have you taken the lid off?|`|i2QaFunfaa	jus releax a bit more|`|CODKbY6Jaa	I feel the same thing sometimes!

Why don't you just eat healthy food?  Junk is called that for a reason, it does nothing for you.|`|9VkET9jNaa	maybe at most 5 pounds.<br>  it's combination of diet AND exercise.<br>  <br>  but little easy at home exercises help a lot! <br>  <br>  good luck :D|`|pquw7AdQaa	you definitely should watch what you eat but remember to exercise!<br>  3500calories =1lb of fat!|`|2xTT414eaa	slowly, maybe but it's a lot more efficient if you eat healthier foods and exercise at least 3 times week for an hour.|`|dVJq7c8Vaa	thats like WW so i guess.. but you should eat atleast 1200 calories

xYTagSIyaa	A cut of this sort should have healed itself in a few days to a week, two weeks if you were a very slow healer.  You obviously have something else going on here.  I wonder if when you cut it you may have got a sliver in it or some sort of infection that did not heal properly.  I would have to suggest seeing your doctor about it.  If you have something in it, you may require minor surgery to have it cleaned out.  <br>  <br>  For a normal cut,(and you still try this if you like)  I would recommend putting about an ounce of salt in a small container, like an old margarine container and fill it with very warm water and soaking your finger in it until the water is cold, about 15-20 minutes once a day.  When it is out,  dry it thoroughly and put a broad spectrum antibiotic ointment on it like polysporin and cover it with a band-aid.  If there is no improvement you should see your doctor about it asap.  There are special band-aids for hard to bandage area's so use one that is appropriate for that area, if you are not sure, ask the pharmacist at your local drugstore, which band-aid and which antibiotic ointment is best.  <br>  <br>  I hope it works well for you.

Some people have reported diarrhea and vomiting associated with swine flu. Those symptoms can also be caused by many other conditions, and that means that you and your doctor can't know, just based on your symptoms, if you've got swine flu.

XSc1MDibaa	Okay basicly they are doing the same thing the state I live in did. Sending you to a psychiatrist and regular md instead of sending you to someone that can actully tell them something. You will have to apeal their desision. When I ended up doing it because they were sending me to the wrong doctors I just called a lawyer. Suddenly they sent me to the right kind of doctor. (I have vascular disease that has caused the aorta to my legs to close almost all the way off and cause it to be hard for me to even stand up/walk. It took me over 3 years to get on it even though I was on it and classified as disabled as a child.) If you do call a lawyer make sure it is one that only gets money if you get on the disability.|`|AA11484395	If you are suffering from these disabilities, then do what the state requires. They must diagnose the problem before they can bill the state to pay for it. Go see the psychiatrist and go see the MD. They will confirm your diagnosis and you should be able then to  file for help for with your disabilities.

ASAP, It very likely could be your kidneys, but it could also be other things. Its not something to fool around with, please seek help|`|asiYBKjmaa	This is a question you should be asking a doctor.   <br>  <br>  Plus, you know you aren't taking care of your body... is it any surprise that you might be experiencing side effects?

Qttp44G1aa	It actually sounds and looks like that your outer labia is just particularly long and the colors aren't unusual. Please check out the web site I sent, it gives a very accurate description of what vagina can look like, does it fit your description. If it doesn't ease your mind, please do see a dr. Gynecologist come in the female form also. But to reassure you many male Dr. have seen thousands of female anatomy, its really not a big issue with them, they just want to make sure you are well. Even if you aren't that close with your mom I'm sure she would be concerned and she probably could answer your questions. If it is your outer labia she probably has the same thing as sometimes these run in the family. So take courage and seek help.|`|V2nEmihVaa	well you have to hear what you need to hear and being a girl you have to get over the male doctor. that is his prfession and has seen every other vagina in the world. and if might have a disease you have to go in before it gets worse and something bad happens to you. get your head out of your *** and take care of yourself properly dumbass.|`|4pCGyjbNaa	from the look of that pic i can tell u r really scared..........actually its the first i am hearing of the condition and yes am going to tell you go see a doc or a gyno ok u really need to know whats going on with u|`|AtM6EGOUaa	it looks like it could be your labia because some women have bigger ones then others..but to be on the safe side i would see a doctor|`|VWqvskk3aa	who cares if hes male? you need to see a doctor. that osunds really serious|`|utY5px8Kaa	go to the doctor to make sure its nothing|`|jpqSnCpuaa	I honestly have no idea what it may be.  You can consider going to a local health department and see a doctor or nurse practicioner there.  They will not judge you and they will NOT tell your parents because it is against the law.  I wish you the best of luck!|`|JazebGv9aa	if i understand your drawing it looks like something on your inner labia. I would go to a gyno(they can be male or female). It sounds serious and your health is important. I really think you should see a doctor asap. Tell your mom you have something going on down there that is freaking you out and you want to see a gynocologist. If you go to the doctor and something is wrong your mom is going to need to know what is going on anyway. Good luck.

AA11024590	You didn't say if you had insurance (I guess not, or else you wouldn't be looking to pay it yourself). You can contact the respective Pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the drugs you need. They usually have programs to help people in need of their drugs but unable to pay for. You can also buy generic drugs if they exist instead of brand, it is cheaper and often works just as well. Or get equivalent drugs, not the same but which does the same thing. Try applying for Medicaid or Medicare to see if they help with anything. Hook up with Clinical Trials centers for HIV and you may benefit from new and upcoming drugs that also may work, usually free of charge.|`|gz6IKATOaa	you (i mean your friend) should go to the doctors to get more info. im sure there is assistance for your needs or i mean your friends needs. or look up on line|`|rnocHc8caa	Clueless|`|2f7214f6ad7889e2dcde8b7609919286aa	Please talk with your doctor or pharmacist they can submit a form for you requesting free or heavily discounted drugs.

You need to work your abdominal muscles. this invloves straining the muscles in your stomach area. A simple method to do this is by using a form of excercise called "The Plank" on which you lie on your back, and raise your feet (nothing else) off the ground, until your abdominal muscles (stomach) feels strained. Do this a couple of times a dat, and your abdominal muscles will quickly become more pronounced! Giving you that six pack!<br>  <br>  Also, if you are not as slim as you should be, you will need to go on a diet to slim your stomach down, to allow the muscles to show through.

Increasing your intake of water will not help because it is stored within your cells and makes you appear bigger but you should still aim to drink 4l a day. Remember to really concentrate on the muscle you are trying to work when training it and you will suceed!<br>  |`|z3Cr54rVaa	To get a toned six-pack, you need to get rid of that layer of belly fat as well as properly strengthening your ab muscles.<br>  <br>  So, once you get rid of the belly fat, you'll "reveal" a defined six-pack.<br>  <br>  Here's a good site I found with great diet and workout tips to tone your abs.

6e8a2562119ae10db7789da7710dfe93aa	I hope the page at the link below will explain what can be kind of complicated. The good news is that, while it won't actually be exterminated, in most cases, your immune system will suppress the virus within two years at the outside. <br>  <br>  Some strains cause genital warts. Some cause cervical cancer by causing changes in the cervical cells before the immune system can suppress them- and suppression is not 100% guaranteed 100% of the time, even for the wart causing strains.<br>  <br>   You can have more than one strain, so Pap tests as often as recommended by your doctor ( tell him/her of any history of cancer in your family too) are essential. <br>  <br>  And BTW, form the link below: "Risk of transmitting HPV to a baby during birth is low. In those rare cases, the baby can develop warts on her or his voicebox. There is no apparent link between HPV and miscarriage, premature births or other pregnancy related problems.

CHiEKZrLaa	"Type 2" Diabetes can be extremely effectively managed with exercise and good nutrition/dietary choices.  The really excellent news is that exercise and good nutrition will ALSO have a tremendous positive impact on how you handle the other issues you described.  You can totally do this!  Change can be challenging (especially if you're an "emotional eater.")  But once you establish a good habits and a routine you will probably find that you feel better than ever!<br>  <br>  When you get your blood test results, first remind yourself that this is in no way a "life sentence."  Literally with ~4 weeks of changes to your diet and lifestyle, you can reverse a Diabetes 2 diagnosis.  (Length of time it takes to reverse the diagnosis depends on how long your blood sugar control has been suboptimal and how severe it is.)<br>  <br>  And talk to your doc about getting some support...  a nutritional coach, a counselor, or even occasional visits with the doc/a nurse in her office can be helpful to get you through a difficult time.<br>  <br>  You've obviously survived a lot in your lifetime.  It takes an incredibly strong individual to get through the challenges you've described and still be breathing in and out.  You are still breathing!<br>  <br>  By definition, that makes you an incredibly strong individual.

You are average it will probably get bigger.|`|nhLvrVx9aa	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>  <br>  LOL....nice answer!!!<br>  <br>  Well is it 5 inches or 6 inches?<br>  But anywhere in between there is perfect.<br>  <br>  If your 15 and already that big, good for you! Your above the curve for sure!<br>  <br>  Be safe!|`|a1YedErQaa	Yeah it's a normal size, you're already past the g-spot with that =P|`|bTPvHB4Zaa	i am 13 and my is 4 inches so ya i guess it is|`|AA10389562	Normal is somewhere between<br>  <br>  "Awww, it's so cute"<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  "OMFG, is that real?"|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  The average penis size is about 6.5 inches when erect. But you are only 15, it will probably grow more.<br>  <br>  ~Mystic.
gx8CrCARaa	well i don't think that it is the tablets that he's taking it sounds more to me like he has poor circulation. it is something you might want to get looked at if that's the case!|`|Deb4iqbvaa	I'd say it is from a lack of blood flow. He should call his Doctor. My Granddad had discolorations in his foot too, he was also a Diabetic.|`|ulxe0jPZaa	Circulation problem ??  Diabetics are known to have poor circulation and vision problems as the disease progresses|`|QnB84dZQaa	Poor circulation.|`|2OdtNo9kaa	Trench Foot|`|AA10628838	Diabetics have problems with circulation. He needs to go and see his doctor immediately.|`|GoWPQvgHaa	It could be that he has little or no circulation to his toes.|`|fTaxoSPEaa	Maybe, the blood is not getting to his toes. But you should get him to a doctor, because if there isn't no blood they could cut him off. (sorry for my english but i am not a native speaker.)|`|a7ynfmhoaa	It probably is due to diabetes & circulation issues - he should see his doctor.|`|yKZQoLDoaa	is he alive??|`|BXgfLFVyaa	his feet are cold.. give him socks for christ sake
170GrvE0aa	Good prices: www.optical4less.com<br>  Reliable: Optical4less.com<br>  <br>  This company do sell contact lenses but are more reputable for their eyeglasses but regardless, their service is superior for everything they sell. I personally have bought many eyeglasses from them but not contact lenses yet. And each time they satisfy me, they are really an honest company. Enjoy them!|`|62X7JGBdaa	I get mine from 1800contacts.com|`|AA11925187	Lens.com is also a great site
dcf3258cb1b693d0dd6c21d1eb1934ffaa	idk about the rest but the IVR on the echo is measured from .6 to 1.1 and if it is 1.1 thats normal. did you do a 2d echo?|`|AA12317425	Ok first off take a deep breath and relax.  The septal thickness that you reported is completely within the normal range for the septum.  In a normal adult individual septal thickness ranges from 6mm to 11mm (0.6cm to 1.1cm).  8mm or 0.8cm is a perfectly normal thickness.
HBx6q05Oaa	First, apply direct pressure to the cut and hold it over your head for five minutes. Dont remove the napkin to see if it's quit as this removes the forming clot. After fifteen minutes, dampen the napkin and try and gently remove it from the cut. If you can see inside your finger, it probably needs a stitch and you may need a tetanus shot|`|hzZ3A7uQaa	it should be at least half a inch deep to get stiches.  Put presure on the cut for five min.  it may hurt like crap, but it will stop the bleeding.  if it hasent quit bleeding after that, have your doctor look at it.|`|GTqqz7kPaa	they do say that if a cut bleeds an un-usual amount for the depth of your cut then you need to get your blood tested, because you may a problem with your blood (the lack of clotting) but if you just apply pressure and hold it in a towel away from the blood stream of your heart (above your head) you should be just fine.|`|0LxgeSJnaa	You need to get about 2 paper towels, fold them up and put lots of pressure on ur finger.    if it is that deep you might need to go to the ER to get some stitches.     I would see if putting pressure on it stops it first.     if it doesnt then i would call ur dad again and tell him its still bleeding.
0395026ebd35850e7b778382fd5ed61faa	you can:<br>  <br>   just get a chewing gum and it will make your body think that you have ate something <br>  <br>  try and do something which will stop you being bored<br>  <br>  i know this sounds silly but have an ice cube ciz u can trick your body <br>  <br>  everytime your hungry get a piece of fruit<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|x5ftqjo5aa	i'm bulimic, so really, i shouldn't be giving anyone diet advice at all, but one summer, i totally stopped my habit by eating snacks every 3 hours. The calorie total usually came in under 1000, so it wasn't really too healthy, but it did help me from bingeing and purging.|`|FgMkYu5Baa	Eat protein rich foods and also foods with alot of fiber. These will keep you feeling full longer and will help with the cravings.|`|6NZeItMAaa	One reason why most diets fail is because we are used to have some foods that fulfill our needs for sweet. First of these foods is often chocolate. Chocolate fights depression and give us a peaceful sensation almost immediately. It’s rich in minerals and vitamins but very caloric. The chocolate diet includes some controlled absorptions during the day that will help you to have that delicious feeling and lose weight at the same time.<br>  <br>  There is no question here of taking chocolate, pasta and pop corns every day but of healthy balanced menus for two weeks containing an unstopping variety of foods: dairy products, fruits and vegetables, starchy foods, meat and fish, etc.<br>  <br>  The principle is to play on the light but by agreeing chocolate and a small pleasure sometimes to hold over the duration and not to feel frustrations. It promises between 2 and 6 pounds a week according to the weight to lose.<br>  <br>  The chocolate diet can be followed by everybody because it has been studied by a nutritionist to bring to our bodies all the nutrients that we need.|`|KDUwFiBPaa	Eat small, healthy meals/snacks every couple hours so you don't only eat when you're starving.  It's easier to resist temptations when your body isn't begging for food.  Eat fiber rich foods and snack on veggies/fruits.  And I think of all the bad food I crave as how much time on a treadmill of elipitical I'd have to spend in order to work it off.  That usually helps me reach for an apple or salad rather than candy bar or burger.
tBF9VfPqaa	1. Big deep breaths through your nose. Lean your head as far down to your chest as possible.    2. Try and stay as calm as possible... and do not try and grab the assistants hands, the impression may move and you will have to do it over.    You can ask them if they have any topic numbing solution that you can have just rubbed on the roof of your mouth. If they have it, you can swallow a little and it will help numb the back of your throat as well. Since it is just a rub, it will only last for about 15 minutes.    Tell the doctor/asst that you gag easily and see if they have any other suggestions. Also, make sure that they give you bowl in case you do drool or start gagging so you do not get anything on your clothes.    Good luck to you!!!|`|39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	Nope. You'll have to have an impression. Let them know before they take it that you are a gagger. They may adjust the consistency or placement of the material in the tray so that it's less likely to go down your throat. Most places use stuff that sets within 30 seconds so just try to concentrate on something else. Lean forward a little and breathe through your nose (and wiggle your toes) and focus on another spot in the room and soon it will be over with. Don't try to pull it out before it's set and try to control the gagging as much as possible... otherwise they may have to do it AGAIN.
kqkgro5Zaa	use white out, it shouldn't soak through the cast (not sure if anything can go through a cast that's liquid) and then just write a whole bunch of stuff over the white out.......it might look weird but i guess it's better than nothing right?
cB2VGhLgaa	It's funny that I came across ur question, I'm 15 and I have a problem w/ anxiety too. Little things that other people wouldn't think twice about have me worrying for days sometimes. I finally said enough is enough and tried to stop getting so obsessed and worried about everything. When I'm in a stressful situation or when something happens that I know will really bug me, I just have to tell myself to relax and think about things logically. I examine whatever is bothering me and try to get to the root of the problem. I try to forget about my feelings on whatever happened and sometimes thats all it takes. I kind of begin to realize that whatever happened that I was freaking out over is so small and irrelevant and not something I have to worry about. <br>  Idk if that will help you but just tell yourself to relax whenever you get really worried and stressed out.|`|AA10096832	I think this is totally normal. For one, teenage years are difficult. You are making huge leaps and strides away from being a child to being an adult and this is hard emotionally, socially, and physically. So I wouldn't think that there is something overly wrong with your anxiety level at this point. You are learning how to do something you've never had to do before -- in this case, how to deal with a new job. (Which is usually not easy, by the way!)<br>  <br>  I really think our society tells us that if something bothers us, that means its a bad thing and we need to "get help", whether from a mental therapist or medication. And while it is important to have that option, I'm not sure it's always necessary. In this case, if you are functioning normally (able to get out of bed in the morning, able to feed and clothe yourself), you probably just have "regular" anxiety/stress. So I think people have given good suggestions about that (make sure you're getting enough sleep, positive thinking, meditation/prayer, journaling...). Dealing with stress is an acquired skill, I think. (I certainly need to increase my skillset in this area!)<br>  <br>  If of course your anxiety is getting to the point where it really is  adversely affect your life, seek professional help. But maybe try some of the regular stress-reducers first. Good luck and don't beat yourself up. You're 16. Time enough for that later.... ;-)|`|5BmnSiqUaa	Actually, most of your 'symptoms' describe normal, expected adolescent angst.  Put simply, growing pains.<br>  <br>  However, should they surpass a certain threshold to where they are not simply bothering you but interfering outright with your daily life, your sleep patterns, your diet and, in general, your health and safety, seek professional help.<br>  <br>  Since "All work and no play makes Jane a dull girl," don't forget to gather with friends and family to simply have fun.  It works wonders.  <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, volunteering also helps if nothing else than to focus your attentions externally.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you've ever seen an episode of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire," you've seen contestants navigate themselves out of difficult situations by 'talking through' a problem.  Of course, my recommendation is to talk through the situation with someone - anyone - whom you can trust to be discreet.<br>  <br>  Professionally prescribed pills mostly attempt to balance the brain's chemistry.  That's one way.  Another is exercise.  Years of study prove exercise release endorphins (happy chemicals) into the brain.  That's simply scientific proof of that old saying, "A sound mind in a sound body."<br>  <br>  Don't forget to have fun.  Always.  Really.  <br>  <br>  Take your golden opportunity now.  In a few short years from now, it's all about jobs, mortgages and minivans.  Only then will you look back to being 16 and . . . smile.<br>  .<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  .|`|9g7eeUmaaa	What you've described doesn't sound abnormal- but actually quite common- especially for your age group. For most I would say that you don't need pills for it. Before you go that route, try breathing excercises, try to relax and organize your thoughts. <br>  <br>  From another angle- Some would say that you are under a spiritual attack which is causing you stress over things that really shouldn't. IE: those nagging thoughts that take your inner peace. You should pray for peace of mind. And know that you are capable of living a healthy mentally stable life.<br>  <br>  Take care & good luck!|`|0ffdb9dc23ea4daa66d018dcdabc0a14aa	I know what you are going through. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder about 5 years ago. I tried everything but nothing seem to work. My doctor wanted to try therapy and it did help up to a point. My doctor decided to put me on an anxiety medication and it really helped. Good Luck|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	I would not do as the other person says and take pills. You should seek counseling though, but how do you know for a fact that your worries are silly? If they worry you they are not silly. I would suggest that you see someone but I would not be so quick to take a pill for it.Good luck|`|2f7quW5Naa	Ha I know how you feel. I used to be a total wreck a four years ago and it was hard to function without negative thoughts in the back of my head 24/7. Anxiety is understandably stressful and as a 17 year old in high school I believe I know how you feel. Try doing positive self talk in your mind, for instance: I'm going to have a good day today no matter what others do. Replace your negative thoughts, for instance if your thinking your going to mess up on the job, tell yourself: I'm going to have a good day at work and I'm not going to let silly little things get in the way. I don't know what your going through or what is annoying you specifically but self talk does help. Maybe you should consider about talking to someone. I hope this advice helps. :]|`|bZK5Gm1Vaa	Don't rely on pills. Because if you can help yourself get over it, then you'll just rely on the pills to make you feel better, then you accumulate addictions, and I don't believe you'd want that.<br>  <br>  I've had problems with anxiety, and I think it just comes with growing up.<br>  I hope all goes well, try not to think about it too much. Have fun as much as possible.<br>  <br>  ?|`|mjeg5HDsaa	Ok you don't actually need pills. You sound like you have anxiety but it's not that severe if you're not having panic attacks. If you get panic attacks then you have a problem. I have anxiety and I got this book by Reneau Peurifoy. I think it's called 'Anxiety, Phobias and Panic' which is really good for learning to deal with stress/worries/anxiety. You can also check out his website <a href="http://www.rpeurifoy.com/peu_indx.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpeurifoy.com/peu_indx.htm</a> <br>  You can overcome this by yourself without medication :) <br>  Learn to relax yourself, some diaphragmatic breathing and think positive.|`|boCvwZg6aa	1. If you're going to seek help, get a therapist. Not a psychiatrist. They view problems in that 'Doctor' way. "Wham, bam, thank you Ma'am." They'll probably diagnose you with a learning disorder or Bi-Polar disorder.<br>  <br>  2. Narrow down the things you do wrong. If you notice you might mess something up, calm down and fix it. Don't worry. Be happy.|`|bC8r2YTCaa	you should talk to your doctor and he will most likely give you pills for it ....good luck
p9GOxzsNaa	Milia are small keratin filled cysts and are not acne. Milia need to be fully removed to prevent reoccurance. Apply a warm compress, and then unroof them with a small needle and what's inside can be pryed out like a splinter would be extracted. You can also use a comedone extractor. <br>  For prevention, acne creams with Retin-A or Salicyclic acid, Benzoyl Peroxide (2.5%) based lotion  or monthly salicylic acid peels can be helpful but be sure to keep these products away from the eyes or mucus membranes. Keep toothpaste and irritants away from the lip area, rinse with water and avoid hard scrubbing of the facial area.

I believe they have a wash designed for the body such as back acne.  Check them out. I used them for a while and think they did pretty good. I only say pretty good because I needed more than just face wash/cleansers, my dr. had to put me on antibiotics to help calm my skin down. I would start with them. You can usually order online or in stores such as Ulta, Sephora.|`|26XBTFidaa	I cant really suggest any produsts cause i myself used a lot of all kinds of them and nothing really hepled, it helps for a while, then your skin adopts to it and u have to buy something else. I just gave up and didnt used anything and now everything disapeared (i am 20years old) But if u really want to use something please dont use any of the cheap staff, u will safe money but it might ruin your skin, expesially face. Buy something good, expensive for face cause all that cheap staff helps at the beggining but then u will have to use something to calm your skin and to bring it back to a normal looking. <br>  Best luck to you! Dont give up! Fight to the end :)

It helps keep my gums healthy and less swollen, good luck.|`|0u79iDAvaa	Floss usng a thing called super floss, it has a stiff end which can be threaded through the gaps in the teeth that are blocked by the braces. you could also use a chlorhexedine mouthwash which prevents gum problems and help clear them up. make sure your brushing for 2 mins 2x a day as it keeps and plaque off the teeth and will keep them cleam meaning there will be no bleeding!! if its worse and doesnt go away you should see a hygienist for a scale and polish which will help, they should give you oral hygiene instruction too.|`|aFnXBpi7aa	You should floss. Once you get your braces off the swelling will go down, though. You can also massage them with your finger.
