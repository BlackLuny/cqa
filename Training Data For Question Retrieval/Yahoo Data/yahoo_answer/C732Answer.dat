dc52e1e4a57ed04eee0f5039805dc230aa	Da ich eine echte Schw?bin/Schwarzw?lderin bin, fhle ich mich kompetent, die Frage zu beantworten ;-)    Dinnerle sind die dnnen "Testbrote" mit denen frher die Ofenhitze beim Brotbacken geprft wurde. Deshalb nimmt man am besten Brotteig.  Und weil Hitze sehr wichtig ist, stellt man den Backofen auf h?chste Temperatur und stellt von Anfang an ein dunkles Backblech auf den BODEN des Backofens. Noch besser ist eine Schamottplatte von Ofenbauer. Ordentlich vorheizen!!!  Mein Spezialtipp fr den Teig: Brotbackmischung fr Roggenbrot oder Ciabatta verwenden. Wenn Du ein genaues Hausrezept haben m?chtest, frage ich auf Wunsch meine Mama. Vom gemischten Teig einen faustgro?en Klumpen flach drcken und sehr dnn ("dinn") auswellen/ziehen.  Mit allem belegen, was gerade verfgbar und passend ist; ich bevorzuge die "Ur" = Flammkuchen-Variante: mit Schmand, Zwiebelringen und Speckstreifen. Nicht zu dick belegen, denn die Dinnerle werden nur ca 5-7 Minuten gebacken.  Pizza schmeckt so zubereitet brigens auch  prima!|`|bc03759272d9354fa462abe518d83a49aa	Jaime hat folgendes geschrieben:  wer kennt die heissen ?fen nicht, die uns auf Volksfesten und Stadtfesten so umschmeicheln, mit Dften, Gerchen...

AA11866952	Well, there are a few approaches.     Eat more friut -- especially pineapples or mandarin oranges -- the really sweet ones. Your fix is likely on the sugar, not on other chemicals in the chocolate, so eat sweet fruits until you are full, and you shouldn't be craving chocolate as much. At least this way, you get nutrition.    Another way is too eat so much chocolate that you get sick of it and don't want it anymore. You can actually eat so much that you get sick, and I guarantee your body will have an avulsion to eating it in the future. I don;t recommend doing this though.    Also, try eating carob -- which is a health food chocolate. It tastes somewhat like chocolate, but for some reason there is a  disgusting aftertaste, and it will make you not want to eat chocolate anymore. You can pick it up at any health food store.    Finally, if you are sleep deficient, get more sleep. Studies published recently in New England Journal of Medicine have linked sugar cravings and general overeating to consistent lack of sleep (7 hours or less per night). Get 8-10 hours per night, and it will help your craving.    Best of luck!|`|0eb4e638c877083b1e0042770764ed79aa	i LOVE chocolate too! but i don't eat it every day. You can try substituting for a piece of fruit. Fruit has got natural sugars that your body craves & will be satisfied with, but it's much more healthier!|`|8d3103b7b8fd3f96f4eec629226abd42aa	Replace it with something else and ween yourself off of it. Or make it unavailable. Don't buy it. Don't go near it at the store. And if it doesn't work, get dark chocolate because it's the best for you. I recommend the Endangered Species Bar--it's vegan (lower fat than milk chocolate), less sugar, and organic, plus it donates to help prevent extinction. Plus it's expensive so you won't buy as much of it. They come in varying sizes, and they are sold at Giant Eagle and Shop-n-Save.

Auch die Beilagen kann man sich gestalten  wie man will. Als Salz sollte man nur grobes Meersalz verwenden. Der Fisch wird dadurch nicht versalzen. Das Salz h?lt den Fisch saftig. Am besten festfleischige Fischsorten nehmen. Die Garzeiten sind bei 1 Kg Fisch ca. 25- 30 Minuten bei 200  C.  Reichlich Kr?uter verwenden.  Selber habe ich das mit Aal und Lachsforelle gemacht.

Dann den Fisch herausnehmen und die Salzkruste vorsichtig aufklopfen, alle Reste des Salzes entfernen. Die Haut von der Oberseite der Forelle entfernen, abziehen und das Fischfilet von den Gr?ten l?sen. Dann die Hauptgr?te entfernen und das untere Filetfleisch von der Haut l?sen.

Persoanlly, I use lime-salt to actually GIVE it flavor.  Since i usually drink Guinness, I find that those beers lack substance and flavor.  I prefer not to drink them because I find something truly worng with having to add salt to a beer to give it "flavor".|`|sAbaBBRwaa	It depends on the beer for me. I put salt in coronas and other mexican beers and thats it because it brings out the flavor in a different way i also use a slice of lime in there too.

I don't belch as much.  (salt removes carbonation)  5. I can drink more and don't fill up as fast. (less carbonation)  6. My dad/grandpa always drank it this way. (family tradition)  7.

Salt evens out the taste, cuts down any bitter taste, reduces the carbonation, and causes you to hit the bathroom less.

Fv6l1Kivaa	Il caf nn ha calorie... per questo  un'ottima bevanda anche x chi sta a dieta!!  A chi l'uso del caff provoca troppo eccitamento ed insonnia viene consigliato di astenersene o usarne con moderazione; l'effetto potrebbe anche essere corretto mescolandovi un po' di cicoria oppure orzo tostato. L'uso costante potrebbe neutralizzare gli effetti negativi del caff su molte persone, ma potrebbe anche nuocere, essendovi dei temperamenti tanto eccitabili da non essere correggibili. Pellegrino Artusi sosteneva che l'uso del caff dovesse essere proibito ai pi giovani.    Secondo una diceria ottocentesca, il caff eserciterebbe un'azione meno eccitante nei luoghi umidi e paludosi e si riteneva che questa fosse la ragione per cui i paesi in cui se ne fa maggior consumo in Europa sono il Belgio e l'Olanda. In Medio Oriente, ove si usa di ridurlo in polvere finissima e farlo all'antica per berlo ancora torbido, il bricco, nelle case private,  sempre sul fuoco.    Secondo il medico Paolo Mantegazza, patologo ed igienista, il caff - contrariamente a quello che comunemente si pensa - non favorisce in alcun modo la digestione; tuttavia pu essere fatta una distinzione: il criterio pu essere riferito a coloro ai quali il caff non provoca eccitazione particolare, mentre per coloro sensibili alla bevanda, pu portare la sua azione anche sul nervo pneumogastrico; ed  un dato di fatto innegabile che possano digerire meglio (e l'uso invalso di prendere una tazza di buon caff dopo un lauto pranzo ne  una testimonianza, neppure troppo indiretta).    Preso alla mattina a digiuno pare che il caff sbarazzi lo stomaco dai residui di una imperfetta digestione e lo predisponga ad una colazione pi appetitosa (addolcito e allungato con acqua pu anzi sostituire la prima colazione).    Prima di mettersi in viaggio il caff non  consigliato, se non dopo aver mangiato. Infatti  uno stimolante e facilita l'attenzione, ma favorisce anche un'ipersecrezione gastrica fastidiosa, soprattutto a stomaco vuoto.    Il caff mescolato al latte bollente (il famoso cappuccino) ha la propriet di bloccare l'appetito.

Colocar um pouco de assafr?o, se gostar, pega bem.  2- Coloque cebola picada e tambm refogue.  3- Coloque gua suficiente para caldo. Uns 3 dedos acima        da mistura j refogada. Deixe ferver um pouco. J coloca        ai um pouco de sal, pimenta.  4- Coloque um pouco da farinha de mandioca, n?o muito.        Espere ferver, a farinha leva um tempo para encorporar.       Vai exprementando o sal e vai corrigindo aos poucos..        Ainda ficou ralo?, coloque mais um pouco de farinha        e deixe fervendo um pouco.. e ai vai.. n?o coloque muita       farinha de uma vez, se n?o vira uma pasta...ai vc vai me        xingar....  5- Ent?o j deu aquela textura cremosa no caldo n....??       Ai vc j deve estar com o sal no ponto do seu gosto.      Coloca-se ent?o os ovos inteiros com gema e clara neste       caldo, pode ser 3 ou mais.. depende da quantidade..       Neste ponto com ovos colocados, n?o mexa na panela,        deixe os ovos cozinharem..(de 3 a 5 min.)        Eles ficam incorporados, mas n?o mexidos..         Se vc quizer  mexer tudo bem, eu prefiro  sem.  6 - Desligue o fogo, em cima coloque a cebolinha folha,         salsa, coentro, ou outras folhinhas do tipo.    OBS.: Se for peixe, desfie ele sem espinhos e n?o coloque              ovos... Vai sair um pir?o muito legal.              Fa?o isso, com qualquer carne ou peixe que sobra              do almo?o...    Espero que vc ou alguem ai do grupo goste....    At e paz a todos...|`|3411e88c45ded242afc9892ed5d6c11aaa	Pijama...

You create a roux with the fat from the grease; but the hard part is that you have to separate the fat from the drippings. Just pour it all into a measuring cup and spoon out the fat. Add the fat back into the original pan, heat and whisk it with flour to create a roux. Use about 1 or 2 tbsp of flour; you want a pasty consistency.    Add the drippings and about a cup of stock; maybe two cups depending how much you have. Add some seasonings; definitely salt/pepper, maybe some fresh herbs if you have them. Any will do.    I like to finish my gravy with a little butter, 1 or 2 tbsp.|`|0b508e8a46ceb076d498c94707fa4b1aaa	Take  2 tablespoons of oil from the steak. Heat on medium. Add 1/4 cup of flour.

Pour into skillet, stirring constantly until thickened.  Taste and adjust salt and pepper; can also add a little more seasoned salt.  Place patties into gravy and turn to coat.  Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes or until done.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Are you using the stock with the gravy packet?  I thought most packets just required water.    If you want to make gravy from your pan drippings here's what you do.    Skim off most of the fat in the skillet from browning the meat, leave about 1 - 2 TBLS of grease.  Into the hot pan, sprinkle in about 1- 2 TBLS of flour.  Mix in the grease and stir around until it gets some color (it will get a toasty color).  Then add about 1 - 2 cups of stock, water, or a combo of stock/water/wine etc.    Cook over medium heat, stirring to elminate lumps, until thickened.    The basic formula is    1TBLS FLour  1TBLS Grease (butter, pan drippings, margarine, lard, etc.)  1 Cup Liquid

1d2d0fb9a5ef712a04bd7b849e5611a1aa	Honestly it just depends on what 'kind of vegetarian' or what 'kind of meat eater' you are.  If you eat lots of fried foods, soda, etc.  Then both diets are bad.  However, there have been quite a few studies done that overall vegetarians live about 10 years longer, have less heart disease, and are less likely to have various common health problems, like cancer, than the meat eaters.  You have to take in consideration that all animal products have cholesterol and that is not found in the plant/fruit diet naturally.  So, if you are eating tons of meat, yes you are getting things like iron but you are also getting the bad stuff with it.    You can be healthy eating both--as long as you eat balanced meals, choose wisely and shop wisely.  But like I said, vegetarians have been found healthier overall.  If you want recipes there are a ton of online resources.  It's hard to give you recipes since that is such a broad question--I mean what kind of recipes are you looking for besides vegetarian?  All you have to do is type in a specific recipe you want in the search toolbar or type in a broad term like 'meat recipes' or 'vegetarian recipes' and you will get lots of links.  Off the top of my head, foodnetwork.com has lots of choices and then Vegetarians Recipes .org ...just search and you will find many.|`|AA11173395	Vegetarian is healthier.  Animals in industrial situations are given feed laced with pesticides, and are injected with huge amounts of hormones and antibiotics.  These substances can be found in all cuts of meat.   Meat eaters have much higher rates of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, colon cancer, and all digestive disorders.

However given a choice of either eating only meat or only vegetables, I'd choose the meat diet as being healthier.|`|EApHtKr6aa	If you eat less meat you're healthier.These days the meat has a lot of hormones, which is not healthy at all.Fruits and vegetables should be the basic aliments in your diet.Try to live healthy because nowadays this is the most important- to survive|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Both diets are healthy, if done in moderation and with common sense.  Red meat has lots of iron and there are alot of lean cuts to choose from;  pork and lean chicken are healthy too.   If you're a vegetarian, you need to be careful that you're getting the right amount and types of protein.  Someone on either diet regime can still be eating a ton of candy, cookies, cakes & sugary products, which obviously isn't healthy.  Even meat-eaters should be eating 4-5 servings of fruits & vegetables per day.......|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Eating meat helps the US Economy more than being Vegetarian does.    Most meats are domestic products, while the US imports MOST of its fruits and veggies.    So if an American REALLY loves the USA - then they would eat meat to save American jobs................|`|4XUUVDM3aa	I love meat but I think the best is a mix of both .  It depends a lot on your view points and the availablity of frest food to you.  Meat pack a lot of vitamin that you can't eat from being vegetarian. What kind of recipes do you want?|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	both can be healthy, both can be ATROCIOUS. I will give you an example. My dad has been a vegetarian for 30 some years. (He's currently 60) and when he was 50 he had a large stroke because he was so unhealthy (but that was a wake up call for him and he lost 80 pounds and is very healthy now :) . Pizza, potato chips, french fries, cake and icecream are vegetarian but it doesn't mean that they're healthy. :/

a6edcb2fccade96ef629f51b107759f2aa	When I first come to America, I see place called McDonald's, it sale cheap convientient food and many people were there, so I say to myself "Raj, every time you see McDonalds it is packed with customers, this must be very good place to eat." So I go to the McDonalds and order this Quarterpounder with chee and the french fries and a coke. It was the most horrid thing I had ever eaten. I thought I was going to vomit immediatly. Some how I managed to hold it down, but when it came out a few hours later, OH MY GOD! There was nothing solid in the bowl, all liquid. And the smell! If you mix the smell of rotting eggs, sour milk, skunk, and decomposing flesh, I would call that perfume compared to what came out of my body that day. To this day I wonder why americans eat such garbage if it does such things to them.     But I see that McDonalds is succseful buisness, and 10 years later after running and then selling very profitable lawn care buisness, I buy McDonalds franchise, and I pay $2 an hour extra to person who has to clean restroom.|`|764d4bc341405ef3889762eb90c91208aa	Last weekend I ate mcdonalds for breakfast then about five hours later I had major crap cramps in Carson Parie Scott and had to run to the bathroom and it all came out so loud and smelly!!

AA12336927	Hungarian Chicken Paprikas   The perfect Hungarian comfort food. Serve over my posted nokedli recipe. This recipe has been passed down in my family for generations.

A simple question with no easy answers. Studies have produced varying recommendations over the years, but in truth, your water needs depend on many factors, including your health, how active you are and where you live.     Though no single formula fits everyone, knowing more about your body's need for fluids will help you estimate how much water to drink each day.       Eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the "8 x 8 rule"  drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, "drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day," as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though the approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink.|`|8485a74706da9a6fe0a648561ee38745aa	The "average"person should drink at least 64 ounces (2 Quarts) each day.

If your asking this question your the only one that can answer that question. If it interferes with your ability to keep a job and maintain a comfortable living condition then maybe you need to stop long enough to evaluate it's necessity in your life. Addiction comes in many forms but only you can decide if you want or need help with it. Blessed Be. Good Luck--|`|ITJtxINpaa	none|`|pC3qtVVbaa	none...|`|VMT3LKbmaa	None.    Why does it matter if you're addicted or not? Just stop doing it if you're concerned, which you should be, because breathing smoke into your lungs is incredibly unhealthy.    If you're not concerned, then it doesn't matter how much you do it.
9EdJHqKHaa	Yes. Due to the fact that you are of age you would also be found at fault just for being there if there is under age drinking involved. Possibly with a good lawyer and the the others giving statements that you had nothing to do with the drinking you MAY get off without being charged for supplying alcohol. If the cops were to be called, more then likely you would be taken in to be questioned by the police, and if they decide to, you could be charged. You should use your better judgment in situations like that.|`|ku7s4H83aa	Yes, it's called guilty by association.|`|YEGDdBgkaa	Yes, usually anyone in attendance can get in trouble , even if they had nothing to with it.

Curry powder is a blend of coriander, turmeric, cumin, and fenugreek with possible other spices added.  My local grocery store (I'm in California) sells mild, hot and red curry powders.    The term curry is broadly used, in English and refers to any spiced, sauce-based dishes cooked in Indian cuisine including various southern and southeastern Asian styles. All Curry Dishes have a unique name, but generally any side dish made with gravy, vegetables and/or meat is referred to as a "curry" - especially the yellow and red, powders and sauces with high proportions of turmeric. Sometimes a curry dish in Indian cuisine is also referred as a side dish with gravy.    Some examples:    Dahl baht- rice and lentil soup  dum aloo - potato  kadhai paneer (paneer is a kind of cheese)  Tadka Dhal Fry - lentils in a sauce  Murgh makhani  - butter chicken|`|6izMqiBVaa	Chicken curry  mutton curry  beef curry  Curry is the solid with a mixture of water and masala|`|FQ3X9Kdlaa	1.

cLa7nwhcaa	Desserts offered at full service resatuarnts, take-aways, and buffets are all slightly different and limited.  At a buffet, you might find "fruit cocktail in cream", you will not find at takeaway    At a full service restaurant, you might find Kulfi, but not at a buffet or a takeaway    Gulab Jamun, Rice pudding, and Gajar Halwa are defacto Indian desserts offered by every type of food service operation.    Full service restaurants offer their own siganture desserts.    The Takeaways carry more desserts than either full service restaurants or Buffets. Takeaways might offer Pistachio Burfee, Moti-choor Laddu, Jalebi, and Rasgulla.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	My fav is Gulab Jamun|`|ycNt74yyaa	Yum!|`|2QejTvhEaa	in winter, carrot halwa is most desirable.|`|6izMqiBVaa	gulab jamun   Falooda  Kulfa  gajer ka halwa(carrot smoothie type thing?)
VQqpv98yaa	Hi Ana,   I'm french, please excuse me for my poor english.  We usualy dink red wine with meat, never with fish or seafood (we drink it with white wine).  The best is beef, or chicken, mutton, and maybe potatoes, or beans.  That's very good with french or italian food, but also with indian receipes, something gravy with meat and not too much spicy.   I wish you a good valentine Day !!|`|EMh3cD7Maa	Red wine with beef ( steaks, roast, etc.) or any Italian dish with red sauce!    White wine with seafood, fish, veal, pork and chicken.|`|BWxSSADaaa	I love a glass of nice red wine, with a rare cooked steak.  My favorite way is with the steak finished in a cognac-mushroom sauce.  This is the way my favorite French restaurant does it!  It comes with a side of potatoes au gratin and a vegetable.  Extremely tasty!    Pork chops, and lamb are also good with red wine.  I love lamb, too.|`|GRBfQWTxaa	Grilled salmon and veggies.|`|7iC8Fz3Naa	The best foods that taste really really good with red wine is definitely steak! Any kind of meat will go well, but my preference is always a nice New York Strip steak!   And if your going out on a date--most women will not drink red wine because it stains their teeth or lips. White wine goes especially well with any kind of fish dinner. And if you can't decide, then go with a Blush wine (those pink looking wines) they are sweet and served cold. Everyone enjoys that!|`|0652e17f9d7b965dbf45d90fb460f124aa	http://www.thewinedoctor.com/advisory/op...|`|W86sginbaa	the rule is red wine with red meat and white wine with white meat.  spend the day together. have a lavish lunch.|`|8485a74706da9a6fe0a648561ee38745aa	Whatever you have, end the meal with a nice Cab with a Chocolate dessert.

KeevlZnTaa	If your diet is healthy and balanced than you do not need to eat meat while pregnant. You need to do research(like any expectant mother), and make sure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs. There are plenty of books, websites, etc that can give you an idea of what you should be eating. If possible it is a good idea to talk to a nutritionist that is knowledgeable about vegetarianism.    Weather you feed your children meat is a personal choice, but it is not necessary. The American dietetic association and the dietitians of Canada(1) have stated that an appropriately planned vegetarian diet is healthy for all stages of life. Some people choose to raise their children as vegetarian and others with meat, but either choice must be balanced and healthy.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Why don't you sit down with your OB-GYN and discuss it?  Tell them your typical daily diet, and they'll let you know if it's healthy when you're pregnant.   You probably aren't getting enough complex proteins or iron on a veg diet, so you might need to add some small portions of meat to your diet|`|AA12334360	There are plenty of life-long vegetarians / vegans who raise vegetarian / vegan families    What you heard was rubbish|`|NNiN0tK0aa	No......a vegetarian can give you everything you need to grow a baby.  Lots of people on omnivore diets dont eat especially healthily and still have healthy babies - if you eat a wholefood vegetarian diet then you'll be eating healthier than the vast majority of pregnant women - whether they eat meat or not.    Alse see thegardendiet.com for a woman whose had very healthy children on a RAW vegan diet - although I don't recommend that.  There are stories of children on raw vegan diets not thriving.  But children on cooked vegan diets do wonderfully - most never get colds/flues/allergies etc.  That's vegan  - vegetarian is nothing to worry about at all.|`|bge945ytaa	No, talk with your doctor. He/she will help you with your dietary needs as a pregnant vegetarian.  =]|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	You absolutely DO NOT have to eat meat when you're pregnant. You have to be more careful with your diet when you are pregnant, whether you eat meat or not, but there is no reason why you can' use meat alternatives to have a healthy pregnancy.    There is extensive information at the links below|`|8WdFnf0Eaa	There are literally hundreds of book available that can guide you through a healthy, cruelty-free pregnancy.  It takes some doing, but it is doable.|`|LVDd4Q1Jaa	there are plenty of vegan pregnant people|`|6tpSDl2oaa	You can actually be very healthy (as in getting all your nutrients) from a vegan diet.  What is important is eating a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds.  I know one too many vegetarians who think it is healthier to eat bread and cheese than it is to eat grilled chicken and a vegetable. (and FYI, contrary to popular belief, eating soy-meat substitutes all the time is NOT healthy for you).    If you do vegetarianism/veganism correctly, then there is no reason why you cannot remain a veg while pregnant.  The key is "eating all the colors of the rainbow".      That said, you also need to listen to your body.  If it is craving red meat than it is perhaps due to the fact that you are low on B12 or iron.  In that case, try some dark green leafy veggies (like kale) or some fresh melon or even some nutritional yeast.  A way to pack a lot of nutrients in is to make some fresh fruit/veggie juice or even smoothies (try Pat Crockers Juicing Bible).  If that doesn't do the trick, then no one is going to scorn you for trying a steak if that is what your body needs.      Vegetarianism and Veganism are a personal belief system...and like any belief system they are apt to change.  There are no "strict rules" and there isn't a "veg police squad" that is going to come arrest you if you "cheat.  So do what *you* feel is right.|`|3SY0ObRQaa	You can get all the goodness you need on a vegetarian diet.  My mum was vegetarian and brought me up a vegetarian and ive been so thankful to her.  I'm now vegan, as is she.  I hope you opt to bring up your child vegetarian|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	It's quite possible to continue vegetarianism during pregnancy providing your body will co-operate. A friend of mine went from being vegetarian pre-pregnancy to eating medium rare steaks each day during pregnancy. That was rather a shock to her, but the cravings were incredible.
spS2lnDXaa	I know, right?    People don't always get why I buy organic and fair trade certified products when I could go and save money by not doing so. I do it because I want to look back knowing I made a difference.     Some people just don't think about what that jacket or that shampoo they're buying is really supporting, especially with small things. It all builds up.|`|iXx9SWceaa	OH NO! I'M NOT A VEGAN AND I'M ANSWERING! Well, I'm a vegetarian, and will be a vegan when I move out of my parent's house.    Anyway, I totally agree. I told my mom that I refused to wash myself with anything that was tested on animals, so she buys me White Rain, super cheap, shower things, and some toothpaste which name I cannot quite remember, and I don't want to go to the bathroom to find out, lazy.     But just because something's cheaper doesn't mean it's better. And just because we CAN, doesn't mean we SHOULD.|`|doz7RIoeaa	And the real question is? I ask because you answered it before you even asked it and you pretty much ranted for the most part.    One reason why designer labels and vegan clothes in general do not get mass support is because they are ugly. And as you said, price. Seems vegan clothes makers are taking advantage of the fact that vegans have very little choices and are often "forced" to buy from them despite the price. Think of it as vegan clothing manufacturers taking advantage and exploiting vegans limitations for personal/financial gain. Sounds familiar doesn't it?  I'm not vegan but Yahoo says I can answer the question since this is an open forum.     Thank you|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	the solution is eco friendly, and vegan products that pay that workers a living wage. or dumpster diving http://www.freegan.info|`|NNiN0tK0aa	You can buy things made out of recycled rubber - from the inner tubes of bicycle tires.  Not quite the same thing as pvc/leather but nice in their own right.  You can also buy second hand pvc products from a charity shop.

TL1Jkqunaa	Thin slices of any  white fish boiled in slightly salty water.  If the slices are less then 1/2 thick start them in cold water.  By the time it is boiling it is finished, it flakes apart easily.  If thicker, boil until it flakes apart.  With salt, pepper, and lemon juice it is pretty good.  Little mess, low calorie, and obviously, easy.   Also the fish is pretty good cold later in sandwiches, salads, and so on.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	eat sashimi, it's raw meat w/ no fat!|`|7JpPe3uCaa	POACHED SALMON    4 (6 oz) salmon steaks  1 quart water  1/2 C white wine  1 small onion, quartered and sliced lengthwise  1 tsp salt  10 peppercorns  Mustard-Dill or Cucumber-Lemon Sauce    Combine water, wine, onion, salt and peppercorns in a large skillet.  Bring to boil.  Add  salmon and return to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until salmon flakes easily, about 10 minutes.  Remove salmon and drain.  Serve with Mustard-Dill or Cucumber-Lemon sauce.     MUSTARD-DILL SAUCE    2 TBSP butter  1 TBSP chopped green onions  2 TBSP flour  1 cup lite cream  1 TBSP dijon mustard  1 TBSP fresh dill weed, chopped  1/2 tsp salt  dash white pepper  1 TBSP lemon juice    Melt butter in small saucepan.  Add onion and cook just until softened.  Stir in four, cream, mustard dill, salt and pepper to taste.  Cook and stir over low heat until mixture thickens.  Stir in lemon juice.        CUCUMBER-;LEMON SAUCE    1 large cucumber, peeled and seeded  salt  1/4 C light mayonnaise  1/4 C light sour cream  1 tsp grated lemon peel  1 TBSP lemon juice  1 tsp minced onion    Shred cucumber and sprinkle lightly with salt.  Let stand 30 minutes.  Drain and squeeze to remove liquid.  Place cucumber in bowl.  Add remaining ingredients,  stir to blend.    (This sauce is thick, like a tartar sauce)|`|BWxSSADaaa	I like fish baked simply with a little olive oil drizzled over, and lots of lemon juice.  Also season with salt, pepper and chopped herbs (tarragon, basil, parsley, dill ...) and maybe some minced garlic.  Cutting slices of fresh lemon or orange and laying them on the fish as it bakes is good too, and keeps it moist.  Basically, I like any citrus with it.  A combination of lime, cilantro, a little fresh chili sauce/chopped chilis, maybe some basil and mint, sounds good too!  Kind of Southeast Asian inspired.|`|nfu6LiVXaa	Steamed fish - steam the fish with a bit of olive oil, lemon juice, ginger and green onion. Add salt and pepper to taste. Healthy, low fat, fast and no mess.|`|71h39Q5faa	I loved foods with seasoning.  You can broil, sautee, bake or grill almost any white fish.  I enjoy using tilapia.    Clean the fish with lemon juice or vinegar.   Season with creole or cajun seasoning on both sides.  You can add dry pepper flakes or hot sauce if you prefer more heat.  Broil or bake in the oven.  Can be grilled on top of the stove.  Cook 3-5 minutes on each side depending on the thickness.  Quick, easy and low fat.    Buy or make a low salt seasoning if you prefer.

spS2lnDXaa	Certainly. Apparently soy protein is real heart healthy. There have been quite a few recent tests which show that dairy milk actually promotes osteoporosis(I'm gonna get like 37489374 thumbs down just because I typed that, watch... ;] ). You can look it up if you don't believe me.    Buy the fortified soymilk though.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	yes its ok for a teenage to drink soymilk    the side of the carton of silk soymilk show it has more of some nutrients than cow milk|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	There is a very big difference! Soy "milk" is not milk. It is a dairy substitute made from soy beans that has lots of vitamins and nutrients that humans need. Milk comes from lactating cows and is made for baby cows.    There are links to some more information below|`|6tpSDl2oaa	What kind of nutrients are you looking for?  Calcium?  Vitamin D?  Protein?  Because these can be obtained from numerous other food sources rather than "added in" as they are in cow milk or soy milk.      I don't personally advocate for either.  My research and experience has led me to believe that cow milk isn't fully digestable to human bodies and stresses the liver and soy in large quantities has been known to cause cancer in rats (yes, very large quantities but if you have ever looked at labels it is in EVERYTHING).     If you want a "milk like" substitute, try making your own nut milk/mylk.  Simply blend 1/4 cup of raw almonds, 1/2 vanilla bean or 1 tsp vanilla extract, small amount of agave, and a pinch of salt in 3 cups of water and voila...milk!  You can also use raw pumpkin seeds, cashews, brazil nuts, tahini or any number of nuts and seeds instead of almonds and it is preservative free with no chemicals added because you made it yourself.  Plus it is loaded with vitamins and enzymes.|`|snBeIxpBaa	I've answered this before.. I'll just post what I wrote last time.    Alright, lets get the nutritional facts exposed first      Cows Milk (closest to whole milk)    87.1% Water  3.9% Fat  3.3% Protein (Complete protein)  5.0% Lactose  0.7% Ash (various minerals)    Soy Milk (on average, different processing techniques used to make this alter composition)  91.1% Water  2.0% Fat  3.5% Protein (on average) (Incomplete protein, does not provide all amino acids)  2.9% Carbohydrates (likely a sugar, such as sucrose)  0.5% Ash (various minerals)    Overall, they are fairly similar... now on to calcium.  Soy Milk has to add calcium to the product because the calcium in the soy itself is bound to the bean pulp. (In short, the body cannot use it). Calcium Carbonate is commonly added to provide enough calcium usable for the body to be similar to cows milk.        Overall, Soy Milk and cow's Milk are similar in nutritional status. It is hard to say for every soy milk product, because of different processing techniques used to make them.      I feel I should add that most soy milk is identical once the calcium carbonate is added, however some soymilks tend to be heavily fortified. (such as this Silk Soymilk Plus I tried out, don't believe me?  Check the ingredients)  But soy milk in itself, is identical to cows milk (except in taste, in my opinion... there is a very distinct difference)|`|FQ3X9Kdlaa	Soy milk is disgusting and is not, nor should ever be considered milk.      REAL milk is good and is also made for human consumption.|`|4pco9j9Faa	Soy milk is better, but buy fortified soy milk-- Less fat, no cholesterol, same calcium, plenty of B6 and B12... milk is fatty and fairly bad for you. If you must drink milk buy skim.      Yea, its fine for a teen to drink. I do it every day.|`|SOPVLyjoaa	Soy milk is a good alternative to regular milk.  Usually it's supplemented with calcium.    The only issue I have heard with soy milk is soy has a naturally occurring version of estrogen, which may be an issue for infants.  Haven't seen anything about the impact on teenagers.|`|cx1MrtQzaa	soy is easy-er on your stomach  than milk although milk help you sleep better it also give some people gas.  it is  ok for teens to drink and it also have added vitamins.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Do not eat or drink soy with out looking up the dangers.

TJOHxhEUaa	It's a pain in the neck to do, and quite time-consuming, but here are the instructions:    2 bags All-purpose flour ( 5lb. each bag )  6 gallons of tap water    Step 1. Make a Dough  Place 1 1/2 bags of flour in a wide plastic basin or container leaving one half in the bag. Make a hollow space in the middle portion of the poured flour. Pour water in it and then with one hand mix flour and water with squeezing motions. Mix well and see to it that there are no dry flour balls.    Start forming a bigger dough by sprinkling dry flour from the bag on the wet, mixed flour, fashioning a ball form of dough. Knead the dough hard and continue sprinkling dry flour and kneading till the rubbery, firm and pliant. A good dough does not fall off when washed in water.      Step 2. Wash the Dough  Place the dough in the water basin and put water half full. Make sure the strong and pliant enough to withstand vigorous squeezing and washing without disintegrating. Washing the dough removes the starchy leaving the glutinous matter or the vegemeat and gluten. With the dough submerged in water, make hard squeezing motions. Repeat it a number of times till the water turns milky white. Drain the water, leaving the dough in the basin. Replenish the water in the basin. Repeat the process of kneading and washing the dough till the water remains clear even after vigorous and washing motions. Normally, it takes 5-6 times water replenishments and the raw vegemeat is ready. Raw vegemeat sticks together like a ball.    Step 3. Pre-Cook the Vegemeat or Gluten    Prepare:  2 pounds of raw gluten  1 large onion , diced or chopped  6 cloves of garlic, crushed  4 teaspoons soy sauce  1/2 teaspoon of basil  1 /2 teaspoon black pepper  other preferred seasoning and spices to add flavor    Make gluten balls the size of a small fists. Place them in a big casserole. Add water enough to submerge all the gluten balls. Add the onions, garlic, soy sauce, basil, black pepper and preferred seasoning and spices.  Boil in medium heat for one hour till the water dries up and the gluten is tender and brown. Add water and the necessary ingredients, if needed, to have the gluten well-cooked.    Now the pre-cooked vegemeat is ready for any recipes.|`|9zDkqICbaa	just go get a nice juicy steak..|`|84W8ff0paa	The recipe above sounds great, but if you'd like to save yourself the trouble of rinsing and baking for a bit and all that then I suggest you try Vital Wheat Gluten, which is basically what's left after you rinse the non-gluten stuff out of the big ball of flour. It saves a LOT of time, and makes it a much more enjoyable process.    Hope that helps!|`|llkSmgLJaa	You can make gluten flour by washing the bran and starch out of whole wheat flour. I've done it a couple times, but it's easier to buy the gluten flour. You make a ball of flour mixed with water and nead it under running water.

bb8h33w8aa	Caramel coloring is a water soluble food coloring; it is made by the carefully controlled heat treatment of carbohydrates, generally in the presence of acids, alkalis, or salts, in a process called caramelization. It is more fully oxidized than caramel candy and has an odor of burnt sugar and a somewhat bitter taste.

KeevlZnTaa	If you have been eating meat than the food in your home is going to reflect that. You need to go to the grocery store and buy some vegan friendly foods, and get a few recipes to cook.    It is a good idea to do a little research and to be sure you have a lot of great recipes to cook. The first time I tried to go vegetarian, I didn't last very long. I had no idea what to make, and had nothing in the house b/c I hadn't prepared.    About a month later I tried again, but this time I had recipes planned out, and had gone shopping. After that day I never looked back. I now have tons of recipes that I enjoy. I quickly replaced old meat favorites with tasty vegetarian ones.    I don't know if it is an option, but you may want to try just being a vegetarian for a month or so, in order to get used to not eating meat(if you feel as if you are not ready to be vegan). Instead of falling completely off the bandwagon, you could try vegetarianism first and then after you are used to cooking and finding meat free food, you could eliminate the eggs, and dairy.    The first month or so can be difficult, simply b/c it is new and you don't know what to eat. When you build up your recipes, and learn what vegan food you can buy, it gets easier.|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	How long have you been vegan? If this is a relatively recent habit you are trying to achieve, you may be going too quickly. I would suggest doing this in increments, rather than all at once. I would think that the hardest would be to stop eating dairy and eggs, so this could be the last thing that you stop eating. This is a huge undertaking, so expect to do some more research as to what diverse foods can replenish what you will be cutting out.  My favorite vegetarian resource is "The Moosewood CookBook." You will find excellent recipes here, as well as some nutrition guidance. Best wishes~    ***Tristin*** I'm stealing your NutBurger recipe!!!  :)|`|3u4HU7rdaa	EAT MEAT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ANIMALS ON THE PLANET|`|VjBciucZaa	well being a vegan never helped anyone just eat humans are omnivores we are supposed to eat meat even vegans are omnivores they don't notice that every time they are talking they are swallowing their own cells from the side of their cheeks|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	There are some things that will help. First of all eat some meat alternatives, like lentils, beans, nuts, legumes, tofu etc because your body may be craving more protein. If after that you still want some have something with a similar texture. Roasted mushroom are very meat like, or jerk tofu. Also try some pre-made meat alternatives, like veggie burgers, faux nuggets. Veggie ground round (veggie ground beef) in spaghetti sauce or chili is really good to. Remind yourself of the reasons why you chose to become vegan.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Just stick to eating meat. Not eating meat is ridiculous. Anyways, you would have to take special pills to get the nutrients get from meat. It's a complete waste of time.|`|AA12352550	Just eat what you want!|`|HAgd5asNaa	WHY would you want to be a vegetarian?    Animals don't have souls. If the only two things left on earth were a person and a cow and you had to kill one, who would you kill?    Now DONT say that if it was a cow doing the choosing then you would die because cows dont have souls, only humans. OKAY? Eating meat is 100% fine.    BTW - if you consider it bad to kill animals for food, then what about PLANTS? They live and grow just like animals! Or are plants just not adorable enough for you?|`|047IPSovaa	Well, just eat some of that meat substitute stuff.  Have you heard of tufukey?|`|w4ZY0MKWaa	http://www.peta.org/|`|AA11177214	There is a detox period, as I recall...  That said..I didn't stick to it...just because my favorite food happens to be cheese...  Go to you tube and search for vegan recipes...  Veggies like eggplant, carrots, mushrooms can be cooked in certain ways so that the consistency reminds you of meat...  It's all about tricking the brain.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	I personally never got that whole vegan thing.. You are a natural carnivore.. that's why you produced Sharp pointy teeth,, to eat meat.. Why would someone want to go against natures plan..?????  You should become a vegetarian,, at least that makes more sense..|`|qdGZMGdkaa	vegan is intense. I would purchase a book on different cuisines that you can cook up. World Vegan Fusion Cuisine is a great book. It was voted  1. Cookbook of the Year (2005) - VegNews Magazine  2. Nautilus Book Award: Small Press (2005) - Body & Soul Magazine  3. Best Vegetarian Cookbook U.S. (2005) - Gourmand World Cookbook Award  4. Best New Cookbook Proggy award (2005) - People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. My cousin owned the worst best vegan restraunt in hawaii and his chef wrote this book.|`|S6AjZ2uMaa	Fake meats, bomb *** soy burgers, lentils, tofu...???     No wonder you're having a hard time sticking to it... I'll get thumbs down for saying this, but vegans are completely ignorant. They aren't accomplishing anything, it IS NOT a healthy lifestlye, and animals are here for a purpose... Some for us to eat, some to clean up the earth, some to pollinate and help in reproduction, etc etc... Why can't people just accept that...????|`|WG4zNIlTaa	Dont fight it just go with the flow.|`|QCdpBqhHaa	Buy soy meat...Gardenburger, Boca, Morningstar Farm brands...they sell them at supermarkets.  When cooked in homeade food, they taste delicious! Just think like you could cook anything you want...try meatloaf, use soy ground "beef", Spaghetti &  soy"meatballs", Hamburgers, use   soy "beef" patties...add cheese, lettuce, tomatoe, avocados, soy "bacon" and u got a bomb asss burger. You just have to get creative w/ it.  Soy meat is also a great source of protein.    They have GREAT recipe's here:    http://www.seeveggiesdifferently.com/Rec...|`|xreWOKBYaa	If your values and reasons for being a vegan are not strong enough to make you not want to eat meat you might not be cut out to be!    But, being a vegan isnt easy - keep trying!|`|KNwGCRBcaa	like they said eat meat........|`|Pf5obGu4aa	You could try having a veggie burger i heard that they sometimes taste like meat if you get the good quality kind so maybe that will help you craving for meat.|`|YxMh2aAOaa	lentil   mmmm  also lentil sambosas are really good  the only arabic thing i have eatin before|`|l2mJxB1Caa	People are so insensitive. Good for you. If you want to make your life healthier, give it all you've got. My cousin is a vegan and eats a lot of vegan stuff. i had never experienced any of the food. he brought "tofurkey" for thanksgiving. wow it was good. they have different flavors, i had the one that was stuffed. it was awesome and i couldn't tell it wasn't meat.|`|8WbfmK5daa	I don't get it why bother then?    I think becoming a vegetarian or vegan is to do with a belief with is easy to keep with.    Just eat what you want then|`|eyQBvbzraa	LOOK AT VEGAN WEBSITES. IF YOU ARE CRAVING MEAT IT IS PROBABLY PROTEIN YOU ARE LACKING OR YOU JUST LOVE MEAT.I DO NOT KNOW ALOT ABOUT VEGAN, ACTUALLY I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT BUT TOFU AND BEANS CONTAIN PROTEIN THAT IS FOUND IN MEAT. IF YOU DONT LIKE ANY OF THOSE THINGS I SUGGEST YOU EAT MEAT.WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE VEGAN???SORRY ABOUT THE CAPS, MY EYES ARE HURTING TODAY|`|zPLza1dSaa	Uhm, okay well your pretty much a meatlover is what your saying. Uhm here is some good vegiterean meals that are really good for vegiternenas that need meat.    Nutburgers    An all-time favorite meatless burger. The nutburger is tasty, satisfying and filling, without leaving you with the heavy feeling after eating a beef burger. And it's healthier too!     1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded  2 eggs  1 cup toasted wheat germ or cooked rice  1 cup parsley, finely chopped  3 stalks celery, minced  1 onion, minced   1 cup walnuts, finely chopped  1 green or red pepper, finely chopped  1 tsp salt  1 tbsp basil  2 tsp curry powder     Mix all together in a big bowl, drop batter into patties in hot olive oil in skillet. Use just enough oil to cover the pan bottom. Cook until golden brown. Serve on a bun just like a hamburger, with red onion slice, lettece tomato slice......the works!  Its very good, if you dont like some stuff that is on it just simply take it off are dont fix it.    Irish Colcannon     1 bag frozen hash browns with peppers............ Nutmeg  1 medium onion ........................................... eggs  1 C milk ........................................... C. Shredded cheddar  1 large bunch of fresh kale     In a 9x13 pan, spray with a vegetable cooking spray. Set oven to 375.   Clean kale, and remove stems. Chop onion, fry in small amount olive oil until brown. Add kale & stir until kale is slightly cooked. Add salt and pepper to taste, and 1 tsp nutmeg.   Remove from heat. Spread frozen Hash browns in bottom of sprayed casserole. Add milk. Top with kale and onion mixture. Make 6 'wells'. Break an egg into each well. Top casserole with shredded cheddar cheese. Bake until eggs are set. Time varies by oven, usually 35-40 minutes.    Thank you Kathy McD for this recipe  This is veryy good to. Like i said take off are dont fix the stuff you dont like. Uhm, there is many vegiteraen meals that will help meat lovers. So just google some meals sometimes they really work.    Good Luck :]]|`|SFGNnKfWaa	Maybe try a veggie burger? idk Peanut butter and beans are protiens, kinda like meat. i used to be vegan, it was hard.|`|6tpSDl2oaa	Your body is craving the nutrients that are in meat (perhaps iron, B vitamins, protein) and is trained to crave meat because that is how you have gotten those vitamins in the past.    You need to retrain your body to crave other items.  Try eating melons, dark green leafy veggies, hemp seed, etc.     Also, you need a good cookbook like vegenomicon ;0)|`|eNPcNGSjaa	Jesus Christ, these people are assholes and have no idea what they are talking about.      Meat substitutes have come a long way in the past few years.  There are tons of faux meat that tastes and looks just like the real thing.  There are also thousands of different recipes that require no meat or dairy and taste better than the fatty, greasy crap that most people eat.    The only thing different that a vegan does that a meat eater doesn't is live a healthy, guilty free life.|`|4pco9j9Faa	Your Name Here-- No, I don't think an animal would think twice if we were on it's menu. It would take one look at it's plate and turn away. The animals we eat are herbivores, therefore a human would not eve register as "food".    To lafmaster-- Animals have souls. They may not be as intelligent as humans, but they can feel pain just the same as we can. They have families, lives, a will to survive...and if I was stranded on a desert island with a cow and a human I would find out what the cow was eating and join it. Ever heard that one! It's a famous quote. and plants!? honestly? Plants do not have souls, since they cannot think and do not have a central nervous system. Sentient beings are a lot different then plants.     And to the asker-- I'm sorry the meat eater's just can't seem to resist a question labeled "vegans only".     I found veganism a little tough at first too, but then I went to Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. People there didn't look at me funny. they had no problem with a person as young as I am being vegan, and they immediately showed me the best foods. If you are feeling discouraged with the food you have, try visiting your local health store.    My fav vegan foods are tofu cooked in olive oil, sesame seeds, and breadcrumbs, falafel, tempeh, rice, beans, grains of all kinds... Try asking someone at a health store about all these foods and how to cook them. You'll be surprised at how good vegan food is.|`|3SY0ObRQaa	Ignore many of the stupid answers people have left.  There are loads of vegan alternatives to meat.  I'm not sure where you're from, but if you live in UK, go to Holland and Barrett, in their freezer/fridge section they have loads of vegan food.    Look out for brands such as:     Frys  Redwoods (including Cheatin', Vegi Deli and Cheezly)  Sheese  B'nice (Ice cream)  Swedish Glace  Tofutti  Linda McCartney  Vegetarians Choice..    If you google any of these brands you will see how much food there is and where to buy it.   There are loads more brands but i cant think of them at the moment :)    Feel free to email me on here if you would like any advice: rosesinwinter@ymail.com|`|e47f48ba2f9eef6ff1c257a1214a4030aa	omg when i first went vegan i was craving meat like crazy!! even though i never had before!

Try the stuff on this list:  http://www.peta2.com/STUFF/s-accvegan.as...  good luck!|`|3j6WdOX5aa	Eat meat - Its good and do you think animals would think twice about eating us if we were on their menu?|`|d6F1HUgcaa	TOFU!!!    lol.|`|pQ8ZcPYraa	if you want to be a vegan get used to it. theres no yummy tofu substitute for a delicious steak|`|BtSGEt1Maa	Try tofu and soy products. And if you're really starting to crave, just think of the process that meat goes through...maybe you'll be too grossed out to eat it.|`|V6dz395kaa	There is lots of fake meats, that u can eat, which is not really meat but taste like it. i've had some b4, its good! lol|`|uQZQTAAlaa	Go on YouTube and type in "cow gets killed" or look at animals die for food for humans.

You can buy it from and supermarket and you can get different flavours e.g bacon, chicken ect. it has no dairy products included in it so you should give it a go XD. It's not as good as meat but it sure does help. Hope i helped|`|2bpMVJ6Caa	well, all i could say is to eat meat. you don't need to eat alot, but eat it if you want. It's really not heathy to be a vegan, u need all sorts of protein. Unless you believe alot in animals.|`|u4WIiUdtaa	i agree with that name here person..    animals really wouldn't even think twice about eating us if tey had the cance. just eat the damm meat! ur gona die early without meat. sure if u want to not eat animals u can have the life span of one too. thats like um 30 yearss max??|`|6cdabb0856c87a24e1b7e90f299ff362aa	Go buy some frozen salmon that is cut in double card deck sections. You will need at least one of these per month for a while to stave off anemia. Anemic blood is always the big risk with going vegan at first so you need to take a couple of years to engage your blood on this. Take a vitamin B12 pill too and your craving will drop.|`|ZfY26NMwaa	try eating salads with a little chopped up chicken, ham, or turkey. its not good to just go off it totally too fast. you could make yourself sick  i once got myself sick from not eating meat for 5 weeks. worst ever|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	I'd got to your local bookstore and pick up several vegan cookbooks.  You may be craving parts of your diet you aren't getting.  Veganism is really hard to do in a safe, healthy way.  You need to know a lot about nutrition to do it safely.  It's easier to go vegetarian.  Depending on how strict you are you can still eat things with eggs in them.  Humans have evolved to eat meat.  That's why we have incisor teeth.  That doesn't mean you can't be vegan, but it is going to be difficult.  I tried going vegetarian when I was younger, but I couldn't resist certain foods.  I don't even do particularly good at eating more poultry and fish than white meat.  Try to find some vegan friends to share means with.  It's easier when you have other people to introduce you to some of the strange things you'll end up eating.  (Don't get me wrong, there are some really yummy vegetarian foods out there.)    Make sure you don't let yourself get really hungry.  Those cravings will be at their worst when you are hungry.  Fill up on some whole grain rice and veggies before you get too weak.|`|uAkpp9Ipaa	Craving meat could mean that you are not getting all the essential amino acids you need (proteins) or that you are not getting enough vitamin B12.     Check out this link for vegan sources of vitamin B12:  http://www.healthaliciousness.com/articl...    Another problem is that you may not be getting enough variety in your diet. Going Vegan really is a blessing in disguise because it forces you to try new foods and expand your palate. Have you tried different grains, like quinoa, or millet? Both are cheap, taste great, and are easy to cook.    How to cook quinoa:  http://www.healthaliciousness.com/recipe...    How to cook millet:  http://www.healthaliciousness.com/recipe...    Just hang in there, as you expand the number of fruit, vegetables, nuts, and grains you eat you will adjust and you will stop craving meat. Good luck.|`|cx1MrtQzaa	have you ever try the veggie meat in the stores? they are great.|`|rvZXynxlaa	Being a vegan is a good thing, but if you have been craving meat, I wouldn't avoid it. Everything happens for a reason, and if your craving meat maybe the world is trying to tell you something! Maybe they are trying to say, "Your body has gotten used to eating meat, and than once you stop, your body is still waiting for meat." I am 95% vegan, because protien is good for you. When I am really craving it, I eat it. Once a month, I belive.|`|asXq2cFDaa	Fake meats are good, but should not be eaten very often as they are heavily processed.

7iSfizwhaa	Draft beer is simply beer that is on tap at taverns and bars.  There are an incredible number of beer types out there; a short list would include ales (such as pale ales, cream ales, amber ales, white ales, Trappist ales) "yellow" beers (such as lagers and pilsners), fruit beers (lambics, krieks), dark beers (stouts, porters).  An excellent resource would be a Beer Guide.

It's mainly found at bars.    There are an insane number of beer styles, but the three overarching categories are Ale, Lager and Lambic.

4pco9j9Faa	Why do people post these stupid questions "Did I eat too much today?" and then put some ridiculously tiny amount of food.    EXAMPLE:: "Did I eat too much today?"    I ate two carrot sticks, a piece of celery, and a glass of water. I really shouldn't have eaten that stick of celery... i am going to get fat.    If you are seriously only eating that much, see a nutritionist. Not getting enough food can make your metabolism go into sleep mode, meaning you actually gain weight when you start to eat again.

Over medium to high heat, mix ingredients thoroughly until smooth consistency with a spatula or wooden spoon.   Heat until the sauce just begins to bubble gently, turning up the heat if needed.

1uyhFsFsaa	we call them crisps as they are slices of crispy potato   we also call thin fried sticks of potato fries and chips are thicker sticks of potato lol  i know it can all be confusing why can't everyone just call them the same|`|fb5e6abe0d15467cb8e98fd9cd776d9daa	We don't call fries chips, we call fries fries; chips are different from fries in that they are a lot thicker. What you call chips we call crisps, but we have a far greater variety of these than you, mostly they are thin potato slices that are fried and flavoured, but we do use the term chips for crisps such as Doritos or tortilla chips.|`|65Hm45Cxaa	Crisps, or they have product names like Doritos, Walkers and Space Raiders.

llkSmgLJaa	The enzymes were used to make the cheese. If you eat non-veg cheese your fine. Strict vegetarians would worry if they used enzymes taken from a calves stomach.

9f7c8164ca2d49e24413295051f36abaaa	Even though you already had many responses I wanted to reply to this since many people stated that the enzyme will clearly be labeled if it vegetarian friendly. That is simply not true.     Enzymes can come from three sources; cow stomach, plants, or made in a lab (microbial). The only way to really know is to call the company or check online to see if someone else has already done the calling.     I use this resource often to find vegetarian/non cow enzyme cheese. When I find cheese I want to buy but is not on the list I call them to see what they have to say.   http://cheese.joyousliving.com/|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	they aren't killed specifically for the enzymes.      the enzymes should say they are vegetarian.   animal based enzymes would have pancreatin, trypsin or chymotrypsin|`|AA11173395	Enzymes are found in raw fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds.  Just eat food.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Not all enzymes are unsuitable for vegetarians. Calves are killed to extract enzymes (rennet) for cheese/whey production.|`|DSg4fgnEaa	Interesting question.  Hopefully you won't starve yourself to death in the process.  The problem is food labels are not specific.  Lobbyists have made is so labels can say something and not be true.  All Natural for example is used but it doesn't really mean All Natural.  Anyway, from what I've read on a few labels it will say "Non Animal" in front of the ingredient that contains enzymes.|`|AA12031316	If you mean the type of enzymes used in most cheese, yes the cows are killed for it.  Rennet (enzymes) comes from the 4th stomach of slaughtered baby veal calves (male calves left over from the milk industry, who have no use for non dairy producing cows)  Many cheese just use the term "enzymes" since people have become aware of where rennet comes from.  Some cheeses, such as Cabot brand, use vegetarian enzymes, which come from plant sources.  It will be clearly marked on the package as "vegetarian enzymes".  If not, it is safe to assume it comes from dead animals.

The vinegar contains a host of vitamins, beta-carotene, pectin and vital minerals such as potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorous, chlorine, sulphur, iron, and fluorine.    Pectin in the vinegar is a fiber which helps reduce bad cholesterol and helps in regulating blood pressure. The need for calcium supplements once you start growing older is very well known. This vinegar helps extract calcium from the fruits, vegetables and meat it is mixed with, helping in the process of maintaining strong bones. Potassium deficiency causes a variety of ailments including hair loss, weak finger nails, brittle teeth, sinusitis, and a permanently running nose. Apple cider vinegar is loaded with potassium. Studies have shown that potassium deficiency results in stunted growth. All these ailments can be avoided with the intake of apple cider vinegar. The potassium in this vinegar also helps in eliminating toxic waste from the body. The beta-carotene helps in countering damage caused by free radicals, helping one maintain firmer skin and a youthful appearance. Apple cider vinegar is good for those wanting to lose weight. It helps in breaking down fat which helps in natural weight reduction.     Apple cider vinegar contains malic acid which is very helpful in fighting fungal and bacterial infections. This acid dissolves uric acid deposits that form around joints, helping relieve joint pains. This dissolved uric acid is gradually eliminated from the body.     It is claimed that apple cider vinegar is helpful in ailments such as constipation, headaches, arthritis, weak bones, indigestion, high cholesterol, diarrhea, eczema, sore eyes, chronic fatigue, mild food poisoning, hair loss, high blood pressure, obesity, along with a host of many other ailments. No wonder then many know apple cider vinegar as the "Wonder Drug".

p9rIPd4Maa	Most people get caught out on French fries, you actually consumed roughly 430kcal and 22g of fat. You'll find that the fast food meals, such as McDonald's, have much more fat and more calories in their chips rather than the burger - little wonder why so many people who consistently dine at fast food restaurants begin putting on the pounds!    Your diet for a day seems fairly good and balanced, however, it doesn't appear to contain much Vegetables or fruit (given that you had a salad with your French fries, how big was it?).    But putting your swimming into the equation, it's a very good diet. I'd lay back on the chips and the oreos to be honest. Contradicting your effort in being healthy :).

XHnpraaxaa	Depends on many things.  Some are not sprayed and that makes it better for you.  Some it does not make much difference.  They say it is good to eat organic strawberries or organic celery because these absorb the sprays and this is very bad for us to intake since they cannot be washed off.|`|7iSfizwhaa	The word 'organic' is often mentioned on food labels, but there are varying definitions for it, according to who you talk to.  Generally speaking, California-certified organic is pretty good, as the food manufacturer/grower has to adhere to rigid state strictures in order to get the California Organic stamp on their product.  If you are buying organic, however, the more specific a label is, generally the better quality of 'organicism.'  For example, a really good organic product will usually mention things like "no preservatives," "no artificial colors or additives," " free of pesticide and genetic manipulation," "grown by a natural, sustainable method without use of chemicals/pesticides/genetic tampering," and so on and so forth.    As for the benefits of organic produce:  avoiding chemical contamination and pesticides is always good for you; many organic vegetables and fruits are grown on small privately-owned farms and it is always good to support the "little guy"; and you can also avoid 'Frankenfoods' (genetically altered foods).  Buying organic will also likely avoid other unpleasant additives (wax, herbicides, artificial colorings, preservative sprays, etc. etc. ad nauseam).  A final note to think about is that since it does not keep as long as 'doctored' produce, organic produce cannot be transported very far and so usually comes from the local area or at least within our own country--so by buying organic you are also supporting your local or national economy, rather than some banana republic south of the equator.
NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was theweightlossplace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|ho4skDEdaa	It's related to the blueberry and it grows in regions like the amazon. I find it tasty, but...it's also an expensive product.|`|Gx1CbI56aa	Yes, it's a great natural product. The acai berry is high in anti oxidants and other things. They are a really great way to help augment a solid an exercise and diet program if you are looking to lose weight.    The Acai berry is gaining popularity because of being featured on such TVs shows as The Today Show, Rachael Ray and Oprah. What are some of the other reasons why acai berries are healthy?  They also help combat fatigue and other things. I have been using them for a couple months now and I have noticed a difference. The best bet in my opinion is to take advantage of the free trial bottle offer that many companies selling the acai berry offer that way you can decide if you really like them without having to buy.    Thats what I did and I used them along with a diet and exercise program and it worked for me. I found that the acai berry was very good at curbing my urge to snack which really helped since it can be so easy to blow that workout right out of the water for naught if I gave in to my urges and had that mid afternoon snack.    I got mine from here

v4vQSzu4aa	Most certainly...........Pull out your eggs first and scramble them in a bowl with some salt, pepper and a touch of milk.  Then, get a non-stick pan and saute your mushrooms first on medium high heat (lightly clean them with a damp cloth and slice them) once they are cooked, add in about a TBSP of butter, then turn down your heating coil to medium low, then pour in your eggs.  Using a rubber spatula, start to stir them around until they are half way cooked (no runny/raw looking eggs anymore) then dump in your diced tomatoes and cheese.  Once the moistness has almost cooked out of your eggs, put them onto your plate.  The eggs will not be dry, seeing as they are still cooking on your plate a bit, the veggies, cheese and milk will have kept them somewhat moist and you will have a delicious scrammbled egg plate!  Hope this helps you to enjoy you meal today!|`|OQge8bqYaa	I like to fry the mushrooms in a little butter; then melt the cheese on it.   (This gives you a little crispy brown cheese).

Then pour in the eggs and cook until they are set.|`|ZEkLLFrkaa	cook the mushrooms add the eggs cook til partly done add tomatoes cook til almost done add cheese and melt|`|2r4kfcJmaa	I make scrambled eggs in the microwave.

Microwave for 30 seconds, stir, then microwave for 30 more seconds. Repeat until fully cooked    3. Put cheese on top and microwave for 17 seconds. Stir and enjoy!|`|7af47676fbd4e1c7f4cc47a8c4c33755aa	i would saute the sliced mushrooms first. Take the mushrooms out of the pan, the add a bit of margerine to the pan.  Pour the mixed up eggs to the pan. As the egg starts to set add the mushrooms and tomatoes, stir around a bit. At the end add the cheese and let that cook a while until the cheese starts to melt.|`|M1oorJ62aa	Cut up the mushrooms, put them in a pan with a little butter or oil and cook them for a couple minutes, add in your egg and seasoning and tomato, then add in cheese at the end and melt it throughout or just let it melt ontop :)    Good luck!
YEd9Q5KZaa	Toasted bagel, no way in hell could it not be.   I like Philadelphia cream cheese, specifically Herb and Garlic (I think that is what it's called)  I like to melt cheddar cheese on my bagels and put garlic powder on top and/or tomato sauce.

1wNsBNmxaa	Sauerkraut is finely shredded cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria, including Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus.It has a long shelf-life and a distinctive sour flavor, both of which result from the lactic acid that forms when the bacteria ferment the sugars in the cabbage. It is therefore not to be confused with coleslaw, which receives its acidic taste from vinegar.    D?mon~~?|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Because cabbage stinks.  And it's just pickled cabbage.|`|pqqKLCmwaa	If you can't stand the smell of saurkraut, you prob  don't like the smell of vinegar and cabbage, because that's what it's made of.

Place into a large mixing bowl and set aside.   Place the eggs into an electric kettle and cover with cold water by at least 1-inch. Turn the kettle on. Once the water comes to a boil, the kettle will turn itself off. Leave the eggs in the water for 15 minutes. Remove and peel off the shell. Slice each egg into 8 pieces and set aside.   While the eggs are cooking, fry the bacon and remove to a paper towel to drain, reserving 3 tablespoons of the rendered fat. Crumble the bacon and set aside.   Transfer the fat to a small saucepan set over low heat and whisk in the red wine vinegar, sugar and Dijon mustard. Season with a small pinch each of kosher salt and black pepper.

Crab Stuffed Mushrooms     INGREDIENTS   1 pound fresh mushrooms   7 ounces crabmeat   5 green onions, thinly sliced   1/4 teaspoon dried thyme   1/4 teaspoon dried oregano   1/4 teaspoon ground savory   ground black pepper to taste   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese   1/3 cup mayonnaise   3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese   1/4 teaspoon paprika      DIRECTIONS  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).   In a medium bowl, combine crabmeat, green onions, herbs, and pepper. Mix in mayonnaise and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese until well combined. Refrigerate filling until ready for use.   Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp towel. Remove stems. Spoon out the gills and the base of the stem, making deep cups. Discard gills and stems. Fill the mushroom caps with rounded teaspoonfuls of filling, and place them in an ungreased shallow baking dish. Sprinkle tops with Parmesan and paprika.   Bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and serve immediately    I would also love a Shrimp Bruschetta, Lobster Dip with Baked Pita Chips, Phyllo wrapped seafood with Asparagus, Scallop Kebabs with Mushrooms, Cherry Tomatoes, and Vidalia Onions, Sundried Tomato and Garlic Bread with Blue Crab and last but not lease, Tempura Shrimp with a Spicy Horseradish Sauce. I think all of these compliment the flavors of your Filet and offer a light tasting of what's to come..............an excitement fills the air when you start out with the best (but in a lighter sense) and sets your dinner up to be heavenly, or at least, that's what I think.  I envy you, your family and guests at this dinner, happy cooking to you!|`|1cb16cdd32ac22cebad80bfd38a95941aa	i would do a lobster, shrimp, or crab bisque.  then serve a nice slad with butter lettuce, cherry tomatoes, red onion, real bacon bits, cubed cheese, and a balsamic vinegarette.  i would serve steamed haricot verts and parsley baby red potato with the meat.

We plant corn to feed animals to make crappy sodas to power cars all the stuff we don't need to be doing. Plus on top of that we eat various corn syrups which have no real nutritional value and aren't really that natural I guess other than the fact they are derived from corn. If you want syrup go with maple syrup or make a simple syrup (one part water to one part sugar) it is not made in a laboratory and it is a bit better for ya!

If you are good at taking ingredients and doing some actual COOKING you will spend a lot less on groceries than if you are a chickin voila or hamburger helper type who buys the more expensive "heat and eat" foods.    I shop in the mornings when the meats that have to sell today are marked down and save a LOT by freezing them until I need them, or repackaging the larger portions into smaller ones (make sure you put info on the ziplock that you need to use it asap once it's thawed).    We also have a store here that offers double coupons every day up to $.99 and occasionally offers triple coupons.  I use my store saver cards at all the grocery stores and clip coupons for things I actually use, stock up on pantry items when they're on sale (beans, pasta, canned tomatoes,etc) so that I have them when I need them.

Unless you buy the cheap knockoff version, which i'm pretty sure are faux materials.|`|eLJUouVTaa	Yes you are right.|`|B365rHNAaa	So, do you get upset that because of your morales or because everyone else seems to get upset by this, you absolute sheep|`|p5hvth7zaa	Sorry Idk What uggs are..  but your so cute haha..    "in a nice green pasture with butterflies and rainbows"|`|llkSmgLJaa	Uggs are made from baby lamb skit. Tell them they are wearing the skin from babies. :-(|`|LVDd4Q1Jaa	they shave the sheep  but they are treated horribly and mass transported|`|XXw0xGtTaa	I believe they do use sheep skin but all leather comes from animals. i'm not condoning it btw.|`|3SY0ObRQaa	Don't they use real fur too?  And i think they sheer sheep, not skin them. But obviously the sheep as valuable for their wool and meat. So they will be killed in the end for meat :(    So yes, uggs are cruel|`|4pco9j9Faa	They do skin the sheep, but I'm guessing your friends refuse to accept this because they would rather delude themselves into believing the happy sheep is green pastures than face the fact that something they're doing is wrong. But please, leave them alone about UGGs and about their lifestyles. Over time,. I have learned not to preach or mess with peoples eating habits and ways of life. People are sensitive, and just as you don't want anyone telling you to eat meat, meat-eaters don't like people telling them not to.
RwxJ5IC4aa	black and milds dont really give great flavor, most taste the same whether you purchase apple,wine,creme, etc. They are nice to have once in a while but most who smoke them enjoy the original taste not so much the special flavoring.

Not sure of the cost of Blanton's, but it also is a very good whiskey.|`|46T7owKdaa	I do not like your stance on Canadian whiskey as Windsor would be a good choice in your situation, also another choice could be the knockout taste of the Dirty Bird, Kentucky's own Wild Turkey bourbon whiskey!! If you do not like the Canadian whiskey Wild Turkey is a great choice.
AhO0Uoppaa	eat first and drink slow, if your not used to drinking .People eather get drunk fast or it catches up with them as they drink. And if your worried about a hangover drink water every now and again while your drinking|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Eat something greasy and start slow.  Don't mix different kinds of alcohol until you know your drinking limit from previous experience.  I'd recommend white wine if you're not sure how drunk you'll get.  Wine is the very worst beverage to vomit back up (it burns and red wine makes it look like you're vomiting blood)  Remember, 1 modest glass of wine is equal to one shot or one can of beer.  3/4 of the bottle will get you buzzed but I'm not sure about drunk.  Unless you are a smaller person or are just starting to drink.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	If youre a noob...only stick with one drink like, say, beer. Mixing liquors comes with experience! :-p|`|IHjevhjhaa	Drink slow and the moment you start to get dizzy, stop and enjoy the drunken buzzzzzz|`|46T7owKdaa	Never drink quickly when you are first starting because, as stated before, it will all catch up with you at some point and it is better having it catch up slowly than all at one time and you realize you have drank too much and have no viable contributions to society you can make. Also it is a really good idea to stay hydrated on the side with water or gatorade or something so you will not be murdered the next morning.    HAVE FUN...BUT NOT TOO MUCH FUN!!!!!!|`|I6KsujGpaa	Eat while your drinking and don't mix your dark and light liquors (been there done that) but for someone new to drinking start slow and stay with beer, it has less alcohol by volume and won't hit you as hard in the morning. hope this helps have fun

But if you have been having this problem for more than this one time use, it is especially important to try first admit to a licensed professional or someone you know very personally and trust; use this ability to admit it to gain help from your friends and family to help you- this is the most crucial part- to get over this obstacle and make everything and everyone around you better.

84W8ff0paa	Have you ever tried broiled tofu? It's my tofu fallback plan, for when i can't think of anything else to cook. I put it in pita pockets or on top of pasta, or even just eat it by itself.     Its also delicious cubed in stir-fry, or grilled (although i think its a bit too cold for grilling right now).  To stir fry, i cook it before the veggies and then add it when i add the sauce, since it requires a bit more oil than the veggies. For grilling, just use your favorite marinade and cook it until it looks done.|`|p5hvth7zaa	Mush it and shape into patties  Make Veggie Burgers!    However, my favorite is Soft tofu, cut it into cubes and coat it with all purpose flour.    then you fry it untill its golden..  its Delicious!  Goodluck  =DD|`|bitffZ6kaa	Throw it in the bin and get some meat.|`|b2261d1342601255ca19eb8cac0fdf39aa	I recommend frying it (either deep fat or pan) and get it nice and golden brown and then coating in whatever sauce you might want. I would do a simple hot sauce and vegan margarine sauce (just take both and put into a sauce pan till everything is melted and combined, just like a standard "buffalo wing" sauce but with vegan stuff)    I also reccomend baking it last time I did it I made a marinade basting sauce that included beer, soy sauce, cane sugar, mirin (cooking rice wine) garlic red pepper flakes and ginger. I took the tofu and pressed it (wrap it in towels and then put on a flat surface and put a big pan on top with cans weighing it down) for 20 minutes or so. Then I carefully poked some holes in the tofu and put it in the marinade in a baking dish and put that into a 350 degree oven and bake for 30 minutes or until the tofu is nice a brown and has absorbed some liquid! I also added some big chunks of onion and I served it over some fried rice (take cold cooked rice put it in a wok with earth balance or other vegan margarine and add some of the marinade and more soy sauce and cooked veggies if you got them and stir fry that till the rice is nice and hot then add some sesame seeds)     Happy tofu eating!
AA11173395	Environmental reasons:  According to the U.N. the raising of animals for food is the number one contributor to global warming; it creates more greenhouse gases than all forms of transportation combined.    Health reasons:  Animals in industrial situations are routinely given feed laced with pesticides, and are injected with huge amounts of hormones and antibiotics, and these substances can be found in all cuts of meat.  They have been linked to suppressed immune systems and  certain cancers.  Meat eaters have higher rates of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, colon cancer and all digestive disorders.

So I'd say drink up as often as you can and like.
OVs6rWswaa	Boiling any meat is just plain stupid and lazy. If someone has to boil meat they should not buy it.    Bake your Brisket covered with the fat side down. It needs to reach 190 degrees F internal temp to be tender. Cook it at 250 - 275 F for about 5-6 hours, until the temp gets up there. Then let it sit 20 minutes in the pan covered on the counter before slicing.     I have cooked dozens of briskets. I have awards also.    Good luck|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I like to season mine with a bit of seasoned salt and pepper. Leave that on over night or a couple of hours at least.    Then chop up some onions, garlic and celery and pour in a dark beer.

The best cut of beef i've ever had is rib of beef.  "They" say brisket should be boiled, for how long i don't know - google it.  2 good ways i know of cooking roast beef are 1) putting an onion in the roasting tin and also using it when making the gravy.  2) covering the outside of the beef in mustard,  As for cooking it's preference of how you like your meat, rare, medium, well done. Best to ask your butcher.  1 last tip when making the gravy from the beef juices add some marmite to it, delicious

BWxSSADaaa	Roti is a flat bread from India.  It is similar to a Mexican tortilla, although the tortilla usually includes shortening/fat in the dough and roti does not.  Also, whereas a tortilla is made with white wheat flour usually, roti is traditionally made with atta, a whole wheat flour.  The dough is simply atta and water, sometimes a little salt and oil.  To make the dough into roti, just roll a ball out flat and quite thin, it should have the diameter of a salad plate.  Then this is cooked on a hot griddle (called a tava) until brown spots appear.  Flip and do the same on the other side.  It's important to brush the cooked roti with ghee/melted butter so it's soft and pliable.  And tasty.  :-)    You can use them any way you'd us a tortilla.  In Indian cuisine, they are frequently used to eat curry/dishes with a gravy.  Pieces of bread are torn and used to scoop the sauce and food.|`|762867c9c785bebe44cfcfcc94149f3baa	Roti canai (pronounced "chanai," not "kanai") is a type of flatbread found in Malaysia|`|cLa7nwhcaa	The origin of Roti is a hard question to answer. All food historians agree that Wheat was first cultivated around 5,000 years in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Indus valley. The wheat was made into a paste and cooked over hot stone. In Egypt, they would use the day old paste and mix it into the new dough. Finally they would isolate the yeast and lay the foundation for modern bread.  In Indus valley, archaeological evidencece suggest that they flattened out the stone and later made clay platter that resemble the Tawa where the bread was made on as needed basis. The Roti originated in Indus valley and is the staple food of India and Pakistan.  The Arabs took Roti to South Asia on their trade route. During British Raj, Roti arrived in Africa and West Indies by the workers on the ships.  For traditional Roti, you just mix water and whole-grain wheat flour and make the dough. The dough is flattened out to cookies about 6" diameter and thickness of a quarter. After the bread is cooked on each side for about 90 seconds, it is briefly roasted on a visible flame to naked eye. This puffs up the bread with steam. It is Roti. Roti is a flat un-leavened bread.  There are many variants for flours (Wheat, millet, Corn..) as well cooking methods (Tandoor baking, deep frying, and pan frying).    Answer to your question is : Roti originated in Indus valley about 5,000 years ago. Roti is staple food of India and Pakistan. Roti is a flat un-leavened bread made of whole-grain wheat flour.|`|6izMqiBVaa	Roti is from Pakistan  Naan is from Greece  its flour mixed with water then set on stove|`|UGY3i7BWaa	iTS FROM THE PAKIS.Im sure of it|`|7cUDstdjaa	A lot of crazy answers here.

It is made from a special roti pastry and is then filled with various fillins, usually curry.  Go to the site here and learn all about it.  Yes you would eat it like a Taco or more like a closed Burrito  http://www.tntisland.com/menu.html|`|uJFc9y0Faa	roti is like a flat bread from india. It is delicious and thick. you can eat it like a taco so you can put stuff in it or, more traditionally, you can just tear a piece off and scoop up the side dish to add flavor. Oh, and it is eaten with the hands. :)
l8ddp0F3aa	When you say "pure vanilla," do you mean vanilla bean or liquid vanilla?  If you mean liquid vanilla, then it is still 1 tbsp..  If you mean vanilla bean, then I would guess you would cut a vanilla bean in half crosswise and then split one of the halves down the middle with a knife lengthwise.  Scrape out the seeds with the blade of the knife and add the seeds to your filling.  You will have little black flecks in your cheesecake, though if you use a vanilla bean.      Don't whip the cream first; pour it in as liquid.  It is going to bake as part of the filling and it wouldn't keep its fluff anyway if it were to be whipped then baked.      Good luck! Sounds delicious!|`|fVPV2kVUaa	Just pour the cream into your recipe as a liquid and add about 2 tsp vanilla.|`|TxvhMMSFaa	whip it before you add it

DFXS4SB4aa	Brochen are German hard rolls. It's similar to a French baguette in being a hard crusty bread, but the shape and cultural significance make them quite different. The taste can also differ.|`|EMh3cD7Maa	No, a bagette is more similar.  And, I think you mean brioche?|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Are you trying to ask about BRIOCHE?   If so, then it isn't remotely like French bread.  Brioche is a little sweeter; and the outside is also soft.  It can be done in little rounds, or a big round.  French bread has no sweetness whatsoever; is big and crusty on the outside, yet soft inside.
snBeIxpBaa	Hello, I post in the V&V when I can, simply because I feel a clarification, correction or another view is needed.  (If I have reliable, non-bias sources to back up what I correct)    I personally check V&V section daily.. just because I never know what type of post I'll see.   Some are serious, some are just made to annoy people, others are obvious trolls.. some are clarifications or a rant.  (as with other areas on YA as well.. but this just seems to have a nice balance)      I personally don't believe your diet alone will make you healthier, it is what you eat.. how much you eat, your metabolism and how much you exercise that really makes you healthy.      There are benefits to being a vegetarian/vegan, however not everyone can or will embrace this lifestyle; and to those that don't.. that's fine.  People must have a mutual understanding about a individuals right and choice. (in most cases)|`|doz7RIoeaa	here are my and other reasons::    I own an omni but vegetarian friendly restaurant.

bb8h33w8aa	As far as origins, there really isnt one.  It's just a term for ANY kind of food that makes you feel comforted.    Here's the definition for it:  Comfort food is typically inexpensive, uncomplicated, and easy to prepare. Many people turn to comfort food for familiarity, emotional security, or as a special reward. The reasons a dish becomes a comfort food are diverse but often include pleasant associations of childhood. Small children often seem to latch on to a specific food or drink (in a way similar to a security blanket) and will repeatedly request it in high stress situations. Adults eat comfort food for a sense of continuity.|`|JoOMti26aa	Because they're comforting, simply. They release happy endorphines I suppose.|`|FQ3X9Kdlaa	From your mom's nipple|`|deEs2ta8aa	It's food that comforts you when you feel sad or stressed! Whatever makes you feel waarm and fuzzy inside   Usually it's unhealthy aswell, like ice cream/chocolate/donuts/cookies etc|`|JfVxCDb7aa	They make us "feel" good. If eating a candybar calms you down after an argument, then it could be called a comfort food.|`|AA10625089	Because they are foods that we grew up with and find comforting such as mac and cheese or mashed potatoes and gravy. Stuff your mom or grandma (or other loved one) used to make. Things that bring back fond memories and take you back to a place and time that is happy and comforting.

To bring them to school, keep them in containers and put balls of paper towel, etc, inbetween them in the spaces to stop them from moving, put tooth picks on some of them on top if you are going to wrap plastic wrap over them, but if you have a lid and airtight container thats your best bet.|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	Honestly they probably wont keep|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Make cookies instead.

95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Russian Dressing is almost identical to 1000 Island; it is slightly more like a mix of 1000 Island and French because it's a more reddish color due to the addition of tomato; but, a lot of restaurants use the term Russian and 1000 Island Dressing interchangeably.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	It's called "Russian Dressing" and is similar to the reddish French dressing.  Catalina dressing is also similar|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	KFaulk is partially right, I ama former chef and trained in European and Russian cuisines, it is like thousand island with the addition of sour cream and caviar, and is not use on salad in Russia more of a dressing for other things, the word dressing was bastardized by the US to mean a salad concoction, but it means something else in classical cuisine.    Russian salad is a mix of vegetables, with a mayo dressing on it thinned with tarragon vinegar and garnished with hard cooked eggs and caviar.

The last person to do this drinks.     6- Six is for Dicks  All the guys take a drink     7- Thumbmaster  Whoever pulls a 7 becomes the new Thumbmaster. He or she can sneakily put their thumb on the table whenever they like. All the other players must put theirs on the table, too. The last to do it must drink. Check out this video to see how Thumbmaster is played.     8 - I Never  Say a true statement about something you've never done. All those who have done it must drink.     9 - Rhyme  Say a short sentence. The next player uses a sentence that rhymes with it. This goes around the table til the last person can't think of a rhyme. He or she drinks. (Words can only be used once.)     10- Category   Choose a category. Each player must choose something within that category. If you can't think of anything, you drink. (Example: chocolate candy bars: Snickers, Twix, Reese's Cups, Milky Way, etc.)     Jack- Rule  Possibly the funnest card in the bunch. When you pull a rule card, you get to make up a rule for the game. Every time the rule is broken, that person must drink. (See Rules Game above for some good rule ideas.)     Queen- Question Master  The person who pulls the Q is Question Master until the next Q is pulled. He or she can ask a question of another player at any time. If that player answers the question, he or she must drink.     King- King's Cup  The first three to pull a King must pour some of their drink into the cup at the middle of the table. The last person to choose it must drink it. The game ends when the last King is pulled.     Ace- Waterfall  Everybody drinks. The player who picked the Ace starts the waterfall. No player can stop drinking until the player before him stops.|`|gzaVGE4Qaa	Flip cup!|`|s30Duwdraa	Molson Poker    What you need:  Deck of cards  Shot glass  1, 2 or 3 cases of bottled Beer (depending on how many peeps and how ripped you wanna get)    1) Fill the shot glass with beer and put it in the middle of the table.   Deal 6-10 cards face up around it (depending on how many people are playing).  2) Deal the rest of the cards to the players. Keep the cards face down.  3) Choose someone to go first.  They will flip a card over.  If the card matches a card around the glass, they have to drink the shot.  4) That person has to fill the shot glass with beer for the next person.  BUUUUT there are rules to follow.  You cannot:  - Spill any beer  - Touch the bottle to the shot glass  - Swear on your turn  - Burp on your turn  If you do any of these things, you have to drink the shot and try again...

You all give yourself names of vegetables (it doesnt have to be vegetables it could be anything really). Then you cover you teeth with your lips and go round the group saying each others name. For example if you were zucchini and another mushroom, you say 'zucchini zucchini calling mushroom mushroom'.   The idea of the game is to not show your teeth which is really hard as the everyone sounds stupid and the minute you laugh your teeth show. thats when you take a shot. The idea is to go as fast as possible and if someone gets the name wrong or hesitates you take a shot then too.    Hope you like it!!
ZSyyTjokaa	Actually, cola syrup  (not necessarily Coca Cola)  is often prescribed by doctors as a remedy for nausea.  It's available over-the-counter at any pharmacy.  So  Coke   (or Pepsi or whatever)  does contain an actual  nausea remedy.    As for ginger ale:  "traditional"   ginger  ale is made from actual ginger root or ginger extract. Ginger is widely known as an anti-emetic  (basically, an anti-puking agent), and will counteract or cure motion sickness.  However, most modern ginger ales only contain ginger flavorings,  and no actual ginger. So,  the calming effect on your stomach is brought on only by the carbonation,  which relieves irritation in the stomach.    Which, by the way,  is what plain club soda/seltzer does, too.|`|WseLyvSpaa	A lot of Ginger ale doesn't have real ginger in it.    I know people who claim that any soda is a good relief for their indigestion.  Something about the carbonation...maybe it eases the release of gases...settles down the stomach.  But, soda pop is acidic, not alkali.  About pH = 3 because of the phosphoric acid.  It never did it for me.    IMO, for acid stomach, nothing beats Sodium Bicarbonate...baking soda dissolved in a cup of water.  Be prepared to release the CO2.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	It has nothing to do with the bubbles. In fact, when giving soda for the stomach, you are supposed to "stir out" the bubbles first. The reason is has been oft recommended by doctors is because when one has diarrhea and/or vomiting due to a gastrointestinal infection, the intestines actually require caloric intake in order to heal. Giving soda is a good way to get calories from the sugar when food cannot be tolerated by an upset stomach. Somehow people have translated over the years for that to mean that drinking soda can settle an upset stomach. Ginger ale has been recommended becasue not only does it have the necessary sugar, but ginger can help relieve the nausea. I have never hear cola recommended (it is usually clear sodas) so that may have translated over the years as well, or be particular to some families or geographic regions.|`|UmejCKkHaa	they have some alkalis in them  im guessing.    and if your stomach is upset you take antacids, and maybe an ingredient from both of these is in ginger ale and cola?    thats an educated guess|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Ginger ale is good for your stomach mainly because of ginger root that is an ingredient in the ginger ale. Ginger helps to reduce nausea and vomiting. Plus, it is a clear liquid that tends to settle the stomach.    That said, cola wouldn't be any different than any other soda.. it is specifically ginger ale that is good for an upset stomach. The Coca-Cola company probably started the rumor that cola was good too.

Sorry to go on and on, but I have had a lot of emotional trouble with family and alcohol and if you keep doing this, it will just get worse and you will feel like you need more and more to get that buzz.|`|uZEmRPBFaa	Do it while you are young.|`|5dce638cf6d8ba7dbcb797e4f03c4f5baa	I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  I'm 24 too.  I have 2 jobs and after a long day, I like to toss back a few with my friends.  Or even by myself.  I have at least 1 a night most of the time.  There's really nothing else in my fridge but beer, ketchup and a jar of salsa con queso.  The important thing is to know your limits and don't go driving around when you've had too many.  I'm sure you're smart enough to know that.  But I wouldn't say there is anything wrong with drinking that much.  You're young.  Have a good time.  Enjoy yourself.  You can worry about your liver later.  And if your ever in the Chicagoland area, let me know.  We can have a few together.|`|9f1815216915b904efd9e933b1a5b03aaa	Beer is God's way of letting us know that he loves us and that he wants us to be happy.
oS09Pzz1aa	u can use a steamer but if u want in a pot so u can put it in boiling water and just after 3 to 4 minutes drain it and then add flavors.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Use the steam, add some salt, a sprinkle of mrs dash if you like that or I also add lemon peel to mine sometimes.    A flavored sea salt in the water may help ad flavor as well. Like a cirtus sea salt, or a smoked one etc...|`|F2ugW4cRaa	I normally steam mine in a steamer over the potatoes, sprinkles with garlic salt, and serve with garlic butter.|`|zsXT62Z9aa	It's really a 2 part process.  First you steam the broccoli, then you saute it in a pan.    First, put about 3/4 inch of water in the bottom of a saucepan.  Add a little salt and bring to a rolling boil.  Add the broccoli - I usually cut it off the stalk into chunks.  Boil for 3-4 minutes, or until you put a fork through the stalks and the fork goes through easily.  Don't over boil it, or the broccoli will be mushy.  Drain.    In a large saute pan, add 2-3 Tbsp of butter and melt it over medium heat.  Add 2 to 4 Tbsp of finely chopped onion, and 2 cloves of garlic, finely minced.  Saute for 2-3 minutes, then add the broccoli and continue to saute for another minute or so.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, or even some seasoned salt if you want.    Serve immediately.
hHCdXq0Naa	Lots of FAKE Cheese Dust and no texture at all.  I hate to bite into something and have the dust fly in my face, or all over my hands.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	As a former chef and having only used a crank style once, the rock salt does not melt the ice so fast and it lowers the temperature slower to help freeze it slower, but if you have only table salt make sure the ice is not finely crushed so it does not melt to fast.|`|zsXT62Z9aa	Yes, it doesn't work the same.  You need the salt to remain whole, and not dissolve.  Rock salt is huge chunks of salt, and to make ice cream, you need huge chunks.  I suppose you could try regular table salt.  But I'm not sure it would work.

8gDF8nlgaa	quick chocolate milk shake:  Pint of milk  2 big spoons of vanilla ice cream  2 tbsp hot chocolate powder    Stick in blender for 30 secs  serve|`|WngxQDiaaa	Milkshake?      Chocolate milkshake:  Vanilla icecream  Choclate sauce  small amount of milk    Put in a blender until smooth    If you prefer a fruit such as strawberrys or raspberrys or blueberrys then add that instead of the chocolate.|`|g8SnOqscaa	Well that depends on:  what kind you want?  Indulgent or simple?  Fruity or chocolaty?    Use ingredients like cocoa powder, hot chocolate powder, milk (obv), sugar or sweetner, ice cream, fruits/fruit purees, melted chocolate etc.    You can also make a really thick shake by adding a small % of cornflour to the final mix.    You need a blender (or a hand blender will do) and a nice tall glass!  Try not to incorporate a lot of air as you will just end up with tonnes of froth and little flavoured milk.    ENJOY! :)
RaV7SidDaa	What about those lunchable things?    Fruit is very healthy,, why not cut up fruit and make a fruit salad    and maybe add a flavored yogurt and mix the fruit and yogurt together    Also low fat granola is very healthy,,|`|F2ugW4cRaa	My first suggestion is to explore what else you can put into your sandwiches.  This would be my ultimate sandwich.  Egg Sandwich  (by Dune  6/2/09)  I Egg. (boiled, semi soft)  2 Slices of bread. (regular white optional)  Spread.  Snipped Chives or the green of spring onions.  (i) Boil the egg until the yolk is not quite set. Cut egg in half and scoop out the egg. Season with S&P (a little curry powder optional) and mash.  (ii) Spread bread with butter or margarine, then spread over the egg.  (iii) Sprinkle with the chives or spring onions, cover with the second slice of bread an cut into fingers or triangles.  If you get the egg cooked just right you will have a perfect moist sandwich that isnt soggy, and will have a distinctive yolky taste.    Fresh Fruit  Lettuce Salads  Pasta Salads  Rice Salads etc are good old stand-bys with some deli-meats.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I give my daughter sandwiches (duh) but sometimes I will roll up deli meat and cheese and give it with crackers. I also give her lunchables (same idea). They also sell a thermos that is more like a bowl and in that you can take leftovers, soup, any canned food (spaghettios, etc) just heat it up in the morning and seal it in the container. Other ideas are salad with chicken (better if you keep all ingredients separate), fruit salad with yogurt....I cant think of anymore. Good luck!|`|WngxQDiaaa	Wraps, Salad, Crackers and cheese, Tuna w/triscuits or other crackers|`|6Xbz5AOlaa	http://www.aces.edu/pubs/speng/safelunc....    look at that for ideas and look at this http://nutrition.about.com/od/nutritionf...    make sure ur packed lunch includes things like fruit/dried fruit and instead of a boring sandwoich maybe go for a nice fresh bap stuffed with ur favourite stuffing like a salad egg mayonaise or anything!!     EXPLORE THE FOOD!|`|R59NNcjRaa	How about some pre-cooked turkey burgers. Or even ceaser salad with roasted veggies or those pizza bagels.|`|g8SnOqscaa	Pasta Salad:    Pasta  Salad Onions  Sweetcorn  Peas  Tomaotes  Chicken Pieces/Other meat  Dollop of Mayo    Rice Salad:  Rice  Peas  Sweetcorn  Peppers  Sweet Chilli Sauce    A nice salad|`|AA11261571	Gotta love the rice omelet.    -Cooked white rice (however much you want.  Leftover rice can be used for ANYTHING.)  -Whisk 2 eggs with salt (NO MILK) and make a plain flat omelet (set aside)  -Take about 3/4 to 1 cup cooked rice and heat it in the skillet.  Add about 2 TBSP ketchup to the rice and stir quickly.  Don't drown the rice and make it soggy, just flavor it.  -Wrap the flavored rice in the egg.    Nice variations could involve meat/veggies in the rice.  Personally, I like chicken and zukes.
hCBQ60A5aa	err.....probably actually kinda low!    although, these kinda situations...it's more likely that one of the invited people will let slip to one of the not-invited people that is happening...  ...though, my advice would be, if it's a really fun party worth having than you shouldn't actively not inivte someone.  if there are any bad feelings towards you're party than there'll be people who'll have bad feelings....  ...as opposed to the alternative of EVERYONE having a buzzin' night, y'kno?    :)        hope i helped!|`|cjKPEHaFaa	Just don't use Facebook to organize it!  Use the telephone like in the olden days.|`|FQ3X9Kdlaa	Very high considering it's become popular for people to use those sites to arrange meetings for the sole purpose of setting someone up to get the crap beat out of them.    I hope it keeps happening so it can bite facebook in the *** and have social networking websites like that removed from existence.    If a few people get hurt along the way, oh well, you shouldn't have been so stupid in the first place.|`|Mr9JDDA8aa	Posting an event on Facebook is like printing out a flyer and having someone who got invited pass it on to the rest of people YOU didn't invite...I suggest you tell them personally.
Q59mF95vaa	It's fine. The sugar just has to melt, so place it in a bowl of hot water to let it melt. I wouldn't recommend putting it in the microwave, since it can destroy the health benefits of it. Crystallization is the sign of good honey.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Honey is one of the few foods that never goes bad. Unfortunately, I do not know how to soften it. Can you just scrape it out and then it will probably melt into whatever you are using it for (tea, etc)? Good luck!|`|AA10276889	Your honey lasts forever. microwaving is best...but make sure the container is glass.  I put a plastic bottle of honey in the mico and warped the whole bottle in just a few seconds, and the honey was still crystallized!    Now I put the plastic ones in hot water and put in on LOW heat on the stove it takes a little longer but no more ruined containers.|`|uOHf7rSlaa	Just put it in the microwave to soften it.  About 1-1.5 minutes will do the trick depending on how crystalized it is.      It's best to put in a plastic wrap covered glass bowl if you can get it out of the bottle.|`|g8SnOqscaa	DONT put it in the microwave.  The honey could become very very hot and cause a serious burn. Also im guessing it's in a glass jar? Not the best material to heat up.    Just gently warm it over a bowl of hot water whist stirring. It's perfectly fine to eat/use even with the crystals.|`|oS09Pzz1aa	you can use it . do not use microwave and do not put it directly on stove .put your jar in a boiling water pan and wait for a while your honey will be soft.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Honey is one of those few things that will never go bad.    It is just fine.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	You can nuke it in short bursts an stir from time to time.  Make sure you have a saucer at hand to put the spoon on, unless you have MW safe stirrers|`|WngxQDiaaa	Its perfectly fine.  Just put it in the microwave for about 10 seconds.

6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Flour was typically ground in gristmills.    (a mill that wheat growers brought their wheat to have it ground).    Gristmills were dangerous places back then.     Turns out that grinding flour by stone creates a very dry and dusty area.    It was not uncommon for these mills to catch fire and even explode from the dust in the air.    Molasses is a product of sugar making.    It is the leftover syrup.   There are also different degrees of molasses (like black strap).    Lastly, the yeast for the bread was wild yeasts in a starter that they kept alive (we know this as sour dough bread).    They would use leftover dough from each day to make the next days bread.|`|NLKVrdIKaa	The molasses were made from cane juice carefully boiled down to the consistency of syrup with very small amounts of sulfur in the process.The yeast was kept as raw dough from the previous batch of bread in a continuing process.|`|6d461f9d3d9b1e07b249bea91e8bfb01aa	They made flour by grinding wheat.  All you need to make bread is flour, water and yeast.
SQxiGhz5aa	It depends on the product, how much of the product, and what you are doing to it.    See info: http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/HS/HS2...    Other info here:  http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?...
1b046b18d13bc7d55ab96486cdb346f4aa	Taco salad is easy and healthy. Use 1 pound lean beef. Brown it and season it with taco seasoning or sauce. Maybe add a can of black beans (drain and rinse them first). Use romaine lettuce or some kind of mixed lettuce. Baby spinach leaves are good to mix in. Throw it all together and use some light or fat free ranch dressing. My husband likes to use only a small bit of fat free ranch and then add pace salsa to it.     Also pretty easy is honey mustard chicken. Use boneless skinless chicken breasts. Make a sauce of 1/4 cup Dijon mustard, 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 tsp dried dill weed. Brush that over the chicken and then cook them on the stove top or in the oven on a cookie sheet. Just turn them every 5 minutes or so.     Brown rice is a great easy side dish. It tells you on the bag how to cook it. I add one chicken bullion cube for every cup of rice. It has great flavor.     Good luck!|`|DIxbib1paa	Green beans, boiled potatos, plum tomatos, black olives, tin of tuna, chopped garlic, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, mix, eat, delicious!|`|6vyWV0R6aa	do a salad here are the ingridients   green cabbage, cilantro, parsley, cucumbers every thing needs to be chopped the cucumber you may cut them in cubes , and a tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon of  yellow lemon juice you put the veggies in a salad container then you mix the oil with the lemon and spread it all around the salad and you mix it all together and you have YUMMY AND VERY HEALTHY SALAD the recipe i gave you feeds 4-6 persons but if you need to do for more people then double the oil and lemon as well as the veggies hope you like it
0hmB4QE8aa	Seeing you put in milk and cream and raw meat, I would say no. Its a long time for all that to be combined together and getting room temperature.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	Yes it will be safe to eat, just make sure you cook everything thoroughly.|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	Nope throw them out|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	Me? Nope, I wouldn't touch it. Start over before you ALL get sick!!|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Go ahead and turn it on and cook it.  If it's too close to dinnertime, send out for pizza and reheat the chops for tomorrow's dinner.  I don't have to tell ya to refrigerate 'em overnight after cooking, do I?|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	Yikes....I would maybe go by how cold they were when you put them in.   Although four hours is a long time.  It's better to be safe than sorry and maybe just chuck them out.   Thankfully pork chops aren't too expensive.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Toss it, hun. Just isn't worth it.....|`|6d461f9d3d9b1e07b249bea91e8bfb01aa	Throw it away.  It is not safe to eat.|`|7fXvdwPZaa	I guess it depends on if the pork chops were frozen when you put them in the crock pot.  If they were, it is most likely fine to go ahead and cook them.  If they were thawed and just cold from the frig, then throw them away.
