20090131202045AAQeYYx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is this normal for a 2 month old?	My son will be 2 months old tomorrow. For the last 3 days, he has been struggling to poop. We had issues with gas and constipation when he was just a few weeks old and he needed a suppository to help him go, when he hadn't gone more than skid marks in days, and was screaming in pain to pass a stool. The suppository took 2 hours to work.      Anyway, he is exclusively breastfed and has been struggling to poop for 3 days now. He will grunt, push and scream in pain for more than 2 hours before he is able to finally pass the movement. He cannot settle to sleep for more than 10 minutes, before he wakes up screaming.      Last night we had to help him pass his stool by using vaseline and a q-tip. We do not want to continue to do this.      His stool is very thick and frothy, almost like a thick milkshake. It has taken him 20 minutes to complete passing the stool, and once he does, he settles right down for the night.      Is such a thick stool normal for an exclusively breastfed 2 month old? Is it normal to struggle to pass a stool? Is there anything we can do to help him pass these stools more easily?      Please do not suggest fruit juices, prune juice or water..he is 2 months old, WAY too young for any of that.      Thank you.

20090131093616AAk0Tb1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How can I make the best out of this situation? will choose best answer?	I'd like to get some advice, here's my situation: I am 28 wks pregnant, 23 years old, a senior undergrad. I've been in a relationship with baby's dad for 3 yrs now, and we really do love and care about each other, and are both very excited about the baby.    Here's the problem: he has barely been making money lately - he was doing well before but for months now hasn't been able to close a deal (he's in real estate). He doesn't have a regular job either as he keeps thinking that his business efforts will soon pay off. It's been about 5 months now that he's made pretty much nothing and I keep hearing the same reasons and reassurances that by the time the baby arrives we'll have everything we need. He isn't involved in any crazy stuff (like drinking, gambling, etc.) but I really think he's not realistc and living on a different planet. I am just entering the 3rd trimester and we haven't gotten a place yet (we don't live together currently), haven't gotten anything for the baby (such as baby clothes, and even furniture). I am in school and don't work (as I trusted his words that he'll provide for us). Now I'm thinking about being a single mom cause even though he says he is there for me, not being able to provide for his daughter makes me so angry at him. I've lived in the US for 5 years only and don't have any family here, so he is my only support system right now.   I just don't know what to do as I feel I won't be able to make it as a parent at all and feel so stressed out and guilty all the time.   Any advice will be appreciated, please no insulting or mean comments.

20090131094103AAZVSoK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How to tell your significant other that you dislike the name he picked out for your child?	My fiancé and I have been trying to choose a middle name for our son, who is due to be born in March. My fiancé's name is Xavier de Jesus (Jesus being his father's name and "de" meaning "of"). He is fully Hispanic and speaks both English and Spanish fluently. I, on the otherhand, have no Hispanic background and speak pretty much NO Spanish whatsoever. Xavier wants to name our son Gavin de Xavier. I don't like the way it sounds when I say it and I don't want to look like an idiot when someone asks me what my son's name is and I can't properly pronounce it. I wouldn't mind naming our son Gavin Xavier (without the "de"). I guess I didn't show much enthusiasm when Xavier mentioned his idea because he got upset and mopey and said "You can just change it" with a pitiful look on his face. I told him that I wasn't going to, but I really and truly do not like it. He said that he thinks his dad would like it if we named our son that, but he should already be happy that our son is carrying on his last name, right?(secondary ?) I don't know how to tell him that I do not like the name he has chosen... I'm sorry this ended up being so long.

20090131150200AArF0Qs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	MASTITIS OR FLU????????????	I woke up this morning with a clogged milk duct and neither of my girls were wanting to nurse. So I took a hot shower and massaged in there, hoping to get unclogged. I stayed in for about 30min, maybe more but it wasn't working. During the shower I started to get chills and couldn't get warm...we still had plenty of hot water, but it didn't keep me warm. I started to get very dizzy, so I got out and laid down. My temperature at this time was normal, but I still couldn't get warm. Went to sleep and woke up with a temperature of 101.4. Drank water and nursed for a few minutes throughout the day. At it's highest, my temperature was 103.9. My milk duct is finally unclogged, but still sore.       Hubby had the flu last week and he's still recovering. My symptoms are very similar to his. So I'm not sure if I've got the flu or mastitis.      What are the remedies for mastitis? Or does it just have to work it's way through my system?

20090131150540AARczDt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it okay to leave a six year old in the car by herself for a few minutes?	I know that you aren't supposed to leave kids in the car, but what are you supposed to do when they are sound asleep in the backseat? This afternoon I picked up my little sister from a friend's house, and she zonked out in the backseat. I had to stop at an art store on the way home, and she looked so peaceful I didn't want to wake her up. I just went into the store, got the supplies I needed and came right back out. I parked right in front of the store, and I kept looking out the window. We live in LA and it's 72 degrees today, and I kept a window cracked. And this was in Brentwood, which is a really nice area.       Do you think what I did was okay? Normally, I would have just gone home, dropped her off and then gone to the store, but I have a project due on Monday and it would have been a serious backtrack.      Please don't attack me for asking this. I'm 17. I don't normally drive them. I just don't know if what I did was okay.

20090131145122AAjvcII	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is talking on myspace considered dating?	I've known this guy for a few years,we met through a mutual friend.We see each other about 3 times a year now,cause he lives 45 minutes away.My parents have met him too.They don't know him very well,though.I recently found his profile on myspace through our friend's page and sent this guy a friend request,which he accepted.We've been talking quite a bit on myspace the past week or so,sending messages back and forth.And he asked me for my cell phone number,but I don't have one so I gave him my home phone number and he gave me his,too.Today he said in his message that if I ever want to talk to just call him.We're just friends though.      The problem is that my parents are pretty strict,and don't want me dating for a while,since I'm barely even 15.This guy is 18.I don't think anything of it,since I know we're just friends,that's it.But I'm afraid my parents will start getting suspicious if they know that we're e-mailing a lot and have exchanged numbers.My mom has even said before that she didn't want me talking to guys on the phone a lot.They know he's my friend on myspace,though,and they don't seem to mind.And we've been talking about hanging out sometime,since we're friends with some of the same people,and he's friends with my little brother on myspace,too.So we would never be alone together,though I guess we are when we talk to each other online.Which is why I'm wondering if e-mailing on myspace is considered dating.      And,no,we're not talking about anything questionable.It's all been pretty innocent,and I'm sure it's gonna stay that way.We both come from very religious families,so I don't think he'll try anything.I'm just afraid my parents will start getting suspicious,though there's absolutely no reason to be.What should I do?      Sorry this is so long,I just don't want to get in trouble with my parents when I'm not even doing anything wrong.

She is really wearing my husband and I out with her horrible sleeping habits. She has always been a wakeful girl, getting up at 6...but it has recently gotten worse and worse.      We put her to bed at 7:00pm every night, we have a good routine and that is usually the easy part. She goes to bed quite smoothly.       It doesn't get bad until around 3:00am...she decides its time to wake up and start the day and she will NOT go back to sleep. She is totally alert, running around, playing, turning on the tv, yelling, and asking for breakfast. She never wakes up still sleepy either.       She goes all day long without a nap too.       Weve experimented putting her to bed later, shutting the door to her room, setting an alarm, trying to make her bed more comfortable....but it doesnt seem to change anything.      Can anyone help? Any ideas?       Thankyou.       We are so tired and just want to wake up at 7-8 am.

My mother was very obsessed with me, and it pushed me too hard as a child. By the age of 4, I wrote in cursive, and was working on time tables. Now as a mother of a 3-yr old, I don't want to be as structured and crazy about teaching a child. So I have not pressured her to learn as fast.      Now that she will be 4 in August, and she is showing interests in reading, I want to teach her the Alphabet and Numbers. She seems to not catch on at all. So, I figure that the average ABC song is not doing it. I went to Border's and picked up some really colorful Dr. Seuss flashcards, and she is not catching on even with the rewards system. I need help and lots of suggestions!!! I'm not pushing her to read just yet, but I will like for her to know the Alphabet so that we can move in that direction. PLEASE HELPP!!

So if you found out your teen-age daughter had started taking birthcontrol pills, how would you feel?  I personally would be really upset. And not so much with her but with the person who gave it to her.I just found out that they can get them without parental consent which I think is very wrong.   I have no objection on places giving out condoms, those protect from std's and pregnancy but with a pill only you will catch something sooner or later.   I'm not really against girls being on bc pills but not without their parents knowing about it..

20090131151132AATTAXz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is it weird that an 18 year old guy is talking to a 15 year old girl online,if they know each other?	I've known this guy for a few years,we met through a mutual friend.We see each other about 3 times a year now,cause he lives 45 minutes away.My parents have met him too.They don't know him very well,though.I recently found his profile on myspace through our friend's page and sent this guy a friend request,which he accepted.We've been talking quite a bit on myspace the past week or so,sending messages back and forth.And he asked me for my cell phone number,but I don't have one so I gave him my home phone number and he gave me his,too.Today he said in his message that if I ever want to talk to just call him.We're just friends though.    The problem is that my parents are pretty strict,and don't want me dating for a while,since I'm barely even 15.This guy is 18.I don't think anything of it,since I know we're just friends,that's it.But I'm afraid my parents will start getting suspicious if they know that we're e-mailing a lot and have exchanged numbers.My mom has even said before that she didn't want me talking to guys on the phone a lot.They know he's my friend on myspace,though,and they don't seem to mind.And we've been talking about hanging out sometime,since we're friends with some of the same people,and he's friends with my little brother on myspace,too.So we would never be alone together,though I guess we are when we talk to each other online.Which is why I'm wondering if e-mailing on myspace is considered dating.    And,no,we're not talking about anything questionable.It's all been pretty innocent,and I'm sure it's gonna stay that way.We both come from very religious families,so I don't think he'll try anything.I'm just afraid my parents will start getting suspicious,though there's absolutely no reason to be.What should I do?    Sorry this is so long,I just don't want to get in trouble with my parents when I'm not even doing anything wrong.

My 7m old son is cutting 2 teeth at the moment - the result of which is him having what seems like endless dirty nappies - he now goes in the middle of the night - at least once if not more!      Problem is, despite not even lifting him out of the cot to change him, he is wide awake & wants to play & it takes ages to settle him afterwards - I'm a wreck!      Is there any way to change a nappy without making him so awake? I obviously can't leave him like that.      I have just bought some ashton & parsons from boots (they had run out) I am hoping that will help.      If anyone has any tips I'd be grateful - up until now he's never had dirty nappies at night so I've no experience here!      Thanks

Delany Genevieve   Evyn Delany      Delany and Genevieve are family names. I think Genevieve is too long for a first name, as our last name is already pretty long, so we came up with Evyn as a very loose derivation of Genevieve.      Big Brothers are Camden Robert and Palmer Francis (middle names are family names).      Also, our last name sounds (is) Hispanic, but we are not. If that makes a difference.

It was proven in a court of law that the MMR caused it.      http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-k...    This is interesting because another case (which is in appeals) just ruled against the autistic parents.  That case got all kinds of publicity and everyone was saying it means the end of the vaccine autism debate, but then this case, which is getting little attention from the media, says the opposite.        Do you think that vaccines have to do with autism?  Does this case convince you there might be a link?  Also, how do you explain ingredients like formaldhyde and aluminum in vaccines?  Do you think that could be what is causing it as well as mercury?

20090226083428AA9b3Cv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How do I handle my child's personal hygiene issues?	I am having (practically) the same argument with my  daughter about her hygiene, and its driving me crazy.      For example, yesterday, I told her to get ready for bed, followed by "Brush your hair, teeth put on clean pjs lay out your clothes".  A few minutes later she is in pjs so I ask if she has finished in the bathroom and is ready for bed.  She says yes  so I go to get ready...her toothbrush is as dry as mine (so I know she hasn't brushed)..and it begins.. I tell her to go brush..she says she has...and you can predict the rest..       Its not just brushing her teeth--its everything!  Getting dressed today same thing:  those don't match...didn't you wear those yesterday...wear a bra...did you put on deodorant..brush your hair!!!  She tells me I'm mean (or some variant), I tell her she needs to listen (etc).. both end up frustrated,  late and the car ride is silent and brooding.         I know I'm the parent and that this is a stage; I just don't know how to navigate through this without the fight. She's 10, and I shouldn't have to tell her to brush her hair (etc) and certainly shouldn't be met with anger for it (what 10 yo lies about brushing her teeth for crying out loud!)  I also know this calls for discipline (not the spanking/taking away privileges/punishing type), but the doing this everyday no matter what  variety; and I am open to suggestions.

20090131160822AAXYAgY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Abortion???????????????	Ok, I think abortion is out of control no one wants to even consider adoption anymore, and if a child is born and the father doesn't want it then he is stuck, but if the mother wants an abortion the father has no say? I think that is very unfair. Do you think there should be a system set up for abortions? Like the woman has to go in front of the courts and present her situation and why she wants an abortion? (like after a certain point in the pregnancy) that way the father could present his case too and fight for his child's life? I see a lot of people using abortion as a form of birth control because they wanted to have sex and don't want to deal with the out come of it, now rape and a medical condition is a whole other story that should be an exception. But people think they can just have sex and get an abortion if they become pregnant. I know its the woman's body but if the guy want the kid then he should have a say it weather she can have an abortion or not. Each person can make a statement of why they want one or don't that way both parents have a say in if their child lives or dies. Im not saying woman cant decide all im saying is that the father should have a say as well, after all its his too.

This is my last opportunity to ask any personal questions before polling starts, so I thought I'd let you have a look at my names.    PRONUNCIATION  Clara = KLAH-ruh  Lisette = luh-SETT  Madelina = madd-uh-LAY-nah    MIDDLE NAMES  The different middle names represent names my husband and I came up with independently and mildly disagree on or can't make up our minds. Middle names are reasonably important, as in we will be using them frequently and making them a part of our children's identities.     Amanda, Anna, Daisy, Lily, Rose, Violet, Jack and Andrew are names of loved ones who all adore their names, so you might want to bear in mind these are real people when answering. Elizabeth is my own name; I don't think there's any need for special treatment there.    Our surname is a rare Anglo-Saxon name that starts with S, ends with N, and has a hard K sound in the middle. It sounds similar to Saladin or Salkatin.    http://www.babynames.com/namelist/967398...

20090131163102AA5rlFP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My ex wants to be a father figure to my son?	I have a 2 month old son and his father only comes around maybe once every two weeks. When he comes he is awake for about 2 hours then goes to sleep and when he finally does wake up he leaves. My ex curtis and i dated when we were younger and i just spoke to him today and he tells me if my son's biological father wont be around to support him he said he will. i don't want curtis to do that because i feel like that's not his child and he shouldn't have to do that. curtis also mentioned to me that if i didn't get pregnant by my son's father (my current "boyfriend". things are going so well with him) he said that my son would have been his. i know he still has feelings for me and i don't know if he is trying to get close to my son just to get close to me or if he really means it. i know you really wont be able to tell me if this is true or not but i would appreciate if you could just tell me your opinions from what i just told you. am i wrong for thinking something is up?  thanks.
20090131154055AAtZUBq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Tips on becoming a good babysitter? ?	Okay, I'd love to do some babysitting, but my problem is that I'm short. My height makes me look really young and even though families know my actual age, they probably think the age is young due to my height.       I just want people to know that I am reliable, and I will look after their kids well. A babysitting course is an option..      I already run around after them all at church, and even go to a house to watch a boy while his mother makes dinner..etc.       Are there any ways to make myself known as a good babysitter? I don't mean all over town, just so that peoploe will know I'm responsible.      Thanks heaps in advance :)

20090131152852AAdNjUR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant and bathroom had a leak, ceiling fell...?	To make a long story short..we had a leak in our bathroom, after 2 days the ceiling fell down..a handyman for the apartment was supposed to fix it but acted like the leak wouldn't cause any harm. I'm pregnant..and I don't know if there's any harm associated with this. Like chemicals that may be in the ceiling or debris or mold..I havent seen anything odd just wood and such. I haven't wanted to touch it or clean it because of the baby's health..and been trying to get my boyfriend to do it. My question is does anyone know if there's a risk to my baby? I've been feeling more ill lately..but I'm not sure if maybe it's just being pregnant. I'm in my first trimester.    also, the handyman finally fixed the leak but there's still a big chunk of the ceiling gone.

I took the "1st Response" pregnancy test on the 7th day, and it said "negative".      I decided to wait another week, and if my period didn't come, i'll test again.      Yesterday I spotted a little bit, it was a brownish color just a couple times, then nothing...i figured my period was coming.      Then today I spotted a little again this morning the same brownish color, but i've waited all day, and nothing else has came out...      So can spotting be considered a period? Or is spotting normal when pregnant?

I started noticing some wierd red little bumps on his arms and legs, but they got really concentrated, bigger and red on his face since yesterday. He's been running slight fevers. He's always had a little red mark that comes and goes between his eyebrows (a birthmark?) now that area is the reddest on his whole face.   The doctor said "looks like eczema maybe and put hydrocortisone on it". ( I will be switching doctors)  Does this sound like eczema or a result of his being sick or allergic to the extra juice in his diet lately?   \Thanks, any help appreciated!!

20090131160025AAHkNoV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Mommies you HAVE to help me with this one PLEASE !?	Is it me or does it seem like whether your childs father is in your life or not, most of the time it seems like you're ALWAYS with the baby? I don't mind spending time with my son, he's a great little companion. BUT sometimes I want time to myself. It seems like my fiance does what he wants when we wants. He goes and hangs out with his friends whenever he wants and leaves me with the baby. He's ridiculously lazy ! He's not working at the moment ... I feel like he could at least offer to help out with things around the house. But does he? Of course not. I'm so overwhelmed. For example, today we both wanted to go to the gym to do some working out. Then we realized that no one was available to watch the baby for us (he's sick so we didn't wanna just leave him with ANY body because he gets very cranky) . In the back of my mind, I figured it would be fair if we just BOTH stay home... but guess who up & left and left me with the baby? My sweet sweet fiance . His excuse? "You went to your cousins house the other day when it was your night" ( we take turns with the baby at night AND I got home in time to change the baby and put him to bed and do everything I'm supposed to do) but mind you, he went out last night to hang out with his friends and came home 3 in the morning. His other excuse? " But last night was your night so that doesn't even count" I'm sure we all know how stressful it is to be left alone with a sick baby. Its just not fair at all; especially since this morning I did laundry, cleaned the house AND mixed the babys formula for him (it was his turn to do it) I feel so unappreciated and I really want to teach him a lesson. He needs to learn how to appreciate me and not take me for granted. I'm a good woman, I do everything for him . I was thinking about being spiteful and not cooking, cleaning or finishing his laundry... What should I do to get him to understand that I'm only human and I can only do so much?I want him to offer to help out sometimes, or even do little sweet things to show me he appreciates me and that he cares.  I tried to talk to him, but he SWEARS I'm the one not being fair. If he's right & I'm not being fair, let me know, I don't mind 'constructive criticism'.

I'd like to do things naturally and i know i'm not going to be "purt" again.     I'd like to hear your stories how long you breast fed for, if you got good results and bra sizes too.
20090131163635AA65jQZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Does love ever really fail in the end?	Okay, so I wrote a poem, "Love Never Fails". It's basically something I wanted to do because I was bored. What do you think of it? All suggestions and comments are welcomed!       Love Never Fails (title)      I remember those mornings,   Gazing into the mirror –   Wondering if I was beautiful enough,   To steal your attention away for a moment.      I remember those mornings,   Taking my seat next to you –   Trying to stay calm,   But nervously shaking within my soul.       I remember those mornings,   Feeling like a failure –   Because I let you slip away again,    Without leaving a piece of myself with you.      I remember,   Thinking that love always fails –   But I innocently looked over the truth,   Because love never fails in the end.      I remember those afternoons,   Peering at you from a distance –   Hoping that you would notice me,   And strike your flawless smile my way.       I remember those afternoons,   Searching for you in a crowd –   Of people making their way,    Through the busy hallways.      I remember those afternoons,   Holding back the thoughts of regret –   The thoughts knocking upon my heart,   Because I did not tell you the truth.      I remember,   Thinking that love always fails –   But I innocently looked over the truth,   Because love never fails in the end.      I remember those evenings,   Looking upon my bedroom ceiling –   Wishing that I was in your thoughts,   And you would stay in my mind forever.      I remember those evenings,   Counting down the seconds –   Until midnight struck,   And then the seconds to dawn.      I remember those evenings,   Crying myself to sleep –   And finding myself in horrible dreams,   Of perpetual misery and loneliness.      I remember,   Thinking that love always fails –   But I innocently looked over the truth,   Because love never fails in the end.         Thanks for the comments! <3

20090131160139AASCe4j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	At what age can you start to 'spoil' your baby?	I know that babies can't be spoiled because you are giving them what they need when they cry, but I was curious as to when babies can tell "cause and effect"?  My daughter just turned 4 months and she seems to cry all the time when I'm not holding her... is it because she knows if she cries when I put her down that I'll pick her up or simply because she wants to be held?  It makes it difficult to clean. ha
20090131162734AAzeLbH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Baby's stuff dillema?	Here is the deal    we had a baby few month ago and of course we had a baby shower and register for that. One couple from our church who was invited to a baby shower aks if we would like to get some items (which were on registry like bottle sterilizer, wipes warmer and diaper gynnie) from their baby since they don't need it anymore and that way we could save some money. We agreed, but I ask them what is going to happen if they will have another baby? They smiled and said that the are not planning to have another baby, but in that case we can always return those items. Now they are having a baby in 3 month and while we have no problem to return sterilizer and wipes warmer - we still in need for diaper gynie. They are not that rich, so I think they expect us to return that and I agree with that, but here is the question. Do we have to return an old diaper gynie and buy a new one for us or do we have to buy a new one for them and use an old one ourself?

What do you guys think? could it be a boy because they're generally easier to make out on an ultrasound ?

The only thing I can think of is to offer breast more often during the day and hope that the coming night she will not wake as often.

Did you assist your baby with night-weaning, or did you let them do it on their own?       I am seriously becoming sleep deprived and increasingly irritated. She is sleep deprived as well.... she maybe gets about 8 hours a night (recommended is around 10-12) and maybe 2 hours of nap time during the day. She should technically be getting 14-16 hours of sleep in a 24hr period. Her biological clock is out of whack anyway :(      I'm also trying to follow some of the suggestions in the No-Cry Sleep Solution, great ideas btw, but I'm not really here to force her to sleep.

20090131182336AA1DfL3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	If you were me, which guy would you choose?	Imagine you're a 17 year old senior in highschool. Your boyfriend is 19 and a freshmen in college. You've been together for 2 years and are in love. But lately things have been different. And you're not sure if you want to be with him. You call one night at 3 in the morning when you can't sleep, and a girl answers his phone, laughing. You ask him about her the next day, and he says he's "tutoring" her. Just two weeks before, he broke up with you, but sent you a long email explaining why he's stupid and all the amazing things about you. But you're pretty sure he's cheating.    The other guy is your age, and you dated him during your 8th grade and freshmen year. He was physically abusive, and that's why you broke up. But now he's changed. He's really sweet, and cares about you more than your 19 year old boyfriend does. There's a lot of chemistry between you two. And he even started seeing a therapist so he could have a chance with you. He's only dangerous when he doesn't take his meds.    Who do you choose? And don't say neither.

This afternoon I had some really really bad cramping and started bleeding bright red blood (filled a pad in a 1/2 hour) and went straight to the hospital. They did an ultrasound right away and to my surprise, the baby was perfectly fine, I couldn't believe after all that bleeding that it could be ok. They diagnosed me with a subchorionic hemorrhage, put me on bedrest, gave me a shot of progesterone and said to see my doctor in three days. They said this is a threatened miscarriage. I'm almost 10 weeks.    Have you ever experienced this? Know anyone that has? What was your outcome?

Me and my boyfriend are disagreeing over this and I need your opinion.      Here goes:      He says that he was premature when born. His mother says he was a month early and was a premature baby. BUT, he was 8lbs when born! I just think it's funny that he labels himself as premature when technically 8lbs is more than a full formed baby. He did have some issues at birth which was related to the embilacal chord (sp?), also had some stuff in his lungs which caused minor breathing problems.. but would you consider this "premature"?       I was under the impression that premature was the runt of the litter. The small, not quite fully formed offspring. Thoughts?!?!

20090131164452AAogcJw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What is your opinion about punishing other peoples children?	I have a son and when he misbehaves I send him to his room or take privileges away. When My stepson misbehaves I will sometimes punish him the same way but not as much because I don't know if I have the right. Then if I do, when he goes to his moms he tells her I punished him and it causes problems with my husband and her because she feels like I shouldn't be punishing him. But when I don't I feel like my son will feel like I like my stepson better if I don't punish them the same way. Also my husband is at work most of the day and my stepson is with me a lot so I can't leave it up to him to do the punishing. He also overlooks some of the things I would not when the kids are being disrespectful. What do I do? What is the right way to handle this?

20090131175406AA94RiO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Still confused, please help!!!!!!?	I had what I thought was a period about 14 days ago. But it was not normal I usually start out light and then become heavy with in a day and have a heavy flow for about two days then it tapers off a total of about 5-6 days. This time it was just brown /pink/ rust coolor and not even heavy enough to show anything on a liner. Then after 7 days I thought it had stopped but I have been have brown spotting for the last 7 days espically after exercising. So in all I have been spotting for 14 days. I also have been having terrible headaches which I have most of the time anyway. I also have aching in my lower back and lower abdomen. At times certains things make me nausous and I begin to gag along with having a blood/metallic taste in my mouth. Plus my breast ache on and off. I know these are all symptoms but I tested after spotting for 6 days and it was negative. I guess I just don't want to test again and be disappointed. Any ideas why spotting for 14 days? Also my husband and I have been ttc for 8 months now. Thanks in advance.

But in her crib she wakes up often, and for long periods of time. I've considered using some kind of mps/cd player in her room to play very low soft music, and we've also tried a number of things inclusing orajel (she's teething), motrin some nights when its bad, and different sleeping positions. Her dad often rocks her to sleep, but this seems to be less of an issue now, because she will go to sleep alone in the living room.      She sleeps fine anywhere but her crib. Any tips?

20090131170619AAlg92y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	REPOST - CIO/sleep training question?	I'm asking again because I'd like a few more answers! :)      I KNOW this is a hot topic but I'd like opinions on what ppl think I should do. I have 10month old twins whom I have to put to bed every night on my own. My husband I own a restaurant, and he's at work till midnight or so every night. Up until not too long ago, holding each of them for just under 10 min or so was enough to get them to sleep. I have a routine which soothes them, I look for sleepy cues & don't put them to bed too early or late. Well, it takes upwards of 1 hour to put one to sleep these days. By the time I'm done, the other baby is so overtired, she doesn't know HOW to go to bed no matter what I try. Needless to say, if you accumulate this last week, they have now missed HOURS of sleep and are not themselves. I hate to let them CIO but I don't know what else to do? Sleep is so important...

Since i found out i was pregnant my mother and aunts have been buying my son clothes as i was putting them away today i realized its more than enough for his first year. Well i'm having a baby shower thrown for me and i have recently been checking my registry and not a lot of people have gotten stuff from it,Although there are more then a 20 people attending. The problem i run into with this is that i am worried that the guest are going to buy him clothes and not the things that i actually need from my registry. Should i mention something to some of my friends or should i just keep quite? Don't get me wrong i will appreciate anything i get but I'm worried that i wont get what i actually need.

20090131175607AA2hNrF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 9.5 month old does not want to be spoon-fed anymore, yet cannot feed himself that well with a spoon. WWYD?	It has been going on for a couple of months now. I'm running out of ideas in terms of finger foods. I spoon feed him every now and then when I get lucky. He just wants to take the spoon out of my hand and do it himself. I give him the spoon to do so, yet he cannot master self spoon-feeding yet and the spoon ends up on the floor. He is in the process of getting his first tooth, too, so I think I am limited as to which types of finger/hard foods I can give him. I want to give him beef that has been in the blender and spoon feed it to him, but --unsucessful. How do you feed your little one roast beef (slow cooker style, stew) if you cannot blend it and if he does not have all of his teeth? Meat has iron. I know rice cereal has iron too, but the spoon feeding thing is a problem. Thanks!

My baby is 9.5 months old and is in the process of getting his first tooth as we speak. Since he won't let me spoon-feed him anymore and he cannot spoon feed himself (we've tried), can you help me list some foods for babies with no teeth, 1 tooth, or 2 teeth? Do you think it is safe to give him cooked diced sweet potato/carrots? Or do you think (since he has no teeth) that diced needs to be slightly mashed? Or, do you think diced is okay and he will end up using his gums to mash the food?   Thanks!

She was perfectly fine all day yesterday, but when i put her down to bed she woke up around 1am whining and wimpering....then she just threw up. She threw up maybe 5 times total from 1am to 9am.  She refuses to eat, she is taking tiny sips of pedilyte and some fruit juices that i try to offer her. She kept asking for milk and i finally gave it to her around 2pm (i only gave her 3 oz) twice and suprisingly she kept it down. She also has no fever and she hasn't really thrown up since 9am.

I find myself calling her every hour or so to check where she is.  Is this normal?       I want her safe, but I want her to have some freedom.

My child is 25 months old and as of this past Monday, she's spanking her baby dolls while they stand in the corner. I haven't spanked her and I asked, "who spanks?" She told me "Boria", which is what she calls her teacher. I have a lawyer, I filed with Dept of Human Services, the Police as well as the abuse hotline. I have a Thursday session with the Children's Advocacy Center. My child has a large vocabulary and can frame anywhere from three to ten word sentences. I don't know what this session entails. Do I get to be in the room with her while they are interviewing her? Is there a one way mirror that I sit behind? Has anyone had a child this young that made for a credible witness? In any case, the record of what she did has been documented; she can't be protected anymore.

20090131165939AAUeK0V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Daughter afraid of boys?	I have a 17-year old daughter who is currently a senior in high school.  All her life, she has never had a boyfriend or even a friend that is a boy.  This specifically is not why I am writing, because she is free to be friends with whom she wants.  However, she has confided in me that she is afraid of men and boys and has been her whole life.  I am not sure if it is getting worse as she gets older or is just manifesting itself in different ways.  I was never like this so I am not sure what would be considered 'normal' feelings for her to have.  I have talked to a few close friends about this and they say that I should look into her past to see if anyone could have hurt her in any way.  I can think of nothing, except for things that I don't think would still have much of an effect on her now, although maybe you think different (if so, please tell me).  What I am thinking of happened during preschool.  There was a group of boys that used to chase her and scare her all the time at recess.  She was very afraid and for this reason she spent time hiding from boys and staying physically very close to her female friends.  When she got older she always feared them.  Although she is a shy person, it isn't a fear of rejection.  She is afraid that they will do something to her to harm her.  She can't even watch the news because of all the rapes and things of that nature.      I just don't know what to do or how to make it better.  I would just like to find out what happened to make her this way and how to help her get past her fears.  I appreciate any input you can provide.

20090131175045AADSL3S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do you get kicked out?	My best friend and I want to get kicked out of our parents' houses. Please don't ask why, just trust that we have our valid reasons.      My question to all of you is, how would the pair of us get kicked out?      We didn't want to do anything bad, but we have past the point of stipulations and are quite desperate at the moment. Neither of us like our home lives and we don't want to be there.      No worries, we're bound to get kicked out anyway, but we want to go out OUR way. You see, I come from a strict Christian background and her parents are over the top, old-fashioned Catholics; she is an atheist and I'm a bisexual--lesbian, I think but one miracle at a time.      We don't want to be kicked out for being ourselves; that's stupid and completely unfair. You could say we are being rather pompus, wanting to choose how we get kicked out. But how would you feel if you got kicked out for doing nothing but being you?      We have almost everything planned: a place to stay, money, jobs, ect. But we need a way to get out. Our careers (that we pretty much already have 'in the bag' ) don't consist of an education-- though we're getting ours any way (see: we're not stupid)-- and do imply free will to move a lot. To bigger and better cities. We don't have that at our parents' houses.      I could give you our back stories about how we never fit in there, but that isn't the point.      The point is: HOW THE HELL CAN WE GET KICKED OUT OF THE HOUSE?      We would appreciate responses that are legal (for us and out parents; we don't hate them, but mainly only legal for us) and plausible.       Thank you, answer please.      xo   eggyourmomscar

20090131202352AA7Wyju	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	10 points...best answer.... I need advice...preferably from girls.?	I lost all my friends last year to video games(story not relevant) and im not really focused on meeting new friends, but I would rather start looking for girls, because I am 15 and have never had a girlfriend... I know its pathetic, there are 3 girls I know i could easily get with, but I don like any of them in that way... I am terrible at talking to girls because I usually come off as immature, unless there the ones to start the conversation with me. I guess I don't know how to start off the conversation, I am honestly not ugly, I have heard a couple girls say I was hot before when they thought I wasn't listening. What is a way I could get them to start talking to me first? or How could I start a conversation. Some of the things I like to do are Cook, Long board and write raps based on things that happen in my life. I am 15 years old and a sophomore in high school.
20090131204703AADAcY0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can i test in the morning?	i know i asked this question last night, i just want to get as many opinions as i can.  my period ended on Jan 5.  I am pretty sure I ovulated between the 19 and 21.  the last few days (almost a week) I have been exhausted!  My breasts are also tender, and according to my husband I am extremely moody (lol).  I have also had quite a bit of cramping, but no spotting.  The tricky think is that I have very irregular periods.  my last period lasted 30 days (if that is any help)      Thanks for taking the time to answer!

20090131201632AAP30x6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is Having Your Dad "Sharpen his Knife at You" a Normal Rite of Passage?	When I was young, a friend once asked me, "why do dads all sharpen their knives at you when they tell you about the birds and the bees?"    I answered that I didn't know they ALL did.  He assured me that all the boys in his class, both at his current school and his previous ones all said that their dads did that; all except Harry, who said his dad whittled instead.    (He confided that Harry was weird and always said something different from the other boys, and had suddenly disappeared from his family over winter vacation. We later learned that Harry had gone to live with "his" grandma when "he" got "his" period, and a year later, Harriet came back instead.)    However, my friend reported that all the boys said that they didn't hear much their dads said, because they were too worried about what dad was going to do with the knife, when he got done explaining all this stiff... er, stuff. (Pardon the Freudian slip.)    I didn't need to ask my friend if his dad did that, because that man was a compulsive knife sharpener; in less than two years, he ground away two thirds of the blade of his new Buck Knife.  He'd sharpened his knife at me, while he was grilling me about my intentions toward his daughter.    However, my dad did that too, when we were discussing the facts of life, and my older brother sharpened his knife at a young friend of the family while grilling him about his intentions toward my niece.    This young family friend also reported not hearing much of what was said, because he was too worried about what my brother was going to do with the knife.  I must admit that similar thoughts crossed my mind while being grilled about a man's daughter.    Is this really as common a practice as it seems?  How much male ignorance about sexual matters should be blamed upon it?

20090131201802AA9W1SN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is This Good? 16 year old girl!?	His soft lips, his hair, the warmth from his skin, it all felt good to be by him again. When we were done kissing I saw the guy that I used to like, walking up to us with a sad look. “How could you do this to me?” He asked me. “How could I do what to you?” I asked, because I didn’t know what he was talking about. “Nicky, I liked you, I’ve liked you since the first day I saw you!” David said, almost yelling. “Bryan’s been my boyfriend, and I don’t even really know you.” I finally said, looking at Bryan. All he did was trying to figure what was going on. “Hey, how about we go somewhere else, Nicky?” Bryan asked me, I guess so we could get away from David. “Why so you can go kissing on her more?” David asked like he knew everything about me. “You don’t know one thing about her besides her name, so just give her a break, and let us be together.” Bryan said, defending me and him. From that point on, I actually realized that Bryan is going to stick with me for the rest of my life, because we are perfect.      Nicky is 16(pregnant), Bryan is 18(Nicky's boyfriend), David is 17(guy at Nicky's mom's work)      This is just a paragraph in my book, but I want to know if it's good.
20090226085511AAUvR7p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Please help, my four year old son is sick with diarrhea?	He just turned four last week, and has always had trouble with potty training (peeing, not pooping).    Now he is pretty sick and is feeling rotten. He's asleep most of the time and when he wakes up he's just like a little baby, not being able to do anything for himself.       The first bout of diarrhea he tried to run to the potty and didn't make it. With the second he just dirtied the sheets.       Should I put him in diapers? It feels like I'm going backwards with potty training as I have been really trying hard to help him perfect his potty training lately, but it's just really disgusting and he can't make it to the potty quick enough.
20090226085450AA3EgsY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why is my boyfriend mad at me?	I'm sixteen.   My boyfriend of five months seems to be in a mood with me.   Tonight there is a gathering at a youth club near my house. There will be music and no drinking or anything. None of my friends are going, because they have homework etc to do, so if i went i'd just be with my boyfriend. All his friends are going though.   So i said i won't go, because i don't want to just cling to him all night and ruin his night. I figured he'll have fun spending a night with his mates, as i'm often around instead or with them.   Now he's being off with me on IM, like giving blunt answers. And when i texted him before, he didn't put many kisses on like he always does. He's being really off with me.   Any ideas why?

20090226090431AApZGv5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Could he be teething? And should I worry about the decreased feeding?	Hi, My son is 11 weeks old and is constantly shoving his fists in his mouth, dribbling and generally being grumpy. For the past two days he has only been taking 3oz at each feed before he starts screaming and pushes the bottle out with his tongue (he usually has nearer 7oz). He usually wakes at about 4am for a feed but has been waking at 5.30am crying and then not wanting to be fed, he just seems to want to be cuddled. He has also had diarrhoea for the past two days. Could this be teething or should I get him to the docs? Ive tried putting dentinox teething gel on but that doesn't seem to help. Also, should I worry about the fact hes only having half of what he usually eats? He's still peeing lots!

20090226090210AAaFf83	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	6 month old not napping well at daycare?	My daughter is 6 months old and just moved up a room in daycare.  She is now with the 6-12 month children (although once they start walking, the kids move up again).  This is her third week in the room and she is still not napping well.  At home, she usually takes a nap between 9-10am for 1.5-2 hours, then maybe another short nap around 12-2, and sometimes a little 30 minute nap around 4.  She usually goes to bed on the weekends around 7 and we start the work week with the same bed time.  What happens is that on Monday she'll take a good morning nap at daycare, but may not take any other naps (but sometimes will take one).  So, that night, she's tired and wants to go to bed earlier (around 6:30).  The next day she'll take a short nap in the morning and perhaps a 30 minute afternoon nap and again want to go to bed early.  By Friday, she's doing good to have any nap at all and sleeping on the way home.  I've told the daycare when her normal naps are, but when she's there it is too noisy and new for her to sleep well.  They don't have a separate area for naps.  It's all one big room.  I don't know what to do!  Do you think she could still adjust to the new surroundings?  Anything else I should try?  She slept fine eventually in the old room and the set up was the same.

20090131204627AAh4XkS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My best friend betrayed me?	I had this girl as a best friend for 3 years since the Summer of 2005, I was 21 at that time and she was 19. We always kept close contact with eachother and see eachother every once in a while. Yesterday, she IM'd me. Here's the conversation...      Her: Hello there, little miss perfect.   Me: Hey, what do you want?   Her: Nothing, you're just a stupid little b*tch who thinks that she gets everything she wants, just because she has money and lives in a tall apartment building. But you won't think that anymore, once I come and beat your @ss, and tell your deepest darkest secret unless you do what I ask you to do. But don't worry, I will make your life a living hell. You're such a stupid little brat that thinks she can get whatever she wants. Well, I'm gonna make sure at least one half of your life is hellish.   Me: Why would you do this to me? I thought we were friends?   Her: You would think that. But when I met some of the girls at my job that they were better than you, they told me how better off I would be just making fun of you.   Me: Fine, what do you want me to do?   Her: Oh, you’ll see. Don’t worry little girl. I’ll make sure you get what you deserve. I'll see you tommorrow after work.      She then signed off, and I cried my eyes out for the rest of the day, I also forgot to mention that she works on weekends too. So today, I was outside just having a walk because I was depressed about the day before, and all of a sudden, my ex best friend came by with a couple of her new "best friends" and grabbed me by the jacket and shoved me to the wall. She started cursing me out along with her other friends, and she said that in order for her to not tell my secret, I have to eat snow filled with piss. At first I refused, but then she punched me in the face and told me to eat it or else I'm gonna get more beatings, and that my secret will be revealed. So I had no choice but to eat the dirty snow and I tried not to throw up, my Ex-BFF said that if I throw up, it's not gonna count as me eating it and I'll have to eat a handful or else the secret is revealed. So I ate it, and I felt sick to my stomach, and she just punched me in the stomach and told me that she'll be back looking out for me tommorrow, but she's gonna go to my apartment to get me and then will look for more "interesting" stuff for me to do in order to keep the secret. I can't do this anymore. I hate my life. I think I either wanna kill myself or move to another state without her knowing, so that I wouldn't have to deal with this anymore. What can I do? I'm crying my eyes out right now, no matter what, now I have to deal with her everyday, because she'll be coming to my apartment everyday for me to do gross stuff in order for her to keep my secret, HELP ME!!!! I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE!!!! ='(.

My son recently had his 9 month well visit, and his doctor was not happy with his weight gain (or lack there of) We had this same problem with our middle child only it ocurred at 6 months.

20090131193438AAb5nGs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	The Question -- How much does adoption cost?	Ok I asked the question the other day and the responses were a little weird.      Many of you say it's all about me, or            as a user (tish_part deux) said "and people wonder why some of us have critical beliefs about adoption practices.."         Sounds a little weird to me, I love children and want to take a child in from my heart. Love them, care for them, give them the life with a family they aren't having right now. Why is that a practice?      Just because she doesn't have the time or need to adopt doesn't make us all like that, some of us actual want to make a difference in a childs life.      What is wrong is that question? Seriously are that many people air headed to be just rude? Because I believe that this subject "adoption" is where many of us have questions, I'm sure many here have adopted their childrens and they know the answr to my question.         I will admit, I know nothing about it! This is something we've been talking about but I've always known that I wanted to do. Why is that wrong?      I think it's heartless and rude that people have such a big deal with questions about adoption.         Also to those who are all dramatic about WHY ADOPT JUST FOSTER!...yes Fostering a child is something we want to do to, but is my question how much does it cost to adopt a child, rule the fostering part out? I dont think so, so why judge so quickly user Mom to Foster Children.         Anyways just wanted to let that out! God bless and I hope everybody who opens their heart to Adoption and Fostering treats the child the way they deserve to be treated. If you don't want a child to love them and care for them then don't bother.

20090226091013AA8VG9r	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My babygirls here, but in the NICU..?	So Friday afternoon I started having really bad contractions around 4pm which I didnt actually know thats what it was so I didnt worry about it. Around 8pm I decided I better head on i n to L&D because the pains were literally doubling me over! (I was already dialated to 3) My OB tried and tried to stop my contractions but NOTHING worked.      That Saturday afternoon Michael & My mother talked and decided that if they wouldnt stop the contractions & I was going to go ahead and have her that my OB needed to have me transfered to my specialist beinging if I didnt go they would life flight the baby and we would be seperated and the fiance didnt want that at all. When I left the hospital I was 4cm's dialated and by time the ambulance got me to the specialist I was 9. They kept me knocked out in the ambulance on morphine because I was trying to push! I got my epidural being I literally couldnt handle the pain and it was 15minutes I was dialated to 10.      Jewellyssa Faith Jackson was born 2-22-09 at 12:59am. She weighted 3lb and 14oz and was 17inches long. They have her in the NICU but shes not been on any oxygen or anything. They have a feeding tube there using every other feeding being she doesnt want to take every bottle right yet. They say once she takes all of here bottles and hits 4lb's she will be good to come home. I just thought Id give everyone on here an update on my little babygirl and let you guys know my little 34 weeker is doing EXCELLENT. So to make this a question, when did you have you little one and have far along were you?
20090226091159AAAvklC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	When I delivered my baby?	The doctor had me stop pushing because the cord was wrapped around his neck. She just said to stop and instructed the resident who was delivering to unwrap it. She didn't act like it was a big deal at all, but she is an incredibly calm doctor. I was just wondering.....was he in danger? (Obviously not at that point when they just unwrapped it, I mean during the labor) The nurses were watching his heartbeat pretty closely and I heard them say once something like "It's low....but I'm okay with it. We'll watch it" Anyway, am I lucky that everything turned out ok? Or is that a common thing? Did that happen with your baby?
