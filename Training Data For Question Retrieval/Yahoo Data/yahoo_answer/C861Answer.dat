DunU13FNaa	Hello Canada,  I know heating a large home in a cold climate is a challenge.  I am in the same situation.    The first thing you want to do is forget the idea of finishing off part of your upstairs to possibly rent it.  You're just making things even more complicated. If you truly have no money, and you can't borrow it from a family member, then why are you even contemplating incurring more expenses?    First things first...  try to get your house heated without loosing all your heat to the outdoors.          What you want to do is check all places where heat could be escaping from your house. Check all windows and doors, add some weatherstripping if you need to. Use curtains at night over the windows to keep some heat in. Make sure you have caulked gaps on the outside around any openings . Check around your plumbing, see if there are any big air leaks where pipes come in, use an expanding foam in a can to seal up.    Go insulate your attic space.  Its the cheap fix, its easy, and  you don't need alot of skill to do it.   Having an un-insulated attic/ceiling space is like leaving the windows open and the heat turned on.    I know insulating is not very fun, but it has to be done.  I did mine, and now my heat stays downstairs alot longer than before. Good luck to you.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	no money and no equity - forget it - not going to happen|`|JZG7vpUlaa	Why don't you just insulate?  You can get a tax rebate and in Ontario there are additional rebates possible.  You might be able to get a loan for this.

1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Because WYSIWYG tools give the impression that web design is easy.  Web pages like facebook and myspace give people the impression that this stuff is easy.    I understand where you're coming from, and web design is easy... until something goes wrong, or until the scope is expanded to include dynamic content, databases, server side code, support for multiple browsers, etc...|`|11efecc459a72f4bd8c4b6682ab7bae4aa	Yeah actually its not that easy, but may be they think its easy because there are many html editors like dreamweaver and front page and also many small graphics and animation tools. but its not enough. they dont know anything about web designing in actual.Also they dont seem to be knowing any languages they will have to learn to be a web developer.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	basic web page design IS easy. If ll they want to do is HTML, you can pretty much teach yourself that. I did 10 yrs ago, and I'm not a trained programmer by any means. I'm an accountant.
AA11173563	they are waiting on their bail out lol|`|HEzWkWS7aa	No that is awful. I did get pushed back form Feb 3 to Feb 10 but now it says my funds will be deposited tomorrow, they adjusted my refund because of a glitches in Turbotaxes system when asking about the recovery rebate question. I would call the IRS directly and talk to someone as to why your refund is being held up. I heard it you did a pay stub return it might be held up until 2/24. I do not know if that is true though.  Good Luck. I will pray you will get it faster:)|`|p8GxCbolaa	Yeah, unfortunatly that is not a good sign...next Thur morning look to see if it says "your refund is scheduled to be direct deposited on February 13, 2009.  You'll get that message first!  Sorry..the IRS is very slow and eratic this year.  I'll say a prayer for you to get it soooner.|`|3pxDUEtMaa	It may be due to errors on your tax return, mine was pushed from 1/30 to 2/3, to 2/10; then when I checked WMR this morning, it said my return had mistakes that were manually corrected on the Recovery Rebate Credit, and my new refund amount was actually $300 more than expected. You may be experiencing the same issues; hang in there you may receive more $$$ than you think.|`|PRNu0V7eaa	Well you will have it by 2/13, next friday. Thats better than 2/24.  Also there is a system malfunction with the WMR.
0u6qy9Uuaa	it will take quite a while to go from 533 to anything respectable - a year or two maybe|`|a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	Things just aren't what they used to be.  It's not going to be easy to get credit anymore.  Anything within your power to not let anything else be derogatory and put in the time.  It's all you can do.|`|eO4y3m1maa	It's going to take a few years....depending how badly deliquent you were but if you owed a cell phone 1k...im guessing you were pretty behind.    It will say on your credit it was paid in full, but it will still say it was deliquent at the time of payment....u can be late to pay whatever but once u hit 30 days its on your credit report for a good 7 years.      Just keep paying what you do have on time...and it will slowly go up.    When you have credit cards it doesnt matter how much you owe them..long as you pay the minimum monthly balance.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Unless you negotiated "pay for delete" agreements, those paid accounts will remain on your credit history.  To improve your credit, you need to demonstrate "good behavior" with new (current) accounts.|`|pNy8lakjaa	It doesn't come off in 90 days, it comes off in 7 years. Unless you asked for a delete when you were discussing with your creditors, it will stay there for awhile making it hard to rent an apartment, buy a house, even get a good job! Credit cards are the sticking point, since you closed your accounts, that made your score drop super fast, since your available credit is nil now, and that is what people want to know is how well you handle the credit that is available to you.|`|AA11173563	90 -180 days as long as they report 0 balance or paid charge off

It matters when the coverage starts and not when you open the account.  So, if you started the qualified policy in January but don't get around to opening the account until February you could reimuburse yourself.  But, not on past bills at all.

That's the whole point, to help you save for retirement free of taxation.|`|AA11173563	no you will pay the penalty and taxes as income so the whole deal is close to 50%|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	hey mj -     just because they WITHHELD $2000 form your $10,000 withdrawal doesn't mean you might not owe more tax - you have to add that $10,000 to your other income for the year and if that pushes you into the say, 25% tax bracket, you might owe up to another $500 in tax|`|UDxL7lPqaa	No, unless it is a Roth 401(k).|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	No, and if you withdraw this money before your 59 1/2 you pay an additional 10% penalty.|`|FB5IjcHeaa	Doctor Deth could also be wrong. You might actually get a refund if it throws you into a tax bracket that shows you paid to much taxes. This happened to me and I got 3,000 dollars back in my federal tax refund.|`|fRkX3Gfdaa	Yes, but you have to roll ALL of it into an IRA or equivalent.|`|3ubzZjWYaa	Un-reimbursed medical expenses for you, your spouse, or dependents.   Purchase of an employee's principal residence.   Payment of college tuition and related educational costs such as room and board for the next 12 months for you, your spouse, dependents, or children who are no longer dependents.   Payments necessary to prevent eviction of you from your home, or foreclosure on the mortgage of your principal residence.   For funeral expenses and repair of a primary residence.     You become totally disabled.   You are in debt for medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income.   You are required by court order to give the money to your divorced spouse, a child, or a dependent.   You are separated from service (through permanent layoff, termination, quitting or taking early retirement) in the year you turn 55, or later.   You are separated from service and you have set up a payment schedule to withdraw money in substantially equal amounts over the course of your life expectancy. (Once you begin taking this kind of distribution you are required to continue for five years or until you reach age 59 1/2, whichever is longer.)|`|6vZKp5XCaa	No. If you are at least 59.5 you can withdraw it without a penalty but you will pay taxes on the money. I took 10,000 dollars out of mine and they held 2,000 for taxes. That is 20% but I was not penalized for early withdrawal because I met the age requirement. Do what you must. It is nice if you do not have to touch the money until you retire but if you have an unforeseen problem it is nice it is there. Besides you may die before you retire too. Hopefully not.
E7IPy6cDaa	i got a W-2 for $50... i dont see why you woldnt have to pay taxes on $600.  you have to report ALL income.  you have to report interest on bank accounts even if it is $1.  so yes... you have to report it.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	You must report ALL income from ALL sources if your total income exceeds the filing requirement amount.  You are required to keep accurate business records and use those to prepare your tax return.  Use any 1099s to verify the accuracy of your records and theirs NOT as the sole source document of your revenues!    Don't assume that a 1099 wasn't filed!  I cut 1099s for any amount of $1 or more.  If it was lost in the mail or returned for a bad address, the IRS probably knows about it.|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	If it is $400 or more you must file the tax return. You must report the income even if you do not get 1099-misc.    You are self employed or independent contractor. You must file your tax return if your self employed income is $400 or more. You will report your income and expenses on schedule C or C-EZ (Form 1040). This income is subject to SE tax at 15.3%. Read: http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/04/tax-...|`|Vl4ZLrf5aa	Yes, you have to claim all income.  Nope, if you don't receive an 1099, it means they didn't report it to the IRS.|`|mmAjpMX1aa	The tax laws say you have to report all income you receive from any source, even if you don't get paperwork showing you received it (Tips earned from waiting tables are a prime example).  So if you found $100 just lying on the sidewalk, you actually are legally required to count it as additional income and report it on your tax return.    However, if you don't report it, there likely won't be a problem, because unless someone tips off the IRS, there's no way they would know you had that money.|`|LCqiO7O3aa	Just because you haven't received a 1099 doesn't mean they didn't send one, Have you moved? Or maybe they are late sending them out.  They didn't have to be postmarked until monday feb 2nd this year.  However, what I have read says that any self employed net earnings  over $400 should be reported.|`|KYphLHNNaa	Nope.
eO4y3m1maa	No, but that is more of criminal act. I dont see why it would be on your credit report?|`|a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	No.|`|blC1U6LFaa	No.  A buddy of mine was in a similar situation a few years ago.  He's fine.|`|pNy8lakjaa	It probably won't show up on your credit report, but it will be reported to Chexsystems, they deal with check fraud, and make it difficult to open a new account at a different bank.
9d1117d6d6807deaf354236fab0b8dd9aa	Label all the boxes so you know where everything is so you will be able to put your stuff in the room that it belongs in.  I've moved a lot as a kid... and that helped a lot when it was time to take it all out of the boxes.  Whatever is fragile label box as "fragile" and put those things away first at your new apt.      1st do your bedroom...(trust me) you will be really tired and will want somewhere to rest and sleep at night.  2nd- bathroom stuff  3rd- kitchen stuff  4th- living room    Always leave enough space to be able to move around and take stuff out of the boxes.  Also make sure you put the furniture where you are going to leave it.  That way you have plenty of room to organize everything.|`|AA11173563	who cares? it doesn't matter. He can do one room then you will only come behind him and do it your way any how.|`|pNy8lakjaa	Being a skilled mover..     Always move stuff that you will not need frequently first. For example, stuff you have in storage and rarely pull out. Its quicker to just shove that stuff into your new storage areas, to make room for the big stuff.    Then your furnature, since you  will need the room to figure out where everything will go..     The last things you should move, clothes, tolitries (shampoo, toothbrush.. ect.) food from your fridge, everything else.. ect.     When unpacking its always best to make sure you unpack you kitchen stuff and bathroom stuff first so you can eat and shower without any major problems! Also keep tabs on your bedding so you can make your bed quickly if you both get tired from all this moving!
4ZNl4V3Oaa	If the amount of interest is less than $10 they are not required to send a 1099-INT.  The mailing deadline this year was Monday -- just 3 days ago -- so it may still be in transit if it was sent out Monday.    You don't need a 1099-INT in hand to file; you just need to know the amount.  Your Dec statement should have the total interest paid in 2008 listed on it.  You can use that to prepare your return.  If you have on-line access to your account you should be able to access the information that way as well.  Lastly you can always call them and ask.|`|VPycXVIlaa	I haven't gotten mine yet either.

If you did this then it will go to that bank then to yours so it might not show up until Monday, but it is on its way  hooray for you and yours:)

They're only suppose state your dates of employment. If it were the case that past jobs air out dirty laundries, then you, multiplied by millions of other people will never, ever, ever work a job ever again....and you know that's not the case for you, and neither has it been the case for the employers hiring/firing you (I'm sure some of them haven't been saints at their last employer either, and they get jobs!......you get what I'm saying?). Just make sure - and it is very important - that you find someone in charge who will give you a good reference. More than likely, the next job who makes the phone call will take your old boss's word for it about your strongest qualities. You'll be alright.|`|7QPv7ta7aa	A former employer can say anything, as long as it's true.  There is no law limiting the reference to confirming employment dates.

They will assume you were laid off    They wont say what you were fired for, because they would potentially open themselves up for a lawsuit     why were you fired?  thats nothing. did they tell you thats why you were being fired? probably not.

There is no law that says otherwise|`|AHCelSY1aa	Under California law the employer can disclose this information to a future employer without any legal repercussions since it is a truthful statement.  You would only have legal recourse if they said an untruth regarding your employment.   Also be advised there are no laws in any state that prevents an employer from giving a negative reference as long as it is not done maliciously with willful intent to hurt the person seeking employment.|`|ry4DKt0Qaa	They will say the dates you worked there.  They can also say if you quit or were fired and if they have proof of you steaing, breaking company policy, etc they can also say that.|`|iIJm5JToaa	They can only confirm dates and if they would hire you back.  But that's "technically" which is  a broad term.  I know when I've done reference checks, theres a multitude of ways to convey how you REALLY feel about the person.    Now if you work for a big corporation, where an HR department does the employement verifications for your new employer, no biggie.  But if the new company will be talking to your direct supervisor, or someone that saw you day to day, you may have a problem.  Just the tone of their voice when they answer the question can tell a new employer a lot.  For example: "I'd hire her again in a heartbeat" in an upbeat voice tells me you were a good employee  whereas "No, I wouldn't rehire" in an angry voice also speaks volumes about you.    But if you think your going to get canned, ask for a reference WHILE they're canning you.  It's not like a new employer will ever tell you "oh no, so and so at your old company told me that you were a terrible employee".  They just won't hire you.  You'd be suprised at what goes on in those phone calls.    But, hiring and firing is a part of business.  Personally, I don't give horrible references, I hope the people that I fired find a good job so I try to help out.  I just don't want them working for me again.    And on another note, usually an HR manager or supervisor will try to keep it short with a new employer.  Depending on what your getting fired for, you may not have anything to worry about.  Maybe it just isn't a good fit for you, which is not bad.  Now if it was for theft, or something along those lines, you may have a problem.|`|oSBl3xeeaa	Don't fear.  Employers are only suppose to give dates of employment.  When they tread into the reasons why they are no longer employed, they tread into legalities and you can definitely sue.  Always follow up with the interviewer you are seeking employment with and if there are any descrepancies, you have a right to know what they previous employer informed the potential employer.

0JoWTQWoaa	You will have to pay taxes on the amount.  Cancelled debt is considered taxable income to the debtor.    It all depends on your other income and what tax bracket you are in. I can not tell you an exact amount or even an estimated amount.    No, you will not pay the entire amount.  The tax will be a percentage of the $1,300.  If you are in the lowest tax bracket (10%) the tax could be $130. The tax brackets go up depending on your other income. Just go to an online tax preparation site (my suggestion is taxact.com, I have used it for years) and put in your tax information to complete your tax return. It is free.  This will give you an exact answer to your question.|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	Generally, if a debt you owe is canceled or forgiven, other than as a gift or bequest, you must include the canceled amount in your income.

Read about debt cancellation, http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/08/us-i...|`|E7IPy6cDaa	mary anne is right.  you have to pay taxes and report it as income.     you think you are getting a break, but then mr tax man steps in for his cut...|`|AA11132354	YEP.  This is income to you, and must be reported.  How much tax depends on your other income, not just its amount.    Think about it, you had credit card, bought stuff, got benefit of stuff, promised to repay, reneged on your promises and legal obligations, credit card company tried to collect and couldn't, wrote it off.  You got $1300 you didn't repay, so it is income to you.|`|HEzWkWS7aa	you must report it as income on your tax return. Unless you were insolvent and your total amount of debts from all sources exceed your assets. if you went through debt settlement this is probably the case and you must submit form 982 "Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness" write in the amount forgiven that your credit card company took off your debt on line two and file it with your tax return. You will need to provide a credit report showing your total debts compared to your assests and then you will not owe any taxes on that money.  I had to do this after the fact, since the IRS wanted to charge me taxes on the money I saved on settlement. it is best to be proactive in this case

rzGRsKAiaa	16 is a hard age for employment.... I would say (for now) to pursue some of your other interests.  Look for a job somewhere you would like to spend a lot of time and get paid for it.  Being a shop assistant really is not that bad, especially compared to the other jobs readily available to underage workers (food industry) and there are perks for working in retail - discounts and bonuses, etc.    If there are any community programs reaching out to kids, after school programs etc... you may be able to get part-time work there supervising or organizing activities.  If the programs are concentrated on art or self expression, this may be an outlet for you to practice with film production or photography and give you some good connections when ever you begin to sell or publish your creations :)|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Culver's minimum hiring age is 14 with a workers permit.    I called many stores because I am 14 looking for a job. This was the response they gave which makes me happy after looking for so long.    Find a local one go online and apply and go in store to apply or call and ask if they are hiring.      What I did was Google a bunch of business near my home and found their numbers using Google maps or their sites and I called and directly asked if they are hiring and what age do they hire at.    Try local grocery stores, pizza parlors, retail stores, fast food restaurants.|`|lxSRIFK2aa	mcdonalds|`|gWYArJ0Haa	MCDONALDS!! haha. you will find alot to do there.. it gets interesting when they make you scrap the 3 year old grease on the floor!|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	get a fast food job|`|3jhLIUKyaa	BE a cook at a fast food place like my  bro|`|zGcUxFzpaa	Hey there, I know this may sound annoying for you to hear because i can understand that you want something to do with film and tv.. i used to really want to do something like that a couple of years ago when i was your age.  Because you are 16 its going to be a limitation because you are still quite young. the only jobs that can be on offer for you really are waitressing or being a shop assistant. Maybe it would be good for you to start off doing something like this to gain some experience whether it be part time or full time.  If your going to college concentrate on that. Maybe consider taking a subject on film and tv. Such as media studies, drama and theatre or performing arts.  Better to have a job than no job id say, looking at the situation with the credit crunch and so on.|`|Ilme3c41aa	There are a lot of potential issues for children in work, many of them legislative, moms and dads have to be watchful about that. One thing you could try is making cash from multiple streams of income, check out the resource in the box below.
Gun3UGzaaa	It means they are offering you more time to pay the bill.  They are hoping you will fall for it and allow them to tack on more interest onto your bill.  Review the annual percentage rate you are being charged and decide if it is worth it.  For example, if you owe $1,000, and you have an interest rate of 18%, it costs you $180 a year to have that balance unpaid.
AA11284831	YOU have no recourse as it is not YOUR problem.    The employee is primarily responsible for verifying that enough tax was withheld.  If the company messed en-masse they might face some penalties from the IRS but the employees are the ones who actually owe the income taxes and they will have to pay them.  They have no recourse against the company nor does the company have any liability to them.    If the IRS levies a penalty she should ask to have it abated.  The IRS will frequently abate penalties upon request if the taxpayer has a reasonable position.  Any interest will have to be paid though; the IRS cannot abate interest that accrues from underpayment of tax.|`|8bh0IGwJaa	Unfortunately, it is up to her to figure that stuff out.  She can appeal and speak with them, and push the issue, but really, its on her shoulders.    She still actully owes the money that she hasn't paid.      What I'm fairly sure of is that if she OWES money, she can pay it off in installments.  Not one big sum.    Don't sweat it; we all have to pay it.  If she hasn't been paying the same as everyone else, then she needs to pay it.  She cant get out of paying it b/c the employer messed up.  Sure, they are in the wrong, and that sucks, but that doesn't mean she doesn't owe the money.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	If she ends up having to pay a penalty because too little was paid in during the year, she may have grounds to appeal the penalty as being no fault of her own, but the IRS may not care, it's the taxpayer's responsibility, not the employer.|`|AA10465540	There is nothing to become stressed over.  She may have to pay in a bit, but it probably won't be so much as to break her
QoVL5cDHaa	You have posted on both the UK and USA sites, so I am answering for the UK.  Whilst it is the employee's responsibilty to check that the correct tax code is being used, tax office doesn't usually send out coding amendments for budget uprates, so your friend may have had nothing to make the check against, and may have had no reason to suspect any underpayment. If this is for all the employees, it seems the employer has made mistakes. You don't say what measures employer has proposed to collect underpayment. He isn't allowed to take it in a lump sum. At best, he should put affected employees on a week/month 1 code number basis, and tax office will send a computation at the end of the tax year. Your friend would then have a restriction in her code number to collect the tax over the 2010/11 tax year. It wouldn't be done in time for the year 2009/10.  I wonder how this multiple error was found out? Would it have been by a HMRC investigation? If so, the employer is made to pay the shortfall, but there is nothing to stop him asking the employees for long-term reimbursement. Your friend could ask tax office if onus can be put on employer, explaining situation, and showing copies of any communications from employer.  A lot will depend on how employer's error arose. Employers usually get away with it if it is a genuine mistake. Carelessness or deliberate evasion results in a clampdown.|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	This needs to be sorted out between your friend and the tax man - it's now out of the employer's hands.    This shouldn't be too much of an issue.  She should simply fill in a tax return in April.  She will need her P46 (or P45 if she leaves this job between now and April), and of course those for previous years if it has been going on for longer than one tax year.  She'll also need any other relevant documentation such as P46s from second jobs.    This will then help her to figure out how much she owes the tax man, and if it's not too much, she simply sends them a cheque.  If it is a large amount, then it's possible that they could come to some arrangement regarding paying it back in instalments.|`|3IfBUUH0aa	All that will happen is that her tax payments going foward will be slightly higher for the next year to allow for a catch up of the back tax.    No-ones going to send a bill saying 'pay it now or go to prison'|`|9f8XoDKJaa	They should get the tax code from the Goverment.  She can contact the government or ask her employer to check.    here is a good link|`|12a37bf38f7fb21bfefcd10a348ca1beaa	.Do not worry THIS HAPPENS. First the employer is TOLD what to take to match your code number.IF that has been done right, then the tax office will check, and if they have been taking too much, your friend will get the over paid amount refunded, and probably a new code number.With 300 people being involved, an urgent visit to your local income tax office is urgently needed, the firm may be at fault and the tax office may not know. LET THEM SORT IT OUT. Her employer does not need to know about it.|`|at3fTytsaa	I'm afraid that the responsibility to check that your employer is operating the correct code number rests squarely with the employee. I know thi sis not what you want to hear, but your friend will have to refund the underpaid tax. As so many people are involved, I would imagine that HMRC will reach an agreement for the tax to be paid back over time - also depends on the amount involved.|`|AA12312371	he should get a tax rebate in april. dont panic!!|`|edb8091d08e70995c94b8aaf70084a4eaa	just have them to take extra money out of her check for taxes. like with me i have them to take a extra 50.00 dollars out in taxes. it also matters somehow how she claims if its 0 or one. and someone in payroll should be able to answer to that, she just probably talked to some assistant that does not know the correct answer. she has to tell them to put someone on the phone that does know.
7VuKSI0uaa	Each company will be different.  Their unique corporate culture will ultimately define the group.  Have worked several places that were competitive to the point of being ridiculous, but I have finally found my niche.  Give a place a few years and if you do not like it go someplace else.
z88IMXNFaa	Slim is right.  I would just add that you should make an appointment with a bankruptcy attorney.  The initial consultation will be free.  An attorney can give you a definite answer as to whether you qualify for a complete discharge.|`|cLtzGveRaa	That's a lot of debt for such a small income.  If you only have $50 per month after you pay your bills to put on debt there is no way in hell you will ever pay it off in full.  So, if you don't, you take your last 50 bucks and toss it onto a medical bill and have nothing left over, you have two delinquint credit cards that will be on your report anyway for the next 7 years and a medical bill that will likely report derogatory in the next few months.  Meanwhile, you're broke down to the last penny and still dealing with the collection agents who will begin to call.    Bankruptcy sounds like a decent option to me in light of all that.      Note:  Keep the papers forever.  Zombie debt is a killer.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	The bankruptcy laws changed, it doesn't get you out of debt, but simply forces a restructuring of what you have to pay and the time you have to pay it.    So whatever you can work out on your own is better than bankruptcy.|`|5BTKscZraa	The first answer is completely wrong. You can still file for BK and get most debts discharged.  You have to pass a "means" test to qualify for Chapter 7...which translates that your income most be below the average for your state. I think that you would certainly quality.    Chapter 7 may be in your best interest here.    VERY IMPORTANT: You can only file for Chapter 7 once every eight years....not every time you get into financial trouble....so if you file, just remember that you can't file again for 8 more years.    If you do file, make sure that you are fully covered with health insurance after you file....An expensive medical emergency shortly after filing for Chapter 7 when you don't have health insurance would be a disaster. Get state medicaid if you qualify.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	As long as you are making payments towards your medical bills, they can not really do a lot to you.  What is worse is the two credit cards that were canceled.  In your case, I would file for bankruptcy just to get out of the medical bills and your credit cards that you can not pay.  Then take some of your freed up money and get health coverage.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	$18,000 in medical bills at $50 a month will take you more than 30 years to pay off.  If you add in the other $6,000 in credit cards, you are talking about 40 years.  So, on paper any way, you are bankrupt.    What really matters is your overall income situation and whether or not it stands to get significantly better.  For example, if you only earned $18,000 this year due to illness and/or school, but you will earn $40,000 next year, then bankruptcy might not be the best option.  Also, if you are married, and your spouse contributes a lot of money to household expenses, you might not want bankruptcy.    So, put together a decent budget and meet with a bankruptcy attorney.  If it makes financial sense, then do it.  But, as someone else wrote above, make sure you have good medical insurance before you do.  this is your one chance for at least eight years to start fresh.
Q6QW4GxHaa	PayPal Shipping doesn't let you do the flat rate boxes. Your best bet is to use the USPS site to print those.    I would not recommend adjusting the weight to get the right cost. You could have problems if the weight on the label doesn't match the actual weight, even if the cost is right.
2lqqwmyraa	yes it is hard to get into the medical coding field, everyone wants experience,  you would most likely have to start from the bottom, like a medical receptionist or in medical records scanning charts.,, you will probably be better off doing the rad tech program, it will pay better, and you wont need experience to get hired.  I also considered going into a rad tech program because I was so discouraged at not being able to find a coding job, but I finally got a good coding job due to my 2 yrs of medical office experience,  It can be boring, you'll be sitting at a computer all day,   I don't mind it because it's a laid back office and i'll eventually have the option to work from home, plus I'd rather not deal with patients, just depends on your personality.  the pay for a rad tech will on average be about 10K to 15k more per year starting out,, good luck
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	It doesn't matter whether or not you have a written agreement. If he has your information, he can indeed sue you for any rent currently due and  last month's rent. In most states you are required to give 30 days' notice. Unless you are prepared to go to court and fight a judgment, but how can you prove that you didn't owe him rent? You can beat him to the punch and sue him if he has neglected your apartment to the point that it is unlivable, but you'll have to hire a lawyer (if you prevail, you can get him to pay the lawyer's fees.)  As soon as you are late on rent in many states he can begin the eviction process which takes 30 days. You do not want an eviction on your record; it will look bad on your credit report and could keep you from being able to rent, also many potential employers look at your credit.     If you are that unhappy, you may just want to consult with a lawyer and be proactive about the situation. If it isn't worth it to you to do so, you might just want to put up with it, see the light at the end of the tunnel, and leave, no harm, no foul. And next time, sign a lease for your own protection as well.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Sure, he can get you kicked out because you're trespassing.  There's no lease, so he can't go to housing court to enforce the lease.  He can't go to small claims court because there's not contract.  He can only go to the police because you're trespassing.   The police will tell him (because they're not stupid) to get a lawyer and go to court.  OR the police might issue you a summons for trespassing.  In which case, you will be assigned a court date which can be postponed by you at least 3 times.  That gives you a few months.  But since you're moving home anyway, and the place is a dump, and the landlord is a slum lord, just do as you've been doing.  The landlord knows all that I have said here, he knows the score.  If he asks, tell him your moving, that might get him off your back.  He'll be glad to get rid of you so he can fleece someone else.  Good Luck.  ps - don't pay any more.  keep it all.|`|AA11215123	You can be sued and evicted and you could have your wages garnished and bank account attached. It would go on your credit report and hurt your credit for quite some years.|`|1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	Wow, as classy as the whole situation sounds, since you didn't sign a lease and you're month to month, if the doesn't receive rent for May by May 1st, he can kick you out.  You have no standing contract in the form of a lease so what's stopping him?  Either pay your rent or leave, but there's not legal precedent that's going to protect in case you don't.|`|ZNCGui3eaa	Be careful, if you singed a contract and if you do not follow the terms, that is called 'bridge of contract' and you can be legally persecuted. Unless you have a good reason to break it. My advise will be, to reason with your landlord first and try to come out with a solution that you both will be happy with.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	Hope you don't want to rent another property in the next six years.  Legal actions like an unlawful detainer goes on your credit report and will follow you where ever you go.  Expect that your FICO score to drop into the crapper, but considering you unethical attitude it probably already is.
fShlKEfYaa	It's corporate culture. I worked at a company and they insisted that you would be connected to instant message all day long. If you weren't on instant message or if you were in a meeting and didn't type on the computer, a manager would ping you to say they didn't see you on instant messenger. It got so that the work and participating in meetings was secondary to making sure the instant messanger was always active. Managers come around their colleagues and team member's cubicles, because they're just people who have need for human contact. What might work for you is that everytime the manager comes by, get up out of your chair and stand in the hallway and talk to the manager about the work and accomplishments. See where the conversation goes and follow the manager's lead on the conversation. Eventually the manager will probably feel they are pulling you away from work everytime they come by the cubicles and they will leave you alone more.|`|7VuKSI0uaa	The corporate culture has made that practice required/acceptable.  Look for a new job.  I used to work at a place that was exactly as you describe, but i changed to a new company and the management style is completely different.

811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	You need to wait until the other auctions end and the bidders realise they haven't got the car they wanted.  Then they will come looking at yours and thinking....hmmm...lets make an offer there.  You will already have made notes on what each bidder bid for the other car(s)  so you will have a fair idea of what they are willing to pay up to.  This means making a note of the bids that were placed on the other auctions and by whom, including the bids that didn't win.

Just wait for the 1st one to finish, then relist if no bids.    You may still be able to end the 1st auction if it has more than 12 hours left.

There will be papers that tell you who the lender is and who's name the properties are under.    If he/she "gave" them to you legally and didn't pay them off then the bills are your responsibility. You can't ask the banks to take you off the properties or stop calling. You owe them money!

G9hY2LvIaa	That is a loaded question because your credit score is based on paying things on time as well as the amount of credit you have.  First, you need to be on time and current on all cards. If you meet requirements of this, look at your balances and see if any of them are near the maximum.  Any card where you have over 50% of the maximum should be paid down first.  If all your balances are less than 50% of maximum, then pay off/on the one with the lowest balance. If you're able to pay one off, then add the previous payment of that card to the payment on your next lowest card balance.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Actually, who cares about your credit score in this case.

RNZUwUEmaa	You can work up to 16 hours as a single person with no dependants and you will be allowed a 5 disregard on JSA. A disregard means all but 5 of your earnings is taken into account off your allowance.    If you are a lone parent and your youngest dependant is 12 or over you can again claim JSA and work upto 16 hours but they allow a 10 disregard. If you are claiming JSA however you are still expected to seek  work over 16 hours. If your child is under 12 you can claim IS and still work up to 16 hours and 10 disregard but you are not obligated to find work.    For couples they can work up to 24 hours between them however only upto 16 hours each with a 10 disregard between you.    Remember however if you do work over 16 hours you may be able to claim tax credits, housing benefit and council tax benefit however where no children are involved tax credits are age dependant and the hours conditions change depending on your circumstances.

jhNUuz0maa	I know the feeling. I have had plenty. The best thing you can do is when the boss gives you a task and then tries to tell you how to do the task, just tell him you know how to do it.

If your boss told you that you were incompetent or anything derogatory then he has created a hostile work environment.  If he did it in front of any other employees of the company it was slander and liable.  If this happened then you will want to log down the dates and times this happened as well as any witnesses you have and contact a lawyer.

The supervisor told me that mine was pulled aside and put into the error department due to my stimulus payment from last year not matching the number I am claiming this year. I was then told that as of this morning the error had been corrected and they have already gone manually through my return and my return is now back into the regular processing cycle. So, as explained to me, it is as if I filed and was accepted today. I was given the date of 2/24 because it is the normal 3 week maximum wait for a direct deposit efile. She then told me it could change and be earlier as the error has been corrected and my return is now in the regular accepted processing department.    Hope this helps you and all others who may face a similar problem. All we can do is wait.     I understand your frustration as my girlfriend was accepted on 1/29 and was given a DD date of 2/6 as of this morning. We both filed the same way through the same efile site.

xUYH1ttkaa	This was what I paid when I first moved out of the family home and into an apartment with my boyfriend:    Rent: 465  Gas: 150 (if you pay this per month even in the spring and summer you will be ahead once winter rolls in and your bills are over 300 bucks)  Electric: 50  Water/Sewer/Trash: 35  Phone/Cable/Internet: 150 (this is actually what I pay now, I have unlimited long distance, internet, and basic cable with hbo/cinemax/showtime)    Then you have to add in your car payment, insurance, and estimated monthly gas mileage (you should have an idea already of what you put in gas per month) if it applies to you. Also when I am budgeting I total up what our necessities are for the month (such as, shampoo, trash bags, laundry soap, etc..) This is a really great question to ask, I was not prepared when I first moved out on my own. But I managed it just fine. I decided to cut our bills into quarters and pay weekly instead of a bunch of huge bills once a month.

I was paying $1200 a month in my first apartment with a girlfriend.  But everything is inflated where I live.      Utilities are hard to estimate.      What me and my ex did was pretty good idea.  I payed for all the utilities and cable and she payed for the groceries.      Be sure and set some rules about who is responsible for what.       When you move in to the apartment, be sure and take loads of pictures of the place or take a video of it.  They always try and screw you out of stuff.

AjFA8qIxaa	Well, its not false advertisment since you know it will be rounded off when you pay cash, but is it legal to charge on person this price and another that price? I mean what you're tellling me is you get 'punished' for paying cash.  If everyone knows the prices are rounded off, why make prices like that??? Why not just sell the pack for $2?   This way its fair to everyone.|`|AA12074269	If you purchase 2 then you would only have paid $3.95|`|nMzzwrtUaa	no its not false advertisement for the main reason your not allowed to charge a card extra just to round it off. your allowed to do it with cash to keep from having to give change and having to keep change the the register.|`|OUpTuS14aa	False advertising? Sorry, but that's not false advertising. When you pay cash, the amount is being rounded off by the retailer, with no authority from the company, who advertised the product. However, when you use the card, you are paying directly to the company electronically, so they can't overcharge you or that would qualify as false advertising.  That's p-robably because in Australia the lowest currency unit (a penny?) is too low in purchasing power to be of any actual use, and so the retailer saves himself the trouble of having to stock lots of them to return change.  If you have exactly $1 and 98 cents, you can pay that much and won't be asked to pay $2.

This agreement must be provided to you at the time of application and then when the lock-in status changes (i.e from floating to locked).    If your broker claims that he/she locked you loan on a 30-day, they should provide you with a lock-in agreement from the brokerage office or directly from the lender with the date of such lock. If he/she can't provide you with this agreement, then they are clearly playing a game on you.    You have the right to demand an honest and fair dealing and if not, move to another broker or lender.

It comes across as arrogant. At this phase, you want to show that you are a pleasant person to be around, positive thinking, etc.    You've made it to the 4th interview, so obviously your qualifications are not an issue. They are most likely at this point just figuring out what personality fits best with the company. I'd guess that this interview will be mostly about personality and character. Asking that question would be a bad mark on both.

If you can't afford the house in 15 years, then you probably shouldn't be buying it.      I have a 15 year mortgage on my house that cost $47,000.  my interest rate is high 7.35% due to my having no credit at the time.  Right now I pay $432 per month and $157 of that goes on principle.

AA11639059	It is possibly the worst of times to be investing in the stock market, unless you know what you are doing. And if you are trying to trade/speculate your way "to financial freedom" then you may as well buy lottery tickets or visit a casino. The odds aren't good at gambling and the odds of a novice making it big in the market aren't much better.    As for being bad at saving, if you invest then you have a worse problem, for investing is a specific term, a long term, as you will be parking some of your financial worth in something and leave it for a year or more. To do that, however, may I suggest you search for major companies (frequently profitable companies I hope) that have direct purchase or dividend reinvestment plans. When you buy some, simply forget it, count the money as gone as if you turned it into a brick in the wall of your home. When you have sufficient extra cash, though, you might buy more, if the company is staying profitable in the meanwhile.

He will tell you what the latest prices for that type house in that area. Say for instance you are attempting to purchase.

He has been RELEASED from the LIEN from this UNPAID debt, not from the debt itself. He still owes the money but the IRS is giving up on collecting it.    The IRS has 10 years from the date the debt was incurred to file liens on it, meaning it could decide to refile the lien between now and 2012.

WzKrZoHQaa	It is the bank card you are give which basically guarantees the cheque to the value of the hologram on back of card.  It will say 50 / 250 / 500 etc.  You are not allowed to write a cheque out for more than the guarantee so you may need to write 2 cheques out to cover full value of item.  Basically the seller of the item is covered by this guarantee that the bank WILL pay / honour this cheque because it has your personal guarantee on reverse.   It stops you bouncing the cheque.  If you do wqrite a cheque knowing you have no funds to cover it then it is fraud anyway.   The bank will charge you for writing and basically telling you something you already knew (but it's how they make money) PLUS there will be a charge for going overdrawn without agreement in place.  Also it does not help yr status with the bank as it stays on yr bank record .  If you don't have a bank cheque card then you cannot write the cheque.       Go to the Post Office and ask for a Postal Order - there will be a small charge.  You can get crossed or uncrossed so you will need to check which one the receiver would like.  The crossed postal order MUST be paid directly into a bank account and will take as long as chq to clear.  An uncrossed Postal order can be cashed at any post office with simple ID     Hope this helps|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	As Qingda says, the number on your plastic card.

It is normally used so that the the bank has to honour the cheque even if you don't have funds.    Often it has an amount around 200 or 300 written in the little sqare shiny thing that I forget what thats called.    You don't see so many around nowadays and frankly if you write your own number yourself then this voids the guarantee.    If the person your paying won't accept the cheque as is then how about postal orders as an alternative or indeed a bank transfer to their account.    good luck

Unilever, which also reported a 58 percent gain in fourth- quarter profit today, slid the most in almost four months in Dutch trading. Much has changed between December and now, Polman said. We have to operate the business with common sense.     In this present climate of great uncertainty and volatility how much credence can you put on any forecasts let alone a ten year forecast.  Obviously you can find some exceptions to this rule, for example Autonomy Corp is a company whose software is used so much by the banking industry that I can't see any bank or financial institution jumping ship at such a critical period. I expect their earnings to grow by 25%+ year on year for the next five years, beyond that you will probably have to wait until there are some positive signs of an improvement throughout the global economy- whether today's  jump in the Baltic Index points to a bottom appearing in the market well your guess is as good as mine, but it looks encouraging.

rFV3UDnTaa	Hi June,    With respect to some of the other answers here that are encouraging you to let your bank foreclose, I'd like to suggest that there is a better way. But of course you already know that because you're asking about loan modification.    If you've gone to your bank on your own, as it seems that you have, and they've turned you down you're certainly not alone.    A lot of banks, even though they are desperate to avoid foreclosures because the economy is so bad, still haven't exactly seen the light yet. Meaning, they don't just want to give you a loan modification without making you work for it.    Now this may not be exactly what you want here, but if you have someone on your side who does this all the time, day in and day out, and knows how to make the banks pay some serious attention, you can really increase your chances of being successful.    As with many things where you're dealing with lenders or banks, they're not going to take you seriously unless you have some legal expertise behind you.    There are a couple of resources that I suggest you take a look at:    http://ezinearticles.com/?Loan-Modificat...    and    http://www.squidoo.com/loanmodification1...    Both of these will show you a little bit about how a good lawyer can approach the bank and dramatically increase your chances of having success.    Understand and that I am certainly not an attorney, and this is not legal advice, but I do know that it's a heck of a lot easier to have someone like this in your corner than to trying go it alone.    Especially when you're talking about something as important as saving your home, this isn't something that I would necessarily try a do-it-yourself quickfix on.    Just my 2 cents, but I'd seriously consider it if I were you.    Hope this helps.|`|BJERgbM5aa	In this bad economy, many are facing the same delemma.  Your own banks has the answer.  You need to do a remortgage.  This can be done.  The government has 2 or 3 new programs for people whose mortgage situation has become victims of the crunch.  The bank has all the info on these programs and will share it with you.  There is no reason why the shouldn't.  After all, if they forclose on you, they'll own your property.  They are not in the property business.  They don't want your property. They just want to to pay mortgage payments.  Speak to them.  Or speak to any bank.  Good Luck.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	You need to be able to pay for the house after they modify it, other wise you are just wasting time.    You need to get a job immediately or just let them foreclose.       They will not modify your loan if it is obvious they will still have to foreclose it, there is no point to that.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	go to the bank and tell them to modify the loan|`|EXJfoGtAaa	You can't tell your mortgagee (lender) to do anything - only ask.  If you don't qualify for a loan modification, your choices are foreclosure, short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure.    realtor.sailor|`|NkqPHojFaa	go to your mortgage lender or find some online mortgage lender and fill up for qualify for loan modification.

After all your lender/bank  is in for profit and minimize their losses. Foreclosure is most likely the most expensive option for the your bank. There may be several options that may be available to you of which loan modification is one them. I would recommend that you contact http://www.MortgageNegotiationCenter.com and tell them your situation and see if they can give you some guidance on what you should do and what options may be available to you.|`|wR9EpDbKaa	Good day,  I am Mr Brown Walter, a reputable, legitimate & an accredited money Lender.

1CVOHoapaa	VAT varies. The standard rate used to be 17.5% it is now 15%. Fuel is rated at 5% soooooo.  For VAT at 15% divide by 115 and times by 100  For VAT at 5% divide by 105 and times by 100  For VAT at 17 1/2 % divide by 117.5 and times by 100.|`|28Pz8nt7aa	The way to understand this is that if the amount is inclusive the whole amount is equal to 100%+17.5% which is 117.5%.  Now you need to get back to the amount without the VAT (which is the 100%)  There are several ways to do this but one way is to find 1% then multiply by 100 to get 100%  So you divide your inclusive amount by 117.5% and then multiply by 100%.  As it is tricky to divide and multiply by percentages you take 117.5% as 1.175 and 100% as 1.  So an inclusive amount of 117.50 bcomes; 117.50/1.175*1=100  If you want to find the VAT element from the inclusive amount just divide by 117.5% and multiply by 17.5%.  Remember a percentage amount is an amount expressed as part of 100 (the whole). 17.5% = 17.5/100  There are other methods as I am sure other answers will show but just find one you are comfortable with and to make sure you are right just work backwards from your answer.  You will notice that 117.5 and 100 are both divisible by 25, therefore you could use 117.5/25=4.7 and 100/25=4  The calculation would then become 117.5/4.7 * 4=100  I hope this makes it easy to understand and to calculate.|`|1a6e641ed9d987f73b9eeff3805f12a6aa	The way I do it in our shop is to multiply the amount by 14.891% press minus and then equals on a calculator. This is for VAT at 17.5%    When I have a list of prices from which I want to deduct VAT I set it up in Excel so that when I type in the price that includes VAT it automatically comes up in another box with the VAT taken off. Again I use 14.891% in the formula.|`|AA11510511	Well VAT is now 15%.    But in your calculation. , youw will need to multiply the cost by 0.825, which will give you the price before VAT.|`|fynzkVK4aa	multiply it by 0.825

You don't want to go over 10 per hour because a registered child minder costs less than that, and they're actually qualified.    Regarding travel; The bus fare there no, the taxi home, yes.

c3186f0f5c64761229ed6a56a18a85bcaa	I know how you feel.  One thing you might check into is a credit counseling agency.  They can work with your revolving accounts, like credit cards and get your payments down a little bit on them.  Look in the yellow pages in your phone book.  Can you refinance your car?  That's another option you might want to check into.  Would you be able to pay off your mortgage if you sold your house for the 390K?  If you can rent for less than 3200 a month then you might want to consider selling and renting until you get back on your feet.  Another option is to try to find a second job.  Something part time or doing sales.  If none of the above options work for you then here's what can happen.  If you stop paying the credit cards, they will start calling you and bugging you.  You don't have to answer the phone, of course.  Most of them will keep the account for a while and then they'll call it a charge off and they'll sell it.  Whomever they sell it to will call you.  After a while they will want to settle for less than you owe.  Of course, your interest accrues until then.  Every now and then there will be a bank who will take you to court and put a lien on your house.  I speak from experience.  My husband was out of work for a few years and I just couldn't pay all of our bills.  I figured we needed a place to live and utitlites and food more than we needed to pay the credit card bills.  Now, I've been paying settlements because we are in better shape financially.  Out of about 7 accounts, only one took it to court and put a lien on our house.  The plus to the lien is that there's no more interest.  I've settled with about 4 of the others and am making payments on one more.  I think there's only one that I haven't done anything with yet besides the one with the lien.  My point is, if you stop paying your credit cards, the world isn't going to end.  It might give you time to regroup.  Of course, our credit scores went down.  That's a given.  But, sometimes you have to decide which is more important, food or credit score.  If you don't pay your mortgage the house will get foreclosed on.  You'll have to move but you'll be out from under the payments.  Check your library or book store for a book called, "How to Sell Your House in 5 Days."  It might help you.  Good luck to you.  I've been there and it's not fun.|`|95dd309986ec51266e050e49cfa18452aa	Sounds like a nightmare! (sorry)  All I can suggest is either getting a roommate who is not ill and can work and help out with the bills??  Or you can file chapter 13 bankruptcy, keep everything you have and consolidate it all into one monthly payment.  Or your other option would be to hide under a rock or disappear somewhere.  I'm not trying to make fun of your situation but it sounds horrible.  Try not to let it get to you to much....  Take care and I hope you win the lottery!  Short sale and foreclosure would do you absolutely no good.  You will not benefit $ wise at all..|`|AA12065007	Sorry to hear about your troubles.    As much as I hate to advise this filing chapter 13 bankruptcy may be your only way out. You make to much money to qualify for chapter 7.    Or you might try Consumer Credit Counseling Services, they are free and will work with your creditors to lower your monthly payments and your interest rates. I used them several years ago and was debt free in 36-months.    Either way you can keep you home and vehicle.

(Note that there is considerable redundancy between the various volumes they offer.) These books provide detailed instructions for a wide variety of basic repairs, as do several of the previously mentioned books, but I find the HD books especially helpful because every product and tool mentioned in the books is readily available in the store. With other books, I sometimes find myself looking for an item that is hard to find (and therefore more expensive or aggravating to use, or even no longer code-compliant) or I only know the item by a name different from the one used by local suppliers. The HD books read more like a cookbook where you know that all the ingredients are waiting for you in one place, or a catalog with step-by-step illustrated instructions. Of course, I rarely need all the tools they recommend I buy for a given project-- don't go overboard on tools if you're just getting started. You can also consult a copy of these books in the store as you face an array of choices. (Of course, you can usually get excellent advice and personal instructions at your small local hardware store, if HD hasn't put them out of business yet. I do have some reservations about these "big-box" stores.)     On the other end of the spectrum, if you want more technical advice and are working on an antique home, I strongly recommend you go to: http://www2.cr.nps.gov/tps/index.htm (and the related site: http://w3.gsa.gov/web/p/hptp.nsf) and explore the many excellent free on-line resources there. While this is an essential resource for professional preservationists, there are many more basic materials there as well. Sometimes the approach encouraged by today's hardware stores and DIY books-- to rip out the old and install all new-- is the worst thing you can do to your home and its future value. The standard DIY guides show you *how* to do projects without considering whether or not you *should*. I'm currently undoing some skillfully-done "remuddeling" projects inflicted on my own lovely Victorian home by previous owners...       More input from FAQ Farmers:       I agree that the Home Depot or Lowe's books are both good. Check the public library as they usually have quite a feww. To really learn, go to Home Depot or Lowe's when they have their free clinics as you will get hands on practice and get to talk with someone who does it all the time. I have learned a lot at them.     There are now hundreds of home repair books on the market. Some are general information that cover everything, others are specfic to one type of problem/project (Build a Deck, Repairing Plumbing, Wiring 101, etc.) Try going to your library and looking up a few "Home Repair" books. You can see which ones you prefer and then buy them in the store or use the library's copy.     1001 Do-It-Yourself Hints & Tips : Tricks, Shortcuts, How-Tos, and Other Great Ideas for Inside, Outside, and All Around Your House     New Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual     The Big Book of Small Household Repairs: Your Goof-Proof Guide to Fixing over 200 Annoying Breakdowns     1001 Do-It-Yourself Hints & Tips : Tricks, Shortcuts, How-Tos, and Other Great Ideas for Inside, Outside, and All Around Your House by Readers Digest     Popular Mechanics Plumbing & Heating     Insulate and Weatherize: Expert Advice from Start to Finish     Home Heating and Air Conditioning System     Home Heating and Cooling (Fix It Yourself)     Home Depot-123 repairs

This time of year, the tax season is over. I agree with that part. However, once the tax season is over, the CRA lays off a large portion of their staff. I'd think it would take longer to process this time of year.    One thing I can tell you for sure. the CRA does not recognize any separation that is less than ninety days. So if you separated at the start of September and immediately sent notification of your change inmarital status, they won't process it.|`|Zn8A9vWdaa	That should not take too long, as the tax season is over.  You may do so online, call or write to them per the following contact info http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/cntct/menu-eng....    To be fair with the CRA, those people in the CRA who "like to give wrong answers to canadian questions"  are junior employees with very few yrs tax experiences, and they should not expect to answer complex tax questions.  However, there are certain specialised areas within the CRA organization (e.g., Rulings) that could give you more definitive "correct" answers.  If you have read the Cdn Income Tax Act, which is thicker than the telephone book and is full of long sentences and cross references, you may appreciate the complexity of any tax problem.  In fact, even the senior ruling officers (many are chartered accountants and some with the CA & law degrees combined) who are supposed to provide definitive correct answers on behalf of the CRA, are only good at, and responsible for, a few sections (out of about 260 sections) and regulations in the income tax act.    PS.  Oops.  Thanks to Quizzard pointing it out below, I misread your notes addressing the american readers after your question.  Sorry. On the other hand, I did read a few times comments from other people in this forum complaining the wrong answers that they got from the CRA.

AA12059806	From what I've read, if you really want a patent to go thru, you will need a patent attorney - it's not a quick fill-in the blank webpage process. There is a lot that goes into it. You're probably talking $1000's at a minimum.
AA12365277	Sure there is hype, but it is a nice place to live.    It is generally clean and safe, with a lot of activities, sports, museums, restaurants, parks, and downtown getting revitalized (and I think they are getting it right this time).  It has excellents schools.  It is a couple of hours to the beach, and a couple of hours to the mountains.  Unemployment is consistently lower than the rest of the state and much of the country, and the jobs we have can be very good ones - tech, biotech, government, and university (we have a lot of those).    I don't like the heat and humidity of a southern summer. And commuting traffic here can be pretty bad - not Northeast corridor bad, but bad.    $150,000 will not buy you much of a house or, at least, will limit your choice of neighborhoods severely.  The image of Raleigh as having affordable housing is a myth long-ago out-of-date.    There are a lot of former pleasant small towns that are becoming booming bedroom communities for Raleigh and RTP (Knightdale, Zebulon, Wendell, Fuquay-Varina, Apex), plus North Raleigh and Cary.  There is a bit of suburban sprawl, to describe it kindly.  Because commuting is difficult, pick the location to live based on where you plan to work, or vice versa.  I know people who live in Knightdale, east of Raleigh, who commute to RTP to work and spend an hour, or more, in their car each way.    Hope this is of some interest.|`|4e5091ebb829dd94409b7851f9629028aa	There arent many nice houses in the raleigh area that are in the price range. Raliegh is a nice area but is veryyy urban!

I immediately went to bank to deposit more funds and found out they had also charged me $8 per day for having a balance below zero. Cost me $59 to be $2.39 in the hole.    All I can tell you is keep a close eye on your balance and leave extra money in the account in case you make a mistake.|`|AA11140462	I would call up and ask the bank, it ususally gets charged every eight days or so. If you call the bak up, they might be willing to take the overdraft offf your account if you haven't had a previous on in a while.    I would say that you should go in the bank and ask them to reverse it this one time. Keep better check registers, leave a $100 buffer in your account that you don't accont for and this won't happen again.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	They only charge once per month, so the 28 will cover you for the whole month on that billing period, which would have been last month!|`|4hJJkfmpaa	Most of the time they will deduct it from your a/c at the end of the month
49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Your mother has to issue her a 30 day notice, in writing.    Have the city do a community service call and witness the eviction notice, and issue you a report number.    After 30 days, if she is still there, call the sheriff again and they will see her to the door.    The police, at this point, have to protect your sisters right to a legal eviction.    This method of eviction is legal if you own the home (why your mother has to do it) and the owner lives in the home.|`|AA11112154	What state are you in and what are the laws in your state? Is she paying rent? Did you have a formal employment contract with her? That's what it comes down to. You can put a notice of eviction on her door or mail a copy via certified mail so that she has to sign to get it and tell her she has 2 weeks to leave. If she doesn't you can go to the police. You need to follow the legal eviction laws in your state.    Good luck.|`|ePkiOzPSaa	I would think that legally you could give her whatever notice you want.  She doesn't have any written agreement on the fact that she can live there, and it isn't her house... you couldn't just walk into someone's house and start living there.  You may have to take it up with the police to have her removed if she continues acting the way she is.  It's not a great situation, but if she's already called the police on you (for what???), then you shouldn't have too much remorse.|`|ecmnS63Uaa	you can just call the police since it is your mothers house and they can forcefully remove her from the house , but it could cause a scene.|`|2yl8omcAaa	Wow, That is really tough question. If I am in your position, I would tell or ask my mom to call a police and report her. If she have no business there anymore and seems like she is not welcome due to her personality.     If she won't leave let the police to it for her.|`|f4kyqIILaa	If she's not paying rent there's no reason to do an eviction.  If there's no contract involving rent or housing for employment you can put her on trespass notice.  You need to talk with the sheriff's dept, an attorney and/or learn about the process yourself.|`|Xdsf2SOjaa	If there was never anything put in write, you don't have to give her a notice at all. Have the police get involved if necessary. They can physically make her leave if they have it.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	That premises has become your sisters residence and you have to go through the noral legal process to have her removed.    The first step in that process would be giving her a 30 day notice (in most states) to vacate the premises.  If she fails to vacate after 30 day the next step would filing an Unlawful Detainer action against her.  A 3 day notice is for non-payment of rent or to cure a broken covenant.    Trying to evict her in any other way could result in civil suit filed by your sister for unlawful eviction which could be very expensive for you and your mother.    This case requires an attorney that understand RE law and evictions.  At least in my state, there is no requirement for either a written lease or rental agreement unless the term of the lease is over one year.  A verbal contract (lease or rental agreement) is as legal as a written agreement and carries the same weight in law.

e909e2d121e65433cf316934930f84f3aa	Statute of Limitations     Credit cards are generally considered open accounts.  The Federal Truth in Lending Act, Section 127 talks at length about credit cards as open accounts. However I have received some information recently indicating that some courts have ruled that credit cards are written accounts. So, as I'm not an attorney, I'm going to suggest that this area of the law seems to be fluid. Meaning that what your court rules may be based upon what evidence is presented and other factors.   While the Federal Truth in Lending Act is written in legal terms, meaning good luck trying to read it, the The State of New Hampshires Department of Justice's Sourcebook has a very readable definition, check the second paragraph, of why credit card accounts are open-ended.

eb1320fc6cbef5a39e1f58280f7b8fe8aa	The Sensex is an "index". What is an index? An index is basically an indicator. It gives you a general idea about whether most of the stocks have gone up or most of the stocks have gone down.    The Sensex is an indicator of all the major companies of the BSE.  The Nifty is an indicator of all the major companies of the NSE.     If the Sensex goes up, it means that the prices of the stocks of most of the major companies on the BSE have gone up. If the Sensex goes down, this tells you that the stock price of most of the major stocks on the BSE have gone down.    Just like the Sensex represents the top stocks of the BSE, the Nifty represents the top stocks of the NSE.    Just in case you are confused, the BSE, is the Bombay Stock Exchange and the NSE is the National Stock Exchange. The BSE is situated at Bombay and the NSE is situated at Delhi. These are the major stock exchanges in the country. There are other stock exchanges like the Calcutta Stock Exchange etc. but they are not as popular as the BSE and the NSE.Most of the stock trading in the country is done though the BSE & the NSE.    Besides Sensex and the Nifty there are many other indexes. There is an index that gives you an idea about whether the mid-cap stocks go up and down. This is called the BSE Mid-cap Index. There are many other types of indexes.|`|Rt5wN2lraa	You can understand Sensex Read Business line and Financial Times Regularly.You will be master in all within  short period.You can.Study basic theory..and go on.....
ae45e32ea79f5e3e43a482979fbd7467aa	Hi - I am in the business of sourcing and manufacturing goods in China and importing them into the U.S. for my clients. It is possible for you to do it yourself but many things can go wrong so BE CAREFUL! Go to alibaba.com. There you can find hundreds of vendors in China selling tools (and everything under the sun). Keep in mind that you never know if you are dealing with the actual manufacturer or a trading company, so it is difficult to know if you're getting a good price. Also unless you are ordering large quantities (at least 5,000 pcs), most of these suppliers will not take you seriously. You will need to pay deposits up front, typically 30% down. If you are dealing with a fraudulent company then you may not see your money again or get your goods. If you are dealing with a so-called "gold" or "trust-pass" supplier then they will not have time for small orders. The first step is to get samples. The suppliers will typically provide samples for free but you will need to pay for shipping (e.g. FedEx).  If you get the samples and you like them, then the next potential pitfall is that you place an order for the same item but you get something different. This is a common occurrence. The supplier may not tell you that the model is discontinued and will simply send you the latest model even though it's different from the item you approved and paid for. Communications are another key issue. As a fluent Chinese speaker I can deal with communications, but still there are challenges. You will find that you ask very specific questions but get only partial answers to some questions. Information is difficult to come by, communications via email can drag on for weeks, and language barriers can cause costly misunderstandings. At first the person you are communicating with via email may seem well-versed in English, but if the discussion ever gets beyond the simplistic level and becomes more complex their English skills are typically inadequate. When I need important information from suppliers or need to tell them something important I always call them on the phone and speak to them in Chinese so there is no misunderstanding. Next you need to deal with international shipping, customs clearance, incoterms, etc. You will need a freight forwarder, and if you are inexperienced in dealing with these companies they will rip you off. Finally, assuming all goes well and you start placing orders, you need to beware of the "end of the honeymooon" syndrome. You may think you are spending a lot of money and buying a lot of product, but don't forget that this is China: your supplier wants orders for MILLIONS of pcs, not hundreds or thousands. They will quickly lose interest in your business if you do not give them substantial orders. Then you will find your orders sidelined and delayed because their other, bigger customers are pushing them for their attention. Working with an intermediary will result in an extra fee, but in the long run it will be less costly than trying to do it yourself. The tuition you will pay traversing the learning curve will far exceed the cost of a good sourcing/import agent. A good sourcing/import agent consolidates the demand from multiple clients/buyers and has much more leverage over suppliers in China than you as an individual have. Not to mention that sourcing and importing from China is itself a full-time job, and I assume you are in the business of selling and distributing tools, not importing, sourcing, QC, logistics, and all the administrative support that goes behind it.

60454cb06f878ee0bb39d7487ed3545baa	There are two main tracks you can take as a translator, an in-house interpreter or a freelance interpreter.    In-house translators usually work regular 8-5 jobs for a company and earn a salaried wage. Freelance translators, on the other hand, decide their own destiny and often follow the well-known "feast or famine" in terms of earning money.    There are no requirements to be a freelance translator (anyone can claim to be one), but clients look for different things when hiring translators, the biggest being experience. If you're interested in translating in a certain field, a degree in that field will be helpful in finding more clients.    In-house translation companies might have more stringent requirements, but the biggest one is once again experience.    Getting experience is probably the hardest thing for a freelance translator just starting out, but the translation field can be very rewarding and I personally wouldn't want to do anything else.

3FRhc8fsaa	Debt consolidation is an option, and you should look into it. Just be careful about WHAT you're getting into. Some plans, because of their higher APR rates get you into more trouble than you were.     Also, some lenders look poorly upon it later on. Some institutions believe that it really is a black mark. It will depend upon the types of deals that your particular company or lender work out, and of course, your own individual circumstance. For some with absolutely NO way out, debt consolidation is a welcome option.    Take a good hard look at all the options and plans offered, and don't let a single company pressure you into something you just can't do. Make sure that you're comfortable with the plan offered before you commit to it.    In any case, it doesn't hurt to investigate debt consolidation as an option. It doesn't cost you anything to find out more information about it.    If you want a place to start your investigating, there's information and listings for debt consolidation providers on the page listed below. You'll probably find something of use there:    http://axalda.info/debt-consolidation.ht...|`|fd121cf6d461629327dd7289b31cd202aa	PROSPER.COM|`|75ae1769bd601acf1a03c19d97bcc822aa	Bad credit debt consolidation loans are of two types:    1. Secured bad credit debt consolidation loans:    These types of bad credit debt consolidation loans are secured by a collateral usually some property or a guarantor. Since, the lenders find something to bank upon in case you default on payments, the interest rates on secured bad credit debt consolidation loans are cheaper, the lending amounts are higher and the repayment period can be long.    2. Unsecured bad credit debt consolidation loans:    Persons who do not have anything to offer as the collateral or security, can take unsecured bad credit debt consolidation loans. The lenders find themselves at increasing level of risk while giving such loans. The existing bad credit situation and lack of a collateral, make them charge high interest rates and offer low loan amounts to offset the risk involved. But, a person who has a bad credit and cannot provide a collateral has little choice, but to take these high interest loans. At least by repaying these the borrower can rebuild his credit history.    Deciding which bad credit debt consolidation loan is right for you can be a daunting task. Many companies offer free debt consolidation help to those who are cash strapped. It is good to take such advice because the professional expertise of such companies can help you decide better. Again, it's you who will have to be very cautious about the interest rates, repayment period, late payment penalties and other fine prints that come with the bad credit debt consolidation loans. Following the repayment schedule can help you write off the bad credit ratings from your credit history.  Read more from: http://www.credit-card-gallery.com/credi...

054700195cb747213185ade881523494aa	My friend is an entry level accountant at PWC. I also know a few other people who worked at big 4 companies. All of them had interned the previous summer with the big four company that later hired them in, following their graduation. Internship did not guarantee a job in the company though. If you failed final internship reviews, you were notified that the company would not be hiring you and promptly escorted off company premises. But it would seem, at least at PWC, that a large majority of entry level jobs were filled by people who interned at PWC previously.     Internship it seems would be the best approach. Unless you had phenomenal skills. And passing all your CPA exams would help, no doubt.
KZDth4LFaa	?hhm, wozu brauchst Du 750  fr Betten?  Du bekommst doch sicherlich Hartz 4 richtig?  Dann kannst Du das dort beantragen , jemand der kein Bett kaufen kann , kann auch keine 100 oder mehr zurck zahlen, definitiv nicht!  Schau mal bei Ikea, dort findest Du schon sch?ne Betten fr die Kids fr 37  und die dazugeh?rige Matratze fr 19,90 das mal 2 und wir sind bei ca. 120   Wo schl?fst Du denn jetzt?  Wenn du dir ansonsten nichts zu Schulden hast kommen lassen , kannst du Dir bei jedem Versandhaus Betten bestellen, wenn du sonst keine Schulden hast(und ich nehme mal an die wirst Du nicht haben , wenn du dich selbst?ndig machen willst, oder? )dort kannst Du auch auf Raten zahlen!  Funktioniert das bei Dir nicht , sagt das sehr viel ber Deine Zahlungsmoral aus und somit wird dir sicherlich kein Wildfremder Mensch 750  leihen der ein bisschen nachdenken kann!  Ich denke nicht das es dir tats?chlich nur um Betten geht , sorry ;-))    Gru?    P.S Ich habe mir mal Deine anderen Fragen angesehen, du scheinst gengend Schulden zu haben und kommst da jetzt schon kaum raus..................  Wieso gehst Du das ganze nicht einmal vernnftig an , melde dich bei der Diakonie in Deinem bezirk und lasse Dir einen Termin geben , dort sitzen Schuldenberater die mit Dir eine fr Dich TATS?CHLICH kostenlose Privat Insolvenz durchfhren!  Das solltest Du schon im Interesse Deiner Kinder in Erw?gung ziehen , das ist nichts schlimmes, ruf da einfach mal an !  Wenn du tats?chlich so dringend Betten ben?tigst , kannst Du dort auch Hilfe bekommen.  Aber bitte mache doch nicht noch mehr Schulden!

It is usually even safer to use than a debit/credit-card and you can set up both your debit/credit card or a direct debit from your bank account using your routing/account number from one of your checks.     If you check with e-bay you are much more likely to find someone who will accept payment through the mail, but you are doing this at your own risk because again, most people will not send your item until your check has cleared. At this point E-bay can't do much for you if they chose to keep your money and never send your item. |`|CDwTP0WSaa	yes paypal will help you shop online without using a credit card. just go to http://paypal.com and read their *HELP* pages to know more

AA10007793	This one probably doesnt mean much for the company.  It looks like it is held in trust by an investment advisor for their clients.  In other cases it depends on the reasons the stock is held.  When someone owns more than five percent of a company they have to file a 13-d.  This could be a precursor to a buyout.  Sometimes its called a toehold stake when a takeover buyer accumulates just less than 5 percent, before they have to disclose their holding.  Sometimes a buyer just wants to hold the shares for investment purposes and doesnt intend to buy more.  If its a takeover attempt it could move the stock up.
AA11284831	This isn't something that either of you can "ask" for.  The law determines if you are a dependent or not, not your or your parents' desires.    If you no longer lived in their home in 2008 (including going to school away from home temporarily) then they cannot claim you unless you earned less than $3,500 in 2008 AND they provided more than half of your total support for the entire year.    If they cannot claim you then you should file your return and claim your personal exemption.  If they have already filed you may not be able to e-file.  If that happens you will have to file a paper return by mail.  The IRS will then investigate the matter and award the exemption according to the law using the evidence that you both provide.    See IRS Pub 501 (available on their website) to see if you can be claimed as a dependent.  If you can not, you should let your folks know that you will be claiming your personal exemption and that they can no longer claim you under the law.  If they insist on trying to claim you they will lose.  If they get angry about that, that's THEIR problem, not yours.  If they don't like the law, they should take that up with their elected representatives, not piss and moan at you.|`|yw0amT5daa	well you're 19. if you're working and taking care of yourself then you're not a dependant anyway. they don't have a right to get angry if they've been falsley claiming you as dependant|`|1H7aNVT3aa	Unless you are a full time student OR if you made less than $3,500 last year they can't claim you anymore since you are not under 19.|`|oYFzfsReaa	I'd say go for it.

bYIigEKraa	Yes.  Most often its a transcription error.  If you believe this has happened, contact your bank immediately.  If the mistake was made into your account you will be held accountable if those funds are withdrawn and your account becomes overdrawn.  If you made a deposit that did not make it into your account, bring the receipt/ticket from the deposit and your last bank statement and speak to a manager.  The latter happened to me, and was resolved in less than five minutes.|`|X4hz3a9haa	yes, human error happens|`|Mycu2Nsoaa	I went to cash my payroll check at the bank where the check came from, and they deposited it into someone's account.

Not sure if that would happen with tax refunds (which I believe check the name on the account), but could happen with other transfers.|`|BCM9ziD2aa	Yes, this can happen, it happened to me years ago. I went to an ATM to check my balance and my balance was 5k. I knew that was not "my" balance, so I called the bank, they told me that this was the actual balance on my account. I didn't touch the money for months, but after it remained in my account, I begin using it, hey, I figured what the heck, I needed the funds. (LOL)  Long story short, it ended up that the funds belonged to my uncle who has the same last name and his account number was one number off from mine. When he finally checked his balance and noticed that his money was not there, he went to the bank, who had to reimburse him because it was their mistake, they also informed me that I would have to pay back the money, which I did not do because it was "their" mistake which in the beginning I did call them to inform them of. I'm assuming that they knew I really didn't have to pay for their mistake, but it was worth a try to scare the pants off of me to get the money back. Well that's my story, first time I ever received such a nice monetary gift!!!!  Wish another would come along soon...this recession is killing me!|`|CU7yipOuaa	Yes- it happened to me. The teller thought one of the account numbers was an 8 when it should of been a 3. Lucky, I caught it since the balance didn't make sense.

meK0ziCJaa	That most likely not work.     I respectfully disagree with the previous poster. Paying your bills can not be a bad thing. What matters in a situation like this is your date of deliquency. That will never change.    If she pays what she can, even if it's not what the collection agency wants, the agency most likely will not send back the money. If they do (which I'm betting they won't) take the money and pay monthly or every two months. It's not what the agency wants, but it's what she can afford and at least she's trying to make payments.     Not paying your bills can only lead to a worse situation.|`|cLtzGveRaa	No.  And that might even make things worse.  How old is the debt?    Edit:  At three months she's in a position of less power.      The concept of "just send $5 a month and they can't sue you" is a myth.  If you default, they can sue unless they can make more reasonable arrangements.      She could, if in a position where bankruptcy is plausible, bluff them to get a lower payment.  She may, at only 3 months past due, be able to work something out with the original card company... perhaps get on a hardship program.      My advice to her would be to talk to a credit counsellor and, with full details of her situation, they would be able to help her decide what her options are.      Please note:  A debt settlement company is NOT the same thing as a credit counsellor.  Get an NFCC certified counsellor.

AA10958272	There's NO business sense to it.. and it's been challenged and debated across at least 3 decades now. You can say that a Lee Iaocca had an impact -- as a leader, manager, lobbyist, PR focal point and motivator let's say for example...and the same rings true for Steve Jobs (pre-'09) and many other iconic business CEOs you can readily name. But, the CEO of (insert name of corp.) in no way deserves 10s of millions.. and many times, they're not even working 5 days a week, or a full day at that... they're essentially face people. Their staffs report to them, and they decide or head-nod. Maybe he or she's made a name, somewhere else -- and by "name", I mean was on TV sitting beside Maria Bartiromo, etc. and yapping about projections & the market & how/why they should do better, etc. and being placed in print/mags and getting the Corp. name seen/read.. in the faces of investors. That's all it is.. an expensive PR GAME with media & stock pickers/investors. Something to talk about. Outside of earnings. For Ex. -- Does Ford need a Ford et. al. at the top? how about if it simply sold a car that they do, say in Brazil that can get 40-50+ mpg on a hybrid engine for the last 5-6 years? (naaaaaaaaaw)     This whole topic was given a 2nd life with the popularity of Jack Welsh, I believe.. the celebrity CEO that believes his own press-clippings. Superhuman manager that can spin a phrase or a concept and have heads nod, even beyond his own fiefdom. ("yes, we must cut the underperforming 10%") etc. etc.     It's nonsense.    Of the 100s of MBAs I've met.. I can see the frat boy underneath, additionally. The cancun partying, and well-connected family or neighborhood ties... daddy or uncle or old college bro... that brings you in -- and UP, UP, UP you go (for the most part).

Hope that helps. :0)|`|NZuJR79oaa	2    EBIT is earnings before interest and tax.  So tax liability and interest is out.     Cash dividends are paid with after tax money. So Depreciation is left.     Your textbook has this information, You really do need to learn this for the test ( and any subsequent job in finance)|`|2a018170ff75d363213a98baeae86b10aa	EBIT stands for Earnings Before Interest & Taxes.  I'm used to using EBITDA which is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization.    Using EBIT, the Earnings mean Net Earnings of earnings after expenses.  The expense number you should be using is Total Expenses less Interest & Taxes.    In your question you would want to subtract 3) Interest Expense and 4) Tax Liability (assuming that the tax liability account is an expense account and not a balance sheet account) from you TOTAL EXPENSES not total revenues.
sI3krJULaa	True.  Depreciation seeks to allocate the cost of a fixed asset over it's useful life- it ties in with the realization principle- we're supposed to realize income and expenses when they're effectively spent.  Just because we pay 50,000 for a tractor in one day, doesn't mean that we're actually using it all in one day.  So we "use" that 50,000 over 5 years, since that's how long it's expected to last (for tax purposes).

I'll frame up my answer so you'll understand where I come from on this:  I'm an HR Manager focused on recruiting for a small company that is hiring sales professionals - right now.  The person that came on board I hired from a job fair.  So no, job fairs are not a waste of time.    You are in a job market that I was in the '80's and I can attest that it's frustrating.  I've been around the block a couple of times, so take this as constructive information:    *There are a lot of people out of work, 650K more this week alone in the US), and job creation is at a virtual standstill.  Your in a highly competitive market.      *Your degree in advertising and marketing is focused in an area that a lot of companies are just simply not interested in investing right now. They are in preservation of capital mode.    The short answer is that there is no single solution to your search.  Coming from a recruiters point of view, consider:    *continuing to be confident that you will ultimately do the work you are passionate about - but maybe not the next job.    *Build a robust network - it's honestly how some of the best matches are made.    *Don't come across as entitled because of your degree.  Be entitled because of what you can bring to the table of value to the company.    *If you choose to stay true to the path of advertising and marketing, consider taking a job for a target company or agency that is hiring entry-level and out of your focus.  It doesn't mean you are throwing away your degree, it means you are willing to be flexible, which is what companies are in need of right now.

Hang in there...it sounds like they are going over all returns claiming stimulus or not.|`|z2Yk76RAaa	I talked to the IRS 5 times and finally got a supervisor. Mine was accepted on 1/17 and had an original date of 1/30, mine too as of this morning has been pushed to 2/24. The supervisor told me that mine was pulled aside and put into the error department due to my stimulus payment from last year not matching the number I am claiming this year. I was then told that as of this morning the error had been corrected and they have already gone manually through my return and my return is now back into the regular processing cycle. So, as explained to me, it is as if I filed and was accepted today. I was given the date of 2/24 because it is the normal 3 week maximum wait for a direct deposit efile. She then told me it could change and be earlier as the error has been corrected and my return is now in the regular accepted processing department.    Hope this helps you and all others who may face a similar problem. All we can do is wait.     I understand your frustration as my girlfriend was accepted on 1/29 and was given a DD date of 2/6 as of this morning. We both filed the same way through the same efile site. It stinks, but what can you do?|`|Qv51RS7Naa	I am in the same situation. Mine was originally scheduled for 2/10, now it says 2/17. I called and after waiting nearly an hour spole with a real person and she said that their refund hotline and their website was having technical difficulty, and that the date on there does not necessarily mean that is the correct date. My message said that my return was being processed, but the rep said that its possible it could take three weeks from the date it was received. Mine was received on 1/28, and so far there is no deposit date according to her. Who knows with the IRS. They can take their sweet time, but if you owe them money, they will assess their late fees and penalties. It's a bunch of crap.|`|rawyzd1raa	Wow to many big words

f2ed3822367474c8900c079212947690aa	All I can tell you is what happened to me. The first time I was late with my American Express charge account it was okay. I got charged a fee. The next time I was 1 or 2 months late, and Amex canceled my card. My credit score at the time was average - good. This was back in 2001. They don't seem to be that understanding to late payments. I had good on time payment history with them other than that. I even charged 3 plane tickets to Europe and paid them on time it didn't matter.    I wanted my American Express card reactivated. I understand it was my fault because I didn't take their policy that seriously. I actually liked that card a lot, and was sorry to lose it. The funny thing it wasn't like I couldn't come up with the money. I paid them and talked to the person on the phone and asked if I pay will my account come back? She said there was a good chance. I'm sure she knew I probably wouldn't get my Amex account back. They just wanted me to pay so there wouldn't possibly be an account that went into collections.     Like I said I know it was my error in being absent minded, and I take full responsibility for that mistake. If you like this account, make sure you don't miss your amex charge payments. I hope you can learn from my mistake. http://www.creditfast.com|`|pNy8lakjaa	If you didn't pay it in full they would probably add an interest fee for the amount owed. The higher still owed, the higher the interest tacked on will be.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	It depends on the terms and conditions in your contract.  Typically, they charge you a late payment fee of around $35 and they charge you interest.  It will also be reported as late on your credit score.  Being one time late isn't a big deal on your credit score. Being chronically late, such as 3 times over 6 months will hurt your credit score.    Check the fine print on your bill (especially the back) and it should spell out the penalties for not paying on time.    But, credit card debt is very expensive.  Try to keep paying in full on time.  It is good discipline and will save you a lot of money in the long run.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	why not call them and ask what would happen?
AA11404742	Got a lawyer you like?  I'd start there.    Or you may consider this:  A friend started a small business, and he went to the local student law clinic at the local law school.  This is pretty basic stuff - it happens thousands of times every year in any city of decent size, and I suspect that all lawyers cover this stuff until they can do it in their sleep.  He got the basics done, of setting up the business, getting licenses and tax forms filed, learning the record-keeping requirements, etc.  And he got it done for a few hundred dollars, since these were students instead of full-fledged lawyers.|`|13ab2eb08c3b29c7e124e905335006c0aa	if your selling something that you made or making and sell   later in your own business be sure to get everything copyrighted|`|COpP9JDqaa	Get a license and permit for the business, and get bonded and insured for damages.

I do work from home, but I did A LOT of research first. I was a banker for many years, and was not happy. The trip back and forth to work, bosses, pay, you name it. So, I started researching work from home ideas that I could use my skill with. I settled on Canyon as an Equipment Leasing Broker. Basically, I bring together people who want to lease equipment with those that want to lend money. Now, I am happier than ever, making more money than I ever imagined, and I do it from the comfort of my home. As I said, figure out what you are good at, do your research and take the plunge !

fShlKEfYaa	many companies do not send letter for unsolicited resumes and unsolicitied applications. Many companies never look at unsolicited resumes and do not respond, but others consider this a missed opportunity to make a good impression with a potential consumer and to build goodwill in the community. If you have a job advertised it is good public relations policy to reply to the person's email address that you have received their application and it will be forwarded to the hiring manager who will contact them if they have further questions. You can have a form letter for this, so it is quick to acknowledge by email the job inquiry. Some companies will only send out the acknowledgement letter once the job is filled to both acknowledge the resume receipt and let the candidate know the job has been filled.|`|cs4n4Fgzaa	No, it is not necessary to send a letter to every single applicant. It will become time-consuming and wasteful of paper. There are so many people who need jobs right now that they apply for work they are completely unqualified for. I recently had a job opening that had over 30 applicants but only 15 were even remotely qualified. We only send a "thanks but no thanks" letter to the ones we actually speak to, with either a phone screen or an in-person interview.

But a default of only the loan (or rollover of rest of account) simply triggers the taxable even and the 1099-R with no withholding.     Best thing to do is to set up a payment plan with the IRS.  They will charge a lower interest rate than a credit card.|`|HSB3grGcaa	Hello Dear    I am Peter White. A certified, reputable, legitimate & an accredited private lender.

My refund was delayed a week, and I checked this morning.  WMR confirmed that it was being deposited tomorrow, and even gave the reason why it was delayed, along with the adjusted amount of my refund.  I'm getting an extra $150.  Error in my favor is always good.    I've confirmed with Republic Bank, who handles the refund payment processing for TaxACT, and it is there, being sent to my bank, and should be there in the morning.    So yes, WMR is now working, and you should be able to trust it.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	I don't think so, and I think one reason it's not is the rebate recovery credit.

And, there's no 'best' company because if there was there'd only be one company.  And, DON'T assume that when coverage is offered through work that it's your best bet.

Many people are out of work and  uninsured for that reason. Be prepared for the bad news: Individual health coverage doesn't come in "good deals"-- it's typically extremely expensive to be insured outside of "group" coverage.  Hint: If you are a member of any large "group" that could possibly offer an insurance discount with their membership, check it out!  Individual groups (nonprofit organizations; national membership organizations) can cover you cheaper than your own policy under your own name.  Last resort: Marry into it. It's been done before.

Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes. Remember that the reps are bored. Very bored. Every person who approaches them is nervous; everyone has  prepared question or answers for them.   The best thing you can do is surprise them. Say something that no one else will say.  Ask them "Has anyone made you laugh out loud while you were interviewing them?"  Ask them "Do you have to talk to people all day or do you get a lunch break? Do you want me to bring you some lunch after we are finished talking?"  (say this even if you don't have ten cents to buy lunch for yourself).  Then ask what you could do to get hired today.  Then stop talking..|`|yazZH4khaa	Good eye contact, a firm handshake, and a confident tone in your voice. Do not talk too fast or you will look too nervous. This may look like, to the future employer, that you are not right for the position. Do not ask about pay right off the bat. Ask questions that will pertain to what you will be doing. Be a very good listener, and then your questions will pop into your head. Bring a notepad or briefcase and actually take notes, so when it is your turn to talk you will remember what to ask and say. Nerves help make us forget at times.
Gun3UGzaaa	Probably not.  If you do, do not say you left because "management was terrible".  The person hiring you is a boss and doesn't want to hear that you think bad things about the boss.  Maybe just say the business there was slow and couldn't give you enough hours to work.  Or, ideally, you say something like "I wanted to get a job in the ..... field because I want to become a ....  Your company has an outstanding reputation in this field, and I wanted to learn from the best."|`|y59sVhWUaa	Usually showing an employment span of one month at any one job doesn't sit well with a potential future employer if they see it on your resume because they see it as instability on your part. I have years f management experience myself.    I think that unless you got in good with someone (preferably someone in a management position) at your last job that will stand as a good reference for you then you should strongly consider leaving it OFF your resume because it will likely only hurt your chances in the end.
4MypYVHYaa	Each county is a bit different and, some are deed states and some are lien states. Depending on which is your state depends on the procedure your county use.    Check with the county and see what procedure is used and haw you can go about purchasing one. Some counties don't have auctions.    when you call the county make sure you speak with someone that know what you are speaking of. Don't get off the telephone until you have spoken with a person that knows about the tax lien sales in the county.    I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.

6292d9ef630e6d4aba7bd0e0e2d0d97daa	In NYC you, the owner, have to paint every 3 years.  It's the law.    Did the lease you have them sign prohibit them from running a business out of the apartment?  If it did, you can try to evict them on those grounds.    *********    Uh, why the thumbs down? The landlord painting every 3 years in NYC is the LAW and a tenant can actually apply for a rent reduction based on decreased services if you don't do it.  They can also call HPD and have a violation issued.    "Effective August 3,1967, the Housing Maintenance Code of the City of New York was amended to require an owner of a multiple dwelling to paint occupied dwelling units every three years and more often when required by contract or other provision of law."|`|AA11112154	This is just my opinion. If you gave them the place painted and clean, they need to keep it clean. Whatever you do will come out of the security deposit. I personally wouldn't do that because when they leave, you'll have little deposit left to fix things they break (if any). Unless the place got dirty because of licks through the roof or water damage, you shouldn't have to repaint it. It's their responsibility to not have grease and stuff on the walls. Basically they shouldn't have damage that requires more than a sponge and soap to clean. And they should be able to do that themselves.    You can always tell them to pay you for the paint and $20/hr for 3-6 hours for someone to do it for them cheap.    Whatever you do, you shouldn't be pealing paint off. Second, if you rent you should have had the place de-leaded (at least that's how it is in MA). If they find out that it isn't, they can sue you and win!    Good luck.|`|vCePK8gMaa	You have no obligation to paint, tp pay for paint or to allow the tenants to paint.    Tenants generally do a horrible of of painting and end up causing damage by getting paint on the ceilings, woodwork & trim.

Millions of others are with you.    Talk to a bankruptcy lawyer. He/she could explain to you your exact protections afforded from filing bankruptcy. There are a couple of different options you can file.    Again, go talk with a bankruptcy lawyer.    Good luck.

Secondly, as Pakistan is known to train and export terrorism, there would be rigorous checks to ensure your credibility.
4MypYVHYaa	If the bank foreclosed on your house and a sale produce more than the loan you had on the property plus any attorney and foreclosure fees and real estate sales commission then you are entitled to the overage. This is normal and often the case.    Most house that are foreclosed on do not normally exceed the loan amount thus the bank have to take a loss on the property. If the bank has a loss, the IRS has came to the conclusion that someone had a gain. Since you lived in the house prior to the foreclosure the IRS has come to the conclusion that you had the gain.    The lender will send you a 1099 indicating this gain. You will have to pay federal taxes based on this gain.     You should contact a tax consultant upon receipt of this 1099 from your former lender.    I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.

At this point, almost all the time there is going to be a loss for the bank.  They would never take it back for more then you owe.  Plus you have late payments, late fees and lawyer fees AND the amount of the loan.  This is what you owe the bank.    2.  Now the bank is the actual owner of the property.  What ever they sell it for, profit or loss doesn't effect you.

It was their house at that point.    You can bet they sold it after expenses for less than you owed.  Their costs to sell the home were far in excess of $12,000. I think legally they can come after you for the differnece, but that is very unusual.    They sure cannot come after you for your entire loan balance.

qWaYbxcxaa	AIG  is trading just over $1.00 currently.     The company is losing $16.52/ share in earnings. What this means is the company's stock is worthless.     http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=aig    AIG did not file BK, but in effect is DOA. The USG bailed them out but took about 80% controlling interest in AIG.    U.S. to Take Over AIG in $85 Billion Bailout  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12215656...  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/busine...    I have not checked regarding AIG's div, but the gov has been forcing institutions to cut their div down to 1 cent in some cases.    As for an investment, I had red flagged AIG last year and wrote about that I had various trading positions (mostly net short), and said to avoid AIG then. (add me to see those posts). My view on AIG has not changed.     http://quicktake.morningstar.com/StockNe...|`|dC6A5R5Saa	I think AIG is kind of dead and forgotten.  It's not even listed in the S&P 500 index any more.  The stock trades for about $1 and it's still on a down-trend.    If you want a good dividend, then I think Microchip Technologies (MCHP) is the best.  The tech stocks are leading the way and this offers a 6.73% yield.  This company loves pampering its investors by raising the dividend each year:  http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg...    The stock is in a $16-$20 trading range, but more likely to go up as the NASDAQ 100 index rises.|`|hvcjyEmDaa	Part of the Federal bail out of AIG required them to stop paying dividends on common shares. AIG did not go bankrupt, as you stated ( it should have- but that is why the federal government bailed them out. They were deemed too big to fail.)    I think you could find a better investment. The Government now owns 80% of AIG, all those investors now own 20%. Furthermore, the government has warrants on AIG. You, as a little investor, would be last in line to get paid. There are plenty of articles about AIG. Go to www.seekingalpha.com or yahoo finance and read up on AIG. If, after you find out more about them, you want to take a gamble, do it with money you can afford to lose. It will take years for AIG to recover ( if ever) but that doesn't mean you can't make some $$ trading it.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	They are insolvent -- that means that they are functionally bankrupt.  Common equity holders (US:AIG) are unlikely to receive anything whenever the profitable bits are sold off.    Common stock holders are last in line during liquidation and reorganization.

PxoKseAiaa	The one answer is incorrect saying that since you chose to *quit* you don't owe anything. LOL  If only it were that easy!  You will owe for the amount of time you spent in the rental, and since you didn't give a proper 30 day notice, you may be charged another 30 days or months rent. Now, this is all in theory, as it might be more work than it's worth to take you to court to get this amount, but be prepared for it.  Like another poster said, maybe talk to management about what it would take to pay them off and be done with things.    Just because you choose to quit doesn't mean you don't have to pay.  If you were on a lease, you would have been sued for the remainder of the lease!|`|23SkYEw5aa	yes, you would still owe for the balance of Feb AND!!!!!! you would owe for march since you didn't give at least 30 days notice.  If your lease states you have to give 60 days, you would also owe for April.|`|AA11215123	Yes. The landlord could simply forget it or sue you for the full amount and nail your butt and damage your credit.    They can't raise the rent if you are on a lease, but if you are on m2m you should have moved out immediately.    Go to the landlord and come to a written agreement to avoid court. A private agreement won't enter your credit record if you honor it.|`|eAWCr04Zaa	You owe for the time you lived there. You also need to check your lease agreement because if you took advantage of any "move in specials" or signed the lease for a set amount of time you may be on the hook for some money.     With move in specials you usually have to pay back all, or a portion, of the special. So if you got in for 2 months free and you've only lived there 5 months - but you signed a 1 year lease, they may demand you pay those 2 free months back to them since you didn't live up to the lease agreement.    Some companies lease agreements say you have to cover your rent for 30 or 90 days if you leave short of the lease. So you need to pull that out and look for any fees or penalties.|`|yHl7RIuOaa	No you do not have to pay if you are leaving.  That notice is asking you to do one or the other.  Pay or quit your lease.    But be informed here that you do not have to leave by day 3, or pay.  An eviction has to be done by a court. If you fail to abide by "Notice to Quit" they will then go to court and ask the to court evict you. It will be important you show up for court date because it will buy you time.    If you show up in court you will likely get another 30-60 days to move out.

kZRTekoJaa	I quit working when my son was 9 months old and have been trying to find a work at home job ever since. :)  I have actually found a lot of paid survey sites that are legitimate and do pay, however it takes a lot of time and the pay is very very small.  I also know from experience that the HUD refund processors/third party tracers is a legitimate job. you can even go to the HUD website and see for yourself that it is legitimate. the biggest downside, however is that most people will verify your legitimacy before sending you money and when they go to verify they will find out they can get their refund for free with no outside help. but there is potential.  between the scams and the people who aren't actually willing to do any work and then will say a company is a scam, it is hard to know which companies are legitimate and you can only trust a stranger's opinion for so much. i would recommend trying out GDI's work at home program. it's affiliate marketing. there is a 7 day free trial, so you can see for yourself the earning potential. After that it only costs $10 a month. if you're serious about working from home, then it's definitely worth a risk free try to make sure you're not passing up a good earning opportunity. and you can learn more about it here: http://website.ws/rbuckley85|`|fKqH9k6Yaa	"If a company requires initial payment from you in order to work for them, they are not legitimate."

It doesn't make sense that you would have to pay in if they were taking out enough.  Since you claimed 0, you should at least have broken even, I would think.  Unless you had some other form of income which you didn't pay taxes on and that offset any "extra" amount you paid in by claiming 0.    My husband, before we were married, filed single after claiming 0 on his W4 and he always got a refund of at least a few hundred dollars.|`|BqXSymxjaa	It depends on how much money you made and where you fall in the tax bracket.

The tables are the minimum they will withhold.  My suggestion would be to take and additonal $10/week out in Federal tax.  Or per pay period.  You can request this on the W4 you fill out for your employer each year.  You cannot do anything for the current year, as the employer only withheld what you requested.  You can check to be sure the employer is using updated tables but bottom line is you should have checked your pay stubs to be sure you were withholding enough.  The IRS will  be of no help here, they will put the blame back on you.|`|EMk4iBEOaa	It could be a factor of your employer didn't withhold enough federal taxes on you which is a common thing. Also did you have any other income like dividends on stocks or interest on bank accounts because all that counts as income that has to be taxed... take it to a tax office like H&R Block or Jackson Hewit and they will explain it for you and the info is free...

mcgONGBVaa	bill gates started from home|`|Vq8Szjs9aa	This is an easy one to answer.    It all depends on how you will market and sell your products.  If you intend to sell your products primarily through walk-in traffic (foot traffic),then you almost certainly need some type of retail space.  Unfortunately, this option can be quite expensive.    If you will market/sell your products via ecommerce or through 3rd party retailers/distributors, then either option works.  However, leasing office space too can become quite expensive before you know if you have a viable business.  Can you float your business operating expenses until you become viable?  Let's say, for 12 months without any income?  If you have no receivables or expectations of sales in the short term, than you would be better served using your residence as your "office" and storing your product in climate controlled self storage.  You could probably do this for $50-$75 per month or less.  This will be considerably less expensive than renting office space.        As far as a professional image for your business, if most of your correspondence is via email/telephone, you could simply sign up for one of the hundred's of virtual office providers fairly cheaply.  There are several, but the best I have found is www.phone.com.  The base package is something like $10/mo for an 800 number, 300 inbound minutes and 10 extensions.  Plus, they can record a professional greeting for you at your discretion.    Lastly, if you're outsourcing production of your products, you should consider forming your business with liability protection in mind.  What if your source goofs (or is just plain ignorant) and your candles are toxic?  I almost always recommend forming as an LLC for pass-through income status.    Whoever told you that you should start off in an office because you are intending to end up there has an interesting perspective.  I wonder if they have ocean front property in Colorado for sale?  The reality is most small business failures occur as a result of funding (or lack thereof).  Why put yourself at a disadvantage right from the get go if you don't have to.  When you're ready to upgrade (ie....office/retail space), you will be able to do so irrespective of your paltry beginnings.    Good luck!|`|djs0cPVraa	Home vs office both have pros and cons.  Many service professionals actually try part time offices.  Regis and other companies allow you to have a office address and you get X number of days in the office and can hold client meetings, have phones answered, use the printing facilities, etc....which is a great option above the work only from home model without taking on the expense or risk of a long term full time office lease.  However, your biz is more manufacturing and assembling products, storing stock, etc which would mean you need dedicated full time space.  The other issue is you are making "soy candles" and this sounds like it could have a strong odor....which may cause more issues by keeping this at home or even cause a lasting odor in the home if you tried to sell it (have you ever looked at a house where the previous owner cooked lots of spice food or strong odor food....that almost never leaves the house) or just might make it harder to stay in the home.   If you have a well vented garage or storage space it might be good.  Before you start any business you will want to work with a good CPA locally so they can walk you through the business setup process to make sure you take full tax advantage of your setup and structure....but i think the bigger issue will be 1- can you afford rental expense at this time of the business and 2- how much odor will your production cause   and are more significant then any zonning or home office tax deductions.|`|nmRZqyeoaa	Bar none, running it from your home is almost always cheaper than from a space you have to rent.  Most of the time the zoning rules have to do with the amount of traffic coming in and out of the residence, so if you tend to do more sales activity at your customers location instead of in your home, you may be able to get around the stipulations.    If you need to start holding more stock of items, slowly work up to using a climate controlled storage place (like public storage) as a mini-warehouse and build from there.  Ideally, the only reason I could see you having to use an office is if you need to have the appearance of a stronger company for large customers.
fR2Geezcaa	In the Northeast region of the US, approx 30k-35k. After 5+ yrs approx 40k-45k.     It depends on where you live. I had the same position as a relative of mine had in the south and I made 20k more a year than they did. They had about 15 yrs more experience and worked for a larger company than I did too. Pay greatly varies from region to region. Not to mention how successful is the company?. Smaller profit = smaller pay.|`|suWnr83laa	Would help if you let us know what part of the country you are in.

pDrkcc6taa	Do you have your pay stubs?  You can file with those, call the IRS 1-800-829-1040 and tell them what happened.  They have a form to file and or they will try to contact the employer for you.  You can only do with what you have, but the IRS will walk you through the process.  The best time is to call in the EARLY morning as you will get thru the easiest without being on hold forever.  You could try their website too.
QLopvWKDaa	Since you do not have a strong resume, a great letter of recommendation will dedefinitely give you the edge. They will bring attention to what strong points you may have not evident in your resume.    The employer maty decide to "give you a chance" based on the recommendation.  Good Luck!|`|fR2Geezcaa	They are not essential but do help, especially if you don't have a solid work history. They can prove that you are a valued employee and did not leave your previous employer due to any fault of your own.    I would try to get one from your last employer. They help when you are called in to for an interview and asked "why did you leave your last employer". You will be able prove that you were let go due to "down-sizing" for example and that you would have stayed there (just like you will stay at the job your interviewing for).|`|cC568h4xaa	I hire people.

Letters of recommendation will really just help if they are trying to decide between 2 people that seem equally qualified.  They won't hire you just because you have a good recommendation letter if your resume and experience aren't up to par.|`|UnzEIbxgaa	I don't think they play a huge part in the hiring process. I had a former employer give me a "Rave" recommendation over the phone. The Hr manager even commented that she had to cut him off, because he was going on and on about how wonderful I was....and I still didn't get the job.  But, she did call me 2 weeks later with another position offer.     They really just want to get an idea as to what type of employee you were. Were you absent a lot? Did you have disciplinary issues? Things along those lines.  The recommendations are helpful, but they won't necessarily land you the job.|`|AA12179926	If you are young and just building your resume, of course you want as many letters of recommendations as possible.  As you build your Professional life you will not need them as much.  as time goes on, you need to check dates and relevance of why you still have letters of recommendations.  this goes for the same with the jobs posted on your resume, check date and relevance.  If it's over 10 years old and has nothing to do with the current job you are applying for, you can remove it.

If you were not in school at all the only way they can claim you is if you had gross income less than $3500 and you did not provide over 1/2 your own support.  Support includes such things as the home you live in, the food, utilities and all the items that are paid for your support.      Now if your parent have the right to claim you and you earn under $5450 all from wages shown on a W-2 then you would receive a refund of all the federal income tax you had withheld.

I did get in a huge fight with my parents over this at age 18.  I was paying rent, all of my own bills and even car.  They insisted on claiming me, although they did not have a right to at this point.  If they were paying for me, then yes they would have a right to.  You want to work this out with your parents so you don't get in trouble for being claimed by both.
iZrMceyxaa	Enterprise information is an asset that has to be protected by the organization. This can be done using simple document retention and control systems that manage all kinds of documents in the organization. The files that need to be protected and controlled are first identified based on their attributes. They are then moved to appropriate storages according to the life expectancy of that data. Document control is primary for governance, risk and compliance solutions.
nmRZqyeoaa	Go to a local med supply retailer or look one up online and write down some brand names.  Contact the brand, who makes it and ask them who their distributors are.  Contact distributors and ask them what they need to sell to you (DBA, state sales tax permit, etc...) and get those things.  Once you have that account with them, then your set to do retail.
lO2Nvj81aa	The MAXIMUM amount you could have received, in your situation, was $1800 ($1200 for you and your wife, $300 for each dependant).      The MINIMUM amount you could have received, in your situation, was $1200 ($600 for you and your wife, $300 for each dependant).    You probably didn't earn enough to qualify for the full $1200 and instead only got $600 for you and your wife, then $300 for each dependant, making your rebate amount $1200 total.      That means you probably do not qualify for a recovery rebate.|`|SEwqwjPkaa	Regardless of what you got or didn't get...you only need to enter the total amount of the stimulus rebate you received in 2k8.  I saw nothing on the form which required me to enter what I didn't get.  It only prompts for the amount YOU RECEIVED.  That said, I would imagine you will be entering 1200.  Other than that I'm not sure what you're asking.    Hope this helped!    Peace!  The Reverend|`|znr8SBiWaa	If you figure it wrong, the IRS will recalculate it for you.    $1800 was the MAX that you could have gotten, but many people got less.  For example, $1200 was the max that we could have gotten with it (married filed jointly, with 1 child), but because of our income level, we only qualified for $900.    Just because you didn't get the maximum amount does not mean you can claim the Rebate Recovery Credit.    The delays were because of people who did not properly claim it.  And the delays did not just happen to people who tried to get it back when they shouldn't have.    If you are owed money for the RRC, and did not put that on your return, then the IRS will delay the refund by about a week, and give you more money.  Crazy, I know, but they did it to me!  Seems that since I got a divorce last year, I should have only claimed 1/2 the credit we got when filing ($450), which means I got an extra $150 on my form.    Not complaining LOL When the IRS says there was a mistake that gets you more money, you're happy!    Anyway, if you file electronically, the provider will ask you how much you got.  The software calculates whether you got as much as you should, or if you didn't get enough.  If you got the right amount, you'll either have $0 or nothing at all on line 70.  If you got too much (not likely, but could happen), you get to keep it.  You don't have to pay it back.  Again, you'll have $0 or nothing at all on line 70.  If you didn't get enough, the software will put the difference on line 70.    If it's correct, the IRS should process your return on time, but it may be delayed by up to a week.
nmRZqyeoaa	Shouldn't be any reason that you could not.  Just have to work a little harder to find a market for people that only want their house cleaned on the weekends.  Talk to some local realtors and see if they know of anyone that rents out their place on weekends, such as a vacation property, and you might be able to organize to get a few accounts for Sunday cleanups after people have left for the weekend.  Alternately, you could offer Friday night pre-cleans of rental property as well, since people that don't rent their place but go there on weekends would want a clean place when they arrive.  This might be a good start.  I, for example, am not very comfy with a person being in my house when I am not.  Not out of distrust, but it just irks me, so even though I also work 5 days a week, I'd be the type that would prefer my cleaner to come on a weekend when I am around.|`|x3fQP9viaa	that's the pleasure of your own business, you decide.|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Sure, why not?

vCePK8gMaa	How the yard maintenance is handled will depend on the landlord and the lease.     I handle all yard maintenance for my rentals. I prefer to do it because then I can see if there are any issues or damages as they happen and keep everything uniform.

The tenants do the yard maintenance on their half, which is determined by the location of the shared wall.    I allow them to do whatever they want in back, and on the sides, but not the front.   I paid for the landscaping in front and do not allow them to remove anything, or plant anything major (like a tree) to keep the fron looking uniform.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	I own a couple duplexes and I take care of the maintenance.

However, all deposits of cash are recorded and most likely will be reported to the IRS at some point.  Be sure you can document the source.  You are more likely to have the cash ceased by the government because they think you are laundering illegal money than for collection of someone elses debt (banks are more likely to do that).
AA12178731	Anti-money laundering (AML) is a term mainly used in the financial and legal industries to describe the legal controls that require financial institutions and other regulated entities to prevent or report money laundering activities. Anti-money laundering guidelines came into prominence globally after the September 11, 2001 attacks and the subsequent enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act.    Today, most financial institutions globally, and many non-financial institutions, are required to identify and report transactions of a suspicious nature to the financial intelligence unit in the respective country.     For example, a bank must perform due diligence by ascertaining a customer's identity and monitor transactions for suspicious activity. To do this, many financial institutions utilize the services of special software, and use the services of companies such as WorldCompliance to gather information about high risk individuals and organizations.United States federal law related to money laundering is implemented under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 as amended by anti-money laundering acts up to the present. Many people have confused Anti-Money Laundering (AML) with Anti-Terrorist Financing (ATF). Under the Bank Secrecy Act of USA, Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing are classified into two different categories when financial institutions file Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) which is a US government agency. To effectively implement AML and ATF measures, The US government encourages financial institutions to work together for AML and ATF purposes in accordance with Section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act. However, since financial institutions are required by law to protect the privacy of their clients, section 314(b) cooperation has not been generally adopted by financial institutions. To overcome this obstacle, the United Crimes Elimination Network (UCEN) has been established by AML and ATF professionals to achieve this global cooperation goal in compliance with the privacy laws of most countries.    Money laundering involves three independent and often simultaneous steps :    1.Placement - Physically placing bulk cash proceeds.     2.Layering - Separating the proceeds of criminal activity from their origins through layers of complex financial transactions.     3.Integration - Providing an apparently legitimate explanation for the illicit proceeds.    The financial services industry has become increasingly vocal about the rising costs of anti-money laundering regulation, and the limited benefits that appears to bring. As one commentator expresses the issue:     It seems that the bigger the figure for money laundering the more likely it is to be quoted. Indeed, there is even a tendency to 'talk up' the figures as smaller estimates would not only invalidate the logic of the approach [of strict anti-money laundering regulation] but would possibly deter the levels of investment necessary for its operational impact. Without facts, legislation has been driven on rhetoric, driving by ill-guided activism responding to the need to be "see to be doing something" rather than by an objective understanding of its impace on pedicate crime. The social panic approach is justified by the language used - we talk of the battle against terrorism or the war on drugs..

Be very afraid.     First of all, there are strict rules covering the work of independent contractors. Many companies have long ignored them, in order to operate without paying employee taxes, Social Security, and unemployment insurance tax.     If you are required to work there, to work regular hours, to be supervised by someone who is in your presence, or to use equipment they own, they are probably violating the law. They are misclassifying workers.     If you work under this agreement, you will not have violated any laws. Instead, you'll get burned--you'll pay higher, self-employment taxes, and, as you've figured out, you can forget about health insurance. You can't afford it, quite possibly, and no, they are probably not going to pay it.

Macy's, like it's competitors, has made some pretty significant cuts.  I'd suggest you look into the grocery industry which is fairly recession resistant.  Your cashier experience will be a plus.  I definitely agree with the last responder - by all means, apply at Macy's.  Understand though that with the cuts, Macy's will try to fill any and all positions from within.

Without the actual card in hand, not only would you have pass a mod-10 check for a card (this can be easily done - just google mod-10 and you will understand); but you would also have to correctly guess what the expiry date on this card would be, plus you would have to guess the three-digit CVV2 number on the back of the card (usually beside the signature strip and on the front for American Express)    The CVV2 number is a random number that cannot be derived from the number on the front of the card, is not contained on the magnetic strip data, and is used for telephone or online purchases to ensure that the person has the "card in hand".    Having said all that, if you are/were able to make a purchase with a number that you just made up -- good for you, it's really the merchant's fault for not ensuring they used all the fraud protection methods I have described above.    As far as getting in trouble, unless you had something delivered to your house or there was some way of identifying you as the person who committed the fraud, you're home free.
i5ZNMHR9aa	If you have a bad credit history still the loan market place is full of lenders who are ever willing to offer you a fresh loan. But you should be meeting some conditions laid down by the lenders. Loans for bad credit people are in fact easier to get then they were ever before, thanks mainly to cut-throat competition amongst the lenders. Lenders are giving loans to the bad credit people who have late payments, payment defaults, arrears, county court judgments or any credit problems. These loans are available for any purpose like home improvements, purchasing a new or used car of your choice, for wedding and holiday tour, debt consolidation or for paying childs tuition fees.     http://loan--house.blogspot.com/2008/03/...    Every lender in approving loans surely likes to see if the bad credit borrower has sufficient capacity to repay the loan in timely manner. If the borrower earns well, has regular bank balance, has been an employee for some years and has a convincing loan repayment plan in place, then the lenders do not usually hesitate much. So ensure that you have adequate repaying capacity before applying for a loan. Also, you should first check your credit report for any errors. If your credit score is too low then you would be charged a very high rate of interest. So it is advisable to first pay off some easy debts to improved credit score and then you should apply for loan at better rates.    http://loan-house.we.bs/badcreditloans.h...|`|AA11173563	NEED no you don't NEED you want and with bad credit would you lend you money?

snh9wzpnaa	No, the IRS is still doing DD dumps and check issuing only Fridays.  They add a couple of days to hedge their bets on DD dumps because most banks want to use your money interest free for a couple of days before they will admit having it, so the IRS is telling you to add 2 business days, making it the next Tuesday.|`|Ms4yyAL1aa	That is a great question! Last year I did direct deposit w/ Jackson Hewitt and got my refund in like a week.....what is the delay this year? My date says the same thing, but if you call the IRS, they will tell you it allotts time for the banks to get that amount credited to your account. I think the direct deposit wait times are ridiculous this year!  When you filed, your expected refund date was probably Feb 13th huh!|`|71GQYa30aa	mine says dd on 1/30 well its 2/3 and it isnt here my date has not changed on wheres my refund stills says 1/30 so does phone line i dont know where mine is starting to panic|`|Ur09nnclaa	You should call.

xszqbAFXaa	Just go to the interview dressed business like, and have a positive attitude. Let them know you are eager to work for the company, and how much you would appreciate the oppritunity.|`|07xcF1OGaa	Preparation:    Learn about the organization.   Have a specific job or jobs in mind.   Review your qualifications for the job.   Be ready to briefly describe your experience, showing how it relates it the job.   Be ready to answer broad questions, such as "Why should I hire you?" "Why do you want this job?" "What are your strengths and weaknesses?"   Practice an interview with a friend or relative.       Personal appearance:    Be well groomed.   Dress appropriately.   Do not chew gum or smoke.       The interview:    Be early.   Learn the name of your interviewer and greet him or her with a firm handshake.   Use good manners with everyone you meet.   Relax and answer each question concisely.   Use proper Englishavoid slang.   Be cooperative and enthusiastic.   Use body language to show interestuse eye contact and dont slouch.   Ask questions about the position and the organization, but avoid questions whose answers can easily be found on the company Web site.   Also avoid asking questions about salary and benefits unless a job offer is made.   Thank the interviewer when you leave and shake hands.   Send a short thank you note.       Information to bring to an interview:    Social Security card.   Government-issued identification (drivers license).   Resume or application. Although not all employers require a resume, you should be able to furnish the interviewer information about your education, training, and previous employment.   References. Employers typically require three references. Get permission before using anyone as a reference. Make sure that they will give you a good reference. Try to avoid using relatives as references.   Transcripts. Employers may require an official copy of transcripts to verify grades, coursework, dates of attendance, and highest grade completed or degree awarded.     Maybe just try google,   (Tips for an interview) ect.|`|5rQWrpyGaa	Dress professionally!!! I have seen many people blow interviews because they come dressed inappropriately.  Other than that...research the company and know their history and what they do.  It really impresses employers if you already know about the company.  Be prepared with answers for questions like "Why do you want this job?" "Why do you think you're a good candidate?", etc.  And think ahead of time of some questions that you can ask them.  Employers like it if you have questions for them; it shows you're really interested.  Have some questions about the actual functions of the job, and some about the company and environment.|`|fFObxgxuaa	"nail" the interviewer!!...duh|`|AA11880595	Well be on time, speak clearly don't talk down on past employers when they ask if you have any questions, ask a few questions ask them to describe the perfect candidate for the position and always ask when they will be making a decision.

3CWoQ10kaa	interviewing is an art. i have never not gotten a job that i had the opportunity to interview for. you have to of course dress nice. stand to shake hands. be prepared with pen information on the job and the company like the mission statement. try to use information from the mission statement in the answers to the questions they ask you. seem confident. not desperate for the job like you have other options. try to find a way to connect to the interviewer, something in common. don't bring ur phone in so it cant go off on accident. make sure your keys are put away so they don't jingle. don't fidget, be composed. look them in the eye. make sure you eat a good breakfast. there are a million little tricks that don't seem like much but make the world of difference.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Do your research. Read all you can about the company and find something relevant to say at the interview.

AA10255553	US Federal law requires them to pay over time of one and half times your hourly rate if you go over 40 hours in any 7 day pay period.
kGJND4lYaa	No.    Say your paycheck is $1000 gross weekly, $700 net after deductions.    The advance is treated separately, after deductions. If you were advanced $600, you would get a check for 700 - 600 = $100.    Only if the employer was foolish enough to advance you more than the net amount would you owe them money.
SdTQVUaKaa	mm... this is a big issue with Federal as well, although they aren't issuing IOU's they are pushing us, sometimes as far out as a month to get our money back, with no answer .. ok, straight answer, as to why.

Both are Federal agencies.|`|aCDWwsisaa	It depends how long it is until you retire....CD's typically pay a very low guaranteed return...if you put $10,000 in a Credit Union CD and left it there for 30 years, you'd have about $32,000.  If you put it in "broad market" mutual fund of stocks instead (which I'm guessing you think isn't "safe"), you'll end up with somewhere between $57,000 (if the market sucks for three decades) & $300,000 (if the market outdoes itself for three decades)...the most likely outcome would be about $150,000.    So would you rather have $32,000 or $150,000?  The very most dangerous thing you can do with your IRA is to take no risk at all... your IRA should be with a brokerage, not a bank or credit union...|`|yHl7RIuOaa	No there is essentially no difference.

That is the cleanest way to handle it.  See page 82 of the 1040 Instructions.|`|snh9wzpnaa	Yes.  The deceased should have their last tax return filed.  Chances are you will get a refund anyway so why not.  If she has an executor, then they are supposed to do it.  If not, then anybody who feels like they are responsible enough to should and that person gets or decides on what happens to the refund.

kXF6JBFLaa	You are in a fortunate position to be young and starting to invest while prices are low and bargains abound.    First, eliminate the funds with "income" in their names; this is a code word for "bonds". Right now, at your age, you want to go 100% into stocks.    Of the remaining funds, I would pick 2-4 of them depending on how much you want to manage the size of the companies you invest in (in terms of market capitalization).    I recommend FDIVX to get international exposure. Then choose FUSEX if you want just one, low-cost fund with exposure to the major US market. If you are biased toward large caps, go with FBGRX or FCNTX. You can see from the names which funds are mid and small caps. You might want one large, one mid, and one small, if you enjoy tracking how these things are faring over time.    If it were me, knowing what I know now (and I'm much older than you), I would go 50% into FDIVX and 50% into FUSEX and not have to think about these investments for a long, long time.|`|70115abe3c7ac499dfd7d67758f0196caa	Here's a page for finding a good good mutual fund to invest in:  http://www.best-stock-trading-systems.co...

toiFHC9Faa	Accounting is an information and measurement system that identifies, records, and communicates relevant, reliable, and comparable information about an organization's business activities. (That is the definition from my college introductory accounting book)    This simply means that accounting is keeping up with a company's financial transactions. Accounting answers the question of how much money was exchanged and where it went and for what purpose.|`|iUJWCxYVaa	Dear, look it up.|`|AA12127832	Search Google.

7K3RcnNcaa	If the house sells (which is a big if these days), the purchaser would be buying it subject to your rights as a tenant.    I've been both a landlord and a tenant. The down side for you is the fact that it is a pain to have strangers (potential purchasers) coming through your home.  Provided proper notice is given to you , the landlord is well within his or her rights to do that.    It is also a lot harder to sell a place with tenants in it.  It is illegal in some places for a tenant to lie to a purchaser and invent problems or flaws in the home that do not exist, but they can still discourage buyers by saying things that are true.  "It's a nice place except for the night-shift neighbour's Harley" or "We like it here except for the traffic noise, or whatever".    In my opinion, it was dirty of the landlord to take your money without revealing the intention to sell, but it's legal and there you have it.      This world would be a much better place if we all held ourselves to a higher standard than what we can get away with.    On the other hand, if the place is being sold as a revenue property, it's no skin off your nose if you make out the rent cheque to someone new.|`|AA10228743	OMG that can't be legal!|`|ryfYV3QMaa	I have heard there are scams out there too, people taking money from potential renters that aren't really the owners....especially if the house is vacant....|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Of course it CAN be legal.  Is the lease month to month or 6 months etc.    IF it is an annual lease the new owners, when it sells, will have to abide by that lease regardless.  OR they may choose to buy you out which is also possible.  If they want to buy it for rental property all that will change with you is the name on your rent checks.  But if you have an annual lease REMEMBER the current owners sell the property with least in tact or you can ask for monetary damages to move.  Stuff like but not limited to moving expenses and a $ figure JUST to get you to move though you do  not have too.
WMrNa3Doaa	Any kind of loan that has both of your names on it is considered a "joint" account.    As far as getting a mortgage, if you apply jointly and have no income, they are going to base it on his credit profile. You say you have a bad credit history, but a hight credit score...I am not sure how this is possible, unless the previous bad credit is from many years ago and no longer showing up on your credit profile.    But in any case, as long as he could qualify on his own, I don't think your past credit history should affect it too much.  Seeing as how you are unemployed, you wouldn't be adding anything to the loan anyway, so they would base it entirely on his credit score & DTI/income, etc.... As long as he qualifies,  they would probably still allow you on the loan as the co-signer.|`|kzkrll3Xaa	its a joint account. they probably wouldnt turn it down for your credit rating if his is good.|`|fbqrIdkuaa	The mortgage would be a joint account if you applied for it together and are both on the mortgage as borrowers.  However, just because you are married it does not make it a joint account.  If he applies for the mortgage as the only borrower...it is not a joint account.  And, the credit score that you had posted in the other question is by far high enough to get a quality loan with a great rate.|`|ArtZwIbvaa	Yes.  We were in a similar situation and as a result our house is in my husband's name only.  You MAY still get a mortgage but the likelihood (especially in the current economical climate) is that they would put your interest rate up so high that it would not be worth it.    I've rebuilt my rating by taking on my husband;s name, sitting tight for 3 years then starting again with new bank accout etc and being good this time!  Most places don't ask for your previous name if you've been married more than 3 years.

I can't remember the government agency that investigates these things but the representative of said agency that was interviewed told the reporter that in 30 years his agency had never come across one that worked and he had tested many.  The basic rule of thumb is only put what the vehicle manufacturer recommends into your gas tank.    As for MLM, most programs are scams.

These additives show up on the market every time the gas prices go up by a significant amount. If they were not a scam, then where are they when people have gotten used to paying that price for gas, and demand for economizing decreases?     The only legitimate way to save on fuel is to drive a car with a hybrid engine (gas/electric). This is all we have, until they start putting hydrogen engines into cars, and we can all make our own fuel by cracking water molecules.

JxpT4PlZaa	[Quote]  To overcome the shortcoming of using the balance at the beginning of the year and the balance at the end of the year, some accountants use 13 balances: the balance at the beginning of the year plus the balances at the end of each month.  [/Quote]
f01ff94a2400891b63aaf4d21aa2eff6aa	Professional tax is levied by state governments or local bodies on professions, trades, callings and employment. The power to levy the tax flows from Article 276 of the Constitution that also caps the tax amount.  The professional taxes are charged on the incomes of individuals, profits of business or gains in vocations.

Good luck.|`|OeLQPhaWaa	Go to www.investors.com and use the "Financial Dictionary" to get the definition of different financial terms.    Option = A privilege sold by one party to another that offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security at an agreed upon price during a certain period of time or on a specific date.
CeAA1TjOaa	Hello, just wanted to add that I am having the same error.  I filed my return on 1/23/2009 and it was received and accepted on 1/24/2009.  According to the "Where's my refund" site, I would have had my refund around 2/06/2009, which is very reasonable.  Today is 2/5/2009, and I checked again on the wheres my refund site and found I had the same error as you did, ref 1481.  I changed my name in May of 08 and the first thing I got changed was my SSN.  I was told that the SSA would forward this updated information to the IRS and I would not need to take further action.  But, low and behold, 9 months later I file my taxes and get the 1481 error.  The IRS agent I initially spoke with was somewhat rude in her explanation: There was a problem with our automated system verifying your SSN and name so we now have to wait 6-8 weeks till the system releases your file so we can further process it.  You should have filed a paper return this year, cause now your going to have to wait approximately 2 months for us to get this figured out and your refund to you!"  So, it was my fault that they had 9 months to update their system before I filed my taxes...  I called the SSA and I was given the information in reference to the IRS getting the update on May 20, 2008, so I called back to the IRS and spoke to a very nice rep who informed me that it should not take 6-8 weeks for processing, it will more than likely be handled within the 3 week period they have to normally process e-filed returns.  According to the IRS website concerning e-files, they have up to 10 business days to process the return.      I did get a better explanation of the system and basically, they IRS gets updated information from the SSA and inputs it into our Master File (i.e. your old information is updated with the new name and any other changes to your old information) the IRS should in theory be able to pull up your file with your SSN and DOB which will show them your new information as well as your old.  This is wonderful however they also have separate systems for both e-file and paper returns.  The system in use for the e-file could not have been updated to look for your new name and SSN versus what they had on file last year, so if they don't update that computer, when you file, it will reject your return on the 1481 basis.  It is totally unfair and basically nothing that you can do about it, because you would have to prove several things.  One major thing you would have to prove is that they received your information from the SSA in time to change it properly in both systems, or that the SSA did this intentionally to harm you in some way.  It really does boil down to what the gentleman just replied, the right hand ( the IRS agents) not telling the left hand (the computers) what its doing.      Maybe there are more of us that received that 1481 code and can band together and write a complaint that might force the IRS to ensure that they update all aspects of their processing center to allow for more fluid movement of the returns, but I think we would have more luck getting milk from a brick.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Things happen.  In this case the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing.  There is a big crackdown on tax fraud.  You are just unlucky to get caught in the middle.  Suffer this year.  Hopefully, next year you will not have to go through the same thing.
t2pMn6Mtaa	Why not check the price of similar stores that may be for sale? This will give you some indication of the cost. Normally, when somebody wishes to go into business they have two choices. Start off on their own, or buy an existing business. Usually it is cheaper to start one on you own because the existing business that is for sale will include an amount for 'goodwill'. Goodwill being the business' reputation and customer base.
dC6A5R5Saa	Short selling is not new.  People were doing that during the early 1930's during the Great Depression.    Warren Buffet wouldn't care about short selling.  He's more an investor than a trader.  Warren analysis businesses more than share prices and buys solid companies that are undervalued.    After the sell off, when the market crashed in October 2008, I read on the bloomberg website that Warren bought into General Electric and Goldman Sachs.    With so many undervalued companies such as General Electric and Microsoft, short selling is financial suicide at the moment.    Years ago, when I first short sold a down trending market, I got more excited and short sold more as the down trend continued.  As it turned out my losses when the market rebounded sweeped away my early gains.  I learned the hard way many times that the market is for making money, not your ego.     The sort of people who are short selling now are novice traders who only look at charts at the markets bottom or near bottom and don't also analyze the underlying businesses.       A girl on Yahoo answers asked if Google would be good stock to short sell.  Google like other tech stocks is now on an up-trend.    Save it for the next bust.  I think the next bull market boom/bust will be bigger than the last, so it's well worth the wait in years to come.|`|IqeyFh4Qaa	Warren Buffet does not short.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Buffett is a long term value investor. I'd stay away from short selling.

You will have to send a letter to each agency that is reporting the incorrect information.      It is important to read and follow their instructions.  Doing so gives you the best chance of having the items removed or corrected the first time around.|`|JUeQIz02aa	Hi,    Actually, you can go deeper into your credit history with an SAR (Subject Access Request)..it costs 10 but, you will get far more information than a standard 2 request.

3HSNFDaJaa	hNot enough info, are you single/couple, kids/no kids, age?    Child Tax Credit is for people who are responsible for at least one child or qualifying young person. Child Tax Credit is paid direct to the person who is mainly responsible for caring for the child or children. If you are a lone parent you will receive the payment. Child Tax Credit can be paid to workers who continue to pay UK National Insurance Contributions when posted from the UK to work in another country in the European Economic Area.     Working Tax Credit is for people who are employed or self-employed (either on their own or in a partnership), who   usually work 16 hours or more a week   are paid for that work, and   expect to work for at least 4 weeks     and who are     aged 16 or over and responsible for at least one child, or   aged 16 or over and disabled, or   aged 25 or over and usually work at least 30 hours a week     Working Tax Credit is paid to the person who is working 16 hours or more a week. Couples, if both of you are working 16 hours or more a week, must choose which one of you will receive it. You cannot receive Working Tax Credit if you are not working.|`|ZYouNFQbaa	Depends on your situation to be honest with you so need more information.    If you are claiming as a single person then it is if you work 16 hour OR MORE a week

Other banks have insurances then they will pay you back your money, or for making it safe just withdraw it and transfer to other banks

After credit repair you can get the loan with minimal interest rate.|`|k2EtMbamaa	That is a pretty low credit score.  Probably the best place to go will be http://usedautoloan.com  If you have the income to back it up you should be ok.  You should be under $400 there.|`|qR3MYSOIaa	That's a pretty low score, you're looking at a second chance credit loan at the interest rates can be 20-26%  That would make your payment more than $400 and for a LONG time...closer to $600/month.      This sounds like a new car, find the same car used (say 2 years old -- still in great condition by that point but someone else paid for the massive depreciation) & you'll save thousands of dollars.  Make the payment for 1 year, and refinance through a bank for a much lower rate.    Or do the really smart thing, buy a used car with your $2500 and have no payment at all.|`|sZiRxE8oaa	It might really save you some money to just get an auto loan price online to verify what the going rates are.

oFiGyMWraa	This is quite normal. Sometimes leases are granted for many years and both the landlord and the leaseholder change, sometimes several times.     The new landlord will be bound by any existing lease, so if you have another 2 years that will be protected. However, the new landlord may have different plans for the property. He may not be willing to renew your lease, and he may even increase any rent you have to pay - if the lease allows for that.    The amount of protection you have is determined by the original lease. If you are worried you should check the lease, possibly with a solicitor. There may be terms that give you the first option to buy if the freehold is for sale, or give you a say on who it is sold to, or guarantee you renewal if you want etc.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	Ask the landlord and the businessman - cant believe that you didn't do this at the outset|`|RhI0ndT2aa	Your lease would still be valid, but you would have a new landlord.  The sale of the premises, if it goes ahead, will reflect that there is an exisiting lease in place, and the terms of that lease will be transferred on.  You will have a copy of your lease, and ask the solicitor who acted for you initially to explain if any changes can be made to your terms whilst you are in occupation.
RNqRnG86aa	1960  ATM predecessor installed  In 1960 New York's First National City Bank (now CitiBank) installed a Bankograph in several branch lobbies. The concept of this machine was for customers to pay utility bills and get a receipt without a teller.    1967  First Cash Dispenser installation  In 1967 a Barclays Bank branch near London debuted the first cash dispenser, made by De La Rue Instruments. It used paper vouchers bought from tellers in advance.    1971  First true bank ATMs  In 1971 Docutel introduced its Total Teller, the first true full-function bank ATM. About the same time, Diebold installed its first TABS machine at a bank branch in the U.S., and Fujitsu installed one in Japan.

e7e1924d8971698b40672960f27475f5aa	You have one major advantage: you understand technology and can "speak the language." That is huge. You also have another advantage: many effective recruiters these days heavily leverage technology (such as advanced Google searches and web-based sourcing), and presumably you'll have an edge there.    The potential drawbacks, which may or may not apply... recruiting is actually a very advanced form of sales. Many IT people are not fond of (or very good at) sales -- for example, many are quite introverted. Also, many IT people are "risk averse," and many recruiters are paid 100% on commission. But these are generalizations, and may not apply to you. If you like interacting and influencing people, and the idea of getting paid as much or as little as your results dictate, this could be a great career move for you. Good luck!
