tDZMJue9aa	nope anyone with any common sense or perhaps a family member who serves could have told you this, all during the elections actually since sometime last july my husband has been planning on deploying and not once did that get halted or put on hold...and its still on in a few weeks it was just one more promise of obamas to get elected and i dont know where the troops are that they show that just want to go home and blahblah that cry ...cause we have never met a single one ...the military is their job their life they signed|`|JhD0X6PLaa	hmmm. to be honest i'm still upset that your boy Dubya got us into Iraq in the first place.|`|Q9W7p6Kzaa	No they aren't.

I'm upset that so many Republicans are so talented at causing war and then failing to show up for them. Iraq is 7 yrs. old now, and whatever time table bush was babbling about is clearly forgotten. I would guess that the 4,000 dead are a little upset that they died in an oil war.|`|3DOQG6hEaa	Nah, he's going to get us out of Iraq ASAP... I like that you say "Anti-War Lefties" like it's a bad thing to be anti-war... guess you're pro-death eh? But no, we'll be leaving soon, don't worry, the illegal and costly war will be over very soon, and no more Americans will die, I'm sure much to your sadness.|`|P7L4Vd3Paa	The first person who responded is probably pro abortion - same as pro death.

3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	There is no way to tell.    60% of all jobs are reserved to be assigned during basic training.    When you enlist under an open area contract.    During the 2nd week at Basic, you talk to the job councilors.    They will give you a list of the General area jobs that your General score qualified you for.    That have a Tech School class slot open, within two weeks of your Basic Training graduation date.    You will list your top 5 preferences in order from the list given to you.    Most people get thier 1st preference.    So it all depends on which AFSC's will have a open slot, right after you graduate Basic.    Tech Schools do not start class's every week, some only have two class's each year.    Do not believe the myths about people being forced to be security forces.    They were assigned security forces, because they choose security forces as one of thier 5 chooses.    If you do not list SF, you will not be assigned SF.|`|QusnnfZZaa	It's always touchy with going in open general.

ZzHE0lvtaa	That worked too well and made too much sense for the Dems, they always have to take the long, expensive route first, then when all else fails still won't use common sense.|`|K8R4fCsZaa	the thing i fear happening is we bail everyone out and they still go under everyone still looses their jobs and the government cant afford welfare from bailing everyone out and 90% of us starve while the depression hits for an extended time since we made it worse!    but none of this will happen all hard times in America are off set by wars and I'm sure a big one will be triggered somewhere and we have equity in war still so we will be ok as long as WW3 hits soon  but maybe I'm an optimist.|`|pM81f5tnaa	Isn't that what Hoover tried?|`|lklwmGh6aa	I just don't think that the ideology works, even Bush  1 bailed out the Savings and Loan industry.

4efdc5368b23398e691a290a96c0937baa	As retired American Navy Officer I worked with a lot of Brits.  They are tough as nails. defiantly much more professional that the French, or Dutch.  I think Brit ton would do a great job holding their own against Almost any country. They proved that during WW2 They are differently the strongest Force in Europe.|`|olahi6esaa	The only country with an armed forces more advanced than the UK is the USA. Probably lose to China as well in a war of attrition. Anyone who says Israel is having a laugh. As for the Falklands war, that was twenty years ago, 8,000 miles from Britain, and we still won.|`|o2c01JsUaa	To hear the brit tell it,they won the war in europe and the war in the pacific all by themselves So if talking a line of B/s wins wars i would say none|`|2VbgWMzmaa	usa, russia, india, iran, china, north korea|`|LBHQkBnkaa	The question isn't relevant. UK will never go to war without support anymore. We are in a miltary alliance with Nato and therefore won't be going to war with them. We have the fourth largest Navy despite all the cuts. We have good relation with most of our common wealth partners so we won't be going to war with them.    As for the idiot who thinks we nearly lost the Falklands war, which Falklands war was that? The one in his small brain?    Just to recap for the hard of thinking. The only way we would have lost the war is if the Argentinians sunk a carrier. They never came close. We could have lost the war at sea but we didn't.     The UK mobilised a force in very short order and sent it to the Falklands where it was outnumbered, had very little air support and lost all but one its heavy lift choppers when a cargo ship was sunk.     The lack of choppers forced the troops to march 80 miles across boggy terrain where it carried out deliberate attacks against an enemy dug in on hilltops.    600 paras forced 2000 argentine marines to surrender at Goose Green and 3 Commando Brigade took hilltop positions at Two Sisters. During this process there was one civilian casualty (notice I called it civilian casualty not collateral damage).     The Royal Navy Harriers smashed the better equipped Argentinian air force, HMS Conqueror sunk the Argentinian Navy's flagship. The massive defeat that we inflicted on the Argentinians Armed forces caused the collapse of the Junta and returned Argentina to democracy.    Sounds like a close run thing to me. I'm assuming that history boy is a yank and I'd advise him to get himself a book and do some research.|`|zVGhHomRaa	They lost to militia back when the U.S was still part of their empire.|`|Uaci5YXWaa	They almost lost to Argentina over the Falklands in 1982.  Think about that.  The question is which countries could they win a war with - Wales maybe?|`|ynlft41Uaa	Algeria and Turkey.|`|DRGchuRGaa	we always fight well above our wieght... but it depends... in a high tech war.. we'd do ok against most.... its the low tech wars we struggle with.... like argentina... where we spent more on fuel getting there, than we used to roll them out of thier trenches...    argentina wasnt a war... it was a stroll.... a couple of days out.. on a jolly....|`|IXSGaD5aaa	USA, Russia, China and India. If it was a nuclear war we would all lose.|`|a4f625e9943640ad9aec7382d7bcfe89aa	Depends what kind of war .There are plenty of country's with large forces with could likely beat the UK .If it became an all out fight for survival then apart from their fellow superpowers USA,Russia,France and China there is no other nations which have the capacity to wage nuclear war with the same efficiency as the UK.,USA and France who all have the Trident missile.|`|67hMgqaUaa	There is a factor that has gone unmentioned,if we stopped training everyones elite forces wed have a far better chance. if it were a single battle there would be many countries that could beat us|`|6106bf75a443c7ad47b50d9b2b1cadc6aa	I would say that Britain would repel  any country that dared to attack her .  Does that count for not losing a war with any country in the world ?|`|AA10945047	perhaps The United States of the Aryans !|`|cekZba0Uaa	For sure, America, Isreal, and Russia.|`|467ecbd4310ef3dd4b4c9f341bb8e053aa	err... Scotland!|`|jyVp6woLaa	The entire world Labour would just surrender because it doesn't want to violate enemy troops human rights.|`|adb7eecb0a5b3b1c42e63b0bbaf7f8faaa	Probably America,or Germany if Hilter comes back for the dead for revenge.|`|ySp3iPAyaa	i am 100% american and i served with some brits they wont go easy or lay down and i would bet they would beat some countries that you would think they couldnt .any european country except russia def korea most arab nations all african nations all south american ,brazil austrailia,india pakistan,mexico all one on one|`|1h6IUwJmaa	USA, Russia, China, India.    These would beat Britain in a conventional war.    In an unconventional war(aka terrorists hiding with civilians), then it would depend on how supportive the people are.  If the britts can't just bomb the cities they will get bogged down(like currently in the middle-east) until popular support says pull the soldiers out.  if this is a win or a loose or nothing is really open to interpretation.|`|Vh3Kixa7aa	I'm a Brit but we would practically lose to everybody.|`|TUxPf25vaa	dude, u guys have got to respect the british.  they were fighting pretty much all of europe during world war 2 and survived. that takes a lot.  so they would probably lose against us and maybe china or israel  (russia military sucks)|`|rKpstdUcaa	USA obviously, China due to its sheer size|`|fxp8qIsIaa	Every one looses in war. But the british will just escalate it. so no one will ever win.The words Tactical Nuclear weapons comes to mind|`|o7zCOsUjaa	If there was actually a proper war, unlike the political wars they are fighting now against coward terrorists who hide amongst civilians or detonate themselves because they don't have the courage to stand up and fight fairly, then few countries would dare to take on and even fewer actually defeat the British. If there was a war worth fighting for (as in there was a threat of invasion to the country as in WW1 and WW2) then the British would never surrender until they could claim victory.     They have proved their worth and bravery many times, in ww1 and they stood almost alone in Europe in ww2. Britain is one of those countries that could never be occupied by a foreign ruler.    However I think Britain could be defeated by America and China due to their huge numbers and technology. China would simply send wave upon wave of troops at the british lines until they were overwelmed and America would simply use its power and nuclear weapons.     Those who say Israel would beat Britain need to rethink. Israel without America are nothing of a military power. They killed 4 of their own soldiers with their own tanks in Gaza in two separate incidents within a week! Whatever idiot said Iran needs to explain how exactly they would do that.    And finally, I think you'll find Britain smashed Argentina, despite being 8000 miles away and having all the odds stacked against them. With 258 dead to 649 Argentinian dead. 10 fighters to 25 lost Argentianian fighters and the sinking of the pride of the Argentinian Navy. That is an example of a fair, modern British war, and that was the outcome.|`|HIkXnqfzaa	We would not loose , as we would all die fighting.    remember that we Brits have a backbone|`|IK26tmcOaa	NONE.

AA11429715	I would be very surprised if pregnancy alone would result in cancellation of your visa, if your husband continues to work and is able to support the two of you.  You might even qualify for maternity leave, but probably not.

In fact, with the economy the way it is and so many people being laid off, you are at risk of having your visa cancelled at any moment, and you would have to go home immediately, pg or not.  Given the economy and your temporary work status, it would be extremely unwise to get pg now.  Wait until you get home.  Or have you already made that mistake?  Bad timing.

Many of the homes were overappraised even before they were sold. And since then they have lost a lot of value.     There are actually not all that many people in a position now to be rescued. People who have already lost their homes can't be saved.     But the biggest problem is that most of the "problem mortgages" don't exist. They are fake loans called "credit default swaps", intended to guarantee mortgage-based securities. There is no value to them now. All the money went to pay bonuses to bankers.|`|G6yyceAxaa	that has some bad Ju-Ju issues.    1.  government buys mortgages, (at overinflated prices as usual)  2. private sector buys back houses at cheap price from government  3. private sector sells houses for huge profit  4.

NO, absolutely not. I have been very careful, made good decisions in my life and worked very hard . . . MY money is my money to spend for what I want to spend it upon - not saving some bank or mortgage company.    When bank loans are made, they take a risk . . . BUT they make a ton of money on these risks (you pay back over 30-years over 400+% of what is borrowed).     When the loan plan fails and you lose - YOU lose.

3DOQG6hEaa	No, and as despicable as the things they say on here (some of them) are, what they say isn't treasonous either, unless they threaten to kill the President. Some of them are treasonists, in my opinion, but legally speaking they have to act on an attempt to remove the government, or actively work for a foreign agent to be considered treasonists legally.|`|1e9d3b83ee4eab612b90db60f5cea95daa	Nope.    Though personally I think that it does take a bit of anti-Americanism to be a republican.|`|AA11942937	You probably wish so!    we are going to be your worst nightmare if we disagree with obama.  Just like democrats were with Bush.    We will cut obama just as much slack as you did Bush.  Zilch!|`|AA11544192	Not treason.  But considering what a focus stealing was of the recently concluded Bush administration, a lot of Republicans could very easily be considered part of a criminal conspiracy and should be prosecuted for furthering the crimes of the Bush administration.|`|AA10690306	Nope, the Republicans were the only ones to claim anyone who disagreed with them were traitors.  Of course they also were the only ones who have made Americans "Disappear" into the legal system for up to a year without being charged or implicated in a crime.  They did this using three methods, 1) The Material Witness law  2) The Patriot Act  3)  The Military Powers Act.    Never take my word for it, check it out for yourself, research indefinite detentions of US Citizens within the US.|`|FjwdmI0oaa	If trying to keep your own money and spend it on your family and business instead of every lazy tax sucking bum is treason,  And yes it may be soon if the Dem's get there way.|`|YNoxY6Wwaa	Great question!!

And the mother of the 14 children isn't married, and didn't go to Iraq ... and it's her FATHER who went, the grandfather of the babies. No one knows who the dad is. The mom lives in a 3 bedroom house with her parents ... well now just with her mom, since her dad left to try to make money to support them all.    The question should be how an unmarried mother of six was able to get fertility treatments. And who paid for it.

If the family can't handle the fact that he has a miliary obligation, that isn't the military's fault.     There are times that call for "compassionate" reassignments, but I don't know that this would count. He needs to talk to his 1st Sgt and/or Company Commander.|`|9rhmeb7raa	Because they aren't married!|`|1Rl3zCG1aa	Having 14 kids is selfish, first of all.  There is no way you can give each child enough attention to fully nourish there emotional stability.

Also with law enforcement you'd have to check with academy schedules, if they are holding any openings for upcoming academies. That's your first step in law enforcement. If they aren't hiring there is your best bet to check. But I don't see any law enforcement agencies hiring without first going thru the academy then they don't promise anything.     Good luck.

AA10254694	India's indigenous rifle Vidhwansak (Sanskrit:"The Destroyer") is based on the South African Denel NTW-20/14.5 which allows changing of the caliber.    Vidhwansak has three variants, all are larger than the .50 cal NATO.  The 50 from BMG is 12.7 x 99 NATO.    Vidhwansak's three variants  12.7x108mm (.50 Russian)  14.5x114mm (about .572 cal)  20x 82mm (would be called .80 cal or 20mm cal)    The Indian Army has about 100 of these at 20,000US each.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidhwansak|`|ayhDyb16aa	yes they finally saved enough money to buy one|`|0jjzb97aaa	lemme check  0h! s0rry the security s0urce 0f india didn't tell me anything!!    mahn....... h0w w0uld we kn0w??|`|PZJdWBQiaa	yes, india has got.50 caliber rifle.
5g8YQAEwaa	MP school is at Fort Leonard Wood, MO. Basic Training and MP school are done in one block, in most instances. While yes, sometimes all you do is stand a post or patrol the streets, there is much more to the Military Police Corps than just "being a cop". Just to name a few opportunities, there is also Convoy Security, Corrections, guarding POWs, K9, SRT (which is our SWAT team), Route Recon (which is making sure that the roads travelled by the convoys are safe and free of trouble). In short, the 6+ years I have spent in the MP Corps have been a very rewarding, very educational experience for me. And as a suggestion, if you have the chance to retake the ASVAB, do it. 64 isn't a horrible score, but there is a low end cutoff if you want to be a MP. We don't take just anybody into our ranks.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Youll still take the test at MEPS, Im positive you will.  The training is not particularly hard, you will almost certainly pass.   The thing is that youll either love the job or totally hate it.   You are going to spend loads of time waiting around, doing guard duty, and things like that, and youll have to arrest people also. Its not a job for someone who is looking for respect or looking to be a big man, its for people who want self respect and like the feeling of doing the right thing.  If you are gung ho, dont think about this job, youll hate it and youll end up hurting people more than you help them. It requires a good deal of patience to do the right thing.|`|UZ8wsmuFaa	My father was trainer and top elite forces man here in Australia.    The things he put his trainees through would be much harder than what you will be doing. In terms of physical fitness you will have to be quite fit to pass your MP test, but attitude and stamina is usually more important than strength.      One thing he did with his recruits was to have hidden tests such as placing a wallet full of cash where you would be sent to go jogging. If you pocketed the cash you would immediately fail. For elite forces recruits almost any weakness is immediate failure.     I suspect MP training wil involve such testing. My dad apparently put his recruits through all sorts of temptations to get them to do the wrong thing or get distracted from their job.    My understanding is MPs physical has to be about avaerage or a little above. I.e. somewhere in the middle between raw recruits and eleite forces. I suspect the moral testing in MPs will be set pretty high.    In most countries the elite guys are much the same level but in Australia our top guys have to do multiple disciplines. E.g. expert in water land and air. I.e a combination of Navy Seal and Marine etc.
8dc5NMexaa	I think it is high time that you fully give up any thought of getting through this without a serious, a very serious, outlay of significant amount of money.  You ask "what do you experts think?"  You not only critically need to know what an expert thinks, you need to get the expert on board working for you.  It appears that you hope that she will not be unkind to you - and if so, then you are seriously misreading and somehow do not see the irrationality of her actions.  I am taking your words at face value, assuming the verity of your description.  Spend some time on the internet reading "Borderline Personality Disorder" or Malignant Narcissistic Personality Disorder" or "Histrionic Personality Disorder" or ...(one of the other personality disorders listed in the DSM-IV-R) or "Parental Alienation Syndrome," and links from these. Considering your comments, you may find a description of her psychological condition in one of these.  If not, then good for her and good for your child.  If so, then know that you must find a highly qualified respected attorney to carry that water into proof, and into showing that that personality disorder is one in which it is common to find "the making of false accusations."  At first you will consider a motion for mental examination for the parties.   And so if it is a small town, travel to the next one, or to the nearest city.  I think you must. I can understand that you were or are in counseling for depression, but you must fight legally now, and you can stay depressed and still fight on, as hard as that may be.  But be smart, and get a top-notch therapist and a top-notch attorney; otherwise despair may follow depression.  I am particularly struck by the fact that she could have had you served at any place, but she chose to set you up at the worst of places, i.e. your child's pre-school.  She is on a mission, and you get on a mission also but make your's an ethical and above-board one without erring on any negative side.  Keep your actions honest and geared to be positive to yourself, your child, and to her, but in doing so, be real and be truthful.  So borrow and have a good therapist and a good, no not just good but very good attorney.  My pleasure to share, and I did so taking your words at face value.   And have that attorney deal with the issue of whether or not to file a motion to recuse the particular judge.  Don't do that yourself.  Don't do much yourself except to carry on your normal life, studies and care for your child, when you are allowed.  You may be able to reverse all this, but you can't unless you seriously invest in it.
ymNM6mmzaa	This might be kind of a silly question, but here goes...    If you want to go "Active First," why don't you just join the Army?

I am employed as an MOD civilian at a TA unit, and can say that the situation in both theatres has not affected recruiting into the unit at which I work, in fact if anything, it has increased.    allan tay - a great many of TA members are ex-regulars and bring a wealth of experience with them, they are able to pass on his knowledge to their TA counterparts, who by they way, undergo OPTAG training as do Regular soldiers.

Who made this decision?  The tension in Iraq surely demands our most highly trained and capable troops if we are going to continue to be a presence there. The decision to send in the Territorial Army beggars belief.    The TA is now suffering a manning crisis with more than 36,000 soldiers quitting because of the war in Iraq.   A 3m television advertising campaign flopped, bringing in fewer than 600 recruits, and, at 35,000, the strength of the TA has dropped to half it strength since it was founded in 1907.     Only 12,000 TA soldiers are now available to back up the regular army on operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans.     The Ministry of Defence has repeatedly denied that the TA was in trouble as a result of Iraq, but the figures released to parliament show the situation is far worse.    Meanwhile Tony B Liar is asking us if he did the right thing.

Sense there are'nt many African American Republicans they think that when Republicans appoint an African American they're just doing it because they're black. I mean to me that could be the case. Sarah Palin was picked because she was a Woman. But that's politics. We live in a society in which that's helpful. Should it make a difference no. But it's like in this years Super Bowl do you think they're going to show guys in jock straps trying to be sexy in comercials? No they're going to show beautiful women in bras & panties trying to be sexy. Today the White Male is Like a Dude in A Jockstrap trying to be sexy in A Superbowl Comerical. No bodies interested in seeing it cause it's boring to the majority of the viewers & the audience wouldn't want to watch that & some would even vomit lol. I mean take Danica Patrick in Nascar is she a Token Female in Nascar? And honestly when so many people are making such a big deal out of Obama being black or half black really, it's not like they're not paying attention to those things either.     As far as people who say Steele doesn't represent African Americans & Palin doesn't represent Women. Well they're supposed to represent their party not any particular race or gender. Being Black or Female does not = Democrat. Reguardless of what the majority is. And as far as Females go there are A Lot of Females who are Republicans & Who Are Against Abortion. When it comes to Females I think Certain Media Groups Try to give a False Impression About the Way Females think About the Issues & Make It Look Like there are a Lot More Pro Choice Democrats than there are. I mean the way some of them talk you'd think it was a 90% to 10% ratio. And it's more like 60% to 40%. And when you bring that up the Dems will say oh well they're in the Dumb Red States. As if the States that have more women that vote for Reps than Dems shouldn't be Part of the Country.     Being a Black Republican doesn't make them Less Black. And being a Female Republican doesn't make them Less Female. Just Like Being A White Male Democrat doesn't make them Less White or Less Male. I mean just imagine if Republicans said you're not Of European descent if your a Democrat. Or you're not a Man if your a Democrat.|`|xagiOb80aa	I thought it was "Toking Black" and they were referring to his consumption of weed|`|kH0IxFa9aa	I would think so.

But as long as when his professional past is found out, he has proven he deserves the spot, that should die away quickly (provided it's actually happening).    Now if this is solely to try and attract minority voters, and the guy has no qualifications (I don't know yet one way or the other), then that would be racist and would make him a token black guy.    And it would be racist because it would show Republicans believe that black people are so stupid that they vote on race and not on substance.      But that is only if the guy has no qualifications.  If he is qualified, then he is no token black.

cR7Sf4cjaa	I live in Alaska, and, I was here when it blew in 1989.  1800 miles away, and we still got a half inch of nasty volcanic ash.  Local power company had to shut down the generators to save them.    Everyone is talking about the 1989 eruption........ but I was on Attu Island with a Russian vulcanologist back in the mid 1990's.  Attu is 1,000 miles against the prevailing west to east winds - some 200 years ago when Redoubt exploded it suceeded depositing a full 1/4 " of debris there.  That would be a substationally larger eruption than '89 - on the scale of Mt St. Hellens.  It could simply fizzle out and fade away........ or become truly spectacular planetary event.    The more Democrats and green weenies we can get on top of this thing now - the better.  Al Gore's fat @ss would make a perfect cork.  It's times like this when we could use more All Gore's and their fat @sses in the world - just a shame we only one to sacrifice.    Perhpas the Messiah in Washington himself will save us from the terrible tremblings of the volcano?      Hope this helps|`|9qQQrnR8aa	Nothing.

When the UN declared global warming a fact in 2006, they relied on a report from NASA.  The NASA scientist who had written the report then came out and said that the UN had removed two paragraphs from his report before they used it.  One removed paragraph said that there is no evidence that greenhouse gases have anything to do with the climate changes we have been seeing.  The other removed paragraph said that there is no evidence that human activity has anything to do with the greenhouse gases.  But the UN had their own agenda to espouse, so they did what most organizations do in that situation.  They simply lied, leaving out the information that would show that they were lying.  By so doing, they have done a profound disservice to the people they claim to protect, and they have helped cause the expenditure of huge amounts of money that could have been better used for other causes.|`|v1dnnMQuaa	Actually, it will not spew more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere than man has over the last 100 years.

Then he'll trade some other poor lunatic for carbon credits and throw him into the hole too.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Al Gore is on his way.     People, conservatives not in the least,  often made fun of the weight he gained, but once he heroically stops the erupting Alaskan volcano by taking a seat on top of it the joke will be on them!|`|AA11268819	Most likely praying to their god Obama to stop it.
Y4GAddyaaa	The media likes Colin Powell because he is an honorable, reasonable man.  Regarding Condi Rice, I never saw the MSM disrespect her.  If they did, it was only because she was in lockstep with Bush on the Iraq War.     Michael Steele is a hard Right Conservative in the mold of Palin.  He favors tax cuts for the wealthy, and opposes abortion for any reason.  I am sure the MSM will treat him fairly.    Obama is a charismatic man.  He can give speeches like few others in politics can.  He is inspiring, honest, and scary smart.  That type of politician comes around very seldom.

Hollywood, CNN, MSNBC, and the rest of the liberal bent media want someone with a democrat in office a liberal free spending, taxing like a son of a gun democrat.

tvNkizDraa	Good question!  Another thing that I find astounding about the bailout...  Supposedly the reason the financial institutions HAD to have a bailout was because they were "too big to fail".

Next time you go to your local store take note of how many facings are now being taken up by store and/or no-name brands.  Every facing represents a name brand that has been discontinued.

They deserve to live.    http://www.rainbowsbridge.com/Grief_Supp...    The Bible actually has much to say in regard to animal abuse. In the beginning, God created the earth and all the creatures on it to be under the authority of humanity. He entrusted these beautiful elements of His creation to our care (Genesis 1:26). Our sinful nature causes us to abuse these things, sometimes without even realizing it. Yet, God expects the Christian, above all others, to be sensitive to all of His creation, knowing that exploiting or abusing it shows a disrespect for God Himself. Abuse of anything that God made is not the character of God, but rather of the Evil One.    Domestic Animals: "A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel" (Proverbs 12:10). Throughout the Bible, God shows how He expects us to care for our animals in practical ways. In the Law of the Israelites, for example, one of the purposes of the Sabbath year of rest for the land, was to let the land lie fallow--and so that the poor as well as livestock and wild animals could eat from it (Exodus 23:11 and Leviticus 25:7). The Sabbath day itself was not only for humans to rest. God also commanded us to give our animals rest on the same day. (Exodus 20:10). He also commanded the Israelites to help both their friends and enemies when their ox or donkey had fallen over, or was carrying a burden too heavy for it to bear (Exodus 23:5 and Deuteronomy 22:4). In addition, livestock were also allowed to eat as they worked (Deuteronomy 25:4). Finally, God says to us in Proverbs 27:23: "Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds."??Part of the reason that God anointed young David to be king over Israel, was that he was a good shepherd and could be trusted with the sheep under his care, even risking his life for them when they were attacked by lions or bears (1 Samuel 17:34). God knew that if David had this sort of heart for his sheep, he would be a faithful shepherd over an even greater treasure--the people of Israel. ??Wild Animals--His eye is on the sparrow: In addition to domesticated animals, God also watches over wild animals and commands us to do the same. In Deuteronomy 22:6-7, God promises a long life to those who will watch over wild birds. If we rape the land or the creatures in it, what will sustain us in the future? He allows for the taking of eggs, but commands that we release the mother bird to continue living in the wild and reproducing as He intended. In Job 38:41, God says that He hears the cries of newborn ravens crying to Him for food. Jesus went on to say that God supplies food for the wild birds and that not one of them falls to the ground without Him knowing it (Matthew 6:26, 10:29). ??These small, but kind and practical commands written throughout the Bible give us good insight into how God expects us to treat animals. Surely we will have to answer to Him for any abuse that we have committed against them. God created animals for us to love and to learn from. In them, we see our own dependance upon God illustrated in their dependance upon us. We can also see elements of our foolishness manifested in them (who has not seen a crowing rooster and laughed at the comic caricature of ourselves crowing to all the world in our foolish pride?) In addition, God also tells us to learn from their wisdom:??"Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest" (Proverbs 6:6-8).??(Job 12:7-10 KJV) "But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind." ??Although worship of animals as deities is strictly forbidden in Scripture, we are to respect them as a part of God's creation. Some believe that because only humans were created in God's image, they alone are worthy of respect and care. Yet, the Bible tells us that even the angels were not created in God's image, yet we are to respect them! We are to respect all of God's created order, not to worship facets of it, but to see in it the same call that we ourselves have, which is to glorify God. All of God's creation was made with the ability and the power to glorify Him, each in different ways. In this, animals, as well as humans, share a common element with the rest of creation. Perhaps the words from these Psalms say it best of all (emphasis added):??Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise him from the heights above. Praise him all his angels, praise him, all his heavenly hosts. Praise him, sun and moon, praise him all you shining sta

AA10599026	She could take it to Family Court. It would never get as far as the Supreme Court, simply because a family court judge can order a DNA test and that's pretty much the end of it. In order to take a case to the Supreme Court, you have to go to Superior Court, then Appeals Court, then the state Supreme Court, then District Federal Court, then the Supreme Court -- and that's assuming the Supreme Court takes the case, which they more than likely would not. But assuming your stepmom is as crazy as she seems, it would be settled pretty much at the local level.    I don't understand how there can be no proof he is the father. She doesn't have to admit it, and the fact that he delivered the baby (wtf?) doesn't mean anything either - although if anything it should be proof that he might be, because why else would he deliver it? There should still be a birth certificate regardless of how and where the kid was born, and if your dad isn't listed as the father, he should take her to family court, press for a DNA test, and then when it's proven that the kid is his, he can fight for custody.

dHFBKR2xaa	Recognizing that I volunteered as a Ranger, fully knowing the hazards of my chosen profession,  I will always endeavor to uphold the prestige, honor, and high esprit-de-corps of the Rangers.    Acknowledging the fact that a Ranger is a more elite soldier who arrives at the cutting edge of battle by land, sea, or air,  I accept the fact that as a Ranger my country expects me to move further, faster and fight harder than any other soldier.    Never shall I fail my comrades.  I will always keep myself mentally alert, physically strong, and morally straight and I will shoulder more than my share of the task, whatever it may be, one hundred percent and then some.    Gallantly will I show the world that I am a specially selected and well-trained soldier.   My courtesy to superior officers, neatness of dress, and care of equipment shall set the example for others to follow.    Energetically will I meet the enemies of my country.  I shall defeat them on the field of battle for I am better trained and will fight with all my might.  Surrender is not a Ranger word.  I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy and under no circumstances will I ever embarrass my country.    Readily will I display the intestinal fortitude required to fight on to the Ranger objective and complete the mission, though I be the lone survivor.

If I was president I would raise the tariffs that Reagan lifted and give them two years to move back or pay a 30-40% tariff. That is Ok if companies was to move overseas but if they want to bring that crap back it will cost them to the point that they will have to have plants in the U.S. if they want to be profitable and sell to the number one consumers of useless crap.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	We need to create jobs in sectors where we excel - tech, science, intellectual property and health care to name a few. The Buy American provision falsely inflates the value of certain US industries which in turn hurts our ability to be globally competitive.|`|nNuLi83daa	I would if I would find products made in America|`|Jqg4hQyHaa	It sounds like the George Bush platitude that we can support the war by shopping.|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	I kinda agree with you but my problem is that Unionization of businesses always raises prices.  Is there a company alive that has survived Uniions, (even Hollywood is getting a bailout).  Unions cause inflation in every thing they touch!    Cost of Unions are in their "rules"  One person cannot do a job that is deemed "not their job" because it belongs to another union category.  Therefore, the costs of doing business skyrocket.  Example:  Have you ever tried to set up a booth at a convention - one person puts down your flooring (slowly and taking breaks on your time) while another sets up your furniture, another charges you for carrying in a box, etc. etc.  Its painfully ridiculous.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	What would you say if the government told you that you had to buy from the failed auto companies that went to the government and asked for YOUR tax money, in which the only thing you get out of it is the pleasure of buying one of their products? Doesn't sound fair to me. That would literally be the opposite of "buying American".     Buying a Nissan at this point is more "American" since they didn't commit a traitorous act against the American people by requesting a free ride on THEIR backs while Toyota has to follow the rules of competition. It's actually quite disgusting. And all the others who went to the government for bail out money as well. Imagine if you were required to not only bail out companies that fail, but you were required to buy their products. Man, it just makes my skin crawl.|`|9o7Bs8enaa	I agree. But I do not agree with the stimulus bill, it will bankrupt us.|`|Juw2uckPaa	I was always taught to sweep your own doorstep and if you have time leftover you can help someone else. There are thing made in America, you just have to have enough money to shop at the right places. The global economy is just to help keep the wealthy well off. They are the ones who have the lobbyists to lobby congress and so on, not the working class. As for the unions, there are no strong unions in this country anymore if you think they are the reason for high prices. Check out the Exxon earnings. That is just a ruse to keep unions from being here. Unions started in this country so people wouldn't have to work all day for pennies and sometimes be denied that. The fall of the unions started when Ronald Reagan was in office. So did deregulation.  Yes, of course we should buy American and keep America strong. I think we should charge the same tariffs on those American companies who go overseas and have things made and then bring them back into this country as we do on products from foreign countries.|`|7pf2pGBUaa	agree, but it will never happen|`|mEPfHzW7aa	Yes.

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Guantanamo Bay Naval Base is located on the shore of Guantnamo Bay at the southeastern end of Cuba and has been used by the United States Navy for more than a century. It is the oldest overseas U.S. Navy Base, and the only one in a country with which the United States does not have diplomatic relations.    The Cuban government opposes the presence of the naval base, claiming that the lease is invalid under international law. The US government claims that the lease is valid.    Since 2002, the naval base has contained a military prison, the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, for persons alleged to be enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan and later in Iraq. Prior to July 11, 2006 the Bush Administration maintained that these prisoners are not protected under the Geneva Conventions, although saying that the Geneva Conventions would be respected as a matter of policy. After the U.S. Supreme Court rejected that view, Bush Administration officials indicated that they had little choice but to act in the aftermath of that Supreme Court ruling. They disputed the suggestion that the new Pentagon policy represents significant change, because the Bush Administration already said that it treats detainees humanely.|`|lEaT5q06aa	spanish american war  relatively small, but i do not know the acreage/sq mile size|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	It's the Navy that's there.

Why not?|`|SGyRIjCIaa	Yes, he has a bachelors from Johns Hopkins University in international relations. He spent 3 years at a seminary preparing to be a priest and taught but before he took the vows, he made a decision to pursue law at Georgetown and where he received his juris doctor. He has experience from being the chairman of the Maryland Republican party since 2000. He has served as a Lieutenant Governor since 2003 in Maryland. He is a great speaker - he gave the keynote address at the RNC convention in 2004. I know speaking well shouldn't matter but look what it has done for Obama. And as of recently, he was the chairman of GOPAC in 2007. Along the way he has practiced law at a prestigous law firms in D.C. He was born on Andrews Air Force base. He grew up in northwest D.C... so he most definately knows how to handle Washington.    He is very good at crossing over and isn't afraid to step on peoples toes like some of the other republicans. He isn't afraid to offend. He has some stances on issues that are much more moderate than any other RNC chair we've had. But he's also a family man with a wife and two kids. He had to work his way up and struggled with education until he found the right career.    Other things:  -He describes himself as a "Lincoln Republican"  -He served on the National Federal Election Reform Commission and the NAACP Blue Ribbon Commission on Election Reform. He fights for fairness for people of color but not for free rides or exceptions.  -Strong catholic  -He is very, very good with the media and has experience with other big time political news shows (he's been on Bill Maher, Colbert, etc.)  -He knows technology. He is ready to use new ways of getting the word out just as the democrats did this year.  -Plain and simple: Pro-life  -He comes from a "blue state" (maryland) and can appeal to the northeast moderates.  -He believes in small government. Enough said.    He will rebuild this party. I know it hard to trust at a time where things are such a mess but this is a very good choice. It's exactly what the republicans need to have a chance in 2012. Don't just think he was chosen because the RNC wanted to make a statement. He can do a great job - and most importantly he has a RECORD of doing so!|`|gWMMD81Jaa	He was Lt.

They have missed the appeal deadlines and there would have to be a very strong case for missing this which normally applies to employees rather than employers ( eg the individual was hospitalised etc. This is not so likely in the case of a  company so I doubt they will be entertained but it may be another stalling tactic not to pay you especially if theya re about to wind up and you simply become one of their creditors.|`|57cde3b40c8e13776466f03b5d32b909aa	Employment Tribunal Rules and Procedures do allow extensions but only in extreme circumstances short of being stuck on the moon or the south pole the tribunals are reluctant to use these powers. It would be up to your employers solicitors to be able to argue this case effectively in order for the judgement to be set aside. <br>  With regard to the winding up this could be more problematic. there are 3 scenarios.<br>  1, If the compensation was granted against an individual you are OK.<br>  2, If the compensation was "jointly" from a person and the company (rare but possible in discrimination cases). here again you may be OK the company may not be able to pay but because the compensation is joint it can be claimed back from the individual company.<br>  3, If the judgement was solely against the company then you will become a creditor and will not have priority for your debt to be paid.<br>  <br>  It may be interesting to find out what kind of business it was, if a limited company then you will have difficulty claiming any compensation if it goes into receivership if however it is a partnership then there is still a chance you would be able to claim your compensation

That is when they are tossed, and they pull themselves back together and get back to their roots.

7223f6329c1b8f559e8cc2c7612148b8aa	You need to narrow it down. OK, serial killers-how the insanity defense works, tried in the press. How eithical is it for the defendant to make money on book and movie deals. Or just pick a case/killer how where they defended? How did the prosecuter present his/her case? Was there evidence left out?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|be8b7dae66f52218db776f6f214495dbaa	The risk of using serial killers is that your fascination with the crimes will distract from the actual legal ethics questions that you are hopefully trying to answer.  From a legal/ethical standpoint, most serial killer cases are pretty simple ethically, but consider generalizing a little bit to serial killers and other high-profile cases.  Consider looking at the relationship between attorneys and the media.  Specifically, to what extent can the prosecutor and defense attorney ethically communicate with the media in high-profile cases?  Or consider looking at media access to these cases (public right-to-know versus judge's restrictions on cameras in the courtroom, etc.).<br>  <br>  You might also look at the ethical restrictions placed on a defense attorney's ability to handle evidence.  What happens if a murder suspect tosses his gun to his defense attorney?  What can the defense attorney do with it?  What happens if a client decides to show his attorney where the bodies are?  What if a client tells his attorney that he will kill someone, and the attorney believes it?  Must the attorney tell?  Can the attorney tell?  In what states?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|f3d9ddb056b1ec0353818f93389bfc34aa	Can't help you with seriel killers and ethics in law.<br>  <br>  How about seriel child predators and ethics?<br>  <br>  How about taking on the ethical bankruptcy of allowing child predators off on probation?

I mean just 400 years ago Spain was the wealthiest country in the world and look at them now.<br>  <br>  Also, capitalism throughout history never tends to sustain itself... usually ending in some sort of breakdown or revolution. This is usually due to the gap between the rich and poor becoming so great that the masses end up revolting.. a revolution. <br>  <br>  Our country, as you can read in some of the forefather's writings, was suppose to be capitalism with accountability.. as we can see from this 'culture of corruption' that isn't working anymore.<br>  <br>  So with the masses beginning to lose all faith in their government, outsourcing of all types of jobs, and big business's loss of all loyalty to their country, I estimate at most 50 years before we will be a 3rd world country.<br>  <br>  And the irony is that I estimate China, a communist state, will be the next great superpower.

The U.S. Senate 6/2005 transcript<br>  <br>  "Now, Senator, I gave my heart and soul to oppose the policy that you promoted. I gave my political life's blood to try to stop the mass killing of Iraqis by the sanctions on Iraq which killed one million Iraqis, most of them children, most of them died before they even knew that they were Iraqis, but they died for no other reason other than that they were Iraqis with the misfortune to born at that time. I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit in invading Iraq. And I told the world that your case for the war was a pack of lies. <br>  <br>  “I told the world that Iraq, contrary to your claims did not have weapons of mass destruction. I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to al-Qaeda. I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to the atrocity on 9/11 2001. I told the world, contrary to your claims, that the Iraqi people would resist a British and American invasion of their country and that the fall of Baghdad would not be the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning. <br>  <br>  "Senator, in everything I said about Iraq, I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong and 100,000 people paid with their lives; 1600 of them American soldiers sent to their deaths on a pack of lies; 15,000 of them wounded, many of them disabled forever on a pack of lies. <br>  <br>  If the world had listened to Kofi Annan, whose dismissal you demanded, if the world had listened to President Chirac who you want to paint as some kind of corrupt traitor, if the world had listened to me and the anti-war movement in Britain, we would not be in the disaster that we are in today. Senator, this is the mother of all smokescreens. You are trying to divert attention from the crimes that you supported, from the theft of billions of dollars of Iraq's wealth. <br>  <br>  "Have a look at the real Oil-for-Food scandal. Have a look at the 14 months you were in charge of Baghdad, the first 14 months when $8.8 billion of Iraq's wealth went missing on your watch. Have a look at Halliburton and other American corporations that stole not only Iraq's money, but the money of the American taxpayer. <br>  <br>  "Have a look at the oil that you didn't even meter, that you were shipping out of the country and selling, the proceeds of which went who knows where? Have a look at the $800 million you gave to American military commanders to hand out around the country without even counting it or weighing it. <br>  <br>  "Have a look at the real scandal breaking in the newspapers today, revealed in the earlier testimony in this committee. That the biggest sanctions busters were not me or Russian politicians or French politicians. The real sanctions busters were your own companies with the connivance of your own Government."|`|62722318232c81986840d7aa35854bc4aa	Certainly a factor.

If Iraq were are full production of it's oil Americans would be paying about $1.25 for gas right now.<br>  <br>  The war in Iraq keeps the price of oil high and that makes the Saudis and the Iranians very happy (Iranians use that extra cash for their nuclear weapons program).

a03cedfe2f07cdb5f29abc1810db16abaa	The first thing you should know is that these questions typically get lots of answers from people who really don't have a clue what they are talking about. <br>  <br>  The first thing you should do is read the story of why marijuana was outlawed in the first place <a href="http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/whiteb1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/...</a> It is funny and fascinating. <br>  <br>  In short, marijuana was outlawed because of racial prejudice against Mexicans and because of the fear that heroin addiction would lead to the use of marijuana -- exactly the opposite of the modern gateway myth. The head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics knew the laws were unenforceable from the very beginning so he reasoned that the only way to combat marijuana was through a campaign of stupendous lies. For example, the US Official Expert on marijuana testified in court, under oath, that marijuana would make your incisors grow six inches long and drip with blood. He went on to say that, when he tried marijuana, it turned him into a bat.<br>  <br>  As you can see from the responses above, there are still a lot of people who believe these things.<br>  <br>  Then you should take a look at <a href="http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/studies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/...</a>  This is a collection of the full text of most of the major government commission reports on drugs over the last 100 years. They all concluded that there was no justification for making marijuana illegal for any purpose. They all said it should be legalized completely -- not just for medical use. <br>  <br>  For those who say that the active ingredient is available in Marinol -- this is a really dumb argument. First, it proves conclusively that the marijuana plant really does have medicinal properties. If there is a prescription drug made from it, then -- obviously -- it has medicinal properties. That alone should prove that putting marijuana in Schedule I (high potential for abuse, no medical use) is nonsense.<br>  <br>  What these people will fail to tell you is that the US Government currently distributes big tin cans full of 300 marijuana joints to a number of patients each month. The reason they do this is because some of those patients went to court and proved to a legal certainty that marijuana is the only medicine suitable for their needs.<br>  <br>  The legal Federal patients report similar experiences with the prescription drug Marinol. They report:<br>  1) Marinol doesn't work as well to relieve their symptoms. This is probably due to the fact that there is more than one medicinal ingredient in the plant.<br>  2) The pills cost at least 15 dollars each, which many of these people simply can't afford.<br>  3) Pills are no good if you have nausea and just throw them up as soon as you take them. Inhaled medicines are better in that case.<br>  4) It is harder for them to get a therapeutic dose with the pill without getting a "debilitating" high. The pill only comes in two doses and it takes a half hour to know whether the right amount was taken. With marijuana smoking, they can take light puffs and then wait a minute to see if they got the right medical effect without too much of the "high". It is much easier to get the right dose.<br>  <br>  I have met thousands of people who used marijuana for medicinal purposes, including a number of the people who get their medical marijuana directly from the US Federal Government. To date, not one of them has reported that the Marinol pill is an acceptable substitute.<br>  <br>  Of course, that is the same conclusion that the US Institute of Medicine reached in their report, too. They concluded that there are some patients for whom there is simply no good alternative to medical marijuana. They recommended that patients be allowed to use it. You can read their entire report in the collection of major studies of the subject at <a href="http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/studies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/...</a>  <br>  <br>  Contrary to the misinformation posted by others:<br>  -- the pill gets people "higher" than the plant.<br>  -- It is harder to regulate the dose with the pill<br>  -- the pill is in Schedule III, not Schedule II. The fact that the primary active ingredient is in Schedule III, while the plant itself is in Schedule I further proves that the current laws make no sense.<br>  -- you should know that the US Federal Government has made it next to impossible to do real research on marijuana for decades now. Basically, anyone who attempts to do anything that might contradict the party line is either ignored or outright attacked. That is a whole other story in itself. <br>  <br>  I can guarantee you that all those people who say that there is no medical use for cannabis have never read the most basic research on the subject. They couldn't pass a basic quiz on the subject to save their own lives. How do I know? I have quizzed them literally thousands of times. Read the research I have linked and you will see what I mean.|`|8c21901f1ceff458aaee34639d61afa9aa	Yes. Medically it is allowed here.

It does not make me more knowledgable than thenext person, but it does certainly add a little bit of passion to the subject...<br>  There are really no other medications that have the same mechanisms of action as marijuana. Dronabinol (Marinol) is available by prescription in capsules, but has the distinct disadvantage of containing only synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is only one of many therapeutically beneficial cannabinoids in the natural plant.<br>  People suffering from AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and other serious or terminal illnesses sometimes turn to marijuana on the advice of their doctors when other treatments fail. DC's Initiative 57 would protect these patients, their doctors, and immediate caregivers from criminal prosecution in the use of marijuana in medical treatment. The tightly worded measure, proposed by the local AIDS activist group ACT UP, requires that medical marijuana be restricted to use under the supervision and care of a licensed physician. <br>  <br>  Initiative 57 firmly establishes that medical decisions are best determined within the doctor-patient relationship, not politicians or government prosecutors. Volunteers have until December to gather approximately 16,700 signatures of DC registered voters to place Initiative 57 on the DC ballot. <br>  <br>  Jailing sick and dying patients, in the name of public safety, is used by politicians trying to look tough on drugs. Under current law, the seriously ill who turn to marijuana for its possible therapeutic effects are subject to arrest, criminal prosecution, and incarceration. <br>  <br>  Caregivers have no other option but to enter dangerous open air drug markets to purchase the marijuana that might provide some comfort to loved ones in their final days. Physicians who even discuss the possible benefits of marijuana in the medical treatment of their patients have been targeted by federal prosecutors. <br>  <br>  Many AIDS patients have found relief with marijuana to ease severe nausea and vomiting, and to help counter the loss of appetite and weight loss of deadly AIDS wasting syndrome. Expensive new triple-combination therapies hold little promise for those AIDS sufferers who are unable to hold their pills down. <br>  <br>  Cancer patients enduring the side effects of radiation and chemo-therapy sometimes find relief in marijuana. For over twenty years, marijuana has successfully treated some patients with glaucoma, one of the leading causes of blindness among Americans. <br>  <br>  For those sick and dying patients who use marijuana to ease their suffering, marijuana is hardly a recreational drug. Withholding from these is patients a potentially life-saving therapy is criminal. <br>  <br>  Initiative 57 simply provides legal protection to these patients, their physicians, and caregivers in the medical use of marijuana from prosecution of DC's Uniformed Controlled Substances Act. The DC initiative is much tighter than measures passed by voters in California and Arizona. <br>  <br>  Under the provisions of Initiative 57, non-medical use of marijuana is explicitly prohibited. Use of medical marijuana, like other prescription medicines, cannot defend against any other crime, such as driving while intoxicated. DC activists have included a parental consent clause, Section 9 of Initiative 57, which prohibits the distribution of medical marijuana to any person under the age of 18 for the treatment of a minor's medical condition, without the informed, written consent of a parent or legal guardian. <br>  <br>  The marijuana sold by drug dealers on the streets is sometimes laced with drugs or other contaminates. Initiative 57 would allow legal, non-profit corporations or cooperatives to ensure a safe supply of marijuana to patients, taking drug dealers out of the equation. Patients are limited under Initiative 57 in the quantities they are permitted to possess. <br>  <br>  The integrity of the doctor-patient relationship is protected under Initiative 57 by allowing physicians to defend the medical-use of their patients before a judge in sealed testimony. Federal prosecutors are outflanked in their attempts to target physicians who discuss medical marijuana as an option for patients. <br>  <br>  The local petition effort is drawing national attention from those who have shown little interest in the well being of the people of the District of Columbia. The DC campaign for Initiative 57 is turning into the first Republican primary of the 2000 presidential election. Billionaire publisher and former presidential candidate Malcolm 'Steve' Forbes Jr. has loudly launched a big money media campaign against Initiative 57, calling the AIDS activists sponsoring the measure "twisted drug predators." William Bennett, the failed drug czar under President George Bush, is directing opposition to Initiative 57 through his group Empower America. Representatives from the Family Research Council, headed by Reagan Administration domestic policy adviser Gary Bauer, tried to block Initiative 57 at the DC Board of Elections and Ethics, but they were unable to find a DC voter to oppose the initiative. <br>  <br>  Reacting to pressure, Drug Czar General Barry McCaffery has weighed in, opposing the petition drive in a letter sent to local DC officials. <br>  <br>  McCaffery's office admits that they have not yet reviewed the legislative text of Initiative 57. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, amid the posturing of presidential aspirants, open air drug markets and crack houses in DC continue to flourish. The Drug Detox Center at DC General Hospital is overflowing. Waiting lists for drug treatment slots grow as funding for these life-saving programs has been eliminated. <br>  <br>  Drug king-pins continue to import crack cocaine for sale in our city, and the Lorton prison complex. Yet these pressing problems, so apparent to DC residents, have failed to grab the attention of political grandstanders, much like Nero fiddling while Rome burned. <br>  <br>  By supporting DC Initiative 57, the people of the District of Columbia can free those suffering from AIDS, cancer, and other serious illnesses from the threat of prosecution and imprisonment if their doctor recommends relief in marijuana as a medication of last resort.|`|225fb1fa1cb9facc9db1570da94bf405aa	Before I answer this question, I want everybody to know that I really don't care about marijuana.  I am just a guy who calls it like I see it.  <br>  <br>  Medical marijuana is a joke and it should not be made legal.  Although there are therapeutic qualities to marijuana, these can be given through other, safer, drugs that don't get you high.  With all the information we have now about smoking, do you really believe that any medical professional in their right mind would prescribe you a smoked drug?  Not one I would see.  The dosage cannot be regulated, and the risk of harm far outweighs any potential benefit.  <br>  <br>  Also, in response to a previous answer, the indians did not smoke marijuana.  Regardless of what marijuana advocates tell you, the plant is not native to the United States.|`|c0409627d09f8c2f38561958fd52a476aa	I have some difficulty justifying my position, as I'm coming close to feeling the need for socialization of medicine in the U.S.: single-payor, tax-supported, universal coverage, somewhat as a public utility. I come to this position quite painfully as my general political views tend to have a highly libertarian bent.<br>  "Medical marijuana" shouldn't be allowed. Marijuana should be decriminalized in general.<br>  The medicalization of marijuana use without general decriminalization is a wrong-headed idea, to wit:<br>  Marinol, a cannabinoid, is already available as a Schedule II drug.<br>  Any benefits of marijuana beyond those of Marinol have yet to be proven. There will be those who do not believe that statement, but let me explain. To legalize marijuana for medical use, the proper method, and there is a legal mechanism, is to apply for the proper permits and do controlled medical trials, and go through the same new drug application process as with any new drug. The FDA reviews the data, and if there is adequate data to approve the drug, it is allowed. Decades ago the University of Mississippi set up a project growing marijuana under controlled conditions for study purposes. Its business seems not to have been brisk.<br>  The FDA has taken a lot of heat for being too willing to allow new drugs to enter the market, and this is wildly past just the opposite, using raw politics to make a complete end-around on the drug-approval process that has been so painstakingly developed.<br>  I might add a related anecdote. Some years ago the state of TN's medical board had a policy of not allowing amphetamine-like drugs to be used for weight reduction. There was a popular outcry, and the legislature overrode the board's position in the specific case of the wonderful combination Fen-phen, and I think we all know how that worked out.<br>  Also, there is some misinformation posted. There is NO legal "medical marijuana" in your state. There may be no state prohibition, but it's still a federal violation, so I'd avoid smoking in front of FBI agents, etc.|`|AA11524396	No, I know wut drugs can do to you (see my previous song to the Amerrcan peple).

He served in that office from November 5, 1781 until November 3, 1782. He was the first President to serve a full term after the full ratification of the Articles of Confederation – and like so many of the Southern and New England Founders, he was strongly opposed to the Constitution when it was first discussed. He remained a confirmed anti-federalist until his untimely death.<br>  <br>  Six other presidents were elected after him - Elias Boudinot (1783), Thomas Mifflin (1784), Richard Henry Lee (1785), Nathan Gorman (1786), Arthur St. Clair (1787), and Cyrus Griffin (1788) - all prior to Washington taking office. Why don't we ever hear about the first seven Presidents of the United States? It's quite simple - The Articles of Confederation didn't work well. The individual states had too much power and nothing could be agreed upon. A new doctrine needed to be written - something we know as the Constitution. <br>  <br>  George Washington was definitely not the first President of the United States. He was the first President of the United States under the Constitution we follow today. And the first seven Presidents are forgotten in history.|`|bffd50c523ea2d8ae7b50768f698be3aaa	John Hanson.

5c07eea93e2b7eb3dfa4e16ee3a3c43eaa	a) Walter has comitted at least two torts.  He has assaulted Steve, in that he has threatened Steve with imminent harmful contact, and he has falsely imprisoned Steve.  For the assault, Steve must believe that there is an imminent threat, and that Walter can carry out the threat.  An armed security guard is likely to be able to carry out a threat about hurting someone. Although there is an exception for false imprisonment which allows police officers to detain suspects, Walter is not a Police officer.  There is also an exception known as the shopkeepers privilege, which allows store owners to hold people suspected of actually stealing for a limited time.  It is a limited exception, and six hours is likely too long to hold someone under the shopkeepers privilege, on top of that, Walter probably did not have enough information to believe that Steve had stolen anything.<br>  <br>  b.BUG is likely vicariously liable for Walter's actions.  Unless Walter is an independent contractor, severing Bug's vicarious liability, then because Walter is an employee of Bug, Bug is liable under the theory of respondeat superior.  There are usually exceptions for assault and battery by an employee, but when the employee's job reasonably puts them into confrontational circumstances, such as bouncers or security guards, then that exception is nullified.

He doesn't try to impress; instead, he articulates his statements in a clear and concise manner.  Notice that unlike Obama, he does not stop and say "ah" and "um" all the time.  He is soft-spoken and isn't it nice to actually have people who aren't out to simply impress people with their vocabulary.  I remember seeing him speak on TV at the RNC last year and took an instant liking to him.  I can't say anything about whether he was picked because he is Black; I hope that people could overlook this finally and simply look at what he represents and his vision for the party going forward.  Maybe race may have had something to do with it, who knows - but if you look at the party right now, it does not draw a lot of visible minority support.  I think having Steele at the helm will help people see that the Republicans are just as inclusive as the Democrats.  I wish Mr. Steele well and hope to see him revitalizing the party going forward.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	he's the political opposite of obama - i would not have chosen him|`|cq0f8LtDaa	I like him. Good pick.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Where have you been. He is the man.|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Nope. Looks like Liberals got their talking points for the evening.|`|Sqp6HjtMaa	They truely picked him for what they hated the most. They picked him for his skin color. Dumbest move ever. I laugh at Cons.|`|13920962b7119a1b4d44ad9700a88994aa	I would put him to a test with Obama anyday.

Michael Steele makes Obama look like a sophist!|`|ZxtEh7yZaa	Haha....that's like calling the kettle black. No pun intended! Obambi cannot even string two sentences together without saying ah, ah, ah, ah typical of someone who has to think about what he has previously lied about. It is a telltale sign for criminal profilers to judge the truthfulness of a suspect.|`|spuz7DvNaa	The Republicans tried and tried to find someone like Obama( that spent a lifetime seeking friendships with criminals, communist, socialist, marxists, racists and bigots) but they just couldn't find any Republicans with the qualities equal to Obama.|`|TJtifnxPaa	Gee, whiz, that's exactly how Republicans describe Barack Obama. He speaks clearly and looks nice, but has nothing to say of any substance. I'd say he's exactly at his level, based on your description of him, except without the ties to Chicago corruption, Bill Ayers, Rev. Wright....etc, etc. Republicans don't want someone equal to Obama. They want someone better.|`|RMjcHfGTaa	Michael Duncan sucked and the party was going down hill so he's out.  Two of the other 5 quit.  Out of the 3 left, Steele was the only one with anything of a plan.    Chairmanship in the GOP is done by the higher-ups.  Personally, I'm willing to see what he can do.
mBZU9a1Baa	It really depends on the size of the eruption. Any dust and particulates (ash) might reach an altitude of 100 miles into the atmosphere, and could potentially travel around the world, depending on the height and prevailing wind patterns.    The more ash & debris in the atmosphere, the more sunlight which is blocked out...thus cooling off the earths surface.    Of course, Al Gore will say that it will increase global warming, because lava is hot!|`|YczLYtWjaa	don't ask us....ask Al Gore|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	wow gore must be happy for the volcano|`|c41f84986e1b8e191747b9c81200eafdaa	Snow.. lots of snow...|`|t82AcQT1aa	Oh I'm sure Gore and his minions will come up with some stupidity about it.

Mind you, I think McCain sucked as a candidate, but I don't really know anything about Michael Steele except that he is black.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Sure.

He had moral values, and spoke the truth. He had integrity, unlike the two mentioned, who are what England called "red hats" during the war.|`|ab0507069beb3cfdfdcee35075af07feaa	No, ..he was BETTER. Ronald Reagan in his day was one of Hollywood's leading male actors and starred in several good films that are entertaining to this very day. He may not have ever won an Oscar for his films, but neither has Brad Pitt or Samuel L. Jackson (both are probably among the best actors in Hollywood today).    What exactly has Paris Hilton and/or Britney Spears done that was so great? Britney Spears is such a whack job the courts won't even let her near her own kid! And while Paris Hilton isn't exactly a rhodes scholar, her only claims to fame is a pretty incredible body and face and a family that happens to have more money than God!|`|G9VOOzS9aa	Nah, man- Reagan had class as an actor. Paris? Just what DOES she do? And Britney...|`|TKbYavhzaa	He starred across a monkey, whereas the two mentioned are more into Chihuahuas.  Otherwise, not so different.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	I wouldn't call Britney or Paris an actor.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	He was in movies.

They "brand" themselves as fiscally conservative, while govt spending always goes up under Repub presidents.    They have never been socially liberal except when they are trying to attract voters.

u2HV0MaHaa	It amazes me to think that people think a party needs to go away from its core values just to get votes. I believe that the republican party will get back in power as soon as they realize that the more you conform the more left you become.   Frankly I don't care if all the independents vote Dem from this point on. Of course if they did that they wouldn't be real independents would they.?  Independents like the moniker because it makes them think that they have more control over outcomes of elections then they really do.

HlYzvJ51aa	Depends on the reason you are not working:    If you quit your job or got fired, then nothing happens. The current amount just accrues and when you do get a job they will garnish your wages. IF your ex does not file a contempt first and have you arrested for willingly denying support.    If you were laid off, then you need to file for a modification with the court seeking a decrease in the amount due to a change in circumstance. At that point they will base your child support off of minimum wage instead of your current hrly until the point you regain employment.    By the way if you can PROVE you were paying the mortgage by cancelled checks or some other method and the child were living in the home (school records) the court will consider that support and throw that order out. IF you have proof that is.|`|f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	Your children need to eat. You still owe them support. Being out of work is not an excuse. http://www.lawhelp.org/documents/1480213...

The problem was and is, people were expecting too much of him.  Obama supporters were so wrapped up in their disdain for Bush, Obama seemed like the logical choice.  Everyone put their hopes and dreams on him.      Obama was a bad choice.  His associations and everything with Bill Ayers, ACORN, fraud, and corruption were ignored.  Then he becomes President and immediately starts everything he said would would NOT do.      His first major interview as President was for the benefit of the enemies of this country.  There's some speculation that he said, "America is a Muslim country."      Obama said he would not give special interest groups any consideration.  He has done just that.  Obama said he would get this country back on its feet and working.  This huge "stimulus" bill is just that.  A huge bill that others will have to pay.  It gives millions and billions to pork, illegals, and other subsidies that will do nothing to stimulate the economy or create jobs.      I'm more puzzled that more people didn't see this coming.

It's not smart to give someone you know nothing about a "chance" to run the country for 4 years.      As far as being tired of Bush, the only buildings that have fallen down in this country since 9/11 are the ones we've knocked down ourselves.  If Obama fixes the economic mess, but doesn't keep the crazy muslims at bay you can bet people will tire of his policies, too.  Blood is thicker than water.....it's thicker than money, too.

I  the end, they broke even financially. The difference,if they work part-time, they are home more. It is basically a welfare check. We can offer tax credits to help families pay for insurance. There are ALOT of affordable plans out there. Government regulations have pushed the cost of price plans through the roof.|`|uzf7nuLnaa	Normally I'd say yes, but, this time I have to say no.  Here in California everything is done "for the children".  There is no free medical for adults unless they have dependent children.  This is because we are a border state and are overrun by illegals crossing the border with their children who are eligible for all of those "for the children" freebies.

However don't deny that it was a political move.      Steele has been around the GOP political scene for years and wasn't even considered for the position until Obama won.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"When did the Democrats decide that they owned all the blacks"    Ever since 1856.|`|RRTDRSw1aa	none of that matters. we are ruled by the zionist banksters and their puppet politicians. wake up and smell the coffee.|`|f598d30e60d0a8ecbb5bd782a442def6aa	There's nothing "wrong" with it. But if it isn't obvious enough, it's a ploy to sway some voters who went democrat because of Obama. Black democrat is elected president, republicans now have to follow suit. It's all a game in politics.    Republicans are allowed to say Obama just got votes because he was black? How is this different for the other side?|`|spuz7DvNaa	I was hoping they would choose Micheal Steele. He has been a favorite of mine for some time.    You will find throughout history it was the Democrats that were the racist. They just ride on the backs of anyone to further their interest. Look how they were up in arms against blacks moving into the SF area recently.|`|iLTlJszaaa	You're right.  Let's not forget that it was the Republican Party that ended slavery, that it was the Democrats who were all members of the KKK and who were enacting Jim Crow laws and maintaining political power in the post-war period in the South, using intimidation to prevent blacks from voting.  And now they endorse affirmative action, which is basically telling blacks that they can't succeed without special help from the government.  Martin Luther King, Jr. was a Republican.  So was Abraham Lincoln.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Nothing.  However there would be something wrong if he was selected simply because he's African American in light of the fact that our new democratic president is also African American.  That would be a condescending form of racism.  That would be the republican party saying to the black community "Hey look!  We got one too!".  That would be like a presidential candidate picking a woman as his running mate simply because there was a popular woman running in the opposition party.  Theoretically speaking, of course.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Theres nothing wrong with it. Michael Steele will be the first black President. Obama is more White and Arab then black.

nxymxSUFaa	Sarah Palin is a new face to national politics.  We still don't know a great deal about her.  She is far from damaged goods.  I think she has a great deal of potential and as time goes by she will have ample opportunity to show what she is made of.  Maybe a little young and inexperienced to run the country now but in four or even eight years from now it may very well be a different story.  After all, who knew who Obama was four years ago?|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Too early to say but she's still a potential candidate.|`|6nS62bB8aa	I don't see her in either light. Definitely NOT damaged goods, and yet not quit ready for prime time.    My long term dream is to see Sarah Palin taking a little more of the spotlight each year until at least 2016.     I love her to pieces, but she just can't come out of Alaska one day and take over. It's too much like Jimmy Carter coming out of Georgia, and throwing the country down the drain.|`|YIWKPXokaa	She is both.|`|AA11398340	Palin/2012 yea baby back core values and morals stand tall and proud Americas wake up call enough of this crap liberal policies the only ones who are suffering now just are not prepared for it.|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Far too early to even be speculating about 2012!!

Repubs LOVE governors.  And people LOVE Palin.  She's so sexy, and in today's "pop culture" style of elections, she's perfect.    Mr. B. Hussein Obama is the first "pop culture" president, he's ushering the era in which personality and presentation is more important than policy or experience, of which Mr. B Hussein Obama has none.    It's hers if she wants it.  And I've recently heard her give a speech that sounded awfully Reagan-esque in its content.|`|hmNY4gQtaa	she or the GOP arent worth s/$%?&!/$%!"/$%?!!|`|gmaCvh00aa	I don't think she'll swing the vote far enough over their way.  I know a lot of people in some parts of the country were taken with the silly folksy speech affectations like Gosh and You Betcha, but in more urban areas that stuff just makes intelligent people recoil in horror.    We once had a training class at work led by this guy from Texas, and all throughout he kept using this corny stupid term, "Hot Dog!"  Every other sentence, "Hot Dog"!  And he prounounced "dog" like "dahg" which somehow made it worse, lol.    People all cut out early.  We couldn't stand to listen to him anymore.  I get that same reaction when I listen to Sarah Palin speak.  I'm sure she must have done something to make it all the way to governor, even if it's only Alaska--it's still one of the fifty states, but she can't speak like that to normal people in the more developed parts of the country and expect to be accepted.|`|42a808600b09bd222d75e11f7e961238aa	I think its way too early to tell about Sarah. She needs to bone up on America before she attempts to run again. The microcosm which is Alaska does not represent the other States and her lack of knowledge on hot spots in the US hurt her image in the recent race.

People are now realizing that the use of the word "anti-semitic" can not stop them from stating the evils of Zionism.    You are right, US congress is very pro-Israel. And many of them, like Rahm Emanuel, have dual citizenships and loyalties. Emanuel served in IDF during the Gulf war. How can he still be an American citizen? How can he hold such a high position in our government?|`|2932956ec7662d7544675f368775f540aa	No, nor has it awakened them to the monstrous threat of Islam to the entire free world.

Does it not factor into your math that they would have killed hundreds of millions of Americans if they could have? They declared war on America and had no intentions of stopping unless they were stopped.    You have forgotten US soldiers killed while fighting them and allies killed so why don't you change your scoreboard around and also figure out a way to quantify brutal rape and slavery as well.     Have you ever seen the aftermath of the fire-bombings of Germany? Why is one issue separated from another?    You say the "American government" but what you are describing is government itself. You talk of Japan and then leave out their government of the time?    I would suggest reading some books on philosophy, study universal concepts, and then look into some pre-American history and what is going on in other countries, so you can get the obvious training your mind has been undergoing, out. Otherwise, you won't see the real world, because that world does not exist through an "anti-American" lens.

7eafc0239f647b182cf2120c7ed5df99aa	I assume you are attempting to remedy the situation.  I am not sure the State you are located.  However, every State has a nursing home statute that provides "Residents' Rights" to nursing home patients.  The actual statute can usually be accessed by going to the State's website and searching the statutes.  In Florida the controlling statute is Chapter 400.  In addition, your State has an ombudsman office that is charged with investigating any complaints by residents, their family or friends.  Your State should have a department of elderly affairs.  Contact the ombudsman and make a formal complaint.  The ombudsman will then interview the resident, the administrator at the facility, yourself and any other family member involved in the resident's care.  If the resident has a court appointed surrogate, that person has a right to review the resident's medical chart and to have reasonable access to the resident.  If you still believe the resident is being unfairly held, contact an attorney in your area to discuss the issues.|`|AA10268547	I have heard of myths, but they can't stop the legal guardian of a person ( if there is one) from the patient.<br>  <br>  As a matter of fact, any nursing home in our area, I can walk into and go see any patient in thier building, so honestly I don't believe the stories,|`|32edf6bbc923ed62b18ed8d31e83a082aa	Sure, I've heard of several that this is happening in.  Some nursing homes are nothing short of a scam business.  Some have even been on the news.|`|030a601da9e461882457798bb4ecd43eaa	Personally I have heard of this. Usually I have seen that the nursing home usually wants family to come in, but sure doesn't expect them to. <br>  <br>  I don't doubt that it could be happening however, and if that's the case, I reccomend moving your family member out of that nursing home, and into one that will actually care for that beloved mamber of your family.

AXoAMEY5aa	What do I think?  Just asking that question presupposes that we are not sheeple following Obama over a cliff.    Real answer: Keynesian economics my friend.  Ya gotta build worthless pyramids to lower unemployment.  Or so Johnny M. K. thought.  It's this idea of "spend spend spend, debt is good" which was actually instituted under the New Deal.  Here's some data to consider.  When FDR got into office and started the new deal, unemployment was about 25%.  Guess what it was up until WW2?  25%.  Government spending, programs, welfare did nothing.  WW2 dropped the unemployment rate because all the unemployed went to war for work and food.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	So where were you the past 8 years when they were spending like drunken sailors on leave?

Bush's 2001 tax cuts: "the weakest employment growth in decades.":    2003: resulting in job creation that was "well below historical averages."    only 2.6 million more jobs than in June 2003 created rather than the HYPED 5.5 million new jobs:  http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2...    The average annual employment growth was 2.5 percent after 1993 and just 0.6 percent after 2001.  http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2...    As has been extensively documented, the most effective way to close the GDP gap and lay a foundation for long run growth is by getting money into the hands of people who are most likely to spend it (struggling families), helping to shore up state budgets to prevent service cuts and property tax hikes, and through direct investment by the federal government. What we dont need is simply more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy.  http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8932/...  http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/test...  http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01...  http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/wp-con...|`|ofP7bbX7aa	He told you he would spread the wealth.

And is that really a quote?  "Stimulus" is spelled wrong, and it doesn't make sense grammatically.  I don't know who would take that seriously.  If you're going to quote something, you have to get it right.        Does the stimulus package really include $300,000 for a sculpture garden? NO  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/...

NO $25,000,000 for an anti-smoking campaign  NO $50,000,000 arts school:  "$50,000,000, to be distributed in direct grants to fund arts projects and activities which preserve jobs in the non-profit arts sector threatened by declines in philanthropic and other support during the current economic downturn" that's 50 million in TOTAL for arts    Have you even seen the bill?  Where do you get your facts?|`|gdYN39gtaa	It gives Democrats an approved law so they can spend     more than they take in during the following upcoming years.     80% pork, and 12% economy stimulus.

Just don't say "he passed it."|`|kT7GCNnCaa	Politicians seem to have something else in mind rather than making smart educated choices.

One trick of the media is to generally say things without having to give specifics. Bad news reporting. Sources should be sited in a "news" article.

Three out of the last five Illinois Governors have gone to the Federal Pen! When will they learn that the FBI has very good wiretaps all over the Illinois Governor's Mansion.  If they had such good surveillance on all politicians, we might do away with corruption in government.|`|OlcC4hwcaa	he didn't actually do anything that most politicians do. look at all the idiots bush gave jobs to that helped him get in. he didn't brag to doing this under fbi wiretap, he just did it. this is why our country is so messed up, incompetent people were in charge. obama is changing this by putting the best he can find from all parties to run government. did bush have any democrats in top positions|`|jSBtdhf0aa	the man is insane.
DAMZKbpDaa	Alcohol consumption probably went up  about 25% after the end of prohibition (while there aren't any direct records, this is an estimate based on the rise and fall of liver disease, with is strongly related to alcohol consumption).    There is probably no way to directly track how much drug use will rise if a particular drug is made legal, but I don't think anyone will think it will DECLINE.     The argument is that by decriminalizing drugs, it will end the black market, and take pressure off police enforcement. There is no hint that this would be the case, but that is the argument. Or at least that is the way I see it.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	legalizing will not prevent abuse. Cigarettes, opiates, alcohol, and inhalants are all legal and people abuse them everyday. Unfortunately, people are going to find a way to abuse anything that gives them a high  and legalization isn't going to stop it.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Legalizing something doesn't prevent it from happening. It doesn't even really make it safer. People still die from cirrhosis of the liver brought on by alcoholism. People will still die from bad drugs, drug overdoses, etc. It's a stupid mindset, really... "they're gonna do it anyways so why not legalize it?" It doesn't solve *any* problems except legal ones; now people don't have to be fined or jailed for doing X or Y because it is legal. It's still risky behaviour; legality doesn't change that.|`|55nophEPaa	alcohol prohibition was removed by popular demand and because all the violence. drugs are still illegal because the government makes an @ $% load of money off it|`|30ad4662919fe0039d27aaea1639ebe5aa	Alcohol  Is A dangerous drug. Few people realize that. Many states have laws which make the second DWI A serious offense punishable by prison.. Common sense ,responsibility needs to be taught from  birth on.  Few people are aware of that.  A child needs to learn to pick up after himself .  This is Not being cruel ! It is teaching someone survival tools early !   I have 2 grand children whose mother is a counseler. It is a trip worth taking ,trust me. They are great kids|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	Train up a child in the way he should go......     O.K., realistically, that will take care of about 2% of the population.  For the other 98%, we need laws and law enforcement.    Alcohol and cigarettes will never be illegal, but not because they are safe or can be used safely - because they are too entrenched in our society.  That's why prohibition didn't work.    We should NEVER legalize any of the currently illegal recreational drugs.  They are bad for society and will lead to more problems.|`|lnnv29dzaa	They just need to come out with a responsibility license. Responsible people have it and they can purchase and do things stupid people can't so not everyone has to be treated like a child.|`|sKmpJY85aa	If we legalized & taxed some drugs heavily (like we do alcohol) it would shut a LOT of drug-traffickers in Mexico down completely..|`|cx4kGsN0aa	No one says that legalizing them prevents people from abusing them,   The abusers will abuse them whether or not they're legal.  Legalizing drugs will simply make the whole thing a bit less shady.  For instance... You can get drugs from a drug store rather than from a violent criminal.     During alcohol prohibition, the sale of alcohol was controlled largely by gangs and violent ruthless individuals (sound familiar).  Here's a quote from a former supporter:    "When Prohibition was introduced, I hoped that it would be widely supported by public opinion and the day would soon come when the evil effects of alcohol would be recognized. I have slowly and reluctantly come to believe that this has not been the result. Instead, drinking has generally increased; the speakeasy has replaced the saloon; a vast army of lawbreakers has appeared; many of our best citizens have openly ignored Prohibition; respect for the law has been greatly lessened; and crime has increased to a level never seen before."    If you look at it, most crime that we have now is DRUG RELATED rather than alchohol related.  I don't like drugs either, but making it illegal, and making even the occasional marajuana user a criminal does nothing to help an addict, or even keep drugs of the streets for that matter. It just gets people shot.|`|vRS0o4Qhaa	It doesn't stop the abuse,   it decreases the crimes   associated with the profit  the criminals are making.

I wonder how many British people are working in Europe? In any case most of those protesting are Labour supporters so now their getting a sample of what the Labour Party has done for them. In any case most people will always take the cheapest quote for a job so what's wrong when employers do the same?|`|OFGE01tRaa	Hell Yes!|`|3mWDhNl3aa	You don't see many protests about foreign workers employed in care homes for the elderly, or working for farmers doing jobs that we don't want any more.  "British jobs for British workers" was just another piece of Brown's blather. While we're in the EU it would be illegal to discriminate against workers from other EU countries.  So no, we should just put up with it.  It's part of the price we pay for EU membership.|`|Aah86hEmaa	Of course we should.    At last a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel of apathy that is grinding our Nation into the ground.    Lets get the jobs back from China and the Far East, and bring prosperity back for all, not just the fortunate few.    The destiny of British industry is in the hands of British workers and consumers, buy only British, lets get the Nation back on its feet, lets succeed where the Government have failed miserably.

I do know that they are trying to get their own pork in there to help our state, which has just announced that thousands of essential state services and jobs are going to be cut again in 2009.  As it becomes more and more clear to even the most uninformed among us that Obama's bill is nothing but a gift basket for his campaign supporters it will lose support with the people, and so will the Congress and Obama.  The 2010 elections will be very interesting.  Where I live people are expecting that within the next six months the housing market will recover and rebound, the stock market will gain 13,000 points, better-paying jobs will be available to everyone, wages will increase and taxes will go down.

I use to be a republican a few years back, but they pretty much fully embraced the neocon, social conservative hybrid platform, while almost entirely abandoning their limited government, fiscally conservative views.    On the other hand, the democrats have embraced the far left fringe elements of their party, and the giant bureaucratic government, high taxation and spending model akin to Europe's Social Democracy, which is border line socialism.    Both parties suck, both are growing the government by leaps and bounds, both are selling out our sovereignty to transnational corporations, international organizations, and special interest groups, both are executing interventionist foreign policies policing the world, and both are full of elitists.

Four nations and competitive governments.|`|GJFBsG62aa	America would be a very odd country, actually what part would have been America?|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	That depends on which side of the Mason-Dixon line you're standing.    According to the folks in the North, the South never left the Union because they felt that secession was unconstitutional (which it wasn't at that time, by the way).  At first, Lincoln was fighting "to preserve the Union," but after getting his butt kicked but good for the first 18 months of the war, he needed to find something to quell the growing unrest at his war efforts at home and get the Northern people on his side.  He picked the abolition of slavery, an issue which he knew that 99% of the Northern people would get behind him on.  So he issued the Emacipation Proclamation, a non-binding, illegal document, and his trick worked - the people of the North eagerly supported a war to free the slaves.    Accoding to the folks in the South, the Southern states did in fact leave the Union the moment their individual states passed their Articles of Secession.  From the start, the Confederate war effort was to break away from the Union and form their own nation, free of what they felt was the oppressive rule of Washington, DC and a President that they felt was bent on ruining their way of life - which, by the way, centered around cotton, which was picked by slaves.  Get rid of the slaves and you lose your labor force; lose your labor force and you lose your cotton crop; lose your cotton crop and you're broke and destitute.    So for all of those folks out there who are decrying my answer about the legality of secession and all that, lemme ask ya a question:  if secession was unconstitutional and the Southern states never left the Union because of this reason, then why were ALL of the Southern states required to be "re-admitted" to the Union during Reconstruction?  How can you be "re-admitted" to something that you never left?|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	If it would have avoided the civil  war, I would  have let them leave, but if you look at the grievances of the south  it is clear that secession would not have solved the problems so sooner of later we would have had one or more wars anyway.|`|Uaci5YXWaa	Who knows!  It would be a different world if he hadn't.      President Buchanan asked the Attorney General to research whether states had a constitutional right to succeed and he reported that they did.  But when they seized the New Orleans Mint and fired on Fort Sumter, Lincoln declared constitutional rights suspended because a state of insurrection existed (there is precedent in George Washingtons suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion).      It has been postulated that as the same Supreme Court had handed down the Dred Scott Decision, had the Southern States sued for possession of the Mint and the Fort, instead of seizing them, the Supreme Court would have ruled in their favor and also enjoined the Federal Army from attacking them.    Who knows what would have happened if the Rule of Law had replaced partisan brinksmanship in 1860 America.  The Confederate States of America would be a separate country, but slavery would not have lasted long in any event.  England and even Russia had already freed its slaves and in the 19th century it was becoming cheaper to employ workers for pennies than to own them and have to care for them for life.|`|AA10222422	Yes!  United we stand, divided we fall. If the South had left the Union we would never have become one of the worlds leading countries.  I spent much of my life in the South, I know how they treated the Blacks & if they were able to do so, would still be treating them just as badly. It's not been that long ago that they hung a young black for speaking to a White girl!  We as a nation need the South now as much as we needed it back in the 1860's.  I was born in the South but, I'm darn proud to be living in a United America!

People are becoming unemployed, which means they cannot buy goods. When people can't buy goods, there is no demand for supply, and prices are slashed.

They are highly trained warriors. only if their missions goes wrong is their any chance of death.  i am sure for every war, maybe ten Seals die. probably less.    except for afghanistan now. some 17 or 20 Seals all dies in one day, do to heavy fire on a rescue mission for some more Seals.  but like i said, they are trained not to die.  and they are good at it.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Very low.   General Horner, the head of the AF in the gulf war, dedicated his autobiography to the 99 special forces members killed from 1990-2000.

e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	You probably already know my answer Martin. The federal government should be cut by about 70% and returned to it's constitutional roles of monetary policy, foreign policy, immigration, Indian and Tribal Affairs, and defense.    The war in Iraq should end, since we have no right to intervene in another sovereign nations activities if they do not directly threaten us, nor is it the duty of the US taxpayers to build their country.    Nearly all of the executive departments should be shut down: Health and human services, housing and urban development, energy, labor, commerce, education, etc. Leaving only the State department, the treasury, and Department of Justice. For all issues the other departments manage are explicitly left to the individual states to administer according to the 10th amendment.    Repeal the 16th amendment to abolish federal income taxes, and thus shut down the IRS.    And finally, get rid of the Federal Reserve.    State governments, now that is an entirely different issue, since each state has their own constitutions and laws. Just so long as those state laws don't conflict with the US Constitution.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	What Stan Darsh said.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Quit providing for illegal immigrants and their 5 plus children!!!!!|`|AA11398340	The size of the "government" footprint s/b much smaller, I believe that it has grown to the point it has because of TOOOOO much intervention|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Stop helping dying business failures.

Bush (& the Dems) messed up the economy so people elected Obama.  The economy surely won't be recovered by 2010 so we will have a lot of Rebpulicans win.  But if the economy is on an upswing by 2012.

The media ate him up and found a perfect enemy in Palin.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	The only reason Republicans lose, because these modern Republicans do not act like a proper Republicans.    I can identify myself with a lot of Conservatives social values. I don't want people to shove gay and lesbian freak show in my face or alter english word to their likings.  What they do is up to them but I don't want them shoving it to my face.    Many Republicans that are still have brain on their own actually chose to not show up to vote during 2006 and 2008 election.  I have many friends, especially from the church that refused to go and vote, they don't vote for democrats but they just don't go to vote at all. They felt betrayed, they voted for George W. Bush on a show that he was a man of God, pitched on high sales by Evangelical leader Ted Haggard and big name like Dobson.  And then the reality start to struck.    1) George W. Bush premise on his campaign was being contradicted by his own actions,   From not wanting to police the world to leading America largest invasion and nation building project.  From promise of clean government to Actions that show war profiteering in nature and cabinets that were full of lobbyist.    2) All the religious leaders that help promotes him start to fall from their high horses one after another, each with more heinous acts that do not suit their titles. (most of them are opportunists using MY religion to gain money and power)  From Ted Haggard scandals that ruin a lot of support from that particular segment of society, to the fact that even George W. Bush's spiritual advisor (the person that preside of his daughter's wedding) Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell defended Obama from Dobson's smear campaign.    3) Bush administration promised to overturn a lot of liberal policies like Roe V Wade and gay marriage things. But those with brain can see that the Republicans like to keep the debate alive to rile up their supporters, Bush reign was complete the first 6 years, Republican had both the Houses and even the majority of Supreme Court once Sandra Day Connor resigned and replaced by a Republican nominee.  Yet he didn't put the nail in the issue, but just push for his tax cut for the rich.    4) Myriads of bribery and scandals within Republican politicians rank. Even when medias try to cover it up, the stinks just too high. Randy Duke Cunningham $2 million bribe, Tom Delay money laundering conviction, Newt Gingrich admittance that he was involved in extra-marital sex affair while leading a witch hunt for Bill Clinton's Lewinsky scandal to other scandals like the giant no bid contract Haliburton (used to be owned by Dick Cheney) moved to Dubai while getting the biggest contract money from US government in history, in addition to those that the media manage to cover up like Cheney's drunk shooting.    5) Economy, when economy is so bad and people start to get squeezed, they start to want to find out the why and what's been happening.  Other than the brainwashed lemmings that take the hypocrite Limbaugh's and Bill O'Reilly of the world words as gospel, they can see that this unbridled, unregulated corporations are the source of the problem, accentuated by George W. Bush crazy spending on the unneccessary war.    Until the rise of another clean shaved Republican that can instill confident in people again. The same friends were excited about Mike Huckabee's nomination back then until all those scandals broke out again.  And until Obama really screw up (and I mean screw up not just some made up stuffs made by Druggie Limbaugh), we're about to see a Democrats in power and the kind of change that will happen.    I myself hope that they don't go overboard with their social things regarding gay and lesbian and all those abortion issue crap. But in general can only hope for the best.

Burn lots of gas, but impose their silly ideas on all of us without tapping their own supplies (don't you just hate how an oil rig ruins the view of my multi million dollar house built on oceans edge - which they expect subsidized insurance for) Need more power that is what our neighbor states are for, but aren't they silly wanting to charge us for helping maintain their power grid. That is why they have residents in their state. And those extra costs to produce our special fuel - why those nasty oil companies can just charge other people for that. And don't forget the water those other nasty states want to hoard for their citizens- we need it to irrigate the desert to grow crops. And don't forget all the migrant workers we need to harvest them- you mean we have to pay for their benifits also!!   No let us see - why does California have economic troubles?

I don't care what anybody says... You WILL NOT convince me that a digital TV or TV at all OR Broad Band cable is a necessity!  And if it is not an absolute necessity the government SHOULD NOT be providing to people when other citizens are going to end up paying for it.      Some people just have to face the fact that they can't have everything they WANT.  I want a Mercedes and I can't have it.  Should I cry and make Obama make someone else give me one?

Read Paul Krugman's letter to Obama in the Rolling Stone, it's a good article. We need to invest in our infrastructure to get people back to work, but we also need to create areas where our GDP can grow further, and steadily. We need to invest in high tech jobs and renewable energy, and that will take a major investment in technical education. Yeah I do like the stimulus plan, but I would prefer spending in other areas at times.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	And yet, no one else has a better idea.    I am sure that Obama will listen if you have the plan that will fix everything.  Until then, it is what it is.    Tax cuts?  For what reason?  Tax cuts are going to do nothing to stimulate the economy.  I am a small business owner, and what I will do is stash that money away because I don't know what will happen down the road.      Republicans don't understand that tax cuts are not the answer right now.  Why?  Because we are too far in.  Maybe if Bush would have given them two years ago, when the signs began of what we are in now. . .    Too little too late.  The motto of the GOP.|`|CBx6qHztaa	I think most know it's garbage.

OqVALZDAaa	get a job.
E9XL5x3Paa	Obama is working with them, but Pelosi is not.      And while the Republicans are just using that as an excuse, in some ways they are trying to tie Obama to Pelosi and then send both to the bottom of a proverbial river with cement shoes.    Which is quite a stupid move.  They have no real power right now.  Obama is trying to give them some, and they'd rather shoot themselves in the foot to take him down then have some influence.    Pelosi is dangerous to Obama.  If Republicans in Congress had sense, they'd side with Obama now; because at some point Obama is going to have to stop Pelosi.  But if the Republicans continue to try and take him down by tying him to Pelosi, then he will have to keep Pelosi afloat to keep himself up.  To do that, he'd have to be the one to send the Republicans to the bottom of the proverbial river with cement shoes.    If they work with Obama, they get some influence.  Fight Obama, and then Pelosi and Obama win together and Republicans go down.  It's easy to see what the situation is, and yet Republicans are still trying their hardest to take down Obama; which will end with them being the ones being screwed.      They NEED to side with Obama now, or they will screw themselves.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Burning bridges now could come back and haunt him later.   Setting a foundation of working with both parties now could make passing other legislation easier sometime down the line.|`|AA10690306	I know it is like they want to lose all credibility as a party now.

Does he have you thinking he's being bi-partisan? Yea? OK good.
DiDCG9UBaa	By appealing to the Republicans and having them vote against him, Obama has effectively weakened the party even further. They have been totally responsible for the Bush Depression and now refuse to acknowledge their failure and are actually trying to compound the situation. They are self-destructing and his meeting with them has only high lighted their incompetence. You are correct that most Americans realize where the current problems have come from (witness the previous election) but the Republicans have been faced with a choice: They could own up to their massive failure or they could scramble helplessly and hope that a majority of Americans would be too ignorant to see the obvious. They're banking on the latter and they will suffer for it.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Agreed. Republicans are digging their own grave but they are so far down in their ideological ruts that they can't see it. I think President Obama should continue acting nice and keep building the record against them.|`|rttm1SLaaa	I've been listening to various sources on this all day, and I understand your point of view very clearly.  I get the fact that Democrats should just make this an opportunity to get their views through, and I agree that they should put more actually liberal policies through with less concessions.    But there is a method behind the madness.  Think about it, Obama is building up the importance of doing something immediately, and the Republican response has been to say "not so fast."  He's making them look terrible in the public eye, but more importantly, he's removing their political capital.  When a Republican senator or congressman wants to pass something, they'll find it very difficult to do so.  They'll begin to realize that this is happening to them, and they'll either change (and there's a lot of people who could change), or they'll lose the 2010 election in a huge landslide again.  I like to think that some people will change their minds, and in doing so, the President is forcing bipartisanship, which is the only way it'll happen.|`|oVGOW3xPaa	Obama does not represent African Americans.

Obama and the democrats wanted a portion of the Republicans to sign on to the bill even thought they are not needed....why is that... very simple since this is a pork bill and not a stimulus package when it fails they will need the cover of bipartisanship of the Republicans to handle the blame . If the Republicans are smart they will let the democrats have this whole turkey so they can have at least a record to run against|`|1tNmUmE3aa	Oh brother...i hope you feel better now.|`|qCd4T4o5aa	Obama has a very unique spirit; He wants to bring everyone to the table and break bread.

He will just have to press on and get the democrats to pass as much as they can as fast as they can.

The stimulus bill, ( key word, BILL!) will not work.  You don't spend your way out of debt, it doesn't work, never has.  Obama's stimulus bill is pork barrel spending at its worst.  Can't blame Bush on this one.  Obama wants the Republicans on so he can have "common ground."      Dissent is good, especially if it's a bad idea to pass a law or bill.  The Republicans see a disaster on the way if this bill passes.  Democrats are too full of Obamagasms to look at the stimulus bill objectively.    "If Obama wants it, it must be good."|`|AA11248279	Why else?  Pelosi has spouted for the last 2 weeks that she no longer needs any Republican votes.

If they cannot oppose it they will smile politely for the cameras while festering with rage.|`|Wcjc8Au1aa	I think he's trying to get Republicans on board for several reasons:  I think he was sincerely repelled by the knee-jerk partisanship that controlled almost everything in Congress when he was there.  I think he believes that almost any economic recovery policies will be more successful if the entire country is behind them.  That would restore confidence, which is a major requirement for economic recovery.  Also, I think he wants to put Republicans in a political box.  Right now he's very popular, and if Republicans oppose him monolithically as they did in the House of Representatives on the stimulus bill, they'll look like partisan obstructionists.    Obviously he's NOT trying to get the Republicans to share the blame when the plan doesn't work, because he believes it WILL work.  If he didn't believe that, he'd propose a different plan!|`|8276fe09a930406f0fa15c60ea31aea8aa	No.  He's actually trying to be bi-partisan - something our previous administration could not understand.

Right now the country seems filled with young punks and old geezer curmudgeons who have a lot in common; the punk hasn't chosen to learn anything and the curmudgeon has selectively chosen to forget most of what he has learned. You may not actually be a punk or a geezer but just acting like one of them.   You seem to want the two parties to perform like two ghetto gangs fighting over drug distribution rights.  If you believe that the other team should never lead and that yours should always lead, then you don't believe in democracy or majority rule at all; you simply want a dictatorship.

FDR's Treasury secretary was right!    Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau, angry at the Keynesian spenders, confided to his diary May 1939: "We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. And I have just one interest, and now if I am wrong somebody else can have my job. I want to see this country prosper. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises. I say after eight years of this administration, we have just as much unemployment as when we started.[43] And enormous debt to boot."|`|eulMjLtPaa	No, that was Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau in 1939.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Yes it does. Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.|`|AA11598520	I don't know if he actually said it, but that's the way it happened. Only Pearl Harbor and our entrance into the Second World War got us out of it. Of course, these days, we can be attacked, but no one seems to want to fight back, so that wouldn't help us either.
Ry61ViNZaa	Under the law, yes.  But men and women and the roles they play in relationships and society are becoming diluted and that is destroying the family unit.    When you have a competition between the sexes it inevitably destroys relationships and the family.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a "women should be barefoot and pregnant" type.  I just think that when you start to destroy all traditional male and female rolls in society, that society erodes.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, because discrimination is un constitutional and by excluding women the nation would lose a great deal of talent.|`|VkFWgXaHaa	i think women should stay only in the kitchen and make men sandwiches!  only thing they are good for besides making drama....so MAKE ME A MANASE SANDWICH biwatch!|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Yes.|`|aBqJhdufaa	No, like there's a few cases that it really wouldn't make sense.

LIke if a guy got raped or abused, no big deal.. on the other hand, if it's to a girl who is abused, then it's taken more seriously..|`|3WLec6lsaa	Of course, we are all equal. It is like saying should Asians be treated differently, or African Americans? Sure, we have our differences, I admit that. However, I believe that these differences are/were a result of centuries of treating women and men separately. It is similar to why a lot of African Americans are stuck on the streets . . . they have been denied opportunities. They are being racially profiled now because, statistically, they have a higher crime rate; however, this only exacerbates the problem. If police profiled whites and blacks equally, I am certain the 'crime rate' of African Americans will go down. Similarly, if we treated women equally, women wouldn't feel so oppressed and could do great things.      EDIT:  Quote:     "Under the LAW yes.    Men and women ARE different and that's just a FACT.  One is not better than the other. They are different.  If I'm in a burning building and need to get carried out...I want a man.  If I'm getting my nails done and a massage...I want a woman doing it.  It's just a PREFERENCE...not sexist."      You preface your answer with 'under the law'. So, they are legally responsible for their actions, and yet cannot do things that the opposite sex can do? They have responsibilities but are denied rights? Anyway, are you telling me that it is wrong for me, as a male, to want to be a cosmetologist? What if that is my passion? What if I can do your nails as good as any other female? Furthermore, there have been female snipers in the army that have claimed more than 300 personal kills. There are women that will fight harder and with more intensity than males. Don't trust them in the army? Don't think they'd be able to be unified? That was the argument used to keep blacks from the army.      "I don't think a woman would work real well on a pro football team. Do you?"    So should a person that is 5'5. But there have been great football players that, desptite their hight, have overcome the odds. The film Rudy comes to mind.     Anyway, you must also say that black people are different, no? Should they be treated differently?|`|lHiPygmqaa	What are you saying...?    All is one and one is all.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	No. I am not politically correct, nor am I a sexist.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	No... we are very different.  I wouldn't want my 270 pound body trapped and unconscious on the seventh floor of a smoked filed building during a fire, and have a woman be the fireMAN that is there to resuce me by carrying me down the seven floors....    But. I would want a woman to be the waitress at hooters that brings me my wings....    Get over yourself.. we ARE different... I can't breastfeed, and won't demand the right to do it.|`|m3jb9qjdaa	No, I don't think they should be treated differently.    However, I have some concern in this way.....I work in a group of 5 people, we all do the same job. We don't get paid the same though because some have more experience, some do a better job and have gotten better raises over time, some have been on the job longer than others......so we get paid differently for those reasons. We don't know how much each other gets paid, it's not professional to share such information. Since we are all male, I don't suppose I could sue if I found out one of the guys makes more than me for the same job could I. But if I was female, you think I should then be able to sue?    I hope you have to employ people one of these days and then you can see how silly this can become. I do see that there could be some instances where there is discrimination, and I think the laws are already there for that. But in my example above...I could sue if I was female, but not if I was male. So are we treated the same?|`|qgL98Wv2aa	many women would say yes but your question should be are women also willing to allow men to have the same rights as they do too        LET'S RODEO SAN ANTONIO YEEEEE..HAAAAAA|`|vVTmJjJDaa	no - and it doesn't make me a sexist; it makes me a female....as currently, under the law of the USA, all males are required to register for the service - and, as of yet, females are not - and, i'm quite in agreement with that....as in general, males are much stronger and faster than females...    although, if a woman *wants* to sign up, more power to her - however, i just don't think it's even remotely justified to expect a female to be able to adequately carry gear, and defend herself properly under most circumstances...much less, santa forbid, be treated the same as a male if she becomes a prisoner of war.    EDIT:  would you want your *Mom*, your *Sister*, your *Girlfriend*, your *Wife* or your *Daughter* being forced to fight in combat??  didn't think so.|`|3ME7sBxjaa	I'm definately for women fighting in combat.  It's only fair.  And combat is mostly with guns anyway.  How much hand-to-hand has gone on in Iraq?    You're right about the rape thing too.  Our soldiers were perfectly happy to molest the male Iraqis in Abu Ghraib.    There is pretty much no reason for the law to treat someone different based on gender.  --  Vincent: Men have those rights too.  Believe it or not there is such a thing as "paternity leave".  Also, men get raped too!|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	The law is not a tablet handed down from heaven.  It is the will of a majority of politicians of a particular political stripe at any particular point in time. That will, or opposition to it, can be reinforced or undermined by appointments to the Supreme Court - also determined by politicians of their political stripe.  Women's status in law was undoubtedly fashioned by militant Feminists. (Many of whom, being lesbians,were in a position to "out" gay male politicians when being gay was even more toxic than it is today. They had the power of blackmailers.) Those Feminists never thought in terms of equality. Detesting men as they did, they went for superiority. Being clever, as they were, they invented the concept of "political correctness" which put any objecting male into the stocks of a "neanderthal sexist."  Quite brilliant, really.  But one thing that the Feminists forgot was that women have mothers and sisters and female friends whom they know to be capable of evil. Similarly, they have fathers, husbands, brothers and male friends whom they know to be capable of kindness.  The hate-driven agenda of Feminists has taken a surprisingly long time to crumble, but crumbling it is, and ironically it will reach a state of equilibrium in equality.  Just today, in Quebec, a woman was sentenced to 20 years for strangling her 12 year old daughter to death because her boyfriend asked her to choose between the daughter and him. True, a father would have got 25 years, but not long ago the woman would have been put on probabation and given the "help" that she needed. So justice is starting to win out.|`|NGIhehsEaa	Yeah|`|brVj9ktDaa	no, because a woman shouldnt be allowed to fight in combat, and a man shouldnt be able to go to the gynecologist, that is not sexist|`|YPVLgV3baa	yepp.i do gree,I hate how some people are all sexist..its gay,girls should be treated exactly the same|`|5b088cb7c4af933e75b03012c37f940daa	Yes, and in my opinion that includes things like compulsory registration with the selective service.|`|RtHq6y78aa	Under the LAW yes.    Men and women ARE different and that's just a FACT.  One is not better than the other.  They are different.  If I'm in a burning building and need to get carried out...I want a man.  If I'm getting my nails done and a massage...I want a woman doing it.    It's just a PREFERENCE...not sexist.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	There is no reason I can think of that women and men should be treated differently.    Regardless of our genitals we are still people - all people should be treated the same under the law.  That includes the rich and powerful - though they seem to have a different set of rules to the rest of us.    EDIT:  Are people actually reading this question.  I think many of you have missed the "UNDER THE LAW" part.  Rape and abuse happens to men as well as women, and it is a big deal!  They deserve the same protections as women in this situation.    Men have rights to paternity leave (they can't have maternity leave obviously) - but they still have, and should have, the same rights as the mother to time off for the birth of a child.  No-one asked who you would want to rescue you from a fire (and I wouldn't care if it was a women if she got me out).    The law should treat everyone the same.  Of course there are differences between men and women but that's not the question asked.|`|nAwLPHHNaa	YES.. we should all be treated the same!|`|HmOdSP5Waa	I don't think a woman would work real well on a pro football team. Do you?|`|fN3aXySWaa	That's not true. Women need special protections, for things like maternity leave and the option to deliver recorded testimony in a rape trial instead of facing their attacker. The question is not as simple as it seems.|`|pMwxJNicaa	I agree, but not just as a law, but as a generally moral thing too. We are no different than men. The current sexism is a mix between our own image of ourselves, and what men want us to be. I think that if both of these images went away, it would be more possible to be truly equal.|`|PJBYzIq6aa	Yeah, but im against that women have more rights than men now...That's sexist!

Ry61ViNZaa	I am a Traditionalist Conservative and here is what I believe:    America is the greatest country in the world.  It gives you every opportunity to do just about whatever you are willing to work for.  Few other places in the world give you the opportunity to succeed or for that matter fail beyond your wildest dreams.  Nowhere else can a poor kid work hard and make the right decisions and one day be wealthy.  Nowhere else can someone legally immigrate and with hard work and determination later live the American dream!    It is all there for the taking.  Education and opportunity are abundant for those that wish to take advantage of this great land.    But, sadly, the entitlement mentality and class envy that have been instilled into everyone over the last 45 years are destroying us.  Practically gone are the days of working hard for 20, 30 or more years so that you can achieve your goal.  Work and personal responsibility are not praised the way they once were.  Many are now rewarded for their great and continued failures in life.  People have more kids than they can or want to afford and just stand around with their hand out for government assistance.    Why do high school or college grads now EXPECT that right out of school they deserve the finest home, the nicest car and plenty of disposable cash?  Why do they frown upon hard work and sacrifice to later reap from what they earned?  Because society has told them they are entitled to greatness and if they do not get it immediately then its just plain Not Fair.    Take control of your own life.  Do not look for the government to support you.  Thank this country every day for all of the opportunity it affords you, people!|`|3yXhtBSxaa	I'm a Republican, and there are many Republican politicians I find fault with for a number of reasons.  I never liked George Bush, don't agree with him on many issues.  I refused to vote for him both times.  I didn't vote at all those election years.    I don't mix it up as some people do.  What I mean by that is people often say they vote for the person, not the party, meaning they vote for both Democrats and Republicans.  I vote for the person, not the party as well.  But I only vote Republican.  If there is a Republican candidate I don't like, I simply don't vote.    I'm not going to vote for a Democrat because I know the Democratic Party platform, and I don't agree with it.  Why would I vote for a person who subscribes to the ideals outlined in a platform I don't agree with?|`|EPqnB7Epaa	I'll only say this, most Conservatives I know have no problem taking Bush and the Republican party to task for their excessive spending over the last eight years.  At the same time, I find that most Democrats I know will not admit that Democrat politicians were with them every step of the way.  The very fact that we don't see liberals shouting down Obama for the recent missile strikes in Pakistan which killed civilians tells me quite a bit.|`|0wHdmGszaa	Have you considered the possibility that the political party does not necessarily reflect on the intentions of the politician?|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	More informed veiw|`|3fcc8a67fc109dc6d5e33948cbbf4447aa	well let's face it, most republicans can say Bush screwed up  They might not say he is the anti-christ or hitler but I believe most can say that yeh he didn't make the best choices I think you would be much harder pressed to find a dem say anyting bad about Obama.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Exactly and they need to start with Nancy Pelosi.

How about this, when someone uses a gun in the commission of a crime (any crime loaded or not) they go to prison for 10 years. If we have to send them to the desert to tent city then be it. That is how you control crime. Not by taking citizens guns away|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	No! If you take guns away from the law abiding citizens then the only ones who will have them are the criminals and the police ( they are pretty much the same thing now days.) The only thing that is going to stop most of the things going on today is education about fire arms! When I was growing up we did have violence in schools but we handled it after school with our fists for the most part. That is the way it was when my parents and grand parents were in school. Ask the parents and grand parents if these kinds of things happened when they were in school and they will tell you no it did not. The earlier generations were more educated about firearms and were taught to respect them not fear them! When I was in school I was more afraid of what my parents were going to do to me if I screwed up then what the school or police were going to do to me! The government has taken that fear away from the children now they will just call C.P.S. if you spank them! This country has become soft and its only going to get worse! Its not video games, T.V., or movies that are causing the violence! Its lack of parental responsibility. Its easier to blame something else for their lack of parenting skills! If the parents of the columbine murderers would have had more involvement with their children then they would have known something was wrong! It is not the job of the public school system to raise children only to educate them it is a parents job to raise them and to teach the right from wrong and the other important things in life! Everyone now days just wants to place the blame on something or someone  else so that they do not have to take the blame themselves!    As a parent it is your responsibility to teach your kids what is right, what is wrong, what is real, what is fake, what is acceptable, and what is not. It is not society's job to do it for you! Parents are getting less and less involved in childrens life! It is very, very sad and disturbing!|`|Rlvo5P9maa	No. Gun control would just control the responsible gun user, not the criminal, since criminals don't seem to have a problem with getting their hands on illegal items.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	to me gun control is ALWAYS hitting your target|`|mY4m47WTaa	The Columbine kids killed because they were psychopaths, not because they were bullied.|`|b152183a660c2dbd3a470965bcb67686aa	Yes it does!    Guns are so readily available that anyone can get one and blast a few people to bits.    It used to be that people would settle things with their fists.    Now guns are so easy to get that everyone settles things that way...|`|AA10317675	Depends on the kind of gun control     The VTech killlings were by a man who bought his gusn shortly before the killings.  And if there wasn't a loophole in laws preventing the mentally ill from having guns, then he might not have had those guns that day.    But "gun free zones" are BS.  Keeping guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens in no way protects the public.  If there were some people licensed to carry a gun on campas that day, then fewer maybe Cho would have been taken out before so many people were killed.|`|m8f7rnBEaa	No.  Most guns used in crimes are illegal.|`|JQwL50JMaa	No way.  The problem is law-abiding citizens are being restricted while criminals, who don't give a damn about the laws, are out with their guns shooting people and wreaking havoc.    We good people have been made defenseless.  If we were allowed to use something we are registered to have, then the problem of crime would go down quite a bit.  Cons think they can get away with harassing an unarmed person.  But they might think twice if someone dug out a weapon at them to defend themselves.|`|AIkmlvu9aa	Yes, the vast majority of criminals follow the law, so we need more gun control.    You see, to a liberal, criminals are all innocent law abiding people until PROVEN guilty     Thus, all the gun crime is caused by law abiding criminals    (Gosh liberals are sure stupid almost makes your brain hurt to follow their logic)|`|c8672da7ef4d6901656bd2ee445c88a0aa	Criminals dont kill with guns registered under their own name.

During the Second World War, he served as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, with responsibility for planning and supervising the successful invasion of France and Germany in 194445. In 1951, he became the first supreme commander of NATO.[1]    As President, he oversaw the cease-fire of the Korean War, kept up the pressure on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, made nuclear weapons a higher defense priority, launched the Space Race, enlarged the Social Security program, and began the Interstate Highway System. Eisenhower also was highly involved in the 1953 Iranian coup d'tat, the overthrow of Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mossadegh and replacing him with the pro-Western Shah. He has been consistently ranked by scholars as one of the greatest U.S. Presidents.|`|JpYasw5iaa	I know that this is not the answer you are looking for, but here is something a lot (?) of people may not know:    When President Eisenhower was asked what was the most defining moment of his life, his ANTICIPATED answer was expected to bethe ordering of the troops to go in at Normandy on D-day in June 1944.    Much to the surprise of the "asker", the president stated that his most defining moment in his life was the death of his first born child (Doud Dwight Eisenhower) who died at the age of around 3.

He was elected because of the lousy job Truman did and because Truman fired the most popular General in American history. That and Ikes ability to get the allied commanders to agree during the war in Europe made a name for him as a man who could get the job done. It was only after he was elected that people saw him as someone who without his staff, had very little to offer..|`|AA10331255	The voters thought so.  He was twice elected.  The voters were right.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	I not here then - Kenya|`|fRcfn30Kaa	he was good in the sack, or Thomas SR says so|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	Like George Washington he won his Presidency as a military leader. Like George Washington, his performance as President was judged, or not, in light of his performance as an ex-military leader. I am one of many people who think that 50's America was as good as it ever got- before or since. It might well have been way that despite Ike, but we never really know how much any President  contributes or detracts from national well-being. So much depends upon a talented cabinet and world events.  But for 9/11, George W. Bush would have been a one-term President as ineffectual as Ford or Carter. What was he doing on the morning of 9/11? Reading a story to a class of school-kids.  But for 9/11, that kind of folksiness might have been all he was known for.

The complexity of the global market place is not easily understood. The micro essence of the US in such a diverse market , shows in the individual effort to supply the necessities of life (food , clothing & shelter). Most other endeavors are habits formed to alleviate the boredom or to find new worlds with the resources our ever growing population requires!The small businesses  are ultra micro in this market and become less viable the further they get from the basic requirements of life. Big business has done extremely well in their fulfilling of these basics, to the point that the small farmer/hunter,hide& cloth & shelter providers are swept to the fringe with little to do! Now the big doesn't want to share or sell or even allow the fringe any benefit for their co-operation.Even though the diligent small are the money behind the big and they can't stand it!

Basically to develop new industries that could lead to alternative fuels and power sources. The only problem with this is that now our Federal Taxes are gong to Bail Out Large BANKS, which allows these corporations to sit on interest building accounts while they streamline their corporations but cutting payroll taxes in a large way.With over 400,000 lay offs, the economy will suffer. The new jobs are in fields that are still 5 to ten years away from being a national power producing business. Solar power industry   has a growth market in regional locations. However not every section of this nation can utilize solar power energy. With changing demand in new alternative power sources, our Automobile industry, and the corporations that out source for them will have to change their ways in Management Approach, Science( mainly in the fields of design engineering, and Mechanical engineering.  New plants will be needed to rebuild infrastructure. The Quality of Thousands of Gas stations will close down and create even more chaos. But the ultimate goal is to industrialize our nations old habits of Fossil Fuel Dependency and change to newer fields of ENERGY development. Lets face it, Environmental Engineering Corporations are going benefit the most in these troubled times.     Now as for small business-Loans should not be used to bail out Small Businesses in this country: What should be implemented is a new gradual tax base relief Program for employers who can only pay with in the mini um wage area. A heavy tax break for small business owners who pay way too much in state and Federal taxes for employees should be given a tax break to alleviate the hardships.    Small business that meet a classification of true proprietorship's and not converted to LL. Should be given a heavy tax reduction to allow growth with in the small Business.     Small out sourced Corporations that specifically work with the Auto Industries should given a monetary tax relief at both the state and Federal levels to maintain employees.    Small owners business that are in the Food and Service fields should be given a tax gross profit margin relief. Before a business could only claim a loss seven years. If they can extend this to a longer period. This would allow business to flourish. Also a huge tax break in the local state areas on Liqour products to help profits. This should not be applied to the large makers. As their products never go out of waste in a nation bent of drinking as its primary source of personal Entertainmentfor their guest.|`|yIo9og80aa	I am a small business owner.

Large Taxpaying Corporations start out as small business.  Look at Google!   Here is my suggestions to solve this problem   1. Stop robbing the american people with excessive and abusive Federal taxes.    2. Stop wasteful spending and other sweet deals and favors.    2. Allow SBA Loans at 0.0% interest for 7 years both start up and existing.    3.Refinance all home loans owned  by US at the current rate money is lends to the Federal banks. (gives the money back to the people instead of the greedy Federal banks)     4.Give tax deductions to business so that they have the the ability to pay employees higher salaries.     5.Give tax deductions to businesses who hire new employees.  (Gives incentive to hire more employees and prevent layoffs)    6.Extra deductions for businesses that can keep employees.   (encourages employers the ability to keep employees happy)    7.

As for your suggestion - the current problem with the economy is that people are not spending money.  Nobody's buying anything but essentials.  Your solution is to start up a whole bunch of risky new businesses with no track record, no name recognition, no customer confidence in them - at a time when people aren't even buying from old, established businesses that they trust?  You think this makes sense?    In a normal economy, some 9 out of 10 small businesses go broke in the first year.  In this economy, it'll be more like 49 out of 50.

We are the richest country in the world by far, but our poor are getting poorer and the middle class is just treading water.  All the growth of the last 8 years has benefitted only the rich.

After you complete bootcamp, you will go to SOI just like all the other Infantry Marines, but once you graduate SOI, you will take thie Indoc, which consists of a PFT (you have to run over a 285), some crazy swim drills, then you must run another first class PFT.  If you pass this second PFT, you can go on to Recon Training.  The first day, something like 95 percent drop out, Recon is no joke.  Visiual requirements and such should be the same, you can always request to take the Indoc, and Recon is different in the sense that you are the best of the best, so you train harder than anyone else.  If you want to go recon, you should be training every day for it, it will be intense, but worth it.|`|XzStbSPnaa	They find you. The cream rises to the top. The recon people will  have heard of you and you will be interviewed by them. The more you enquire the worse your chances will be.|`|p21qJQ4Jaa	earning your title as a United States Marine is first priority!.....from there you will need to be in the 03xx field (infantry) and as long as your PFT score is high enough (needs to be a perfect 300) you will get screened for MARSOC at SOI. From there if you pass the screening you will get endoc tested, IF you pass that you will get attached to a unit and move up from there.

I am not.  Obama was my Senator.  I've met him.  I am not surprised that he just passed a bill to fund all of the programs the Democrats haven't been able to fund for 8 years and called it a stimulus package.  I agree with many of these programs.  I just always knew that he was a Politician and not a Rock Star, so I'm not disappointed in the least.  The Republicans already got their 'stimulus package' and gave money to their friends in the banking industry last month.

He knows the world is watching him.    I think it is sad that people are waiting for him to break so they can gloat.  He may make decisions and/or set policies that we may differ with; however, he must look at the bigger picture, not just bits and pieces of it, to achieve the best outcomes or results.

AA10691226	It's Hammurabi.     His code is misunderstood, especially the 'eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth' part.    It was intended to equalize society for punishments. Prior to Hammurabi, a person of high social standing could demand greater compensation from a lower level person, and a lower level person could only ask a little from a high level one.    For example, if a lower class individual ran over a rich man's foot with his cart wheel, he might be put to death. Conversely, if a rich man ran over a poor man's foot with his chariot, he might only have to pay a small fine.    The Code equalized this. For any offense which called for putting out an eye, any person, regardless of rank, would lose that eye. This caused the law to be more equitable and interestingly, for punishments in general to become less harsh.    Okay? ;-)|`|gqoIfbH0aa	The Law of Retaliation is ruled by the principle, "lex talionis" I.E. An eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth.    Theft was special, for theft the perpatrator was put to death.    This system was short and concise yet effective.    This system was used primarily to even out the playing ground for everyone legally, a rich man could easily deter justice from happening if charged or charging a poor man, they could demand pretty much anything, this code flattens everything out, making everyone equal legally standing.|`|LMuJMAqfaa	Can also be known as "eye for an eye"; the law of retaliation is a list of your penalty if you did something wrong to another person; usually you pay the exact thing that you did ... (Ex: you kill someone, they'll kill you ... hence, you destroy someone's eye, they'll destroy yours) ... However, in the case of a nobler person vs the peasant or vice versa, the law of retaliation favor the noblemen ... (Ex: the nobleman kill someone, he only have to pay a certain fee to the family) ...  You can get more from the wiki link below

Kaed3OE1aa	no, simply because if you let people have it they will abuse it, make it into a form of birth control because they were too lazy to use the many other ways to prevent pregnancy (condoms, pills, spermacides, ect)  abortions should be legalized for the following reasons: if the child is a threat to the mother's health, cause of rape/incest, and any other extenuating circumstances, NOT "i decided not to use a condom" or "the birth control didnt work" the people who had sex knew the risks but took them anyway, if something goes wrong and she gets pregnant, have the baby and give it up for adoption.|`|93r3nCM1aa	That depends...what is the alternative.    Is the alternative to keep going as we're going, restricting sex education, not providing adequate contraceptive, and then expecting every unwanted child to simply be placed in foster care to be adopted?    Because that's not going to work.    If people want abortion to be illegal, they need to be willing to make sacrifices...allow proper sex ed, increase funding for health clinics, and provide birth control. Otherwise we're still going to have the same problems with teen pregnancy...there will just be more babies being supported by the state.|`|PJBYzIq6aa	It's murder, so NO.

It is no longer a debate about facts, only belief.|`|60YMS1xkaa	Yes.    1. A fetus is not a baby - you are not murdering anything.  2. I would rather not want a child come into this world if it cannot be supported.  3. Even if given up for adoption, most children never end up having real homes - imagine a life like that.  4. The woman knows whether or not she is ready for it. The last thing I would want is her to go into a Major Clinical Depression.    @ below me: Under Canadian National Law a fetus is NOT considered a child. I agree wholeheartedly with my country.|`|pMwxJNicaa	YES-  If the woman is raped or cannot/would not care for the child. It IS the womans body, not just a "vessel" to carry a baby. It is her life, and her right to decide what to do with it. And with rape, a pregnancy IS NOT a womans fault, especially when she is too young to care for a child.     HOWEVER-   I do not support abortion after the fetus is is "alive" and breathing/has a brain. At that point, the woman should have already made her decision.|`|jQNDWYaeaa	If a Liberal wants to have an abortion, by all means have at it.

Therefore, abortion is murder and should be punished the same way.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	No, for the very same reason the first respondent gave.    Fiery, I suggest you look up "feticide".

They just have to jump over more hurdles.|`|v4qLlGGhaa	Yes.    1. Foster care is costing tax payers.  2. Adoptions are not authorized to an unmarried person or couple.  3. More foster kids who get abused and end up as runaways.  4. Women will perform them with hangers if they are not legal.|`|zftm6qkKaa	It's important to understand that abortions go on whether legal or not. Before Roe v. Wade, authorities never pulled dead or butchered rich women from back alleys. Sadly, it was always the poor who suffered. The affluent however, had their doctors perform the procedure in the comfort and safety of their medical office. Nobody ever knew they did it. In the unlikely chance somebody did find out. Theyd claim they had a miscarriage and were just heartbroken but will try to conceive again someday.    Well, everybody knew they were lying through their teeth but you had to give then that one percent chance that they might be telling the truth.    I remember before Roe v. Wade when my mother, grandmother, and another woman were at our kitchen table. They had just come back from a funeral of a friend who was a victim of a botched abortion. With tears streaming down my grandmothers face she chokingly said, "It's a damn shame that we live in a country where dogs receive better treatment than a woman."    My father drove an ambulance in Washington D.C. He and my mother cried when Roe v. Wade passed as it meant my father and his colleagues wouldnt have to look at those horrid scenes from botched abortions anymore.    Back then, the pillars of the community knew who the abortion doctors were. They made sure they were around. Not just to take care of slip ups at home but more importantly, to take care of their little secrets. The local Sheriff was well aware of what was going on. But if he wanted to keep his job and win his next election, he knew hed better watch his Ps and Qs. Get it? Meanwhile, the sheriff helped pull injured and dead poor women out from back alleys. It wasnt right that the poor suffered while the affluent didnt. That scenario is one of many reasons R v. W passed.    The problem with contemporary views on abortion is the element of time. People have forgotten or are too young to know what went on before Roe v. Wade. And the GOP isnt going to remind us either.  Against our best interest, they use the issue to stir our emotions to sucker us for our votes.    Pro-Choice is Pro-Life
AA10719402	I like the idea in that it goes specifically to pay off debts.....    But I wonder what it would do inflation wise.  And I also wonder what it would do investment wise.      Investment is built on someone's debt more often than not.  It doesn't have to be this way, but we made it so.      I think if the Federal Reserve actually gave an incentive to put money in old fashioned savings accounts, we would be on the right track too.  As it stands, no one can get any decent money from traditional savings so they look for other instruments like Mortgage backed securities.    I think with the inflation thing...  If it were done right, then we would pay off our debts and then the Fed would have to significantly contract money supply to ease inflation.  There would be excessive money in the system and if they didn't absorb it, it would most assuredly go into the next bubble to pop.    __  Christopher..

In UK when you married citizen and you are already on legal status I-E Student visa or work permit, You don't need to go to your own country and apply from there in other case you have to.    If you are legal the procedure is that you have to apply for spouse visa , You just need to filled some forms and send them with evident that could be utilities bills on same address and Pictures of ceremony. they will ask you some basic question which is like how you met, what ur partner likes and dislike. and at the end there is more chances to get spouse visa, so after 2 years of successful married life and you partner who is citizen has no objection you can apply for indefinite stay after which its very easy to get citizen . check on the link it might be helpful.
kDj5zUXoaa	try this      If you are arrested and you go to court, just remember that in a criminal action, you have to understand the law or it is a reversible error for the court to try you. If you don't understand the law, they can't try you.         In any traffic court case or tax case you are called into court and the judge reads the law and then asks, "Do you understand the charges?"         Defendant: No, Your Honor, I do not.         Judge:        Well, what's so difficult about that charge? Either you drove the wrong way on a one-way street or you didn't. You can only go one way on that street, and if you go the other way, it's a fifty dollar fine. What's so difficult about this that you don't understand?"         D: Well, Your Honor, it's not the letter of the law, but rather the nature of the law that I don't understand. The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution gives me the right to request the court to explain the nature of any action against me, and upon my request, the court has the duty to answer. I have a question about the nature of this action.         J: Well, what is that - what do you want to know?         Always! Ask them some easy questions first, as this establishes that they are answering. You ask:         D: Well, Your Honor, is this a Civil or Criminal Action?"         J: It is criminal. (If it were a civil action there could be no fine, so it has to be criminal).         D: Thank you, Your Honor, for telling me that. Then the record will show that this action against ___(Straw Man Name)___ is a criminal action, is that right?         J: Yes.         D: I would like to ask another question about this criminal action. There are two criminal jurisdictions mentioned in the Constitution; one is under the Common Law , and the other deals with International Maritime Contracts , under an Admiralty Jurisdiction . Equity is Civil, and you said this is a Criminal action, so it seems it would have to be under either the Common Law, or Maritime Law. But what puzzles me, Your Honor, is, there is no Corpus Delicti here that gives this court a jurisdiction over my person and property under the Common Law. Therefore, it doesn't appear to me that this court is moving under the Common Law.         J: No, I can assure you this court is not moving under the Common Law.         D: Well, thank you, your Honor, but now you make the charge against me even more difficult to understand, the only other criminal jurisdiction would apply only if there was an International Maritime Contract involved and I was a party to it, it had been Breached, and the court was operating in an Admiralty Jurisdiction.         I don't believe I have ever been under any International Maritime Contract, so I would deny that one exists. I would have to demand that such a contract, if it does exist, be placed into evidence, so that I may contest it, but surely, this court is not operating under an Admiralty Jurisdiction.         You just put words in the judge's mouth.         J: No, I can assure you, we're not operating under an Admiralty Jurisdiction. We're not out in the ocean somewhere - we're right here in the middle of the State of North Carolina, No, this is not an Admiralty Jurisdiction.         D: Thank you, Your Honor, but now I am more puzzled than ever. If this/these charge/s is/are not under the Common Law, or under Admiralty - and those are the only criminal jurisdictions mentioned in the Constitution - what kind of jurisdiction could this court be operating under?         J: It's Statutory Jurisdiction.         D: Oh, thank you, Your Honor. I'm glad you told me that. But I have never heard of that jurisdiction. So, if I have to defend under that, I would need to have the Rules of Criminal Procedure for Statutory Jurisdiction. Can you provide me with the location of a copy?|`|UeDGiKSyaa	I think you can only get one reduction a year.

Do you think Obama is the first president to eat expensive food?|`|0hT85XLzaa	Well, yes I'm sure the President of the United States should wear a paper bag to work and wear shoes that have holes in them and eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches....real smart    First of all, I don't even know if what you wrote about the hundred dollar meal is even true but if you become President one day, you can have those perks.    I'm sure after graduating from Harvard at the top of his class and running a spectacular 2 year campaign - he has earned it.|`|7UEkikfiaa	im not sure what your point is,  but you shouldn't just reference your "question" at Obama  because all the other presidents ate the same way....|`|ZxtEh7yZaa	Yeah but the bigwigs in industry should be ashamed of making a profit..Impeach this BOZO!|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Link please.

I'd also like to see a link.|`|kT7GCNnCaa	The tenderloin is from the upper back and is from a muscle that is used very rarely buy the bovine.  It is considered the most tender and lean and you often find it in bacon wrapped filets because it is so lean.  Paying $102 per pound is not right at all.  I buy my meet in bulk and pay about $8 for the same cut.  Yes that is wasteful as I could feed me and my wife very good meet for a month at the cost of one pound of that loin.    Yes, interesting that they pay for their own groceries if that is the case then more power to him and then maybe we are paying to much for government positions.|`|5lflypTiaa	There's isn't a cut of beef that costs half that much. Somebody's been lying to you.|`|9FSHsHrNaa	I saw it discussed on CNN also, they were wondering where that part of meat came from....  I thought they were kidding, !

What do I care?          Now some see it as a separation.  I don't.  I see it as pride in heritage, but also a pride in America.    That we each came from different ancestries, but we have come together to all be American.  Mexican-American, Native American, Caucasian-American, African-American, Asian-American, whatever.  We are all proud of our heritage, AND we are all American.    That is the beauty of America.  It took the best of all cultures, and combined them to be the best.  That "hyphenated american bs" is the celebration of that.|`|kT7GCNnCaa	If we all called ourselfs Americans we might be on the same page on so many issues.

Oh darn it that had to offend someone...   umm I'm a human and I love my life and I will live it to the best of my ability.  Darn it I know I just offended someone else with that last one.

Notice how many lobbyists there are for the various ethnic "communities."      The neighbors came from India, and their daughters are friends with my son. I've always thought of them as American, because they listen to Hannah Montana, talk about American cartoons, and wouldn't know a Brahmin cow if it bit them on the ***.      ^^^I have edited, but I have to say I respect and agree with Heathen (sp?)..."American of *********-descent" is very appropriate, and includes more into what the ideal of America is.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	The problem is a lack of positive self image.  Insecure people must be able to identify with something that gives them a sense of Identity and sets them apart from the very ones they want recognition from.|`|AA10973169	Because our country is a melting pot and that's one of the things that makes us great, I don't want us to lose sight of our heritage.    However, I prefer that we say "American of Irish descent" or "American of African descent".    Because this is my country I put it first.  But I don't think it's any less patriotic to remember your heritage.

2uDlTBuUaa	War happens after all other alternatives have been used to no avail.  Diplomacy is always the first course of action followed by sanctions, but when all else fails we unfortunately have to use brute strength.  I think in terms of Afghanistan we had no other option but to deploy troops to the region after 9/11.  To not display some force would have undoubtedly led to another attack on American soil.  Although I deplore Bush he is right when he stated after his actions there have been no further attacks on US soil, there has to be something said for that.  All that being said no one ever wants to go to war.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	Other than ending slavery, Fascism, Nazism, Communism and preserving freedom, war has never solved anything.

Danforth and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey removed the requirement of a wife to inform/get permission from her husband before getting an abortion.        1978 Paton v. Trustees of British Pregnancy Advisory Service Trustees--the husband lost the case.      In Canada, Tremblay v. Daigle, where a man tried to force his girlfriend to carry the fetus to term.  The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately ruled that there was no precedent for a man's right to protect his "potential progeny"    Regarding the ethics of the situation, it has been pointed out if one grants a man veto power over a womans choice to have an abortion in cases where he is willing to pay for the child, why not grant him the right to demand an abortion where he is unwilling to provide for the child?"  Kind of a sticky wicket there, eh?|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	That was the basis of Roe V. Wade - and due to the medical privacy laws, it was legal for the woman to have an abortion without the father's/husband's consent because it would breach doctor/patient privilege to reveal the mother/wife is pregnant.    And that has been the entire issue with the abortion thing - no one can find a way around the privacy issue without it blanketing everyone.

The coupons were handed out because the government mandated the change.  Although it benefits us all, we are being forced to incur a cost.  Those in power at the time (before Obama, possible before the Congress turned Democrat) felt that the right thing to do was to reimburse us for this burden.    The fact that the boxes are made in China has nothing to do with the original premise.    Besides, anyone in the U.S. could make the boxes and sell them if they would like to.|`|0Ph07tDUaa	Both China and US will be stimulated. China will increase production but then the retail companies will also be stimulated by increased sales causing a temporary job need increase. It will also increase demand for transportation as the converters will also need to be transported. If you get a coupon for a tv converter as well if the store is laid out well that will not be the only thing you buy. so the stores will increase sales by increasing the number of people going to them causing whatever else that is purchased to be stimulated through that as well. plus the mark up on most items is quiet a bit so it will most likely stimulate the american economy more than it will the chinese economy.    (side comment on the guy telling us Obama is passing a bill for the sale of only american made converters. That would destroy the free market system and impose a system that is very similar to communism. If he adds an extra tax to the converters from china that is a very different thing than manipulating the market like that.)
IsRbs6Elaa	Yeah im pretty sure your full of crap sayin you was predicting it your just sayin that cause its actually happening. You better quit lying|`|kOsJ63KFaa	My prediction..The dollar will be next to worthless by June. You can not add 1.7 trillion to the currency base in six months without super inflation.

gqoIfbH0aa	First and foremost, it has always been illegal for an adult to have sexual relations with a minor, in the U.S. at least. (Post 1900's.)    Were you really this oblivious? I must say... If they changed the law LAST August shouldn't word of this have reached you sooner? shouldn't your parents have intervened? They are irresponsible for allowing such a relationship to occur.    But if someone was defending your boyfriend in this case then they'd probably already feel like this was hopeless, but they may try to attack at the fact Proposition 8 banned gay marriage but whoever was married before the law was able to stay together.    But this is a whole other issue, gay and lesbian relationships are at least reasonable, a 14 year old and an 18 year old together is a much larger taboo believe it or not. Homosexuals are legally accepted whereas people of your type are not. So ignore Prop 8.    I don't see any way you could change any of this and I personally believe this law is perfectly rational, it's not as if they banned you from being together, period. They just banned sexual relations.    Pardon my ignorance but Canada has a ghetto area now?    I understand your feelings then if they banned you from being together period but isn't that an invasion of privacy? If the government can look in your life and relationships and say you can't be together then that's definitely an invasion of privacy. As long as no sexual acts are done then it should be legal but otherwise I'd say it's fair.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Yes, that is fair.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	What's wrong with this picture?|`|c07v7O80aa	Are you channeling Bill Clinton?

We have to make a cutoff point somewhere. Sorry you had to fall in the cracks and perhaps a judge will take it into consideration, but like it or not it IS for your well being as well as every other 14 yr old out there who gets used by older guys. Ignorance of the law has never been an excuse. I don't think they'll change that any time soon.|`|nbibIzC5aa	Your boyfriend will need to get an attorney to represent him.  The law was changed and it is unfair but the state has a greater responsibility it believes to protect children.  In most states these laws that exist have exceptions which allow people with a couple of years difference in age to continue dating without the fear of prosecution but rarely is it a difference of four years.      On another note about your additional statement, an attorney will be able to let your boyfriend know if he violated another law for which he may have violated.  Many states have various laws on child abuse and sexual abuse.      Hope this helps.

vl6OtBfWaa	There are many ways but I will share this one.  When someone dies there body is consumed by flesh eating maggots.  These maggots have a life cycle from pupae through maggot to fly and then they lay eggs in the carcass and the cycle starts again.    The length of each stage of the maggots life is precisely known so when you find a dead body and you see where in the life cycle the maggots are you can tell how long the body has been dead.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	DNA testing..marks..bruises..|`|e2e2ccd6c15e732cbfc8b82485ecb4ebaa	No.|`|KQL3tqS7aa	You need to watch Dr. G Medical Examiner!

gqoIfbH0aa	Just talk to her, face to face, and don't use any technology in this where the memory could be saved and used against you in a negative way, her words will have to prove any sort of blackmailing, and you could argue otherwise.    Put it this way, if she decides to say you were blackmailing her in court, then what's the first question someone will ask???    Why?    This is where she is trapped, she can either take a bit of money from you which will most likely not be taken in the event of this shady business being exposed, the court will take her credibility into question since she has been hiding her parents wrongdoings for so long.    But blackmail is a risky business no matter what you say about it. Those are dirty tactics listed above I must admit.    I reccomend that you just gather any paperwork that PROVES you don't owe her anything, evidence doesn't lie and if you have enough you can easily avoid paying for anything besides legal fees.    OR     If the legal fees are more than what your ex is trying to get you for, settle the case without the use of a lawyer and just leave while you still can.      Oh and about her parents, report them to the police for their wrongdoing and just forget the blackmailing.|`|l1ynPOiSaa	Your bitterness is equal to hers.tell THEM in person.|`|C8rRM4p5aa	Don't blackmail her...Just report them.

Hopefully that doesn't happen though. Because I'm sure you and I both don't want that to happen.'    Don't say that you're going to tell, and especially don't say that the only way the proper authorities would find out is if she didn't drop the lawsuit. Don't mention the lawsuit at all. Therefore it's not blackmail. You're not saying if she doesn't do it you'll report it. All you're saying is that you hope that they aren't reported, someway, somehow.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	An anonymous note could do the trick, not in your handwriting of course.|`|DujXZCd9aa	I'm afraid you can't.

Please try to remember in these situations that you got together because you saw something in each other. Try to play nice as best as you can. Besides, I doubt either of you have substantial proof.|`|nbibIzC5aa	Obviously you cannot legally blackmail someone since it is a crime. Just talk to her in person and let her know that your conscience will not let you keep this information about her family quite any more; that you must do the right thing and let the authorities know of their wrong doings.  Perhaps then she will make a deal with you.  If that does not work, then an anonymous phone call to the proper authorities is in order.      Do not try to blackmail her because if she is this vindictive then it is likely she will call the cops on you and you will be in more trouble.      Hope this helps.

c07v7O80aa	If this is a school team, you need to report this to your principal NOW, before you come under suspicion and all of the coaches get suspended pending the investigation. It's flat out theft, and if you know she's stealing the funds and don't report it, it could well be the end of your coaching career and your employment.    This is no kidding. You are headed for deep and serious trouble keeping this to yourself. Do NOT accept the money from her. Do NOT talk to her this weekend. If you have any sense, you will call the principal NOW, tonight, and not wait until Monday. DO NOT INVESTIGATE OR TRY TO GATHER EVIDENCE. Leave that to the school and the police.     It will definitely hit the fan when it comes out, but you need to cover yourself now. You do NOT want to feature in the coming news stories as one of those suspended. No one will notice that you aren't ever charged, but they will ALL remember you were suspended.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	That is a miss-appropriation of funds and you could file criminal charges against her for it. why don't you call her and tell her if the money is not in your hands by Saturday at say 10:00 am you are going to the police about it.

Gather as much evidence as you can and take that evidence to the school authority over you.  Give the authority copies, not originals, keep the originals until they are requested by law enforcement. If that school authority does not follow through, take your evidence to your local police department.
K7x1RHVFaa	I would have to say , yes.    I think if they can arrest you for taking a picture of another person's child without the parent's permission, they can arrest you for sexual harassment of a child if the parent decides that you are too intimate with that child. The fact that you refer to it as a kiss brings into question your intent for rubbing noses with a child. Some will argue it is foreplay. You are trying to work your way into other more intimate behavior.    I can't see you going to jail for it but you could face a fine and a restraining order. I am figuring they will argue corrupting the morals of a minor. Again, we are talking a misdemeanor at best and it will be brought about by the parents or school.     This is a gray area that some could make a mountain out of a mole hill.    I hope this helps.    Good Luck.|`|e158WyFGaa	No,i dont see the "illegal" part about it|`|UspK4SQBaa	Are you serious?|`|7igxiGrAaa	Why would it be illegal?

I think any sort of close touching to a child that you aren't familiar with family/friend wise is fairly shady.    Illegal no... arouse suspicion most definitely.    Americans value their personal space.  Our culture doesn't condone foreign touching from a stranger.. .that's just how it is.|`|AA11124254	Probably not.  However, a battery is defined as a "harmful or offensive touching".  As the child is not capable of deciding what is harmful or offensive, the decision would be up to the parent if they felt it was harmful or offensive.  Unlikely, but possible.|`|Ng4UNMV7aa	Well, in the United States, I'm sure it's not illegal, but it is still very strange.

It's not even illegal to kiss in the normal fashion if it's not your own, as long as it's not sexual in nature.  I kiss my friends 3 year old daughter every time I see her - sometimes the little darling even tries to kiss my lips.  It's just affectionate so there's nothing wrong with it.    It would be a bit weird if it was a kid you didn't know, or know the family....|`|w5oh9NDfaa	There are sexual harassment laws that identify any unwanted touch as being sexual harassment and if i were the parent of the child that some stranger just came up and Eskimo kissed i would see to it that they never nuzzled another stranger's child's nose again!|`|L0jeEhChaa	you're talking rubbing noses, right?   I'm thinking it would depend on the circumstances. If a teacher or daycare worker rubbed noses with all the kids, I don't think I'd mind.

If you want freedom of speech, go to a government run forum.|`|tDZMJue9aa	i do know that they are not a public thing, and they are allowed to have their rules, the thing is on this site democrats or liberals are reporting anything and everything they can from a republican or anyone who questions obama, i asked a question yesterday that said what do you think about the closing of gitmo now. and put a link to an article on the front page of yahoo about the army trails and that was it, deleted, someone tell me why..lol cause i dont know...a question can call yahoo republicans morons and stupid but use it in your answer and they report you, seriously one way to stop it is to start reporting each and every single one of them if we do it enough someone will eventually stop but its like right now we are all rolling over and letting them run this site..why|`|kwYxQp0Maa	Your constitutional rights are only against government.  A private company, school etc isn't bound by anything in the Bill or Rights.  You are posting on thier website and servers and they can do anything they want with your postings.|`|p5F2LtmNaa	For one thing, Yahoo is privately owned! Two, anything that is considered racist! Let me give you an example; awhile back, I made a comment about affirmative action, they deleted and then warned me on doing so!|`|QMzsM2fkaa	Yahoo doesn't, people flag it down.  Why does everything have to be a conspiracy theory to you guys?|`|cWmx0J4jaa	Yahoo is a private enterprise that can edit any content as it sees fit. And trust me, they do!|`|5lflypTiaa	It's not just Obama questions they erase. They have no idea what they're doing and just respond to reports from different people. It's just easier for them.|`|a10073c24d2f8cc09a1ff3253cd43cf4aa	It's their ballgame, that's why!|`|PJH9vHf1aa	Freedom of speech only apllies to public situations. This is privately ran. You made an agreement when you signed on with Yahoo. There is no freedom of speech here.
lvBUl3Zdaa	Do you call other people by their middle name, like always? Do other people call you by your middle name? Nope. The only reason why you're doing it is to pretend you can say something racist without getting called on it.|`|ln6A3ITtaa	Who gives a flying ****???|`|1KGXts5Daa	Because, like is true of a lot of verbal communication, it is not necessarily what words one uses (yes, you're absolutely correct, the President's full name is, in fact, Barack Hussein Obama), but rather, the context in which it is used, and the inflection/tone one uses when communicating the information that is most likely to cause offense.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	You know the answer to this, so this is not really a question but a rant.  In case you still want to pretend you don't know the answer, I'll tell it to you:  because you are obviously using it as a way to put him down and he wasn't.  Did you think no one knew?|`|mPLXUorTaa	I don't have a problem with Barack Hussein Obama, because some people really do call him that without it being in a derogatory manner.  It is his name after all.  It's Hussein, B. Hussein Obama, Hussein Obama, Barack HUSSEIN Obama, B Hussein O, etc. that are obviously used to affiliate him with Saddam Hussein, the Muslim population, and the Middle East.  It's sad.|`|neuprBeGaa	Because you pronounce "Hussein" as an insult.  Yes, we can hear the difference even through the Internet.|`|9rhmeb7raa	I have no idea. Title 3 of United States Code requires that both the President and the Vice President use their full name when being sworn into office. That's why it was Ronald Wilson Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, William Jefferson Clinton, etc.|`|Q8R9E7lDaa	Because it's like Blacks who think using the N word is okay among themselves but not for others.    Also, they want to deny Obama's Muslim background when he was in Kenya.|`|1du7Nbfbaa	Because you are intending to offend them.|`|27104bc8bd5a195c9a918faf29fbd9deaa	I've seen people who will appraviate his first name but spell out his middle name those are the people who get annoying but I think just saying OBAMA we would know who you were talking about|`|kT7GCNnCaa	To start Obama issued a notice some months ago that using his middle name was not accepted and he would boycott anyone who did.  I think that his middle name has a stigma associated with it and I'm really scared of how he played it.|`|7Tesm2vwaa	Because you are an idiot about it.|`|HTitV7Plaa	They are not angry.  It's how the name is taken out of context.   Ignorant people have tried to make it sound like he is a terrorist.      Pessimistic Republicans, who live in fear, look for things to support their negativity.|`|mHOvddIvaa	You are not stupid. You know the answer. When you compare him Saddam Hussein people WILL get offended. It is also VERY childish.|`|26W0Fb2Uaa	cuz they be haterz.  stupid racist blacks.  honestly.  besides, obama is half-white anyways.
lvBUl3Zdaa	Since you refuse to call him by his correct name, I can see why people would report you for saying racist things. Try to ask real questions and you won't get reported.    Compared to you, he is god-like.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	It is the beginning of the infringement on Free thought and Free Speech.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Because you should wait till you have an actual legitimate complaint.    All this "sky is falling" stuff is only wrecking your credibility.  Especially in the light of all the things Republicans let Bush get away with.    I know if Obama called the Constitution "just a god % ned piece of paper", the Repubs would want to investigate and impeach right away.  But since it was one of their own....|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Ah yes.

Just stop being an idiot about it.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Because he's a socialist and socialism makes everyone equal.  It's like highschool, where all other kids get their chance to get even with the popular ones.    IOW, no one is special except for the President.  Whose full name is  Barak Hussein Obama.  Tough if ya don't like it, but calling him Hussein is legit.|`|qTCo9QW2aa	lol, he's not God, but a lot of people seem to think he is...|`|PJH9vHf1aa	His name is Barack ...I don't think he goes by Hussein. Moron.|`|a10073c24d2f8cc09a1ff3253cd43cf4aa	A "violation notice"? Really? Just look back at someof the media that pictured "JUDAS" from pre WW2 Germany and replace it with " Republican." It's the "Move ON" thing to do these days. Just ask George Soros!|`|c4b57b3534465ec39ec8b5c38862f872aa	I take it you are referring to Yahoo answers.  If so I have no idea.  As for criticism of the President, seems the republicans and good ol' "Rushie" are hard at work doing just that.  It is good an American freedom and one we want to protect.|`|AA10219898	are you talking about president obama did you know that he won and he is the president until he does do something to complain about then you can talk but i don't think he will ever measure up to the mess that was created  for 8 years|`|tAej7qsqaa	because he's the media's sweetheart.

Don't try to act like its only when Obama is questioned. I am always surprised to see when serious thought provoking questions about the aforementioned are still up the next day. Surprised that some cry baby didn't run and tattle to Y!A about someone's question that they didn't like. Mind you, nothing was wrong with the question, no 'Guidelines' broken. Just two crybabies wanted the questions gone. Yet the gutter garbage remains active around here. And if your questions broke 'Guidelines', then they should be deleted, and you warned. I have no problem with that if its really true.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Because it was a smear that was clearly exposed as a smear and by continuing it using Yahoo as a platform you are simply ranting and deliberately denigrating someone.|`|1KGXts5Daa	Maybe because the person you identified by name in your question is not anyone who holds any political office in this country.

3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Go to your local DHFS office.      My sister lives in WI, and the father of her 16 year old lives in AZ, and she successfully sued him - and won - back child support, as well as he had to pay for all medical expenses that were incurred by the state of WI for him.  He was on disability, and they garnished his SS checks.    Go check it out.  WI is one of the best states for this stuff.  If you have his SS number, they will want that.  If not, it is fine - they will get it.    Good luck!!|`|KQL3tqS7aa	Your state's child support enforcement division should be trying to get the support in whatever way they can whether it be garnishing his wages, taking his tax returns, putting a lien on any real estate he may own, anything.  If your case worker isn't doing their job, request a different one or go above them to their supervisor.  They can also get him on contempt of court beings that child support is a court-ordered obligation.  I would suggest taking this matter to someone other than your current case worker.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	I've heard of deadbeat dads choosing to be drifters all their lives rather than pay child support.  It's amazing how far some people will go to escape it.    Suing him won't do a bit of good because even if you win, there's no way to collect until he's on disability or SS.  Even with the stricter laws today, there are deadbeats that still manage to slip through for decades.    Getting a lawyer was a smart idea.  But what is really needful is to be able to tack on the cost of a private investigator to the bill every time he needs to be tracked down.
p21qJQ4Jaa	well if you are going in ROTC at a university you will be going to OCS not "boot camp"...the only good suggestion i could give for that is to have a close to perfect PFT score...    18minute 3 mile run time  100 crunches  20 pull ups    if you have this, good grades, and a good attitude you can be almost gauranteed to get contracted.|`|htaxf1jJaa	Well my brother graduated boot camp from Parris Island in August 2008...and he told me pretty much how his life was there for the 13 weeks. Just prepare for a lot of screaming/teasing by the DI's and A LOT of PT [physical training] and running! The best part is mail call and bonding with your platoon cause you got all your brothers there too that you can relate with and stuff. Time flies by while you're at boot camp...i remember that my brother and I used to write letters all the time and by the 5th letter it was graduation [amazing experience..make sure your family goes =)] And make sure you aren't self concious cause you do take showers in front of everyone from your platoon, and make sure you're used to taking fast showers [scrub wash and rinse then its the next person in line to get in the shower]. Sunday you go to church or religious service [time away from the DI's!] and thats pretty much your "free day", there's no PT and you get to write letters and stuff.     For your schedule to work out and prepare for boot camp, just do some pushups, situps, and pull ups [according to your boot camp manuel...your recruit should've given you one prior to leaving for boot] and just prepare off that and run too. make sure you can do a mile in a certain amount of time..and then try running more so boot wont be that much hell on you.|`|cXzm4iqYaa	Jog...jog...and jog some more.

AA11966821	If she is a US citizen or legal permanent resident, she needs to get an application from school.  Her parents must sign and notarize their permission for her to work.  They will need her birth certificate, proof of her citizenship or legal permanent residence, and they need their gov't issued photo IDs to submit the application and get their signatures notarized.    If she is not a US citizen/legal permanent resident, she cannot get a work permit.

I guess I'll only have check in every once in awhile now! Thanks cause I've really got a lot going on but feel this is very important ! accomplice / compliant (willing) accessory / component(used)|`|U3vVGSoKaa	Sorry, I do not have the data it in front of me. But the accomplice is like a partner in the crime, and is much more involved. Also, a harsher sentence than an accessory. Think of the Accomplice as the one who drove the get away car at a bank heist. The accessory simply lent the vehicle for the crime.  The accessory , may or may not have even known it was for a bank robbery. But probably knew the  people borrowing the car were most likely up to no good.

c07v7O80aa	Mostly not. But if they act as if they expect to be let off, they could well get the ticket. Not every citizen who gets stopped gets ticketed, either.

One thing that upsets a lot of officers is when the person that is stopped pulls out his or badge right away and say I'm a cop too. This really pisses a lot of us off. Just remember that just because you are stopped it doesn't mean you will get a ticket.
eu6UQElYaa	I don't think Obama defines "transperancy" the way the rest of the world does.  To Obama transperancy means "I will tell you what I'm doing, only when it benefits me or makes me look good. And on some occasions I will tell you what I'm doing but will fail to mention the downsides and I will set out to discredit anyone who does try to mention the downsides.

3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Well, my view as a Democrat is that we need to get them out and make sure they can't get back in.  They don't help our economy, and they certainly don't pay for many of the services they use.  And now with the economy being in the crapper, is it actually productive for them to come here?  Is it productive for us?    It is illegal to come into this nation without going through proper channels.  One can't choose the laws they will follow of another country's.  I could no more go to another nation and choose what laws I am going to follow and give the reason of "I don't think it is fair to me" as the reason.    We need to gather them up and ship them back.  Mexico is now crying that it is hurting them for all of their people to illegally come into this nation.  They need to try and figure out how to fix what is wrong with their nation and then do it.  Our nation didn't get where it is today in a year or two.  It was well over 200 years.  And blood was shed.  It isn't going to be short and/or easy.  But they need to take care of it, because we can't take care of them any longer.|`|AA10653749	We have enough damn illegals...shut the damn borders..if they're here illegal,lock em up ! !|`|ynlft41Uaa	Deport every single one of them and their anchor babies back to the turd world.

All the illegal Immigrants vote Democrap...      The Fence needs to be built first.  My Plan    30FT Electric Fence, 10 Feet Below Ground, 20 Feet Above Ground    After the fence you have a 20 yard Gap that can allow trucks and such to check the fence and so.    After the 20 yard gap you have a 200 Yard Mine Field.    Then Deport all the current Illegals and deport all the ones who came here and had a child and are now US Citizens.|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	I am a democrat and here is my answer...    We should upgrade border security properly and effectively(a fence won't do that, it has never worked anywhere, if the people really want to come they will go over, around, under or through the fence), we should deport those who don't have a permanent stake in the USA(those with Children or something similar should stay) but we should provide a reasonable path to citizenship. We also need to realize that we can't round up 12 million people, anybody that believes we can is stupid. This is the stance I have on illegal immigration, and if Lou Dobbs read this he would probably have a heart attack.|`|PtHThRoNaa	Democrat.  I am against illegal immigration.  However, I don't think we can do anything until our borders are secure.  You can deport all you want, but they come back.  I don't know how we can tear families apart,  I believe we should offer them a chance at citizenship, but it has to be done the right way this time.  No more amnesty, it hasn't worked.|`|cvPjlv0Paa	I think we should try to make this country more open, so that the people who come here  can stay here and get an opportunity to succeed. i think if we find illegal immigrants here we should try to help them become legal. The thing you need to understand is, the people who come here illegally are mostly very poor people who would come here legally if they could, but they need to get to the U.S. so they could have a job, to send money back home. These people have so much less than we do, it only seems fair that we try to help them.|`|qy9imvEcaa	Get rid of all of them and stop any IMMIGRATION.     If Bush had done this after 9/11 we wouldn't be having these problems today. This includes Reagan and Carter.     Stop 'ANCHOR BABIES" and they have rights!!!     No, deport them and set up finger printing at the airport.

But to answer your question, I actually agree with your view on it.|`|HobgsxXCaa	I think in the stimulus plan the Democrats want to buy 27 million dollars worth new buses to transport them to the nearest ACORN office.  12 million to feed them only ethnic food while they wait in line to register, if they regiester as a Democrat and 157 billion for free housing, healthcare, food, lawyers, new cars and education on how to vote democratic.|`|4bb9634fc5a91b36fafd38e3fba80eecaa	but repubs. like cheap labor , why do you think they like no unions? da, da.........and cheap food serves their stomach, of never enough for them, and symbolism is there bed mate of insecurity and rightous behavior on the billboard of no dept, the me world|`|9650396843d5fb5c87832f3226bd9287aa	Democrat--first I'll give you my pipe dream:  The US aquires Mexico, divides it up into states, and our laws prevail.  Result: no border.  Our businesses that have abandoned us for Mexico will have to pay our kind of wages.    In reality, they should come here legally.  A change in the law so that any child born here of an illegal immigrant should be given the same citizenship of the parent.  We already have all other laws needed--we just need to enforce them.|`|bNOj7Up9aa	I guess we are kinda getting a feel for what the native americans felt, minus the genocide and diseased blankets.|`|HH56ptnNaa	i think we should send them back to their country where they can apply for visas or citizenship. we should not jail them we have enough trouble funding things that are useful|`|IJTcGIG7aa	First off...Immigration is actually the LEAST partisan issue you'll find.   There are too many cross cutting cleavages to label either party either way....even if the Republicans have a majority of people willing to bash immigrants, or use the fear of them, for their own gain.    I say deal with it realistically, humanely and cut the BS....    1   The REALITY of the current situation is we accept it cause this labor is absolutely essential to many businesses.   We could stop illegal immigration in a SECOND....all we have to do is make it a felony to hire aliens.   Do that, and the show is over - no jobs - they will all go home.    Don't worry - that won't happen....cause all those jobs would have to be filled by Americans, and that would be expensive.    WHY THIS WON'T HAPPEN:  You won't get this cause a) our government works for business interests even more strongly than the people and b) many people in Congress actually do care about the people....the workers.         2  What should happen is that we recognize these illegal workers as what they are....undocumented workers.   Lets provide them a 'status' as that.    WHY THIS WON'T HAPPEN:  Cause this status would eventually lead to...rights, benefits, education, health care, safe working conditions and citizenship.        3  Anyone who talks interdiction.....walls at the border, etc.....is either an idiot or is pandering to stupid racists for votes.   That will never work.   You can't stop people with a wall across a city, and this wall would be much wider and more rural.       It would be as successful as the war on drugs is at stopping drugs (all that adds is a price supports....it's why a tiny bag of flowers/leafs sells for $100, and people have to rob and steal for drugs)|`|PwR7SWbCaa	Send them back until they come here legally, and need to stay off welfare, and respect our laws|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Deport    For one, it is illegal.

That speaks for itself|`|1amF7oNwaa	REPUBLICAN - Take away their reason for being here and they will go home.    1.

Check it out after August and see what it offers with the new GI Bill.    For that first semester, see if he can use any TA since you say he will still be active duty.     What about having him take any CLEP exams, they are free for him right now and they should transfer over to almost any accredited college or university. After he gets out, he can still take CLEP exams but he will have to pay for them. They are cheaper than a face to face class.

He should talk to the College office on base about it, they can give him more options including doing CLEP before he gets out.

DgfEkFGLaa	I know that Obama had enough votes to pass that stimulus bill in the House of Representatives without the Republicans. Yet he went and talked with them, made concessions for them, did all he could to get a bipartisan vote. But they want to play their games by voting against it. I don't know what more he could have done. In the end the Republicans in the House made their choice. They said they wanted a say in the process and they had it. And most of Americans have had enough of these political positioning by them. That is why they lost seats in 2006 and 2008. If they keep it up the House will have its 60+ seats by 2010 and they may soon become smaller then the current 3rd parties are now.|`|7mOfekBWaa	Some house republicans actually liked the bill but were threatened by the minority whip that all funding for their reelection would be cut. >_    The republican party has one mission now:  simply oppose everything that the democrats propose.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	It's not a "rough game of hardball" they are playing.

I am from Maryland & he has done nothing good. He has always been the token black. He has never been one who got through based on accomplishments. Do you know anything he has done? He struggled as a student. Republicans don't seen to measure intellect. They get all excited about these people just because they are republicans. It is not working well so dems love it or atleast I do. I can tell you that you will never be able to take notes on what he says & be able to tell anyone anything from this man that was from his intellect. The republican party can be as excited as they want cause they have a fresh face that is youthful even though he is in his 50's he is youthful & eventually everything he says will end up sounding like he is a parrot in about 3 weeks. I mean it was the same way as with Palin- Hockeymom, Maverick, Polly wanna cracker. So what part of his bio is not true? I have observed him for years & he is an empty head. It is hilarious that you are going to be happy with this man just like Joe the Plumber. He does not at all compare with Obama but if you think he does & Palin does than it is fine the democrats are going to try to save this country anyway.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	I saw it in the Puffington.log.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	I've only been there once or twice to laugh at Hollywood Actors' cheesy writing.

Are they simply pointing out that Repubs are trying to Con the American people into believing CON-servatives suddenly are the people who like minorities instead of being the Exclusive White Man Club that they are?     Does Electing a Black man as the RNC Chairman mean Repubs will stop trying to dis-enfranchise minority voters or is it merely a smokescreen like Sarah Palin was?    Mike Steele is no Barack Obama....just like Sarah Palin was no Hillary Clinton. The Majority of Americans who voted Obama into the highest office in the land are not nearly as stupid as the RNC thinks they are. Palin was a miserable failure in trying to convince women voters that she was no different than Hillary and the RNC is trying to con Black people into believing that Steele is just like Obama...he is not.    Everything Mike Steele will say will be words approved by a commitee of Rich White guys holding onto Steele's puppet strings.    Ever see the show "South Park"? The one black kid on the show is named "Token"...looks to me like the Repubs have found their "Token" and will use him to sucker about 3, maybe 4 black people into switching parties.|`|25ff3871078732b22945836ac848d623aa	i can only imagine, based on what normally passes for intelligent discourse from zsa zsa huffington, her band of celebutards, and the brainless moonbats who live under the rocks over there-but when 'progressives' started posting rants against jews, i stopped paying attention|`|9hGIaDBkaa	liberals are racists|`|fRCoMzXkaa	Truth hurts, don't it?|`|AA11600810	Gosh no, I never go over there because the foam that froths from their mouth gets all over my shoes.

Obama on the other hand took on the traits of his father and is considered African American. I don't see any race card being played, it's more about qualifications, something Obama supporters no little about.|`|gau0w8LMaa	Keep thinking that way and you'll really believe it.     The right never claimed Obama, as his political view doesn't match theirs.     Steele was the best man for the job and got it.     That is the difference between the two parties, one judges on merit, the other takes in skin color, sexual orientation, and immigration status before making a judgment.     you should educate yourself and find the truth. Maybe you'll be on the right side then.|`|JxYLnTGiaa	Because conservatives are inferior people with small brains.    They can't help it. I feel sorry for them sometimes. Just give them a gun or a power tool if you want to shut them up.|`|SGwkPy62aa	The only ones left that can use the race card are white conservatives.

It will help you later on.|`|DEaIiT79aa	Oh gimmie a freaking break!!   After all the libs that shout racism against all the republicans that don't fall in step with Obama's policies??

Do you feel the man is unqualified?|`|AA10558731	Just nominating someone who happens to be Black is not "pullin the race card". The Republicans aren't making a big deal out of this, the media and the Loony Left are.    Republicans have been hiring & nominating the best people for the job for years regardless of skin color, without blowing their horn every time they give a job to a Black person. Democrats, on the other hand, can't pat themselves on the back enough when they give a job to a person of color. Obama being "Black" was the cornerstone of his run for the presidency, even though he's half White & half Arab with only a few drops of Black blood.    Face it, the only one playing the race card is you ~ another loony lefty. Shut up and sit down, loser.|`|9FSHsHrNaa	Seems to me you are pulling the Racecard!|`|b1d464d92abde2c75d6493dfe3d6c310aa	Do you understand the concept of the race card?    It's were someone cries racism.    So were did Michael Steele claim someone was being prejudice against him?|`|m5rkpk1Daa	I didn't know there was one.

America even by spending 800 billion may STILL go down the drain.. Bush did this,,REMEMBER?? Or where were you for the last eight years?? His reckless spending,,deregulation or lack there of,,created this mess.. And if Obama can see the CEO's and Wall Street need to tighten their belts today,, why didn't Bush SEE it TOO ??

Republicans like to  say its not their fault and that yanno pretty much none of the debt was accumulated in the first 6 years but only when the democrats got into Congress, so according to that logic the democrats borrowed about 6 Trillion in 2 years, which you just know aint true.

During this process it was concidered unpatriotic to disagree with the president by the fringe extremist republicans (notice I didn't say conservatives). I whole heartedly disagree with them. It is very American to disagree with your president and even government. It is also very patriotic to hope for the best for your country (even if you think that means failure for the current administration). I hope for my country's sake that Obama's inevitable failures and successes as a president make this country an even better place for myself and my family to live. Obama in my book is a necessary evil to deal with like Carter, Clinton, and FDR were. They taught us as true patriotic Americans what a good president isn't, or like Reagan taught us what a good president is.|`|Azdg9KKwaa	We the people have a U.S. Constitution that we're ignoring while the government runs rampant with our funds.  According to our Constitution, it's time to overthrow our government because they are no longer acting on behalf of the people or for the benefit of the people.  They are instead operating outside of their rights according to our Constitution and stealing from the people.    So my question to you is how do we take back our government from these thieves?  Do we still exist as 'America' or are we now owned by the foreign nations we're in debt to while our government representatives continue to make us worthless?|`|aa5f3f64fbc997444eed25e5c5ee915baa	I choose succeed because progressive policies actually take society as a whole into consideration and help preserve what's so great about this country: diversity.|`|riDBmzpVaa	I hate every **** kickin', gun toting, piece of cloth lovin' dumb **** Americans?

AA10783710	Salaries are so out of touch with reality, and I mean this from all angles.    I was born in the 1960s, and back then a newspaper wouldn't even spend the money to send a sports reporter to most away games.  Admission to a game wasn't some huge expenditure.    But then something weird happened with our concept of money.  In 1963, Liz Taylor was given the princely sum of $1 million for the movie, Cleopatra.  This was an astronomical amount of money back then, and if a studio had a couple of flops, it could bankrupt the studio.  But this was what she was paid, and I think that was the start of our very warped concept of money.    Fifteen years later, Marlon Brando was paid $10 to be on screen less than seven minutes in the movie, Superman.  At this point, money is no longer being respected.  It is thrown around on a whim, because a company, a movie studio, or a law firm has so much capital flowing into it, that they can occasionally be fiscally irresponsible.    Pro athletes used to be well paid, but generally they weren't millionaires.  Nowadays, even adjusting for inflation, player salaries are absolutely obscene.    Individual CEOs are making tens of millions a year as they preside over the demise of once grand companies.  As they are firing thousands, their compensation package staggers the mind.    On the reverse, it used to be that a man, even in a modest job, could support his wife, and the typical two kids (and a dog).  Nowadays, because real salaries adjusted for inflation haven't risen one penny since around 1956, both husband and wife must work.    But not all working class people are in this boat.  Last year I read about some town that was considering declaring bankrupcy because fixed costs had outstripped tax revenue.  Just one small part of the problem was that they had 100 fire fighters, each making around $100,000 a year.  Yes, no joke.    So we've got athletes, singers, actors, CEOs, politicians, etc. making far too much money while the average "working stiff" is getting stiffed.    I have a hard time getting enthused about athletes when they are making more in one year than I will make in a lifetime.  The sportsmanship is gone.  We've often heard pampered, preeening athletes whining about ridiculous little things, and then saying they wish they could get traded.  Hmmm.... they're being paid $10+ million and they have zero loyalty.  Will I pay $50 or more for a ticket to see these jerks?  No way.|`|tAej7qsqaa	well generally they make so much money because they earn so much money for the teams they play on.  If the teams they play for start to struggle well that's another story.|`|aMlWMkO5aa	Yes! They should have cut them a long time ago! Don't think it will happen though.|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	If people aren't willing to pay exorbitant prices for tickets and advertisers aren't willing to spend exorbitant sums for advertising time (1 second commercials on the Super Bowl?), then clubs won't be able to make enough money to cover exorbitant salaries and the athletes will have to take a pay cut. Can't pay out hundreds of millions if the club is only making a tenth of that. Simple math. Boo hoo.|`|14BXajh0aa	Even though I think that a lot of athlete a seriously over paid. I don't believe that all of these pay-cuts are going to have any positive affect on the economy at all. The country is feeling the effects of hundreds of years of shady business practices and even worse politics. It would take an overhaul of the entire world economy in order to resolve this issue. Which means a lot of very bad people would have to come clean about all of the bullshit they have been pulling for centuries. So let the ball players keep thier money it is chump change in the GRAND SCHEME of things.|`|BMGEi0yCaa	I actually think it's a great idea to cut celebrities and athlete's paychecks. I don't understand why they get paid so much anyway. I mean, I know they work hard and they get a lot of their money not from only playing on a team but also endorsement deals and what-not, and it's great that they have that fame. But what about all the people out there right now working 16 hour days and barely get paid enough to make end's meet? Those are the people who really deserve the money.     I also feel the same about Bill Gates and all those other ridiculously rich people. I mean, great, you started an empire and your gonna be making money off of it long after your gone. But really, who needs 44 billion dollars? They could build NASA and space shuttle and still have enough money to live more than comfortably! Heck, I could live comfortably on $100,000 a year - probably even $50,000.    If I had Gate's or celebrity money, I know I'd be giving out a lot to charity, because I know that I wouldn't need it all and there are people out there who just as deserving (if not more) of the money.    Unfortunately, cutting salaries like that will probably never happen and probably won't do any good anyway. Like someone else said, unless a team's company or an actor's studio is doing poorly, it probably won't happen. Which is not cool, I know. =o/|`|HCrDeJycaa	HOW ABOUT CONGRESS-they just took 90,000 more dollars for there office help|`|7G9PlO6Raa	athlete's are not paid with our tax dollars so we don't  have a dog in that hunt.

LTS3GCpQaa	Depending on what you mean you have lost already -- the cause was lost as a whole when we in the West and in Europe went through the industrial revolution and then people about our age saw the technological revolution go from it's infancy to near it's apex in our life times .     So disappearing is unlikely -- and it now all depends on whether or not "they" are looking for you ---- Meaning I could disappear relatively easily because I don't expect my government at the upper of even middle levels to care --- but if they became interested in me it would become literally impossible for me to hide on this planet . They don't care about the Amish --- and so no one looks for them -- the lower levels of governance being the police won't go looking for the Amish either based on the same reason --- they feel no need to find them (individually)      That said --- how to become more invisible ?      One don't say or do anything that would draw or generate interest. The good news with that is most of the time you have to do something spectacular to wake "them" up and that usually costs a lot of money.     Power usage is tracked --- if it goes up --- because they are looking for home grow operations and so forth -- it isn't tracked if it goes down at least for now      Solar panels and wind mills do help -- but check out something called the Baghdad battery ( e-mail me if your interested ) and other ancient ways of generating electricity ---Other conventional batterys can be used for up to 6 months and recylced and recharged off the house plugs --- but it tends to be cost prohibitive -- some friends have suggested there are ways to minimize that but I never looked into it      Tesla tubes are easy to build and can jump output significantly --- but that requires someone with at least high school shop to build the first 2 or 3 times out --- ( I didn't hang out with the shop class --and now wish I had have) Type in either Bagdad Battery or (Tesla tubes schismatics)      Microwave and radio waves go though your house daily -- right now as we speak radio CBC is pummeling through space and the house unseen by any and heard by a handful of people who mostly live in Alert or Iqaluit.      The most convient and best made radio and microwave shielding can be found in your kitchen --- your microwave ---      It becomes impossible to shield a house with the microwave shields scavenged from dead microwaves --- but you can shield your computer and phone fairly easily --- This will both protect your privacy and your health -- and if you think that is paranoid --- then look up things like      Industrial shields for sale on the internet to protect corporate privacy -- the rough costs are in the millions and law firms to Disney are paying it and saying thank you      Food --- if possible start buying food in bulk particually meat -- which believe it or not always has a higher resale value than gold does when the shi--- hits the fan -   Most farming towns have a community locker --- you can buy 1/2 a cow 1/2 a pig etc --- have it buthered and stored in the locker -- Keep it there until you figure out how to store than in your house ---     Begin creating small numbered companies -- which will be owned by you --- which will rent your apt or pay your property tax --own your home and pay your electricity bills --     If you ever go broke -- they can sue the company and you can create a new one tomorrow --      Oh and last suggestion of this novel ---  which really I meant to keep short and concise --- but I just can't --- it seems      Water --- freeze water If the shi-- really ever hits the fan -- sell bits of stored beef --- but keep the water and don't look like you have any !|`|jPtPyiYuaa	I believe it could be done really easily.

There are now dwarf trees for citrus, apples, avocados and even oil palm (which produces scads of ready-to-use diesel fuel [if you start the engine on actual diesel fuel or biodiesel]).     Best chances of that working are in a cooperative set-up where you grow one thing, and each of the 100 or so co-participants each grow something else or process something else, etc.     Lately, when most people hear "ethanol", they cuss a blue-streak - mostly because of bad press, partly due to circumstance. Look into fodder beets (grown aeroponically, if possible). They practically erupt sugar and starch, the best and cheapest feedstocks for ethanol. Ideally, find a car with a very high (PSI) compression (not ratio), as it will get better mileage on ethanol than petroleum gasoline.     Until then, though, use freekin' decoys!!     I know friends who started doing that to fend off the telemarketers. They'd use their dog's name for a magazine subscription and have a blast repeating "No, you can't talk to Nellie Woodson. ... no... because you can't... why? ... because... You can't...   ...Because she's a DOG."    The more fake names, the better so maybe bunnies would serve best as a source of names.     ...|`|NktvqJhlaa	Alaska!

If you get a job, your employeer will turn you name over to the IRS if they are paying anything for you such as insurance.

You have methods for canning and preserving. You have a windmill and/or a hand pump water well. You have an outhouse. Everybody works sustain the existence. You hunt wild birds and other game like rabbits, deer and squirrel to supplement your livestock. You trade with your neighbors for what you need or sell your  goods roadside.

They will feed you mainly keynesian garbage.      Read up and see if any of these schools are near you, these are the ones that teach austrian economics.     http://www.mskousen.com/Books/Articles/0...    im in law school so no, i am not applying my degree much.|`|Uaci5YXWaa	My first BA was in Economics.  Then I did a BAdmin in Political Science, Police Science, Accounting and a Master of Science in Taxation.  I worked for several US and foreign government agencies, not-for-profits and law firms.  Now I work for a CPA firm.    Study what interests you.  Do what makes you happy.   Life is like being a mouse in a maze.  One path leads you to cheese and another to an electric shock. You never really know where you will end up until you get there.      Life is too short to waste time on things you do not enjoy.  Check out the link below.  If you like it, you've found your calling.  If you do not find it fascinating, then study something else.|`|hZVhRjMPaa	Yeah, I am working on a Ph.d.  If your goal is to analyze public policy, then you should plan on either getting a MA or Ph.d in economics.  If not, then consider getting a public policy degree combined with economics.     If you want to study public policy, then an economist can also hurt millions of people with the wrong policy prescription.  You have to be careful.    If you do plan on getting a graduate degree in economics, then plan on taking higher order math classes as an undergraduate, since graduate economics is very math intensive.  Take as many stats, calculus, and matrix algebra classes as you can.|`|DEaIiT79aa	you don't have to major on economics for that.  Like the other guy said on here...  major in accounting if you wan't the best grip on how business works.  (can't believe I"m agreeing with an Ole Miss guy.... I'm a Mississippi State Grad.  All in good fun)   You will get a good mix of finance, marketing, economics, and accounting that will really help in the business world.   Accounting is the language of business.|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	Banking here--I would say I like the study of the data, interpreting the data, presenting the data but in Banking most of those you present to have no clue what Economics does--it is not a science--it is a pseudo science, so the results do not always match the projected data.
d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	You are mistaken, as usual about what Democrats or liberals (not all Democrats are liberals) believe. We believe in hard work too . . but what we see are glass ceilings where only some people are allowed to move through .. those ceilings effectively prevent women and minorities from obtaining the same goals as white men. A woman can be just as educated, just as effective, just as skilled . .and not receive equal opportunities as a white male. Collectively I have heard . . that a woman is not a good investment in a company because she can get pregnant . . I have heard that a man and woman who are equally qualified to hold the same job .. the job will be given to the man because he needs to support a family, while a woman does not (even when she is a single parent).    It has nothing to do with education . .it has to do with our culture and society and how people view others.  People can be cut down in the work place at every  opportunity . . subtle . . so no one notices that the white male is promoted while a woman or black counterpart remains in the same position indefinitely.  So when a Democrat talks about fairness . . they are talking about making sure that a person is being judged by the content of their skills or their character and not on their sex or the color of their skin.    And many of the wealthy or super rich . .didn't get there from 'hard work' . .they were born into wealth or they got there because they know loop holes or how to play the system, use inside trading, and other under the radar tactics that an honest person would never dream of doing.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Lol....Why do you accuse people of 'crying' all the time....project much??    Interesting that you are complaining about other people...complaining. Who is the actual "cry baby' here??   Regardless, I don't have a 4 year degree or a GED. I have 2 doctorates.   And, clearly, YOU don't have a 4 year degree either. I can't imagine what type of college/university would allow you to graduate with your poor spelling.  To quote you: "They don't' want their to be individualism. Individuals is what makes this countries."  To correct you: "They don't want there to be individualism. Individuals are what make this country.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	I don't know what you are talking about.    I am liberal, and I was brought up by liberal parents.  I was taught that you get in life what you work for, and if you weren't the best, you weren't going to win/play.    What I get pissed at are these Wall Street morons using MY tax dollars to pay themselves bonuses???  I don't get a bonus when I fail, and neither should they.  Where is your little rant for those idiots??  They are doing exactly what you are ranting against - they are getting paid/winning when they didn't win.  It is comparable to those soccer games where they don't keep score, and everyone gets a trophy.  They all got bonuses, and none of them did their job well enough to make their company any money.  How does one get that gig??  Because I want that one - paid no matter what??    I have a Masters Degree, and I have worked for what I have today.  I have a wonderful husband that is a professor of history at a university, and a great daughter that will be starting school in the fall.  I own my own business, live in a very nice home, have a nice car, and rather enjoy my life.  And I am a liberal Democrat.    What is your issue with me again??|`|tDZMJue9aa	right everyone is the same, obviously as many people as complain about the violation notices we should all think the same too, boring place if you ask me, and for a party that says they are about being fair funny i aint feeling it nor do i think most republicans on this site...|`|jlXPsVfdaa	Liberals have a misguided definition of fairness.    Fairness should be defined as a situation where the hardest working and smartest achieve success and receive greater compensation compared to those who did not work as hard to achieve the same thing.|`|s25Dh5RVaa	You have to understand something. The people who made poor decision after poor decision in life are now at the bottom, pouting about how unfair the world is. The Dems want to gain that percentage of votes, so they preach about making the world a "fair place" for these "disadvantaged" people.     It's all about the power.|`|1amF7oNwaa	SINCE THE 1960'S THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONVINCE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	It's an emotional arguement that wins over the US voter|`|gau0w8LMaa	Life isn't fair and they just don't get that.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Life may be unfair, but that is no reason for the government to permit people to cheat and exploit the most powerless among us. Wall Street CEOs do not work harder than men and women who work multiple jobs earning minimum wage. I get tired of hearing people like you trying to justify redistribution of wealth from the working class to the ultra-rich to assuage your guilty conscience.|`|pM81f5tnaa	You want "everyone starting at an equal point"?  So my kids attend the same school that Caroline Kennedy went to?  And my daddy gets me into Yale?  Hooray for that!  I'm voting for you!|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	Your last comment about education was extremely ignorant.  Not everyone that drops out of school is a deadbeat.  A lot of these kids have learning disabilities and eventually reach a point where they are made to feel like they cannot improve or cannot handle the pressure.  They should not be held at "fault."  These are people that need to be counseled in what they are good at.  Just because someone is not a scholar in academics does not mean they cannot or don't deserve to make a living.    And another thing, just because someone has a college degree does not mean that person has a high paying job.  I have a Masters degree and I'm still stuck at a crap job with crap pay.  And it's because of the economy that Bush destroyed, not because of my level of education.    The reason why Liberals claim that it is the wealthy's fault that they are poor is because of the Republican way of thinking.  They give all the tax cuts to the rich while the middle and lower classes have to pay the rest.  If you think that is right, there is something very very wrong with you.  The rich are the ones that can AFFORD to pay higher taxes (and believe me, they would have plenty left over for their toys).  Trickle down does not work!    Now, to talk about Fairness.  Why do Liberals want things to be fair?  Because that's the way it should be.  ALL human beings should be treated equally -- meaning race, gender, class, or sexual orientation should not have any say in whether or not you can have a certain job, get certain pay, get married, etc... Every human being in this country deserves the same freedoms.  I thought that this is what our country was all about -- everyone is entitled to Life, Liberty, and the Persuit of Happiness, right?|`|1j19zyeYaa	Simple ! Liberal radical democrats cannot win unless they silence their opposition ; that is the definition of fairness to a radical liberal democrat ! When radical liberal democratic policies are exposed to the  "educated public" for the lies` and falsehoods they are , then to a liberal that is "unfairness" ! Fairness to liberals is being able to silence anyone who challenges their self anointed privilege of their elitist "greed & power" ! That `s why the radical liberal democrats are trying so hard to silence Rush Limbaugh ! Rush is a voice that is the opposition to the radical liberal democrats` who have total control of every other liberal bias` media outlet in the nation !|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	I'm afraid you're mistaken.  It's the Democrats who want everyone to start at an equal point.  That's why we support equal education for all our children, not just the affluent children.    I've never heard a Democrat "demonize" anyone for becoming wealthy.  Do you have a cite?|`|fRCoMzXkaa	Provide one example of the media and the liberals demonizing one person that has worked hard and gotten rich and did all while playing by the rules.|`|tAej7qsqaa	Because they think they are entitled to what everyone else has.|`|RzlaAklGaa	cause they have nothing else to do.|`|iLIM6O2zaa	Because they suck at life.|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	Democrats actually want this... "everyone starting at an equal point to achieve the goal"..  That is the whole point.. Clearly, everybody is not starting at that same point.. And since there is no real way to get that, the best way is to try and even the odds a little with "progressive" policies.    Differance.. Republicans seem to want an equal system, for (like you just mentioned) a very unfair playing field. A person born into a billion dollar business getting taxed the same rate as a person born into poverty..    BTW= If you want everybody to "truly" "start from the same point".. That would be the most socialist thing ever.. Put everybodies assets/money/land etc into a pot.. And distribute equally.. Not very many democrats would support all that..|`|yprHJNHAaa	Yeah...republicans want Exon to report another record breaking year while the people of this country go without food and work!  That is the republican way...it is all about big business....whatever they want!  Give it to them.  And while we're at it...republicans think women should be paid less money...OMG...republicans don't know what fair means.  With Rush Limbaugh at the helm....what a total joke!    Yeah...Dems demoralize the bankers and the cons on wall street that the republicans bailed out.  It is hard work stealing from people and doling out big bonuses for stealing and doing a bad job.      How terrible of the Dems to finally pass a bill for children to have health care...and terrible that the Dems want people to be educated.   Terrible that the Dems want the poor to have work so they can move up to the middle class.  Looking at the voting records of the republicans, it is evident they really don't like the American people...who votes these clowns in....hmm, I bet the uninformed that don't know their voting records. Just like McCain lying about voting for the vets....|`|ia2kz4qyaa	they should talk, the democrats don't play fair on economic stimulus bill by voting no on every republican amendment and whines about 11 democrats didn't voted yes, i am getting a headache after listening to whineocrats whines and whines and whines and i ever wonder how the hell did i wind up being a democrat in the first place?|`|1S0KbHNcaa	Brandon,    I would agree with you in a perfect world. We all know that people are not all given the same chances in life. What I mean is you dont mention that some people discriminate others by keeping them away from good jobs even though they are just as educated or even more educated. you dont mention that alot of wealth is past down from generation to generation and those wealthy children are afforded more oppurtunities in life while the child who is born to poor parents has to deal with bad schools and find a way to make it in life. You dont mention that wealth was made from the backs of slaves who worked hard and didnt get handouts but were forced into labor so that their masters and familys would profit and not them by their hard work and merit as you mentioned. If life was as fair as you see it, I would agree with you 100 % my friend. The reality is everyone who works hard dont always make it in life because of obstacles and good old boy networks. Now I disagree with giving people handouts who dont try to prosper and work hard in life to make something of themselves. I have worked hard all my life and have accomplished alot on my hard work and merit. I have had obstacles, but I went around them. I am a black male male who has never been arrested, have a 4 yr College degree and served the Army for 9 1/2 years. I currently work in law enforcement and have for 14 years. Now with all that said, equal oppurtunity and fairness was not always there in the jobs that I have and had. Race does play a factor alot of times, good old boy networks do also. I guess you would have to live it to understand it from a personal view point. I cant just tell you to give you the perspective of my life and others who work hard, but sometimes looked over because of controversial views by other people. Life will never be fair for everyone, and dont think everybody is not trying hard in life to make it as individuals in life, because there are people who just wont let it happen and dont want it to happen, because they have their own personal fears. Obama becoming President scared alot of people and I am sure you heard alot of racist jokes and comments about Obama. The N-word was use alot and son forth. Look at Obama he worked hard and went to college and so forth, but he is not looked at the same as you, because he is black. He wasnt expected to be an achiever, but he worked hard and did it. My point is that everything is not always what it seems, so dont take what you see in the media and everyday life as face value. You have to walk in the shoes to understand.
QlrIUIfOaa	Because they may pay a higher overall tax rate.    Go for it - can you figure out how that might work? Double dare ya, you betcha!|`|IJTcGIG7aa	I am crying for the the bottom 45% to get a tax cut, and I'm a lot higher up than that.    Cut my taxes, and it goes into savings.   We bank over half of what we make in savings.    What kind of economic stimulus would it be to give money to go right into savings?   nothing.    For a stimulus you need to spend it....and that's why we need to cut all taxes for those just scraping by.   That money will be spent, it will provide the people who need it most with some security and funds to get by.    The fact is.....supply side economics failed.   We need to get back to helping the demand side.   Help out the workers, secure good jobs for this country, and make sure everyone has a safety net to fall on when necessary.    If stability comes at the cost of lower gains, and slower growth......then I'm ready to pay the price.    It's sad that people can only think for themselves.  The root of this economic crash, and supply side economics, Milton Friedman, and Republican economic policy.....is greed.   Greed is what's killing this country.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	A.  I'm not 'crying' about taxes. I simply understand that it will be more difficult to pay taxes....thus, other necessary things will have to give.  B. I do pay taxes. Income tax, car tax, property tax, social security, etc. While I DO get much of it back, I don't get property tax or car taxes back, I don't get state taxes back, I don't get grocery and gas tax back, and what little I get back from federal taxes isn't NEARLY what I gave to them.  C. I am not uneducated. I have 2 degrees, An MDiv from Duke, 2002 and a Doctorate in Philosophy.   D. I have a job.  E. I don't make what you make because I work in a field that doesn't pay much money.....just as our teachers, our firefighters, our soldiers, our police officers, our social workers, etc. do.   F. I am a permanent caregiver for several children who have been abandoned by their parents and who cannot be placed into adoptive homes due to their many difficulties. It doesn't pay much, but it is the best thing I could possibly do with my life. The more I pay in taxes--the less I get back in tax refunds, the less I have to care for these children. Still, I don't 'cry' about it....I just try to change the system...for their sake....as I have all I need.|`|AA10254694	I just read a quote, " Why is it people born on third base think they hit a triple?"

All levels of employment is necessary.  Is it wonderful or glamorous?  No.  But it is there, and it is needed.  You slamming someone because you feel them beneath you is rather immature.    Not everyone working a minimum wage job is "uneducated".  I worked for minimum wage while I got my masters.  Didn't want to, but I had to pull in some income to help out with bills, and I needed a job that would work around my school schedule.  Retail won out on that one.  And now days, there are many unemployed degree holders that are willing to take anything to bring in some money as well as gain some benefits such as health insurance.    You are very shallow and narrow minded.  Conservative, I am guessing.  Really, there is nothing wrong with a conservative ideology, that is until one starts passing judgment over others.    As for your $65K salary - if you have a family of 4, that is not going to get you anywhere.  Food, housing, insurance, vehicles, clothing, utilities,. . .  It all adds up.  And $65K will maybe scrape you by at best.  Again, you are supporting that you are not working or and adult.  Because most adults with families understand that in this day, $65K is not a lot.  It just sounds that way.|`|52cGZS3caa	Dead on arrival - He got it where most of the kiddies get their "facts".

Not everyone can be in the middle or upper class. The bottom 45% of the country DOES pay taxes and they have to get along on much less. Not everyone can go to college, they don't have the brains or the means to do so. Someone has to do the REAL work in the world. What would all you pencil pushers be doing without them ??

How original. LOL  Fact is businesses do in fact pay most of the taxes in this country and they should.  After all it's ultimately paid for by consumers, employees, etc.  However, you can't base it on education for the following reasons:    1.  What about all those Marketing or Phsychology degreed people that are unemployed?    2.  What about all the contractors and builders with no formal education that actually put a roof over your head that make well over six digits?    3.  The human race as a species can easily survive without lawyers and accountants, but it would starve without farmers and die of exposure without construction workers.    Grow up.
X1yZOMYHaa	Because in the year 2008 an estimated 2 people died because of those rocket attacks(not that they're excusable), while upward to 100 or more Palestinians died in Isreal's response.    Look into it. I'm not excusing terrorist attacks. The issue is complicated. But the loss of 1 Israeli civilian isn't worth the loss of 100 Palestinian civilians. And that's been the history.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Well they may have shot this many rockets:    "Fatah's armed wing, the Aksa Martyrs Brigades, announced on Monday that its men in the Gaza Strip fired 102 rockets and 35 mortars at Israel during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip."    but there were closer to 1,000 rockets (guessing here) as last count I saw was 700 and the operation was still in progress    I never said I liked Fatah. To me they just look more moderate compared to Hamas. I  think that Palestinians never had one good leader to represent them *in a peace deal because that's the goal here* and that Arafat smiled so much because he knew he had it rich with lining his pockets with Western money. They're all corrupt and violent to me but then that was the purpose that Syria created them for. All those terrorists suck.|`|3kyLH5Ikaa	Because fatah never fired rockets!    Your stupid on relying on an Israeli news source...  The israeli news even said hamas was using white phosphorus..  white phosphorus??  you know how expensive and hard is find?  Hamas militants are wearing slippers!!!  Jews have F16s and used white phosphorus on the gaza people  look it up!    Israel killed 700 innocent civilians including the UN school and headquarters they bombed.    One school was filled with 50 Palestinian refugees trying to get away and they were shelled by an IDF tank..    what does Israel have to say about that??    "NO COMMENT"      I hope they bring all those IDF generals in charge to justice this week in the Spanish court|`|l9RDuthbaa	Of course Fatah would _claim_ it fought Israel. They want some of the "glory" too.  Anyway, even if true - Hamas is the sole authoritative power in Gaza, and is the one calling the shots (or shooting, if you will).  Israel does not make a difference whether a terrorist takes order from Hamas, Fatah or both, and just like the report says - Israel also killed one of Fatah top commanders in Gaza.|`|NDTLeIUKaa	the jeruselem post.  hahahahahaha.  you almost had me there.

They live in a non reality based world, they  spend enormous amounts of money that they aren't held accountable  for.

I am far far far far far away from being wealthy and am on the down side of middle class, but that doesn' t mean I should take what isn't mine, however, I do pay what I am suppose to.

It doesn't necessarily mean it was road construction however it could have been He might have been hauling a large load and it was for cautionary purposes or maybe he had to go slower at some points and that was to alert other drivers he was there     As far as the cop taking a picture of your plates. He wouldn't do that to send a ticket in the mail to the registered owner of the car. If you were speeding or breaking the law while he was behind you, he'd pull you over right then and there and cite you.     However there are computerized speed contraptions that will take pictures of license plates when detecting a speeder then a ticket gets sent int he mail. But given your question asks if the cop will do that. No.|`|S2FhDtfSaa	Probably had radio communication between the cop and the truck. I imagine they were checking to see if you acted like a drug mule.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Blinking dots are the emergency blinkers, like you have on your car for an emergency.  The truck has to keep those going, since it is subject to stops infrequently or abruptly.
2kZI4KM2aa	If it said it could take up to 24 hours then give it 24 hours. Just because you called 6 hours later and it showed it was 53 dollars available now, doesn't necessarily mean that the computer updated.     Kind of like when a payroll check automatically gets deposited every 2 weeks, on the day deposited it will indicate that amount has been deposited but sometimes it takes 24 hours to actually have the funds available.     But if after 24 hours you still find yourself having that problem. Call the State of Illinois, it could be your card has been damaged.     Good luck, I know that's frustrating.

We get the police we deserve.  If we have a society that expects the police to deal with violent protest, we can expect violent police.  The man who died was unfortunate to find himself between rioting anarchists and rioting protesters.    100 years ago, we'd have used the militia (we call it the TA these days).  A magistrate would have read the Riot Act and anyone who did not leave immediately was then fair game for target practice.  What sort of society do we want?

PQifZodNaa	RLP,      It's not surprising that you are against nature and wildlife and yet you don't have a clue about energy efficiency at all. It's sad that I know more about our state and national parks and about energy efficiency then you. I bet I am younger then you are. I donate my money to the state and national parks, I donate money to kids who have cancers, I don't donate money to corporations that gets a huge tax cut but still cry that they have to pay taxes.     Let Me explain:     850mWildfire prevention in California (Have you not notice how big the wildfire have gotten lately. Anyways, I did a report in criminal justice that terrorist are using wildland fires as terrorists attacks)    400m NOAA to study habitat restoration (It's important to keep the food web from extinction, it goes, humans goes)    600m to NASA for global warming research (It's important to know what is going on with the planet)    150bn to explore alternative energy (We can't depend on Oil and Gas for the rest of our life)    3.1bn for parks and fisheries improvements (Bush ignore the Parks and Fisheries during his 8 years, it's their turn to get cash.)    2.5bn for upgrades and energy efficiency for government run housing (upgrade them and turn them into energy efficient means in the long run less tax dollars is going to them.) It's a Pay Now or Pay later concept, if you didn't take AET at college. You'll never understand it.     6.2bn to weatherize low income homes (Once again, look upgrade them and turn them into energy efficient means in the long run less tax dollars is going to them.) It's a Pay Now or Pay later concept, if you didn't take AET at college. You'll never understand it.    2.4bn for carbon capture technology (That is make sure less CO2 is getting into the Atmosphere)    350 m for std prevention ( Duh, we need this. As you being a female RLP you should know better)    25m for ATV trail maintenance (Yes, that is to prevent wildland fires moving quickly through the state/national parks. Plus, It's easier drive through on them if something happens like a search and rescue needs to be take place)|`|sLEdPDkHaa	im a tax payer first, something the democrats are not|`|zEVpA4WCaa	GET THE FACTS STRAIT BE FOR YOU OPEN MOUTH AND INSERT FOOT RUSH SAID THIS PLAIN WOULD FAIL NOT THAT HE WANTED YOUR ''BOY'' TO FAIL,AND HE'S RIGHT IT WILL FAIL AND THE DEM'S WILL BE BACK FOR MORE..SO COME BACK LATER AND TELL ALL OF US HOW WRONG YOU WERE.

And when Obama said the other day that he wants to immediately create 500,000 government jobs to work on green energy, that is just increasing the size of the government and creating a bigger tax burden on the middle class.    Let the private sector keep more of their profits and they then can reinvest in themselves and that's what creates real goods and services and jobs!    You have very valid points but the problem really lies in the entitlement mentality that has gripped this nation for the last 45 years. Until people start living a life style of personal responsibility and stop looking for a hand out, we will continue to sink into this hole created by class envy!    Lastly, Limbaugh does not want President Obama to fail, but he would like to see Socialist Obama's plans to fail because they would be a death blow for America!|`|H6tfjz8Saa	UHH...

n27iOg3Laa	You make valid points, but you are stretching the radical views of a disproportionate few over what all conservatives think, which is certainly not true. The exact same thing can be said about those on the left. Those close-minded individuals on the left and right who refuse to listen to an opinion other than their own are all cherry pickers. These people only hear what they want to, and if it's not what they want to hear, then the opposition is "ignorant."

Believe me, when it comes to CHERRY picking no one comes close to MSNBC, also known as Democrat campaign headquarters.|`|9hGIaDBkaa	have you watched CNN and MSNBC recently? i didnt think so.....

So help me God."   I gave that oath in 1965.  To this day, to me personally, it is still in effect.  In September of 1965 I wrote a blank check payable to the United States of America for an amount  'up to and inculding my life.'  That check still is available, even though I retired from the U.S. military in November of 1985.|`|AA10382849	They had better start thinking about Mexico|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Are you kidding? They aren't prepared to defend us from ourselves let alone anyone else, but they sure make a nice show of it.

So far they've done a lousy job on that front.|`|Uaci5YXWaa	The Roman Republic fell when Caesar crossed the Rubicon with a Legion and deposed the lawful government.

Obama went to the Republican congressmen and asked them to vote for his plan and opened talks. The House vote also isn't particuarly important in this case, as it's in the Senate where partisanship will stop Obama's stimulus plan, unless he makes some changes to it that the Republicans are demanding.|`|AA10460376	Now that is a good one!.....Good for OBAMA.....|`|158BjrKbaa	Spending like a Drunken Roosevelt/Hoover is getting down to business?|`|VxTYl48Caa	Do you feel like a child?

The republicans have taken a stand for something. When this fails to work, there will be only one party to blame, and that will be the democrats.

Only 1364 days until election day|`|XfhkQwKIaa	Bleated like a true partisan sheep.|`|BsQcplTQaa	Then why is Obama desperate to get Republicans behind his spending bill? And as far as I can see the Country didn't start "screwing up" until we had the misfortune to have Democrats in control of it. I guess you didn't see the connection in 2006 when things started and the Democrats took over. How does it feel Liberal to know that this collapse is solely your fault?

It would be nice if everyone could be a little more tolerant and maybe even a little more openminded :)|`|aVEVchFxaa	No way. Not even close. There are so many good political websites and blogs out there where intelligent adults debate without resorting to name calling. Notice that I said "intelligent adults".

Look, it's not that I disagree with you about the behavior of some people. But that's part of political discussion--and always has been. Our national poltical consciousness didn't grow out of the admittedly brilliant work of the founding fathers. They reflected the society and beliefs around them.    And the endless discussions that were essential to the emergence of American values didn't take place in genteel drawing rooms and refined libraries. They happened in the pubs and taverns of American towns. Complete with insults, name-calling--and not infrequent fights.    Democracy and free speech are noble things. But the nobility comes from the end product--the process can be downright crude and nasty. Get used to it. With the Internet, you are going to see more--and not less. It's a good thing. But democracy--real democracy--is no place for the faint of heart.|`|Oq8G5Cvlaa	Absolutly not!   Too many "sensitive" people on here (Yahoo)   Lose all points you have gained because someone disagrees with you!  Sad but true!|`|cWmx0J4jaa	but still you stay huh?

noo8vpvzaa	How is it ironic when Bush's administration had more minorities in high positions in his cabinet than any other administration in history?    Why are liberals so horribly uninformed?    And how is it "symbolic" when Michael Steele is more qualified for his position, than Obama is for his?...What does that make Obama's position?    I know you liberals have your bias and your prejudicial bigotry, but you guys really just don't make any sense to anyone who doesn't think like you, or believe everything the other members of your party feed you...Sorry.      EDIT: @Jack Bauer: The Republican party has many minorities in high political positions, this isn't a suddenly new thing...Don't liberals ever get embarassed by their lack of knowledge?...Jeez, I'm feeling embarassed FOR you.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	Why wasn't it "ironic" when the Democrats nominated Obama??

Ya know, come to think of it, wasnt that Dr. Kings dream.|`|3OZoLNM2aa	hey  sarah palin was there for ONE reason only     she was a woman to get the hilary voters, they could have also picked a woman and it would have gotten the same response.|`|aVEVchFxaa	Uhh-huh. Very.    ADDITION: To just plain Jim, I always appreciate your comments. They are usually thought out well, and well said and ringing of truth. However, Republicans and Democrats will never, I said never come together. Its just not in the cards man. Like you said, all the hate mongering on the radio talk shows (i.e. Limbaugh and Savage) will help to make that not become a reality. You've got babies right now cutting their teeth on that garbage. They don't really know the first thing about politics. But if they and their little friends hear the hateful Junkie spew anything, they take it as the gospel. Its a very, very, sad state of affairs.|`|m5rkpk1Daa	I've come to realize that all of the problems in the world would be solved if people with the intelligence you possess were relinquished of their right to live.|`|JxYLnTGiaa	Desperation is pathetic.|`|fRCoMzXkaa	You don't understand, according to them, he was absolutely the most qualified person for the job. It's just a coincidence that the GOP is almost entirely white (thus, making it odds-defying) and it comes right on the heels of the country inaugurating its first black President. No, really, it's just all a happy coincidence.    Edit: lol@Romey (below) That's what you guys said about Palin! That's funny!|`|O1Unx5RUaa	Not ironic, just a lame attempt by the repubs.   What happened to Condi?   They have a new token now.|`|Ebqz6NhXaa	I call it a Blackwash. they aren't really making any changes to the GOP they are just hoping a black face will make them more appealing. it is exactly like what was done with sarah palin and women.    say gregory why is it log cabin republicans are called that? is it because the republican base is against homosexuals? are there any proud gay elected republicans?   what a confusing situation.|`|AA10652652	MLK was a Republican. Yes there are homosexual Republicans, look for the Log Cabin Republicans.  Blacks and homosexuals don't like paying high taxes either.  Part of the problem is that Republicans aren't seen as a big tent political party.|`|AA10317675	It may seem that way to some.  It seems many have bought into the myth that Republicans all have white hooded robes in their closets.    But that is not true.     Yes, there are bigots in the Republican party, but there certainly are bigots in the Democrat party.|`|AA10578159	I think its rather nice, at least he is one black man that doesn't tell the black people they are to stupid to make some thing of their life like so many other black men do and that whitey is holding them down and that is why they shouldn't even try, I think he was a good choice.|`|64SObnr5aa	8 years ago, the Neocons were marching in victory, claiming the end of liberalism and the dawn of a new and prosperous age were life would be perfect and ever lasting.    Just like Hitler said with his 1,000 year Riech.  12 years later it layed in ashes with millions dead and an uncertain future for millions more.    Sound eerily familiar?    The lesson here, never say never, never say forever, everything changes, nothing stays the same.    This man you are bemoaning about could be the person that gets the GOP back on track and back to its roots and center, and away from the mangy mutts of neoconism and fanaticalism. While I am a liberal, I am not a partisan and I would welcome that.  We can not govern effectively through divisive politics, it has proven to be extremely damaging to our country.   I really do not think we would be in this economic mess today if both sides could have worked together intelligently.  But the hate mongers on talk radio over the last two decades have all but erased a common sense approach to governing.    Today, we can only hope.    That is not much to go on, now is it?    Peace  Jim    .|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	i just think they are trying to use him to go against obama
AA10317675	I liked McCain because he is socially moderate & fiscally conservative.    I tolerated him kissing up to the religous right but when he picked Palin as his running mate, he lost my support.    But I couldn't vote for Obama either because of his fiscally liberal views.  So I voted Libertarian for the first time this year!`|`|AA11702773	Because Ron Paul is a strict constitutionalist with a 20 year proven record of having fought for the individual and against special interests.  He walks the walk.|`|35ZJauLkaa	I research Obama thoroughly, McCain was nominated so we had limited choices. Romney would have beat him.|`|JthubNIsaa	I voted for McCain against Obama. Now we are all stuck with him and all the crooks who work for him.|`|3DOQG6hEaa	Because I saw too many similarities in what McCain was doing, and that he would likely, more or less, continue the course that Bush was on... this became even more obviously a bad idea when the economy started failing. Obama is a clearly different type of person and different type of politician from Bush, and for better or worse, we certainly need that. It is a somewhat risky proposition to support a guy with so little experience, but I preferred him to Hillary and the other Democratic candidates because he was so clearly different from the rest of the field. I think he's already showing that with bold initiatives and the shutting down of Guantanamo..  he's done quite a bit, and different things than most Presidents, already.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	I supported the Republican so that our fine Law Enforcement wouldn't have to put up with punk libs, like the one in this video:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CZu6nRRs...    Hopefully, the traitor's jaw was broken.  If you don't like America, you can leave.  Protesting is unpatriotic.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	Ron Paul because he was the only politician that cared for Americans.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	Bob Barr? Lesser of all evils and he's against the income tax|`|hdcLCk8Faa	Obama stood for and stands for nothing but himself. He threw his Pastor, Real Estate buddy and even his Grandmother under the bus just for his own political gain. That is someone who cannot be trusted at all--period.    Voted for McCain as Obama tells nothing but lies for personal gain.|`|m5rkpk1Daa	For the same reason I supported what I've always supported in terms of how much support I'm actually willing to give for that which I will always support supposing that I have in fact ever really supported anything that could be supported in the first place in which support actually can and might support something I believe should have been supported when support was never given while I was busy supporting something else that no one else really supported and I never really supported but more or less pretended to support because that's where I figured the supporting was needed.|`|60YMS1xkaa	Ron Paul.

Every other reason is secondary.|`|ghljQhGIaa	i simply cannot bring myself to support someone who supports the murder of unborn children,wants to take my right to own a personal self defense weapon,who wants to tax me unmercifully while looking the other way when it comes to his super rich and elitist friends which is pure hypocrisy!  it's simple really  it all boils down to common sense vote for whats right or whats wrong!!|`|O5DZvc0Xaa	I voted for Chuck Baldwin... mainly because Ron Paul dropped out and endorsed Baldwin, and also because I figured that (assuming my electronic vote was actually counted) any vote for the CONSTITUTION Party would send a clear message: (call me crazy but) "I want to KEEP the Bill of Rights."    But I don't place as much importance on Presidential elections as I do on STATE AND LOCAL ONES!!!    (2010 baby)

I wouldn't put it past them !! They are soo confused and disorientated,,by their election losses,, they don't know how to act or proceed from this point !!

You know a good choice was made when the libs start attacking immediately.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	He is a very established politician with many credentials, unlike Obama, Michael Steele actually has experience, I am very pleased.|`|U1pMvDvgaa	Michael Steel will make a good RNC leader, he is conservative so he will not be worshipped as a God. The freeloaders will not like him at all.|`|CdBdP2ymaa	He will do just fine.  Great republican.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I think that he may steer the party to more moderate views.  He's moderate on abortion, favors affirmative action and opposes the death penalty.  For those who want a moderate, he's great.  For those who want a more conservative party, it may be time to look for another party.  http://www.issues2000.org/Senate/Michael...|`|ZxtEh7yZaa	I HOPE but he will be ripped apart by the MSM he has to much integrity...|`|YIWKPXokaa	It's their choice.

What a new and novel idea.......|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	He is great, I am so glad he is the RNC leader!|`|aGNjZmyJaa	I think its sad how the GOP is using him as a tool.

Hmmmmm..........stay tuned.|`|6aUcnuaDaa	Good leader He will be great for the party.|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	No, he is a token filler candidate that they wanted to elect so they wouldn't look like backwater racists.

Republicans sold out, stooping to the Dems' level with this black "token" guy.|`|1P5qWMQ0aa	The thing is, Steele doesn't have a shady past or any doubt surrounding him.  He happens to be a great American who leads conservatives and Republicans alike.  Obama was under the rug throughout his political career.  When he arose, people flocked to him because of what he preached.  Steele doesn't need to preach anything, he knows what to say and can back it up.  Something Obama hasn't and can not do.|`|EULVtVDvaa	As a Republican and I'M NOT RACIST . I am very happy that Michael is the leader of RNC .

He really puts his money where his mouth is.|`|AA10317675	Michael Steele comes across as a very levelheaded man.    He is too far right on social issues for me so he won't quite win be back from the Libertarian party, but I think this is a great move for the Repblican party.      Obama's charisma was not based on his race.|`|aOlqwfgzaa	He was a strategic choice. I also doubt he will have the Obama effect.|`|jsCe1eHgaa	He's an excellent choice and a true leader. He's exemplifies the fact that the GOP is not a "good ol boys club" of just rich, old white men. The libe-crats can't handle this shock, so in their typically juvenile fashion, they label him as a token. It's beyond pathetic.|`|ouEix2a2aa	Michael Steele is a good man because he's "BLACK".  He's just a "face" for the RNC as a hopeful individual to bring more BLACKS into the Republican arena.  It is not surprising at all that the GOP would exploit someone for a pony show. Look at what they did to Sarah Palin. There needs to be some serious policy regrouping and strategizing rather than putting puppets in place.|`|34Jy94WLaa	Michael Steele is indeed the token black of the Republican Party and their choice is an insult to Black people. The greater part of the Black community will not vote Republican just because the majority white party finally decided to give a Black man a position.

One felony is bad enough...two is mission impossible. You can still try if they are willing to do the paper work, but don't hold your breath.    It is very rare to enlist with a GED. Most branches only let 5% of their enlistees to be GED holders. But there is good news. If you have 15 college credits under your belt then it would be like having a diploma and your chances of getting in would be far greater.     A GED plus two felony convictions....your chances of getting waivers are worse than crashing your car then  falling off a cliff then getting run over by escaped elephants from the circus then being struck by lighting three times all in succession. Not good odds, but try if you want.    "Most likely youll have to be infantry, but its a start."    You act like that's a bad thing SSgt. I wouldn't trade it for any other MOS.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	I don't know what your drug charge is for but if your drug felony is for distribution (selling drugs) then you are PERMANENTLY disqualified and even the two-star USAREC commander can't waive that.  The only way he could waive it is if you did it while a juvenile and showed meritorious improvement since and there was a gap of at least five years from the offense.  If you think the recruiter is lying to you then look in the AR 601-210, Chapter 4.  It tells the offenses that can and cannot be waived.  The regulation constantly gets updated, so you might not be able to pull up the most recent version.  But I can ensure you that the recruiter has the most recent version because his career depends on it.|`|q3E1ouQvaa	DUDE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY OBAMAS CIVILIAN NATIONAL SECURITY FORCE    IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE A PERFECT FIT LOL    DONT WORRY YOU WILL NOT NEED A GED JUST BLIND OBEDIENCE AND STARRY EYED WORSHIPFULNESS|`|3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	Here is the real reason why you got turned away.     It is a combination of not being a high school grad and the two felonies. A drug felony is usually given if it is drug trafficking. The military will not accept those under any circumstances. So if you have that GTA and no high school diploma then you are defintely a no go.    You won't be able to try another recruiter because they all go by the same standards. They operate under a manual that tells them what they can and cannot put in to the service.    I think it is good that you want to turn your life around. And I wish you good luck with that. I would also look into getting your record expunged. That may not help with getting into the service but it will help you later on. Get your GED and go to college.|`|SvMJ5b6aaa	well if the Army isn't having trouble filling it's number for "Bodies" they tend to not do a lot of waivers and you at least have to have a GED that is nonwavierable. get your ged and try again|`|cekZba0Uaa	Sorry bro, Felony is maybe if you can get a waiver and your recruiter is down on numbers, double felony, especially one with drugs is a no go.|`|203084e5ea553346cdd3577aa2818652aa	Try a run for Senate. Less picky.|`|kwYxQp0Maa	Recruiters don't usually turn people away if they can get them in.  Double felonies and drugs...no way.  The standards were relaxed but not for felony drug offenses and probably not for GTA either.  Otherwise a GED would do.|`|UHBbSeesaa	SSgt Budz.......      Well my friend,  first of all get your Sh*t together.  Get a GED.     The Marines will skip over your felonies ect.    You can try different recruiters, they are like evry other job, some try harder.  They don't network so go ahead and contact as many as you can.     Most likely youll have to be infantry, but its a start.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Why are you SHOUTING? It pisses people off.    You missed your chance by a few years. Back when Bush was just starting his Attila the Hun impression and invading foreign countries using planted and imaginary evidence, you would have been welcomed with open arms. They wanted people like you then, as evidenced by the constant stream of atrocities from serving troops.     Now, with the beginning of a properly constituted American government run by a President who actually did get voted in, people like you are destined for prison life.  As you should be.|`|KxxSxznLaa	I think for some felonies you can get a waiver if your recruiter's numbers are low.  However a double felony is probably stretching it a bit.  Sorry|`|AA12151645	If you'd done those things and were now straight headed, off drugs etc. you would probably be headhunted to become a spook.    If you try around with other recruiters they may feel you are committed to wanting to join up. If they think you are a problem child that will get other guys killed, they will f*** you off asap - and rightly so.    The next time you approach a recruiter, make sure you are smartly dressed, wide awake and have had a long think about the impact of the things you have done to other people. And don't take any drugs for the rest of your life.

I don't mean when Mathews in on Hardball that is a commentary show so his personal opinion is ok. I watch a lot of news and then decide for myself.  How is it unfair? ABC, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, HNN, CNBC, Times, Post...All mainstream and conservative viewpoint - FOX - let's just say they sure couldn't ride a seesaw together.    Oh and I forgot Rassmussen sp? did a poll that showed fox did equal numbers of positive and negative stories on each candidate during the election while all the other stations were extraordinarily one sided.|`|6e2e969f5e5cce0eaddf9277cc12edd1aa	Why didn't the libs put this in their papers before the election?|`|EULVtVDvaa	Your afraid of Glenn and its NOT " Glen " - he's a straight shooter .

AA12215630	Depends on what branch she is in:    Army: 6 months deferment-from-deployment policy (the army use to have a 4 month policy but changed it in August 2008)    Marines: 6 months deferment-from-deployment policy    Navy: 12 months deferment-from-deployment policy    Air Force: 4 months deferment-from-deployment policy    Now they do get 42 days Maternity Leave once the baby is born.|`|q3E1ouQvaa	It truly saddens me that this question even has to be asked.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Each service has a minimum amount of time a woman must wait before deploying after giving birth.  The Army, for example, requires a minimum of four months after giving birth before the woman can deploy.  The Soldier can request a waiver to deploy earlier if she wishes but it has to be approved before they will let her go.    EDIT: I see it is six months now thanks to the poster below.|`|nfXbqCgZaa	You are placed on convalescent leave, usually 6 weeks.  She would then have to set up some plan for care of the child before she was deployed.|`|xpvFbcJqaa	I'm not sure what the other branches policies are but from my own personal experience I got 6 months.|`|hJNwAHccaa	Back in 2003, I was non-deployable for 4 months postpartum.  At my 4 month mark, I deployed.  Nowadays, I hear the Army changed it to 6 months although the Regs still say 4 months.  If you have a kind unit CDR you might get lucky and be able to stay home.    Keep in mind that you have 6 months to get back in shape and believe me, they might give you an APFT the day after your profile is over.

The depression occurred under Hoover, who chose to do little intervention thinking the free market principles would save the economy... it didn't.    FDR came into power... and it's disputable whether his "New Deal" or WW2 turned around the economy, but the bottom line is... public works spending did guide the US economy out of it's depression.    There's a reason Dick Cheney warned republicans, "do you want to be the next Herbert Hoover?" when it came to the original Wall-Street bailout... he was saying, "do you want to be the party that makes things worse by doing nothing?".|`|i0vcEyJtaa	They won't work. Actually, Hoover WAS trying to avoid a recession, he intervened in the market, and tried to maximize government spending, he did. BUT, he left this mess under FDR, which FDR only prolonged it, he made it worse when he started to regulate the free market, unbalanced the budgets, increases government spending (just like Obama), and created disastrous bureaucracy by creating more government jobs and Social Security, this only accelerated the pace for inflation, more debt, and later the Depression.    It was Capitalism that brought us out of a depression, WW2 only stimulated the economy temporarilty, but Keynesian economics was starting to form in the government, nothing but constant regulation, and more government intervention is what slowed down the economy. Throwing more money at the problem won't work, it is like adding more fuel to a raging fire.|`|nfXbqCgZaa	Historians will differ as to what exactly made the great depression happen, but the fact of the matter is, the Great Depression didn't really happen until several years after the crash of 1929.  It was really in 1933, that the sh*t hit the fan.    Some of the trouble was caused by protectionist policies on the part of Hoover that drove up interest rates and actually contracted spending and dried up credit.     Right now, you have an economy in which the credit has frozen.  All these bailouts and massive spending is the exact opposite of what happened in the early days of the Great Depression.  The Fed is trying to unfreeze the credit markets by throwing money at it.    Whether it was the New Deal or World War II that brought us out of the depression, I don't know.  But the economy was already recovering long before the United States entered the war.  Obviously, we were preparing for war and the government was helping England fight the Nazi's.|`|0683ccd6412eda6bd75ac2f24a0c357aaa	Because the liberal mind hasn't had an original thought, ever.

AA11494150	Traffic laws are "strict liability". This means knowledge of the violation does not need to be established. You are responsible for the condition of your car.     However, the judge has a lot of discretion. Get it fixed, get a receipt, and show it to the judge.

In and out in a couple of seconds, probably won't cost you the full ticket price.    In Upstate NY that would be a "fix-it" ticket ... get the bulb changed and drop by the local police station so that they can confirm the fix.

WJDJ2vIoaa	There is nothing wrong with being an MP.  I guarantee it will open big doors for you if you only do your initial committment then get out.  Your score on ASVAB isn't too bad, but it's also not in the top 1%.  Top 1% would be to score 100%, sorry.  It depends too on how many people enlisted at the time of your enlistment and what the percentages were for the ASVAB test at the time of your enlistment.  If you are in a pool where you scored at the top 1% even if your score isn't a 100%, you might be able to change MOS.      If you were to change MOS, my next recommendation would be MI, or Military Intelligence.  If you were to go MI, you could specialize in a variety of areas, like counterintelligence, espionage, investigations, etc.  You would most likely do active duty overseas for at least one year tour.  If you could choose, look at either Germany or Korea. Same as MP though.. Either MOS will open doors.  With MI, you could also spend the next year or two of active duty in CONUS, learning a language or two, and then getting into the espionage and counterintelligence areas.    Check your recruiter too.  The bonus is a nice thing to have as a reservist too.  But, if you get out of the Army, you have only a certain time to spend it.  Keep that in mind, also keep in mind the GI Bill and use it.  Depending on which area you intend on getting into for your civilian career, once you get into the reserves, I recommend you apply for a federal government job.  There are many programs available to government employees in certain fields, like Information Technology (INFOSEC) stuff.. where the govt will pay 100% tuition reimbursement if you are enrolled in a fulltime or even partime studies.  Take that into consideration as well.  You can search the web for govt jobs, but better to stay with usajobs.gov.      You will also get a clearance level in the reserves, even if you are an enlisted.  Most likely get secret clearance. A clearance can open up many doors for government work as well.  The government employment is the most stable right now.    I hope I didn't go too far off track either and hope some of this information helps you.  Good luck, be safe, and enjoy whatever you do.  I am a former Army MI Officer, being out for several years as a Major.  Enjoyed my time in and hope you do as well.|`|uojIfxaoaa	Yes you can my friend talk your recruiter.|`|xpvFbcJqaa	If you are sucessful at changing your MOS then your enlistment bonus may be different if you get any at all.    I hope you learned your lesson to do your homework, with an ASVAB score of 95 you could have pretty much picked any MOS you desired.|`|cekZba0Uaa	I'd recommend sticking with MP, you won't regret it.  Talk to your recruiter about switching MOS's before bootcamp, I did and got screwed over and hate my job now.  You also might lose you bonus if you switch jobs.  My advice is stick with MP, you won't regret it.|`|VOyzSjEuaa	You are correct that 99% is the highest.. Good for you!  But, you still missed a perfect score.  Ritz probably was thinking of 99%.  I blame his age for forgetting; we have been longtime friends in the Armed forces and shared many tours together in our military careers.    It's too bad you didn't prep for the exam.  Bear this in mind, when you do come aboard, you will need to prepare yourself for further testing in whichever speciality you choose to go into.  If you go MI, plan on prepping quite a bit.  Having been a former Army MI E9 (CSM), I have seen soldiers fail by not prepping properly.  I did my 30, then got out and recently went back in as a Warrant.  Spent some time overseas to continue my service and am glad to have done it.  I am sure you will be happy as well.    There is nothing wrong with having chosen MP, but if you can do it, which I am sure you are if you are determined to make a change, look at the Military Intelligence MOS.  If you're a smart guy, and I have a hunch you are, I think you will enjoy it and have a great career.  If you've done so well, you might also look to go active, rather than reserves too.  An active duty career has many more rewards.   Ask your recruiter for help.    Good luck.  Study hard and excel.  It's better to be at the very top of the list than just getting by or being close.  Wouldn't you prefer to be at the top anyway?      Be safe where ever you go.  Remember to listen to the old farts who have been around for a long time because we are the ones who know what we're talking about.  Most of us who have been in for 25+ years have served in at least two wars.  I served in Hondorus in 89, the Gulf War in 90-92, then a few other places here and there, then back to the sand pit for four more tours.

Lies   180-181 ---and this is in just 1a days--the lieOmeter will burn up at this pace.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	Don't forget Janet Napolitano, who covered up for a brutal Sheriff in AZ.    [Sheriff] Arpaio didn't order the murder of Scott Norberg, but he was deeply involved in the cover-up. "Notes taken the night of the killing were destroyed," writes Phoenix New Times' Michael Lacey. "Critical X-Rays were destroyed. County authorities, under the watchful eye of the sheriff, hid the fact that Norberg's larynx was fractured." What evidence did exist was forwarded to the FBI. The Norberg family's attorney, Michael Manning, provided Napolitano  by way of her assistant US attorneys  with much of the evidence that had been suppressed by the MCSO.     And that's where the case died.    Before the investigation found traction, Napolitano was dismissive of Arpaio's critics, insisting that he ran "a strict jail but a safe one."    The Justice Department's final report, which was issued two years after Napolitano punted on the issue, fleshed out the skeletal term "strict" in interesting ways, noting that excessive and abusive use of force was common and often involved unjustified use of restraint chairs, hog-tying and beating of inmates, and other forms of deadly restraint.    The report likewise scored Arpaio's staffing decisions, which left the jail "below levels needed for safety and human operations." The Justice Department, as former Arizona Republic reporter Tom Zoellner pointed out in Slate, "filed suit and settled with the sheriff the same day" in exchange for promises of various reforms.    Napolitano was at Arpaio's side when the sheriff called a press conference to call the settlement a personal vindication. Napolitano, recall, had been handed clear evidence of murder committed under Arpaio's authority, and a criminal conspiracy led by his office cover up that crime; she simply threw it out and refused to prosecute.    --    Lie-O-meter, lol.

DAMZKbpDaa	If you call your state's child welfare, or department of families and children, or whatever your state calls it, you may (or may not) be put into foster care. But not emancipated.    To be emancipated, you need a court order, you need to convince a judge you can basically care for yourself on your own, make your own money, support yourself, etc.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Probably not, abuse (if that is what it was) generally gets the parents into trouble and the child off to foster care (or in another family members care).|`|AA11950233	that isn't what it means.     But being hit is probably enough to be placed in foster care.|`|nbibIzC5aa	No but you have a case for child abuse.  Emancipation means that you are able to support yourself without the help of anyone else.  Usually a child becomes emancipated with the help of their parents or through an underage marriage.|`|AA11401784	If you were hit with like a leg from a table, you were assaulted.     However, the two (assault and emancipation) are not related.     In order to be an emancipated child, the court has to see several things: first, there there is a compelling reason for you to no longer need parental guidance and control; second, that you have the means to live alone (you are making enough money to pay rent, utilities, insurance, transportation, groceries, etc); and third, that you have the maturity to live outside of the parents' home.     All of this would happen at a court hearing where you would have to testify in front of the court and your parents why you want to be emancipated.     Just as an FYI, the court generally grants emancipation to kids who are movie stars or musicians making millions of dollars and who can afford good lawyers.    - Stuart|`|d744df703c1bbfc38519fcf12e361265aa	You're really talking about two separate issues.    If you're being beaten by your parents with the leg of a table, then it needs to be reported as soon as possible, while the injury is still visible, to child protective services.  That will start the process of removing you from your parents' care and placing you in a foster placement... with relatives if that is possible/appropriate, or with a foster family.  It does NOT start or bring about emancipation.    Emancipation is a completely different process by which you apply to the juvenile Court to declare yourself an emancipated minor.  In order to show you meet the requirements to be emancipated, there's a long list of things you have to be able to do.. including provide shelter, food, and clothing for yourself, and you have to be working and/or going to school.  The process of emancipation takes six months or more... so if you're even close to 17, it's just not worth it.      If you are injured from the abuse, you need to notify the authorities.|`|0683ccd6412eda6bd75ac2f24a0c357aaa	Try listening to your parents. Then maybe you won't be disciplined.|`|lGRnkbqnaa	Wait, your parents hit you with a piece of furniture?    That is some major child abuse, and I would say you definitely can get away from them, either in foster care of emancipation.|`|Pi4R6tINaa	Well listen to my logic:  The Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves  So if you are a slave that was hit by a gravity defying table leg then yes you can emancipate or whatever.|`|0szdSHHkaa	it's going to depend on the context (how/why )|`|9Miqe8Z6aa	No, that will not get you emancipated. Abuse would have to be happening and seen by witnesses  multiple times before it would even open a case for child protective services. I know it sounds screwed but any child can yell abuse if they are mad. Even if you were taken away for abuse it wouldnt be emancipation. You would me moved to a foster home or something of similar nature. You can try to be emancipated but the only ways if you are under age is to get married, join the military or try to take it to court. Your parents can either accept it or go against you in court. And sorry hunny, unless you got some major proof that you can support yourself or be accepted into a family that can financially support, or that is is not right for you to be living at home then you will most likely get denied. It is not that easy to just be emancipated sorry.
qwaWd14vaa	14th Amendment:  "Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without the due process of law; nor deny any person within it's jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."   Many states have a policy about the use of force Incorporated into the statutes. This is called the "USE OF FORCE CONTIUUM" The force esculates as the victim keeps agression going and non compliance.  1. Physical Presence  2. Soft Handed Tactics  3. Mace / Pepper Sprays  4. Hard Hand Tactics  5. Baton / Taser  6. Threat of Deadly Force  7. Deadly Force   These steps in progression to resistance esculate to possible death. It is when the suspect gives up and force at the next higher level is used when unwarranted, that brutality or excessive force can be brought as a charge.

rMDHNPnEaa	I'm not a woman police officer, but I was in the military and military women get asked the same types of questions (similar).    1. Is any of the safety or protective equipment harder to work with because of your size?     (some of the military equipment was too big for some women...they didn't always have smaller sizes for us.)  2. Do you feel like the men in your department respect you?  3. Do you have more trouble with men you arrest or women you arrest. (as a military woman I was resented by some civilian women)  4, How do women compare to men on the firring range?  5. Are women better negotiators? Do women really listen better than men?  6. Are women better than men when it comes to kids/babies?  7. Are larger men suspects more likely to take advantage of a woman cop?  8. How do men and women compare on written tests?  9. Do women feel more threatened by driving alone at night or stopping someone when she is alone?  10. In cases where sex crimes are committed with women victims are women better at getting information to help catch the bad guy? or vice verse  11. Do wives and girl friends of male policemen resent women working with their men. (this came up a lot with military)  12. Can using your brain make up for what physical strength you have? or can physical stength make up for when logic is needed. (brains vs. brawns)|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	I would ask if they are taken seriously by law breakers. Like speeders. And if they feel that their size might be a problem.

The Soviet Union developed theirs in 1949, followed by the UK in 1952, then France in 1960 and China in 1964. Israel, North Korea, India, Pakistan and South Africa have also all tested nuclear weapons, although South Africa later dismantled theirs in the run up to the end of apartheid.|`|LWzrCu5caa	After WW II the new USAF saw atomic weapons as bigger,  better bombs.   They wanted to use them in conventional warfare to achieve their goal of strategic wins in a conventional war.  After all,  it worked in Japan when conventional bombing in Germany did not.    The US Navy on the other hand saw nuclear weapons as a whole new ball game.  They said that once you started throwing nukes around,  the winner would be as bad off as the losers.   They came up with the idea of using nuclear weapons to deter war.   The idea they presented is that with nuclear weapons,  if any enemy attacked the USA with nuclear weapons, we would wipe them out,  just as they would wipe us out.   No one would win.   And that would likely keep any future wars on the conventional level.        The Navy view was not without some self serving reasons.  If the USAF got its way and nuclear weapons were to be bigger better bombs,  the power of the US military would lay with the USAF.  The Navy did not want that.  It wanted to maintain its status and to do so,  it had to down play the importance of nuclear weapons in conventional war.   It got what it wanted.    First Truman then Eisenhower went with the idea of deterrence.   And the concept of MAD came about.  The USA targets Russian cities as part of the program,  a counter value targeting system.   It was clearly a deterrent philosophy,   because if you were planning on a first strike use of nukes, you would target the enemy's military forces.   (Counter force.)       The idea of using nukes for anything else other than deterrence held up during the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson,  Nixon, and Ford Administrations.   Nuclear weapons were only to be used for deterrence.   Yes, the Army did experiment with an Atomic Cannon but that idea was given up pretty fast.       Then along comes Carter.  He had a problem with targeting cities.  So he change the targeting to military targets.   The Russians had a fit.  That is the kind of targeting you do if you are planning a first strike.   More importantly it changed the thinking about nukes.   Away from MAD and to possible use for other stuff.       Along came Reagan and he gave the go ahead for the Neutron Bomb.  A clearly military use of nukes in a tactical situation.      Today,  we have gone back to the USAF thinking in many cases.  How to handle Iran?  Use a B61-11 nuclear bunker buster to take out their nuclear assets.   We have moved away from MAD to actually thinking about using nukes in a situation other than MAD.    And this thinking has also impacted other nations.   If the USA is thinking of using nukes in a non-MAD situation,  then so are they.  India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, all have nukes and if push comes to shove,  they will use them in either a tactical or strategic manner.    Thank Carter.....who took us away from MAD and got us thinking about using nukes for other stuff.|`|QyyCnPBDaa	the strategies were all part of the u.s. Strategic Air Command, established in 1946, and disbanded in 1992. The sac controlled all of the us nuclear bombers, and intercontinental ballistic missles. it was, and is, all about peace through superior firepower, which is what deterrence is pretty much defined as. look up "mutually assured destruction" it will tell you alot.   it has recently come to light that the soviet union didn't have enough nuclear weapons to pose a serious threat to the united states until the late 1950's. not because they didn't have the warheads, but because they didn't know how to deliver them through our defenses.
qwaWd14vaa	Depending on the reporting system.

They will always know. Do u plan on breaking probation? thats dumb! But even if not city cops and county cops all have the same system. You cant hide from them.|`|cUYunFvHaa	yes immediatly they will as long as its in ur state, if u have a warrent or on probation in texas but roll to cali the police here wont know squat unless its more than a misdemeanor!|`|vwoqIUR6aa	yes they can....they can in canada as well|`|ve0sWDThaa	NO!!|`|c07v7O80aa	Boy! What a bunch of pretending to know the answer!    Here's the real deal. They won't be driving around with a list of probationers. IF your criminal history is up to date, it will show the dispositions of the convictions. So, it will show up there. But it's not a thing you routinely ask dispatch to look at. Those officers with in-car terminals who run a complete RAP will see it. Mostly, they will run a plain history, and in Texas that will be just a kind of box score of how many arrests and convictions for each offense. So someone is going to have to make at least some effort to see the detailed history.     So, yes, they CAN tell, if they want to know, but on most contacts, they won't be looking that deep. There is no difference between what state troopers see and what any other officer sees. It's all the same system and always has been.     The only difference it might make to see that you were on probation is that, if you were being arrested, they might notify the probation office the next day if they wanted to speed up your revocation. There's no "flag" or alert attached to your drivers license record or your criminal history, except for the disposition record.    And in Texas, being on probation does not mean you get searched or checked or handled in any way different than anyone else during a contact. And no one can arrest you for a non-crime that happens to be a probation violation until the court issues a MRP warrant.|`|QD657jWeaa	they can tell if you're black gay muslim or british.|`|npTKwgDcaa	if they run your name they can tell if you have warrants or if you are on probation.|`|E7GwqMotaa	befor only trooper could but now days any cop can know everything on everything all is one system now|`|t93uTYK0aa	Yes, your in the system.|`|KfafY2YQaa	yes, they most definitly can. when they ask you for your drivers liscense or id, then will enter the number in there computer inside their car. it will then bring up your crinimal history, warrants, and if you are or not on probation. if you are on probation, they have the ability to search you, your car, house, and belongings for anything that violates the probation|`|xzEPg0afaa	i dont know.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Yes, they can.

If you don't know what that means, then either hire a lawyer or talk to your local child support enforcement agency.|`|yB4o9YD2aa	Why does your son's dad only support his child's back? That doesn't make any sense. Did you mean "black" child?|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	he can file all he wants to but until all monies owed are paid, the court will NOT release him from his obligation to pay.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	Great, it gives you an opportunity to file a counter-motion for contempt of court, and request that the deadbeat be jailed for a while.   In Texas he could be put in jail for up to 6 months for each month he is in arrears.  Typically they ask for the deadbeat to be placed on probation and they don't ever go to jail unless the child support becomes more in arrears because of failure to pay.    It would probably be worth the money to have an attorney represent you, an ask the court to make him pay the cost of the attorney you hire.    Is he using an attorney?  If he is the court will not look kindly on one who should be using all hie extra money to support his child spending his disposable income on an attorney to try to reduce the debt.    Unless, is he filing because you no longer have the child with you?  Is the child over 18 and out of school?  Is there some other reason he might not be required to continue to pay?  Has he had a substantial change in his income since the support was ordered so that it is not fair for him to continue to pay that amount?    If there is no reason he should be relieved of the obligation don't worry, just hire an attorney.    Good Luck|`|AA11206283	uh....you are probably playing with enough money to make hiring a lawyer a good idea.

She appealed her conviction on the basis of freedom of expression.         Question Presented   Were the confiscated materials protected by the First Amendment? (May evidence obtained through a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment be admitted in a state criminal proceeding?)         Conclusion   The Court brushed aside the First Amendment issue and declared that "all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by [the Fourth Amendment], inadmissible in a state court." Mapp had been convicted on the basis of illegally obtained evidence. This was an historic -- and controversial -- decision. It placed the requirement of excluding illegally obtained evidence from court at all levels of the government. The decision launched the Court on a troubled course of determining how and when to apply the exclusionary rule.|`|e92e869e98edcf7e6af91bc36e193cc3aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapp_v._Ohi...

But it isn't necessary for a few to have vast wealth while many lack necessities. When this is the case, it's time for social restructuring. The problem isn't with individuals lacking skills or industy, it's a problem with the way work is rewarded, the way necessities are aquired. We have examples before us of nations and cultures, past and present, where very few people suffer want. So this is basically FALSE.|`|fa375ee02eb08d0015f7d75ef46a8890aa	There will always be people who are less fortunate in a society.  The only way to wipe out poverty is to make the majority of its citizens productive in the workplace.  You cannot have social welfare programs that reward people for being lazy.  When you get unemployment to less than 3 percent, then poverty will lessen.  The only people that should be helped are those who can't physically help themselves.  Do away with the incentive to not work and you will see less poverty.  The democrats have no interest in doing away with this in America because they can keep making promises to this group that they never keep and retain them as voters to keep them in power.|`|b24a4a82d11ba046adf9cfdd549a7db0aa	That is so true!

If someone erase the bottom of this pyramid, then you will have another bottom.|`|AA10783295	It's a false dilemma, and the statement can't be evaluated in purely True/False terms. Poverty itself is a relative term, and it implies a comparison to a somewhat arbitrarily defined standard of living. What we call poverty in this country is defined by an index of income to family size. Elsewhere in the world, there are people who live in conditions far, far worse, who are also considered to be living in poverty. They are lucky to have toilets, running water, access to education, etc. The real problem with the concept is trying to come up with a calculation of how all available resources should be distributed between people - there has to be some kind of system for determining that distribution - for the moment, capitalism through a constrained free market seems to be the best idea going, in which case "poverty" is probably an inescapable reality to some degree. From there, the question (in my mind) is how do we choose constrain the free markets to forcibly redistribute wealth to mitigate the problem. Some form of social assistance, charity, welfare, etc.|`|AA12198371	Though it is hard to believe, development can improve the overall wealth of the world; with more to spread around it is possible to reduce poverty without going broke yourself.    One way people think about the economy is like a poker game: people sit around a table and push money back and forth with the total amount of money not changing.  This is a false view of the world as there is always wealth creation (and destruction) with the net wealth of the world steadily increasing.    I would also say that less poverty does not necessarily lead to inflation (price increases).  When you go to a grocery store or a Wal-Mart, you can see that prices on most of the necessities (other than energy) have not changed much in the last 20 years.  Even energy, which is expensive, has not changed materially in cost from the 70s, when computed as a percent of peoples salaries.
