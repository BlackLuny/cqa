20090222164409AAycmqY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I tell her how I feel or just keep my mouth closed? This weekend, my 2 friends of 15 years came to?	my home for the first time since I moved about 4 years ago. They stayed here in my house, but a few days before they arrived they informed me that there were some guys coming here from another city to meet them also. I was stunned, but said nothing. The whole weekend, with exception of shopping on Friday 2 hours, and gambling Saturday 3 hours, I was the 3rd wheel. I felt like I was a tour guide for a double date or something. Dont get me wrong, we did have some fun, but it was a very awkward and uncomfortable situation, being the 3rd wheel like that. And they wanted to stay with the guys at their hotel on Sat. night.(they didnt because they didnt bring a change of clothes, which were at my house) I feel very much like I was used for a scapegoat for my one friend, who is married, just to be able to get out of town to see this guy. I did tell them I felt like a 3rd wheel on the first night, which didnt seem to matter too much because they insisted we hang out with the guys again the second night as well. Is it worth it even mentioning again or should I just leave it alone. I dont even think I want to invite them back again after this.

20090222170100AA9LMj9	Family & Relationships;Friends	Masturbation, watching your friends, normal or rude?	Well sometimes i think about doing "it" but mama says if i do i'll go to hell, so what do i do?      When me and my friends have play dates they all do it and i just sit in the corner watching, does that make me gay? mama says thats a sin too.      Sometimes they do it to each other, rubbing each other's "parts," and it makes me feel very odd and uncomfrotable in my corner seeing Jerrit, Jesse, and Brendan do these things. Should it be pleasant or something, this is very confusing.

20090222172637AAwoiBs	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my friend acting so strange around me?	I'm kinda worried about my friend. Lately he's been looking at me with this confused face, and randomly he'll change the subject to something dumb some guy did. He's also been really into his sports lately, and he's always been good, but he's never really been that into them. Plus, he's stopped talking to his girl-friends (as in friends that are girls) and when I ask him about his crush he just shrugs. Does it sound like something happened in his family, maybe his crush did something to him? I don't want to say anything wrong around him. Please help!
20090222173205AAb7U1f	Family & Relationships;Friends	Getting kinda annoyed...?	Ok, so I am in highschool, pretty dang young, and have a really low voice. Well, my classmates think it's great, but on Xbox Live, it's different. about 2 of every 5 parties I join one of my friend's friends gets on my back either making fun of me, calling me a liar, or accusing me of using a voice-changer, thus we either get into fights, or I get kicked out. I don't think this would be a problem if I literally didn't sound just like James Earl Jones. Please give me any advice, tips, or comments. Thank You. :)

I banned smoking in our house. Her friends all ganged up on me....and slagged me off to her....in my absence. She slept on the edge of the bed for 2 years....and there was no physical contact , love , hugs or kisses. Then she told me I was impotent. I thought I must be , cos she did not turn me on. I was going to seek Sexual Therapy....but got Free Therapy,(a touch of my hand...by somebody that did want me...did fancy me.....my Impotence disappeared ). I followed it up...to make sure it was for real. It was. Another lady came along that really did fancy me...and again no problem.She became obsessed...and set out to wreck our marriage and then the friendship that me and my wife...had kept hold of.       I still love my wife....I want her back. We have an Adult disabled daughter....who is suffering as a result of me not being at home to help. My wife is suffering....and I can't bear to see that.       Other people interfered with our relationship....her friends , neighbours , and family.       I want to launch a campaign to get her back....I still Love her....I always have....I always will. I want her back.      What's the best way , to do the best campaign....to get her back.?      I dont want to fail. I might never get another chance !      If enough people join the campaign....I think she may be swayed. I've told her a thousand times I love her and miss her....but I think she's afraid of what other people would say....of what other people would think !      Maybe if I get a few people joining my campaign...it might persuade her !      I feel lost without her. I need your help ....to get her back.I dont know what else to do xx
20090222174112AAcd4We	Family & Relationships;Friends	Best friend troubles help!?	well i have a best friend and i've practicly pushed ALL my friends away and made her like my one best friend, but things have been all weird between us and it seems like she loves her boyfriend more than her own best friend, and like she doesnt care about me anymore.

What do i do?   i cant tell her any of this,cause we'll fight.      and im trying to get her attention so bad that i've started to cut   just to see if she cares.   she does, but it seems like not that much.   please help me.   i dont wanna lose my best friend.

20090222183707AAepWCO	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do about my stuck up friend?	She always brings me down whenever she comes over, it never fails. When I got my first job, I told her and she said "I can't believe you got a job before me!" I asked her if she thought I was some kind of slacker or something, and she said no. But she does things like this all the time. She always looks at me like im stupid and i dont know what im talking about, and she acts like she is so much better than me.   I have a small house because I live on my own, and she came over yesterday and said "We moved and my bedroom is like, as big as your whole house!" And Im just like "Gee, thanks?" She lives with her parents, her boyfriend buys her everything, and she is spoiled. I love her to death, I've known her for 10 years, but she used to not to do this. Im not the type of person to start crap with people, but this **** is pissing me off.     What can I do to tell her to quit bringing me down, and have faith in me? I have to work for the things I get, my parents aren't here to help me. She doesn't understand I don't get everything handed to me on a silver platter like she does.       I usually wouldn't put up with this if it was from someone else, but me and her have had great times, and i know this is not who she is. She used to treat me like a human being, and didn't care whether or not I had the expensive things she had. But now its like she is disgusted with the way I live or something. i want to punch her sometimes, but I always keep my mouth shut because I know I could kick her *** in 2 seconds. Not to be mean. But HELP! I need advice.
20090222222507AAenoCf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Girls only. If you found a guy and he was 3 inches tall, what would you do?	Would you have him paint your toes?   Would you step on him?   Kidnap him?   Would you enslave him?   Have him kiss your feet?   Have him rub your feet?   Sit on him?   Tattoo him and (where)?   Make him smell something bad?   Stuff him in your dirty sock?   Have him do Other stuff? (anything you can think of.) funny is good too.      But if you have a better answer then go for it. I'm writing a story and need some ideas and basic plots.   I am actually thinking of having 3 different girls come into the story at different time. One is a good friend, one really mean and cruel and one who falls in love with him.   Thanks for your help.
20090222194509AAhsZH9	Family & Relationships;Family	Why is all this happening to me ?	I am 14 year old girl and I am starting to wonder what I ever did to deserve the crapI'm going through right now.      My own house got sold under my family and now we have to move out in a few weeks or else the owner will literally kick us out. My older sister is sneaking out to see guys and is making me cover for her.I just found out last night that my mother has cancer. My uncle just attempted to commit suicide a few months ago. My brother is about to be deployed to Iraq in a few weeks and has completely turned his back on my family. And I really feel like I'm stuck in the middle of all this crap. It just keeps getting worse and worse.       Why is this happening to me ?? Does karma really exist?? Even if it does,I have never done anything bad in my life....Does this happen to people once in life??

20090222192513AAyh1mj	Family & Relationships;Family	Getting over death of a family member?	This sucks. My dad died last Saturday and I'm more upset now about it them I was in the beginning of the week. He was my best friend and I have no idea how on earth I will get over this. I'm in my 30's and my dad was 62 and since I live in a fairly small town with not much to do, we would hang out almost every night after work together.  Being by myself in my house just thinking about it is driving me crazy.      And now I have this half finished Camaro in my garage that me and my dad would work on together and i have to look at this car every time I go in the garage.  It's freaking depressing.  I can't eat, barely sleep and feel almost sick to my stomach in the mornings from this whole ordeal.  It seems like I'm getting more upset the more time passes, I though it would get easier.      I should be drinking beer with my dad right now watching NASCAR, but instead I'm on the damn internet.      Even my dog is depressed. One minute I'm fine and the next minute i'm find myself crying like a baby. For all you people that lost parents, I don't know how you do it, this officially sucks and i have never felt worse in my entire life.        I sure hope Time heals all wounds.
20090222205729AAbowuq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women who are saving for marriage are critical of men and want to use marriage to restraint the man?	I'm just asking a question here so don't get mad at me. I have personally known 4 women who are saving for marriage. All 4 of them have negative views of men. Here is a short list of stuff that they believe about men (they told me):   -all men want to do is get laid   -men try to take advantage of women all the time and that men just want them for their sexual organs   -STDs (I agree with them here)   -men are always on the prowl for their vadge      Here are some traits about them:   -they're religious   -3 of them seem closed minded, only 1 is seems open minded   -they tease alot   -3 of them are hot, 1 is hot but fat   -they think that all/most men see women as sex objects      So I'm asking you, does it seem that women who are saving for marriage seem to dislike men so they try to use marriage to control the man?

20090222220412AApU8ZF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help!! my boyfriend wont shower?	Seriously. He just showered today for the first time in a week. If i dont make him take a shower, he just wont. He is good looking- but when he doesnt shower he just looks like a dirty drug addict or something. He used to get mad but now I just get him in the shower really wuick- Ill say something like "Wow, you had a long day at work, let me start the shower and some food for you" He still gets an attitude even then.       When I tell him its gross he says "the people in France/Europe dont shower everyday" But even if he would just shower every other day, I'd be much happier.       He also doesnt brush his teeth more than once a day, and he never washes his face. (And he smokes, as do I- but I brush my teeth 5-6 ttimes a day)       What can I do to make him shower, I tried having sex with hinm right after he gets out of the shower- (like maybe he would take a hint) But it didnt work.       EW. Help?       (we live together, I cant dump him- nor do I want to, and I have gotten him in the shower by giving him rewards, but honestly IM SICK OF FEELING LIKE HIS MOM!!)

20090222215652AA5XY8L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She dumped me. 4 weeks and now she wants me back. Revenge?	I got dumped and my heart was torn. I tried calling her, talking to her and even begged her to come back. But no luck. She went so far as to ignore me and became very rude.       I suspect she was cheating as well. But she denied she was ever cheating. I tried everything to get her back but nothing worked. After a month of trying, she ignored me and never gave me the time and day to work things out. She was cold. I gave up.       4 weeks of complete silence has gone by after she dumped me.No text, phone calls or email. Now I get an email from her asking me to talk things over. Although I miss her, I will never forget how cruel she treated my within the month I was asking for her back. I developed a hatred towards her..Now I'm not sure what to do. Should I get even with her and treat her like sh it (revenge). I'm really tempted to. And if so how whats the best way to be really mean to her?? I'm wondering if she has now come to realize that she doesn't want to lose me but thats beside the point now.

20090222220431AAEh96j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who can give me an honest answer?	I cheated on my boyfriend.   I'm going to tell him, but I'm not sure how to go about the whole thing.      Me and my boyfriend have been going out for about 3 weeks. He lives 3 hours away. I'm 18, he's 20. We've been friends for a year and a half now.      The last time I saw him was on Valentines Day. and I saw him once before that and that was when we first started going out. I haven't been talking to him for about a week so I thought that we weren't going out anymore. He doesn't have much of a way to get a hold of me though. So I feel like I gave up on the relationship because I thought that he just didn't want to be with me anymore. But I didn't give him as much credit as he deserved. There wasn't much of a way for him to get a hold of me.   So I hung out with this guy that I never expected anything to happen with. We made out, and that's it.   I feel horrible. I hate the idea of cheating. But at the time I wasn't sure if I was going out with my boyfriend. It was impulsive and stupid.      I just need advice on how I should tell him that I cheated on him :[.

I am Christian and I was hoping to wait till marriage to have sex but i thouight i found the one at 17 and that i didnt need anyone but him in my life to be happy. BIG mistake. We have been together for 4 years and just recently broke up. He used me and abused me alot in every way becuase he knew I would forgive him and becuase I would always give him a chance to do better for himself because everyone makes mistakes and i really thought i loved him and i wanted to mary him and be happy like a family should be, yea family...I have 2 children with him and my tubes are tied now I am 21 years old and am scared to even try being with anyone else and he has made me feel like no one would want anythign to do with me and plus i have 2 kids so alot of guys dont want that baby drama right? Well the point is I gave up everythign and everyone for him and in the end weas left sompletely alone.

20090222205113AAdbpDP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i know if this girl i met likes me need help please (advice from a girl would be very helpful too)?	i met this girl online she is a freshman and im a junior we also go to the same school. when i first met her i wasnt interested in her at all but we started talking online more often and then i started to like her a little. she never said she liked me but she said that she thought i was cute. we decided to meet in person but it took a while because when i seen her i didnt say anything so things won't be awkward but then later on she told me when i see her to go up to her and we could talk. when i seen her again it seemed like she tried to avoid me because when she seen me she went another way. when i seen her again i went to her and tried talking to her but she was very shy and really didnt say much, when i asked her something she would just say yes or no, i didnt want her to feel weird so i just told her we could talk some other time. everytime she sees me she tries to avoid me but if i dont look in her direction she glances at me. she has me confused, i really like her but i dont know if she likes me or if its just that she is shy but i want to know why she seems to run from me...i dont want to freak her out so i just dont say anything when she does that because im also kinda shy but with her its a little different

20090222205129AAIlOqk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just some sexual advice needed.?	I have two dilemmas I need addressed here      My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a month, although we've been intimate a good four months before that. By the way, I'm 17 and she's 16, and we're both still in high school, just for clerification.       Heres my problem, whenever I'm pleasing her,whether it fingering, eating out etc. she won't let me keeping doing it until she has an orgasm. Granted, she's extremely sensitive, (just nudging her breast causes her to freak out) and she gets self conscience about her moaning a lot. Is there anything I can do to make her feel more comfortable?         Also, this same girl continually asks to have sex with me. I keep telling she isn't ready (she's a virgin), but she insists that she is. Please tell me I'm not crazy for not wanting to just stick it in there.
20090222205322AAo2AuN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you get pregnant from anal sex while on your period?	here recently me and my boyfriend tried unprotected anal sex for the first time (ps- neither of us have any std's). and we did that for a good thirty minutes i'd say just on and off. and it would keep slipping out so he'd have to stick it back in. well about ten minutes later i went into the bathroom to check and see if i was okay because it had been a little sore which i figured was normal. well when i checked it was kind of wet like he had cummed in me so i wiped it off as good as i could with some toilet paper. well when i came back and told him about it he was worried that some of it might have gotten down to my vagina some how. and i remind you that i was on my period. so do we have anything to really worry about? i know we probably should have considered it before we did it instead of worrying later. so please help me out in knowing if i have a big chance in being pregnant. and also i want to know if this would count as losing our virginity? thanks.

I have told him repeatedly it makes me feel as if Im his daughter and not his partner but he doesn't see anything wrong in calling me that.

20090222205659AAMPQ6g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over jealousy and insecurities?	I'm blessed with a good man and beautiful babies. When I look at my life, I should be happy and content. But in the matter of appearances, I have always struggled with insecurities. When I was young I was compared to my sisters as the "ugly one." Looking back, by the time I was in college I had become more attractive and received plenty attention, especially for my figure. I was even asked to model. Now after having three kids, I feel like I am that ugly, plain girl again. My Dh, the red blooded man that he is, can't conceal his attraction to celebrities and models. He says he loves me and thinks I'm still sexy, but he doesn't look at me the same way as he did before. His eyes linger on other gorgeous women. It makes me ridiculously insecure and jealous - to the point that I'll have to hold back tears when he comments on another woman's looks or even when he ogles (discreet as he tries to be), I'm losing the baby weight to make myself feel better, but how do I overcome these awful emotions? How do I boost my self-esteem, when I know it is a fact that I will never be as beautiful or glamorous as a swimsuit model? How do I make peace with my husband enjoying another lady's beauty without feeling threatened? Since the women he looks at are more beautiful then me - does that mean he is more attracted to them then he is to me? I fear that I am starting to strain our relationship with my issues.    Thank you for any honest advice!

20090222220324AAV3VAa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you over come guilt?	I recently allowed something to happen that I never thought I would allow to happen in a million years, even the seconds before it occurred.  I use to know who I was and use to have a firm stand on the topic of pre-martial sex.  In my opinion oral sex is included in that.  For the first time in my 23 years I allowed myself to make the biggest sin/mistake of my life.  I willing participated in receiving oral sex.  I know that some people will comment that my Christian God doesn't exist so I should just enjoy my newly discovered self, while others will condemn me to hell.  All I feel now is utter guilt and disdain for myself.  We have been dating for almost 2 years and finally the temptation had gotten to great.  He doesn't believe that premartial sex is bad but was respectful of my wishes and had asked me several times prior to doing it if I wanted him to continue.  My body screamed yes, while my mind whispered no...my body won.  How do I overcome this overwhelming sense of guilt.  How do I find myself and God again.  I won't do it again.  I think this was a live and learn situation, but I'm losing sleep over it now and I feel physically sick from worrying about it.  I guess this is my way to confess and hold myself accountable.  Thanks.

20090222223027AA87U0t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Straight guys: have you ever experimented with other men?	My boyfriend (age 24) told me that whenever he was 15, he let a guy go down on him. He brought it up like it wasn't really a big deal and was surprised whenever i got upset. He wouldn't tell me any details (like who started it and why it happened and all that) because he said he "forgot" and gets disgusted by it everytime he thinks about it. If he were gay he wouldn't have any reason to surpress his feelings (his parents are really liberal and not that religious). He is definitely physically attracted to me too... Only warning signs are that he likes Celine Dion and chick flicks and he has a girly laugh.      He has been so honest with me and I have every reason in the world to trust him. He told me that he is not attracted to men and he would never leave me for any woman, man, or transexual, animal, vegetable or any object under the sun.       Should I be worried? Is it normal for guys to do this

20090222223421AAtXR92	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Past affair, should I explain?	When I was a young woman, I had a brief affair with a coworker of mine. I was 23 and had been married to my husband for two years. the affair happened while he was stationed at a military base in Japan for around a year. I still and have always loved my husband dearly, however, I was young and the affair was nothing messy, more so a companionship for a lonely woman with her husband away temporarily. I am in my mid-fifties now, and I have never told my husband about this affair. We have had a wonderful relationship since then, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable keeping this from him. My question is, do you think I should tell him? or not? It would be nice to get off my chest, but i am unsure of how he would react. He isn't the prying type, and I wouldn't want him to question our relationship or my keeping of information from him.

The guy who i like ALOT moved to a different state a month ago.

I mentioned about this guy who likes me in an email that i sent him(we usually communicate through emails).....when i did receive his reply, he said NOTHING about the guy who likes me....like he spoke about everything else....the email was long...but didn't even mention his name or said anything about him.....what is this suppose to mean?....whats going on with him?      (oh and if you want to tell me that i should not try to work anything out online, please dont bother answering...he visits this state often so i can work this out if i want...)

The problem is, he is very bad about flirting with other women. He tends to zero in on one, and flirt with her on a weekly basis until she follows him around like a sick puppy dog. Then, he and I argue about it. He just won't stop flirting. He was born and grew up in Europe, but he's been in America for more than twenty years, and should (and does) know better. We aren't engaged... but I'm deeply in love with him. When we are alone he is extremely affectionate, but when he is on the job he behaves distantly, to maintain what he calls a division between his public and private life. What should I do? I'm thirty years old, and this is the first real time I have felt love. I just don't want to let go, but I am unsure about his committment. He is a very special person, and I really want to trust him, and I know that he has never cheated on me. But he hasn't proposed...

Of joys once known and pleasures proved,    Heart's memry's fixed, and is not moved.    Across the years, I see your face,    Your cheeks aglow, your lasting grace.    Tho sight and sound do soon depart,    Your light stays bright within my heart,    And when I cross the bar at last,    Within my soul and firmly fast    Will be your smile, your twinkling eyes,    A vision fixed, without demise.

Plus my friend Mamie tends to lie about things, and I was just curious to see if she is lying about him and her since he lives a while away and she says they see each constantly. Which is also weird, since she is only 15 and hes almost 18, and her parents are pretty strict. Anyway, how can I ask him if he is going out with her, or has a gf without sounding like I'm flirting or interested?

20090222230248AA2xa30	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married guys, do you act this way around attractive women?	My brother, a physical therapist, on occasion sees this cute girl (in he 20's) for pt that he sort of has a crush on (although he denies it). We work together, and I notice that he doesn't act quite himself and even takes to complimenting her a lot, and changes the way he speaks when he is around her. Basically for a 35 year old guy, he sounds like he just time traveled back to when we were in high school. He also found out that she works at this bar and wants to check it out cause it sounds like a cool place, although I think he wants to go for this girl. Do you think this crush is going to develop into something else, because I also suspect that this girl finds him a bit charming. Should I talk to him about it? He's married so I'm afraid he might do something stupid. What do you guys think?

I don't want to end the relationship even though it's hard to not be sad about the circumstances.       I was just wondering if there's anyone out there who'd been in my shoes and can give me some advice on how to cope. I'd really appreciate it.

20090222223906AApH9vY	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I make her hit me first?	I've done nothing to her and she hates me now. She spreads rumors, and no one likes her but they act like it. And i'm not gonna be fake anymore. I need to know, what can I do to make her so mad she hits me? I dont want to be the first one to hit, but I can't handle it anymore. Everyone has limits.         There's a good reason though, see we were best friends, and now she hates me and is all "Bestie-Bestie" with Bailey... the girl I hate. On purpose.      Thats not why I don't like her though. She talks about everyone behind their backs and acts like shes all that. And i'm not saying this to be mean, i'm being completely honest, shes really ugly and she's over-weight. (Again, just being honest.)      The thing is, she says smart remarks about me, she starts fights, shes manipulative, and I was in a bad car wreck and I get out of school a lot for tests (that suck) and she tells ppl i'm out shopping. And one of the tests I had my dad saw how bad it was and how painful it was to me and he told them to stop because he couldnt watch me anymore. And she said I was on a "Shopping-spree". ...I'm not stuck up, I (up till now) was always sooo nice but she is driving me crazy. Violence isnt the answer, but every once in awhile everyone has to be set in there place. She's one of those ppl who's never been hit and thinks shes invencable and I need to show her that isn't true.      PLZ help, and no "You shouldnt fight" comments. I don't want anything like that. Just give me good ideas?      BTW: She gets very defencive very quick, and whines and yells until she gets her way so when she fights she gets in your face and wants to act all bad. She has that type of personality if that helps?

Ok, heres the situation...I'm best friends with this guy who I also like and eventually we started getting closer and like everyone in school thought we were dating when we werent, but he ended up pulling back and basically just led me on. Obviously, I was devistated and ended up drinking because of it. I never drink and he noticed and so eventually I told him everything, including that I liked him and then I told him I needed space to get over him. So, then he wasn't giving me space, but I just ignored it, until Valentine's day when he and my other friend came over to work on a project. We ended up giving eachother massages (him and i) that were pretty sensual, which isn't unusual for us, but considering I liked him, I thought it was. We also ended up feeling each other up...like feeling....and now I don't know where I stand or what's going on...help! I have no idea what he's doing to me or what that meant!!!! What do I do??

However, tonight I just saw he has multiple Xs across his chest. like one big x from his pecs to his hips. Im not sure how I can respond to this.  I talked a little to him and he said he isn't suicidal and he doesn't want to injure himself permanently, but that he wants to feel a continues pain to be "distracted".       I'm try to spend as much time as I can with him basically saying yes to anything he wants. I talk to him and try to include him in everything.    (BTW I just saw the X's tonight) Before this he has always been depressed. So, what should i do? Continue try to be overly Friendly or tell authority what I've seen and lose his trust. As far as I can tell im his only friend that he feels open enought to talk with. If he losses that I think things could get really bad. Any suggestions PLEASE!!!!
20090222231224AAc9IkD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS: Would this be sexy or just plain weird?	Alright, so, I've very recently gotten back together with my high school sweetheart. We had dated for about three years when he moved away and we decided that a long distance relationship wouldn't work out. Well, long story short, he moved back a month ago and we've been dating (again) for about three weeks and things are running smoothly. His birthday is coming up real soon, and I kind of wanted to go all out since the last birthday of his we spent together was kinda crummy. I bought a *very* expensive lingerie set (for cheap - yay for after-Valentine's Day sales!) and am planning to take him out to his favorite restaurant for dinner. I was thinking about asking a friend to run by my place and run a hot bath, lighting a few candles, putting out a platter of strawberries or something down those lines just before we come back. Plus, his actual present is an Xbox game (though, it hardly counts since I play video games just as often as he does, lol).      The question is: Is that . . . too much? Is it weird that we've been apart for almost a year and a half and I'm kind of planning a more 'intimate' couple's birthday thing? When we broke up, it wasn't malicious and we we were still very friendly to one another. Anyway, thoughts?

He wants me to talk dirty but i dont know i cant do that, may be coz i dont feel like doing it right now, coz at present our relationship is too complicated.   Moreover, v plan to marry & v r really a perfect match.  I have found him to be genuinely nice & sensible & he is really my type. But the problem is he is very demanding in regard to talking shitty things, he wants me to masturbate orally, & believe me i find it very uncomfortable but otherwise hez a fantastic person, i become so rude many a times but he never ever insults me. The thing is that v both like each other a lot & sometimes even i feel like going on that way, like being flirty, but the problem is i dont know how a girl should behave in such case. Actually, the fact is i dont have much knowledge about girl masturbating with a guy orally, otherwise he thinks i'm shy & dont know anything & asks me to grow up, infact i feel sometimes that i'm an idiot. pls advice. & ya do recommend some likns from where i can increase my knowledge of masturbation.

20090222232028AAmEjOK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to deal with ex wives?	I need help on how to deal with an ex wife in the picture all the time. It's great that they get along good, but it worries me. Their kids have some problems and those two are pretty much together, he lied about a seminar in LA he had to fly to for his daughter, said it was through work and he went. Then i found out his exwife was there, then he swore up and down they didn't stay at the same hotel, then I found out that they did share a room cause they didn't have enough $ to spend cause he put her daughter in some expensive rehab. so thats why they shared a room. and then later on i found out myself they actually took an extra day cause his exwife said he works too hard and should take a break, so they stayed an extra in LA by the pool, hanging out, took her out for suppers after the seminar and lunch breaks. what should I think? he said he was too scared to tell me cause I don't handle things good so he lies. Of course I wouldn't handle him and his exwife with secrets like the LA trip. If they didn't have the $ to have separate rooms, why take another day? he pays for everything, the house she has, bills, child support, the divorce, why the hell didn't she have $ for her own room?! I just need help to deal or on what to do. They're both starting to piss me off. He thinks I'm a stupid, young, naive girl or something. I don't know what to think anymore. I need help on dealing with an ex wife always being there and for our future. He doesn't understand how hard it is for me, and gets mad and expects me to be ok with it whenever she's around. We've been together for a year, so I'm still not quite use to her. Threatened too cause apparently she likes to show off her thong, has fake boobs and likes to not cover up properly. I never met her before, thats what he told me about her. I understand about them having kids and need to be contacting and stuff, seems like its going too far. This is starting to become a nightmare. Please, any advice would help. Thanks.
20090222232233AA1feV0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my girlfriend telling me the truth behind this breakup?	Me and this girl became friends a little over a year ago. We became friends through my girlfriend at the time, but after things didn't work out, all three of us kind of went our separate ways. After the summer, and new school year, me and this girl started talking again. But, as the school year progressed, I began to have feelings for this girl again. So, coming to January, after really liking this girl for all of December and determined to tell her how I feel. I told her, but at the time, she told me really liked me too, but at the time couldn't do anything because she was being asked out by another guy. Well, after two weeks went by, we still talked, the last week of January, she told me how she felt (she liked me a lot) and it was the best conversation Ive ever had with her. So, I asked her out that Tuesday, and we started going out. Everything was going great! We talked, txted, had a great first kiss, etc etc. But, after a while, I noticed she changed, and it was the only second week of our relationship. Not talking to me as much, and I could feel something between us. Well, this wensday, me and her had a chat and she told me how she was too busy to be in relationship and she felt bad dragging me along. However, I was devastated by this and asked if we could still try and go out and I didn't mind with her being busy with school. Well, that following night, she im'd me and said that she couldn't be with me anymore for her being too busy! I dont believe her, and she still wants to be friends, she even txted me Saturday asking why I was mad, and why I was taking us breaking up to personally. Am I in the wrong for being upset over this? I really liked her so much, and I thought she liked me too. She maybe did, but can people just forget about relationships that easily? I really need help as to what I do, I want to get back with her some day and I don't believe her excuse of being too busy.

The girl is confused what went wrong and posts on a forum generally that she knew a man who did not love a gal and yet he joked abt having sex with her..even though he was engaged. immediately the guy buzzed this gal on the yahoo messenger that it is not right..he cared for her and thats why he moved away thinking it might create complications in the lady(friend's) life.       my question is : did this person love the girl he joked abt sex with or not.      i was/ am married. he had arranged marriage.      thank you.

I met this girl online and we have been talking and texting back and forth for little over a week now and we are planning on meeting for the first time this Friday. I want to make a good first impression because even though I haven't actually seen her face to face I feel that I still know her. I haven't made any solid plans for the night and would just like to get some advice on how to make the date a memorable one for both her and I. Would like to do something original... not the whole date and a movie because I feel everyone does that and I want it to be special. So any suggestions about what would be appropriate from what to wear, where to take her, would it be ok to get her a flower or a small gift. Also, she has a 6 month year old son, would getting something small for her son be a good idea?

20060709080218AALkvXD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women go about with a look of being unapprochable?	This is not about *in interactions with men*      I have found most girls to be extremely friendly and nice once in conversation, even though they looked extremely rude & unapproachable as they were going about.      What FASCINATES ME... is that i will see a girl (a friend, acquintance, lover, whatever), when she's in company with us (me, group of friends, whatever), be VERY sweet and nice and just simply an angel, just a pleasant person to be around, BUT, the moment they walk off somewhere, they IMMEDIATELLY... transfrom RIGHT in front of your eyes. They go from angel to devil-look like *that*... and their face transforms to mean, unapprochable as do their demeanors and bodylanguage.      Most women I asked however can't say why they do it. I've asked all of them, and they're ALL surprised at the question. They don't know they're doing it. It seems to be unconcious.      What i'm asking here is if any woman is actually *concious* of this behaviour and can explain it.

I was in a off/on relationship with my ex for 6  months...we've both agreed to be 'just friends'....but a part of me thinks the decision is a good thing, but yet I find myself constantly thinking about him, and find myself wishing we were together.

I don't know what I should do: Move on or find the old love we know is still there. If we should rekindle our romance, how do I begin that?

20070307074149AAx2lnS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys (girls can answer too) why did he do this?	At first me and my bf were good friends for about two years and then I shared my feelings for him and he then asked me out b/c he liked me too. So that was back on Dec. 13, and then on Jan. 16 (two days after my birthday!) he said it was too hard to continue our relationship (long distance) and he just wanted to be friends. So okay, I was hurt, but I got over it. But then on Feb. 7 he said he was wrong to break up w/ me and he said sorry and that he missed me and wanted to get back together, so we did.    But, the thing is, during that time he never stopped treating me like his girlfriend. He keep flirting w/ me. And that hurt really bad! I didn't say it, but I was like "either just treat me like a friend or leave me alone completely!" Why did he do that? He's the one who broke up with me and he's the one who said he just wanted to be good friends! Arrrgh! This is bugging me! Why did he hurt me like that?

20061125090725AAAihGs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why has he stopped pursuing me?	I met a guy 4 months ago in a club we're in.  He's single,34, broken up from an 8 yr relationship 2 yrs ago.  I'm 45, single but look mid 30s.  We hit it off straight away.  Anyhow, four weeks ago, he invited me for a coffee and we kissed passionately.  After that he called me and we met for a drink.  We had a great chat.  He shares a small apt. with his brother so couldn't invite me back so we did lots of lovely kissing in his car. When I like a guy I don′t want to move too quickly in case it ends in a 'hit and run'!  So when he asked me to go to a hotel I explained it was too soon, and he drove me home and said 'we'll be in contact by phone'.  He didn't call.  I left a msg on his machine four days later..he still didn't call.  I was broken. Then I ran into him two days after that at a club..wow I knew I really liked him.  We danced but he said nothing about not calling me and he left without saying bye.  I really like this guy.  What can I do? Help me pls!

20061201223526AANNUNq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need him right now. That's okay, right?	I don't want to sound clingy or needy, but don't we all have those times when we need some help every now and again? I'm having one of those times, and my mom is asleep, my best friend is in Europe and unreachable, and my other best friend (who used to take my calls at all hours) is now my boyfriend. He's in Boston on business, and when I called he was getting ready to go to sleep. I put up a mild protest, but I don't want to be a pain, so I said good night.       But i'm going through some serious personal stuff right now, and I need someone. It doesn't happen very often, but when it does, shouldn't I be able to turn to him? So what's the verdict? Should I be able to ask him to give me an hour or so of his time (no work this weekend, just plenty of down-time in a cushy hotel) or am I being too demanding?

He talked about the future, told me he loved me constantly, and called me all the time. Out of nowhere he started pulling away and the phone calls stopped. He told me that he has been too busy with work and cannot give me the time it require to have a relationship. He said he realized he is not ready and does not want to be under the control of someone. He said "I'm not saying this is the end but I cannot do this right now". He told me that there is no other girl and that is not the reason. What does this sound like? I have been crying every day and unable to function.

20070320024918AAtyGLb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My special someone luvs me bec im honest.He knows I hav Time deposit bank acct bt its not true.What shud i do?	I love my special someone so much and I would like to be his wife. I'm just afraid someday he will found out that I dont have my Time deposit bank account ever since. It will really show my dishonesty.  I know he will understand it but i cant tell him the truth just by now. I have my pride that I'm taking care of. He just taught I'm good in savings although I have savings but not as big as he think..and he likes me for that "save money for the future characteristic". I dont know where he got that idea that I have a Time Deposit bank account. But its my bad when he asked me do I really have that, and I said yes. Ever since, I didnt tell him any stories that is a lie, only that thing that he knew I have that Time Deposit acct. So, sometimes I think that I rather let go of him just for that pride.

Mi novio y yo nos conocemos desde hace 2 a?os de novios 7 meses el dice q se quiere casar y todo. El problema es que lo considero un tca?o miserable en potencia, yo tengo una vida comoda y no sacrificaria eso x nada, mi detalle de que el es taca?o pichirre miserable es que yo tuve un problema y queria algo de dinero para una cosa de mi departamento y se insinue sutilmente el solo respondia que si queria algo se lo dijera como que esperaba que le suplique por, ahora luego me dice u sabes que mas de 80 no puedo darte, porque el supuestamente guarda para casarse, yo la verdad ni le creo porque no les parece que primero debe tener la novia segura, aparte de eso un dia mi abuelo le hizo unos favores y solo dijo gracias, no me parecio ya que si alguien hace algo deberia minimo invitarlo a cenar. Otro detalle el solo compra algo para mi por fehas jamas sale de eso y me sorprende. La verdad es que esoy decepcionada pero lo quiero pero al mismo tiempo puedo odiarlo.

20061222095131AAHUW2a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help me understand this why would she cry. Is there still hope if i just give space?	After 2 mounths of going back and forth w my ex we keep on talking to each other. I still love her. She says she doent want to think about us like that anymore and try and work things out. Last night i called her and i we kept talking till i sliped i was planig on proposing to her in june she was shocked. The whole thing ended up with both of us crying. Why would she cry she is the one that dumped me and i am the one pursuing this. All i want from her to think about all of this. I am stuck now cause why would she cry.       The relationship lasted 4 yrs and we both always talked about kids and marrige. The break up came from no where only that she felt no romantic connection. I always gave her my life i gave up parts of my life to be with her. I always told her how i felt and now this. Niether of us can stop calling one another. my only question is why would she cry over, if this is what she wants?

20061113085428AASHXXd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do Women make plans for the future?	Honestly, Chicks think too far ahead.  I met this girl and layed her, after that, she got it in her head that I was emotionally interested in her.  She found out about a trip I was gonna take to Paris and offered company if I needed it.  Yeah right, and ruin my chances of picking up Chicks, I say Broads need to think about the present and maybe the next day, don't jump too ahead or you'll get hurt.  I told her to never call me again unless it was for a booty call.

(new, big, gorgeous house) great personality, and we have so much fun when we are together. But since we have been sexually active, it seems as if he is addicted to me. But he refuses to help me out any way financially.. like he lives about an hour away..he begs me to come every nite.. but never offers to help with gas money.. he never has taken me out to dinner.. tho he has cooked for me.. and he always has a bottle of my favorite wine waiting for me when i get there.. so really my question is, does he really like me.. or is this attraction soley based on sex?

20070316195210AA1hUiK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	Ok so there is a guy I like but the only thing I can go on is this.He will ocasionaly look at me sometimes stare at me(im just wondering if is because he is wondering why in the world is she looking at me,or is creeped out or what) ask me for a piece of paper even if someone else has given him one and say i might need another one,we are always polite to each other but never really talk, for one im shy.he is a jock the nicest one i have ever seen he has dated some hot girls before im just kinda normal looking but not real hot and im a cheerleader but not the kind most people think of im a nice one. so sometimes it seems like it is so obvious that he likes me but other times it dosent any advice?
20070320151722AADUi0U	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do?	B4 i start, pls dont judge me. I just want advice. Ive been working for an employment agency for 3 months now. They've placed me with a really great company and told me that after my 3 months were up, the company can hire me permanently. I have to tell you that my bosses (at the company im working for) are somewhat cool. The male boss is really cool and has been pushing to get me hired permanently. But his boss is a female and she likes to point out my bad qualities and broadcasts my mistakes. Well the rep from the agency just called me to tell me that my contract is being extended for another month and 1/2 and then after that time, the company may decide to hire me on. They are also restricting my responsibilities. Mind you, any mistakes ive made haven t been major ones, and ive noticed that when others in the office make mistakes, its overlooked and not talked about. (fair? not really but oh well) Now heres my dilemma, I like the job, and my coworkers, but is this treatment right?
20060831085501AAOymtj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any great ideas?	Ok, I met this girl in my auts "lesbian" wedding few weeks ago. She was the maid of honor and the "host", so we got totally drunk and were last at the party with the married two. Somehow I ended at her place. Clock was something like 6 am. After that we had a  little foreplay that lasted for 12 hours. No "sex", no rubbers:(   But the time we spend together was fantastic... She had multiple orgasms, witch is always nice to see:) And do;)   But anyway, eventually I had to leave because of work next day. We split both unhappy. I had her number and called her. (really silent call) We went to a date, drank few siders and talked. Nothing big. After that every call has become more silent and awkward. And the reason for that is me. Stupid me called her really drunk few times. Next time I had to ask what I had said to her, 'cos I couldn't remember, only bits here and there. I really made a fool of myself in her eyes. Now I'm gonna call her again within 2 hours. Any ideas?

20070411221846AAfiiVH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I HAVE to know!?	Someone asked a question similar to this earlier, and I am curious as to what the results are. I may post this again in the future.      Based on these interests, hobbies, and age... what do you imagine I look like.      I have a fair amount of friends from several differnt groups. I am a game programmer with an interest in graphic design. I plan to minor in psycology in colledge. I have made ok grades through my life, but mostly on the upside. I do not do drugs and don't do too many reckless things, but I do share somewhat of an interest in organized crime. Most of my friends are nerds and techies.      Check back for what I ACTUALLY look like in 10 minutes. I'll be interested to see how this turns out.

20070316120831AAQaEm7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give things another shot?	Last semester, I hooked up with a friend... after the fact, we talked about dating but never really decided.  That ended right before break with me finding out that he was interested in someone else, overreacting, and him telling me that while I was a good friend, things that happened probably shouldn't have (even though he was attracted, too) and that he just didn't feel that way about me.      Lately, he's started flirting hardcore with me again.  He teases me all the time, he's complimented me, he brings up inside jokes and memories from last semester when we used to hang out, and we've hung out a few times this past week.  We see each other nearly daily, he calls and messages me, he's not afraid of flirtatious contact.        It seems possible that he's interested.  Is it worth the risk that, if we try this again, he might realize (again) that he's not interested in "that way" again? Is it possible that he changed his mind and it could work, or am going to get hurt by being naive?

He took me out to dinner and I had a little thing for him but I had a boyfriend at the time.... then that boyfriend was over and done with and me and this boy decided to get together.

But literally out of nowhere the other day, he just broke up with me and told me he wanted to be friends.   What is going on?   Whats wrong with me?
20070423104842AAwd0Ro	Family & Relationships;Friends	I had a disagreement with a friend / co-worker and now she's giving me the cold shoulder....?	She and I don't necessarily see eye to eye on things sometimes, but the other day she said something that hurt my feelings and I blatantly stopped and told her it did.       Later I embarassed her b/c I walked in on her talking about me behind my back so she tried to turn the situation around on me giving me a tongue lasking in front of other co-workers.       I wrote her a quick email and apologized for whatever offense I implied, tried to say hello in the hallway and she totally snubbed me. Furthermore, I found out she ran her mouth some more about me over the weekend and is trying to bring a mutual friend of ours into it and buddying up.       She obviously needs to agree to disagree but I can't believe the childish nature she's handling this.      Should I just move away from this relationship? It sucks that we work together.

20061229075549AAhqsqD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I have a chat with the person who answered me in the fourth place?	I was telling about my meeting a boy on the web, me being in France.Some were shocked by the fact that I am married.Things are a bit more complex.My husband is older than I am and is a bit confused mentally at times.My sole daughter ha sleft home by now and going on the web helped me overcome hours of solitude.   The boy I talked about is much younger and answered me on his mike as working.   We had a kind of telepathic relationship. When I was back in France last May, I wanted to take a picture of him as he appeared on the screen. It was not easy and I dropped the subject. Something told me to go into my in-box and I found out he had mailed me his own picture at the same time.   We watched the football matches as if we were together in the same room, exchanging comments. I had reported him on the tennis matches of the French Open as they were not broadcasted  in his town. Afterwards it was the Tour de France.   We had conversations on religion and music.   But he changed two months ago .

It went ok, we went out for a drink un some food. We talked and were holding hands across the table.

20070224112225AARgjaG	Family & Relationships;Friends	One of my mant best friends is mad at me, what do i do?	She told me about a concert she was going to last night and wanted me to go. i told her i would go if she asked out a guy i like to go.If not he could always be draged in by his sister. Turns out he had a girlfriend, andi didnt want to go anyway. Mosh pits arent my cup of tea. I thought that being a prep at a rock concert would be bad for me.       So explained to her i wasnt going and she said if i didnt go then she wouldnt talk to me.She tried explaining that it was at a church on a certain road but there is 2 and i had no idea which one it was anyway! She said she wanted me to go because she doesnt like going alone and me being one of her best friends she told me i HAD to go. She said she normally loses the person in the crowd and finds someone else to talk to! I tried saying sry but she's still mad. What am i suppose to do?

20060807083645AASa9bM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I love him....but is it better to start letting go?	dated Brian Jan/Feb of this year. I felt like he had saved me (was in a verbally abusive relationship on/off for 2 years) and he was the first guy that had ever treated me like I was more than just another girl. He left to Georgia and I was heart broken. I knew it would take me some time to completely get over him. A few months after he left his old roommate asked me out. I told Paul that I wasn't looking for a serious relationship but I'd still like to hang out and spend time with him. I didn't know where Brian's feelings began and Paul's feelings ended for me. I was confused. Paul agreed that he hadn't wanted a serious relationship in the begiinning as well. Brian everntually came back for a week and a grp of us went out. I got wasted and let Brian spend the night with me. I woke up the next morning devasted because I realized Paul was the one i was supposed to be with and I loved him. We are still talking but things are broken. What can i do to prove to him that I truly love him?

20060816080336AAZQNPw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know if someone may be a rape victim?	I know this question is pretty awkward, but I'm in an awkward situation.  Basically, I met a girl in another country, in Central America, and I went down there to spend a couple months with her and her family.  So after a couple weeks there we spoke about having a relationship, she agreed.  Everything is great for one week, then she changes - says she doesn't have romantic feelings for me any more, yet doesn't want to break up because she knows (in her words) that I'm a great person for her.  She's had this problem with other boyfriends in the past as well.  So I was thinking it was a maturity issue - the classic women never know what they want - although she is 26 years old.  But then I'm talking to someone I know who was a rape victim, and she's telling me that she used to do the same thing as this girl, and that she thinks there's a good chance my girlfriend is a victim of rape.  So I'm wondering if there's any characteristics common to most rape victims that might be an indicator?

My ex and I parted ways a year or so ago because she needed to work on some financial obligations and become more independent.  She has always said that i'm the one for her and that she will always love me.  We both dated other people during our seperation and were completely honest about it.  But we never meet anyone that we wanted to settle down with.  Since reuniting we talk all the time, she has gotten her situation straighten out and we are preety much back to where we left off.  It feels right and we are talking and taking things slow.  Do you think its possible to start a relationship off from where you left off.  We were pretty happy except for the one thing she needed to clear up.  She is a very thoughtful and considerate person who always puts my needs first.  I'm feling the relationship. What do you think?

20061005090454AAcGcaN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My love life has been sabatoged by brainwashing. >_<?	Hello,   Rediculous, but 100% true. Since I was born my parents have taken me to this one particular church. Finally when I was 16 (I am now 18) they relized it was completely a cult and it was teaching a bunch of bull****. It was too late, the harm had been done. Since the day I was born until the day I left those fu**ers drilled it into my head that girls cannot be friends with boys, you can't date until after highschool, no dating is allowed period, you have to court and get permission from the pastors. That being said, since I was a child I was taught (from the church) that dating was "evil". My parents never reinforced that, but I was too afraid to ask them about it. Now, I am 18 years old have never been on a date have never been fu**ing kissed have never had a boyfriend. This saturday I am going on a casual date with an old friend. I'm afraid that he will ask me out and I am feeling guilty. Why am I paranoid over having a boyfriend? How can I get rid of this guilt feeling?!

Real good advice needed from the Dating Gurus!!?   Ive been dating this girl for a little while now, weve been out four times already. Since date one, shes been trying to seduce me. I on the other hand, just want to take things slow and get to know her. I dont see her a "gf" material for now. Im not that type that just can sleep around with anyone. The furthest ive gone with her is Third base, and thats it for me at this point. Last weekend was a different story, after clubbing I invited her over to my place to get something to eat. I made it perfectly clear that is all my intention, she said ok. At my place she begins to seduce me, and i ended up in bed with her. We were going through the ropes of making love, I decided it was too fast, and I stopped and told her that I should take her home. Do you think i pissed her off? what should I do now? she has called me, to ask "how I was doing", through my voicemail? I didnt return her call. So its been 4 days since I last talked to her. Is it going to be weird from now on?

20061104165613AAcKP8x	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A question about guys- Advice needed sooner rather than later?	There is a guy at my play practice who is really nice and cute. He's one of the leads, and I'm in the chorus. We are in a lot of scenes together. I've known him for a few years now from previous plays, but it's been a really long time since I've seen him last. He's a year older than me- I'm fifteen, he's sixteen. We go to different schools. I really wanna be closer to him, but he has so many people around him all the time and I am kind of reserved (always with my two friends there). Any ideas? We all already have each other email's and numbers, so I can't ask him for either. Any advice or suggestions are loved. I don't know if I should just hang back and let him come to me, but do you think he ever will? Sometimes we catch each other's eye and then we both look away.

20061107093042AAWq3qf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm in love.....he's my boss?	I am over the moon in love with my boss. I think about him 24/7. I used to hate my job but now I look forward to every morning when I get to see him. He's available and acts intrested but plays me off with jokes, I'll say I couls take u home right now and hes says"you can't handle me" and walks away. He's 15 yrs older than me and I am afraid to make a move. I'm not worried about the job I'm leaving soon anyway. I just don't want to fear rejection negativily or even worse scare him? What should I do?
20061112085454AAW0mIU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys...In a relationship..What would you do? And why do you do it?	Okay.. So i was in a very very long relationship. We just broke up for family reasons (Our relationship was fine. We both still love eachother. He says he loves me and misses me) So I tried for a long time to resolve the issue and work through it.  He says he is confused and doesnt know the right thing to do (stay with me or make his family happy)... So now it has been so long we just basically argue because we do not see on common ground. I know the best thing to do is give him time and space and he will most likely come around.  But he is a very strong willed person (in previous small break ups he has admitted to not calling even when he absolutely wanted to and missed very bad) So I am afraid to totally not call him because he will never call... The question is... How long until he calls?  Can the relationship be fixed? (like is it possible for him to figure his stuff out before its too late and want me back) and what can a girl do to make him realize?

20061202075601AAZUnJY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What in the hell is GOING ON WITH MY Husband?????????????	This is insane! We have been married for two years. Recently... over the last two months our sex life is cutt down to once a month now... if I am lucky. I have confronted him with this and he is stating that he doesnt have a sex drive. He even got mad at me and said, " Is all you care about is sex?" As a woman... that makes me feel so damn low. He says that I dont make him feel like a man. I am 9 mos pregnant and he is out of work... and yeah stress may play a part of this... but he isnt so stressed that he doesnt enjoy all the activities that he used to.  What happened is that I told him I was tired of doing all the work in bed. I told him that I was tired of giving the oral sex, and being the one on top, and having to get myself off. I have never had oral sex from this man... and NO ... I am not unclean or unshaven. When we do have sex... he can hardly hold back. So what in the hell is wrong? He swears to God he isnt masterbating... and I know he isnt cheating and no PORN! WTF?

I've been through this conversation many times in my head, and I don't know what to do. I know what i fell for him is not lust, because my first interest was not for physical reasons. He goes to my church, and is one of my very best friends. We are in Bible quizzing together, and we like a lot of the same things. I have come to love him very much. At first, I thought it was just a stupid crush because I had no legitimate reason for "loving" him.However, I'm certain now that I do love him, but in a wholesome way (I am not obsessed with his body. However, I don't know if feels this way too. The problem is, neither of us can date until we are 16. I'm 14, and he's 15. So he only has 1 year to wait while I have two. Which means that even if he askes me out, next year, i won't be able to say yes. Of course, the thought has also crossed my mind that if i really think I could spend the rest of my life with him, two years is......

There's this guy I've been head over heels for but not only are we just friends, he's got someone else. I'm a pretty jealous person and it killed me that he put her over me even when Ive known him since forever.  But now after two months he's come to me with news that he'll die in eight months from what the doctors said. Should I tell him how i've felt about him and about the envy I felt for his girlfriend before its too late?

20070305224430AA9odaF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Keep him or throw him out ? He likes me now that Im Thin ?	Ive got a complicated problem.   I met a guy thru an online dating service a couple of months ago.   We had chatted online 2 months before ever meeting in person.   He lived far away so we didnt meet right away.   He only saw headshots of me and thought I was thinner than size 10-12. Also I cut my hair before we met when he said he liked long hair on women.   In person I could tell he was disappointed. He had told me he is a guy who likes skinny girls.   Now fast forward and he and I still chat online but of course he didnt ask me out again.   But I am now in great thin shape (size 2-4 ish)   And had new photos taken for my website.   He is an online friend and saw them. Now all of sudden that Im thin with longer hair he is acting interested in me again.   Should I give him a break because he thought I was thinner before he met me in person the first time ?   Confused. He is 32 and I am 30 btw.    And also I like being this weight, feel sexier, more outgoing and will maintain it for me.

20070309095548AAAxnC0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why hide stuff I didn't ask him to get rid of?	My question is this: I live with my boyfriend of two years and recently purchased  a computer for us...he initially loaded vast quantities of porn onto it as well as photos of old girlfriends/female friends/etc...i never told him he couldn't have them there to or to take them off ,but he made a big show of how he was going to get rid of them,like he didn't want or need them anymore. i put in a search the other day for some photos of my daughter i couldn't find and thru that found out that he had not only just hidden the pics deeper in the computer, but he has added to them and even broadened his collection of photos of girls we know(they are not porn like in nature).i am confused twice: why would he tell me he's going to rid them when he isn't and hide them?(it's technically my computer) and was i stupid for even allowing him to put them there in the first place as now they will be there forever even if we are not together someday..any ideas?

20070423074226AA204Xb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend Troubles...?	My bf and I have been together for 4 months and I care about him very much and I know that he cares about me. Lately he has been out of town a lot because of his job and the stress is really starting to get to him. For the last week or so we haven't really talked much...and when we were together this weekend things seemed to be a little off between us. We were together friday night and things seemed okay, but saturday he went home early because he said he was tired...but his mood just didn't seem right.      Usually he is more excited to see me and is more adament about spending time with me...but not this weekend. I don't think it is "us" but I am not certain. And I know that he isn't cheating on me...nothing like that.      Should I be worried...do you think it is the stress from his work...could it be something between us he is not telling me...should I talk to him about it now or give him some time for things to calm down at work?

20070430173241AAlcWZI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell when a guy is no longer interested when he sends misleading signals?	I met this guy at a party when he just grabbed me to dance with him. We were dancing pretty close and he wanted to give me his number. He was a little tipsy and was kissing my shoulder then he asked me if he could kiss me to see if what kind of chemistry we had and I would know about that because I am a psychology major. I did  not know what to say. I am a little shy when I first meet a guy. I gave him a hug and he kissed me on the cheek as I pulled away. I called him later the next day and he did not pick up and I left my number. A week later I talked to him online and he tellls me to call him anytime. I first conversation I did not say a whole lot cause I wanted to listen to what he had to say. He kept asking me what I was going to do this summer because we both go to college in the same city but are from different cities. He then tells me we should get together the following Friday. I talk to him Friday then he is like he is sick and is not going to work. Thanks for the feedback.

There is this boy. I started to become interested in him around Christmas. He went out with my best friend in the whole wide world for two years. I sat down and talked to her and she told me that it would not bother her in any way what so ever if i were to go out with him and she gave me her blessing. We were on terms at "Hey." for a while, but we started talking and we have become ok friends. We chat on myspace and at church a little bit. He lives in the neighboring town.

I am sixteen and I have never so much as held a boys hand. Since I am new at this I have no idea what to do! And I don't want to embarrass myself. Can someone please help me out here?!

However, she is a major drama queen and extremely talkative and confident.       I come to my grandmother in-law's house everyday for 3 hours afterschool and my step-cousin is there.

From when I'm doing my homework, playing basketball, playing the piano, swimming, using the computer, and even using the restroom, she will follow me or annoy me. I'm 17 myself (male), and I am tolerant of her. But she does annoy me. How do I get her to stop following me and why is she doing this? I've told her to stop but she says her sole purpose is to annoy me. I have a feeling she has a crush on me because a while back she said she liked me... Anyway, that's the story, I need help lol.

20090203131839AAbN0hd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Tips on dating someone going through a divorce?	I went through a divorce about 18 months ago.      I have just started getting involved with someone going through the a divorce as well.         While I absolutely think the world of her, I know where I was at that stage of my divorce (keep in mind, she did not initiate the divorce and I am in no way to blame) and am concerned that she is looking for a savior.      She gives no indication of this, insists that that is not where her head is at. However, I am concerned about proceeding forward in a healthy manner.      She and I had been very serious years ago and parted due to a tragic circumstance. As we've both put it, we never stopped loving each other.. it just ended.      20 years later we know have an opportunity to reunite and both of us feel it's worth the effort. There are families involved, the distance is over a couple states away, etc...      The most important thing for both of us is that this not be a rebound relationship.      Am looking for any and all advice.

20070917115606AAPYP7e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any advise for a young 20yo. male shy guy for getting dates?	A bit about me. I'm a nice guy at heart, 20 yo., college student but am kind of shy when it comes to talking with women with the intention of dating. Now I have a few friends that are girls (work and class) that I have no problem talking with, but when it comes to some random girl that I see that I would like to establish a sexual relationship with (meaning I want to be your boyfriend) I have a problem.      I've been able to pinpoint a few of my problems however. The key from what I've heard over and over again is confidence. I can see first hand (biased on an attempt I made the other day) that my confidence could use improvement on how I approach someone. Also biased on my personality and voice, I tend to sound lower then what I perceive. I never notice it but allot of people say they cant hear me and whenever I seem to make myself louder, it feels like I'm yelling.       The other thing is I don't know many conversation starters. Perhaps someone could enlighten me on a way to come up with->

20070730082213AAdsFuW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this sound like?	This weekend I was pulling in to a store and a car was coming in opposite of me and to the side.  I was thinking they might hit.  It turns out that it used to be someone I knew from college.  We were never really on speaking terms although she would make it  a point to talk to me.  There were even times when she would speak to me and ignore my ex-gf.  I always tried to be a little cold so as not to give her any hopes.  Anyway when she saw me she pulled over to speak and I guess catch up.  I barely recognized her and for her it seemed like we just spoke yesterday.        DRAGON 2008   "I BELIEVE IN U.S."

Do u think the the LOVE is still there between the 2 or they were using each other and the feelings aren't really there. If he is still with you and sleeping with the ex supposedly isn't he using them both. Do u think having sex with one of your Ex or the mother/father of your children old feelings will resurface...Men I hear u can have sex with random girls without being attached but do u think u will get attached to one of your ex girlfriends that u used to love if she allowed u to have sex with her again ?

We still relate perfectly and our families especially his kids are cool with it.  Thats just one of the benefits of them being a little older.  Recently we have both heard something interesting comment in reference to the age thing.  So my question is, is the age difference really that big of a deal?

20070626161628AAoPwFm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do now...?	I like this guy in my little circle of friends.  We don't really talk that much besides the times that our friends gather to do something.  I IMed him earlier asking a serious question about a project we're working on.  He was being really flirtatious, but I made sure to try and stay professional and I think I ended up being mean and I was mean to him once before a few years ago joking around out loud in front of everyone about how he acted stupid in front of mom.  Then today I told him how he's mean to me and doesn't talk to me etc. and he apologized and then told me he got embarrassed by what I said that one time about him and my mom.  Anyway, I flirted back... but I'm kinda scared to move on to him too quickly since him and his brothers are my best friend's best friends.  I talked allot but don't want to talk to him online.  So should I go ahead and tell him I like him or should I have my friend tell him? Or should I not tell him at all so that I don't ruin anything between us?

20070603110147AAo4f5S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Why can't i get a date? Everyone rejects me! Long and detailed?	To make a long story short, i'm a 24 year old male and i've never even been on a single date. I can't seem to get girls to like me in that way. The running joke in my family is that i'll never get married and my sister always jokes that i didn't "really" go to college since i had absolutely no social life during those years.      I suspected the reason for my misfortune was that I was ugly. I've had a few  male "friends" (i don't really like them) tell me that I look "scary" and that they'd be scared of me if we were not buddies. I'm definitely not fat, so it isn't that... I'm 6ft, ~180lbs and i have a fairly athletic build. I used to work out a lot and I played sports in highschool. So if it isn't my body, it must be my face, right? So i tried placing photos of myself on hotornot.com. I was surpsied that the ratings for my two photos were 8.7 and 9.2. The most frequent ratings in each score distribution was 7 and 8 respectively.

[like if he wanted a $4000 car, he would have to pay $2000 of it, my parents paid the other half] but the thing is.. my brothers were not* all that great [in school, at home, grades, etc]. brother#1 was a decent kid only because he hid things well and was sneaky, brother#2 was veryyy bad, brother#3 is pretty decent but not great. and as for me.. well lets just say that i am my parents last child and only girl, im in all honors classes, academic decathalon, student council, NHS, athletics and i am a good driver.    --------------------------------------...

20070624051534AAsJhVy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did this girl lay it on the plate for me to come and talk to her ?	well abt last yr i saw this girl and i began to really like her. i would stare at her alot and then after a while she began to stare at me alot as well. we used to stare at each other, but i was too shy to go and talk to her. Then she started wearing these really nice clothes to work instead of the uniform and she also wore these indian dresses, coz she is asian and she looked really pretty. She also dyed her hair and she looked so beautiful, but i still didn't talk to her. then  i went on holiday for 4 weeks and in that time i thought to myself that if i cant talk to her, then i should not stare at her and waste her time. so when i came back to work, i just did not look at her , but i found she was staring at me and wanted eye contact.    Anyway now i feel like talking to her coz i dont want to ignore her anymore, but the thing is she wont even look at me and i am now thinking maybe i have lost her. wat do u think i could do ?
20070518235014AA7ntdO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So, it turns out we'll only be friends?	A girl I liked posted a bulletin on myspace titled "strawberry" (see additional details, it will explain everything). I thought she had a boyfriend because a boy told me he's dating her, so I reposted it titled "lemon." She sent a message asking me why I titled it "lemon." I replied back that I'll tell her when I call her and she replied "call me now". I called and I started a conversation, and she asked me why I put "lemon" I told her she titled hers "strawberry" and what it meant, so she went back and decided to choose "cherry." She said she picked strawberry not paying attention, because she simply likes strawberries. I lied to her and told her I just picked lemon for no reason and she didn't pressure me to pick a fruit.      I think I kind of like her a little but I've only known her for a week and I want to get to know her more. She may not even be my type. I took her to my prom and we had fun that night, slow dancing really close and holding each other in all of our pictures. She had gotten dressed up so nicely for me I couldn't believe it. I put a picture of us together up on myspace and she downloaded it off of mine and put it on hers. I think I should just keep talking to her and continue to be friends.

20070729175021AAYOnKq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I love my job but since I had a seizure, a workmate is making things unpleasant for me. We used to be friends.	We share an office with the boss and it used to be great, but now he knicks jobs off me, doesn't give me important info on jobs backstabs me to the others (it got back to me) and even told me I was a burden on the office and "maybe I'm just not meant to be in this profession." I have depression already from having my hours cut back, and I dread going in to what used to be my dream job. What am I going to do?

20090203133426AAAtFiT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it a sign or is he just looking?	There's a boy that I like and I kind of, sort of feel like he's like me. But, I'm not quite sure. I mean when I'm walking in the hallways with my friend, I see him. So I look straight ahead and he's just there with his friends talking. And once I walk past them, they all stop talking and look at me. I've experienced this quite a few times. Is it a sign that he wants something? Or is he just looking. I'm so confused.          Then there is this one time when I was standing by my chair in class, he would stand by the door and I would stand behind people so I wouldn't see him. But every time, he would just look in my direction and I would try to avoid him. I can't seem too. I mean I really like him a lot but I don't know why he looks over at me. Am I just imagining it or is it just me, or him that is really looking at me?      Help, please!

If I don't know what to do I just won't say anything and I don't want to be insensitive, I just don't know what to say or do. Can anyone help me?

20090203131923AAWiAJG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Since the divorce, ive changed my views on women?	i was always the nice guy. i never really had much confidence. i was always nervous to talk to girls. and that was ok because i thought i met my one true love. turned out i was wrong. six months after we were married, she started having affairs, got pregnant by another guy, emotionally abused me, took my son from me for months on end, and that is just the beginning. at first i was devestated, lost, confused, empty. but little did i know this would just open a whole other side of me...      I have become an aggressor. im what you would label as a bad boy, or the jerk. i never thought i had it in me, and more importantly i never thought i would be so good at it. the worst part is i dont even have any remorse. i feel as if i was going through all i was and not a single person cared, so why will i care for anyone else. i use girls, and dont feel as if its my fault. its up to them to get a clue, or ill keep it up. all is fair in love and war right? im not saying i dont wanna settle down with a girl sometime, because i do, but right now i dont think i can. why has my past failure caused me to be like this

I am about to start my spring semester (first year) at college and I still have not made any friends.  I do not have a roommate and just haven't met anybody that I have clicked with.  I am not shy, but I am very introverted (there's a difference!)   I always sit in the dining hall alone.  I see other people sitting alone and have the urge to sit and talk with them, but I'm not sure how they will react.  And I don't know if it would be too weird to sit with a guy I find attractive.  I'm not gorgeous but I think I'm pretty enough.      So should I just go for it?  How would you react if you were sitting alone and a stranger came and sat with you?

20090203135254AA2YBdK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Am I hurt by this?	I have a friend who always invites me to places, but i can never go because she lives a distance away and I don't drive which makes it harder for me.. On new years, I invited her to my house for dinner and she said she'd let me know, but didn't.. I called her a month later and asked why she didn't call, she said she did, but i knew better.. anyway during the convo, she cut me off and said she'd call back but never did.. I then called her 2 days later and left a voice mail asking her what i had done to anger her? she nev er called back.. I have now erased her phone, so she;ll never have to worry about my calls.. also another friend didn't return my calls-we had gotten into an argument about her calling me fat and being so insensitive. she instead got more than i who she had insulted.. on top of that my bf has been acting weird accusing me of cheating despite the fact that i'm always indoors, he's out a lot and won't let me come with him etc.. I'm not compalining, but just upset at being lonely.. I spend my time writing songs and poetry to get me thru.. what would you do in my situation?
20090203133241AAh9p0g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i get in his car?	I met this guy a few weeks ago and he's pretty cool. He's a bit protective of me and he's so sweet, always holding my hand and carrying me around. I really like him, and he told me he likes me, but i have one problem which is the age difference. He's nineteen and i'm only thirteen... which makes me feel like such a baby. I'm surprised that he's okay with the six year gap, most nineteen year old guys wouldn't give me the time of day and i know you probably think he's a pervert and that he's using me, but he's really not that type of guy. He's never tried forcing me into anything, or anything like that. He's genuinely nice.   Anyway, he drives and he's offered to take me for a ride sometime, we don't even have to be alone. He's a really good driver, but he drives fast and dangerously on country roads at night. I'm up for it, sounds exciting and i'd probably be the first to make a move, incase you're thinking he wants to take advantage of me in his car or something. He's a good guy. I was just wondering if you have any advice or past experiences you'd wanna share with me before i make any wrong decicisions? Thanks in advance : )      x x x

What is wrong with me?
20090203135132AApkjpG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I hate my emotions sometimes... I just need to vent... (Edited and reposted)?	The first time I wrote this, I don't think anyone understood what I was trying to say, so I edited it and reposted...    I am going to try to make a long story as short as possible...    Before me and my boyfriend were together, we were 'talking'. Ya know... 'feeling' eachother out, testing our boundaries, seeing if we were compatible. During this time, we had agreed not to see anyone else, and we had also agreed never to lie to eachother. Even if we had just decided to be friends, we would never lie to eachother.    *Note: I was wary of him in the beginning because he had told me that in the past he had cheated on almost every girl he has ever been with. He said that he told me that because he wanted to be completely open and honest with me. I respected that... but at the same time... put my guard up.*    During this 'talking' time we had, there was a time where he was complaining to me about how his ex kept wanting to come over and sleep with him. I told him what to say to her, and he did, he copied and pasted the convo. A few hours later he said he was going over a friends and he would talk to me later. A couple of hours later he came home and told me it was boring so he left.    I left it at that.    Ok, fast forward 2 months...    We decided to be together. I moved in with him. I found something on his computer. This is how the whole thing went down:    Remember that convo he had with his ex? The one that wanted to come over and sleep with him?? Well... I found the convo...     This is how it really went down:    Initially, he sent me the convo between him and his ex. What I had found on his computer was the convo between the two of them. What he failed to mention, was what was said *after* he told her what I told him to tell her. He left out a huge part. The part where she said she was coming over and she was on her way. Later that night she had IMed him again saying "Wow, that was fun!! Don't you think?? When will we be able to do that again?? Don't worry, I didn't tell anyone what happened."    Hmmmmm.    I'm not stupid.    I confronted him about it and he admitted to me that he had, in fact, lied to me. That he did sleep with her that night.    I know what you are thinking, I have no right to be upset about it. We were only 'talking' when he slept with her,  but if he had told me this when it had happened, it would have turned out differently. Hearing this now, it upsets me. He lied to me. And hid it from me.    Ok so I eventually got over it. It still makes me cringe to think about it though. It happened right across from the bed that we sleep in. Gross. And now, there are problems with her family and his family. I won't get into that, but it makes it so that she has constant tabs, and contact with my boyfriends family.    I'm fine about the whole thing until I start thinking about it. *Duh*. I don't know why it bothers me so much. I wish it wouldn't. I feel my heart breaking every time I hear her name or think about the situation.    I know what i'm feeling shouldn't be happening, but I can't help it, and it's tearing me up.    I hope this made sense, I have a lot going through my head and there is a lot more to the story, but I didn't want this to drag on.    I had to vent. Thanks for listening.

20070803153225AAPYHlZ	Family & Relationships;Family	Black father's..I Love you?	My father and I talked today...we always have the best talks and he told me.."Lele, don't worry about your car note, I will pay it for you until you get back on your feet"  I looked at him with tears in my eyes and said Dad, how can you do that your not even working and he said I will do anything for you because you are my child".  I began to cry because you see, a few weeks ago I fell ill and now i have had to move back in with him and my mom to recover.  I have absorbed all my leave at work and what he did he has never done before.  He had a heart attack 3 years ago and has not really fully recovered and after I got sick he applied for a job knowing it may put his health at risk but he didn't care.  He told me that when it came to my brother and I he would do what he needed to do.  He loved us and that's all that mattered. To all my black fathers that truly make a family...(you know who you are) despite what people say stay strong because us black children need you....always!!!

So this kid I was dating for 4 months and LIVING with broke up with me about a month ago and ever since then it's been a hell ride...... he had slept with a girl in the VERY bed that had been mine, apologized a week later and said he felt bad and he wanted to be my friend, asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits, I said no, he promises that he'll always be there for me, claims we're destined to be together 4ever,........a few days later I hear he's hanging out with a chick 4 years younger then him who's homeless and living with him and his roommate NOW that she's homeless (he's 22).... he turns his back on me when I have a death in the family and my dad gets injured.....      NOW here's what he's doing..... he's claiming he "knows" of two things about me that he finds are "hoeish" and that he's lost all respect for me and that he NEVER trusted me. He won't TELL me what those things are, and that I should KNOW what they are and to just fess up..... I don't know WHAT the heck he

20070618131501AATzi7Q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need a guys point of view.....?	I have been friends with this guy for a little over 4 years now. We met when we were both about 18-19 and have dated on and off for the entire time. When we first met he was still a in his immature. "player" mode and skipped from girl to girl, but always ended up coming back to me (mostly since we were just friends for the duration of most of this)..... At the start of this year we got into a serious relationship and moved in together. It was really great in the beginning and all, everything seemed fine. But about three weeks ago things turned crappy, he seemed irritated at me all the time, constantly said he still cared but that maybe we shouldn't have moved in together.....      Then he broke up with me about a week after turning "cold " on me. I heard down the grapevine that he slept with this other skanky chick that I never liked but that he's messed around with before. I was completely devasted that someone who had seemed so devoted just a few weeks before that suddenly turned his
20070619131959AAw1xUM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If a guy.......?	that just recently broke up with me, who tells me he still cares about me and what not, tells me he's not trying to date anyone when I ask, yet is hanging out with one particular girl more often then usual..... is he lying? or is he just friends with her???         We hung out for the past week and a half non-stop, had deep conversations about our relationship (he even went so far as to tell me he thinks maybe we're destined for each other...) and just all in all were getting along great. But then sunday after I left his place I texted him later in the day saying that maybe we should take a lil break from hanging out so much cuz I don't wanna fall for him again..... now he's giving me the cold shoulder completely.       Do you think he's lying when I ask if he's trying to date that girl? And why would he be giving me the cold shoulder after we were getting along so great? Do you think I hurt his feelings by saying we shouldn't hang out so much????
20070623121634AARMhpJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need help getting over him......?	I've been on and off with this guy for 4 years. We've been friends that long also. This past week tho he turned his back on me and told me he never wanted to speak to me again. (there are reasons for him saying this.... ) He said this to me right while I'm going through a death in the family. I'm so completely devastated that he could walk out of my life in my time of need and I'm having such a hard time coping with the death AND with him deserting me.       Do you think this guy feels any remorse at ALL????       Please, I need really good suggestions on how to get over him because I can't stop thinking about him even though he was so cruel to me.       (ONE of the reasons he said told me to F off is cuz he's trying to get with a girl 4 years younger then him.... there are other more mundane reasons that he gave).....      I know this guy is scum for doing this and all, but it's the FACT that he did it that is making it so hard for me to shut him out and stop thinking about him... please help me
20070623130920AAOhKqI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it normal to constantly feel like you want to share your life with someone???	I get so depressed all the time cuz I always feel like I want someone around to share experiences with..... I always want to feel emotionally connected with someone and if I'm not I kind of feel lost.... before I ever got into any really serious relationships with guys I was a super independent person. I could get by day to day doing stuff by myself and be fine.      Now after I've gone through two really bad, emotionally abusive relationships and one good relationship I'm constantly feeling alone.       I just really want to have that independence back where I don't feel alone when I'm out doing things....       please give suggestions
20070623091830AA0BVOG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS! think back to your early 20s then answer this.....?	If you had a really great friendship with someone who was going through a death in the family.... and really needed you there, but they were really over emotional and snapped on you for no reason......       would you walk away and turn your back on them because a cute 18 year old girl walked into your life and you want to have sex with her?      My ex just did this to me..... we had a great friendship going on, but then I snapped when I heard he was hanging out with this SUPER young girl and he told me he doesn't ever want to talk to me again and that he's had enough of me. This is just DAYS after he said he's always be there for me no matter what. then after I snapped he told me he's "sorry, but I don't want to help you anymore, etc...." because this girl is in the picture.       Could you be this coldhearted???? Wouldn't you feel bad for doing that to someone you were close to, even if it meant you were going to get a laid? Once you got laid, would you try to apologize cuz you felt horrible?
20070705124007AARi7Kr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over someone you deeply cared about.......?	I want to get over my ex so badly.... I just want all the good memories to stop so I don't sit there and dwell on them. There were so many more BAD memories then there were good, and I just want to get OVER him so I can be happy again. How do married people do it when you get divorced?????       You have so many ties with each other....... I lived with this guy and we got serious, deeply serious....... he promised he'd always be there for me, then broke that promise....now I'm having such a hard time getting over him.......       He has another girl living with him that I'm pretty sure he's dating now, not sure,   but then he still texts me with "Why do I miss you so much" even though just the day before he was telling me he hated me........ why can't he just leave me alone???????
20070705140315AACNqjX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy say he hates you one day, then he misses you the next??????	My ex is mad at me for his reasons and I'm mad at him for mine, he tells me he hates me this past weekend..... that he just wants me to go away.......      but then when he gets all drunk the other night he was texting me with    "why do I miss you so much" And   "I hate you so much I wanna love you"      He now has a different girl living with him (she's YOUNG, she's 18, he's almost 23, I'm 24)..... I used to live with him..... I don't know if they're actually dating or what, but she's sleeping in the very spot that use to be mine.....      He told me he can't live with the person he dates, but I've heard rumors, and i'm not stupid.... I lived with him so I know how he is......  This girl is SO young and dumb, I don't even know what he sees in her AT all, cuz he always told me he liked my intelligence and insight.. she has none      BUT WHY would he tell me to go away one day, and then text that crap the next....... he's got a new girl, why won't he just leave me alone!?!?!?

But when we were about to get out of there, she was behind me and I looked back at her and she was eyeing me from toe to head and i swear I saw her lick her mouth in a sexual way. She thought I didn't see IT but I was so freaked out! I actually had to make an excuse to go home alone. What the hell is going on? What shall I do?

He treats me so nice. He took me out into his car etc, we always talked a lot. Although he take me as his gf he never pressured me for sex and our conversation are never about sex. I keep telling him that I don’t want a relationship with him. I just don't love him- and I feel so bad and sad because he is such a nice person. I made it very clear that I am not his gf- he sometimes even says he wants to marry me and that I will be he's wife and saying his mother is my mother or saying things such as he wants to talk to my father to explain about how serious I am to him. I keep telling him not to fall in love with me and he says he can’t help it. I don't wanna break his heart- he is so sweet but I know I will never feel that way about him. He keeps on asking why I don't want to be with him and there must be something wrong with him he says. But to be honest I am in love with someone else (though we are not gf and bf). how can I tell him that, I’m scared it will break his heart.

20070520144851AAnQe00	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl have a thing for me? she has a bf though?	Yes, she has a boyfriend of about 2 or so months yet she's paying a lot of attention to me. We were introduced through a friend and been really talking since the start of May.  Just recently it turned daily, mainly because of her.       But yeah, she texts me everyday with random little things...  from work, or when shes out, or late night when she gets home on a weekend. I'm thinking she must think of me a lot if shes always hitting me up. We also talk on the phone late night for a long time... this is all normal to me when I'm dating, but this girl has a boyfriend so I really don't know whats up. Yeah I'd like to make her mine, but not right now, shes taken. Is this girl showing me interest?       Also today, I'm heading out to dinner with cousins tonight but when i told her "Im going to dinner tonight" she really was quick to ask "with who????", i mean, if she didnt see me that way she probably wouldn't care who i went with right?  im prob thinking too much on this though....

I asked him if we would ever go out and he said he didnt want to be tied down with a girlfreind his senior year but soon to find out he was trying to get together with some freshmen girl. they dated for a couple months as well. so he broke my heart twice but i still want him what should i do?

20070524182853AAhQ7l3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is is possible? Advices please...?	Well the man of my life and I have been together, on and off, since October 2003. We have been through a few speed humps, here and there, but we have managed to keep it all together. Well, right now, we aren't together because he is not ready for a relationship again, since he is trying to get his life together (make his money and go to school - college). He told me he does not want me out of his life, whether or not we are together. He says that he wants to at least be cool and that he does not want to lose contact with me. Well, right now, I "may" be pregnant and with his child. He and I have always been strongly sexually-attracted to each other. What I mean by this is that if we are in the same room, we are bound to have sex lol. But right now, we want to be REAL friends first, and that means we cannot have sex, or at least try not to lol...any suggestions on avoiding this predicament? Will this even work, since we are so attracted to each other??   Thank you, in advance! :D

Cuando yo tenia 13 a?os (hace mas de 20) mi hermano mayor me empezo a ensenar revistas pornograficas, y me hacia que lo masturbara. Lo hacia siempre que no habia nadie en casa y me decia que era para "prepararme", para que yo supiera lo que un hombre queria de las mujeres, que no le dijera a nadie. No llego a tener sexo conmigo, pero siempre le he tenido una clase de rencor que no puedo olvidar. No se lo he dicho a nadie de mi familia  Pero ahora que el esta enfermo, mis otros hermanos me reclaman el que este tan alejada de el y que no le quiera llamar para ver como esta. Pero la verdad, no me nace, prefiero no hablar con el. Siempre lo he tenido al margen de mi familia (mis hijos y esposo). Creen que estoy bien. O debo de llamar para ver como esta.

I've never had a boyfriend or ever kissed a boy.  When guys hit on me I think they feel bad for me or are just being nice.  My family has always made remarks since I was young about me being worthless and my little sister, who has a revolving door for boys, is embarrassed of me.  She thinks since I don't have a boyfriend and that I'd rather enjoy solitude with a good read than going out to the club that I'm a real loser.  Her and the rest of my family makes fun of me and it hurts.  I've always wanted a boyfriend, just to have that experience, and to know what it feels like but I just feel like I'm too ugly and too fat and that nobody would ever want me.

20070613154938AA8opAp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Rejection?	we are in highschool. and I do still conflictingly like him, school is out    There was a boy, who I had known for a year, he bugged he alot last year, and we are put next to each other in class. We had another partner, but for some reason he never spoke to her at all, not even when he had to! So we became better friends. When I would ever go to do anything he would just stop and stare, not even making a move when I went to the bathroom (we did ALL our work together). When I went to the bathroom he would steal my stuff, and then I began to get this FEELING that the liked me. He would sort of hold my hand for a while, put his arm over mine, and look at me when talking to his friends, and his friends started to stare at me. Eventhough he did not really talk to girls he told me everything. ONE DAY IN A RANDOM CONVERSATION HE ASKED ME IF I LIKED HIM. And I did not answer him. We went on break and I wrote him a note saying that I did, and I noted it clearly.

20070619200835AAlttY1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A big flirt or does he really like me?	This guy in my senior class is always hugging on me  and sending me text messages. Everyone keeps on saying that he likes me and I like him 2. Today he rubbed my leg because I had hurt myself at gym and I forgot to mention that we talk on the phone every night for 2-3hrs. But anyway, today he was all up on my friend and rubbing her stomach just being nasty while I was sitting there. I will never but a guy between my friendship but what should I do ? She was enjoying getting rubbed and getting smacked on her a** and laughing in my face. My feelings for this guy is on thin ice and I don't know what to do. My mind is telling me to move on to the next guy but my heart is telling me that I should just keep on holding on.  Being that I'm a senior, should I just cut them both off and move on into college? She knew that we have feelings for one another and I tell her all my secrets and it seems like she stapped me in the back. He is going to call me soon, how should I take care of this

My mum and her husband were going out to drive to somewere else in the country. ( i live in england ). They had 1000 pounds in an envelope, and they took that with them. But they said   200 pounds went missing when they got to their destination. And they think my sister who is 19, stole the money, as she was the only person in the house. My mum and husband were in the house, but my mum was in the bathroom and her husband was loading up the car and they said that in that time my sister stole the money. They are very upset, so is my sister and so am i. But i know my sister didn`t take the money, and whatever i say they don`t believe me and they say they know its her. What can i do? I`m worried the family will be spilt up. Do you think me and my sister should go to the police and explain the situation?   Sorry for such a long question but please help me i`m stuck.

20070623114922AA1DWJP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell an older married male friend he is getting a little too close?	Hi I am 27 and single (never married).  I have a friend at church, he is about 35 years older than me.  We have become really good friends. But he is starting to scare me a little.  He calls me when he wife leaves the house or when he is at work.  The other day he called me and I didn't answer so he called me two more times.  When I finally called him back he asked me where I had been.  He sounded like my dad or boyfriend.  I am also really good friends with his wife.  They both emailed the day they left for a cruise.  He said he would miss me and wished I was going with them and signed it love you.  She said she would miss me and to behave while they were gone, and she signed the email Mama.  I would like to be able to help him understand that he is getting close to a line he shouldn't cross.  Their marriage is good and they have their share of problems but I think he is getting an idea that I'm not interested in entertaining.

I'm an asian guy and I'm absolutely crazy about latinas (its helps too that I live in San Diego which is like 1/3 latino here)      Whats the best way to win over a latina's heart? Besides the usual, you know like go up to a girl and talk to her/ make her laugh. I'm pretty sure they aren't like asian girls who spend most of their free time in the library or staying at home (no offense, but its soooo true lol).      For the most part, what do latina women like in a guy? Do they like adventurous guys, party guys, studious guys etc..?

20070815190559AAqGKl2	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Need help with reception lighting!!!?	I bought a string of white Christmas lights today. I was going to string them along the width of my reception hall. That way it will kind of look like stars when you look up. Well the Christmas lights are all wrong. There's too many of them and they are too close together. I've seen this type of lighting done in pictures but can't seem to find out what they used. My mom thought maybe they used net lights (like the ones that cover your bushes during Christmas). Well it would take 136 of those. Putting the price well over $600. My question: Does anyone know what type of lights are typically used along the ceilings in reception halls? Is it the net lights? Are there others I don't know about? Help!

I agreed and just left it at that.. since it is weeks away..      When we were sayin our goodbyes, I didn't remind him that I would be in town, but he asked me if I was still visiting and to give him a call to catch up, I said ok.      Now...how come he hasn't been in touch in the meantime??    I sent a short email, asking how he was, but he didn't reply..   I will still give him a call when I am in town, but don't know what to expect now..??      (I may be moving to the same state too, he is aware of this)

20080119135335AAOGh9z	Family & Relationships;Family	How do i convince my mom that i shouldn't be grounded?  That she should let me go out this weekend.?	I got grounded last weekend because i failed English.  I know your thinking how do you fail English?  Well let me explain.  After my English class I have to see the guy that I have liked for so long.  And we "talked" or "dated" for almost 5 months.  But then randomly he asked out another girl.  I still have very strong feelings for him.  So all I think about during English is what is going to happen when i see him.  So it's so hard to concentrate.  Actually I can't concentrate at all.  My parents know all of this but still decide to ground me because of my attitude and lying to them.  But I've already been in trouble for lying so they're just using that as an excuse.  My parents have stressed me out so much I've resorted to drinking, drugs, and cigarettes.  I am 14 years old.  I don't know what to do.  I've also though about running away.  Please help.

20090203132321AAmFhM3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My girlfriends sister wants to move in, but I don't want her to. What should I do?	My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over a year now, and have been renting a house together for about 4 months. She has a twin sister, and I have 2 little sisters who are also twins. Our familys have known each other for many years, so we are all pretty comfortable with each other.      When we first moved in, one of my sisters rented the 3rd room from us (the landlord is a family friend) for the first month, and then moved out.      Since my sister left, my gf's sister has been wanting to move in. It comes up once or twice a month. Money is very tight right now, so the extra cash would help. She can be a ton of fun to hang out with, and I like being around her as much as anyone most of the time.      The problem is that her sister is one of the most irresponsible, lazy, stubborn persons I have ever met. Her previous apt. was an epic disaster 24/7 since she almost never cleans (a problem they both share), she has an unemployed boyfriend with a 2-3 year old kid (I think he lives with his parents or something), her friends are extremely shady, and she gets MEAN when she doesn't get her way. Often berating my girlfriend to the point of tears if she wont do something like pick up a shift for her at work.      All of my senses tell me that we are just going to be taken advantage of. I feel like she will help out at first, but eventually stop cleaning, start getting loud at 3am on weekdays, and get angry if we ask her to do anything she doesn't want to do. My girlfriend got her a job only a few months ago, and she will show up constantly. Sometimes hours late even.      I feel guilty saying "no" to my girlfriend when it comes to her family. I also feel like maybe I am assuming too much about how her sister would act. My sister was not the perfect tenant, but she cleaned up after herself, held a stable job, and kept to herself for the most part. Her sister has never done that for anyone, why would she do it when she lives with us? Should I just flat out say it's not going to happen, so give it up? Should I ask for a deposit to have the extra security?      HELP!

O meu ponto de vista em rela??o as amizades aqui do Yahoo sempre foi de cumplicidade, respeito, solidariedade entre outras coisas.      Mais ando pensando em " Lista de amigos " sendo amigos virtualmente, Creio que a amizade se conquista por meio de rela??es de cara a cara e olho a olho.      Alguns avatares do Yahoo se referem a outros como amigos, mais será amigos de verdade mesmo ?

This is the body language he gives out to me:   *He stares at me in weights class and we make a lot of eye contact everytime i look at him he looks back at me.   * We make eye contact when he passes me in the hallway and he always stares in my direction at lunch.
