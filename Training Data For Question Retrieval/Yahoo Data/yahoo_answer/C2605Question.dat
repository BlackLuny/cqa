20090309184837AAqcGA5	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Custom Box for Alpine Type X 12" ~ I'm building one, got some questions ~?	Alright so i just bought a brand new Alpine Type X 12" sub and i have the manual it comes with with all the correct info on it -   It states that an Optimum Vented Box is -   external box dimensions: 14.5" x 16.5" x 17.5"   gross internal volume: 1.8 ft3   slot vent area: 19.5in2 (13" x 1.5")   slot vent length: 27in   vent displacement 0.46ft3   net internal volume: 1.15ft3   27hz, 5.8dB, 32hz      I want to build this box for the sub...then build an extra box that attaches to the left side of it (it will be facing my trunk) on the opposite side of the port that will be separated with a wall on the inside (it will be like an extension) this extra part of the box is going to be for the amp to be placed on top and it will make the box longer so it takes up the full width of my trunk which looks better than a single small 12" box...      I'm wondering before i start building is if the extra hollow box that will be attached, but separated from the box that the sub is actually in, will be bad for the performance or if it wont matter at all and will just be some cool custom building...      Also another question is that Ive seen larger boxes with one type x in them in pictures and on youtube...larger than what the manual suggests...will this be better for the sub, because i do want a larger box for my trunk...if that's true then i wouldn't put a wall in between the extra part of the box and i would just build a larger box...im interested in that but i would need the new dimensions of a perfect larger box for the type x..................THANKS A LOT FOR HELPING ME OUT  FROM ONE CAR AUDIO LOVIN PERSON TO ANOTHER HAHA..................

20090309193920AAYJCO4	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Custom Box for Alpine Type X 12"  I'm building one, got some questions...Thank You...?	Alright so i just bought a brand new Alpine Type X 12" sub and i have the manual it comes with with all the correct info on it -   It states that an Optimum Vented Box is -   external box dimensions: 14.5" x 16.5" x 17.5"   gross internal volume: 1.8 ft3   slot vent area: 19.5in2 (13" x 1.5")   slot vent length: 27in   vent displacement 0.46ft3   net internal volume: 1.15ft3   27hz, 5.8dB, 32hz      but i would like a larger box because it looks better to take up room in my trunk......when building a box often the factory specifications are absolutely design specific to the sub but the most important part is the cubic volume of air the enclosure takes up more then the dimensions so when you see boxes on youtube that look bigger sometimes this is because certain trunks can't fit boxes of exact specs and the builder needs to sacrifice height for width to allow the sub to perform in his/her car other times it is because some people think bigger boxes = better and this is silly cause a box that is too big will make the driver preform poorly if there is too much air to displace same thing with a box that is too small...      but then what about this box i found which is stated on ebay made for the type x (click the link)       http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vie...       with dimensions of   Dimensions (W x H x D): 30" x 13.5" x 16"    2.0 cu. ft.

20090309204523AAvCs4G	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What can I do about slippy gears on a 1994 Honda Accord Wagon? Transmission flush?	It's an automatic. The transmission is there, all gears work, but it's having trouble shifting. Sometimes during shifting, it doesn't fall on to the next gear and the revs go up as if it slipped. The best way to help it is to ease of the gas when it's about to switch to the next gear. I noticed the gears shift better when the car is colder and has been parked overnight. However the problem comes back if I need to go faster and the RPMs are higher, and when I get off the highway where I've been cruising on 4th gear for over 20 minutes.      Went to the auto-part looking for transmission fluid thinking it was needed. The auto-part specialist said it might be metal residue in the gearbox mixed with old pasty transmission fluid that makes it slip, not letting the transmission fall into gear. He told me not to use anything "not Honda quality" or additives at all. Instead he recommended a "transmission flush" before I start panicking about a very costly new transmission.      I'm aware the prices for a transmission flush go from $75 to $200 depending on the car make and model. This is a high mileage car at 150k+. Should this also be a consideration?      This 16 year old car has been with me half it's life and it's been very good to me. Saves gas and the wagon design is great to haul stuff. It's taken me many places and taken me to the same place many times. I really can not sell it to buy another one at the moment.

20090309203633AAecHrI	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1987 Supra Turbo won't turn over?	This car normally starts with no probably and the starter sounds strong.  Today it was snowing here in Washington.  I drive to work like usual today.  When I go back to my car and stick my key in the door the stock car security alarm goes off as soon as I turn the key.  This is only supposed to go off if the car is forcefully opened without a key or if the battery is disconnected while the system is active.  I get in and put the key in the ignition to stop the alarm.  Alarm stops.  I turn the key and nothing.  I look and when I turn the key the Rear Light Failure Light, Engine Electrical Problem and Battery Discharge light come on.  These lights come on when I attempt to start the vehicle but not while in the ACC position.  The starter will not turn.  I attempted to get a jump start but had the same results then as well.  I was able to still turn on the radio or any other power options while this is going on.      I was thinking that maybe this could be a solenoid problem or a lose wire or maybe the starter.

20090309203005AAoXhMb	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	96 Dodge Grand Caravan shaking?	My '96 dodge grand caravan has been shaking when accelerating for a few months now. It only happens when I am accelerating, but not when I am coasting. It still shakes a little bit when I am just maintaining a consistent speed but not nearly as much.      The shaking usually does not start until about 35 mph. The faster I accelerate, the more it shakes (but this is not always the case). Once I get to about 60 mph, there will be no shaking when maintaining a consistent speed and very little when accelerating.      Any ideas what this could be (the transmission has already been looked at) and it was determined that was not the cause)?

20090309200456AAMqzRp	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Can I cancel my car insurance right after an accident?	Long story short, a relative totaled her car rear-ending another vehicle. She had the bare minimum liability insurance through Geico which should be sufficient because the car she hit was barely damaged (no medical injuries either).      Question: Once the other party she hit files the claim can she cancel her auto policy? No reason to keep paying for insurance on a car that will never be driven again. I am assuming as long as she was insured on the date of the incident, all expenses (within the scope of her coverage limitations) stemming from that incident will be covered, even if more claims come up later.      BTW her car is totaled because it's a very old Volvo that will be too expensive to repair. All it needs is a front panel, hood, and radiator but she won't have the money to do the repair.

20090227134109AAFNoFv	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	Who has been building trucks the longest?	simple question iv been seeing someone ranting about this so here goes;From the time Henry Ford partially assembled and sold his first truck in 1900-three years before the Ford Motor Co. (Dearborn, Mich.) was founded in 1903-The bulk of production from 1900 to 1917 went to fill customer demand for Model T cars. Although Ford built commercial vehicles before 1917-a panel delivery truck, Model C delivery vans, and Model T commercial vehicles-they were actually cars converted to commercial use using after-market bodies supplied by many small companies. The history of the Dodge truck . From the very first model, built by The Dodge Brothers Company in 1918 and modeled after Ford's Model T, taken from wikipedia ford made more g-p utility vehicles during the second world war and the f-150 has been the top seller since 1948 to present so here the question if this information is freely available on the internet why dont people research they answers first?also who made the first diesel over the road truck? please provide a link thanks Best answer gets 10 points

20090309194712AAKoGeQ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Rough idle while in gear on '97 Ford Taurus?	In December I had to repair my head gasket (which was probably my own stupid fault and not the cars).  After they worked on it they said I needed to replace my spark plugs and wires because it "skipped/missed" while idling.  I told them it never done that before but I didn't press the issue because I figured when the head gasket went out, maybe it messed up the spark plugs & wires.  Just now had the money to replace them but after taking it to another garage who run a diagnostic, they told me the problem was NOT the spark plugs & wires but something "internal" and to take it back to who had done the head gasket work.      I called and they told me to bring it in Friday and they would look at it but I was looking for some input before I take it back.  It drives fine and will idle fine in park.  The problem is while idling in drive (like at a red light) it feels like it's "missing/skipping".  The RPM's dip down and back up while you feel it doing this.  It never dies, just acts like it might.  The people that run the diagnostic said it showed no codes even though the check engine light is on.      ??  Any input is appreciated.  I know nothing about cars and I'd like to walk in there this time and not sound like an idiot and be taken advantage of.

Alright here it is, ive read countless threads about it, but still not sure, i have 6 hifonics 12s in sealed enclosures the subs are only 300 rms power handling and the sealed enclosures are only 1 cubic ft per sub, i was wandering if a vented enclosure with 4 of the 12s which is 1.4 cubic ft per sub(fairly small vented enclosure) would put out more bass than the 6 12s in smaller sealed enclosures, and the other question is the amp pushing them is a kicker zx 1000.1 i have it wired(subs r dvc's) 250x2, and 125x4, so the amp is stable at 2 ohms, if i went with vented it would do 250x4, is that too much power for the hifonics in a vented enclosure since they r rated at 300rms(i rarely turn it up loud, just like being able to probably play it loud about 20 minutes a day....plz help

(check gauges light comes on)      The knocking is only very noticeable at low rpms and idling. On the highway its pretty much fine.      Any opinions, suggestions, comments, diagnostics?      What would be the cost-efficient thing to do?

To cut a long story short, I bought an 04 reg fiesta flame in December and it has intermittently not started first time. The weather doesn't seem to be an issue, nor whether the engine is cold or warm. I've taken the car back to the garage that I bought it from who have said that the diagnostic computer reported no problems and the car started 1st time for them all day and unless the fault happens while the car is with them they can't do anything.      I've done a few internet searches and some forums are reporting the the crankshaft TDC sensor could be the problem (but on a Renault Megane). Is it possible that this could be the problem on my Fiesta?      Thanks, Andrea
