For example, port 80 is what's used for web pages, 21 for FTP, 25 for email, and so on. Each program that runs on a computer will use one or more ports over the internet to communicate. <br>  <br>  Now if you want to know what ports are being used on your computer, in that same command window (the dark one you pulled up using START, RUN, CMD), type in netstat -a and it will give you a long list of all the other computers or other devices you're connected to and which ports of yours are using it.

0HQj5wnVaa	Pc is not maintenance-free devices. It’s not as simple as just power them up and go. Every pc, over time, will require routine maintenance to optimize pc performance and to avoid registry processing errors.<br>  <br>  The registry is a directory of system settings and options. As modifications are made to the pc configuration in the framework of hardware and software additions or upgrades, the registry is altered. Sometimes these alterations may clash with the current system.<br>  <br>  As time goes by, registry changes accumulate. There is significant risk of incompatibilities between the file processing. These issues translate into performance drawback that typically explodes overtime. To avoid the damage, it is necessary to cleanup registry file.<br>  <br>  Manual repair and maintenance of the registry is an extremely complex task that only the most technically inclined should take on or you run the risk of losing critical data and personal information or even worse end up with a computer that doesn't work at all. With the proper software, however, registry repair becomes a relatively stress free task that will improve your PC's performance without going round the twist and losing one's mind.<br>  <br>  Symptoms a pc registry repair is needed<br>  <br>  Performance issues that indicate the need for pc registry repair typically worsen and become more frequent over time. Once a registry repair is applied, however, there is a noticeable improvement in performance.<br>  <br>  Common issues that indicate a need for windows registry repair include (but are not limited to):<br>  <br>  You are having slow computer problems.<br>  Windows setting change unexpectedly.<br>  Shut down is slow and usually with error message.<br>  Anti-virus and spyware software didn't repair the issues.<br>  There are crashes and continuous computer freezes.<br>  The computer starts slow.<br>  Rebooting the computer is becoming a consistent problem.<br>  Errors specifically pinpoint a problem.<br>  There is an inability to properly add and remove software on PC.<br>  There is the "Blue Screen of Death.".<br>  The computer is experiencing lengthened response times.<br>  Computer internet is slow.<br>  Program launches are delayed.<br>  <br>  If you are experiencing a good portion of the problems above, there is definitely the need for an XP registry repair.

When you complete your merge, it will merge only the records selected (the "Yes" people) and you should be good to go.<br>  <br>  As you add more "yes" people, just exclude those you've already merged by deselecting the ones you don't want to merge.<br>  <br>  If you need a detailed explanation of exactly how to perform mail merge wirh Word 2003 and Excell 2003, check out my profile and look for a recent answer I gave on how to do mail merge.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	Well first of all you have your spreadsheet all backwards.<br>  <br>  Each guest should have a row, not a column.<br>  <br>  Now the easiest way to only get the one's that are yes is to filter your spreadsheet and then copy the results to a new page.

AA11703028	hi mate<br>           as you can see the graphic requirements for the sims are not that demanding however as with any game you want to be able to max out the resolution and detail to fully enjoy the game in question<br>           your current card the radeon 9200 wont support the "sims" since it only supports pixel and shader model 1.1 were as the "sims" requires a minimum of shader model 2.0<br>           however you can easily get a decent graphic card for under ￡50 that will run the "sims" at decent detail levels and resolution<br>           and since the radeon 9200 was only released in "agp" this is the type of card you need to be looking for<br>            a excellent agp gaming card is the Sapphire ATI Radeon HD 3650 512MB AGP( <a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Components/Graphics+Cards/AGP/ATI+Radeon+3000+Series/Sapphire+ATI+Radeon+HD+3650+512MB+AGP+?productId=33233)" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...</a> and this is ideal for the game in question,it has some excellent specs including a 725mhz core clock and 512mb of ddr2 memory running at 500mhz(1000mhz ddr effective) and with a 128bit memory interface you have a reasonably priced card that will run the "sims" very well<br>            as a more budget priced offering theres the "ATI Radeon X1650 Pro 512MB AGP"( <a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Components/Graphics+Cards/AGP/ATI+Radeon+X1600+Series/ATI+Radeon+X1650+Pro+512MB+AGP+?productId=29190" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...</a> ),and since this supports shader model 3.0 it will happily run the sims no probs<br>            it has a 500mhz core clock and 512mb of ddr2 memory running at 400mhz(800mhz ddr effective) and with a 128bit memory bus interface this makes a good budget gaming card<br>             also in the budget price range theres the "Club 3D ATI Radeon HD 2400PRO 512MB AGP"( <a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Components/Graphics+Cards/AGP/ATI+Radeon+2000+Series/Club+3D+ATI+Radeon+HD+2400PRO+512MB+AGP+?productId=35240" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...</a> )<br>                this is one of the few agp cards that support direct x 10 and shader model 4.0 so for more recent games this is the card for you<br>                it has a 525mhz core clock and 512mb of gddr2 memory clocked at 400mhz(800mhz ddr effective) ,this is a excellent allround card only let down by the slower 64bit memory interface,however with games like the "sims3" the 2400pro would be ok<br>                  any of these will run the sims3 however the radeon HD3650 is your best bet,followed by the radeon x1650pro<br>                  any problems let me know<br>                         good luck mate !

Nvidia is my personal choice as their cards are commonly alot better built than ATI and last alot longer. From what i looked up the two cards are fairly equal with the Nvidia one edging out on top. Nvidia is just my personal gamers choice though, both are farely good cards.<br>  <br>  As for COD4 you can easily use either card to run at low graphics, possibly even use both to run at normal graphics as well. Based on the requirments of the game your going to need alot of RAM however, 1 gig for XP and 1.5 gigs for Vista at minimal.

The disks are from different region and to play them you had to change the region code, which you did on computer, but you didn't change the region code on your regular DVD player. Some players allow you to do it, some don't (depends on a model and how old the player is.) Look in the manual of your player if this can be done on yours. If your particular player doesn't allow region codes to be changed, you cannot watch DVDs from Europe on it.<br>  By the way, you'll need to change back the code on your laptop, when you want to play American made DVDs on the laptop.|`|MGyzOIKqaa	Itss a region problem.

I just find that the other person is spending more time talking to his/her partner or someone they fancy rather than me or anyone else so its pointless even bothering sometimes|`|SXrNVQbFaa	I just hit the age where like no one goes on MSN anymore..

The only way I have found to fix this issue is to load your Windows installer CD into your CD-ROM drive and load up to the point where it asks if you want to install windows or repair it. Your looking to repair(obviously).<br>  <br>  From there it should bring you to a DOS-like propmt where you will have to repair the MBR.

Therefore, you are going to have to start from scratch in learning it. It WILL be well worth it in the end!!! I've been researching Linux for just over two years now and have been using PCLinuxOS 2007 for right at a year and I'm here to tell you that it can be HARD at times ...but WELL _*WORTH IT*_ in the long run!!!!!<br>  <br>  Here's what you need to do:<br>  <br>  Make sure that you made a BOOTABLE CD. That is, a CD that you can run the OS from your CD-ROM instead of your hard drive. That way you can TRY it out FIRST before trying to install it. You may have to re-set your BIOS to boot from CD-ROM in addition to the hard drive to do this. OR have someone who knows what they're doing with a BIOS do that for you. If you didn't get a bootable cd made properly, then to obtain one from your chosen distro you can buy one EXTREMELY cheaply or even obtain one for FREE from someone at a Linux User Group (read on!).<br>  <br>  After you've decided that you want this particular distro, you have three choices:<br>  <br>  1. Replace your current OS completely with it. (NOT recommended for newbs like us!)<br>  <br>  2. Set up a dual-boot system that will allow both OSes to reside on the same hard drive, but be used independently.<br>  <br>  3. Get another computer to LEARN Linux on. It doesn't have to be new. (This is what I have done so far. I have my PCLOS installed on an old Compaq Presario 1800.)<br>  <br>  Since you don't give a lot of info I can't really go much further than this. If you add more info I (or someone else) might be able to help you figure out what is going on.<br>  <br>  In the mean time I want you to go to this website <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.linux.org/groups/" rel="nofollow">http://www.linux.org/groups/</a><br>  <br>  and find a Linux User Group (LUG for short) near you to attend so you can get personalized help from ppl who can work with you and your computer to get you set up. My LUG has been INVALUABLE to me!!!!!
q5Tc9wziaa	This isn't the easiest thing to do, so what I would do is have a "continue" box that is covered by several rectangles. Each time you click one of the correct letters, trigger one of the rectangles to disappear. That way, say if the word was "potato" then you could make four boxes, one to disappear on P, one on A, T, and O. After clicking each of these letters, the word is solved, and the "continue button" is revealed on screen. Make sense?

AA11071711	From Google themselves, here is the explanation.<br>  <br>  "IE7 is a JavaScript library to make Microsoft Internet Explorer behave like a standards-compliant browser. It fixes many HTML and CSS issues and makes transparent PNG work correctly under IE5 and IE6."<br>  <br>  Basically, old versions of Internet Explorer have lot of quirks. For instance, PNG images support transparency and alpha-blending, but old versions of Internet Explorer require you write Javascript to make transparency work. Google encapsulated all these fixes into one Javascript library.|`|wXxIaLyxaa	That is a code for google analytics, at the bottom of the page there should be more code included with it|`|c4f45cb3208d42f175407510ca9d9c07aa	The code looks at what browser your using and if it is Internet Explorer 6 then the java code will act as a CSS interpreter and etc...   (IE 7 has better CSS converters so that is why)|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	I call it "Microsoft's confession of guilt".  It allows web developers to insert code (HTML, Javascript, CSS) to make a perfectly-functioning website, that looks like garbage in IE, look almost good in IE.  That particular code is using a particular Javascript file if the browser is IE6, because their normal Javascript - the one that runs just fine in sane browsers - does something weird in IR6.<br>  <br>  Many of us are keeping a very close eye on usage statistics and, as the balance tips to less than 50% (even if it's 49.999%) of IE 6 and 7 users, we're dropping IE support.  It takes a lot of effort (read, costs our clients a lot of money) to support Microsoft's idea of a browser.

But there is never information that says John Doe visited this website.<br>  <br>  Now that being said, an IP address can be traced back to the exact computer it came from, and a person can be identified (the owner of the computer/internet connection where the computer is located).  However, from what I know, a court order or subpeona must be issued to the ISP for a trace to be allowed.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	They can see that IP address, at least.

If you get your IP from your ISP dynamically, then they likely can't find you specifically.|`|T17pbHVJaa	What do you mean by their content?<br>  <br>  Files that they have available to download?

SkpRC2Nmaa	A screen name (screenname or s/n) is a name that uniquely identifies a user within an online system, instant messaging software, platform roleplay games and other Internet-based environments.<br>  <br>  The term started out as screen name (two words), but in recent years, the usage of the single-word form screenname has been  increasing. The abbreviation “sn” can also mean an online screen name.<br>  <br>  Screen names are often pseudonyms or first names, many times complemented by extra numbers, letters, or other characters to disambiguate them from users with similar screen names on the same system; this practice is increasingly common as the popularity of online environments grows.<br>  <br>  How much a screen name means in reference to its owner usually depends on number of accounts, and length of use. When a person uses the same identity for multiple services, then it probably means something to them personally, such as a nickname or a running joke. People who are not able to obtain their desired screen name on a popular service make minor typographical changes to the name by adding numbers or changing spelling, resulting in a multitude of usernames like ‘Dela54r4h5′ and ‘will0wRick’.<br>  <br>  Substituting numbers for certain letters is called Lookalike or l00k4lik3, because the numeric characters visually resemble the alphabetic ones and the name is still readable.<br>  <br>  If you have completely ran out of screen name ideas, there are several websites that help you generate new name ideas randomly. Some examples from an online Screen Name Generator are the following:<br>  <br>  4l3xTab, CaesDressy, FelBeach, InfernoEamon, MorlyDemon, R0d30Lang, SephTin, VividN0bl3, 5illyPat, CandyParke, FeliAlone, IvennGoofy, MortNyc, RacingYul3, SergeSteen, VkDamia, AbrAnnon, CheeBour, FielToxic, JandDonald, MuchDua, RamonXmc, SincGr4nt, WaldMyh3r0, AlfyBoz, ChikSkyl, FitzW4v3, JeffeIam, N3dyTao, RamoX0×0x, SlashKende,  AmirSchool, ClauLovely, ForeverFarre, JeremMo, NascarTha, RecipeHold, SlipkKais, WinnCutie<br>  <br>  If you wish to get more personalized results, just enter some words into the three textboxes - for example your name, your favorite pet, your hobby.<br>  <br>  Try it yourself.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://nameideas.wordpress.com/2006/10/18/how-to-find-good-screen-name-ideas/" rel="nofollow">http://nameideas.wordpress.com/2006/10/1...</a>

The advantage is that if you ever need to change TheMath to return something calculated, or pulled from a database, all your code remains exactly the same, since everyone calling your class called the property instead of the member variable.|`|oNJPw4P5aa	I dont use C# but I think string is in lower case not String

DjGEJfaPaa	If you deactivate your account from the "Deactivate Account" section on the Account page, your profile and all information associated with it are immediately made inaccessible to other Facebook users. What this means is that you effectively disappear from the Facebook service. However, if you want to reactivate at some point, your profile information (friends, photos, interests, etc.) is saved, and your account will look just the way it did when you deactivated if you decide to reactivate it. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and expect their information to be there when they return to the service.<br>  <br>  If you do not think you will use Facebook again and would like your account deleted, this can be taken care of for you, but keep in mind that you will not be able to reactivate your account or retrieve any of the content or information you have added. If you would like your account permanently deleted with no option for recovery, please submit your request here.

dca582dcac9ba5d7f83b88ba006f4da0aa	LOL! Great question had a little groundhog day there myself (it happens to the best of us when we discover a new language or way of doing things!)<br>  <br>  It like everything in life, it does get easier in time and with practice and with practice comes knowledge and experience. If you stick with it you will one day look back and laugh at (hopefully posts like this as I have) and smile because it sounds just like me when I first started! :D<br>  <br>  Variables<br>  <br>  Think of variables as boxes to put stuff into and depending on the type depends on the size of the box.<br>  <br>  A type of "box" but instead of being on your computer its on the Servers (usually in memory)...<br>  <br>  Which takes me nicely onto DIM which means a declaration in memory (which is what I just described a variable to mean! How nifty!<br>  <br>  strItem is simply a method of naming varibles (boxes in memory) in this case he's preceeded the "Item" with str short for string aka just text.<br>  <br>  Its considered good practice as just looking at the varible name you know what type it is. It comes into its own when you're comparing or doing something to them because you know what conversion to do without checking etc...<br>  <br>  Record sets are just sets of records (lol?) in a database (or some other form there's lots of different methods of storing data nowadays but because you said DSN I suspect he meant a database recordset)  which brings me nicely onto DSN or Data Source Name its a text file or registry entry that points to a database which stores all the details of it (see link for a better description).<br>  <br>  It quite hard to give you some words of encouragement because it does get harder and then when you think you've got it sussed it either gets a lot harder or they bring out yet another language to learn or a new technology you need to use\learn its almost endless. There's one thing I can say if you do stick with it and end up liking\loving it can be really rewarding. If not no problem just do something else! :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	People fall into two classes - right-brained (artistic) and left-brained (analytical).  (Until we develop a third half of the brain, anyway.)  If you're artistic, you can design a great-looking web page, but you can't grasp the very basics of programming.  If you're analytical, you can understand programming easily, but even though you know a great-looking web page when you see it, you couldn't design one if your child's life depended on it.  (The last person to be great at both was named Leonardo da Vinci.)<br>  <br>  Don't try to be what you're not - if you're a great designer, stick to design.  If you're analytical, start by learning programming - ASP is jumping head first into the shallow end of the pool before learning to get wet.

AA11613202	I found this on RipOffReport.com:<br>  <br>  I was invited to visit dell.v-bux.com to complete free trial offers. In exchange for completing the trial offers my referrer agreed to cover the expenses of any processing fees and/or shipping and handling charges plus a small stipend.<br>  <br>  I completed five offers at dell.v-bux.com on April 2, 2007. Each offer was valued between 19% and 22% credit. Between them all I had completed enough offers to earn 100% credit. Unfortunately, I was not rewarded with 100%+ credit, but only credited for three offers for 61% credit.<br>  <br>  I submitted a help ticket and missing credit reports for the remaining offers I had not received credit for. I was told by support that I should expect a response anywhere from 2 hours to 31 days. I was also told that I was not required to do anything else but wait it out.<br>  <br>  On April 4, 2007 I received credit for an offer I thought had failed when I initially had completed it. I considered this a turn of good fortune and that it meant I only needed one of the remaining two offers to clear.<br>  <br>  On April 16, 2007 frustrated by the lack of progress and communication from v-bux, I completed another offer that should have provided me the remaining 19% credit. I was careful to follow every instruction v-bux provided to assure that I would receive credit for the offer and still I did not receive credit.<br>  <br>  I again contacted v-bux support and was told I should still wait on my other offers.<br>  <br>  From here out, v-bux did nothing but put me off and continue to tell me to wait and that it was out of their hands. They put the blame on their publishers and affiliates.<br>  <br>  Finally, I was told they were meeting with their publishers last Friday (5/18/07) and that they would use my difficulties as an example. V-Bux told me they couldn't promise I would receive credit as a result of the meeting, but they would try.<br>  <br>  Following the meeting, V-Bux support questioned my integrity and claimed that I must have been involved in something fraudulent because their publishers all claimed I was denied due to 'poor lead quality'. V-Bux's solution was to offer me the opportunity to re-sign up with any of their sites and they would waive the credit requirements so all I would need to do would be to refer other suckers to their site.<br>  <br>  The problem with this solution is that it screws the person that originally referred me out of my credit<br>  as well. It also means that I am screwed out of the fees and shipping and handling charges I paid for the original offers because my referrer and I agreed he would pay me after I had received my credit.<br>  <br>  Just a warning, people. You can't get something for nothing. V-Bux claims to pay out over 90% off their members. As one of the apparent 10% that got screwed, I can tell you it sucks. Don't bother with v-bux.

AA10016890	Well there's the quick and dirty way or there's the right way. I'm assuming that you're not just talking about "a bunch of strings" but actually are dealing with pathnames. <br>  <br>  The quick and dirty way starts like this:<br>  <br>  >>> "/home/user/foo/bar".split("/")<br>  ['', 'home', 'user', 'foo', 'bar']<br>  <br>  You pass the separator, "/", to the string's split method. This gives you a list of the strings that were separated by the given string. You get a zero-length string at the start because the first "/" was between a zero-length string and "home". Then you have to figure out which parts you want to drop and so on.<br>  <br>  The better (and portable) way to do this is by using Python's os.path module. Here's a nice way that you could do that:<br>  <br>  >>>paths = ['/home/user/foo/bar',<br>  ...??'/home/user/foo/foo2',<br>  ...??'/home/user/foo/foo2/foo3']<br>  >>>prefix = os.path.commonprefix(paths)<br>  >>> import string<br>  >>> map(lambda s: string.replace(s, prefix, ''), paths)<br>   ['bar', 'foo2', 'foo2/foo3']<br>  <br>  The code above is probably trashed. Check out <a href="http://codepad.org/heDFDKUs" rel="nofollow">http://codepad.org/heDFDKUs</a> for the full code.

onVUS2fGaa	What exactly is your question? Are you looking to learn Java to modify the code or do you just want to run/play the game? In either case you're going to need to download the Java Development Kit to get the Java compiler (javac) because the zip files do not have any pre-compiled java class files. If you want to modify the code, I would recommend also downloading an Integrated Development Environment like Eclipse or NetBeans. There are many resources on the Internet where you can teach yourself to program in Java, like www.exampledepot.com.<br>  If you want to just run the game, compile the .java files and run java DSpiresServer (for the server) and java DragonSpiresFrame (for the client).

If your system is set to boot to floppy first and you have a non-O/S disk in the drive you'd get this error.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, it sounds like your hard drive is either dead, or the operating system install on it is corrupt.<br>  <br>  If the hard drive is dead, you'll need to replace it and do a reinstall of Windows.<br>  <br>  If you have a corrupt o/s, you'll need to do a Windows reinstall or recovery, depending on your machine.
ab7abc9c4391dba8740bf31b0b7bf5eaaa	it sounds like that either the connection inside the plug is broken so as they have a molded plug it needs replacing, if that does not work you would need to open up the speakers where the green cable goes in as the cable has a break in it somewhere and as you move it it makes enough connection to get the sound back again. if you don't know how to replace the plug or cable take it to an electronics technician unless they are still under warranty then have them repaired because if the plug is not wired up correctly it will either have no sound or the left and right sides will be back to front. if you have to get somebody else to change it it would probably cost just as much to repair them as it would to replace

I installed Google Chrome [an alternative to internet explorer] and using that I can now save downloaded files, but if you're having the same problem as me, you'll need to download it from another computer & copy it to yours.<br>  <br>  My main suspect for this problem is a recent Windows update but I can't confirm this at the time of writing - is windows update active on your computer?

aj5IBTuXaa	OK, a couple of things come to mind.<br>  <br>  First, your hard drive might come with a separate diskette or CD that contains specialty drivers.  (I hope not, but it could happen.)  If so, you need to run that.<br>  <br>  Second, you need to find this path (which in this case is the WinXP path) - but this or something like it has to exist on Vista, too.<br>  <br>  Start >> Settings >> Control Panel >> Administrative Tools >> Device Management >> Disk Management<br>  <br>  When in the disk manager, you can initialize and assign partitions for your new drive.  It will format the drive according to one of three possible formats:  FAT(16), FAT32, or NTFS.  If this is a WinXP or Vista, choose NTFS.  If this is a very old machine with a really old version of Windows on it, NTFS might not be an option.  (But that would be an awfully old version.)  In which case FAT32 is a poor 2nd choice.  <br>  <br>  You can choose to partition the drive.  If it is less than 100 Gb, I wouldn't bother.  If it is more than 160 Gb then it MIGHT make sense to split it into two 80 Gb partitions.  Might not.  That's your call.<br>  <br>  Advantage to splitting into two partitions?  Data isolation.  If you assign one partition to games and another to some sort of data, then filling up one partition doesn't affect the other.  Another advantage?  Smaller allocation units on smaller partitions, so less wasted space at the end of each file (a.k.a. slack space).<br>  <br>  Advantage to not splitting?  Maximizes the availability of the drive.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you what to do on that point.  I know that I split my 200 Gb drive into two partitions, one for photos and one for games.  I'm content with that decision.  But everyone is different on preferences.<br>  <br>  Once you have chosen the format you want and the partition layout, you tell disk manager to go ahead and implement your request.  You do that from the disk manager display that shows each disk.  Right-click to get a drop-down.  One of the options is FORMAT.  Do that only after you have decided what you want to do with the drive.|`|Snwfwx73aa	All i did was connect it like the your other hard drive is connected. worked for me- Goodluck|`|WJ7pRtD3aa	well first you have to make sure you have the jumpers are right on the back of the HD, (little black clip)<br>  <br>  (talking about ide hd's, but I'm sure sata drives have them as well)<br>  <br>  so when you boot up go into bios and make sure the HD is being recognized.. if not you have to change the jumpers around... <br>  <br>  other than that, assuming your just installing a slave drive... all you do is use the supplied disk to format the drive.. if your using the drive as your master.. then you need to of course install windows, and you have to have all your drivers: ex. video, sound, ethernet...<br>  <br>  <br>  so for the jumpers: if it is going to be a backup (slave) drive the jumper should be on 'slave' or 'cable select'|`|uGUvct02aa	If this is going to be the primary drive, you need to consider formatting, operating system, drivers etc.  If this is just a secondary drive, just make sure that the jumpers are set to the correct setting (probably slave drive) so that the computer doesn't look to that drive to boot from.

cfdaafe195dbe3394c7aba2b49ed9576aa	Basically, you take a color image in one layer, duplicate the layer, convert the top layer to black and white.  <br>  <br>  Then apply a layer mask to the black and white layer (Layer > Layer Mask > Reveal All - there are other ways to get it, but that's simplest to write out).<br>  <br>  The layer mask should be white.  Use a black paint brush to paint over where you want the color to show through.  Painting black on the white mask shows what's underneath.  The benefit to this over the eraser is that if you make a mistake, just switch to white paint and paint over the area you want to cover up.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you're painting on the *mask*, not on the layer itself (click on the mask in the layers pallet first if you're not sure - though it's pretty obvious if you paint a white line on the image vs. if the color shows through from below).

Mp9Q9An4aa	Assuming and average of 100mb per album [you didn't mention file size or bit rates] you could copy 180 albums to 4 or 5 recordable DVDs, but in the long term I think you'd be better off investing in an external hard drive, that way you can keep all your important files in one place that's safe until USB becomes obsolete. As the previous answer stated, if you don't have that computer anymore, you're kinda screwed unless you've kept the hard drive containing your music files.<br>  <br>  EDIT: There is a program that enables you to transfer your music back to a PC from an ipod but I don't know the details, because of issues like you're having now I wouldn't have an ipod if it was given to me.<br>  <br>  You could still use the DVD method but with 40GB you'll need 10 discs & some patience. If both PCs use the same type of hard drive you could attach the old drive to your new PC & copy your files, unfortunately most older PCs use EIDE whereas newer ones are using SATA so that's an unlikely option.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Copy them all to the disk.

When the download is 75 % on your computer and the owner of the pc from which frostwire is  uploading is switching off his or her computer, downloading will stop, until the computer is switched on again.  Sometimes you see, not enough sources. That means no computer is found with your song.

The best one that I can think of (within a somewhat reasonable price) would be a Mac Pro. You can have up to 8 gigs of memory, 4 terabytes of storage space, 24" flat panel screen. For the basic computer (3 gigs of memory, 640 gigs of storage) + screen + printer it is about $3,550. If you ask me, the Mac Pro is the best computer out there. I know it's on the expensive side, but it is well worth the money. I used to be a PC person until I got a MacBook for college. Now I would never go back to using a PC. And if you want, you can also run Windows on a Mac too. Apples hardware is a lot better than most PC clones.|`|5hM8w4tLaa	Unless you are doing heavy video editing and 3d animating, or are very into games do not bother getting a mac pro.

ebuxHnScaa	You aren't doing a good job of explaining your problem. What does "too strong for it" mean? What is a "weak CD player"?<br>  <br>  When a CD is described as "80 minutes" that means it can hold 80 minutes of sound at standard CD audio format. Obviously, if you're putting movies on it, they're not in standard CD audio format. So that "80 minutes" doesn't have anything to do with anything.<br>  <br>  If you want an audio CD to play in an audio CD player, you have to store the audio in a form that player supports. They all support standard CD audio format (the one that lets only 80 minutes fit). But most newer CD audio players will also support other formats, such as a directory filled with MP3 files.<br>  <br>  If you want the CD to fit only the 80 minutes it says, set your software to burn an "audio CD", and it will use the standard CD audio format that should work with almost all CD players.

8di5Wn3naa	Bad news. Microsoft removed macros and VBScript from Office 2008 for macs. Unless you can buy a version of Office 2004 or earlier, the only way to boss Microsoft Office around is by using Applescript.<br>  <br>  Another Idea, if Microsoft still supports it, is AutoText. You could format a line of text in a word doc, with all the spacing and styling you want, then save just that text as AutoText. Highlight your selection, click on Insert, AutoText, Add..., name your AutoText. Then when you want to insert it into your play, click on Insert, AutoText, <nameofyourAutoText> and it should insert the text just as you typed it.

dkpIjt5jaa	This question will bring you several answers, all in the form of "PCs (or Macs) are the best, this what I use !".<br>  <br>  Of course, that computer is the best for THEM not for YOU !<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is how to do more precise research to find the best one for YOU: The first step is to get information on the laptops that you are interested in and, as a second step, to search online at web stores (like Amazon or similar) or at retail shops (BestBuy, staples or similar) for the best deals on the ones you would really like to have based on your search.<br>  <br>  This way, you get the best working laptops at the best prices.<br>  <br>  <br>  As laptop specs change often, it is good to get non-vendor/non-partisan/non-groupie information so you should do some checking on these review/guide sites to help fine tune your search.<br>  <br>  At each site, start by checking models and then compare them with others (or against each other) by choosing different options using boxes and drop down menus to customize the search and get what you want in your laptop ( there is even a way on some of those sites to look by inputting the price you are willing to pay to minimize the impact on your wallet ).<br>  <br>  Your time will not be wasted (after all, you get all this from the comfort of your home) and you should find something to your liking and budget.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stop 01 here: <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr;snav" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr...</a><br>  Stop 02 here: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/products/computers/laptops.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/products/computer...</a><br>  Stop 03 here: <a href="http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?categoryId=3121" rel="nofollow">http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?c...</a><br>  Stop 04 here: <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notebookreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck on your research.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.: By the way, I really own a PC (an older Dell Dimension 4500) but also a Mac (an older iBook Graphite Special Edition) and I will get them replaced soon (I'm presently doing research) .|`|HZy629kLaa	Go for the Mac.  If you decide you need Windows at some point you can always install it with Bootcamp or Parallels.   The Mac will also have a higher resale value if you ever want to trade up.|`|24wL5Lrdaa	I personally would go straight to buying a PC without a thought towards the MAC.  But its all personal choice.  If youre going to school for media editing and video production the MAC is for you.  But then again PCs can have countless amounts of software that can imitate if not exceed mac applications.  PCs are the "comfort zone" of computers because they use the windows Operating System and thats what most people are used to. I dont know you so i cant possibly know what your used to or what you like but everyone i know uses a pc because they're compatable with everything.  MACs require a lot of programming to get them to connect to networks and printers.  PCs are already ready for networks.  I dont dislike MACs, because they do have a lot of cool things installed and they have lots of fun stuff to monkey with, but for a student a PC will be easier and more functional for school and work.   Thats my opinion i hope it helps.    <br>  <br>  Also, I dont know if your a computer guy or not, but PCs are much more upgradable than MACs.  If it matters thats another reason.|`|SlXiS37Jaa	That is easy, Mac all the way. <br>  The reason is because it way more convenient than the PC and that it faster, and energy - efficient.

F9S78wRkaa	It is likely that your internal cooling fan is either clogged or defective.  This is a common problem--they suck in a LOT of dust sometimes--or a piece of sucked-in tape or cellophane is acting like "a playing card in the spokes."  Another common problem is bad bearings, which can cause the fan blades to vibrate and rattle.<br>  <br>  The internal cooling fan will normally turn on when the temperature rises above a certain point--but it also kicks on for a few seconds under the circumstances you describe.<br>  <br>  You can try to blow out the vent with canned air.

8ca8be7f4582c735baa8ec960d2230c0aa	No you can NOT use a license key for one copy of Windows for another at all. You need to find out if that computer has a recovery console and make a recovery disc from that. OR, better yet, get a hold of the company you bought the computer from and tell them you want the CD that goes with your computer. One other thing you can try is to get a hold of MS and tell them what you're going through and see what they say.<br>  <br>  ****EDIT: Yes, you can get Linux for FREE!<br>  <br>  Look here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://distrowatch.com" rel="nofollow">http://distrowatch.com</a><br>  <br>  You can try out Linux distros from Bootable CD before installation to see it that particular distro meets your individual needs.<br>  <br>  To find out even more about Linux:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.linux.org/groups/" rel="nofollow">http://www.linux.org/groups/</a>|`|KgtI19bgaa	Yup, you can use the key for a valid version of windows ilustrated on that sticker.|`|hzYenQpYaa	no you can't it will not work.<br>  no cd or dvd for free yes free Linux Ubuntu
ZN686EhIaa	The disc is for you to use to rebuild the computer to the install state that it is in when it was shipped to you. So all the original files and system can be restored by that. Anything you now put on the computer or download to it will not be restored. The same with any programs you install. If you want to make a 'mirror copy' of everything on the hard drive you will need a program like Norton Ghost and possibly will need an external hard drive to make the copy to. You might also be able to ghost a copy onto a DVD. As long as you keep all the discs of programs you install or make back ups to either DVD, CD or USB, don't worry.|`|HYedOEbnaa	what you have is your recovery disk.  A back up is totally different.  If you want to back up your system go to start>all programs>accessories>system tools>backup.  But beware your looking at about 21/2 hours or so to do a full back up

If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.<br>  <br>  If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.<br>  <br>  As an experienced webmaster I recommend BlueHost service which I’m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements.

If you'll dedicate a full weekend to the effort, I promise you can figure it out through trial and error. I'm a social networking coach and I do NOT think individuals should pay for this kind of discovery. You can do it! Now, if you need it for marketing purposes, that's a different story. You'll likely need some help, then.|`|9SSO454taa	you will need a domain name for example bebo.com <br>  next you will have to have a home page <br>  the hard part is making sub domains each profile will be 1 sub domain plus you need to have it on auto pilot so when someone signs up to your site they get a sub domain so they can build there profile. you will need to go to go daddy and look for hosting that give you unlimited space also you got to get your self a server to hold everyone's information on it.<br>  <br>  there are programs that can help you start your site off, it is hard but not impossible maybe do web site design night classes.

dchG8cTJaa	Well, Boxxy first made 2 videos for her GaiaOnline (a game) buddies.<br>  But then some people posted her videos on a thread on 4chan (an imageboard website) titled as "You rage, you lose". So then she became so popular that it caused a 'civil war' on 4chan between her fans and haters.<br>  Then some retards who take the internet WAY too seriously, hacked (not really, just a password guess) and she was told not to make another video again.<br>  They also published her personal info like her name and last name (as they claim) even tho they say they didn't mean to publish it.<br>  So now it goes on.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't think she's annoying.<br>  She's pretty funny, cute and adorable.<br>  She didn't even ask for the fame tho.<br>  So **** is messed up.

ec0942b2c86d10be5df5e954d8bafc2daa	They pull a "hard inquiry" on your Credit Report.<br>  <br>  When I applied couple weeks ago, they pulled from Equifax, and I was approved with mid-600's credit score.<br>  <br>  The problem with answering your question is that BML doesn't give you a hard "credit limit". Rather, they make a decision whether to approve or decline the purchase at the time of purchase. <br>  <br>  So if it is a large purchase i.e. laptop, it is possible for the transaction to be declined. I suggest maybe you call them and ask them more in detail about whether a transaction that large is typically approved or declined.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, there aren't any major caveats to using Bill Me Later, as long as you remember to pay the bill on time.<br>  <br>  One thing I noticed though was they only allow you to pay off your balance using a checking account, therefore, you'll forgo any credit card rewards cash back or points when you use BML.<br>  <br>  from FAQ:<br>  I have a Bill Me Later account. Why was I declined for a purchase I attempted to make using Bill Me Later?<br>  <br>  Your purchase may be declined for many reasons. The following are the most common reasons a purchase is declined:<br>  <br>  # Your account is past due.<br>  # You are attempting to make a purchase larger than the amount of credit we can extend to you at this time. We do re-evaluate this regularly. As you establish a good payment record with Bill Me Later, you will have greater chances of being approved for each purchase you attempt.<br>  # A technical error on the merchant site.|`|lOZq7htXaa	If you get approved you will know immediately - probably via e-mail.<br>  <br>  Make you try for the student discount as well. You can put all his info in (name and school etc.) and the use your info for the purchase part.

7ZfGqo3qaa	You computer's system RAM is DDR - that has no bearing on the type of RAM your video card uses.  GDDR2 cards or even GDDR3 cards (if any existed in PCI) are fine. <br>  <br>  Between those two, the 8400GS is better.  The GeForce 6200 is decent, while the GeForce FX5200 is just obsolete junk. Another card you might want to consider is the Radeon HD 2400Pro.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131082" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  The absolute best PCI card is the GeForce 8500GT, but it's a little more expensive.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814187059" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  All of these cards can handle Counterstrike:Source- it even runs ok on some integrated video chipsets.

Not even a competition. Don't even consider the FX5200 for playing games!<br>  <br>  2) The memory on the video card (GDDR) has nothing to do with your system memory (DDR). Nothing to worry about there.<br>  <br>  3) Counterstrike Source is a pretty old game and will run perfectly. If you're not into the latest games, this card will do just fine. Just remember that this isn't a high-end card, so it'll have troubles with the more recent games. Check the link below for some benchmarks.|`|RRBv9zIVaa	First off, I'd need to know your price range, once I get that I can find a video card that will run fine you. The two you picked out are quite old, and for about twice as much as those you can get one that will run much better.|`|mbHZ10ZZaa	1) They are all pretty old, but the 8400gs is your best bet.<br>  <br>  2) Vram and System ram are completely different, it's fine to have ddr system ram and a ddr2 gpu.<br>  <br>  3) Yes, but with pretty limited frame rates.
a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	That number is hot for a hard drive, but keep in mind that most of that heat is generated by the CPU.<br>  <br>  Not to mention the fact that the sensor is rarely accurate.<br>  <br>  Your best option would be to use some canned air and spray out the exhaust vents on the side, bottom and back of the laptop.|`|kPK4Ch7haa	Those temperatures are actually in the normal range.  If you want to keep your drive and system cooler you might try installing laptop hardware control (freeware) and underclocking your system (I know, I know, but it will last longer and in some cases actually run better because it's cooler).<br>  Good Luck.

hGVXek1faa	Make sure your parts are compatible, check on vendor of each part and make sure it on their approved list. Example: Visit Asus and see if your RAM is on their QVL (Qualified Vendor List).<br>  <br>  Not a fan of AMD processors, you might want something a little more powerful for 3D rendering. I went with a 3.0ghz Quad Core and 1600mhz RAM for my 3D rendering and multitasking habits. <br>  <br>  The 4850 is known to run hot, make sure you have enough cooling. I went with the MSI 4850 for their heat sink. The 4850 is a good card for the money, if you have extra money then upgrade to a 4870 X2.<br>  <br>  The Corsair PSU's are nice, they have dedicated 12v rails, nice amps and clean power.<br>  <br>  When putting it all together, be very careful with static and follow the directions if this is your first time. Make sure there is no debris of any type between CPU and heat sink, I would suggest getting aftermarket thermo (Artic) and clean the pre-spread grease off. Read the directions to applying the grease, if done wrong it can effect cooling of cpu big time.<br>  <br>  For first boot up, leave all peripherals disconnected. This will help you troubleshoot any problems.<br>  <br>  After first boot, if you need to go back into computer, make sure you disconnect power from wall and hit the power button to discharge capacitors. You will notice lights cone on for a very brief time then die.<br>  <br>  When you have the computer put together and working, update the BIOS. This will fix compatibility between mobo and cpu if there are any. On my Asus board it didn't recognize my cpu and was saying it was running over 100°c.<br>  <br>  Go into BIOS and make sure things are set right, things like time, disable floppy if not using one, set up hard drives to use raid and so on.|`|ChBK5Lv9aa	For $1000-$1500, you should get a Core i7.

200745acbaf74a0a9974fd7593e0859caa	The 3 pin connector is just used to monitor speed if the motherboard supports it.It's not necessary for operation since the power supply has it's own built-in temperature sensor which controls fan speed.|`|ebuxHnScaa	I assume you are talking about a three-pin connector that goes from the power supply to the motherboard fan connector.<br>  <br>  If your power supply does not have one, then you obviously don't have to connect it, since it doesn't exist. (Your power supply does not have fan speed reporting.)<br>  <br>  If your power supply has one, and it only has one pin connected, you do not need to connect it. (Your power supply has fan speed reporting, which you can use or not at your option.)<br>  <br>  If your power supply has one, and it has all three pins connected, then you do need to connect it. (Your power supply has fan speed reporting, and powers its fan from an external source. Leaving this disconnected will keep the fan from spinning.)<br>  <br>  Note that you may need to adjust a setting in your BIOS to tell it not to monitor that fan connector. Otherwise, it may issue warning beeps because it thinks the fan isn't spinning. In most cases, you don't, because the monitoring is done in software. If a warning pops up about a fan speed below minimum, just click on the warning and find the way to disable it.|`|AA11703028	hi teena<br>                 should be ok,however make sure your pc has the required connectors but then again there are some inexpensive power supplys avalible online and you can get a decent model for less than ￡30<br>                for example the Xilence 480W Gaming PSU ( <a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Components/Power+Supplies/450w+to+499w/Xilence+480W+Gaming+PSU+?productId=19869" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...</a> ) is excellent value for less than ￡30 and has all the relevant connectors that are required on todays pc,s<br>                rated at 480watts the xilence psu has some nice features which include a 24pin motherboard connector which is backwards compatible to the 20pin motherboard connectors and with both pci-express and sata power connectors <br>                however allthough i normally warn against the cheap psu,s there are some decent models that would be ideal for your p.c and one such model is the 600W ATX SurgeControl Power Supply ( <a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Components/Power+Supplies/500w+%2B/600W+ATX+SurgeControl+Power+Supply?productId=22653" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...</a> ),and i recently purchased this psu for my wifes pc as i also bought a radeon HD2600x and up to now the 600watt psu has run well,however the only downside with these psu,s is the rated wattage,its very rarely correct and is more likely to be around 500watts<br>                   any problems let me know<br>                        good luck matthew !|`|uCzSEgT6aa	Most likely that 3 pin connector was only to allow the motherboard to monitor the speed of the  PSU fan so it could alert you if it failed.

I know for a fact that its anti-spyware is top notch so if you are looking for that type of protection, go for it.<br>  <br>  You looking for the BEST ANTI VIRUS... get Zonealarm anti virus or Norton anti virus. However, preventing viruses is really the best method to avoid them. So, I suggest you get a complete internet security and if money is really a small price to pay for your computer's health, I definetly suggest you get:<br>  <br>  Zonealarm EXTREME security-- its the most advanced and highly respected program that provides a firewall, anti virus, spam protection, parental controls... just about everything. It costs like $69.99 but its really a good deal considering you get the most effective product out there. Please get for your computer to protect from the Lastest threats. <br>  <br>  Lastly, DON'T LISTEN TO PEOPLES FREE VIRUS SCANNERS. Programs like AVAST OR AVG really do suck and are not effective. Also, because they are not FOR PAY programs, you run the into the chance that these very programs might contain viruses/spyware themselves.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|uuDloQnCaa	I'm not very familiar with Vipre so until its been throughly tested Id recommend using Avast.<br>  <br>  Avast Home Edition: <br>  <br>  Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do all this paid or otherwise and this is free.<br>  <br>  Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key this is valid for a year after which you just register for another free key, so it always free.<br>  <br>  I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then big names like Mcafee.<br>  <br>  Avast: <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Comodo: <a href="http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/</a><br>  <br>  People often recommend AVG but Avast is far better:<br>  <br>  On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not screen downloads for viruses (one of the most common ways of getting infected). I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning where as Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.|`|9cc9d1b1db5e5452f3279720cee18e87aa	There is no best.<br>  These AV`s are all free and good.

Graphics Design is a really good way to become a Web designer (Developer it's pretty much all the same).|`|YEo7vZ2uaa	HTML/CSS is not programming and is not computer science. Generally, web designers fall into one or the other (designer or developer). It's rare to have a combination of the two - create aesthetically pleasing design and write clean semantic mark-up. HTML/CSS is really not that difficult to learn and get a solid grasp of. Therefore, I would focus on graphic design as that's an area most web designers fail miserably on. If there's a web design major, definitely go for that as you'll learn more about designing for the web, such as usability and marketability of a website, whereas graphic design is more like art.|`|bx4R7wagaa	Well here is the thing: If u study Computer Programing, you would be able to code a website, but will not know a thing about designing (colors and layout stuff).

For an example: You will learn about HTML and basic CSS but not about PHP, ASP, Javascript, etc.<br>  <br>  Right now I have a bachelor in Graphic Design and I'm going to do a master in Publicity, and also I'm going to study a few additional courses and certifications in web design.|`|QztTytKbaa	Some web design firms use a graphic designer to come up with a visual layout, which is in turn "coded" by a programmer.<br>  <br>  It helps if you have a little formal training when it comes to coding, of course you could read up the basics yourself but it might take you awhile to get familiar with the different languages.<br>  <br>  Also consider if you are more inclined in design or programming (logic).<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Check in with any local office stores (Staples, Best Buy, Office Max etc...)

But as noted above, it does help to learn a bit of html, css, and general understanding of web site editing. This allows you to optimize layout and hopefully build a more enhanced site to attract and retain visitors. Visit about.com where there are many web site related tutorials.<br>  <br>  Maybe start with the popular free NVU. Then maybe start by signing up with a free host, e.g. Netfirms Basic or the popular 110mb host.  You can also create a web site easily with Weebly, Synthasite, Jimdo, and Webepags. Visit their web sites to review them, and sign in if you want.<br>  <br>  Then perhaps download and use a free template from one of many templates web sites, then upload your site to your free host (use a free FTP program to upload your site - e.g. Core FPT Lite. Then you can optimize for search engines, directories, etc, if you want. <br>  <br>  I use the free host, Netfirms, but their are restrictions, e.g. bandwidth, file upload size, file space size, no direct links to flash sites, etc, but has worked ok for me. Many free hosts require their company name to be added to your URL as a sub domain, (e.g. my site.their sub domain.com) and you may have to add one of their ads (link or banner) to your site. <br>  <br>  You could start with a blog as well, e.g. try the Google’s blogger or the advanced Wordpress (which you can add plugins for enhancement), or use the simple Google Page Creator (soon to be changed to Google Sites - You need a Gmail account) - easy to set up for a beginner. <br>  <br>  There are free (and easy) web site building tools, such as Weebly (Using drag and drop), Snap Pages (Good for sharing photos), and Edicy Pages (Various templates/themes similar to Blogger and Wordpress).<br>  <br>  Later on though, it might pay to learn html/JavaScript/PHP etc, which allows more flexibility to design and modify your web site. Then maybe upgrade to a paid host and domain, which will possibly yield more features (scripting features, higher bandwidth, increased storage space, email accounts, etc) and more ownership of your site...|`|ywYj0nQraa	There's no exact method.

2gjfFsYKaa	Well, Java doesn't guarantee that the garbage collector will ever be called during the program's lifetime even if you make explicite calls to System.gc() as you have. Typically, the garbage collector won't run unless the program needs more memory than it has. So, you may just have to live with your memory leak - if indeed it actually has one. The referenced article discusses this problem in some detail.|`|orO8scxvaa	The only real way to answer this is to thoroughly investigate the code for potential memory leaks.<br>  <br>  Some common causes are things like leaving data in Arrays, Lists, ArrayLists or other collections, and not explicitly disposing of them, or dereferencing them.  Instantiating objects with a very large amount of instance variables that are not eligible for garbage collection.<br>  <br>  The other possibility is that your app is simply overly large.<br>  <br>  Memory leaks are possible, even when disposing everything that the rule book says you're supposed to, because you could be using some thing that the rule book doesn't cover (This 'rule book' is hypothetical, by the way).<br>  <br>  All I can say is thoroughly investigate all of your code, and possibly even give it to your friend to look over.|`|Liflecjraa	sorry bout im a novice programmer too... trying to learn java from the start... ive learned c++ and pissed off because it is not a garbage collecting languge... i hope this links help<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-1996/jw-08-gc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  my blog: <a href="http://jdsalingersknowjava.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jdsalingersknowjava.blogspot.com</a>
7nimzIDsaa	No it will not auto overclock your ram.<br>  <br>  What others suggest is running your ram and processor at a 1:1 Ratio, you can check it out with CPU-Z. However a few things to note:<br>  <br>  1) Is your ram module overclockable or how much it can go, you have to find this out yourself, ain't hard just google for it<br>  <br>  2) If your worry about heat issues especially if your on value rams, do get a heat spreader.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend mobo with auto overclocking capability, the real overclocking starts from the bios itself. Overclocking is an art.<br>  <br>  Whether or not to start with an 800Mhz memory standard board isn't reall y the question here. You must find a board that is highly overclockable, i personally go for Asus R.O.G series.<br>  <br>  As mention earlier overclocking the processor will increase the performance as your final clockspeed will be fsb x multiplier. However to accomplish so, you have to increase the voltage to supply more power to cater to the new clockspeed. Stability wise i would suggest you test with orthos for stability at optimum speed (which means your cores are running at 100%), like wise do take note of the temperature as well.<br>  <br>  *Note Read up before doing anything<br>  <br>  Do note as well that once you start overclocking:<br>  <br>  - Warranty for hardware compnents (ram, cpu and etc...) will be void<br>  - You might fry the cpu if not done properly<br>  - Throw into some scenarios where the computer will not even boot  up (Reset the CMOS, that why i strongly emphasize on getting a good motherboard, recovery will be easy as well.<br>  <br>  Here are a few sites i would recommend:

T17pbHVJaa	None should work.<br>  <br>  School's are legally bound by the federal Children's Internet Protection Act to block proxies and the like.<br>  <br>  Schools have to take this seriously to get certain technology funding.<br>  <br>  All the proxies you try should be blocked by your school. That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.<br>  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist. <br>  <br>  You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.<br>  <br>  Your risking your computer rights/detention/suspension by trying to bypass their security.

In the case of anime music, it is a bit harder to find. If no one is seeding them on Limewire, my only other suggestion is to look around the web using some search engines to see if there are sites who have anime song downloads. Other than that, there really is no way to find them on Limewire unless someone began seeding them. Hope this helps.

zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES.

KgtI19bgaa	Your site is the money maker; how much traffic you have, the kind of volume you bring in, your targeted audiance and of course how much you bid per key. I would stay doing what you're doing and invest in better SEO/SEM, also check out Yahoo and Facebook's Adwords like programs, they can also help you generate cash. And affiliate programs like the ones on hostrocket.com or tshirthell.com, where one sale through your site makes you $10 - $25 bucks; but SEO is what you should really be working on; the better the SEO, the more hits you get, the more % you get for a higher ROI.

go18cJRHaa	LimeWire is a free peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) client for the Java platform, which uses the Gnutella network to locate files as well as share files. It also has limited BitTorrent support. A freeware version as well as a purchasable "enhanced" version is available.<br>  Written in the Java programming language, LimeWire is able to run on any computer with Java Virtual Machine installed. Installers are provided for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Support for Mac OS 9 and other previous versions was dropped with the release of LimeWire 4.0.10. From version 4.8 onwards, LimeWire works as a UPnP Internet Gateway Device controller in that it can automatically set up packet-forwarding rules with UPnP-capable routers.<br>  <br>  LimeWire offers the sharing of its library through the Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP). As such when LimeWire is running and configured to allow it, any files shared will be detectable on the local network by DAAP-enabled devices (e.g., iTunes, Zune).<br>  <br>  FrostWire is a peer-to-peer file sharing program for the Gnutella and BitTorrent protocols. FrostWire is written in Java, and is a fork of LimeWire, another popular Gnutella client. Released under the GNU General Public License, FrostWire is free software.<br>  As with LimeWire, FrostWire is in Java, and therefore is capable of supporting multiple platforms. While LimeWire is available in both free and paid versions, FrostWire is released only as a free version which comes bundled with the Ask.com toolbar. The FrostWire program includes many of the functionalities of LimeWire's free version, as well as a few features of LimeWire Pro's payment based upgrades. FrostWire also provides a chatroom, which is absent in LimeWire. However, LimeWire includes an instant messenger using the Jabber protocol and allows the user to share with individual friends in the messenger which is a feature not found in FrostWire. FrostWire's interface used to be nearly identical to that of LimeWire's. With the release of LimeWire 5.0, LimeWire created a brand new interface while FrostWire continues to use the old interface found in older versions of LimeWire. FrostWire's skin may be changed to a variety of different colors which is no longer an option in LimeWire 5.0.<br>  Cathy

Simply add under the last break of your switch: <br>  default: <br>  break;<br>  <br>  This is to guard against any random response (i.e. ones that aren't 1-4).<br>  <br>  <br>  Words of advice: group all your variable declarations at the beginning of the program, also, you don't need an extra variable for answer.  You could simply do a cout << num1 + num2 << endl; after reading in both numbers.  This will save you some code and time.|`|wPRx1nCeaa	It looks like you forgot your default: statement. It is just like your case x: statements, except it is what the switch statement defaults to when the variable you are switching on (In your case, response) does not match any of the case x: statements.

zorYTX59aa	I see questions similar to yours every few days on Y!A now,<br>  so I recently did a whole lot of Googling, searching, reading <br>  -- going through dozens of discussion forums and websites <br>  only to realize that there are no definitive answers out there. <br>  <br>  The only semblance of a "part solution" that kind of worked<br>  for a few people would require you to either:<br>  1 -- fool around with your "registry" (which I would be totally <br>  deadset against because that could really screw things up); <br>  2 -- download some utilities (which I would be just as much<br>  against, because that kind of stuff is what probably created<br>  your problem in the first place).<br>  <br>  Thus, my first piece of advice to you: shutdown then reboot.<br>  If that doesn't work, this is what I advise many other people<br>  when YouTube is slow, stuck or weird:....Clear your "cache"<br>  of all your "Temporary Internet Files". As you are doing that,<br>  you should also clear your "History" and your "Cookies", in <br>  order to make your computer "fresh". My famous triple-cure<br>  seemingly resolves many people's YouTube problems, thus<br>  why not yours. Please reboot after doing this:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  If that doesn't do the trick, here are some other suggestions:<br>  <br>  ? If you've got "Google Web Accelerator" or anything similar,<br>  uninstall it immediately. GWA destroys YouTube.<br>  <br>  ? Long videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave" to play<br>  properly. Shockwave includes Flash, but not vice versa.<br>  <br>  ? The most recent versions of Flash are regularly frustrating<br>  a lot of YouTubers. Most updates are typically good for only <br>  1 thing: potential software conflicts. If you are using 1 of the <br>  5 different versions of version 10 (yes -- there actually are 5), <br>  you may want to consider this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  ? Avoid crappy add-ons, downloaders and converters. There <br>  are a lot of answerers on Yahoo! who are actually disguised <br>  salespeople. If anyone's solution is for you to buy/install/get<br>  something, please keep in mind that their answers probably<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and that the products<br>  they're peddling will no doubt worsen your problem. Besides, <br>  what kind of boffo and self-serving answer is that? "Although <br>  you cannot listen to YouTube videos or watch them properly,<br>  buy our downloader". [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  ? Who knows why it works, but sometimes things go better<br>  when you change the web URL from "www.youtube.com" to<br>  just "youtube.com", or you could even try "ca.youtube.com".<br>  <br>  ? A few people found success by closing their web browser, <br>  then restarting it. A couple others simply rebooted, and one <br>  person said that everything magically started working again<br>  just like that on the following day -- with no effort on his part.<br>  Thus your problem might just be a temporary glitch.<br>  <br>  If you're able to find the "cause" and the "cure", I would very<br>  much appreciate it if you could click on my avatar and write <br>  to me, so that I may include it in my future Yahoo!

edPeEGzmaa	Welcome to the copyright debacle. There really is no right answer.<br>  <br>  Technically it's their product though, and they don't take kindly to us taking their music and putting it out for all of the world to hear for free. I mean people can easily rip the audio from a youtube video and then have the song, but still.<br>  <br>  I have no sympathy for these damned companies. They are reporting record earnings and yet keep crying bloody murder to the governments about losing their profits to copyright infringement. I certainly hope that the current lawsuits between torrent sites like The Pirate Bay and Isohunt with the CRIA and the MPAA are resolved in favour of the torrent sites, because it's getting to be ridiculous to hear them drone on and refuse to adapt to changing times.|`|GxSxTc2haa	It doesn't matter if you paid for it, that does not include the right to post it online where the whole world could download it for free.<br>  That's what the copyright infringement is.
awuj2fGIaa	Absolutely<br>  <br>  You share out the files the exact same way that you would on a local network.<br>  <br>  Then to access the files you just use the hamachi ip address in place of the LAN ip address to access the shares on the other computer.<br>  <br>  Hamachi also has this feature built right into it once the folders are shared out. You just right-click the computer in Hamachi and then click on browse and it will show you all of the shares on that computer. You will need the "Block vulnerable windows services" box unchecked in the security section of the preferences for this to work as well.<br>  <br>  There is much more info on this in the Hamachi forums.

Then maybe start by signing up with a free host, e.g. Netfirms Basic or the popular 110mb host.  You can also create a web site easily with Weebly, Synthasite, Jimdo, and Webepags. Visit their web sites to review them, and sign in if you want.<br>  <br>  Then perhaps download and use a free template from one of many templates web sites, then upload your site to your free host (use a free FTP program to upload your site - e.g. Core FPT Lite. Then you can optimize for search engines, directories, etc, if you want. <br>  <br>  I use the free host, Netfirms, but their are restrictions, e.g. bandwidth, file upload size, file space size, no direct links to flash sites, etc, but has worked ok for me. Many free hosts require their company name to be added to your URL as a sub domain, (e.g. my site.their sub domain.com) and you may have to add one of their ads (link or banner) to your site. <br>  <br>  You could start with a blog as well, e.g. try the Google’s blogger or the advanced Wordpress (which you can add plugins for enhancement), or use the simple Google Page Creator (soon to be changed to Google Sites - You need a Gmail account) - easy to set up for a beginner. <br>  <br>  There are free (and easy) web site building tools, such as Weebly (Using drag and drop), Snap Pages (Good for sharing photos), and Edicy Pages (Various templates/themes similar to Blogger and Wordpress).<br>  <br>  Later on though, it might pay to learn html/JavaScript/PHP etc, which allows more flexibility to design and modify your web site. Then maybe upgrade to a paid host and domain, which will possibly yield more features (scripting features, higher bandwidth, increased storage space, email accounts, etc) and more ownership of your site...

It's up to a seller if they run an individual auction as private -- buyers don't get to do that.<br>  <br>  You can (1) Turn off all your feedback, though this is likely to scare away buyers even more, or (2) wait 90 days for auction details to expire, or (3) ask the seller to not leave you feedback, though that would be really weird.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that buyers can also look up completed items to see what things have been selling for, and they're likely to figure out your bulk price even if you don't have feedback for it.<br>  <br>  You're most likely looking at waiting 90 days for the details to expire or else you're just going to have to be somewhat transparent for any buyer who goes poking around.

It should automatically find the drivers and install them, if not you'll need to have them handy but it would be very abnormal for it not to detect and install the drivers with Windows XP.<br>  <br>  The system may tell you that it has installed new hardware and that your new hardware won't work until the system is restarted.  If so, restart the computer.<br>  <br>  Go back to Device Manager and right click the AC'97 audio device and select 'Update Driver...' to be sure you have the latest driver installed.  Again, if it wants to restart the system then do so.<br>  <br>  You probably already knew how to get to Device Manager, at least I assume that's where you got the info you posted.  If so, my apologies but it's best to assume on here that a person knows nothing and go from there.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you're smart enough to already have checked the jacks and to be sure you have the speakers turned on, right?  The green jack is the default for the speakers and some speakers have a button or a knob that you have to use to turn on the power to them.  PC speakers need power, btw, as the computer doesn't amplify the signal enough to drive the speakers like a stereo does.  There should be an LED that comes on when the speakers are powered.<br>  <br>  If none of the rest of this worked then the last thing to try is to plug in a headphone, of any kind, into the green jack and see if you get sound from it.  If so, then it's the speakers not the audio hardware.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't fix it, you'll need to buy a new sound card because the one that's in the system is fried.  Unfortunately there is no further trouble shooting to be done in a case like this.  You can get a decent sound card for your Intellistation at any big box or online store for $30+.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy computing.<br>  <br>  ===============================<br>  Original Post above this line^<br>  <br>  U P D A T E D     I N F O R M A T I O N:<br>  <br>  Actually, that's good news as it looks like you've found the problem.

The sound output assignment is controlled by software so maybe this is a mixed up. Try speakers in all of the sockets one at a time.<br>  <br>  Also try downloading the "soundman" application from the motherboard or sound card vendor. This adds mixer capabilities beyond those in WIndows and you might get better control that way.

IGJGUfjNaa	There may be several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how. <br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.   <br>  <br>  4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.<br>  Check your drivers. <br>  <br>  5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/fix-computer-freezes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...</a>|`|E3N016csaa	Vista isn't the problem.<br>   It's the software that controls everything<br>  all the hardware and all the other software you use.|`|ULw1777caa	Vista isn't the problem, the crap you have on the PC probably is.

If you can try using VGA mode instead of safe mode when booting up that might get you in again then you can try looking at the video card driver.  I take it you already know about pressing F8 to get the boot options by the fact you've already mentioned safe mode.  Safe mode uses minimal drivers which may skip the keyboard/USB drivers you need to operate the keyboard. VGA mode might be worth a try.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  conflicts. I have never strayed away from 9.47 -- and lots of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?

See also < <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Cite" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Cit...</a> >.<br>  <br>  If you really need to be specific, there is a useful tool on the Wikimedia Toolserver that will let you identify the most significant authors of a given article.

It stayed that way until last month, when Nvidia introduced the GTX 285 and 295, retaking the high-end crown.<br>  <br>  But for $100, the Radeon 4830 is better than anything Nvidia offers- it crushes the 9600GT.  You need to spend $25 more for a 9800GT to beat it.  The Radeon 4850 is still the best card at the $150 mark. When you get to Nvidia's GTX 260 Core 216 vs ATI's Radeon 4870, that's where things get competitive again.  It's hard to believe, but Nvidia's years of dominance were completely erased almost overnight.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-4870,1964.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/rade...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3341&p=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.legitreviews.com/article/794/1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.legitreviews.com/article/794/...</a><br>  <a href="http://xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/msi-9800gt.html" rel="nofollow">http://xbitlabs.com/articles/video/displ...</a><br>  <br>  For DirectX 10, Windows XP isn't in the game- you've gotta go Vista.

Vista with 3GB works fine for me...  <br>  <br>  On  the CPU front, Core 2 Duos still offer better value for gaming than quads.  With $160 I can get either a 3.0Ghz E8400 or 2.4Ghz Q6600 and it's no contest- the dual-core owns the quad.

zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  conflicts. I have never strayed away from 9.47 -- and lots of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end.

T17pbHVJaa	Very few around, and for any real ones, there will be 1000 scam sites.<br>  <br>  I never have found or heard of a legitimate one that will earn you any real money, and I have looked. The ones that are real, make you do so much for so little, (sometimes pennies an hour) that it is not worth it.<br>  <br>  Best way to make some spare money at home is to sell things on Ebay. I know it can be hard to get products to sell, but it can be done. I have sold over 400 items over 5 years, yeah, not exactly a lot really, but it's just pocket money for a little work at the weekend.<br>  <br>  But I know of a stay at home mom that goes to Ross and stores like that, buys clothes that are on sale only and sells them on ebay for good money. She has made over 4000 sales in 2 years. She brings in hundreds a month.<br>  <br>  Edit: Your name suggests you are under 18. You have to be 18 or over to sell on Ebay, you need a credit card, paypal account etc.|`|DyL3zC7caa	I made my first money in the first week after visiting here www.2bcu.info/moneycentral|`|kCOnaOtpaa	there are numerous ways to earn money online, but most of them require certain registration fee. if you wish to earn without investing anything, then i will suggest you PTC sites, where u get money to click advertisements.................. i myself is earning respectable side income from them. all you have to do is register and start clicking advertisements right away.<br>  You might earn slow in the beginning but once u buy refferal packs from the money u've earned, it multiplies your earnings and speeds it up. and moreover its a totally genuine and scamfree way of earning.<br>  <br>  PATIENCE IS THE KEY<br>   <br>  you can visit the recommended sites by following the link below:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/eco.soldier/refer.html?1235331050659" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/eco.soldier/ref...</a>|`|FEgJH3Ajaa	Find this out at Better Business Bureau,for the best sites before you buy anything first.
2SSA9e9Naa	The key here is the long, either long in disk access time or long time to process a transaction. In that case you want to get transactions executing in parallel to optimize the use of the database. The time for each transaction will be variable and thus you will get some back faster than others and can't display/process results sooner. If you do them all in serial order (non-concurrent) then you cannot handle things in parallel and overall execution time will increase.<br>  <br>  If all of the data is in memory (which means fast retrieval) or the transactions are small then they will normally execute very fast. If you overlap them (concurrent) the time save will be very negligible (small). If you did them serial it presumabley will not take that much longer.|`|QFprxYLCaa	If data is in memory, like say when using Hibernate, or when transactions are short and fast, concurrency won't gain a lot of performance for you since most transactions will finish before another needs to be executed.  However, if your transactions are slow, process heavy, or you have issues with slow disks or network latency, you can process more transactions in a given period of time if you are able to run more than one concurrently.  This is because, generally, the transactions won't finish before the next one is queued up waiting to run.

I have better success in that, especially Belkin.<br>  <br>  2) Don't expect speed of a hard wire connection as the fastest wireless offer is 54mbps for wireless G vs 100mbps in cable. <br>  <br>  3) There are a few wireless standard and the most common ones are b, g and n.  No one really use b now and g was quite popular and most cost efficient for the time being.  n is the fastest but will probably cost you more and make sure your router supports that as well.|`|ebuxHnScaa	They work just fine. They are as safe as cable if you properly secure your wireless network.<br>  <br>  They are not nearly as fast as a wired connection. They are probably much faster than your Internet connection, so you won't notice it when using the Internet. But you will notice it if you transfer files between your computer, have a file server, stream video, and so on.|`|qNRzgEX5aa	USB wireless works fairly well.  Reception is limited but in an averaged size house it won't be a problem.  Only thing to worry about with wireless is making sure you secure your network.  Of course you can't ever be 100% secure but make sure to encrypt your network and mask the SSID (network name).  <br>  <br>  If you want to go a different route, one that I use, check out D-Link's Power Line network.  You plug your router into the adapter, which plugs into your wall outlet, and every other outlet in your house becomes a network hub.  I like this much better than dealing with wireless as it is more secure and faster. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=533&sec=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=533&s...</a>
