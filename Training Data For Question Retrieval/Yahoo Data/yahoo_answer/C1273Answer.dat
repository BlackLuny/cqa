K6QlFoo0aa	Hi sweetkisses_520,<br>  <br>  When I answered another question of your you picked it for a best answer and wrote for a comment:<br>  <br>  <br>  "Asker's Comment:<br>      OMG! thank you!! This made more sense to me than the book!<br>      :) Can I email you?"<br>  <br>  That was for the question: "differentiate T(w)=cot^3(3w+1)."<br>  <br>  Since you don't accept email I really couldn't answer you. :).  If you mean by Yahoo Answers mail then you have to accept their email.  If you mean by regular email, you do realize that I will then know your email address, but nobody else will.  I'm a harmless 62 year-old so you really don't have to worry about that.  If that's the way that you want to communicate, my address is:<br>  <br>  gerryrains@yahoo.com<br>  --------------------------------------<br>  <br>  Now to this question:<br>  <br>  1)  The expression inside of the parentheses is easier to work with if you write it like this:<br>  <br>  (z^2 + z^(-2))<br>  <br>  Since d(z^n)/dz = n*z^(n-1):<br>  <br>  Equation (1)  d(z^2)/dz = 2z, but then I know you knew that.<br>  <br>  Equation (2)  d(z^(-2))/dz = (-2) * (z^(-2-1)) (since n = -2) and this is equal to:<br>  <br>  (-2)*(z^(-3))<br>  <br>  So the derivative of what is inside of the parentheses (also called the "internal derivative" which is just a conclusion drawn from the chain rule is the sum of those:<br>  <br>  Result (1):  [2z + ((-2) * (z^(-3))]<br>  <br>  Let me explain that in terms of the chain rule itself:<br>  <br>  Let u = (z^2 + z^(-2))<br>  <br>  and let y = g(z).<br>  <br>  Then the chain rule states that dy/dz = dy/du * du/dz<br>  <br>  and du/dz is exactly what I have called "the inner derivative" - that is:<br>  <br>  [2z + ((-2) * (z^(-3))]   which is Result (1)<br>  <br>  Is that okay?  Email me if it isn't but I think that it should be - of course I have to be able reply to your questions :D<br>  <br>  So, since du/dz =[2z + ((-2) * (z^(-3))]<br>  <br>  and y = (u)^6, so dy/du = 6*(u^5) <br>  <br>  g'(z) dy/dz = dy/du * du/dx = 6 * [(z^2 + z^(-2))^5] * [2z + ((-2) * (z^(-3))]<br>  <br>  or if you don't want the negative exponents in the answer it =<br>  <br>  6 * [(z^2 + (1 / (z^2)))^5] * [2z + ((-2) * (1 / (z^3))]<br>  <br>  Once you understand that what I call "the inner derivative" which is what I learned and taught  is nothing but the chain rule in what I and my classes always thought was an easier way of solving problems, then you can use it but if your teacher wants you to do so, write out the chain rule for him/her.<br>  .|`|B8IPlF8Baa	You made one or two typos.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, the derivative of f^6 is 6f^5 times the derivative of f.

R8rux0cJaa	You should be able to look this up in a table.  Start by finding a z-score in the table in the back of the book that has a shaded area of .63 under the left side of the curve.  This should be in the center part of the table.  In my book I get z = .33 as having an area of .6293, which is pretty close to the area we want of .63.  This is great, but it isn't the value we want which is x, not z.  So we are going to use the following formula to turn this z-score into an x value.<br>  <br>  z = (x - μ)/σ<br>  In your case the mean is μ = 41, the standard deviation is σ = 6, and we have just computed z = .33.  Solve for x.<br>  .33 = (x - 41)/6<br>  x = 42.98<br>  <br>  So, x0 = 42.98 is the value such that P(x<x0) = .63<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!

buLqy1b3aa	a)  The equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel is given by the following equation:<br>  <br>  1/Req = 1/R1 + 1/R2<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Req = R1*R2/(R1+R2)<br>  <br>  The equivalent resistance of two resistors in series is just their sum (which makes sense because resistance in a branch should increase when you add another "obstacle" in series).<br>  <br>  With this knowledge, the parellel 4.4 ohm resitors can be combined to form a 2.2 ohm resistor.  The series 1 ohm resistors can be combined to form a 2 ohm resistor.  This gives us parellel 2.2 ohm and 2 ohm resistors which can be combined to form a 1.05 ohm resistor.  This 1.05 ohm resistor is in series with 3 ohms and 2 ohms, giving us 6.05 ohms.  Finally, the 6.05 ohm resistor is in parallel with the 6 ohm resistor, which gives us a final equivalent resistance of 3.01 ohms.<br>  <br>  b)  Firstly, we know the voltage across two parallel branches is the same.  This is because the electric potential between two points is independent of the path that current needs to take to complete the circuit.<br>  <br>  Knowing that parallel branches have the same voltage, we know that the potential difference between each of the 4.4 ohm resistors are the same, and that this is also the same as the potential difference across our 1.05 ohm resistor from part (a).  <br>  <br>  So the problem reduces to finding the potential difference across the 1.05 ohm resistor.  This resistor is in series with 2 ohms and 3 ohms, and we know the potential difference across all these series resistors is 15V.  To find the potential difference across the 1.05 ohm resistor alone, you can use the voltage division equation:<br>  <br>  Vr1 = Vtot*R1/(Rtot).<br>  <br>  This equation is based on the fact that the voltage drop across each resistor is proportional to the resistance of each resistor.<br>  <br>  In this case,<br>  <br>  V = 15V * 1.05ohms/(1.05 ohms + 3ohms + 2ohms)<br>  V = 2.6V<br>  <br>  c)  The current through a single branch is the same throughout.  This is because charges repel each other, and a traffic jam in one part results in a traffic jam everywhere else in the branch.  Similarly, an increased flow in one part results in an increased flow everywhere else in the branch.<br>  <br>  Therefore you can calculate the current through the 3 ohm resistor simply by finding the current in the overall branch.  In this case, the overall voltage is 15V, and the overall resistance is 6.05 ohms.  Therefore the current is 2.48A

zFsTSrOcaa	Long-range forecasts are a lot more accurate than they used to be.  Satellites can track the development and movement of weather systems, and supercomputers can run more accurate modeling programs to predict where those systems will go and what they'll do.  There are numerous computer models available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and the meteorologist takes each of these into account when making an official forecast.

It happens far more often naturally then synthetically. Take bacteria for instance. Each dividing bacterial cell are exact clones of each other. Also, certain types of insects can go through parthenogenesis - again, when an insect gives birth to another without a mate - this is also cloning. Creatures going through asexual reproduction clone on a regular basis, for they must. Also, do not disregard the other kingdoms - fungi sporophytes use cloning often, as a basis for reproduction.<br>  <br>  Hybrids also occur in nature - albeit more rarely then cloning. Take, for example, the pizzly - a (silly, in my opinion) name given to the naturally occurring grizzly and polar bear hybrids.<br>  <br>  Trait selection obviously happens; for instance, sexual selection. A famous example is the peacock. A female one will actively seek a trait; in this case, the largest, brightest tail fans in the males.<br>  <br>  Which leaves the answer to be gene flow between kingdoms. And this makes sense - has anyone ever seen a animal/plant hybrid? a bacteria that looks much like a dog? a mushroom that grows flowers? Genes do not flow between kingdoms - it is entirely between creatures belonging to the same kingdom.<br>  <br>  the answer is therefore b) gene flow between kingdoms.<br>  <br>  p.s. Emucompboy...you are correct to say that is transformation, but its not gene flow between kingdoms. There is only one kingdom involved, and the bacteria is taking advantage of the environment. Not gene flow, more like gene modification or enhancement.|`|1ipx3YAIaa	HUH?? i dont talk smart person.....sorry. If i would guess i would think B

The sugar used in ribonucleic acid (RNA) nucleotides is called ribose, while the sugar used in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nucleotides is called deoxyribose.<br>  <br>  2. Instead of the nucleotide thymine (T) in DNA, the nucleotide uracil (U) is used in RNA.<br>  <br>  The other differences as well -- RNA can travel out of the nucleus to cause protein synthesis and RNA is much smaller than DNA since it just a copy of one portion of the immense DNA molecule. Also, DNA is highly stable, while RNA is degraded shortly after its creation. Finally, RNA exists as a single strand, while DNA exists as a double-stranded helix.|`|Z0UdL0LSaa	From the versuswiki article:<br>  The main difference between these two molecules is the sugar; DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains deoxyribose; RNA (Ribonucleic acid) contains ribose.

Monsanto (once a poison factory) is one of the biggest corporations in the world that is responsible for altering the food we eat. When something has been genetically modified it means that for example its DNA was changed so that the plant will become more resistant to pesticides. This is great for farmers but for those eating those plants it is dangerous. For example, some farmers have gotten into the habit of injecting their cows with hormones so that the cows will get bigger and they can produce more milk or more meat. Again this is very useful to the farmers but for the children drinking that milk which is now induced with extra hormones they are at risk of growing too fast, becoming hairier, girls breasts are larger etc. The terrible thing is that scientists have been altering our food for generations and they wonder why everyone is getting cancer. Our parents and grandparents have been guinea pigs to see the effects of genetically modifying food.
e7KoyoWsaa	it's a debatable question, but the short answer is that because there is less daylight in the winter, it's better to start your day earlier.  That way instead of the sun coming up at 6, it comes up at 7, so that it goes down at 5 instead of 4.  More people are awake at 4-5pm than at 6-7am, so it would be best to tack on the hour of sunlight at the end of the day.|`|wqchA8B7aa	One of the many effects of this adjustment is that it shifts the start of the day (according to clock time) closer to sunrise. Modern DST was first proposed in 1907 by the English builder William Willett. Through vigorous campaigning, by 1908 Willett had managed to gain the support of an MP, Robert Pearce, who made several unsuccessful attempts to get it passed into law. A young Winston Churchill promoted it for a time,[1] and the idea was examined again by a parliamentary select committee in 1909 but again nothing was done. The outbreak of the First World War made the issue more important primarily because of the need to save coal. Germany had already introduced the scheme when the bill was finally passed in Britain on 17 May 1916 and the clocks were advanced by an hour on the following Sunday, 21 May, enacted as a wartime production-boosting device under the Defense of the Realm Act. It was subsequently adopted in many other countries. Many countries have used it since then; details vary by location and change occasionally.<br>  <br>  The practice is controversial.[2] Adding daylight to afternoons benefits retailing, sports, and other activities that exploit sunlight after working hours,[3] but causes problems for farming, entertainment and other occupations tied to the sun.[4][5] Traffic fatalities are reduced when there is extra afternoon daylight;[6] its effect on health and crime is less clear. Although an early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, formerly a primary use of electricity,[7] modern heating and cooling usage patterns greatly differ, and research about how DST currently affects energy use is limited and often contradictory.[8]<br>  <br>  DST's occasional clock shifts present other challenges. They complicate timekeeping and can disrupt meetings, travel, billing, recordkeeping, medical devices, and heavy equipment.[9] Many computer-based systems can adjust their clocks automatically, but this can be limited and error-prone, particularly when DST rules change.[10]|`|4JnQqHBQaa	Like everyone else said... it's to give us more light to do the things we need to outside. I found this neat article to explain a lot!<br>  <br>  Daylight saving time is most often associated with the oh-so-sweet extra hour of sleep in fall and the not-so-nice loss of an hour in spring, but some of the original reasons for resetting our clocks twice a year including saving energy and having more daylight hours for retailers, sporting events and other activities that benefit from a longer day.<br>  <br>  As far back as the 1700s, people recognized the potential to save energy by jumping clocks ahead one hour in the summer — Benjamin Franklin even wrote about it — although the idea was not put into practice until the 20th century.<br>  <br>  During both World Wars, the United States and Great Britain began observing daylight saving time.<br>  <br>  After the war, U.S. states were free to choose whether to observe daylight saving time and the calendar start dates of the time change. The result was time confusion for travelers and newscasters. In 1966, Congress enacted the Uniform Time Act, which stated that if any state observed daylight saving, it had to follow a uniform protocol, beginning and ending on the same dates throughout the country.<br>  <br>  Starting in 2007, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 lengthened daylight saving time by four weeks, starting it three weeks earlier in spring and ending it one week later in fall. Daylight saving now begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday of November.<br>  <br>  Formerly it began on the first Sunday of April and ended on the last Sunday of October, so that extra week gives trick-or-treaters a precious extra hour of candy-gathering before sunset.|`|3xhceOoFaa	Its some age old tradition dating wayyy back so that farmers will have more time to tend to their crops when the growing season comes.

We change our clocks during the summer months to move an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening. Countries have different change dates. Glide your cursor over the map to see how changing the clocks affects different latitudes.<br>  <br>  A poll conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation indicated that Americans liked Daylight Saving Time because "there is more light in the evenings / can do more in the evenings." A 1976 survey of 2.7 million citizens in New South Wales, Australia, found 68% liked daylight saving. Indeed, some say that the primary reason that Daylight Saving Time is a part of many societies is simply because people like to enjoy long summer evenings, and that reasons such as energy conservation are merely rationalizations.<br>  <br>  According to some sources, DST saves energy. Studies done by the U.S. Department of Transportation in 1975 showed that Daylight Saving Time trims the entire country's electricity usage by a small but significant amount, about one percent each day, because less electricity is used for lighting and appliances. Similarly, in New Zealand, power companies have found that power usage decreases 3.5 percent when daylight saving starts. In the first week, peak evening consumption commonly drops around five percent.<br>  <br>  The rationale behind the 1975 study of DST-related energy savings was that energy use and the demand for electricity for lighting homes is directly related to the times when people go to bed at night and rise in the morning. In the average home, 25 percent of electricity was used for lighting and small appliances, such as TVs and stereos. A good percentage of energy consumed by lighting and appliances occurred in the evening when families were home. By moving the clock ahead one hour, the amount of electricity consumed each day decreased<br>  <br>  <br>  In the summer, people who rose before the sun rises used more energy in the morning than if DST were not in effect. However, although 70 percent of Americans rose before 7:00 a.m., this waste of energy from having less sunlight in the morning was more than offset by the savings of energy that results from more sunlight in the evening.<br>  <br>  In the winter, the afternoon Daylight Saving Time advantage is offset for many people and businesses by the morning's need for more lighting. In spring and fall, the advantage is generally less than one hour. So, the rationale was that Daylight Saving Time saves energy for lighting in all seasons of the year, but it saves least during the four darkest months of winter (November, December, January, and February), when the afternoon advantage is offset by the need for lighting because of late sunrise.<br>  <br>  In addition, less electricity was thought to be used because people are home fewer hours during the "longer" days of spring and summer. Most people plan outdoor activities in the extra daylight hours. When people are not at home, they don't turn on the appliances and lights.<br>  <br>  Although a 1976 report by the National Bureau of Standards disputed the 1975 U.S. Department of Transportation study, and found that DST-related energy savings were insignificant, the DOT study continued to influence decisions about Daylight Saving Time.<br>  <br>  The argument in favor of saving energy swayed Indiana, where until 2005, only about 16 percent of counties observed Daylight Saving Time. Based on the DOT study, advocates of Indiana DST estimated that the state’s residents would save over $7 million in electricity costs each year. Now that Indiana has made the switch, however, researchers have found the opposite to be the case. Scientists from the University of California, Santa Barbara, compared energy usage over the course of three years in Indiana counties that switched from year-round Standard Time to DST. They found that Indianans actually spent $8.6 million more each year because of Daylight Saving Time, and increased emissions came with a social cost of between $1.6 million and $5.3 million per year. Commentators have theorized that the energy jump is due to the increased prevalence of home air conditioning over the past 40 years, in that more daylight toward the end of a summer’s day means that people are more likely to use their air conditioners when they come home from work.<br>  <br>  However, the Indiana research findings don’t necessarily apply elsewhere. In cooler climates, for example, energy savings may well occur.<br>  <br>  In addition, some argue that there is a public health benefit to Daylight Saving Time, as it decreases traffic accidents. Several studies in the U.S. and Great Britain have found that the DST daylight shift reduces net traffic accidents and fatalities by close to one percent. An increase in accidents in the dark mornings is more than offset by the evening decrease in accidents.<br>  <br>  However, recent research indicates that pedestrian fatalities from cars soar at 6:|`|EdOzbvAVaa	here something i found out<br>      * It saves energy. When we're awake, we're more likely to have our TVs, VCRs, and lights on (among other home appliances).

If you know the binomial probability mass function (or more to the point, know what that means) you can argue the number of functioning engines is a binomial random variable (specifically with parameters 4 and 0.8).  You should be able to add up the probability x=2, x=3 and x=4, all of which would lead to a functioning aircraft.<br>  <br>  If you have not seen the term "probability mass function" before, an alternative way to think about the problem is to consider ways in which the aircraft might fail.  If three engines fail, or all four fail, the aircraft fails.  This means either all four engines fail, or one of the four engines (labeled A through D) is still working. Let's calculate the probability of each possible event:<br>  <br>  What is the probability all four engines fail (hint, probability of failure is 0.2)?  Recall you can get the probability of a series of independent events by multiplying their individual probabilities.  <br>  <br>  What is the probability that engine A is the only working engine (that is, engines B, C, and D all fail)?  Engine A working has a 0.8 probability, while engine B failing has a 0.2 probability (as with engines C and D).  <br>  <br>  Now what is the probability of engine A, C and D failing, but engine B working?  (You should have done this calculation before.)  How about if engine C works and the other three fail?  Same question for engine D?<br>  <br>  You should now have five probabilities (four of which are the same).  Each is a mutually exclusive event which would lead to the failure of the aircraft.  Recall you can add the probabilities of mutually exclusive events.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

If you know how much iodine you had at the start, and you measure the amount you have left at the end, you can measure how much ascorbic acid you had.<br>  <br>  Usually, iodine is titrated with sodium thiosulfate. The ratio between thiosulfate and iodine is 2:1. As long as you know the molarity of the thiosulfate, you can calculate the amount of iodine left over. Subtract that from the original amount, then you will get the amount of iodine that reacted with ascorbic acid.

Generally, to become a zoo veterinarian in a larger zoo, a veterinarian would require additional specialized training such as completing a one year post-veterinary-school internship program in zoo medicine, or a 2-3 year residency in zoo medicine, or both. Some veterinarians gain the required experience in other ways such as becoming a contract veterinarian for a smaller zoo or working in an exotic animal private practice or starting as a volunteer veterinarian in a zoo, but that is less common.<br>  <br>  Zoo veterinarian Mitch Willette offers the following advice. "Stay in high school and get excellent grades; take all the college level prep courses you can. Volunteer at your local veterinary clinic. Obtain a 4 year college degree and get excellent grades; the degree doesn't really matter although most are biology/wildlife/agriculture oriented. Volunteer at a veterinary clinic, or better yet, get paid for it! Be admitted to a veterinary school and get excellent grades; the college doesn't really matter although some veterinary colleges have more extensive exotic programs than others. Most veterinary colleges have strict residency requirements so you may have to plan ahead. While in veterinary school, try to volunteer in positions dealing with exotics such as a local zoo, rehabilitation facility, a private practice that sees a lot of exotics, etc. Be prepared to give up your summers and vacation time for this effort. Today, most prospective zoo veterinarians perform an internship and/or residency in zoological medicine. These programs are few in number and highly competitive, hence the remarks about good grades and lots of volunteer work with exotics.<br>  <br>  Join the American Association of Zoological Veterinarians as a student member. If you are not fortunate enough to obtain an internship or residency, other avenues into zoological medicine include - specializing in nutrition, reproduction, or pathology; doing part-time contract work for a local zoo; and volunteering at a zoo. Other exotic careers include exotic private practice, wildlife rehabilitation, wildlife medicine, and probably the newest field - conservation medicine. HAVE DEDICATION and PATIENCE, most of these positions take a long time and a little bit of luck to secure."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/kids/jobs_animal_health.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandiegozoo.org/kids/jobs_ani...</a><br>  How to get a job like this<br>  Get excellent grades in high school and college and take animal-related courses like biology and zoology. Gain experience by volunteering or working in animal-related jobs or research programs. Go into an organized program for animal science. Registered veterinary technicians take a two-year course to earn a license. Veterinary training requires many years of college, internship, and residency (a two- or three-year position to give you experience in a specialty). The competition is stiff.

Because, for example, D is equal to A + C, D cannot equal 1, because A or C would have to be less than or equal to 1.  Also, no product or its factors can equal 1.<br>  So, 1 cannot be D, Y, B, E, P, Q, F, L, H, G, I, K, W, M, U, V, T, N, X, O, or Z.<br>  Therefore, 1 must be A, C, J, R, or S.<br>  <br>  Also, none of the terms of the sum can be 26.<br>  So 26 cannot be A, C, S, I, V, H, Z, G, R, O, J, M, or U.<br>  <br>  Starting with #11, U must be a square number and not equal to 1 (U cannot equal M, so neither can equal 1).  Possible values for U are 4, 9, 16, and 25.  Hence, possible values for M are 2, 3, 4, and 5.<br>  <br>  Now, compare #4 and #14.  Since Q = O*Z = E*P, Q cannot be a prime number or a square.  Also, the factors can't be 1, so Q must have two sets of non-one factors.  Possible values for Q, then, are 12, 18, 20, and 24.<br>  <br>  Next, any product cannot be a prime number, so Q, H, U, N, and W cannot be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.<br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  List what you know:<br>  1 must be A, C, J, R, or S.<br>  26 cannot be I, V, H, Z, G, O, M, or U (or any of the letters for 1).<br>  U must be 4, 9, 16, or 25.<br>  M must be 2, 3, 4, or 5.<br>  Q must be 12, 18, 20, or 24.<br>  H, N, and W cannot be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.<br>  <br>  That's not a whole lot to go on, but you get the idea.  Look for more clues and add to the list until the problem is solvable.<br>  <br>  Use etopro's clues as well.  And use a chart to keep track.<br>  <br>  ------------------------------------<br>  Here are some more clues.<br>  <br>  (etopro's clues)<br>  E, P, G, V, T, X, O, and Z are less than or equal to 13.<br>  P is less than or equal to 6 (either 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).<br>  <br>  Since U is at least 4, S is at most 22 (U+S = W).<br>  <br>  Since Q must be even, O and/or Z is even, and E and/or P is even.<br>  <br>  If Q = 12, E, P, O, and Z are either 2, 3, 4, or 6.<br>  If Q = 18, E, P, O and Z are either 2, 3, 6, or 9.<br>  If Q = 20, E, P, O, and Z are either 2, 4, 5, or 10.<br>  If Q = 24, E, P, O, and Z are either 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12.<br>  Therefore, E, P, O, and Z are either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, or 12.<br>  <br>  I, V, H, Z cannot be 1 and cannot be 26 and aren't be added to a possible 1 value, so, they cannot be 25.<br>  <br>  B is at most 26, so I and V are at most 25.<br>  I at most is 25, so R and O are at most 24.<br>  O is at most 12, so R is at most 13.<br>  <br>  M is at least 2, so J is at most 24.<br>  <br>  N, W, Q, and H cannot be square numbers (4, 9, 16, or 25).<br>  <br>  D, Y, B, F, L, I, K, and W must be greater than 2 (at least 3).<br>  <br>  H is at least 6, and Z is at least 2, so F is at least 8.<br>  I is at least 3, and V is at least 2, so B is at least 5.<br>  <br>  If W = 6, then either X or P would equal either 2 or 3.  U would have to equal 4, and S would have to equal 2.  Since S would equal X or P, W cannot be equal to 6.<br>  If W = 8, then either X or P would equal 2 or 4.  U would have to equal 4, and S would have to equal 4.  Since S would equal U, W cannot be equal to 8.<br>  Therefore, W is at least 10.|`|f9d6d3d5e93067c8d6765550648fd589aa	I'll give you a short summary of how I'd start. There is no short summary of a solution.<br>  <br>  First, I, V, E, P, G, M, V, T, X, O, and Z appear as multipliers. None of them can equal 1, because none of them are products in their multiplication equations. Also, none of them can be as large as 14, because their products must be 26 or smaller.<br>  <br>  Next, there are equations that multiply P by E, G, and X. Even if E, G, and X are as small as 2, 3, and 4, P cannot be greater than 6, because all of its products must be 26 or smaller. Similarly, even if P is as small as 2, E, G, and X must all be smaller than 14.<br>  <br>  Next, because M x M = U, M must be 2, 3, 4, or 5, and U must be 4, 9, 16, or 25.<br>  <br>  That's the general idea. To narrow things down graphically, make a 26 x 26 table with the letters down one side and the numbers 1 through 26 along the top. Mark out the squares that represent impossible values. After, oh, a day or so you should have it.

mxqAOxYRaa	The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from matter after the absorption of energy from electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays or visible light. The emitted electrons can be referred to as photoelectrons in this context. The effect is also termed the Hertz Effect due to its discovery by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, although the term has generally fallen out of use.<br>  <br>  Photoelectric effect takes place with photons with energies of about a few eV. If the photon has sufficiently high energy, Compton scattering(~keV) or Pair production(~MeV) may take place.<br>  <br>  Study of the photoelectric effect led to important steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced the formation of the concept of wave–particle duality.<br>  <br>  The term may also refer to the photoconductive effect (also known as photoconductivity or photoresistivitity), the photovoltaic effect, or the photoelectrochemical effect.

bxigm5Dbaa	The average velocity is the change in distance divided by the change in time.  The change in distance is s(1.50) - s(1.00) = 3.5 (1.5)^2 - 3.5(1)^2 = 7.875.  The change in time is 1.50 - 1.00 = .50.  Then the average velocity is 7.875/.5 =  15.75 ft/sec|`|sXAAClMvaa	Remember d=rt, we find distance by plugging in the elapsed time in the interval [1.00,1.50]. So s(.5)=3.5(.5)^2=.875. Now plug in .5 for t and solve for r (rate or velocity). 3.5(.5)^2/.5=1.75. The average velocity is 1.75 seconds.
QNyztmU3aa	There is a version of Stokes' theorem which works for manifolds with corners, and it works more or less how you would expect.  A dirty way to make this work is to approximate the corners locally by smooth surfaces and then take a limit; you might be able to work out the details yourself with the appropriate machinery.  The "right" way is to build an intrinsic theory of piecewise linear surfaces and then prove a version of Stokes' theorem in that setting; either way it all works out.

For the sake of Answers I'm saying fake, but someone else might see it differently.|`|DkszJ67yaa	The "orbs"  in the picture look like dust.  The reason I say this is because they have blochy edges and the color fades as it reaches the edges.  A true orb (merely being a collected ball of natural energy)  is a perfect circle, producing it's own light, so it would be solid in color.  As for the misty image on the staircase, I see nothing in the surroundings to cause a reflection of that size.  If in fact the picture is genuine, and not altered as you say.  you may have caught something paranormal.  It is hard to say what, or who it is from a single picture.|`|8CSmgakwaa	I find it very unusual I dont know how the one on the stairs could be such a large reflection as everyone is saying.|`|SOvItNDHaa	OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Its Big Foot's alien friends trying to eat your soul!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So one polar molecules positive side is going to be attracted to another polar molecules negative end<br>  <br>  Hydrogen bonding: a special class of strong dipole-dipole interactions<br>    hydrogen bonding is a result of a large difference in electronegatiivity between hydrogen and Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Fluorine. This means that the hydrogen has a fairly large partial positive charge <br>    Basically, because N,F, and O have large electronegativity, they pull the electron closer to them, and away from the hydrogen, causing the hydrogen to have a partially positive charge|`|d8PIt3EHaa	hydrogen bonding forces are the strongest of the three forces. they only occur between hydrogen and nitrogen, oxygen and flourine. This is because of their large elecrtonegativity differences. just remember (NOF)<br>  <br>  diplole-dipole forces are usually the most common force you will see. they occur between any 2 atoms really. it is the attraction between the atoms in the molecule because of charge differences. for example MgSO4<br>  <br>  london dispersion forces are the same as dipole dipole but are much weaker and only occur between diatomic molecules. (any element with itself). examples of this are O2, H2|`|9AwGOnysaa	Okay so first of all you need to know that those are intermolecular bonds (bonds in between molecules).<br>  <br>  London Forces: (also called London dispersion) is present in all intermolecular bonds. It's the weakest one.<br>  <br>  Dipole-dipole: Only found in polar molecules, where one is slightly negative and one is slightly positive. Stronger than LF.<br>  <br>  Hydrogen bond: When hydrogen is connected to either Nitrogen, Oxygen, or Fluorine (NOF). The H HAS to be connected to NOF.<br>  Strongest type of intermolecular bond.<br>  <br>  Oh and, the stronger the intermolecular bond is, the higher boiling point it has.
RkTsYKvBaa	Your tree will make flowers every year.  It doesn't matter whether they are pollinated or not, and a lack of pollinators will not hurt the tree in any way.  The flowers won't die prematurely, in fact, since they aren't pollinated, they may last a little longer on the tree than they otherwise would.  There's nothing to worry about, just enjoy your nice tree :)|`|g9ymvTfQaa	No, it won't do damage to the tree or flower. Even if it has no fruit it is still a flowering plant. If there's no pollinators, the pollen won't go to the stigma and then the egg cells won't go to the ovary then the flower won't grow. According to my science teacher, people can pollinate too by touching their anthers then touch the stigma. If you don't pollinate your plant, it won't grow flowers. Any questions?|`|kDZjuKUaaa	It's actually spelled crabapple LOL<br>  <br>  The flowers will just fall off and grow again next year in hopes of being pollinated again. It won't damage the tree.. All reproducing organisms are like this. If they don't get fertilized one time, they will naturally keep trying the next year/month/etc in order to increase their progeny.<br>  <br>  It's a basic theme of evolution, where you're considered "more fit" if you can produce more children/baby trees than the next person/tree. =)

Also not likely a result from ionization and without affecting a charged particle (proton or electron) it wouldn't be forming an ion.<br>  <br>  D.  In the case of Xenon it would require adding neutrons.  Aside from being very highly unlikely it also suffers from not being an ion.<br>  <br>  B.  Ions carry charge, + or -.

Also, note you posted in Biology... asking a similar question in the physics (or chemistry) section could also give you more answers.|`|5LQVhoSSaa	It would be B because it is a LOT easier to steal an electron than it is to steal a neutron and it gives the same effect : D|`|BrarMA1Haa	I would say B.  The xenon ions are what are accelerated for thrust.  Xenon is a noble gas, meaning its shells are filled with electrons and has no tendency to acquire or give up electrons by bonding to other elements.  So to make it an ion, the most likely method is to force an electron out of it.<br>  <br>  The attached link states that the gas atoms are made into ions by electron bombardment.

They also keep track of the cutting edge of theoretical physics and engineering. There are several physicists working on alternative solutions to the equations Einstein was working with when he came up with E =MC squared. Two of the possible solutions do involve possible FTL. A little humility is indicated on this subject as we clearly don't know all there is to know about it. The school systems dumb down the subject because it is a difficult one that most people don't actually need to know the precise mathematics involved in it.|`|W2suykEtaa	just plain practical physics limits the ability to approach the speed of light and completely forbids you traveling AT the speed of light.<br>  <br>  faster, tho... who knows|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Once upon a time they believed travelling faster than the speed of sound was impossible.|`|ldl8y9i2aa	As mass is accelerated it increases in mass.<br>  <br>  At 86% the speed of light an astronaut will have TWICE the mass he had at rest.<br>  The mass increases faster as you approach the velocity of light.<br>  <br>  At 99.999% the speed of light your astronaut would be so massive<br>  that no rocket could propel him any faster.<br>  <br>  The amount of energy needed approaches an infinite amount.<br>  <br>  The new LHC particle accelerator in Europe runs into this problem<br>  just accelerating electrons and protons, let alone astronauts.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  <br>  Some said you could travel faster than the speed of light,<br>  just not at the speed of light.<br>  Question: how does one 'jump' over the speed of light to get to travel faster than the speed of light?|`|AA10222010	Nothing with any mass can move *through* space at the speed of light.

Humans have mass, so this is impossible.<br>  <br>  Interestingly though, since light moves slower in a medium than in a vacuum, it is possible for an object to travel faster than the speed of light in that medium. Though humans could never do this (we've only done it with elementary particles) it produces the sonic boom-equivalent for light called Cherenkov Radiation.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just had to add something to debunk the people here who think something could travel faster than the speed of light, just not at the speed of light. The equation for the Lorentz factor is one over the square root of one minus the velocity squared divided by the speed of light squared.

Is this the correct molecule you meant to ask about?<br>  <br>  <br>  This is a catalytic hydrogenation problem, where the catalyst is platinum and there are hydrogens attached to the platinum surface.  I'll try to draw a picture with lines.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is the surface of the platinum with the hydrogens attached:<br>  <br>  <br>            H      H                             H         H<br>             |       |                                |          |<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  (Ok you're going to see the text box does not align my vertical lines with each H -   One vertical line to each H represents its bond to the platinum surface.

Unfortunately you can't draw dashed or wedged lines like are used in chemistry in this text box provided by yahoo.|`|7GFBEefraa	If you draw the structure out, you are going to be breaking the double bond. Hydrogenation is a syn addition, so you can put the two methyl groups on the ring on wedge, remove the double bond, and put two hydrogens (one on each carbon) on dashes. <br>  <br>  To draw the other product, just flip the wedge and dashes (put methyl groups on dashes, hydrogen on wedges).

kDZjuKUaaa	There are university courses that take weeks and weeks to cover it in vague detail LOL<br>  <br>  But yea, the processes are trancription and translation..<br>  <br>  Transcription makes the original protein strands straighten out, and split the double-helix figures temporarily. This makes a transcription loop, and it is bidirectional (occurs at opposite ends of the loop when they unwind). A leading and lagging strand will occur at each end, because you can only synthesize 5' to 3'. (5' and 3' are just the carbons being numbered based on the ribose/deoxyribose molecule, and bases are added in that direction). Many molecules are needed for this process. after most of it is done, the strands made are proofreaded. These strands are essentially RNA and are the base for more DNA to be made from.. Kinda like a cake tin, and DNA is the cake.<br>  <br>  RNA is transported out (and in humans, exons and introns are there, and introns are spliced off by splicosomes). Once the RNA is out of the nucleus and into the nucleus, tRNA are giant molecules that contain 2 main docking ends. One of the ends will attach to the RNA and the other will attach to one of the 20 amino acids. When RNA is made, it has bases that make it up, like A,T,C,G. Well, 3 groups of those make up a "codon" and 1 codon will encode for one of the 20 amino acids. UAG i believe is the start codon that allows the tRNA to begin translation..

Alternatively, sow in seed trays and transplant when large enough. They can be cut quite young for use in salads or left to mature for use in stir fries. If the plant ‘bolts’ do not discard the flowering head as these can also be eaten. Ideal for the polytunnel, enjoying a hot and wet climate they are usually ready in five to six weeks.

That there have been many many universes before ours. They all had their own big bangs and expanded, the expansion was eventually overcome by gravity and collapsed into itself and created the next big bang erasing any evidence of the previous universe's existence. But ours (since they seem to think the expansion is accelerating) had something different happen where the initial expansion was able to overcome gravity and here we are. So maybe the universe is eternal, but in the past it has had a "cycle of life" where it was created and destroyed just to be created again that it followed, but now it will expand into eternity and in universe terms - ultimately freeze to death. Maybe in all the other universes each iteration expanded a little bit further than the last until ours where it finally reached that critical point where expansion won. Maybe in the last universe there was an alien species that by the time of the collapse of that universe had evolved their technology to a point where they were aware of and maybe even able to try to stop the destruction of their universe and in that effort somehow did something that caused the next universe's (ours) to reach that critical expansion point.<br>  <br>  These are all just thoughts and theories that are impossible to prove or gather evidence about but I think the idea is interesting none the less.

VJwjkxBJaa	Basically, the slower the plane is moving when it touches down, the safer the landing.  Also, the quicker you get the plane off the ground, the better.  <br>  <br>  That said, if you have a 20 mph wind at your back, you will be going 20 mph faster than you need to be when you are trying to land (speed in aircraft is measured referencing the air it is moving through, not the speed with reference to the ground).  If you have a 20 mph headwind, you will be going 20 mph slower, hence, a slower speed at touchdown.  This also results in using LESS of the runway, which is obviously important - you don't want to run out!  In both instances (tailwind and headwind) the aircraft's instruments would indicate the SAME airspeed, even though the aircraft's speed over the ground would be 40 mph different in each case.<br>  <br>  Taking off is the same principle.  If there is 20 mph tailwind, it takes you longer to take off and you have to use more runway than if you went into the wind.|`|FT4mVJMzaa	Aircraft take off and land at specific airspeeds. Taking off and landing into the wind reduces the groundspeed associate with that airspeed, and therefore it takes up less runway.|`|AA10199093	It is preferred that they take off and land into the wind, but they don't always.  The big reason is control of the aircraft.  Wind coming from behind, especially behind at an angle can be dangerous depending on the strength of the wind and the size of the aircraft. It's much easier to keep the aircraft straight, on the centerline of the runway if the wind is hitting the plane head on.  Lift isn't so much of a factor.  For short field landings a strong wind hitting the nose does make life easier and would make life much more difficult if not impossible if you had wind from behind.|`|5yATLJi3aa	Planes land and takeoff based on indicated airspeed. When the wind blows into the plane the indicated airspeed will be the ground speed plus the wind speed. If a plane takes off with the wind the ground speed will be the wind speed plus the indicated air speed. <br>  <br>  If a plane faces into a 30 knot wind while sitting still the indicated air speed will be 30 knots and the ground speed zero.|`|Ii0Kd6hdaa	The faster the air moves over the wings of an aircraft the stronger the lift force that is being applied to the wings. Flying into the wind increases the speed of the air moving over the wings. Flying with the wind would decrease the speed.|`|5VwzPXKaaa	It helps them get lift and helps them slow the plane|`|fkqPs9QRaa	im guessing for lift.|`|T8DThYKHaa	Takeoff velocity is the velocity of the wind passing over the wings.<br>  If the wind is blowing at 40kph the plane can get airborne at a ground speed that is 40kph less than it's takeoff speed, if it takes off into the wind.<br>  <br>  If it took off with the wind, it would have to have a ground speed 80kph faster, wasting fuel to achieve this extra speed.<br>  <br>  When landing it is the same thing. The plane has to land with it's airspeed a bit above stalling speed. It's ground speed is decreased by the velocity of the wind, saving some wear on the tires and brakes. <br>  <br>  If you watch seagulls on a windy day, you can sometimes see them get airborne just by opening their wings while facing into the wind. This is because the wind is faster than their takeoff speed.|`|fbf7a0218ad796311e2571268fcb04d4aa	Taking off into the wind helps with lift, while landing into the wind acts as resistance and helps slow the plane down.|`|mHYgWgtPaa	The wind hitting against the wings is what makes the plane able to lift off or go down.

kDZjuKUaaa	Most molecular biology and genetics courses will offer dna analysis. If you're going into any science degree, they'll REQUIRE you to take at least an introductory course in protein synthesis and molecular bio. If you're very interested, you could find a professor who's currently doing research on these topics and apply as a lab assitant to gain offhand knowledge. I wouldn't really say there criminal justice is the related field.. I suggest the course ethics, as it ties in very much to the science side. It's listed as a philosophy course in my university though. I'm sure 99% of universities will have such courses like "molecular biology." genetics is more on the side of finding probabilities of traits that appear.

The sky is clear and transparent - just like it is at night when the moon and stars shine through it without being altered in their color.  The blue sky color is an optical illusion - just like a rainbow.<br>  <br>  A rainbow isn't a real object although the colors you see are real.  You can make a rainbow with a garden hose and a sprinkler head and the Sun.  The rainbow looks like it is real and really there but when you turn the water off the rainbow goes away.  <br>  <br>  The reason the rainbow has colors is because the light going into a rain drop is refracted and then is totally internally reflected and then is refracted as it exits the drop.  The angle of refraction of the light is color dependent.  That produces the rainbow's colors.  Notice that the rainbow always appears opposite the Sun.  The Sun has to be at your back.<br>  <br>  In a similar way the blue color of the sky is created all over the sky and it looks like there is a real blue sky but it goes away when the sun goes down.  The object we call the blue sky is an optical illusion.<br>  <br>  The blue sky color is created when sunlight shines through the Earth's atmosphere during the day.  The atmosphere is mostly composed of oxygen, argon and nitrogen gasses.  As sunlight shines through the atmospheric gasses some of the light is scattered in all directions by the very molecules of the gasses.  This scattering process, called Raleigh Scattering is very wavelength dependent.  Blue light is scattered in all directions about 10 times as much as red light is scattered and so we see mostly blue light coming from the direction of the sky.<br>  <br>  The blue sky is light scattered from the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere… The rainbow is created by refraction of light within a rain drop.|`|TRrTunqvaa	something about reflections of light.|`|5O7dYY0taa	Water bends light so that blue light is sent out while all other wavelengths of visible light are reflected back into space or at wide angles so that you wouldn't see them unless it was dawn or dusk.<br>  <br>  or i could say that god made it that way so that we wouldn't be staring into the blackness of universe.<br>  <br>  or i could say that it's like that i have no idea.|`|B3s2HsKQaa	I would say that the water reflects the sunlight giving the sky a bluish color..|`|RvPUn4aDaa	I would say that i have no idea.

TXyFtQ9uaa	Magnetism is utilized in contactors or relay switches, with contactor switches you have main feed supply and then a control circuit component that when energized will close the contactor switch energizing the other part of the contactor switch which would normally be off, thus completing the circuit in question. These switches are usually used in lighting circuits accommodating a large area or being the required component of three phase motor circuits which are part of AHU/ACUor FCU supply fans or pumps in an industrial environment. Also inside miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) their is a bi-metallic strip that detects an imbalance between the live and neutral conductors in a circuit, should a fault occur in the circuit in question, the bi-metallic strip would bend in such a way causing the fault current to pass to earth and thus breaking the circuit, in effect minimizing the risk of life loss due to electrical shock. in general the principles of a magnet used in circuits is either to close or open (NO or NC normally open or normally closed) a circuit without user intervention there by effecting safety measures without injury or possible loss of life.

In common usage, the heat of vaporization is used in place of the more precise term the enthalpy of vaporization, which has the symbol ()Hvap. The enthalpy of vaporization is the heat of vaporization for vaporizing one mole of the substance under three specific conditions: (1) the pressure remains constant, (2) the only possible work that occurs is expansion against the atmosphere (so-called P()V work) and (3) the temperature remains constant during the process. A heat of vaporization for a substance is only valid for conversion of the pure liquid to the pure gaseous state of the substance.<br>  <br>  Your specific question...<br>  Hv is measured as J/mol or kJ/mo<br>  <br>  For you,<br>  Hv = kJ/mol<br>  <br>  Hv of substance =28.4/3.21<br>  Hv = 8.847 kJ/mol<br>  <br>  <br>  More from Wikipedia...<br>  <br>  Enthalpy of vaporization<br>  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>   <br>   <br>  Temperature-dependency of the heats of vaporization for Water, Methanol, Benzene, and Acetone<br>  The enthalpy of vaporization, (symbol ΔvH), also known as the heat of vaporization or heat of evaporation, is the energy required to transform a given quantity of a substance into a gas.<br>  It is often measured at the normal boiling point of a substance; although tabulated values are usually corrected to 298 K, the correction is often smaller than the uncertainty in the measured value.<br>  The heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent, though a constant heat of vaporization can only be assumed for small temperature ranges and below Tr<<1.0. The heat of vaporization diminishes with increasing temperature and it vanishes completely at the critical temperature (Tr=1) because above the critical temperature the liquid and vapor phases don't coexist anymore.<br>  ?  <br>   Units<br>  Values are usually quoted in J/mol or kJ/mol (molar heat of vaporization), although kJ/kg or J/g (specific heat of vaporization), and older units like kcal/mol, cal/g and Btu/lb are sometimes still used, among others.<br>  <br>  Latent heat<br>  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>  In thermochemistry, latent heat is the amount of energy in the form of heat released or absorbed by a chemical substance during a change of state (i.e. solid, liquid, or gas), or a phase transition.[1][2]<br>  The term was introduced around 1750 by Joseph Black as derived from the Latin latere, to lie hidden. The term has now been replaced by "enthalpy of transformation".<br>  Two latent heats (or enthalpies) are typically described: latent heat of fusion (melting), and latent heat of vaporization (boiling). The names describe the direction of heat flow from one phase to the next: solid → liquid → gas.<br>  The change is endothermic, i.e. the system absorbs energy, when the change is from solid to liquid to gas. It is exothermic (the process releases energy) when it is in the opposite direction. For example, in the atmosphere, when a molecule of water evaporates from the surface of any body of water, energy is transported by the water molecule into a lower temperature air parcel that contains more water vapor than its surroundings. Because energy is needed to overcome the molecular forces of attraction between water particles, the process of transition from a parcel of water to a parcel of vapor requires the input of energy causing a drop in temperature in its surroundings. If the water vapor condenses back to a liquid or solid phase onto a surface, the latent energy absorbed during evaporation is released as sensible heat onto the surface. The large value of the enthalpy of condensation of water vapor is the reason that steam is a far more effective heating medium than boiling water, and is more hazardous.<br>  ? <br>  Latent heat equation<br>  The equation for latent heat is:<br>   <br>  where:<br>  Q is the amount of energy released or absorbed during the change of phase of the substance (in joules),<br>  m is the mass of the substance,<br>  L is the specific latent heat for a particular substance (J kg-1). <br>  In other words, specific latent heat is found when energy is divided by mass.|`|ZRS6V6Rcaa	damn.... how did i pass chem

This gives you 3.6.  the reason is because m is in the numerator, and you must divide by 1000, to keep km in the numerator.  If you divide by 1000 m, you cancel meters and are left with km.  the same goes for seconds to hours: there are 3600 seconds in an hour, so you must multiply because seconds are in the denominator.  Multiply by 3600 seconds, and you get 3600 hours, divide by 1000, and you get 3.6.|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	You don't. a km is (very) roughly .625 miles, or 5/8. Fractions are easier for ballpark estimates.To convert km to miles, move the decimal one place to the right to multiply by 10, divide by 2 to get the product of 5, and then divide the answer by 8. You can do this easily in your head, and it's handy for distances outside the US. Convert miles to km by multiplying by 8/5. If you doubt me, check your speedometer, which has a speed ring for each measure.|`|T8DThYKHaa	There are 1,000 meters in a km so you have to divide meters by 1,000 to convert to km.<br>  <br>  There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour so to convert from seconds to hours you have to multiply by 3,600 (60 * 60)<br>  combine these figures to convert m/s to k/h <br>  3,600/1,000 = 3.6<br>  <br>  We don't normally speak of accelerating in km/h^2 but if we did, the conversion factor is: <br>   3.6 * 3.6 = 12.96 because s^2 = s * s and hr^2 = hr * hr

Its called the Harvest Moon because its large enough and bright enough to give people in the past enough light to continue harvesting into the night.<br>  The large size is due to the warm air at the surface of the Earth magnifying the moon a bit.  Also, since there is a shorter-than-usual time between moonrise and darkness the moon appears larger (this is an optical illusion).|`|J3TGyOnDaa	The moon is usually larger at moon rise and moon-set because of refraction, and you have visual objects on the horizon to compare it to and improve your perspective. Constellations also seem to be bigger near the horizon for the same reasons. The moon is visually largest when it is at perigee (closest to the Earth, but nowhere near touching the Earth) around the full moon. This happened in November last year, the moon was full and at perigee. This doesn't happen at any particular time of year, although there is the 18.26 saros cycle. (I may/probably) have the decimal numbers wrong.) Astronomy magazine's monthly sky calendar gives the dates when the moon is at apogee and perigee  and the dates and times for new, first quarter, full, and third (last) quarter phases of the moon.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	The "horizon effect" is actually an optical illusion.   Next full moon try actually measuring the full moon with a ruler at arm's length on the horizon, and again 3 or 4 hours later.  You'll note that despite what you think you see (and just about everybody sees this effect) that the size of the full moon is actually the same overhead vs when it is on the horizon. <br>  <br>  The only actual change in the moon's size occurs when comparing a perigee full moon to an apogee full moon.|`|M6AySVxOaa	The apparent size of the moon depends upon distance and phase. So it would have to be at its closest perigee and a full moon. It usually appears biggest when it is lowest in the sky (atmospheric refraction).|`|FT4mVJMzaa	The atmosphere NEVER "magnifies" the moon. The large appearance of the Moon on the horizon is an illusion, and it is actually slightly larger when it is directly overhead.|`|y8yLVQJnaa	The reason it looks larger at the horizon is not because the atmosphere or anything magnifies it.  This has been falsified over and over again, using the Scientific Method.<br>  <br>  In Science, deductive logic doesn't let you prove, but only disprove, and you "fail to disprove" rather than prove.  I took a Psychology class, also once looked up a peer-review article on this exact subject (but can't find the reference to it), and below included some links.  It seems to be a visual "illusion".  Your eyes bring in light.  Your brain puts it together and uses cues to perceive distance and size.  Basically if it is an visual illusion, it would use the least amount of assumptions to explain the most amount of facts.

Q0ixYdQnaa	Contrary to popular belief the sky is not blue because water is blue the water is blue because the sky is. The sky is blue because are our atmosphere scatters blue light from the sun while leaving red light to pass through. what we see as a blue sky is that scattering of the suns light. This is also why the moon is red right before an eclipse because our atmosphere prevents the blue light from getting to the moon and therefore only red light is reaching it.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	The sky is not blue, it only appears blue.  The sky is clear and transparent - just like it is at night when the moon and stars shine through it without being altered in their color.  The blue sky color is an optical illusion - just like a rainbow.<br>  <br>  A rainbow isn't a real object although the colors you see are real.  You can make a rainbow with a garden hose and a sprinkler head and the Sun.  The rainbow looks like it is real and really there but when you turn the water off the rainbow goes away.  <br>  <br>  The reason the rainbow has colors is because the light going into a rain drop is refracted and then is totally internally reflected and then is refracted as it exits the drop.  The angle of refraction of the light is color dependent.  That produces the rainbow's colors.  Notice that the rainbow always appears opposite the Sun.  The Sun has to be at your back.<br>  <br>  In a similar way the blue color of the sky is created all over the sky and it looks like there is a real blue sky but it goes away when the sun goes down.  The object we call the blue sky is an optical illusion.<br>  <br>  The blue sky color is created when sunlight shines through the Earth's atmosphere during the day.  The atmosphere is mostly composed of oxygen, argon and nitrogen gasses.  As sunlight shines through the atmospheric gasses some of the light is scattered in all directions by the very molecules of the gasses.  This scattering process, called Raleigh Scattering is very wavelength dependent.  Blue light is scattered in all directions about 10 times as much as red light is scattered and so we see mostly blue light coming from the direction of the sky.<br>  <br>  The blue sky is light scattered from the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere… The rainbow is created by refraction of light within a rain drop.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Why don't people us the Search on Yahoo to read the dozens of answers to these simple questions?????????????????????????????<br>  Is it because people are lazy?<br>  Do smart people use all the tools they can to learn?<br>  :/|`|bHPB2CuUaa	Are you sure you don't see a rainbow?

dIS08i1oaa	Both a diamond and a CZ will scratch glass, so this is not a good way to tell the difference.<br>  <br>  The most obvious and common sense way to spot a fake diamond is to look for tiny flaws, first with your naked eye and then with a magnifying glass or jewelers loupe.  If you can't see any flaws under magnification and the color is clean white, then you are either looking at a VS Clarity, D-F Color diamond, or a fake.  <br>  <br>  Consider this:  how much did you pay for your little rock?  The wholesale cost of a 1 Carat, VS Clarity, D-F Color diamond is about $7500.  No dealer would sell a diamond for much less than his cost.<br>  <br>  When you say it is not perfect, do you mean that you can see internal flaws?  These would be either black spots, cloudy areas, or translucent feathers.  Any of these would indicate that it is a genuine diamond with a low Clarity rating of I2 or I3.<br>  <br>  Also, you can try dropping your stone into a glass of water.  If it is a genuine diamond it will become nearly invisible.  If it is a CZ, it will look nearly the same as it does when it is outside of the water.<br>  <br>  I have added a link below where you can read more about how to spot a fake diamond.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	If you can scratch the surface of the stone its not diamond.

While real diamonds acquire scratches, chips, dents, and the like over time, other materials show the wear and tear much faster. If you see visible scars, be on alert. And if you, a non-gemologist, can see visible scars on a natural diamond, expect the diamond to be priced much lower than Rapaport value. <br>  <br>  -Place the loose diamond over newsprint and attempt to read through the diamond. If you can read through the diamond, it is either a fake or a poor cut (“low cut”). <br>  <br>  -Breathe on the diamond just as you would to fog a window. If the fog remains more than two seconds, it’s likely a fake. Repeat the fog test on the bottom of the diamond; some fakes are crafted with a diamond surface and synthetic underside. <br>  <br>  -Place the stone under ultraviolet light, and watch for blue fluorescence. Medium to strong blue indicates a real diamond. If there is no blue fluorescence, either the diamond is of excellent quality or it is a fake. <br>  <br>  -Look inside the setting for any stamps. “CZ” indicates the stone is cubic zirconia. A stamp such as “10 K,” “14K,” “18K,” “585,” “750,” “900,” “950,” “PT,” and “Plat” describe a setting’s gold or platinum status. High-quality diamonds will be set in high-quality settings, not something gold plated or made of an inferior metal. Of course, a dishonest jeweler could set a fake stone in a high-quality setting—or could even stamp the setting to make it appear of higher quality than it really is. <br>  <br>  -Look with magnification at the stone. Facets should be joined with sharp lines, not rolls. The girdle should have facets; it should not be waxy or slick. Most diamonds have natural internal flaws; most fakes do not. <br>  <br>  -Moissanite, a popular diamond substitute, sparkles greatly in outdoor light but appears dull with incandescent lighting. <br>  <br>  -To keep costs low, fake gems are often machine cut, rather than hand crafted. Machine cut moissanite will not display the “hearts and arrows” seen in hand-cut, natural diamonds. <br>  <br>  -A jeweler may offer to prove a diamond is real by using his diamond tester. Be cautious, as moissanite will frequently fool a diamond tester—and a smart jeweler knows this. So, at least don't ask for the store that sold you the diamond to test it--go somewhere else.<br>  <br>  -When a cubic zirconia stone is submerged in water, the gemstone virtually disappears; a natural diamond is easily visible. The water enhances the two stones’ differences in light refraction. <br>  <br>  -Weigh the stone on a scale you trust. Cubic zirconia weighs approximately 55% more than diamond.<br>  <br>  I hope those tips help.|`|PwZZJh1taa	find a jeweler you can trust

It is located in the Cabusilan Mountain range separating the west coast of Luzon from the central plains, and is 42 km (26 mi) west of the dormant and more prominent Mount Arayat[2], occasionally mistaken for Pinatubo. Ancestral Pinatubo was a stratovolcano made of andesite and dacite. Before 1991, the mountain was inconspicuous and heavily eroded. It was covered in dense forest which supported a population of several thousand indigenous people, the Aeta, who had fled to the mountains from the lowlands during the protracted Spanish conquest of the Philippines which first commenced in 1565.<br>  <br>  The volcano's ultra-Plinian eruption in June 1991 produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century (after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta) and the largest eruption in living memory.[3] The colossal 1991 eruption had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6, and came some 450–500 years after the volcano's last known eruptive activity (estimated as VEI 5, the level of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens), and some 1000 years after previous VEI 6 eruptive activity.[4] Successful predictions of the onset of the climactic eruption led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding areas, saving many lives, but surrounding areas were severely damaged by pyroclastic flows, ash deposits, and later by lahars caused by rainwater remobilizing earlier volcanic deposits: thousands of houses and other buildings were destroyed.[3]<br>  <br>  The effects of the eruption were felt worldwide. It ejected roughly 10 billion metric tonnes (10 cubic kilometres) of magma, and 20 million tons of SO2, bringing vast quantities of minerals and metals to the surface environment. It injected large amounts of aerosols into the stratosphere—more than any eruption since that of Krakatoa in 1883. Over the following months, the aerosols formed a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. Global temperatures dropped by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F), and ozone depletion temporarily increased substantially.<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Overview of the Mount Pinatubo area <br>  2 Cultural history <br>  3 Geological history <br>  3.1 Ancestral Pinatubo <br>  3.2 Modern Pinatubo <br>  4 1991 awakening <br>  4.1 Evacuation <br>  4.2 Eruptions build to a climax <br>  4.3 The climactic eruption <br>  4.4 Aftermath <br>  4.5 Local economic and social effects <br>  4.6 Global environmental effects <br>  4.7 The area since 1991 <br>  5 Religion <br>  6 Trekking the volcano <br>  7 Related images <br>  8 See also <br>  9 Notes <br>  10 References <br>  11 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Overview of the Mount Pinatubo area<br>   <br>  Location of Mt. Pinatubo, showing area over which ash from the 1991 eruption fellPinatubo is part of a chain of volcanoes which lie along the western edge of the island of Luzon. They are subduction volcanoes, formed by the Philippine Plate sliding under the Eurasian Plate along the Manila Trench to the west. Mount Pinatubo lies on a destructive plate boundary.<br>  <br>  The volcano is located 89 km (55 miles) northwest of Manila, 14 km (9 miles) west of the former Clark Air Base, and 37 km (23 mi) north of the former U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay [5]. Clark Air Base's residential areas and petroleum storage facilities were in much closer proximity to the volcano than the airfield complex and neighboring Angeles City.<br>  <br>  Several important river systems have their sources on Pinatubo, with the major rivers being the Bucao, Santo Tomas, Maloma, Tanguay and Kileng rivers. Before the eruption, these river systems were important ecosystems, but the eruption filled many valleys with deep pyroclastic deposits. Since 1991, the rivers have been clogged with sediment, and the valleys have seen frequent lahars. Studies show that the river systems will take many years yet to recover from the 1991 eruption.<br>  <br>  About 500,000 people continue to live within 40 km of the mountain, with population centres including the 150,000 in Angeles City, and 20,000 at Clark Freeport Zone.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cultural history<br>  The word 'pinatubo' means 'to have made grow' in Tagalog and Sambal, which may suggest a knowledge of its previous eruption in about AD 1500, although there is no oral tradition among local people of earlier large eruptions. Pinatubo might instead mean a fertile place where crops can be made to grow. An indigenous group of people, the Aetas (also spelled as Ayta), had lived on the slopes of the volcano and in surrounding areas for several centuries, having fled the lowlands to escape persecution by the Spanish. They were a hunter-gatherer people who were extremely successful in surviving in the dense jungles of the area. These people also grew some staple crops such as wheat, barley and rice.<br>  <br>  Before the catastrophic eruption of 1991, Pinatubo was an inconspicuous volcano, unknown to most people in the surrounding areas. Its summit was 1,745 m (5,725 ft) above sea level, but only about 600 m above nearby plains, and about 200 m higher than surrounding peaks, which largely obscured it from view. Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, a native of Zambales, named his C-47 presidential plane "Mt. Pinatubo". The plane crashed in 1957, killing the President and 24 others onboard.[6]<br>  <br>  In total, about 30,000 people lived on the flanks of the volcano in barangays (villages) and other small settlements. The dense jungle covering most of the mountain and surrounding peaks supported the hunter-gathering Aeta, while on the surrounding flatter areas, the abundant rainfall (almost 4 m annually) provided by the monsoon climate and the fertile volcanic soils provided excellent conditions for agriculture, and many people grew rice and other staple foods.<br>  <br>  <br>  Geological history<br>  Although there seems to be no local knowledge of the previous large eruptions in the Pinatubo area, several Aeta residents reported in 1991 that their elders recalled small explosions in the past. Pinatubo was a known geothermal area before the 1991 eruption, and small steam explosions are quite common in such areas. It was only after volcanic activity began in 1991 that geologists studied the eruptive history of the region in any detail. Eruptions at the site can be divided into two major eras.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ancestral Pinatubo<br>   <br>  Pinatubo before the major eruption of 1991Much of the rugged land surrounding the present volcano consists of remnants of 'ancestral' Pinatubo. This volcano was located roughly in the same place as the present mountain, and activity seems to have begun about 1.1 million years ago. Ancestral Pinatubo may have reached a height of up to 2,300 m (7,550 ft) above sea level, based on profile fitting to the remaining lower slopes.<br>  <br>  Several mountains near modern Pinatubo are old satellite vents of ancestral Pinatubo, formed from volcanic plugs and lava domes. Some nearby peaks are also remnants of ancestral Pinatubo, formed from erosion-resistant parts of the old mountain slopes left behind when the less resistant parts were eroded away by weathering.<br>  <br>  The eruptive activity of ancestral Pinatubo was much less explosive than modern Pinatubo, and probably ended about 45,000 years ago. After a long period of dormancy, modern Pinatubo was born in eruptions beginning about 35,000 years ago.<br>  <br>  <br>  Modern Pinatubo<br>  The birth of modern Pinatubo occurred in the most explosive eruption in its history, which deposited pyroclastic flow material up to 100 meters thick on all sides of the mountain. The total volume of material erupted may have been up to 25 cubic kilometers (6 mile3), and the removal of this amount of material from the underlying magma chamber led to the formation of a large caldera.<br>  <br>  Earlier large eruptions occurred 17,000, 9000, 6000–5000 and 3900–2300 years ago. Each of these eruptions seems to have been very large, ejecting more than 10 km3 of material and covering large parts of the surrounding areas with pyroclastic flow deposits. Scientists estimate that the most recent eruption before 1991 happened about 450 years ago, and after that, the volcano lay dormant. Its slopes became completely covered in dense rainforest, and eroded into gullies and ravines.[7]<br>  <br>  <br>  1991 awakening<br>   <br>  One of the early explosive eruptions at Pinatubo after the April 1991 onset of ash eruptionsOn July 16, 1990, an earthquake of magnitude 7.7 struck central Luzon.[8] This was the largest earthquake recorded in 1990,[8] comparable in size to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Its epicenter was at Cabanatuan City, about 100 km northeast of Pinatubo, leading some volcanologists to speculate that it might ultimately have triggered the 1991 eruption, although this is impossible to prove conclusively. Two weeks after the earthquake, local residents reported steam coming from the volcano, but scientists visiting the mountain found that small landslides rather than any eruptive activity were responsible.<br>  <br>  On March 15, 1991, a succession of earthquakes was felt by villagers on the north-western side of the volcano. Further earthquakes of increasing intensity were felt over the next two weeks, and it became|`|vvLC5zaaaa	yeah i am looking for the same thing, theres noo information!! <br>  <br>  can you answer mine - <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309023829AAMqmQr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  if i find a site, i will let you no<br>  <br>  good luck

Find out what their course requirements are to get into their pharmacy program.  It's mostly the general/organic chem bio physics calculus and all the other core stuff (diff. schools require diff courses you must take prior to entering their pharm program).  You also need to take the PCAT.  Diff. schools have diff. requirements for which courses you need, what PCAT scores you need, and what GPA you need.<br>  If your PCAT scores aren't super, your GPA should be super to I guess make up for it in a way.  If your GPA isn't too great, your PCAT need to be great.
QKO4f5q0aa	Most people are saying 'yes', but my answer is a bit different.<br>  <br>  Here's the gist: When the Sun stops burning hydrogen and starts burning helium, it will turn into a red giant star.  The outer envelope of the sun will become much larger and will in all likelihood expand to the position of Earth's orbit.  <br>  <br>  The question is this: Will the Earth be there when that happens?   In order for the sun to start burning helium, the core of the sun will have to shrink and become much more dense.   As this happens during the millions of years leading up to the 'helium flash', more and more of the sun's mass will be concentrated in the core.  As this happens, the 'shape' of the gravity well will change, and the planets will slowly drift outwards in their orbits.   <br>  <br>  Will the Earth drift out far enough to escape being swallowed by the sun?   The answer turns out to be "maybe".  It's within the margin of error of the calculations.  <br>  <br>  Having said all of that, you should also know that it makes no difference.  As the sun ages it is slowly getting warmer.  Within 2 billion years or so, long before the sun goes into it's red giant phase, the Earth will not be habitable.    So, if the sun swallows the Earth at some point in the future, it will be the bone-dry, baked cinder that was once the 'water planet'.|`|c56e8a27e1fe5b4843f30c8834cc5d35aa	It's not the Earth that will fall into the sun.  When the sun becomes a red giant, the greater solar winds still won't be strong enough to push the Earth out of harm's way.  And the Earth will have been cremated long before it's vaporized, so don't worry about it too much.  Besides, I doubt if we'll be around in seven billion years when this gets to be a problem.|`|LYnK4xb0aa	yes one day it will happen ,,the wind will not push us|`|uymZEWp6aa	yes but not before approx. 5 billion yrs,so dont fear and enjoy ur life|`|gsyhNAiRaa	supposedly in a few billion years the sun will become a red giant and expand to the area of about where mars is. Yes the earth will be destroyed but the good news is that we will all be dead before that happens so no worries. Oh and if soar winds were strong enough to push earth then they would most likely penetrate the atmosphere and kill life on earth so either way we're dead! :)|`|J3TGyOnDaa	Yes, it is true, but that is not going to happen for another 4.5 billion years. The solar wind is is not pushing the Earth away right now, and the sun is a lot more energetic now than when it becomes a red giant star.|`|AA12124533	yes sun will b come a red giant and swallow planets uptil almost earth!!!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	In about 6 billion years, that will probably happen.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Yes, moving things that move by themselves in almost-indetectable breezes is definitely the easiest thing to do, since you're not actually doing anything at all.  You started tingling because you were sitting in the same position for 5 minutes not moving.  It's easy to think you're moving a flame or a tiny piece of paper or a flywheel because those thing don't need your help to move anyway.  If you picked something that would need your help - like a heavy book on the floor - you and the guy who wrote the website would have a lot harder job fooling yourselves.<br>  <br>  I remember someone who thought they could do this tried to go for the million dollar prize a few years ago <a href="http://www.randi.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.randi.org</a> .  They protocol they decided on was a flame under a glass (a large one with plenty of oxygen for a while) and moving it on command.  Of course, he couldn't do that.  Because he wasn't doing it.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	I'm sorry but I can light a flame and watch it, and it will do all sorts of motions, none of which are related to me or my efforts.  It will do that jumping up and down thing too.  Sometimes it will go out with me doing nothing.  It's just the wick or the wax not working as planned.<br>  <br>  I think what happens is that there is a high flame, and the flame makes the wax drip a little faster, and that fast wax sort of dampens the flame.  Then the flame eats the wax and gets high again.  This causes the jumping behavior.  <br>  <br>  Skip the flame motion and just try to extinguish the flame with your mind.  Or skip the Vulcan mind tricks altogether and try a different tool than a candle.  Try moving a paperclip or a pencil.|`|4JqwBJTSaa	Huh , I will be honest I have never tried anything like that.<br>  But it does interest me.

Candle flames are too unstable, and even though you weren't breathing on it, being in a large open space, anything (such as an undetected breeze or draft) could have caused it to jump.  I've even seen the flames of candles jump because of the vibration of someone walking down a hall in an apartment building, or cars driving by outside.  <br>  <br>  Yes, you did get a feeling that I get when I would meditate or use guided relaxation, but there is a slight difference here.  You say that you forced yourself to sit still, which basically causes your body to constrict blood flow, causing numbness and tingling.  Another thing that could have caused it is the fact that you were trying to control your breathing to the point of actually holding your breath.  Even when I meditated or did guided relaxation, I made sure to keep my breathing even and not allow my body to stay "stagnant" too long.  <br>  <br>  Not saying you didn't experience anything...it is odd (though not impossible) that the candle relit, but rather that, if you truly believe you truly experienced this, you should try for something a little larger such as a coin or a book.|`|nM7xmhgiaa	In a large room the heat of the candle flame itself sets up a local thermal siphon breeze.<br>  Also when the wick of a candle is too long the molten wax tends to flow up by capillary action in a irregular fashion.

Over the next quarter century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence attained in 1944.

RRFiy9CAaa	I understand your notation a/b to mean a divides b. a/b means there exists an integer m such that b = ma. Similarly, a/c means there exists an integer n such that c = na. So sb + tc = s(ma) + t(na) = (sm+tn)a i.e. a divides sb + tc.
RRFiy9CAaa	101 is prime, so by Fermat's Little Theorem 5^(100) = 1 mod 101. In the following steps, "=" means equals mod 101. So 5^123 = (5^100)(5^23) = 5^23 = 5^(3*7 + 2) = [(5^3)^7]25 = (125^7)25 = (24^7)25 = 24^(2*3+1)25 = (576^3)(24)(25) = (71^3)600 = (71^3)95 = 34001545 = 97.<br>  <br>  So 5^123 = 97 mod 101.

9lzNDwhZaa	Today, gold mines contain shafts that carry personnel and equipment as much as 2995 metres in one drop / rise as found at the South Deep gold mine in South Africa. This is possible as a result of titanium metal hoists and is a fairly recent advance in technology. There are also underground mining accessed by ramps that allow large trucks into and out of the mines.<br>  <br>  In 1850, there were gold mines that accessed ore both through horizontal development into the sides of hills (adits) and by vertical drop shafts. Sometimes, people would have to climb down into their work places - this still goes on within the informal mining sector in parts of Africa and Asia. Within the formal sector, small drop shafts (by hoist) and adits continue to be used.<br>  <br>  The biggest difference today, is a breakthrough in mineral processing technology that took place in 1886 which, interestingly was the same year that the gold deposits of the Witwatersrand basin in South Africa were first significantly worked.<br>  <br>  The technological breakthrough was that extraction of the gold through dissolution in sodium cyanide meant that gold need no longer be recovered by gravitational separation. In practise this meant that mining could continue to depth well below the water table / oxide cap into the sulphide zone. Gold ore within the sulphide zone is usually (but not essentially) occuring as microscopic particles within such sulphides as pyrite and arsenopyrite. By crushing this ore and dissolving in cyanide, the gold can now be economically recovered.<br>  <br>  In 1850, gold mining did not normally go beyond the oxide zone. Within the oxide zone, the original pyrite mineralogy has been oxidised to iron oxides and was therefore amenable to gravitational separation. <br>  <br>  A further problem in 1850 was the effeciency of mine pumps. Today, mining at 3000 metres below surface does not prove a problem as dewatering and cool air circulation make such work not just possible but relatively easy. In 1850, it was not just the change to sulphide mineralogy that posed a problem but inefficient pumps also made access to the lowest levels difficult too.

You are given x(x+10)=24 and in order to simplify this you have to distribute the x into the (x + 10)<br>  <br>  This will give you <br>  X^2 + 10x = 24<br>  And since the standard form tells you that ax^2 + bx + c=0, you have to move the 24 over because you need all numbers and variables on one side.<br>  <br>  To get rid of the 24 from the other side you have to subtract the (opposite) by 24 on both sides (a law that tells you what you do to one side you must do to the other. It's confusing and it would take an unbearably long time to explain so ill skip it.)<br>  <br>  So this is what you're actually doing X^2 + 10x -24 = 24 - 24<br>  <br>  And you will end up with X^2 + 10X - 24 = 0<br>  <br>  and that is your answer.<br>  <br>  I hope i explained it clear enough to you.<br>  <br>  Wish you luck with the math ^^.<br>  <br>  Take Care. ^^.|`|x8RNeeLXaa	x^2 + 10x - 24 = 0
z2BnPqO1aa	speed and velocity are the same, unless you are talking about instantaneous velocity and average speed.<br>  <br>  Average speed should be a tangent line or the first derivative<br>  <br>  Instantaneous velocity is the second derivative.|`|a06Be5h3aa	The 2 graphs would not look the same, which is obvious if you consider the difference between speed and velocity. Speed is the time derivative of the total distance traveled of a moving object, whereas the velocity is the time derivative of the object's distance from its starting location to its present location. An object may travel at a constant speed for 10 s at 10 m/s away from its starting location then immediately turn around (assume instantaneously) and travel at the same speed for 10 s, returning to its starting point. The speed time graph would look like a straight horizontal line at y = 10, since speed is a scalar quantity. However, since velocity is a vector, the velocity time graph would show the horizontal line y = 10 from 0 to 10 s and immediately jump to y = -10 from 10 s to 20 s.

It is the fundamental basis of biology.<br>  <br>  Evolution does not work at the level of the single atom.<br>  <br>  There will always be gaps.  Every time the paleontologists find a new specimen to fill a gap, it creates two smaller gaps.  The point is not to explain the gaps.  Rather it is evolution by natural selection that explains all of the growing number of data points.  Any competing theory to evolution must also explain all of the physical evidence that we now have.  <br>  <br>  Concerning love, humans are not the only species to love.  We share that with many vertebrates.  Look at the mutually loving relationship that people share with their dogs and cats.  Other animals also dream.  Other animals also reason.  Just watch a squirrel planning how to jump from one tree to the next.  Trial and error is too dangerous.  They actually foresee the possibilities before choosing one that works.  That is reasoning.  The only thing other vertebrates lack is the richness of the human language.<br>  <br>  The whole point is that questions about evolution do not constitute evidence for any alternative.  Whatever alternative one suggests for evolution, it must be better at explaining all of the physical evidence that does the theory of evolution.|`|bb309e8ae443e7204ff3491b1af57778aa	Someone asked a question like yours not too long ago.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of evidence for evolution. Scientists observe microevolution and predict this could have occured in a much more drastic scale and archeologists find fossils that suggest a gradual change to more complex organisms. There's carbon dating and the similarities in genetic code.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of problems with the theory too. For example, most mutations we observe today are harmful and generally lead to death or severe impairment and are not generally beneficial. People also point to the extreme improbability of all those events occuring in the interval between now and the estimated age of the earth. Fossil record shows punctuated equilibrium, not a gradual change etc.<br>  <br>  We just don't know!

t04fjMcyaa	NO!  This is what's so silly about it all.  Your puny clock does not do anything to the sun or to the amount of daylight of any given day, and to think so is just ridiculous.  The sun will rise and set whenever it’s appointed to rise and set, irrespective of all the alarm clocks on planet earth.  The whole idea behind DST is for people who run their lives by an alarm clock—it tells them when to wake up and when to go to sleep.  But you can do that any time you want.  You don’t need a clock to “take advantage of daylight.”  Just rise whenever the sun does, and go to bed whenever the sun sets.  That’s the way to get the most out of each day, no matter what time of the year it is.  It’s that simple.  The birds are doing just fine, and they have no idea what DST is.  Stop running your life by an alarm clock.  The problem is, of course, when your boss tells you to be there at 9:00 every morning.  What they call "9:00" must change, because our earth is tilted on its axis to give us some variety.  That's why they tell you to change what you call "9:00" during the summer months.  It's easier to change the clock twice a year than to keep adjusting your clock a little bit each day, which would be the best way not to feel any effects.  But you would never have to worry about that if they said to come in to your office at sun up or thereabouts.

I think somewhere in there a student talks about how they found HCl to be less accurate then H2SO4. Taking into account errors and such, even if you have got the wrong answers, as long as you POINT OUT that you realise this and show formulas etc to show why you came to this conclusion, then state why you think it went wrong, you should gain the marks, despite the mistakes.

AA11513203	True!<br>  <br>  This is a little tricky ... and you might get different answers depending on what dictionaries you check ... so I would recommend going to a scientific or biological dictionary (see source).   So perhaps your teacher is asking this more as an exercise in getting you to think, than concluding there is a single right answer.<br>  <br>  "Anterior/posterior" means frontwards or rearwards as the animal faces or moves.<br>  "Ventral/dorsal" means towards the belly-side or the back-side of the animal.<br>  <br>  In a fish (like a shark), "anterior/posterior" refers to head vs. tail ... while "ventral/dorsal" refers to the belly of the fish vs. the back (where the dorsal fin) is.<br>  <br>  Same with most land animals that walk on all fours ... anterior means "towards the head", while "ventral" means "towards the ground."  They are different.<br>  <br>  But in a biped, like a human, that walks upright, "anterior" and "ventral" mean the same thing.   That's because when we stand upright, we face and move in the same direction our "belly" is pointing.<br>  <br>  (Aside: It's a little ambiguous with a chimp, as they are not fully bipedal animals, but an animal somewhat midway between quadruped and biped ... they sometimes walk on all fours, sometimes upright.   But for the most part, the same applies ... the anterior of a chimp is usually the same as his ventral side.)<br>  <br>  If this is confusing ... draw a quick picture of a fish, a dog, and a man (standing sideways), and draw arrows labeled "anterior (frontwards)" and "ventral".   You will see that in fish and dogs "anterior" points towards the side of the page, and "ventral" points to the bottom of the page ... but in a man, both arrows point in the same direction ... towards the side of the page.|`|AA10264916	False,<br>  <br>  Anterior and ventral both refer to the front side of the body (the side with your face to be specific).<br>  <br>  Posterior and Dorsal refer to the back side of the body when the in anatomical position.<br>  <br>  The same thing applies to chimps.|`|YR78bGIaaa	false|`|kB63WTfdaa	No
M6AySVxOaa	Certainly, the proof is in the image you see in the mirror. If you see your image in the mirror you are looking into the past. This is because the light reflect from your body traveled a distance before it hits the mirror and traveled a distance to your eye from the mirror. The reason this doesn't look like it is the past is because light travels so fast but we know from logic that it takes time to travel so that by the time the light has hit your eye a new event has commenced that will take time to be seen.

First, what exists outside, before, or after our universe is impossible to say, since we cannot measure or experience it.<br>  <br>  The most likely scenario, which also explains what the inside of the pre-universe singularity would look like, is that there was nothing, no space, no time, just an impossibly condensed point of energy. When the energy expanded, it began to create the universe, time, space, and eventually, matter, from the energy present before the big bang.<br>  <br>  However, as even Stephen Hawking has noted, there is really no way to know for sure, so the best choice is to think about it in whatever terms make most sense to you, either rationally  or emotionally.|`|ICel15qYaa	this is almost a philosophical question<br>  what was outside was not matter, i guess<br>  or it could be existing in two states, or no state at all, like proved by schrodingers cat existing in two states in schrodingers thought process|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	We don't know; whatever else there was is outside our universe, and we can't see outside our universe.

Finding an Earth-like planet would of course be one of the breakthroughs of the century. It would solve many unanswered questions about the galaxy and change many an outlook on our place in the universe. <br>  <br>  The effect on the world in general would depend on whether anyone could prove it had life on it, and that would be the hard part. I imagine once the planet has been discovered, it would take a further 20 years to develop the technology to detect life.<br>  <br>  But if somehow evidence could be proved to suggest that an intelligent alien species was living on such a planet, then I think religion would be the hardest hit. There may be hysteria, denial or rebirths of religion recycled from others incorporating the new-found existence of other humanoids. Views of science fiction would change, and who's to say how literature may have to adapt to this new knowledge. It may cause war, it may usher in peace, who knows. No doubt the US Government will have a hand in how the information is handled, be it in full, doctored or witheld altogether.<br>  <br>  I'm not religious, so I do not care, in fact, I think such a discovery would be the most thrilling thing to experience in a lifetime, and I can't wait for the results of the Kepler probe. <br>  <br>  The saddest part would be the anticlimax of discovery and not being able to do anything about it. NASA or any other space agency does not have the technology to traverse the void and make contact. The least they could do is fire some encoded radiowaves at the planet and attempt to make contact. The planet's location would be logged and gather dust on a shelf somewhere for centuries until the technology became available, and we will all go back to our day jobs carry on with our lives.|`|L59NE1yLaa	I'd be ecstatic that we had proof, but not hugely surprised from a strictly probability point of view.

BrarMA1Haa	1.  Stainless steel is a bad choice.  It is hardly magnetic.  Air has a relative permeability of 1.  Stainless steel permeability typically runs around 1.05-1.1, although it can be increased some through work-hardening.  But basically, it's virtually the same as if you had an air core.<br>  <br>  Normal steel runs about 700.  Soft iron can run 7,000-50,000:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_core#Common_magnetic_core_materials" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_co...</a><br>  <br>  What this means is if the relative permeability is 700, then you need only 1/700th of the current to develop the same force.  Or the same current would develop 700 times the force, up to the point that the core saturates (there is a limit to how much magnetic flux a given material can support).<br>  <br>  Since you said computer power supply, I take it that you will be running this on DC, so don't consider using materials designed for high frequency.<br>  <br>  2.  The larger the cross section, the more magnetic flux can be supported before saturation.<br>  <br>  3.  Tight is best.<br>  <br>  4.  Threaded = stranded?  Using the thinnest insulation is best so that the average diameter of the layers of coils is the smallest.  Thus, magnet wire is usually used.  It has a thin enamel coating (or similar finish).<br>  <br>  5.  There is a shape and formula that maximizes inductance an minimizes wire usage.  I don't have it at my fingertips...<br>  <br>  6.  You cannot allow bare metal to touch or it will short out electrically.  The wire has to have some form of insulation.<br>  <br>  7.  Holes will reduce the effective relative permeability (because now part of the cross-sectional area is air, and its relative permeability of 1 averages in).  Inductance will decrease.  Strength will decrease.  Current will increase.  Perpedicular holes also will reduce the effective cross-sectional area.<br>  <br>  8.  Start at lowest setting.  Measure the current and see if it is greater than what the wire is rated at.  See if the coil gets hot.  Since you are using DC, I think that you will have to limit the current in some fashion since only the circuit resistance will dictate current flow in the steady state.  The inductance only impedes AC, not DC.  You can look up the DC resistance of 20 AWG and calculate what the circuit resistance will be, then divide that number into 5V to determine current in amps.  Compare that value to the rating for 20 AWG wire.  If it is anywhere near the rating, then you will have to limit current or add more wire.

stAeoUeSaa	If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.<br>  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:<br>  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodingers_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence</a> <br>   <br>  The Bible also alludes to the ‘Big Rip’: <br>  Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip</a>|`|eNMRIKL6aa	No one knows how the universe was created.

But to our best knowledge, no creator exists (besides, that just raises more questions - where did the creator come from?  if the creator is eternal, why can't the universe be eternal? and so on).  Our universe began in the big bang (which was an expansion, not an explosion) 13.7 billion years ago.  This is supported by all observations (WMAP and the cosmic microwave background, Hubble and the expanding universe) and there is no evidence to support the other ideas (steady state was an actual theory before we found evidence for the big bang; the rest are just superstitions and not scientific - since you're asking this in the science section, I'm assuming you're looking for a science-based answer).

30XHbV35aa	Your reference to isotropic confuses me: do you mean an isotropic material (i.e. one with the same properties in every direction) or an isotropic stress state (one with the same stresses in every direction)? The latter is very restrictive, describes what happens in a fluid not a solid, and has no shear stresses anywhere - the three Mohr's circles of stress collapse to a single point in the isotropic stress case.<br>  <br>  tau_xy = tau_yx always if there is no acceleration, as a consequence of equilibrium. Consider looking down on a unit cube element of the material subject to a uniform stress field i.e. you see a unit square of the material. On the top (+y) face is a shear stress t_yx pointing to the right, so on the bottom (-y) face is a shear stress t_yx pointing to the left (equal and opposite reactions with the next element). On the right (+x) face is a shear stress t_xy pointing upwards and on the left (-x) face is a shear stress t_xy pointing downwards. Now take moment equilibrium about the centre of the square:<br>  2*(0.5?x)*(?y*tau_xy) = 2*(0.5?y)*(?x*tau_yx)<br>  and you see that the ?x and ?y terms cancel out (for the square, ?x = ?y anyway) to leave:<br>  tau_xy = tau_yx<br>  <br>  Situations where this doesn't hold are those for which the system is not in moment equilibrium i.e. there is an angular acceleration, and those in which there is a point moment being applied. The latter is a mathematical concept rather than a real one. If the shear stresses vary across the unit element, you end up with a differential equation for the stress distributions. However, t_xy = t_yx still holds since the unit element can be made arbitrarily small and the stress difference therefore made arbitrarily small relative to the actaul value.|`|x5Wet11Naa	A isotropic solid must have uniformity in all directions.  That is hat isotropic means.  If the shear stress wasn't uniform, then it would be a anisotropic. The values that you use must be identical for the forces to be zero or the values will be skewed.  Thats why the force calculation usually done with static analysis is always done to F(x), F(y) or F(Z)=0.|`|slKxSYpHaa	If the substance is as your teacher suggested, isotropic, these shear stresses need to be equal otherwise you wouldn't have equilibrium.

Another early process is physical breakup or fragmentation of the plant material into smaller bits which have greater surface area for microbial colonization and attack. In smaller dead plants, this process is largely carried out by the soil invertebrate fauna, whereas in the larger plants, primarily parasitic life-forms such as insects and fungi play a major breakdown role and are assisted by numerous detritivore species. Following this, the plant detritus (consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose, microbial products, and lignin) undergoes chemical alteration by microbes. Different types of compounds decompose at different rates. This is dependent on their chemical structure. For instance, lignin is a component of wood, which is relatively resistant to decomposition and can in fact only be decomposed by certain fungi, such as the white-rot fungi. Said fungi are thought to be seeking the nitrogen content of lignin rather than its carbon content. Lignin is one such remaining product of decomposing plants with a very complex chemical structure causing the rate of microbial breakdown to slow. Depending on where the plant is being decayed will tell you if it will be a fast decaying process, or a slow decaying process. A plant in a warm environment will decay faster.

Oxidation occurs at a molceular level and can be defined as the loss of at least one e- (electron) when two or more substances interact. Oxygen that is present in the air causes free radicals on the apple's surface causing it to go brown.|`|AA12007810	Bacterial decomposition and browning of apples are two distinct processes.<br>  Browing is due to an enzyme called poly-phenol oxidase which is present in the apple tissue. When this enzyme comes in contact with oxygen from air, it oxidises the constituents of apple. Since these oxidized entities are brown in colour, the cut apple - upon exposure to air - turns brown. <br>  <br>  Essentially during microbial spoilage too, this action of apple enzymes is induced, and therefore there are similarities in appearance of apples.

Multilinearity says that<br>  <br>  (1) D(ka+la',b,c,d) = k D(a,b,c,d) + l D(a',b,c,d) for any vectors a, a', b, c, d and scalars k, l<br>  (2) D(a,kb+lb',c,d) = kD(a,b,c,d) + lD(a,b',c,d) for any vectors a, b, b', c, d and scalars k, l<br>  (3) D(a,b,kc+lc',d) = kD(a,b,c,d) + lD(a,b,c',d) for any vectors a, b, c, c', d and scalars k, l<br>  (4) D(a,b,c,kd+ld') = kD(a,b,c,d) + lD(a,b,c,d') for any vectors a, b, c, d, d' and scalars k, l<br>  <br>  In somewhat less precise terms, you fix any 3 of the 4 rows of the matrix, the determinant is a linear function of the remaining row.<br>  <br>  Here you know<br>  <br>  D(v1,v2,v3,v4) = 5.  By the above properties<br>  <br>  D(3v1+7v2,5v1+7v2,v3,v4)<br>  = 3 D(v1,5v1+7v2,v3,v4) + 7 D(v2,5v1+7v2,v3,v4)<br>  (using (1) with a=v1, a' = v2, k=3, l=7, b=5v1+7v2, c=v4, d=v4)<br>  = 3 [5 D(v1,v1,v3,v4) + 7 D(v1,v2,v3,v4)] + 7 [5D(v2,v1,v3,v4) + 7D(v2,v2,v3,v4)]<br>  (using first (2) with a = v1, b=v1, b' = v2, k=5, l=7, c=v3, d=v4, and then (2) with a=v2, b=v1, b'=v2, k=5, l=7, c=v3, and d=v4)<br>  <br>  Now use the fact that if a matrix has two rows the same, its determinant will be zero.  This tells us that the second and fourth terms above are 0, and we get<br>  <br>  = 21 D(v1,v2,v3,v4) + 35 D(v2,v1,v3,v4)<br>  <br>  Now use the fact that if you swap two rows in a matrix, the determinant changes sign, to get<br>  <br>  = 21 D(v1,v2,v3,v4) - 35 D(v1,v2,v3,v4)<br>  = -14 D(v1,v2,v3,v4)<br>  = -14(5)<br>  = -70

And I don't know what c is that you're talking about.  There's no c anywhere in the equation.  With one equation and two unknowns, there are an infinite amount of solutions.  For example if y = 0, then x = 20, or if <br>  y = 10 then x = 15.  You can pick any value for either x or y and just solve for the other.

However, Varian Inc has a special column to analyze the specific amines you mention. It is called CP-Volamine and is described in the following web site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.varianinc.com/cgi-bin/nav?products/consum/gccolumns/select/cpvol&cid=JMONNIJKFL" rel="nofollow">http://www.varianinc.com/cgi-bin/nav?pro...</a>|`|CNSw4Chgaa	The oxygen atom transfer–electron transfer (ET) mechanistic dichotomy has been investigated in the oxidation of a number of aryl sulfides by H2O2 in acidic (pH 3) aqueous medium catalysed by the water soluble iron(III) porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine-... acid iron(III) chloride (FeTPPSCl). Under these reaction conditions, the iron–oxo complex porphyrin radical cation, P+ Fe(IV)O, should be the active oxidant. When the oxidation of a series of para-X substituted phenyl alkyl sulfides (X = OCH3, CH3, H, Br, CN) was studied the corresponding sulfoxides were the only observed product and the reaction yields as well as the reactivity were little influenced by the nature of X as well as by the bulkiness of the alkyl group. Labelling experiments using H218O or H218O2 clearly indicated that the oxygen atom in the sulfoxides comes exclusively from the oxidant. Moreover, no fragmentation products were observed in the oxidation of a benzyl phenyl sulfide whose radical cation is expected to undergo cleavage of the  C–H and C–S bonds. These results would seem to suggest a direct oxygen atom transfer from the iron–oxo complex to the sulfide. However, competitive experiments between thioanisole (E°= 1.49 V vs. NHE in H2O) and N,N-dimethylaniline (E°= 0.97 V vs. NHE in H2O) resulted in exclusive N-demethylation, whereas the oxidation of N-methylphenothiazine (10, E°= 0.95 V vs. NHE in CH3CN) and N,N-dimethyl-4-methylthioaniline (11, E°= 0.65 V vs. NHE in H2O) produced the corresponding sulfoxide with complete oxygen incorporation from the oxidant. Since an ET mechanism must certainly hold in the reactions of 10 and 11, the oxygen incorporation experiments indicate that the intermediate radical cation, once formed, has to react with PFe(IV)O (the reduced form of the iron–oxo complex which is formed by the ET step) in a fast oxygen rebound. Thus, an ET step followed by a fast oxygen rebound is also suggested for the other sulfides investigated in this work.
7w7gr0ccaa	None of the matrices you wrote are 3x3. B is 2x3 and C is 3x2<br>  Only square matrices have inverse, so you're not gonna find any method to invert a 2x3 matrix.<br>  <br>  There are several methods to find the inverse of a matrix, all of them quite hard to explain here. Check this link, it might help you:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_matrix" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_mat...</a><br>  <br>  I recommend Gaussian elimination, it's a fast and simple method|`|cabf56d794d5f75229ae80ef3688a2c4aa	I understand that only square matrices have inverses, and you've given only two rows for matrix B.<br>  <br>  If it were <br>  5 .. 6 .. 7<br>  8 .. 9 .. 10<br>  11. 9 .. 7<br>  then what I would do is elementary row operations to reduce this to the identity matrix, while doing the same operations on the identity matrix:<br>  So, do Row3 - Row2, then R2 - R1:<br>  <br>  5 .. 6 .. 7  and from unit matrix ... 1 ... 0 ... 0<br>  3 .. 3 .. 3 ...................................... -1 ... 1 ... 0<br>  3 .. 0 .. -3 ....................................... 0 ... -1 ... 1<br>  Now do R1 - 2*R2 then R2 - R3<br>  -1 .. 0 .. 1 ............................... 3 ... -2 ... 0<br>  0 ... 3 ... 6 ................................ -1 ... 2 ...-1<br>  3 .. 0 .. -3 ..................................... 0 ... -1 ...1<br>  <br>  Now if you add 3*R1 to R3, you get a zero row, which means the matrix is "singular", i.e. it has no inverse, so I made a bad choice for row 3.  If the matrix is not singular, eventually you can get it to equal<br>  1 ... 0 ... 0<br>  0 ... 1 ... 0<br>  0 ... 0 ... 1<br>  <br>  and whatever the unit matrix (on the right side) has become is the inverse.<br>  <br>  Another way is to use the formula.

Su Marte forse sono esistiti o esistono (ancora non è certo) microrganismi. si pensa che la presenza di metano e altri gas come ossigeno e anidride carbonica siano dovuti ai microrganismi su Marte. Il problema non è la presenza di elementi a noi sconosciuti, perché si conoscono ormai (quasi) tutti gli elementi della tavola periodica, eventuali elementi sconosciuti sono in genere radioattivi e decadono rapidamente. Di composti invece ce ne possono essere praticamente una infinità. la vita che noi conosciamo è basata sul carbonio elemento con proprietà che permettono la formazione di molte molecole complesse e stabili (organiche). la presenza di acqua preferibilmente allo stato liquido può favorire sicuramente la nascita della vita. il problema è la temperatura, l' acqua è un composto molto semplice e potrebbe essere presente nell'universo, la difficoltà sta nell'avere un pianeta che abbia una temperatura intermedia per far nascere la vita. di solito nell'universo c'è o una temperatura vicina allo zero assoluto o una temperatura molto alta, la fascia di temperatura "buona" è molto ristretta. di pianeti che possono ospitare la vita ne sono stati trovati. però la possibilità che ci sia una vita sufficientemente evoluta è sicuramente minore.<br>  zero è invece la probabilità che ci sia vita extraterrestre "fra noi" perché nelle nostre vicinanze non c'è grande possibilità di vita nell'universo (se non a livello primitivo come su Marte) quindi se esistessero degli alieni lontani impiegherebbero comunque anni e anni (centinaia o migliaia) per raggiungerci (anche se andassero alla velocità della luce). esiste un progetto scientifico serio per controllare se esistono segnali radio provenienti dallo spazio che siano generati da altre vite nell'universo: progetto SETI <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/</a> <br>  inoltre c'è da dire che noi la nostra parte l'abbiamo fatta: sono stati mandati molti segnali radio per vedere se qualcuno rispondeva. nessuna risposta perchè servono migliaia di anni perchè il segnale arrivi sufficientemente lontano e altrettanti anni per la risposta!! aspettiamo?|`|7Fv7dPU5aa	Si questo è possibile anche se la conoscenza della chimica non permette l'esistenza di altri elementi a meno che non cambiamo la fisica delle particelle elementari (atomi, elettroni, ecc..) e ciò comporterebbe cambiare le basi fisiche della nostra conoscenza dell'universo.

PsCCd63yaa	It depends on what you want to do in college and what college you go to.  If you're going to do anything requiring calculus (any science, or any math, and probably many economics programs), you DEFINITELY would want to go with math analysis.  That course sounds like it teaches you the material you need for calculus, which is the standard intro math class in college for math and science majors.<br>  <br>  If, however, you happen to really LIKE statistics, you could go with that...but personally, it makes more sense to take one of the AP calculus classes before even considering AP statistics.  Statistics is required for very FEW college level math/science classes...math analysis is required for calculus, and calculus is required for MANY higher level sciences.<br>  <br>  Additionally, I'm guessing that AP statistics is tough, just because it's AP.  Chances are if you're not mathematically advanced enough to do AP calculus, you'll have some difficulty keeping up with an AP stats course.  Calculus isn't required for statistics, but the skill sets required to do well in both are similar.|`|m7MhXTP8aa	It depends on the field you want to enter.  I think most colleges are hoping you're ready to start Calculus if you're a math, science, or engineering student.  Given what you've taken, I think Trig would be next in line.<br>  <br>  OTOH, AP *anything* looks good on a college application.  :-)<br>  <br>  You might be better asking this question to one of your math teachers, or a guidance counselor at school.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pk9JbCE8aa	Depending on how long you have been out of school, you will need to take an entrance exam. Depending upon your math score, your advisor will help you select the courses. Most public colleges(and<br>   universities) have foundation courses if you are weak in certain areas.<br>   Judging from your records, you should be in good Shape.<br>                                       Roger S|`|FEVQisMGaa	That's pretty much the bare minimum.<br>  <br>  To be a little competitive, you should have taken an AP Calculus class. AP Stats is meaningless if you don't take Analysis. You NEED Math Analysis more than Stats.<br>  <br>  Ideally you would have both, but Analysis is required in some cases, but Stats gives you a slight competitive edge.<br>  <br>  It also depends on the college admissions process.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Personally, I actually skipped pre-calc/analysis and did two years of AP Calculus. Junior and Senior year.<br>  <br>  Bad idea. I did fine (basic level calculus is actually easier than it seems). But there was so much work to catch up on (all of it from Analysis). I contemplated Stats, but I went for AP Comp Sci instead.<br>  <br>  The difficulty in statistics is FINDING a teacher who is suitable enough for it.<br>  <br>  The Head of my HS's math Department specialized in Calculus, and she refused to teach Stats because the knowledge required was NOT the same.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It doesn't seem to me that you're looking for a field in Mathematics... The highest levels of "math" that they generally teach in HS is a second year AP Calculus. Or Calculus BC.<br>  <br>  That's optional, but you're probably gonna need to learn it in college anyways. Some schools will take the credit from the AP test, but Ivy League schools negate it and just weigh it for admissions purposes.<br>  <br>  Again, it depends on the school.<br>  <br>  You're breakdown is fine, but you should have taken Analysis in your Junior year, and left senior year for AP Calculus AB.
GASTNilgaa	You can either take for granted that ABCD is a rectangle (ie, that ||AB|| = ||CD|| and ||BC|| = ||AD|| and that the segment pairs (AB, BC), (BC,CD), (CD, DA), (DA, AB) are perpendicular) or you can prove it.  Once you know it's a rectangle the diagonal directions are specified by the vector differences<br>  <br>  u = A-C and v = B-D.<br>  <br>  The angle between the diagonals is the angle between these vectors.  Since it's a rectangle, ||u|| = ||v|| = sqrt(354), and <br>  <br>  u dot v = 16.<br>  <br>  If t denotes the angle between u and v, <br>  <br>  cos t = (u dot v)/(||u|| ||v||) = 16/354 <br>  <br>  so that t = arccos(16/354) which is indeed around 87.4 degrees.<br>  <br>  (Depending on the choices you make in what the diagonals are--- you could also have let u = C-A and v = B-D or some mix of these choices and the ones I made earlier--- you might also get the other angle between the diagonals (there's two, an acute one and an obtuse one 92.59, and they are supplementary).
