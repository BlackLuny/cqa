UyUZ5SiGaa	Tellher.<br>  <br>  They're nothing to be worried about. I am 15 and i have them. I am NOT fat. <br>  <br>  Hate to break it to ya, but they're actually a common thing nowadays. You don't only get them because you're overweight, you can get them from growing too fast. I got mine because i grew too fast, and my skin stretched, thus forming stretch marks. Many girls have them. After they fade, you can hardly even tell they're there :)<br>  <br>  You need lotion with cocoa butter in it. I applied it everyday for about a month, and i saw some big improvements. Without the lotion, they'll still fade on their own, it'll just take longer.<br>  <br>  Its not gross, its life. You gotta deal with it. <br>  <br>  Remember-Whatever doesn't kill you, makes you that much stronger :)|`|whyQfKaJaa	nothing will make stretch marks disappear.|`|6wqb2Tdkaa	buy the cocoa butter in the block form and rub rub rub....its cheap abut use it at nights, if you want a tan then use during the day

But in the process it might kill your hair.<br>  I had a very dark shade of brown hair and it is now white blonde. It took a lot of fighting and a lot of bleach.

So you don't kill your hair.<br>  <br>  Good luck!?|`|jDRWWPfiaa	i wouldnt bleach it my friend had dirty blonde hair and she bleached a piece in the back of her hair by her neck so she could dye that little part a bright blue-it looked cute- but now the dye is out and its just like white and ugly and completely dead and it barely grows like its gonna take forever to grow out that part of her hair cause its so dead i dont reccomend doing it at all it makes your hair look nasty|`|Bt87yaApaa	yes you can bleach any color hair,<br>  but bleaching is very bad for your hair so be careful about what you do

AA11195732	These natural skin brighteners are far safer than many ingredients in commercial products.  For generations, honey, lemon juice, rose water, and turmeric have been used together and separately to improve skin and fade imperfections.<br>  <br>  If you have any doubts about how your skin will react to the ingredients, do a small patch test on the inside of your forearm.  Apply the ingredient, wait for 30 minutes, and look for a reaction.<br>  <br>  Have a look at www.oldenbuzz.com.  There are dozens of traditional recipes for skin care.<br>  <br>  Natural, homemade cosmetics are a great idea to try.  They're fun and cheap to use.  Good luck!

If your skin is pale, use Maybelline Mineral Power in translucent. It blends nicely and is great for your skin.  Go with a pink blush, creme-ishh tan eye shadow, mascara, and you're good to go.  I curl my eyelashes, apply a thin line of eyeliner, and I use Colossal Lashes mascara.  Use a cute lipgloss and you're good to go!<br>  <br>  Stay away from foundations and thick matte type stuff at first. Also, use a moisturizer before you apply the makeup.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|na56L61daa	since you've never worn makeup before and i don't know how old you are i will give you the same advice my mother gave me when i was a teen. the point of wearing makeup is to make it look like your not wearing any at all. buying makeup is hit and miss. even with experience you can still get something home and realize its all wrong.<br>  that being said, i can tell you that i have pale skin and blue/green eyes as well and tell you what i use. i love almay true match in light. it is a foundation that starts out white and changes to blend with your skin tone as you rub it in. they also have a conceler. i also use any blush that is in a pink tone. peaches tend to make me look washed out. i also use covergirl lash blast mascara in black, its fantastic. other than that i don't really use a lot of makeup. and if you want to use eyeshadows lots of makeup companies now have little kits for your exact eye color. i hope all this helped a little bit good luck|`|52yZwf0aaa	good for you i dont wear alot of makeup because remember natural makeup is key good luck buy avon mark products go to meetmark.com|`|9tNLDTsHaa	Well, let's cover the three basic areas: Eyes, lips, and cheeks.<br>  <br>  Eyes: A good starter eyeshadow color for a beginner is anything lighter. I'd suggest a baby pink, and if you want to be a little daring, use a light brown with some shimmer to it. Both the green and the blue in your eyes will be enhanced by the brown. The baby pink's more for an everyday look. USE EYESHADOW PRIMER, so you can rest assure that your eyeshadow won't crease or look funny after a couple hours. Mascara is for the more experienced makeup person, but if you want to try it, ask your mom to help. Usually moms LOVE to play makeup with their daughters. At least I know IIII would! haha! If you want mascara, get a darker brown/black. Black is a little harsh. Eyeliner's the same way. You don't want to go overboard! When you get more used to makeup, you can experiment with colors, but for now, stick with light and simple.<br>  <br>  Lips: You'll want to have your lip products in light pink or nude. Tinted lip balms are GREAT to start off with, because they're simple to use, and they give you just a hint of color. If you're afraid of using color on your lips at first, you can ease your way into it by using clear lip gloss, then gradually getting lip glosses with more color in them as time goes on. Glosses will be good for you to start, and if you want a good effect, try this: Tinted lip balm, and then top it off with a slightly tinted lip gloss. Your lips will be VERY soft and have just the amount of color you'd want for a beginner.<br>  <br>  Cheeks: Blush is tricky. If you don't put enough on, or none at all, you'll look washed out and unhealthy. If you put too much, you look like a clown or someone with a bad sunburn. The key to blush is to use JUST the right amount. Get a lighter pink color blush, get a blush powder brush(the better the quality, the better the result), and then smile. Where the apples of your cheeks appear (the round part of your cheek, what sticks out most), apply the blush, then blend it towards the back of your face, towards your ear. 1-2 dips into the blush is THE MOST you'll need. Repeat with the other side. It might not show up now, but the basic point of blush is to look natural. If you can clearly see it without much effort, then you've put too much on, and you just need to wipe some away, either by blending it in with the brush, or using a tissue and wiping it gently.<br>  <br>  These are just basic pointers. If you need more help, lemme know! I'd be glad to help! :D

oHsxp5weaa	You should try both hairstyles before your formal. It just depends on the shape of your face. Everyone is different. I personally think that straight bangs can go with curly, wavy, or just plain straight hair. But since you are wearing a one shoulder dress you might want to straighten your bangs but pin your hair in a nice messy bun to show off your shoulders.|`|Zynzkj1raa	Full bangs look better with curly hair.<br>  <br>  Side swept bangs look better with straight hair AND curly hair.|`|9vtXlIUBaa	STRAIGHT!|`|YPRfwMLWaa	they look cute if you have wavey hair and straighten them|`|fSn4KSuPaa	both. i think your hairstyle is even better than straight hair. <br>  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9Zf_P9g6cuo/STX-0AGhXcI/AAAAAAAACOw/nkkuyhVWj8c/s400/cute-asian-girl-hairstyle-1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9Zf_P9g6cuo/ST...</a><br>  straight is boooooooooring. im tired of everybody with straight hair and straight bangs!! do your loose curls and the outfit is awesome. :D|`|0JuLhrwdaa	my opinion is that straight hair would look better..but taylor swift has side bangs and curly hair and its really pretty, so i think either way would still look good.  but then again straight bangs and straight hair would look edgy and cute so go with the straight|`|KvOeZwWTaa	it usually looks better with all straight, because the bangs have to be straight and then if the hair is curly it just looks kinda dysfunctional sometimes...but whatever looks best with your outfit!|`|Yszx1HAgaa	i like to like pinned down staight. i think it would look really cure with striaghtened hair!<br>  i hope that hellep!|`|6jGiMsKIaa	well, i think straight bangs look really cute with wavy, shaped curls, like, not too corkscrew-ish, but not too messy either... lol, hope i helped :)|`|EQzds0odaa	in my opinion you should straighted your bangs.<br>  <br>  Your dress sounds gorgeous!<br>  <br>  have fun and good luck!<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)|`|Nc6CaYIVaa	definitely straight but if u don't have straight hair simple solution straighten itt|`|dXLMDGqDaa	with both|`|iZnXxTw2aa	it depends on what you think. I think that it looks good with straight, but if you want to curl it, just spiral curl your bangs with a 1/2" curling iron, and it will blend them in with the rest of your hair and look really cute.<br>  <br>  hope this helps! :)|`|aHM5JTWmaa	bangs look better with straight hair|`|avlVHXDCaa	it looks better with both my i say staraight for now lol|`|pw3y3Eo0aa	straight............

8osMkLe1aa	I like it because it makes my lashes long and thick without clumping. I love mascaras with the rubber bristles like Lash Blast has. It doesn't wear off or clump on me. It's the big orange tube.|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	the original is in the brigth orange tube, the red one is the new luxe formula which is supposed to bring out your eyes with shimmer. it seems to last all day for me. doesn't clump. lengthens :) :D but the loreal CLEAN DEFINITION is better-same effects but-well more defined :)|`|sPDQIxJTaa	it is the orange AND pink tube.<br>  the pink one is just a little bit sparkly.<br>  it stays on all day.<br>  doesn't smudge.<br>  doesn't clump. :)|`|kKPT2VCfaa	I do not like it.

It only works to it's fullest the first time you use it, then it's just like any other mascara. I suggest Loreal Lash Extensions.
yKsfl9g4aa	Milia are common non-cancerous (benign) skin findings in people of all ages. Milia formed directly from sloughed-off skin (primary milia) are small, fluid-filled lesions (cysts) usually found on the faces of infants and adults, while lesions formed indirectly (secondary milia) are small cysts found within areas of skin affected by another skin condition.<br>  <br>  Milia are formed when skin does not slough off normally but instead remains trapped in a pocket on the surface of the skin. An individual milium is formed (derived) from a hair follicle (pilosebaceous unit) or from a sweat gland (eccrine gland). In primary milia in infants, the oil gland (sebaceous gland) may not be fully developed. Secondary milia often develop after injury (trauma) or blistering of the skin, which disrupts and clogs the tubes (glandular ducts) leading to the skin surface. Secondary milia can also develop on the sun-damaged skin of middle-aged and older people.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cosmetic treatments such as microdermabrasion or chemical peels can help.<br>  <br>  Because these bumps are caused by dead skin cells becoming trapped under the skin, they will eventually disappear with proper exfoliation.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that helps =)<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|6CMfKxiMaa	uhm, i'm pretty sure there not because of make-up.<br>  i've seen them on guys too, and they don'tt wear make-up.<br>  but i got them a couple weeks ago, but now there gone.<br>  don't stress over it, they should just disappear.|`|gu5VM87xaa	pretty sure they come from eye makeup and not taking it off properly... <br>  <br>  i would just lay off the makeup for a few days<br>  <br>  hope i helped =)
v30TPwUtaa	Bronzers don't do anything in my opinion.<br>  Stick to the cyber ones if you have a tolerance.|`|dPsaYMOvaa	I have no idea what you are talking about, but I suggest that you don't use a tanning salon anyway.|`|77UaGGsLaa	I wouldn't go to the tanning salon at all. You're going to get cancer and die.|`|pINonh84aa	tanning=cancer
dPsaYMOvaa	You need to wash your face with a facewash every morning and night. Make sure you get all your makeup off, and use a moisturiser for dry skin as you doing. I would then suggest you buy some honey, and smear it on your face, and leave it for a while like a mask then wash it off. It sounds silly, but give it a try.|`|Ai6vvh5Faa	just put some powder on after using moisturiser to get rid of the shine|`|7f658f105cd5aae302407e4ba9430d51aa	aloe vera helps moisten our skin and it isnt oily at all<br>  but teh problem is doesnt work on all ppl<br>  and you need to reapply it on every few hours|`|7tnb4On2aa	Buy Cetaphil......a little goes a long way....it cleans gently, thoroughly....without drying.|`|52yZwf0aaa	use eveeno the best

RMppfinbaa	My mom is a dermatologist. So I know a few tricks :)<br>  Firstly, do not I repeat do NOT put toothpaste on it. It sounds like you have a in-grow pimple or a cyst. The best thing to do it to put a hot, not burning hot out of desperation because that will burn your skin, the puss from underneath will look like a quarter size mess of yellow on your face. So, moderate hot water dipped in a small amount of salt for about 5 minutes on your bump. Then, for about 3 minutes, put an ice pack. Always rap the pack in something so that it won't stick or chock your skin. You may also want to take if you have handy, and I know this may sound weird, but birth control can reduce and potentially clear acne. My acne has cleared thanks to this. Also, it's important not to touch it because this will irritate your skin and cause it to inflame even more. Avoid perfumed facial lotion because that can irritate it too. Covering it up with concealer may bother it too. <br>  Hope this helps. DOn't worry, it'll eventually go away.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mine please? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtwJt7hUP.sCaUIEPU.dNrfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308074224AAhZGAq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|sPDQIxJTaa	maybe it's not a pimple?|`|lnAHFUySaa	I have lots of acne and trust me, one pimple under your eye is nothing to get all worked up about. I suggest using some face creams and pimple killers, such as Proactive or other store bought items and just wait until it leaves. And keep using face creams even after it is gone so that it doesn't come back, oh, and drink lots of water.|`|ahacDrbYaa	if its red and swollen,<br>  you should put toothpaste on the pimple right before you go to bed.<br>  and then when you wake up in the morning wash it off.<br>  some of the redness will be gone.<br>  <br>  ok it sounds wierd but belive me it really does help.|`|1378862e7f14f3d6b3ca9f2e14f3ba94aa	try to pop it or even use a needle to pop it and i promise it dusnt hurt b/c ur skin is swelled so the skin above it is numbed.<br>  <br>  see wut comes out of it.|`|kt4Oueixaa	well it could be a cyst, id just try not to make it too noticeable and wait for the appointment.
jUj4sdnfaa	it really depends on the occasion that the dress is being designed for. as a whole i like the second one because its really fun.|`|xo5W1q2Raa	i like the fit of the 4th dress i hate how the 2nd one hangs and the pattern on the 3rd ones nice i love the fairytale feel of the last one|`|H4Hthtouaa	I really like the first one! It's a great color and the neckline is amazing! But it kinda clashes with the top bottom of the dress. Maybe a little looser? or flowy ?<br>  <br>  Good luck with your designs!<br>  :)|`|zzARSWVAaa	I like the last one. It reminds me of a fairytale. I think the first one is too short, but that's just my opinion.|`|avdEUZN0aa	I like the first one the best (:<br>  Haha|`|dQ0UyNSzaa	third or fouth...first 2 kinda short and tight. i like looser dresses personally|`|549htJWVaa	last two|`|Vm6b4GjEaa	my favorite is the fourth one|`|CpotQhwkaa	if i had to pick i guess 2. i really like the last one, but for a more casual i guess 2.|`|JERUmEFzaa	I like the first one.

Don't change a thing!|`|DTg3USppaa	Just so you know, you are very pretty!! You have a very pretty skin tone as well, so I'd say throw some darker blondes (almost goldish) and some red (not bright but noticable!) <br>  <br>  Also, I know that a lot of women get underneith like a very dark brown or black... that would be cute too!!|`|LDOQK4Daaa	first off i have to say ur gorgeous second u should get blonde highlights or colour it redish brown and get dark balck highlights and maybe some layers and short ones on top for volume i think u wod look great! :D|`|t1VXsGpwaa	No I really like your hair color!

As for your hair, perhaps getting it cut in layers would be very nice.

l35YJd33aa	Hey!  Okay, so I would really reccommend contouring your face.  It makes your face look a little thinner and more defined, like a supermodel.  This takes away the babyfat in the cheeks, making your face appear longer, slimmer, and more elegant- therefore older.<br>  <br>  Here is the youtube video by xsparkage that taught me how to do it.  her other videos are great also: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdkLvBJJsEM&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdkLvBJJs...</a><br>  <br>  Okay so now for the eyes.<br>  Go for a light smokey eye look.  Dark enough to look sexy and smouldering which will make you appear older but not too dark- dont wanna look emo!  here's a video showing you how to achieve this look: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OqUiNCpwog" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OqUiNCpw...</a><br>  <br>  good luck!|`|N3qnOlehaa	I think that getting that flawless, polished look is really mature. You probably wouldn't want to go to tryouts wearing pink glittery eyeshadow and hot pink lipstick.  <br>  <br>  I would wear a medium brown eyeshadow that's a couple shades darker than your skin tone all over the lid, then put a slightly darker shade of brown in the crease. Then wear dark brown eyeliner on the upper and lower lashes. Put a shimmery, but not too shimmery, champagne color on the brow bone. Then, finish it off with mascara. <br>  <br>  For lips, wear a light pink gloss that's pretty natural looking, but you should still be able to tell it's on. <br>  <br>  Then put on foundation if you need it, but make sure that it's not cakey or anything. <br>  <br>  Find the apples of your cheeks (smile, you'll be able to tell wear they are) and put on a nice natural but pretty blush. <br>  <br>  Fill in your brows if you need it. Nobody looks mature with over plucked eyebrows. <br>  <br>  I really hope this helps make you look more mature! Oh and good luck with the CFT cheerteam tryouts! I'm also a dancer as well, and i know how stressful it can be [=|`|l5zJ1bldaa	Eyeliner (do a cat eye if you want a sexy look), smokey eye, use foundation then enhance your cheekbones by using blush, tan, dye your hair darker or lighter, something extreme and totally unexpected. add layers, get bangs, tease your hair, get big/bold/lush eyelashes by using a eyelash curler then go over it with mascara. =)|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Why would you wanna look older if you're 20?|`|liaUiZVgaa	Natural look, and honestly, how you present yourself is based on how old you are.  I'm 21, and I look like I'm 18.  However, I act older.  So some older people thought I was older, like 25-30.  Weird, I know.

D2cj05Jdaa	20$ no cause i pay and the hair dresser messed up my hair sometimes but sometimes they do my hair awesome so its alright|`|X7xPm7oEaa	I would say it depends on how much hair you have, usually for me (guy) it costs about 25$ w.o tip for a good haircut, most of my girlfriends tell me it costs about the same, maybe 30$ for theirs. A small trim at a random barber or salon obviously will most likely be cheap, at about 10-15$, but obviously your getting what you paid for.|`|fPpmgxjuaa	I paid ten bux...i used to get it cut for free but my barber moved to AZ...so now i have to go wit my other friend and i pay him ten bux.|`|6Lxhj1rdaa	$20.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	$25 w/o tip.|`|C9TG1ORMaa	30-60 dollars, it always depends on how I get my hair done (:|`|PTydjBFHaa	for my cut, color, highlight, and blow dry plus tip 150 when its all said and done. but i love my stylist and always leave SOOO happy and have had a really hard time finding a good one i trust and like so i'm willing to pay extra for my happiness.|`|2UulDiWzaa	Up to 300 dollars.<br>  Here's why.

About a month later I tried to change my haircolor back to blonde, it wouldnt go back!! My hair started to grow out a bit and I still didnt have my normal haircolor back, despirate I colored it blonde again about 2 weeks later, Now I have to put up with multi-layers of blondes because of this.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you pick a color that is really pretty and you wont regret!!|`|XCG6ejG5aa	Blonde with caramel highlights.|`|D2cj05Jdaa	I think you should get highlight of ether Black nd brown or brown nd blonde personal i think brown ans blonde would look cute with  blue Eyes person don't you think here's some photos|`|z8ifnTEaaa	Since you have paler skin, you want to stay away from really dark browns or black shades because they will just wash you out. <br>  Instead, go for a nice light ash or golden brown which will brighten you up :) <br>  good luck:)|`|WKAqqYXEaa	Don't go to dark or you'll look washed out.<br>  Stay away from ash browns.<br>  <br>  Try a Medium Golden brown|`|VigZs9nxaa	I'm thinking a lighter brown maybe a little dirty blond it will make your eyes POP!=]

jvmn7C8Daa	Have you heard of body scarification???<br>  Scarification is a form of body modification in which a design, much like a tattoo, is carved into your body instead of being inked in with a needle...<br>  I have absolutely NO idea where you could find a scarification artist near you, I'm not even sure what they call themselves, but I do know for sure that when the design is all healed it will stand up like braille...here's some pics of body scarification:<br>  <br>  Here's what it looks like freshly done:<br>  <a href="http://newsblaze.com/pix/2008/0506/pix/body-carving123.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://newsblaze.com/pix/2008/0506/pix/b...</a><br>  *NOTE* the red is NOT ink it is bloody flesh, as I said earlier it is a carved design...<br>  <br>  Here's what it should look like when its all healed:<br>  <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1423/669586980_0ee621f513.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1423/6695...</a><br>  <br>  If you would like to see more pics go to google.com, for vids, I would suggest youtube.com<br>  <br>  P.S. The reason that the design is raised is due to the process in which it was put onto the body...it's carved on with a scalpel...the raised skin is scare tissue...<br>  Well hope this helps and good luck :)|`|AA10908609	usually people like us will have a keyloid from gettin the tat itself so if you go in knowin you want black as your color then it may just fade a bit and you'll be the only one that notices cause usually the keyloid is the color of your skin so just in the touch will you know - the guy that did mine was pullin on my skin as he was tattin me so that was obviously gonna be a keyloid area so dont let them do that - most dont they already know|`|hkoI79i2aa	omg why would you want it to keloid??? nonsense.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	Keloids aren't something that can be controlled.

Citric acid from oranges and other citrus fruits also fall under the same classification as glycolic acid.. <br>  <br>  Industrial uses for glycolic acid include rust removal and degreasing, so pure glycolic acid (generally sold in concentrations of 70% or better) is extremely dangerous to exposed skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  You might burn your face according to the amount of alcohol.|`|HylgDXk7aa	its a color translucent crystalline compound <br>  C2 H4O1<br>  it occurs in sugar cane sweet beet and unripe grapes its also used in textiles, dying leather and manufacturing pesticides.|`|8VKRcJmYaa	It worked amazing things for me cleared me right up and I had deep set acne and bad, definetely works!

It took you a long time to grow your hair that long; mid back with layers and of course long wispy bangs would be great.  But then it appears that your young and if you go that short, to your collar bone I mean, then you can always grow your hair long again.  But definitely consider the layers and bangs,,,|`|YMtdlLZgaa	I think you would look really pretty with hair just below your bust and side-swept side bangs!|`|pWwj75oJaa	I agree with de_absta, that style is ROCKIN! <br>  P.S. your wicked photo is awesome!

Start out with it at your bra line and see what you think.  Have long layers put into your hair to add depth.  Your face is oval so you can get away with pretty much anything.  Perhaps add highlight or lowlights if you don't have them.  Have the hairdresser texturize your hair to make shaping easier.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|MyHyLwlsaa	Your face seems a bit long (its probably just the angle) so i would advise bangs, just above your eyes.

a8eac21008987889db2bef8078692713aa	omg, so i used to used head and shoulders shampoo w/ herbal essences conditioner, made my hair frizzy, puffy, and dry. well the puffy was okayy, because it looked volumized. So i changed them, i used dove shampoo for normal hair, and garnier fructis strength and repair conditioner, when i dried it, i used silk drops serum(evenly applied to hair). THen when it was dry, i was like DAMMMN, my hair improved a lot!!!but it got straight, and not really puffy, so i might switch back to head and shoulders, idk, im experimenting for now:D. well, good luck!|`|Rdjq7swEaa	You could search this I forget the name but at the beach my aunt let me borrow this gel thatstraightens dry hair hope I helped

All you need is some eyeshadow and mascara. Don't ever over do it and at your age eyeliner is over doing it.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  Wow I can't believe how many people support young girls to look like tramps. No one under 15 should be wearing much makeup at all. Just simple stuff. No wonder our young girls are so disgusting looking. Its because of people who let their kids get away with things. <br>  PS. I really really hope your mom says no. You don't need it.|`|dM1Ot2APaa	Ok.<br>  Tell them that you wanna wear it and that you won't put so much on that you look like a clown or emo or goth.<br>  <br>  Not that there is anything wrong with goth or emo people it's just parents don't like that sorta stuff.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  I loveee eyeliner.<br>  and i'm 13.;)|`|Uzayv72kaa	just do it. your parents shouldn't be the one telling you how you should dress or if you can wear makeup or not. it's a way for you to express yourself.|`|Xu8FHAQgaa	um, just be like, mom or dad, can I please wear eyeliner on this special occasion for picture day please.|`|I604R4xNaa	Tell them you want to wear it to look good (:|`|1Cc8MyUdaa	put it on before pic day and see if they say anything to you.
dHLEADn0aa	Just print out those pictures and bring them with you. That way you won't miscommunicate what you want and she can see a front and side view. That is a super cute hairstyle, I want something kind of like that too! Once it's done you could definitely straigten it or even scrunch it with gel, that would look cool. If you trust your stylist just ask her what would be best for your hair. It will be great!|`|D2cj05Jdaa	Get the picture<br>  Tell the stylist<br>  He'll or she'll do all the job|`|ZUNmcAmmaa	Just show your stylist the picture.|`|mKhTNsdRaa	After you get the layers and the choppyness put in, get a wax or pomade to get them to stay looking all choppy and sticking out.
JHEeoyONaa	As a girl, I think it's cute having "THUNDER" written across the butt, and if I went to that high school, I'd probably own a pair myself. But you're right, it isn't fair to the guys, because writing on the butt of pants/shorts is more of a girl thing. I think your school should make sweatpants with and without writing on the butt, so students have a choice in the matter. But I guess if you don't like the sweatpants that your school has, then go buy yourself a pair of plain ones.|`|0dyIrY8Gaa	A lot of the girls probably like it, because its kind of a girl thing, but they should definitely give an option that does not say thunder on the butt. for guys it is a little weird but hey, sport your school spirit :D|`|uCsu1VYgaa	You seem so concerned.... genuinely. wow.<br>  My school basically has a non existent dress code. Tube tops have made the odd appearance. That is provocative. Thunder is weak in comparison.|`|opaMeWyIaa	That is pretty weird for a guy. <br>  I have a pair of red short shorts with Colonels on the butt..  But they're from cheerleading.<br>  <br>  I guess just ask the school about it.|`|549htJWVaa	Yeah, i think it is very inappropriate for this to be written.<br>  if it bothers you, wear a long sweatshirt or long shirt/tee over it.|`|4rPQTGiBaa	Well dude first of all thunder ain't so bad! and second It's not that big of a deal your thinking to much about it! just calm down|`|sg0m6LBRaa	yeah.|`|IGQw4267aa	I actually LOL'd.<br>  <br>  lmao. <br>  thunder.<br>  hahaha

Xu8FHAQgaa	For a light completion like you have..Stay natural. I would say to use a light purple or tan/brown eyeshadow to bring out your eyes but without being too over the top. Use a light bronzer to give some color. A peach blush to compliment your cheeks. And a clear gloss. or a light peach like you said to compliment your skin tone. :)|`|a1KT2SQlaa	so you look like amanda bines?<br>  i think anything would look good on you as long as its not to black or too blue (yuck) but any neutral eye colors would be great and any color lips but not to dark and in deep purple but red might be really nice with a light smudged out black eyeliner and black mascara! nice or a smokey brown eye with nude lips

Recent studies have shown that a high fat or higher than average fat diet can contribute to hair loss. The fact that hair is 95% protein backs this up. If your lacking vitamins or proteins in your hair it can effect your hair. the best thing to do to ensure you get the vitamins and minerals you need is to eat a healthy diet.<br>     The other thing you can do is to take hair supplements. These contain all the vitamins, proteins and minerals your hair needs to grow. Good ones also contain DHT blockers which stop the production of DHT which is the root cause of baldness.<br>     If you smoke you should stop or cut right back and if you eat junk food cut it out.<br>      The last thing you should do is to examine your shampoo. The pH of it should be between 5.5 and 8.5 if its not I would change it for a hair loss shampoo to look after your hair.|`|2QbvzEM1aa	Everyone is different, but this website might be able to answer your question better than I can - I know it has worked for a few people I know.

6npsRIzUaa	Uh, no, you shouldn't.<br>  And no, it doesn't need it, it just doesn't.<br>  <br>  Belly button piercings take up to a year to fully heal, more or less depending on each person, don't irritate it by  overkill cleaning and taking it in and out. 4 months is way to soon.|`|c5anDswjaa	Technically you could, but I wouldnt..

If not, wait until it is.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	If it's completely healed, then you can, but since it's only been 4 months I'd wager that it's not.  Wait at least 6 months.  By taking it out you're risking getting bacteria into the piercing site.  If you're really a health freak, then you'd want to do the best thing for your piercing, which is leaving it put until it's fully healed.

A63YNOTjaa	here's how i do it:<br>  close the eye you are putting it on, and keep the other eye open, so you can see.<br>  for the first few times, you'll probably want to get up close to the mirror.<br>  take the eyeliner (pencil usually works best...) and draw a thin/medium sized line all the way around your eye lid, right above your eye lashes.<br>  do the same to both eyes.<br>  for the bottom, it's a bit harder. try looking up, and then put it right underneath the eyelashes, almost on top of them.<br>  good luck, i hope i helped.|`|5fFl7ikIaa	i figured i would put a video to make it easier for you =]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=how+to+put+on+eyeliner&aq=0&oq=how+to+put+on+eye" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_ty...</a>|`|N3qnOlehaa	here's a great vid: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1hc&feature=PlayList&p=93A1DFE3426DB4CE&index=0&playnext=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1...</a><br>  <br>  There are many different kinds, pencil, cream, gel, liquid, and you can even use your eyeshadow as eyeliner.<br>  <br>  There are also many ways of applying it, but a common way is with an angled brush like this: <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp.tmpl?" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....</a><br>  <br>  There's also pencil eyeliner and liquid eyeliner. Pencil's are easier, and i use that kind most often. Liquid eyeliner is for more experienced makeup users (which is why i don't use it, lol). Some great liquid liners are from urban decay, maybelline, loreal, all kinds of brands. I really like the pencil eyeliners from urban decay too. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-D|`|BAXwTEAvaa	Use a pencil for a beginner. <br>  make sure its nice and sharp<br>  stretch out the corner of your eye<br>  and draw a straight line from corner to corner<br>  if you mess up don't worry you can always<br>  re due it :) good luck and remember practice makes perfect!|`|BThdUonXaa	top eyelid: brown liquid  eyeliner. starting a little bit after the inside of my eye and going to the end.<br>  bottom eyelid: same as above except brown pencil.|`|t1VXsGpwaa	With pencil. It is the best by far. Just draw a line with it right on top of your eyelash line.
zahwGJh5aa	Your hair won't grow slower however, if you use lots of thermal heat products on your hair without any type of thermal protectorate then your hair WILL break off on the ends. Therefore my suggestion would be to use brilliant damage control by Aveda, Chi silk infusion, or any other protector for thermal heat that will protect your hair from the ends to the root. Wash your hair at least once a week if its dry and brittle. And at least once every 3 days if its oily. <br>  <br>  Try to take really good care of your hair.|`|cTkqCAceaa	no. hair grows out of your roots. if you use heat or get split ends, the roots dont all of the sudden stop growing. no split ends just looks nice and tidy.|`|sraO6ilsaa	No it doesnt. but too much heat on your hair can give you split ends. and when the split ends break off, it looks like your hair isnt growing but it is. its just splittling at the ends|`|0JuLhrwdaa	yes and no..if you mean heat as in heat in the air then no your hair should grow normally but if your meaning using straightning and curling irons then yes it will slow down your hair growth because it makes more split ends which slows down you hair growth..i suggest using a heat taming spray( i use tressemme heat taming spray) so when i straighten my hair it doesnt get damaged. hope i helped!|`|sOO93u5Oaa	If you mean in the weather, yes, the sun can damage your hair and cause it to grow slower, and less healthy.<br>  <br>  If you mean product wise (hair dryers, curling irons, hair straighteners), yes, they damage your hair, too.|`|JtPu0KBXaa	No.|`|imjVCrMgaa	i think yes if you put heat on your hair every day and dont wash and condition it because it would start pulling your hair out but other than that your hair shouldnt come out.
z3uUtr33aa	i have very thick hair too and when i get kinky twists it's full but it's not too much. i usually perm my hair before i get it done or i straighten it trying to make it as flat as possible. i've been through roller coasters with my hair and i've found that just keeping micros or kinky twists is what works best and it really helps my hair grow. good luck!<br>  <br>  -tasha
O3FnYRe6aa	I used it before and it works for awhile, It didn't fry my hair..however, it did come out after going in the pool!|`|oAkGBiobaa	i hav dyed my friends hair with the bright pink color and it barely showed up in her light blonde hair. All it left was a hint of color. Remember the dye may be cheap, but more often than not, u get what u pay for.<br>  good luck!|`|NOz2NIMTaa	OMG! That stuff works like sh*t! You should go buy Manic Panic or Special Effects USA. The dye comes out within 3-4 days even with bleach!|`|mKhTNsdRaa	Sommer Amber is right. Special Effects and Manic Panic are the best brands to buy. Stay away from hottopic hair color.
oQnlIr88aa	are you sure that giving her something to shink her pores is really a good idea? its not going to give the wrong impression?
oQnlIr88aa	lots of squats, another is...<br>  lay on your sid and place the leg on top over the other one (foot on the ground) then quickly raise and lower the other leg. do it as long as you can then do the other side. if that doesnt make since ill try to explain again|`|CKpxVeucaa	okay one week is not enough time. Sorry.|`|DdYxu5Jqaa	eat eggs and do squats<br>  trust me<br>  trust me...<br>  <br>  <br>  >:D|`|ArFFUPTBaa	i agree with the 1st person (:|`|JsNG9IIDaa	I'm in dance and what i find gives me really toned looking thighs/legs/body is this:<br>  <br>  1. 5 minutes of crunches trying to keep your stomach in the whole time (this willmake your stomach look more toned as apposed to buldgy)<br>  <br>  2. Stretch one leg out to the side (holding stomach in and the other standing) and left it up to the side really thinking of pulling your knee caps up to keep your leg straight. Hold until you feel cramping then release and stretch it out<br>  <br>  3. Lie on your back with knees bent and push your but up and squeeze and hold (sounds silly but works for the back part of your legs and butt) then try lifting on of the legs out straight still holding the position and then switch<br>  <br>  If you do these things 2 or more times everyday you'll be in great shape :) hope this helps<br>  <br>  <br>  PS.

Idk how your gonna do that! just exercise daily try bumping up your leg exercise but remember to stretch!|`|DvKpx0Reaa	1 week is too little to make a significant, HEALTHY difference|`|6M2ikJfkaa	Hahaha your "thys."<br>  <br>  Anyway...use an abductor/adductor machine, or google "abductor/adductor exercises" as well as "quad exercises."

aQT37RaKaa	Grey hair at a young age means your under stress. Trying relaxing more and/or stop doing things that cause you stress.|`|rzqpd9uEaa	that's normal just dye it or you could get highlights
f2mokGcIaa	I really love those! I think what I like best is the pop of neon yellow so I would pair it with something that has a similar shade of yellow so that it would pick up on that. So there are two options neon yellow tee (but with a cardigan or zip up jacket so that its not necessarily too overwhelmingly neon). Also since the shoes arn't all that busy so don't be afraid to wear something with a print (my favourites are anything from kidrobot, BBC, or alife - they are always good for a kick of color)|`|0dyIrY8Gaa	those are some sick kicks!<br>  just wear like an all black shirt or one with some/one of those colors in it. <br>  or do you want me to shop around? i could look for some shirts and give you the links..|`|pQKgJ5Woaa	i love your shoes!<br>  black tees with a yellow or pink picture on it would work.<br>  or maybe something like that? <br>  the colors could be different shades.|`|eoLYNoAYaa	i think a hot pink shirt. that would be sweet. those shoes are killer though. :)

Y64OGuTIaa	Girls can pull off guy stuff.<br>  its just a fact :)<br>  And you can look juust as straight with them.|`|xnd99EX4aa	Why else would a man wear a womans clothes?|`|lrJQxohVaa	girls have slimmer bodys and curves andboobs which guys do that.|`|LKyGCaFQaa	I own 2 pairs of girls jeans 1 Vigoss, and 1 Angel and people dont seem to notice or care.  Those who know me know I am straight and dont have a problem with it, and those who dont know me I dont care what they think.  Clothes are clothes and people who jump to the "gay" thing based off clothes need hit with an unabridged medical dictionary.|`|turUISSfaa	you have to forget that kinds of thinks, those are stupid and you will waste your time if you put attention to that.<br>  Gay is a man that likes to stay with another gay, that′s all!, and a lesbian is a girl that she likes to stay with another lesbian.|`|pQKgJ5Woaa	girls aren't gay when they were men's clothes. who would think that?|`|zahwGJh5aa	A woman in man's clothes is harder to judge than a man in woman's clothing. People wouldn't even think I'm not gay if I wear my husband t-shirt & jeans. But then again, I'm an ultra-fem (make-up hair & all) and my measurements are 36-27-40, so I have curves. But any man in a dress will definitely make you go hmmm<br>  A woman can wear man's jeans. Hey, they're even called "Boyfriend Jeans". But a man in woman's jeans... "Girlfriend Jeans" even sounds a bit gay, don't ya think?  <br>  All in all, it's not what you wear, but it's how you wear it. let's forget the dress. If you are ultra fem in woman's t-shirt & jeans clothing but you're a man, you would probably be perceived as a gay. Just like if your demeanor was ultra masculine and you were wearing man's clothing but you are a woman, same thing. <br>  So.... I think it's not really what you wear, it's how you wear it. (Unless, of course, you're a man wearing a dress)|`|88JCKhJkaa	some guys think its sexy when girls wear guy clothes, depending on what they wear.. like just a shirt with no pants.<br>  but if girls wear guy clothes theyre usually tomboys and mostlikely gonna become butch lesbians.<br>  justttt my opinion|`|eW78c00Daa	okay

eow59EaEaa	I'm pretty sure for her TV appearances Tyra's makeup artist uses a professional foundation like RCMA, Cinema Secrets, Visoria, etc.<br>  <br>  And I know for a fact she has 2-3 different colors on her face. A highlighting color in a medium yellow-y color used on her cheeks, the bridge of her nose and possibly the center of her forehead. Another for her chin, the rest of her forehead and the side of her face and a contour color.|`|Lmh3ybBTaa	They eat lots of bananas.... trust me LOOOOTTSSS!! And cucumbers. Anything big, thick, and long that takes a long time to eat.|`|JcUCMqVJaa	they probably get airbrushed and when i saw tyra banks in LA at her show taping..she looks super normal..not flawless like she appears to be on ANTM or red carpet events

AITKiXwUaa	I'm actually in the same situation.  Stripping is really hard on your hair, so I'm just washing mine a lot with Head and Shoulders shampoo, and clarifying shampoo.  They both help fade it a lot, and I'm almost back to blond after two weeks of washing.  It'll take longer than stripping, and the color will look strange while its fading, but your hair will be healthier in the long run.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	My daughter had it done and didn't complain. But it's horribly hard on your hair. Ask your stylist for Pravana stripper. It's the best and won't harm your hair like the usual stuff.|`|PTydjBFHaa	if there is any pain its temporary and totally worth it if thats what you want to do|`|2Q1QpFL7aa	If done by a good beautician, you may feel a slight tingling all over your head, or nothing at all. If someone does it wrong (the chemicals) or leaves it on your head to much, you will feel like your head is on fire. Worst case scenario, your hair will fall off (not likely) It burns a bit but not much. If you feel burning (a lot) let the person doing your hair know! Don't be scared, just go somewhere were its not to shady. Black is a hard color to get stripped, but not impossible. Some people experience dryness on there scalp.|`|2eFIzND0aa	no. and that is a way of keeping your hair healthy.

JfOuzOJGaa	Is this for your face or body?<br>  <br>  I use Lubriderm for my body, but if this is for your face, then I'd look into moisturizers made specifically for the face.  Cetaphil is an excellent skin care brand.
pa7YF9Vxaa	chep pencil eyeliner from the $1 store|`|ZNuMrSPYaa	Everyones eyes work differently but what worked for me has been HIP PENCIL LINER and also URBAN DECAY 24 7 Liner..<br>  What will really help is if you set your liner with a powder (just as we set our liquid foundation with a powder) If you use a black liner, take a eyeliner brush and apply a black eyeshadow over the liner, this will help it stay in place!!!|`|8484b98b7322a891688e78db30e42f20aa	I've been using Artistry's control eyeliner and their essentials mascara together for several years now, and they are absolutely bloody AMAZING! For me, they've worked better than other's I've tried, primarily MAC and Urvan Decay 24/7, since it hardly ever flakes and doesn't run in the least. Plus, it lasts a long time, so I hardly ever have to reapply during the day, so that's always a plus in my book. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I usually buy directly from the website (pasted below), since it's cheaper than from stores, I believe. I wholly recommend the eyeliner and mascara.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, mate! ^_^|`|OVU60dQWaa	I'm not sure about eyelinner but Maybelline Colossall mascara is the BEST!!!!! it makes your eyelashes fuller n  longerr!!! I use it n i love it|`|ZzveN6B3aa	Revlon Colorstay or Almay|`|YRLpuXziaa	I have that same problem, I used to have raccoon eyes by noon and I just hated it! <br>  <br>  But recently, I've switched from pencil to cream liner. I use the L'Oreal HIP cream eyeliner and it really lasts all day, unless you rub your eyes like crazy. The colors are intense and beautiful and the lasting power is great. It also comes with a small brush so you don't have to invest in one of your own.<br>  <br>  Also, try using a eyeshadow base/primer because they help keep eye makeup from moving/creasing.<br>  <br>  As for mascaras, each one is different for everyone because it all depends on your lashes. But lately, I've tried Maybelline Colossal and it's pretty decent.

ux7Wgh6Gaa	Go for it!  I'm 5'10'' too, and I love heels.  If you feel uncomfortable towering over people, then don't.  But it sounds like you feel better in heels than out of them, so as long as they're appropriate for the situation and match your outfit, why not?  I have a friend who's 5'1'', and she's always asking why I where heels.  Because I can!  Show off your style, and if your friends criticize your height, they're not really your friends.

That's what I see a lot of girls wearing and it looks great (in my opinion).<br>  <br>  <br>  and I guess I go with just passing in the halls.  It would put her in my head and then I would be thinking of tons of stuff to talk to her about later.

If you need more tips go to a local salon, or look in magazines. Good luck!|`|ffb25b1afc44dcb5725bbd67424a36fcaa	thats a cute cut i have had it before. i took this texturizer stuff and flipped my hair and ran my hands through it and made it all surfer beachy like. its call Surf Hair from Garnier Fructis. also, crinkle it like that other girl said. good idea! i did that when i had my hair like that. short hair doesn't have to be punky, make it either really straight or a cool realxed wavy feel. dove has some good products that make ur hair soft, and the surf hair rox. make it wavy, not curly. its relaxed and cute. try it. Hope this helps.
9tLmtrp9aa	Hello there, <br>  <br>  There are three really important things you can do immediately to help stop breakouts with out dishing out allot of money.<br>  <br>  1. Exercise, this helps you sweat and exfoliate your skin. Remember when you exercise the more you sweat the more your are doing for your skin. It makes no sense to exercise and not sweat hard.<br>  <br>  2.Watch what your eating,( i.e. sweets, sodas) something in your food could possibly be the cause of your breakouts. Also stress has been linked to cause breakouts too.<br>  <br>  3. Take a visit to your dermatologist about prescribing you some medication.<br>  <br>  4. Find a really good Anti-bacterial soap. I use Neem soap. It's very good on the skin, fights the bacteria thats deep in your pores, and leaves it feeling really clean and glowing. This is a good site to find it ...Ethnic Foods Company<br>  <br>  After you've done these really effective things you can go purchase Aloe Vera Leaf. Its natural, fresh and cost no more than $2 bucks. You can find the m at your local farmers market or Publix. If you cut it open and apply it to your skin it has anti-inflammatory properties that will help heal your skin very quickly, and minimize the appearance of dark spots. Trust me out of all of the medication I've tried, this is the only thing that I swear by. Its cheap and it actually works. Try this first before you go buying any spot medication, they are usually just gimmicks and people waste allot of money on them every year.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	You need to use more specific nouns.  Pronouns make things confusing here.  "I'm afraid he will tell him that my skin is REALLY bad."  He and him who?  You're afraid your dad will tell your doctor your skin is bad or you're afraid your doctor will tell your dad your skin is bad?  Either way, if whatever over the counter things you're trying aren't working and it's really affecting your confidence that badly, then wouldn't you want to see a doctor to seek further, hopefully more successful treatment?
JTjL9eD7aa	I once went through 6 CHIs in less than two years between my mother and I, which is insane, because we both take VERY good care of such things. CHI does a great job straightening and curling, however, it is not durable. From cords fraying for no reason to fuses blowing out of the blue, CHIs have proven overpriced to me. One flat iron that works just as well and is half the price is Solia, which is sold at Folica.com. They are $80-$90 and I recommend the 1" iron. DON'T BUY A CHI! Like I said, they do work well, but you can get the same results for half the price and, Solia's flat irons have lasted me up to 2 years... not 2 months like CHI. I've always been told that I have gorgeous hair, and it's usually straight... I will never buy anything but Solia again.|`|jyb0x1rsaa	<a href="http://www.sfrproducts.net/le-angelique-pro-hair-straightener.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfrproducts.net/le-angelique-...</a><br>  <br>  best straightner ever|`|0zBp2lMeaa	i have never had a chi Straightener but i did have a blow dryer and it lasted me a long time. however i heard the Straighteners are not very good i am a hair dresser so i use my flat iron A Lot and i have tryed sooo many different kinds i love the one i have now is a  bab aless <br>  that not how its spell but how u say it hope this helps|`|jxshK9mnaa	I'm using Chi straighterner for over a year now, using the same one, it's still good as new.

No. Are your grades? Yes. Stop whining over the hair and get busy on your grades. You are not impressing your parents with your priorities and continuing to act that way will get you no where with them.|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	You should probably cut it and not dye it.<br>  Not many guys can pull off really long hair.<br>  And purple... that's the gay color.

GptPmbHfaa	I think a pinky ring is cool, but too many rings can give the wrong impression of who you are, and just looks bad (girls or guys). I know this jeweler guy who wears this mass of chunky, mismatched bracelets on both hands, it looks terrible, and you cant help but think "whats the deal with this guy" when you see him. I wouldnt go with a thumb ring cuz you use your thumb so much, so the ring would have to be a good fit. Wear them on your non dominant hand, so they will not get in the way. So maybe a pinky ring on one hand and one on the index finger. I have heard no more than 3 rings on one hand is a good rule. If you really want to go crazy you can get a small ring and wear it "Egyptian style" , which is the middle part of your finger between the first and second knuckle.  When buying a ring, price doesnt really matter to me so long as it is precious.  You can get a silver and semiprecious stone (like turquoise) ring for pretty cheap, but the materials that it is made with will not lose value after you buy it because they have intrinsic value.|`|OFhom4pEaa	I've seen rings on guys from all walks of life.<br>  If you like them, go ahead and try them out.|`|bJKeFNsVaa	Yep :) A little bit of jewelry can be nice for everyone regardless of gender. I'm not sure which hand though.|`|te3vxV0haa	Rings are cool, I think.<br>  It doesn't matter what hand or finger though, seriously. Seems that a lot of guys prefer middle finger...haha.<br>  <br>  But yeah, go for it, they're awesome.|`|KNaqn7Tdaa	Rings are pieces of metal.  To paraphrase Shakespeare, there's nothing cool or uncool about them but thinking makes it so.  But sure, like most things, some people think they're cool.  Some people don't.<br>  If you like them, and feel like they help you with some aspect of self esteem, go for it, but in the end, realize that anything we put on or adopt to present ourselves to the outside world is just for show.  In the end, the only thing that makes you what you want to be is you, the way you think, behave, speak, etc. Putting on appearances is a part of everyone's life.  Do what makes you happy and what helps you figure out who you are, but I can guarantee, who you are has nothing to do with metal circles.
WHqcYk27aa	hair growing back thicker and/ or darker is just a myth.

It was a royal pain the butt. First the doctor wouldn't proscribe me Emla cream because he thought I was going to shoot up drugs...WTF? Then you have to leave it on for 40 minutes to numb the area. Then the technician would use this hair thin needle and stick it into ever single hair follicle. Its a time consuming process and costs lots of money. And it takes awhile to see any results because the hair grows in cycles. Not worth it. Just stick to waxing in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Electrolysis sucks!
c5anDswjaa	Oh.. All these people saying piercings are sleezy and stuff are ding dongs, piercings arent slutty PEOPLE are.. Neither piercing means that youre nasty, and plenty of people are attracted to both..<br>  <br>  Id go for the nips! I got mine done and yeah they hurt like hades (about 5 seconds for each one) but I absolutely LOVE them.. The way they look, and how they make me feel, like I have a secret lol.. The only male that has ever seen them is my boyfriend, I dont go showing off my **** to everyone.. I got them done last July and theyre still healing, but its not too big of an annoyance.. <br>  <br>  Im not a big fan of tongue rings simply because they can damage your teeth and gums.. Id probably get one if it wasnt for that..<br>  <br>   But get whichever you want, Im sure youll enjoy either!|`|Op37pHd3aa	well they both are a risky place to pierce but if i had to choose i'd do tongue. :]|`|X2bxkU2paa	Tongue.<br>  <br>  Nipple piercings are the 2nd most painful piercing you can get (septum being the 1st) and they take forever to heal, during which time you're constantly pampering your nips because any little contact with them hurts like hell.<br>  <br>  Nip piercings also turn me off; most guys feel the same way.  Most of us prefer women's bodies to be natural, not all tatted and pierced; that makes me associate the girl with disease and being dirty, can't really explain why, but it does.  Maybe because it fits the bill with being a junkie or a stripper, which is a prejudicial stereotype, but nonetheless, how many people perceive it.<br>  <br>  A tongue piercing isn't as noticeable and is to me, in a way, kind of cute and sexy on a girl.  And honestly, it hurts less than getting your ear pierced, much less your nipples, lol.  Just try not to bite your tongue when it swells up for a few days afterwords - that kind of hurts.|`|Crdbwmo7aa	i  had my nose done twice in the same spot.. both times hurt like hell. i got my tongue pierced bout 2 weeks ago. it didnt hurt AT ALL. the only time it hurt was because i was playin with it and accidently bit it. lol. mine doesnt hurt at all, the swelling is gone and i have already changed the barbell. it did make my tongue feel like it was peeling and that was a bit annoying but that is bout it. i dont no bout nipple piercings. not gettin one either. a friends got infected and she has like half a boob now. if that.|`|jUuYMVqiaa	i would do both! im more of a fan of nipple piercings though, because they are a more private thing to share with you and your boyfriend, and honestly i think a girl is sleezy when she has a tounge piercing, dunno why but i just do.<br>  the pain is worth it and it doesnt take too long to heal, about the same as your nose. (couple months)|`|Zw7IVfqeaa	Nipple piercing can take up to a year to heal. Also, you may lose sensation in your nipple and/or look like you're 'nipped' all the time. <br>  <br>  Tongue piercing is less painful than ear piercings and takes only a few weeks to heal.
154dzJ1Faa	There are many women that opted to open a business in their home.  They may have had small children, or only wanted to work fewer hours.  <br>  <br>  But you need to look into your local laws.  Many cities do not allow a business to be operated from the home.  There are health regulations in regards to doing hair, and you need to know what they are. (cannot prepare food in the same area, or serve food in the "shop")  Some cities require you to have a separate entrance, cannot be connected to the rest of the home, you need a special business licence, etc.  There are a lot of rules, so be sure to check all of them before you end up paying a huge fine, and being shut down, or losing your license altogether.  And if you are at home, many "customers" expect you to charge less, and to work at any hour of the day or night.  It's not going to be easy doing it from home.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	1st answerer said it all!<br>  good advice|`|GKSlikxJaa	just put it in a ponytail maybe some hairspray with glitter??

eqxrSzNgaa	I think that if you really like it, you should get it no matter what. If you are not sure then it is really good to get opinions!!! Ok, well, I think that if you go to the barber wanting this, you should print a picture that shows his head and hair so the barber will be able to use it as a guide if they need to. If you feel embarressed about doing that, just get the name of it from a friend. Ask what it is while you watching wrestling. It will seem just like a casual question. So, I guess im done. <br>         Ps- Hope the barber makes it look good;<br>         PSS- Hope its cool.....

rgNP0Qo6aa	Sounds like it's perfect for you!!!<br>  I've already lost a lot of hair under my arms after 2 treatments, my next one is friday =)<br>  <br>  Okay... science answer:<br>  <br>  You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.<br>  <br>  Okay... Personal Experience:<br>  <br>  I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.<br>  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:<br>  Bikini-$750<br>  Underarms-$750<br>  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions about it!|`|nS83ag9raa	i hope you have a lot of money...<br>  <br>  and i also hope you have a lot of patience..<br>  <br>  because it take a great deal of both|`|JITTMjasaa	It depends where you go but it does last longer than shaving. They have a machine that is connected to tweezer like things that zap the hair off. The higher they make the setting, the longer it takes the hair to grow back but it hurts more. It costs a lot to get it done and they like to set it on low so you keep coming back. Just try to go to an honest, respectable, well known place and you should be fine.|`|RfxyVIh4aa	I'm going through this right now.  I've had three treatments so far and am not seeing any results yet.  (I was told you need at least six treatments.)<br>  <br>  Essentially, you shave the day before your session.  The actual device is like a small suction cup that delivers a mild electrical zap.  It's not bad.  It's alot less painful than waxing.|`|bvnSjdmeaa	i got it on my stomach and legs and under arms. It WORKS!!!!!!!!! grow your hair long and then shave it about 1-2 hrs before you get laser treatment. it will take about 2-3 times to completely go away.  It is amazing!!!!!! congrats on getting it you will love not shaving!!!!|`|ss1JDUVraa	check online websites for info, or call into centers near you.<br>  good luck!|`|qL8NaVcMaa	I have pale skin and light hair and I've had it both underarms and bikini. I found that it worked great for the bikini area, I haven't had a touch-up in years and still have hardly any hair. The underarms though, after 5 treatments I never saw any real difference. <br>  One thing to keep in mind with laser hair removal is that it isn't permanent hair removal, its more like permanent reduction, and if you keep getting touch-ups every 6 months or so you'll be pretty much hair free. But since you're looking at such a small area, it might be more cost effective to get electrolysis which is permanent. I've only ever had one treatment of that in a small area on my leg, it never came back. It does cost more per session, but it's permanent. As for pain, I'd say they hurt about the same, but eletrolysis takes longer.|`|lISrOzyraa	hmmm I don't know but, if you go get lazered then let me know how it goes. I tried waxing but that hurt like hec and shaving sucks! lol! i do not want to get burnt! one of my friends had her face lazered she said she only goes once every 3 years for an update, i figure that's how it would work if you had your under arms.|`|05c9418f68c17ff6c60b3fa26378f40caa	i have a friend who had it done<br>  it took about 3 treatments but it worked for her|`|D9iE2JBKaa	why
jUuYMVqiaa	its not the worst on pain but its gonna hurt a little, really it depends on your pain tolerance.<br>  and i have also heard that it can either increase or even decrease sensitivity. and they tend to show through clothing because your nipples will basically always be "on stand" lol.<br>  however personally i think its a very sensual piercing and would heighten a sexual experience, but i have a thing for piercings sooooo.<br>  <br>  but i deff think its worth it.|`|8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	As I guy, I can only comment upon what I find attractive regarding piercings on a lady.  Piercings on the ears and the navel are particularly appealing to me.  But piercings on the nipples?  Can't say I've ever been particularly fond of them.  Like tattoos, of which I have a few, such things will either turn others off or on.  To each their own.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|et5mUW4oaa	i have a prince albert, it was etremely painful|`|p9r6sKx2aa	Thats just gross...dont do it!|`|X2bxkU2paa	Its the 2nd most excruciatingly painful piercing you can get.  The only thing that hurts worse is a bull ring (septum).<br>  <br>  And I'm talking about traditional areas of the body that people get pierced by the way.  Obviously getting your eyeball pierced, or something like that, would hurt a hell of a lot more.|`|CyJUFQCSaa	I have mine pierced, it hurts quite a bit, I'm a guy and can say that my female friends with them done have said it didn't hurt bad.

Now that I have them, I wouldn't have done it if I knew what I would go through.<br>  I'm not saying I hate them, I'm saying they weren't worth it.<br>  <br>  It could be different for you.<br>  <br>  *Edit:<br>  I notice people are saying it's a turn off...but there are guys/girls that I know that find it very sexy. But it's not for everyone. For me piercings and tattoos are very, very hot to me.|`|nCFnFLCDaa	Totally not worth the pain. It's a big turn off!|`|aBJGNnCFaa	wow i really doubt its worth it.......

ZkrGttKaaa	Weeell, I suppose that depends on what constitutes judgment. If first impressions can be fair in regard to tattooed people, I think I've got a pretty good handle on it. Example: When I see a guy with a teardrop under his eye, sporting a shamrock with three sixes in it, along with dual lightning bolts on the side of his shaved head, it's safe for me to assume he's a racist. When I see a koifish, and plum trees on a beautiful woman dressed to the nines, sporting a husband with like Japanese art, coming out of a dinner theater, getting into a vintage '68 Corvette, I assume that they're in love, and that he makes a very good living. And when I see a side of beef with USMC on his left bicep and a close cropped haircut, I say, 'soldier'. Tattoos can tell a lot about who you are. The rest of your appearance tells me more. Am I a 'tattoo bigot?' But I get your point. (Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.) Take care.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	I don't judge people based on whether or not they have tattoos.  I do tend to judge people based on their tattoos though.  If you're some bro with crappy "tribal" tats, then most likely I don't want anything to do with you.  I think I have better judgment and taste than people with poor quality tattoos and I don't believe in any god, so in my eyes, we aren't all the same.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	I kind of envy people who have tattoos. I would love to get one, but I'm scared I'll regret it later. I don't really like it when people get huge tattoos of weird and meaningless things, but when you have a tattoo, big or small, that's symbolic and represents something important to you, I think that's awesome.|`|Ql6qFk85aa	Only if it looks like gang ink or if it's a really tacky image.

I didnt pay for it, so i sure as hell wont get mad.|`|IS1F69mraa	Since I am tattooed myself, I would never look down upon those that are tattooed (unless they have really really crappy work LOL).

There are a few people who just think it looks bad, but the majority of them base their hate on their god. <br>  <br>  I can't remember exactly where (I don't practice christianity anymore) but there's a passage in the bible that says we are not to mark ourselves or pierce ourselves in mourning. Basically saying that tattooing yourself is a sin. So, religious people look at those of us who like a little color on our skin and think to themselves, wow what a godless heathen! <br>  <br>  Fortunately not all religious people think that way, and there are many out there who are kind and accepting of tattoos and the people who wear them. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against religion or the people who follow it, it's just not for me. But, I still have friends who regularly go to church, accept me for who I am, love their lord and savior, and not only love my tattoos but have a few of their own.|`|FiOaEFuOaa	i treat them the same as any other person cuz my mom has like a lot of tatoos she has a rose with spines and has juarez with a skull in her arm, a rose in her thigh, a LOVE in her 4 main fingers and her name in the other side of her neck<br>  so thats why i now respect people with tatoos|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I judge people on their actions|`|AX13vUJeaa	uh. hell to the NO

If you're like me, you have **** skin if you don't wash it everyday. And if you're not like me, well you're lucky. So basically just go to the drug store, walmart, etc and pick up a face wash. Neutragena works for me, but every one is different so I can't just tell you that a certain brand will work for you. Use it for a few weeks and if it's not working switch over to another until you find one that works really well for you. Obviously you wont see results instantly, so be patient.<br>  <br>  For make up, get a concealer (green to cover any pimples, it takes the red out of it) and one that's a bit lighter than your skin to cover under eye circles :) Then just get a cover up (I prefer liquid, but you can also get powder, which ever)<br>  If you don't want to use either of those, of course you don't have to. I mean Just thinking until you get your skin cleared up and for any small breakouts you may have after that :) But don't use A LOT of make up all of the time while your trying to get your skin all cleared up, because it'll take longer obviously since it clogs pores.<br>  For your eyes just use a bit of mascara on the top and bottom lashes. If you'd like your eyes to look bigger you can use a bit of white eyeliner on your water line (the bit of skin that's like right above your lower lash line) Maybe use some clear lip gloss on dates and stuff too :)<br>  <br>  And for nice hair, get frequent trims first of all. Like at least a trim every month to cut off your split ends. Then go to sally's or somewhere else and pick up a hair reconstructer or hot oil treatment for your hair<br>  Use that like once a week and it will really moisturizer your hair :)|`|YSGKWjqsaa	for the makeup:<br>  go to sephorahs and ask them to give you a makeover. they teach how to put the makeup on and show the colors that look good on your skin.<br>  for a clear complexion:<br>   drink LOTS of water. it hydrates the skin and clears up blotchy skin. also if you have pimples, use proactive or something. also dont eat a lot of fried or fatty foods, you dont have to completely give them up, just dont eat them alot. also foundation and cover up will do good.<br>  for the hair:<br>  go to a hair salon and ask how to do your hair...they will show you how to too. just dont go to super cuts.<br>  hope this helps.<br>  a picture of you could help to..
jUuYMVqiaa	what we do today affects what we look like when were older, so i think any preventive methods are ok.<br>  heck i used anti aging lotion when i was 14, and i have nice skin so obviously it didnt do me any harm. keeps my skin looking young.|`|2JW4qsRAaa	No I wouldnt say so.<br>  I dont think it can have a reverse affect either.<br>  Though as you grow older it might stop working im assuming..<br>  <br>  I use anti -wrinkle cream.<br>  It makes my skin smooth and keeps it from getting uneaven skin tones during the summer!<br>  <br>  Im only 15 and I use it so i wouldnt think it would be too early to use this...!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ZzveN6B3aa	I'm 22 and I use the ani-wrinkle products.

dIS08i1oaa	First, if it says "10k" inside the shank, this means it is 10 karat white gold, not silver.  The letters "THL" are the hallmark of the manufacturer.<br>  <br>  Second, if she wants to sell it, it is difficult to sell jewelry to retail stores these days.  For the most part, they already have too much inventory.  You might try eBay if you want to sell it.<br>  <br>  How much is it worth?  Hard to say because I can't see the ring.  Here is a very common style of diamond ring with 11 diamonds in it, that sells for about $300:|`|l8yfpyy1aa	First take it to a jewelry store and find out if the stones are really diamonds.  They could be cubic zirconia or synthetic white sapphires.  The silver color is probably white gold, to judge by the "10K" stamp inside, which means 10-karat (5/12ths gold alloy).  I don't know what the "THL" means, but the store might know.  It could be the manufacturer's logo.  The jewelry store probably won't be able to give you a value for it, but they can at least identify the metal and the stones, and advise you where to actually get it appraised (if it's going to be worth it).<br>  <br>  The total weight of eleven small stones is worth much less than an equal weight all in one stone would be.<br>  <br>  The retail markup of jewelry is very high, so if she wants to sell it, she can't expect more than about a third of the price originally paid for the ring in a jewelry store.|`|3dbZdwGLaa	i'd be easies to take it to a jewerly store/ antique stor<br>  then they would be able to examin it<br>  it's gonna hard to tell , even for jwelers on answers, cuz u dont have a pic and u need proper tools( i think)<br>  also she should know cuz she bought the ring|`|BAXwTEAvaa	Alot!

2Q1QpFL7aa	Most likely they will return it to your credit card the whole amount you are returning. If you are going in store, then that is how they will do it. If your doing it through the mail, at the bottom of your receipt is a return slip and that is how you return it. I am not sure how they process returns online.
154dzJ1Faa	No, of course not.  No shampoo can promise you lots of volume!  And if you listen carefully, they don't say that.  They can't.  It's illegal.  But they can say things that make YOU put words into theirs, and then you believe it will make volume.<br>  <br>  Hair that is clean will have volume.  You are leaving a film on the hair, which makes it heavy and limp.  You need to use a good plain simple shampoo that cleans your hair, and nothing else.  Infusium is not what you need at this point.<br>  <br>  If your hair is too long, it is going to be limp and flat.  Something shorter will have some lift and bounce.  How much depends on how soft it is.<br>  <br>  You should be setting your hair on rollers for lift.  Large rollers will work best.  Use some styling aids (mousse, setting lotions) to give some added bulk and stiffness.  You can use hot rollers too, but they don't work quite as well.<br>  <br>  A shampoo is only meant to clean your hair, nothing more.  Don't expect miracles from shampoo -- despite the advertising.

ddXQeEvNaa	Just use a curling iron, wrap your hair around it, and instead of unclamping it and letting your hair loose; wiggle out the barrel and clip the curl like hers. Before each curl cools down, spray it lightly with hairspray. <br>  <br>  <br>  It isn't really good for creating tight curls, it's better for big beachy waves.|`|hhW4j8PCaa	She has rollers in her hair|`|bCqYJ7Hsaa	there rolling it in a curling iron and pinning it up with butterfly clips.|`|GKSlikxJaa	man thats like mission impossible sorry cant help!

That breaks more blood vessels. Dab it on gently in a circular motion towards the inside corner of the eye.<br>  *Sometimes wearing a nightmask to bed over the cream helps<br>  <br>  Make sure you're doing all the obvious things- get enough sleep and plenty of fluid.<br>  And a good concealer is always handy!
dM1jwSGyaa	DON'T GO TO A TANNING BED.<br>  It's just as bad as baking in the sun for hours and hours without sunscreen - in fact, sometimes it's worse.

xK5lWU3qaa	People have a tendency to pull off blondes well only if they have been blonde at some point in their lives. As for how light to go? The same theory applies here. Your hair will look the most natural if you tint it only as light as the lightest color you have ever been naturally.<br>  <br>  This works because of skintones. The only real exception is that it tends to look pretty pathetic for 30-somethings to be platinum blonde, even if they were platinum blonde 25 years earlier.|`|uQWKSQMzaa	OK, go for it.|`|ArFFUPTBaa	lol then why ask if ur not postin a pic?|`|Kswn0Aqcaa	Don't dye it before your birthday.

QVWcnIIqaa	Erm... hard to discern without pictures. Pink may work. You could also try a greenish-blue, or a grey-blue, or even a really pale blue. I would suggest blue to bring out your eyes. Try something not too fancy, perhaps something with straps. Show off your legs, look for something with an angle. Don't get floor length. Um... probably want something long and flowy. Try something that ties around the neck, or something that tightens around the waist to help with the flat-chested problem. Show off your arms if you feel comfortable doing that. Find something comfortable that fits nice. I definitely suggest blue.|`|8g3Uz6PCaa	ok so i think pink would be ur color like u said, u might also want to get a dress thats short but not to short to show off ur legs. hope i helped.
S9LqkU01aa	i went to spain in august 07 for 28 days it was friggin sweet. You will most likely get really tan if u are on the beach every day for a good amount of time. i came back and i was SO TAN i know i was there for many days more then you will be but, we went to the beach but not for long maybe like an hour cuz i was onyl 15 and me and my other 2 girlfriends were only 15 aswell, no parents.... so we would get ADD and want to leave lol.....but if you put tanning oil on of an sort you will defiantly get tan just lay out for a good amount of time each day. just be careful the first day cuz the sun is very strong there believe it or not. enjoy im jealous i want to go again! hope i helped you out! xo|`|rGci1ehoaa	i would recommend getting a little base tan before you go.. visit a tanning salon 2 or 3 times for a low amount of minutes.. that way you wont burn..because you will have what they call a base tan.. also use a protecting lotion especially on your face. Are you pasty white?? Do you usually burn?? You want to have a lotion with at least 15spf for your face but if you are naturally fair skinned and burn easily i suggest a sunblock... you will still get a little tan but you will protect your skin from sun damage which can cause skin cancer...|`|eIYHIUOqaa	use sunscreen. you'll still tan, i promise. i've used spf 45 my entire life and always end up looking like i'm from a different race.|`|kiOjChe6aa	dont tan ewwwww !!! over 30 it will look wrinkly
eitqO5Rmaa	Um...can I please just take a moment to say how much I LOVE Jergens Natural Glow (Revitalizing Daily Moisturizer)? I'm a freakishly pale redhead who would much rather wear leggings and tights year-round than blind passersby with my whiteness, but my mum talked me into trying this stuff out. I use the kind for Medium Skin Tones because the change is more noticeable (the Light Skin Tones branch does nothing whatsoever) without being obvious. No streaks, no nastiness, no orange hue...and even better, the scent is wonderful! It keeps my legs soft and glowing, no matter what. I put it on every three or four days in the spring and summer, and now I can't stop looking at my beautiful legs!<br>  <br>  I found a buy-one-get-one-free deal at CostCo / BJ's / Sam's Club, but I'm positive it's also at Target, etc. for a great price.<br>  <br>  Check it out here: <a href="http://jergens.com/Our_Collection/Product_Detail.asp?ProductID=34" rel="nofollow">http://jergens.com/Our_Collection/Produc...</a><br>  <br>  What I do is shave, dry my legs, then apply the lotion. I wait a couple minutes and then take a damp washcloth and wipe the tops of my feet, my ankles, the backs of my feet, and my knees (since those areas typically tan at a different rate). And then...voilá! You're lovely. (: (:

jUuYMVqiaa	the upper back is a good place. you can deff cover it easy.<br>  as for the tattoo, that is a personal decision, if you feel like you will want that for the rest of your life, then get it.<br>  but if you are unsure then dont.<br>  <br>  but your back is an area that is easily covered and when you get old you'll only have to see it when you look at your back in the mirror. ha thats the way i like to think of it.|`|GUEsVdaFaa	Just make sure it's something you really love and you won't regret it. I have three tattoos (out of 8 total) that I really regret, but the only reason I regret them is because they were very random "I'm bored" tattoos and I didn't think them through. Now I have a frog, a number 13 and an astrology symbol that I'm trying to find new designs to cover. <br>  <br>  As far as the job and marriage thing goes, you can avoid those issues easily. Keep any ink you get in a place that's easy to hide with a shirt or pants. And don't get any girl's names tattooed on you unless it's your family. <br>  Age really won't affect you until you get up into your 60's, since that's when your skin changes the most. People who are that old now have really terrible looking tattoos because techniques have changed and advanced a lot since they got their ink. Now, tattoo artists use different inks, machines, needles and techniques to prevent age changes as much as they can. Plus, if you really regret it that much later you can always just get it removed, or covered by another tattoo.|`|K2dNndE2aa	if you want them go for it, and since it means a lot to you you probably won't regret it. but for the job thing, you shouldn't have ANY problem since it's on your back and very easily will be covered...for marriage, if she loves you enough i doubt she'd really care if you had tattoos. my mom despises tattoos but she's engaged to someone with 4, and she's thinking about letting me get one when i'm 18 even though i won't need her permission (couple of months from now). when you're old i don't think it would really matter...your back doesn't change shape much like arms or abs do or something so it won't stretch as much, plus the majority of your life it'll look real good, and it means a lot to you. i doubt you'd be showing your back a lot when you're real old.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	I have three names on my arm and I don't regret them at all.  If this is an idea you've only been contemplating the past month, then I'd sit on it longer.  If you have any reservations at all, then don't do it.  You have the rest of your life to examine your values, so if these three words are still important to you down the road, then get them then.|`|os6OfNlaaa	well, if your thinking you'll regret them don't get them.|`|Ym6PCJRYaa	I HAVE 3 TATTOOS- ONE OF MY CAT (WHICH I THOUGHT I WOULD REGRET- BUT SHE LOOKS SEXY (SHES ON MY UPPER HIP- SHE SITS RIGHT ON THE THE TOP OF MY JEANS- VERY UNIQUE ALSO.<br>  I ALSO HAVE 2 FOR MY SON WHO PASSED AWAY-<br>  HIS FEET- NAME AND DATES- HIS NAME AND DATES DONE IN MY OWN HANDWRITING MADE IT EVEN MORE UNIQUE AND SPECIAL.<br>  I WAS REALLY NERVOUS FOR ALL MY TATTOOS BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN.<br>  JUST THINK- THE BEST PART IS- IT WILL BE VERY UNIQUE. <br>  ----JUST BE CAREFUL---- MY EX HUBBY HAD 3 DONE FOR FREE AND YOU CANT EVEN TELL WHAT IN THE WORLD THEY ARE!!

It's a Hello Kitty with Japanese Kanji that says Princess. It means something to me deeper than the fact that it's just cute. I know that no matter how old I get that meaning is still going to be true for me and I won't regret it. With tattoos, if you think you will regret it, don't do it. It's better to not have it than to have it and regret it. If you end up getting it, make sure that's exactly what you want. Also, if you are afraid of the effects it might have on future endeavors such as jobs, etc, make sure you get the tattoos in places that aren't readily seen in a normal situation.

It does hurt a bit, but not a lot, my recommendation to you is to never do it the week before your period since you tend to be more sensitive and number two, take a motrin before you to help with the pain and swelling ( there is a bit from the hair pulling) but once you get used to it you never want to go back to shaving, waxing will last longer and you are cleaner for a longer time.

They also have chemical peels for acne. It would be best to discuss the different types of procedures with the doctor because it will be based on certain things about you, like how sensitive your skin is.<br>  As for plumping your lips, there are a lot of different types of lip plumpers out there. Some of them work, but a lot are pretty expensive.<br>  I personally like Lip Venom, but I haven't tried a lot of them. There are probably others that work even better. And some of them kind of burn (Lip Venom does for me, but it's a tingly burn).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/search/search_results.jhtml;jsessionid=ORUVI5LXRJ0LGCV0KRRQX0Q?command=text&attr1=lip+plumper&attr2=&%2Fcom%2Flvmh%2Fcommerce%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%2Fiphrase%2Fproxy%2FIPhraseSearchFormHandler.search=search&_D%3A%2Fcom%2Flvmh%2Fcommerce%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%2Fiphrase%2Fproxy%2FIPhraseSearchFormHandler.search=+&searchString=lip+plumper&_DARGS=%2Fincludes%2FsearchFinder.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/search/search_res...</a>

I talked to my dermatologist the other day on how to get rid of them. She told me that you can use those little nose strips to get rid of some of them, but that you will never fully be able to get rid of all of them. Most people have them. They just will never fully go away because they are so deep in the skin.|`|UH4lU7MEaa	Apply aloe vera to the blackheads. Aloe vera is available in most drug stores, however you can also use the juice directly from the plant. Simply break off a bit of the plant and you'll find the aloe vera juice inside. Aloe vera has soothing properties and helps speed the healing process. You will see your skin recover more quickly from the blackheads as a result of using it.|`|u93oneUXaa	I use those blackhead strips from clean and clear I think..

jh8vWqQzaa	the above advice is solid except for the antibacterial soap.  this will prevent new skin cells from forming, which will prolong healing ( and any problems you are having.)  I have my own theory about placing hoops in cartilage.  if that's what you have, you might think about having it changed out to a post.  I like labrets.  mainly because the disc side won't fall off.  but try the sea salt soaks first: 1/8 to 1/4 tsp in 8 oz warm water.  saturate a cotton ball and soak for 3-5 min, 3-5 times a day.  if you can find Emu Oil, get some.  it works great.|`|jUuYMVqiaa	cartilage is Notorious for bumps, but the question is: is it scar tissue (keloid) or a bump full of pus/blood/other fun things?? because i got those puss bumps on both of my nostril piercings and my cartilage, they would come and go for about the first year i had them done. these bumps you dont really have to worry about, its keloids you have to worry about. they are permanent and can only be removed surgically.<br>  <br>  having one of those puss bumps doesnt really mean its infected, more or less its just irritated. i would clean mine with sea salt solution and sometimes pop them and let them dry up. this seemed to work for me beacuse they went away after about a year or less.<br>  cartilage takes ForEver to heal, so expect stuff like this to happen for a while.<br>  <br>  avoid the ipod headphones, this could likely be the cause of the irritation.<br>  but my advice: clean twice a day with antibacterial soap, nothing else. and treat with sea salt solution once a day.

It puts more emphasis on your forehead.  Try a curly style that covers your ears and rounds out your face.  By adding the curliness to the sides the focus is off of your forehead.

bb7a819d86a1ee778401709e1bda0185aa	hola amiga Los piercing han sido usados a lo largo de la historia por diferentes culturas como los soldados romanos o los mayas. En distintas partes del cuerpo y con distinto significado.<br>  <br>  mira el hombligo es una parte del cuerpo que tarda mucho en sanarse mas o menos hasta un a?o para sanar completamente, puede aver infexiòn? si tambien desde qu eno te cuides porsupuesto, debes limpiarlo bien todos los dias y tres veces al dia con sal marina, pones a hervir la sal marina en un poquito de agua y te limpias esta te ayuda para prevenir infexiones y para sanar tambien, en la boca es una perforaciòn muy censilla para una persona profecional en esto, el labio dura mas o menos de 5 a 6 meces en sanar bien, tambien hay riesgo pero no tanto como en el ombligo ya que esta perforaciòn esta expuesta a las salibaciones d el?a boca que lo mantienen umedo y ayuda a sanar mas rapido siempre y cuando hagas tambein buchesitos d ela misma sal marina y tambein te eches por fuerita de el labio, de seguro que te sana muy bien, poner cuidado de no lastimarse ya que por cada lastimada es un comienso para la piel volver a empezar a sanar y puede ocasionar keloides al rededor de la perforaciòn, los keloides son la piel que s elastima y se va saliendo por los laditos de la perforaciòn es blanca y tu la tocas y no te duele, esto se puede quitar pero es mejor prebenir lastimarse por que en muchas ocasiones los keloides reaccionan bien feo y hacen inflamar la piel mucho hasta llegar a el punto de salir sangre y un dolor impresionante que la unica soluciòn es quitarselo y tomar antibioticos para que sane bien y no queden huellas...<br>  <br>  si quieres hacerte una perforaciòn ten en cuenta lo sigueinte<br>  <br>  # Que es importante que minimice los riesgos de infección teniendo la seguridad que los materiales que se usen estén esterilizados adecuadamente.<br>  <br>  # El entrenamiento de la persona que va a realizar la perforación.<br>  <br>  # Qué complicaciones pueden surgir de la colocación del piercing. Si esto sucediera qué medidas hay que tomar y donde debe recurrir.<br>  <br>  # Evitar realizarse perforaciones durante el verano porque el riesgo de infección aumenta.<br>  <br>  # Asesorarse de los cuidados a realizar en el sitio de la perforación.<br>  <br>  # Averiguar que tipo de metal es aconsejable utilizar para la 1° perforación.<br>  <br>  # Averiguar el tiempo de cicatrización de la perforación.<br>  <br>  aaaaaaaaaaa y lo de no poder tener hijos gracias a una infecciòn es mas carreta que el mismo que lo dice, esta bien que salga queloides y se enrrojesca y se inflame pero a correr el riezgo de no tener hijos es por que tu hombligo tiene que ser saqueado y para que sea saqueado tenes que estar muerta por que el hombligo es una parte vital para el cuerpo humano<br>  <br>  bueno te mando un beso y ten en cuenta cada puento que es bien importante un abrazo bien fuerte.....|`|4Pxlouffaa	Compra el piercing de titanio que no suele producir alergias.

No comas comida picante hasta que se te cicatrice, lávate los dientes después de cada comida y te recomiendo que te hagas gárgaras con bicarbonato. También procura limpiarlo con un algodón muy suavemente después de comer, y si fumas o bebes también. <br>  Debes mantener este proceso intentando no salteártelo ni una vez hasta por lo menos 8 semanas.

AhFhek9daa	I did and vwas very disapointed. It didn't work well, so i came back to the roll-on Veet wax. Much better, easy to use, mess free and then apply the strip and pull...<br>  It works on small hair as said on the box. Hte only thing is hair grow at their pace, and waxing once won't make it last longer than a week, unless you let your legs turn into monkey legs before you wax to be sure to get rid of all hair for 3 weeks.<br>  Maybe the easiest for you would be to buy an electric hair remover, they work like wax, except you can do it with very small hair and it is a one time buy. I use that now for every part. At first, bikini lines and armpits hurt, but then, like for the legs, it is very bearable after the first couple times.|`|kPMT0itEaa	I tried them and it didn't work very well either as well.   I still have the remainder of the box and not too sure what I will do with them.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	they not very good
vEYjov2vaa	i think a girl with a 36C size chest can have naturally perky breasts..i actually am a 36C and i would consider them to be pretty perky haha..but i have friends who are that size or bigger that aren't. i count them being perky if the girl can not wear a bra and her breasts are still at the same level on her chest or a little lower (if she was wearing a push up) when she isnt wearing a bra.|`|2cc5b6b3e067fca80d88d8898a7b6638aa	i dont have a 36c breast 'yet' lol, mine is smaller than that but mine is really perky since im still single*wink<br>  i think its possibe to have both, esp if its not saggy and too faty|`|a268c12b5ec47775ab6f4e878095ab26aa	Its possible, what makes breasts 'perky' is the pectoral muscles behind them. If you work out your pecs a lot, your boobs will sag less.|`|48242c5bb73923ca5ae96bd7c46400e2aa	yeah its normal, and u can tell when they really stick out of ur shirt, or out of a low cut top and when guys stare ....:)|`|HkuzxFk9aa	Well im a m a 36 C and i do. LOL. I consider perky to be able not to wear a bra and not look like grandma. LOL

I've noticed uggs are STILL regular price almost everywhere and it's almost June.

Step back and see what shape your face is.|`|AA12265902	it really has to do with the shape of your chin , your forehead and your hairline,,,,,,,,,most people are triangle    their face is wider in the forehead arear then it is in their chin,,,,, a block type face is where both are fairly even,,,, a heart shaped face is when your chin is noticably narrow, and often you have a "widows peak" in the middle of your hairline, it dips down,,,  a round face is just that, your face looks more round then any of the other discriptions, is usually fairly even all the way around, including width of cheek area in porportion to forehead and chin

ygxkhxRAaa	The best conditioner for you to use in your hair is one that you can put in and leave it in.  Those that you put in and wash out in 3 to 5 minutes only coats the outside of the hair.  You need a deep conditioner in your hair.  There are quite a few of them on the market.  Go to a Beauty Store and ask the clerk to show you there Deep Hair Conditioners or go to a Beauty Shop and let them give you a Shampoo with a Deep Conditioner every two week or once a month.|`|1kHkaghsaa	i don't leave my conditioner in for any length of time,<br>  i suggest Garnear Fructise products, my hair smells sooo<br>  good and is very soft from those.|`|64lSwX4Maa	When I'm on holiday I wet my hair in the morning, slather it in conditioner, put it up.

(Well, that and it's appropriate for the environment -- no ripped jeans and tank tops in an office job, KWIM?)<br>  <br>  So - if you like the shirts, who cares if they're "so 1980's".  If you like them - get them and be proud.  (Even better if you ARE a child of the 80's :D  Then you're just being retro and reliving your childhood.

Your body shape has gone from ruler shape to pear shape.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's to do with changes in your hormone levels. Oestrogen is responsible for laying down fat on the hips and thighs. Are you on the pill? Do you have any other symptoms, besides weight gain and discomfort in your hips/thighs? Bloating, cravings, irregular periods, heavy periods, dry skin, loss of libido, mood swings, etc. If you do have any of these symptoms, it would be well advised to visit your doctor.<br>  <br>  HTH : )|`|ZYIOok9saa	you might want to go see your doctor you might have a certain disorder my friend has the same symptoms where you cant sit or stand for very long. the doctor prescribed medicine she is doing alot better know.
Tjxttc9laa	Its ok to use a lot. Use more on the ends than on the scalp, or your scalp will look oily. You can also rub a little bit on your brush bristles before brushing your hair, and it'll stay in for the day. It's also okay not to wash it all out - if you leave a little in, it'll often work better.<br>  <br>  I've never tried any of your choices, but my personal reccomendations would be Pantene ProV 'smooth & sleek', and Herbal Essences 'hello hydration'.<br>  You could also try natural hair remedies, like washing your hair with an egg (no hot water though, you dont want it to cook on your head!) or using a little olive oil when you wash your hair. <br>  <br>  If you want to try really high-end products and don't mind spending a lot of money on your hair, these are great:<br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P75405&categoryId=C7252&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P75405&categoryId=C7252&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P104704&categoryId=C7251&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a>|`|EHgb1rmEaa	Use some olive oil after you shower.|`|n592TE9waa	sunsilk.<br>  i actually tried it for the first time today and love it!|`|SDixcpLmaa	I like to use Herbal essence. Loreal is ok though. You can also use the leave in's they are better but can aid in dandruff build up! You should use enough but wash it out well.... Also Aussie conditioner was very good if you want a good conditioner with out build up on you hair and dandruff!|`|wSCtDmCWaa	sunsilk anti-poof is what i used to use i really like this.<br>  and it really depends on your type of hair to how much conditioner you use i have dry hair from dye's and perms, so i tend to use a little more than a quarter size amount run it through my hair and let it sit for a few minutes then wash it out. if you have baby type hair, the more conditioner you use, the more it will weigh it down, the website thats in the source box can help you with your type of hair.

But it doesn't mean you should feel like this. All you need to ask your self is are you happy with your weight and clothing? If you think you are OK, then don't worry!

Talk to a friend or your mum, they'll totally understand!|`|obentv1Faa	Most of the time, I get the stares too.  Irritating, I know.

But other than that, its perfectly normal. <br>  <br>  Even when I am wearing their clothing there, sometimes they do look at me funny, like i'm not the kind of person who is pretty enough to shop there. Ughh. <br>  <br>  Just ignore them. Once your outta there you won't have to deal with it anymore.

With that said there are studies that show that over exfoliation of the skin using too many AHA's and too much scrubbing will prematurely age the skin. When skin is over exfoliated in attempt to thwart aging it eventually reaches the Hayflick limit and begins to age itself. See this article: <a href="http://users.erols.com/gtodorov/skincare/aha_bha.htm" rel="nofollow">http://users.erols.com/gtodorov/skincare...</a><br>  <br>  As far as anti-aging antioxidants and peptides there have been no studies showing that early usage will damage your skin. With that said, some anti-aging creams will do nothing for you in your 20's. You can spend a lot on an anti-aging cream but if you don't have wrinkles or discoloration to address then you won't see any results you'll just be giving your skin a little bit more "nutrition". Anti-aging antioxidants are a good idea for all ages because they prevent free radical damage. Peptides are really not that important to use until you are in your 30's because they are a results oriented product meaning they will help repair damage but don't prevent it like anti-oxidants can. The best anti-aging you can do for yourself is to eat right, drink lots of water, take daily multi-vitamins, don't smoke, moderate alcohol consumption, exercise to get your circulation going and clean out your lymph system, and wear sunscreen with anti-oxidants in it daily. Protecting your skin and nourishing from the inside out is the best anti-aging you can do in your 20's.|`|058d4dec24187dd36e70e7dca0c8e04eaa	ya... umm it causes ur skin 2 feel like its getting older.. so it will probly age faster... and get age spots... but different will vary

216141096b1a257bc4d0dc41b925a001aa	If a person no longer groomed him/herself properly around me anymore, I would take it this way:<br>  <br>  1. If it were a close friend, I wouldn't really think much of it; infact I would be flattered that they are comfortable around me;<br>  <br>  HOWEVER:<br>  <br>  2. If it were a boyfriend - alarm bells would ring in my head if he were acting this way after a relatively short courting phase - meaning "Omg, is he taking me forgranted already?" --  BUT if he were  a boyfriend of a few years whom I feel perfectly secure with, I wouldn't mind it - it truly means he's comfortable with me, but I would still expect him to be perfectly groomed when the occasion calls for it. <br>  <br>  Friends who are comfortable enough around me and let their hair down infront of me are the ones I really appreciate - however if I noticed that a friend had totally let go of their grooming habits I would feel close enough to them to let them know - in a nice way, ofcourse.<br>  <br>  And then, ofcourse, I agree with your last sentiment - it could be that they are depressed and are bogged down with a really big problem and are focusing on that alone.

Then, take the mousse and put some in your hand, rub your hands together so that you have an even amount on both hands. After that, put your hair over each shoulder (right hair over right shoulder, left hair over left shoulder) and use one of your hands to scrunch the mousse into your hair evenly, make sure you get the mousse evenly everywhere in your hair, bottom, top, sides, underneath, everywhere, and then repeat with the other side. If you want, you can flip your hair over and then scrunch the mousse in, but that can make your hair a bit poofy. When you're done scrunching the mousse even into your hair, scrunch the top part of your hair, but not too much, just to make sure that they get a bit of curling action as well. After that, just let your hair air dry and touch as litlle as possible, the more you touch, the more poofy/frizzy it'll get. Oh, and do a deep conditioning treatment once a week=] It'll help your hair maintain better curls and be healthier, good luck!|`|12f01cc7f6985df6a786fa07b03c29b5aa	wash it towel dry then put the mouse on while its still a little damp do not blow dry, that'll make it worse also use a pick or a vent brush using a brush can make your frizz worse unless you comb it while its still wet then that can work ok just no hairdryers those things do more damage then good

Don't wear it around your waist like they show in mags, try it around your hips and you'll be good.

I would wear it either with a black top and and a belt to a DARK jean - Blue Cult mayhaps or Rock and Republic.  I think it'd be better using it around your midsection/stomach over a black top that hangs low with dark jeans<br>  <br>  The big buckle is cool - gaudy is in.|`|qHGG6Dmuaa	I'm imagining:<br>  <br>  --> layered beaters (tank tops), skinny jeans or regualr jeans, the belt in place without having your beaters cover the buckle. You want it to be outlined.<br>  --> jean skirt also with the layering. <br>  --> if you dont want to be too BOLD with this belt, don't wear black. BLACK will outline the neon pink belt even more! It's like chalk on a chalkboard. The first thing that catches your eye is the writing on the chalkboard. But if you want to try it out, you can. It can be cute with the right accesories, shoes, and such.<br>  The layering should make it less BOLD since there is other things that soften the whole look.<br>  =]

1c7b0d7f18c58cc17a94e197cb1f1b57aa	nikki has the right idea.. u just have to wait and moisterize|`|3cad7fca8a1ace63407d2de9d0cbc874aa	Yes you can!  Wait a few weeks I suggest at least 2-4 weeks... Just so you know a perm is a strong solution its usually high on the ph scale if it is an alkaline perm... There are also acid perms that are less on the ph level but they are more for body/body waves!  Also because of the alkalinity in a perm your haircolor is going to fade or possibly dull a litte (strips the color)!  I usually try to convince people not to get a perm because it isnt the in fashion at the moment and its exactly as described permanent!  I would recommend having an acid wave perm... Matrix is a good one to use!  You didnt specify how curly you want it to be but I wouldnt go any smaller than white rods... I would probably alternate white with purple if you are looking for curl... If you are looking more for body I would alternate peach and orange!  Because your hair is thick you might need an alkaline perm because it is a stronger solution (this will be more likely to fade out your red)!  Red is a very hard color to remove and it is also hard to keep this is due to its molecule size!  If you have a hairstylist perm your hair make sure to tell them what brand haircolor you used on your hair... This is very important in order to avoid a bad chemical reaction or an overprocessed effect!  Good Luck!|`|0a3ecde4cde9a9d580733f222785f56caa	It will seriously damage your hair if you do. Perms have very harsh chemicals, as well as hair dye. If you are going to do it, you may wish to wait a while in between perming and dyeing.  It might be better to dye second...ask your hair stylist.<br>  <br>  But if your hair is very short, a perm probably isn't the best way to go.|`|3b2caf4ed5be14fbe5c4ac3e7684e28daa	You should always perm before color, the perm solution will lighten your color, you may end up with a washed out red rather then a rich red, also, condition,condition, condition! It is recommended to wait at least 24 hours after perming to color, I would then go with a good conditioning semi-permanent color, such as Redken or Goldwell. You can always go with a permanent haircolor at a later time, after your hair recovers some.|`|AA10740893	Yes, you may want to consult your hair stylist. If you are doing it at home then good luck.

eSgOA3xCaa	It depends how good you want it to look, so say if you're using it for a party or something and you're looking for a wacky colour, the cheaper ones are good because they dont stay in long and they aren't as 'permanent'.. But if you're looking for one for just every day and say if you want to see what you look like in a certain shade, the more expensive ones are always best. They cost more, but the end product is alot more sophisticated and it looks more natural.<br>  <br>  Never use a semi-perminent dye, its nasty. It takes all the chemicals out of your hair and the colour is not as good as a permanent one.|`|57OIhKeTaa	at the barber shop|`|QzzvmyF4aa	You should be able to get it at any grocery store that sells regular hair dye.  Watch out for black, though.  I did my hair with black wash out dye and left it in too long and it had a purple hue for like a week.  I don't know of any that just last a couple washes though.  The products that are out there last a couple weeks, maybe a month.  Good luck!|`|VB50gLOZaa	any place that sells hair care products...sally's is a great place...they sell manic panic which make really fun and funky haircolor that is washable...

hTzqOtRGaa	Honey, go anywhere they sell patterns.  Find one that you like.  In other words, if you want a set-in waist band or elastic all around.  Once you've made the decision, you can make the shorts the length you want.

Hair down and curly and a simple make up cause the dress is very impressive and it would be too much if your make up is a lot! I would say just the black line with the eyeliner, a lot of mascara, a bit of slight pink rouge and dark red lipstick[with the red one] or a pink [with the blue one]. And if you don't have shoes l would recommend flat "ballet" shoes, it will look very classy ;o)

Or you could flip your head down and either blowdry your hair upside down for volume or put product in it and then scrunch it  up with your fingers to give it more volume..|`|T2n1ufNTaa	Attach a diffuser to your hair dryers nose, hang your head upside down (with headband on) and blast it on high. Scrunch while drying. Make sure it dries thoroughly, use some hairspray so it can stay. O and make sure your hair is wet beforehand.|`|GfKVWUROaa	did you say poof the back of your hair or poof the hair on your back ???|`|ee2904f8c09b271c2ed5f1a37b61ed08aa	There is no such thing as "poofing up your hair". I don't care what someone told you. There isn't. The most that you will actually be able to do to give your hair a fuller look is give yourself a set. Give yourself various layers of curls with your flat iron/brush and blow dryer and then comb them comepletely out. That's all you have to do. Then you can kind of fluff it up a little with your fingers then comb it back down a little. That's ALL you can do. There is no other reasonable answer that doesn't involve something like hair pieces and extentions.

Y6mhsmUZaa	The skin is thinner on your palms and bottom of the feet than on the rest of the body.  Since your skin absorbs water and water strips away the natural oils your body produces, your toes and fingers get wrinkly.  The rest of the body has a thicker layer of skin, so that's why it doesn't wrinkle in the water.|`|40268b58f847e3447545436ae48be462aa	Because there are nerve endings in your fingers and toes|`|cfd345105d97b375462a9e42239414dfaa	because your fingers and your toes are sensitive....they dont have as much skin as the rest of your body!!!<br>  anyways yeah thats about all i know about it!!!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  <br>  MUAH*|`|y6yC8NjOaa	"Your skin soaks up water. Our skin has a kind of waterproof oil on it called sebum. That's why water rolls right off your skin in the bath or shower. If you spend too much time in the water, the sebum washes away and guess what? You're not so waterproof anymore. Your skin soaks up the water causing it to swell in some places which makes it look wrinkly. Now, this only happens on your toes and fingers because they don't have any hair. The hair follicles on the rest of your body are able to keep making enough sebum so it doesn't wash away."(1)<br>  <br>  "When hands are soaked in water, the keratin absorbs it and swells. The inside of the fingers, however, does not swell. As a result, there is relatively too much stratum corneum and it wrinkles, just like a gathered skirt. This bunching up occurs on fingers and toes because the epidermis is much thicker on the hands and feet than elsewhere on the body. (The hair and nails, which contain different types of keratin, also absorb some water. This is why the nails get softer after bathing or doing the dishes.)" (2)<br>  <br>  This is some information that I found.  I hope it's helpful.  If you need more explanation, I'll be more than happy to try to make it clearer.<br>  <br>  PS:  The stratum corneum is simply the scientific name for the outermost layer of skin.  <br>  PSS:  The skin on your hands and your feet is actually 40 times thicker than the skin on the rest of your body.   "On most of the body, this layer is quite thin, just .015 of a millimeter, but it's 40 times as thick, or 0.6 of a millimeter, on the soles and palms." (3)

I took about a month to work and then it really worked well for about 4 or 5 months. After that it seemed they both had breakouts and each stopped using it when that happened.  After that, their skin cleared up and pretty much stayed clear.  For the best results with your skin, first of all, DRINK LOTS OF WATER!!! It truly does flush your system and clears your skin.

So, no.|`|heyveea9aa	yes it does work but it can dry out your skin really bad sometimes like on the cheeks and stuff. and for me anyways it made my t-zone oilier which was really anoying. but it works differently for different people.

kcjGdCS7aa	Bahla,<br>  <br>  You are an unhappy guy and no one can blame you. Acne sucks big time...but there are solutions dear friend!<br>  <br>  If you have dark spots (aka hyperpigmentation) left behind by acne, you have a number of ways of getting rid of them. <br>  <br>  1) Your dermatologist can prescribe Tretinoin/Tretinoid. This is a topical derivative of Vitamin A and it's effective at diminishing and erasing dark spots. It’s the best product against acne. Apply is at night and it will control the growth of new acne. You will see improvements within 3-4 days. It’s a fraction of that other product advertised on the TV (you know the one I’m talking about).<br>  <br>  2) If you book a consultation session with a medical spa, you can get information of Glycolic Peels, Photo Facials, Microdermabrasion and laser resurfacing. Depending on the colour of your complexion, your cosmetic dermatologist or your cosmetic nurse will recommend the best treatment for you.<br>  <br>  3) Kojic Acid is also known to reduce hyperpigmentation. Your cosmetic dermatologist can help you there again.<br>  <br>  4) There are also other topical products that can help face acne marks and your cosmetic dermatologist can help you there again.<br>  <br>  5) A home base exfoliant mask can also help in accelerating skin renewal.<br>  <br>  You should be very careful with fading creams that are sold without a prescription because some (many) can cause cancer in the long run. There are some pretty scary stories coming out of the UK about those types of creams.<br>  <br>  For your oily skin, it would be recommended that you use a clarifying astringent once you're done cleansing your skin. This will help manage the sebum level in your skin. During the summer months, you might need to cleanse your skin a couple times per day. Even with oily skin you should avoid regular soap and opt for a cleansing gel. <br>  <br>  My best recommendation to you is to consult a dermatologist or cosmetic dermatologist (found in every city in Canada). If you go blindly into trying to fix a situation without proper knowledge, you may end up with a worst case than what you started out with...and you wouldn't want that to happen.<br>  <br>  Gisele<br>  <a href="http://www.mybeautymatch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybeautymatch.com</a>|`|847417111e404b173ef807d93d384ed5aa	i suffer aswell, ok well you have to sclean your skin dail morning and b4 u go to sleep, with a cleanser, oil build up? i dunno ur skin type. umm too much foundation? it could be variouse things. like i cant eat too many straberrys i break out. yea suks, my favs too. umm use cleames with alchohols and acids in themm umm and scaring theres multiple creams.|`|8c812c5e1155816ce1cc84eb4aa152e2aa	try proactive, if that doesnt work:<br>  <br>  clean your face at least twice a day. <br>  drink lots of water<br>  it may not be the same for everybody, but dont eat too much fried stuff, because your skin will react to it, and you might get acne-ish stuff/pimples.|`|ToYn3dZmaa	Anything with benzoyl peroxide works the best for me. I believe that's what Proactiv has in it, and Clean & Clear also makes one cleanser with it. Also, what I eat seems to make a difference for me (not greasy foods). I think it varies a lot from person to person but that's what works for me.

4xZ7XGuiaa	well, dont try to cover it up with make-up. that makes it irritated and will look fake. to make it feel better rub aloe on it, stops ths stinging. the burn will fade after a few days but then the dead skin might start to peel. whatever you do, dotn try to speed up the process up with creams and ointments except for aloe. ull regret it later when your skin flares up.|`|4d86c3ed115c5b24550bac5761530374aa	Aloe Vera Gel!

3nnyZBbpaa	I doubt you'll get high your first time, because most people don't<br>  but if you do..you may feel a bit high anywhere from 30 mins to a couple of hours. your breath will be fine, but maybe have some gum handy. and i know one person said that it 'sticks to you like you can't imagine' but that is NOT true at all. unless you are in a very confined area with not much ventilation or something, then you won't have a problem. If you feel a bit nervous about it maybe bring perfume or cologne and spray yourself once-but its probably more suspicious to come home stinking of perfume.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps:)|`|4Hd1gdD1aa	I don't smoke either but I know kids that do.<br>  <br>  Not everyone gets high their first time<br>  You know when you're high<br>  You stay pretty stoned for a few hours<br>  You'll be a little baked for the rest of the day<br>  The smell sticks to you like you can't even imagine, it's impossible to get rid of<br>  <br>  This is NOT from experience!!!<br>  I went through a phase where I thought I was going to try it so I asked some kids that did it a lot and that's what they told me...<br>  <br>  But just being around weed, not even smoking at ALL, you smell like it until you shower and wash your hair and clothes!!!|`|BJYKkiWuaa	well, it'll prob'ly stay with 'em a while, be smart don't do it' do drugs once an' yer hooked, trust me i'm a recoverin' addict of inhalances. i ain't tryin' to be yer boss but it's just a smart thang to do, advice from a friend to a friend.|`|etWY35Z8aa	DUMB QUESTION!!|`|23JaDEJmaa	i say smoke up<br>  |`|uY3nu8pPaa	Dumbass.|`|msVN7GBpaa	first time i smokes weed i hit like 4 times and was SO high i thought the guy put other drugs in it.i stayed high for like 3 hours till i feel asleep i heard someone say it stay in your system up to a year but most people say 3months,i did not enjoy the high i was so miserable and i never touched it again.|`|yUgg0lPjaa	Yeah it would get you high if you actually opened your throught and inhaled deeply, it takes some practice, it will deff make you splutter and cough if you do it properly. Normally it would kindof make you spin out if you have a "chronic" which is a spliff only with ween and not with tabacco (dont smoke baccy, its bad). If you do mix it wouldnt be as strong. It would make you feelthis way for maybe 3 hours and you should chew gum and spray yourself with bodyspraay after you do it. It would linger for maybe an hour ? <br>  <br>  Haha hope i helped !|`|VwWVD84Oaa	four or five hits will probably get u high depending on how good the stuff is<br>  <br>  u will be high for like a peaking point of 30 min, and maybe a couple of hours coming down<br>  <br>  i would reccomend taking a breath mint or something cuz ur breath will prolly smell<br>  <br>  if u smoke outside u should only smell like it for like 30 min-1 hr.. just incase tho use some sort of spray|`|B93hQfWDaa	there are some mean and ignorant people on this web site. they are just "wanna be" experts. dont trust want they say. yes five puffs can get you sort of high. and it last 30 mins.<br>  <br>  |`|3bLNyHIgaa	why are you high now lol,,, it will pass don't worry. spray something on maybe help cover the smell up. chew gum to help with breath

f9cec35b20affb8f8633431faa9dbf5aaa	Hola! mira yo tengo uno desde 1996 jejej! y he puesto unos cuantos tambien (antes me dedicaba a eso)<br>  <br>  CUando te lo hacen no duele ya que tu lengua es muy suave de atravezar, Pero... En unas horas la lengua se te hincha al grado que no puedes cerrar los dientes, cuesta mucho trabajo hablar ya que el movimiento de la lengua duele al hacerlo, (Yo cuando queria hablar babeaba espantosamente), debes llevar una dieta liquida por 3 o 4 dias aprox (intente comer un pan suave y tuve que sacarlo con el dedo porque dolia mucho al mover la comida de un lado a otro) y evitar picante, embutidos, alcohol, drogas, grasas,carne de puerco.<br>  Asi que esos dias seria muy dificil que tu mama no notara algo raro.<br>  Despues ya que esta tu lengua bien puedes evitar que lo vean hablando con la boca un poco mas cerrada y riendote con los dientes juntos jejeje todo un show. ?no?<br>  Habla con tu mama, dale las razones del porque lo quieres y DILE... que es algo que te puedes quitar y no se sabra que algun dia lo tuviste!!|`|29816266e1ad392625dcda50bfe3ac80aa	Pues por supuesto que tiende a inflamarse un poco y no hablaras como de costumbre porque es algo nuevo que esta interfiriendo en tu habla (lengua), se va a dar cuenta, pero bueno hazlo, una vez que lo tengas seguramente ya no te dirá nada, los primeros días es un poco incomodo en cuestión de algo de dolor y las comidas, luego te acostumbras, te digo esto porque una amiga mía se lo hizo.|`|18hzS300aa	Si lo vas a ocultar para que te lo vas a poner ?|`|5t44aWhxaa	si duele un poco y como es una zona húmeda tarda un poquito mas en cicatrizar|`|8021a1d0b47157baa5803dfc892ed5dbaa	Duele dependiendo de a donde te valla a hacertelo a veces nos topamos con lugares donde lo hacen pero no son muy bueno y te causan mas dolor que si fueras a otro lugar con mayor experiencia, la recuperacion es algo tormentosa pues como es la boca al comer, al hablar te puede lastimar o molestar, tienes que tener mucha higiene por la comida ya que puedes causarte una infeccion, quizas algun anticeptico te ayude, para ocultarlo pues solo que evites hablar demaciado o reirte.<br>  <br>  Si decides hacertelo mas que tener cuidado en que tu madre no se entere fijate en el lugar, que halla higiene pues podrias contraer alguna enfermedad mas fuerte y grave que una simple infeccion. y de cualquier forma los mismos que te hacen la perforacion te pueden dar especificaciones de los cuidados que debes tener, a de mas de la higiene se te recomienda no comer productos de puerco ya que dificultan que tu organismo sane rapidamente.<br>  <br>  Suerte|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	dicen k duele|`|19ad0f4f601223792cfc1a915a4857c9aa	Obvio te duele. Al principio se te inflama y no puedes hablar bien. Aquí en Chile te dan unas cosas para que te enjuages la lengua, luego de que te lo pongan.|`|45efa58ec98e8ec5282ad50940ae54acaa	Tengo uno hace 3 a?os, en el momento de hacerlo no duele, pero los tres días subsiguientes no puedes ni mover la lengua del dolor.  Una vez pasado este periodo, te costará algunos días más acostumbrarte a hablar y comer normalmente con él, luego ni te das cuenta que lo tienes!<br>  <br>  Te que la única forma de ocultarlo es no hablando de frente a la persona que no quieres que lo vea, pues siempre se nota cuando abres la boca para hablar.  Me parece que si eres menor de edad, y requieres de la autorización de tus padres para ello, no debes hacertelo sin su consentimiento, pues existen riesgos secundarios al hacerte el "piercing".  Por lo demás mi consejo es,que si te gusta, lo hagas...  ;)|`|6c75dee54db7162940910312e5b6d7d1aa	Si puedes hablar solo que es un poco molesto al inicio ademas de que no puedes comer cosas solidas , todo lo que mencionas en verdad solo se quita tantito tiempo despues de que te lo pones|`|BwDUOnKlaa	Mira, en cuanto al dolor, no creo que sea en cuanto te lo hacen, sino el periodo después (como pasa con todas las heridas).<br>  <br>  En cuanto a eso, pues dos amigas se lo han hecho:<br>  -Una dijo que pues la inflamación no fue nada del otro mundo<br>  -La otra dijo que fue horrible y se lo quitó al día siguiente<br>  <br>  <br>  Espero que te sirva|`|FU5wmepKaa	Si se inflama, yo tengo uno en la nariz pero mi primo tiene un o en la lengua, y al principio hablas todo enredado , y dependiendo del clima en q vivas se te inflama mas o tarda menos en cicatrizar, tienes q darle los cuidados necesarios, y si duele ps toda perforacion duele !. pero tampoco es para tanto. mira yo llevo apenas 6 meses y por una u otra razon he tenido q volverlo a perforar 2 veces mas.

Y para ocultarlo, al principio, pues trataba d no abrir mucho la boca, al hablar, y si se reía, trataba de taparse la boca, con la excusa de que tenia gripe, o algo así, y como "según se contagia", pues nadie le decía nada.<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte, y cuidado de no comer chicle la primera semana, porque si no se te va a enredar en el piercing.|`|navV9O7taa	Pues la inflamación de la lengua es en algunas personas tube uno y no se me inflamo mucho, te recomiendo que te comas algo bueno antes de ponertelo porque no podras comer nada sólido en 3 días, enjuagate bien cada vez que comas con Listerine trata de limpiarte la lengua con un hisopo y no bebas alcohol ni beses se te puede infectar.. Come mucho helado y hielo para que en caso de inflamacion te baje rapido..|`|oDiooNixaa	Duele y no vas a poder ocultarlo porque tendrás dificultades para hablar,conozco gente que incluso le costaba mucho comer.|`|wHEi9IGPaa	debe ser horrible!!! no t  hagas esa sonsera por las puras!!

Kql7dn7Waa	Just lose about 4 to 5 pounds. I would try running. If you want to fit into a 4 roughly try doing wall sits you will gain muscle and with all of the running you will lose weight at the same time and it will even out and you will be able to fit into a size 4 roughly. Hope this helps.|`|LNUqi5iBaa	Well, my mom started excersizing and lost a few inches in her waist and thighs. She didn't lose any weight at all. <br>  <br>  By the way, she used a Gazelle. They're nice! You can watch TV while excersizing. Also, I'm not sure but she did that for a few months or less. Good luck!|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	rather than worrying abpout gaining or loosing weight consider trying on a different style or brand of jean. two people that fit the same size can have different weights and waist sizes, body shape has alot to do with it. you can also have pants professionally altered if you are stuck between two sizes <br>   to get a better idea of what it would take to fit into a smaller size look online for any clothing store and check out their fitting guides. I seriously wouldn't advise loosing weight. maybe you could do toning exercises and gain muscle. it sounds like you are already thin enough and I mean that as a compliment. Its not worth becoming underweight to fit into a smaller size.|`|FhlecdhKaa	try ae jeans.they go by only even number so u can get a 4 that would problly fit ur perfect

Wi2jk9RSaa	Yes!  A guy that rates a girl an 8, definitely thinks that she is good looking.  Attraction is the first part of getting someone to notice you, and if he rated you an 8, then you''ve got the attraction part down, (even though a "rating" is kinda of a immature way to ask).  Go for it!|`|vMKheLvLaa	It means he likes your looks. You asked him to rate you, so he was honest and said you were and 8. But...that doesn't mean he likes you... :p|`|Ks84DOYZaa	not necessarily<br>  he just thinks youre attractive :)<br>  look at it from his POV, do you have a crush on every guy you think is hot? not really right?<br>  This was strictly superficial|`|U2vr1sg5aa	it means he thinks your hot.<br>  <br>  <br>  he may like you, or he may just be being honest.<br>  <br>  ...youve thought guys were attractive but not liked them havent you?|`|AKBZNTOxaa	IT DOESN'T MEAN HE LIKES YOU IT JUST MEANS HE THINKS YOU ARE VERY CUTE|`|Xr4VGJEhaa	it means he likes the way you look. |`|etWY35Z8aa	no?|`|AA11040944	he probably thinks ur hot but still doesnt mean he likes u|`|sYzQ6esRaa	no not at all it just means that you told him to rate you and he rated you an 8 it just meant that he thought you were cute thats about it now if you ask him if he likes you it might be a different story|`|ia0F2tgraa	He could like you but you can't be sure becase he might just like how you look.<br>  You will have to see what he acts like around you in real life.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|A3RNp9hIaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuQgK38.zTU7uj0td_mvCp7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081004181943AAJmfg4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  HELP ME!<br>  no he doesnt like u, fool|`|XY50tAF9aa	no it doesnt really mean he likes you it just means he thinks your kind of hot or pretty. sry|`|ukH16Kb5aa	It means he thinks you are attractive.|`|rjGfMP4aaa	well it sure does say that he is interestin. keep pplayin wit him alil and c wat happeneds|`|BsNln4Csaa	he thinks your hottish|`|XGzVUtjVaa	no, it just means he thinks your pretty.|`|AA11731967	he prob just think ur atractive, he does not have to like u thou|`|YsYYQGeiaa	No it means he was just being nice and didnt want to hurt your feelings|`|QGrteAumaa	he just thinks your pretty.<br>  every guy i know thinks i'm pretty, but that doesn't mean they all like me.|`|ftWsPGNfaa	omggg, he doesnt have to like you to think that you are good looking. |`|ecFH28Yyaa	Maybe not he might just think that you are really pretty! <br>  Not a bad thing!
F77AfkUIaa	I've been cutting my own hair for four years now, and it's been fine and saved me a ton of money. And every time I've done it, I've put in some sort of layers.<br>  <br>  It would help to know how long your hair is and if you want the style truer to the first or the second picture.<br>  <br>  Either way, here's one of the methods I use:<br>  <br>  1) Get your hair slightly wet with water (either use a spray bottle or comb/brush some water into it)<br>  2) Use the comb, starting at the roots, to comb a section of hair straight out from your head (parallel to the ground) and cut straight up. To get more severe layers, use this same method only bring your hair & the comb straight up (parallel to your body). <br>  3) Repeat all over your head, wherever you want the layers<br>  <br>  To help with a choppier look (like on the bangs), literally cut little tiny bits with the scissors parallel to how your hair hangs.<br>  <br>  Here are my biggest tips: <br>  Take your time - it's easier to take more off than to figure out what to do once you've taken too much off.<br>  Have fun - with a lot of layers like the pictures, whatever you do will end up pretty damn good.<br>  Make notes - write down any new methods you figured out fooling around with your hair.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

NmV5XWlJaa	The three main Italian designer bags I know are<br>  Prada<br>  Bottega Veneta<br>  Gucci<br>  <br>  There are others, but I suggest you look up the websites for the different designers until you find the model you have in mind.|`|3L9bRmOqaa	Without a picture or even a picture that comes close to what you are describing, I cannot help pinpoint the designer name and the style of that bag.  Your description sounds like most Italian and French designer bags out in the market today.

RxoM7S0Faa	Well, it depends on what you wear it with and to what kinds of places. I think it's a really nice big bag. But it's not something to wear for everyday. But it's a good choice to wear to school, for example, so you can put your books/notebooks in it (if you don't carry a lot of them).<br>  <br>  And brown is IN, for those who don't know it. Brown is very IN in Europe, and Europe is the center of fashion. <br>  <br>  medium-sized and smaller bags - for everyday<br>  large bags - to carry a lot of stuff in them<br>  really small bags - for going out|`|Fuc57hcAaa	Well if you like it and matches your style, keep it!<br>  Its pretty simple, and the color will match with almost everything. <br>  Only use it if you can fill it up, if not you can use it as a beach bag, or a school bag if its solid!<br>  <br>  Personnaly, its not my style, but if you like it, who cares?<br>  Anyway, a bag is an accesory, its not supposed to be noticed..|`|JcBMgqaraa	Well no offense but its cute but also not cute wich makes it ugly, i dont like it but everybody has their opinon. sorry if i was no help|`|aTzvVtazaa	its ok...|`|ixBYbmvNaa	its fine w/ your figure , it looks cute [=|`|3L9bRmOqaa	I think you already answered that question.  First, if you REALLY liked this handbag, I don't think there would be any doubt in your mind.  As for the looks, I think it is a funky bag.  However, for a petite person, this bag will really look a bit odd because the shape will overwhelm your petite frame.  <br>  <br>  Is it too late to return the bag for something a bit smaller or maybe look for a bag that will make you go "Zowie!".|`|d7TgV7fcaa	sorry but i dont think so u want sumthin more classy not big and brown it has no fashion to it i guess its jus big and brown there is nuthin wrong with big purses ask a guy wat he thinks he wont lie and look at his facial expression dont feel bad buying an expensive purse or designer purse u feel better bout yourself and will have it for a long time so u wont have to worry bout gettin another one like i have a gucci purse and its brown but its got designs and it matches everything i wear and looks good!!!|`|4aUvexdRaa	i LUV  big purses!!<br>  <br>  and this one is beautiful|`|6fc53371b01ec327c2560b7b47e86977aa	Sorry but I think that giant purses would be best suited as large fashionable diaper bags.

If you curl the hair while it is in the pony, it is much faster to curl, plus the curls will still have body after the pony is taken out. That's my personal shortcut. If you are using a curling iron please invest in leave in conditioner or a heat activated one. Remember to use flexable hold styling products, you don't want stiff hair.

AA10553235	you are a natural beauty - what I would do is enhance what you u have. Great eyes ! buy a good eyelash curler - curl your lashes . apply black mascara . A little cream blush on your cheeks - and a nice "blush " type color gloss -that's it . <br>  for evening do the same but add alittle smoky brown  powder to the top lid & a little to the bottom - follow you lash line and keep it simple  & clean.

642c8bf6773358b823fc73e77688199daa	Use a liquid eyeliner and smudge with a Q-tip after applying. You may want to wait until it's partially dry before smudging.  <br>  <br>  This effect can also be achieved by using a very dark eyeshadow. Just apply it by wetting an eyeshadow brush then wipe the brush through the eyeshadow. You only want enough water to make the brush wet to the feel. Water shouldn't drip off of the brush. Apply the wet shadow as close to lashes as possible. Smudge with a Q-tip or the tip of your pinky finger.<br>  <br>  Do not pull on eyes when applying eye makeup.  It can cause premature aging and wrinkles.|`|OB8bJmsAaa	Apply eyeliner (pencil) to waterline and lash line and then using a smudge brush blend it out softly.

fNDI5HFTaa	I have the same promblem. I had ahuge one on the tip of my nose two weeks ago and tried the biore pore strips. That helped but did not solve the promblem. I would use Neutrogena blackhead remover scrub and use that on your nose twice a day. You will see a huge improvement!!|`|SFtrgKa0aa	first apply a little cream and massage then take a facial steam, after that with a needle that is just to remove blackheads just squeeze the blackheads and then apply a face mask like Sandal wood or calamine face mask.That's it your blackheads are gone.|`|Xkl1Ukpraa	NEUTROGENA BLACKHEAD ELIMINATING FOAMING PADS.<br>  <br>  <br>  They are the only thing that has EVER worked for me, and I have awfullllll blackheads.|`|nGbSnOnSaa	oxypads|`|1PSolGHmaa	facial|`|d9nVMAuiaa	KKK|`|sym8DzH0aa	they have black head removers at the store i think they are a couple bucks .|`|AA10274582	i heard toothpaste|`|vAbDJDcQaa	1. Boil water and then put your face close to it, not too close that you burn yourself, but that you get steamed. Then use the strips if you still have them.<br>  <br>  2.Home-remedy: when you take a hot shower, scrape your nose with your nails, or something that won't hurt you or take off your skin. This helps to bring out the dirt and after doing it couple of times, you'll notice fewer blackheads. Keep doing it, and less pimples too. <br>  <br>  :) hope it works out for you, it was just a random thing I figured out while showering. |`|5OkPQPSbaa	Heres some things you can do :)<br>  <br>   Wash your face in the morning & night. or whenever it feels oily <br>  <br>  Apply exfoliant or a scrub that will help remove dead skin from your face. <br>  <br>  get a wet rag and put it in the microwave for no more than 10 seconds.<br>  & put over your face.<br>  <br>  :)or see a dermatologist...( expensive though)<br>  <br>  good luck|`|bzyY0QRcaa	You are right, those strips work well. What you should do is wash your face first and them put a warm rag over your face so that your pores open up. Then wash your face again put toner on your face. If this does not work then getting a facial will be very beneficial.

f7bc7b5de8be913313ea5bdd158dbec3aa	Do you have arches on your feet? Perhaps you need a shoe with arch support, which ballerina flats generally do not have.|`|9cBLKOe8aa	I wear my flats out constantly, but if I'm going shopping or walking far distances they make my feet ache. |`|8Lp5bKROaa	Depends.. i have 3 pairs and one of them hurt that much i gave them away! The others i had to wear in but now they are great!|`|yKBI9N1Uaa	It depends on the flat. Sometimes, some of the flats don't really have a lot of cushion in them on the inside, so it feels like you're just walking in your bare feet and there's no padding.  My feet will start to hurt too after walking around in them for long periods of time.  I would recommend getting some shoe pads for your flats that don't have a lot of cushion in them.  This will help your feet hurt less!  I hope this helps! :)|`|Aki3sq5paa	I buyed a ballerina shoes too and my feet turns well just like happened to you|`|lBG9lFEAaa	Do they have an arch? If not thats why they hurt|`|rlUExTzfaa	Yes they do if you wear them when you will me doing a lot of walking. The reason is because most flats just don't have that much support/padding for the arch in your foot or the heel of your foot as it strikes the ground. I wore mine to a theme park on the weekend and yeah my feet were killing me afterwards! They look cute though :P And hurt less than heels I suppose, although maybe joggers may be more functional (but not nearly as attractive.)|`|vTw9yifzaa	It doesn't hurt, but instead, find thin socks or tights. You know when you go inside a shoes store, and you see those tight socks which you use to try shoes on? Get some, and bring them home. |`|Pe4wijKkaa	I looooove ballet flats. And they do hurt for a while, you have to break them in just like any other shoe.

There is a reason that should have stayed dead with the 70s.  Go with a halter-style dress, preferrably one that ends right belw your knees.  It looks less "slutty" and the longer lines of the dress will make you appear taller.
80934f2e2a0f136bbb5b9e24917282b8aa	Haven't seen the video, but you probably are thinking of fingerwaves.  You'd need to have a hairdresser do it for you.  It's done with lots of gel, a comb and fingers.  Finished with pin curls, set under a hair dryer.|`|54zOPgHlaa	I've never seen this video i don't think. But I am wondering if you are talking about finger waving, which was very popular at the time. or if the hairstyle is more of a pixie.<br>  <br>  The finger wave hairstyle was a style that was worn close to the head.  A swished bang to one side of the forehead and crimping of the hair across the skull.  It would be like squeezing the hair between the index and middle finger to form waves in the hair. <br>  <br>  So to do a fingerwave for yourself, wind your hair around the forefinger right to the scalp then hold in place with bobby pins. When the hair dries, take out the pins and comb the curls and leave them fairly close to the head. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://1930s.com/askruthiefaq-fashions.html#hs2" rel="nofollow">http://1930s.com/askruthiefaq-fashions.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_wave" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_wave</a>|`|q7h1JDjUaa	<a href="http://service.forumcommunity.net/" rel="nofollow">http://service.forumcommunity.net/</a>|`|1cwXVsbbaa	Egg whites lay some hair down pretty hard, or a lot of gel mousse, and hairspray|`|UXZAJauyaa	1.

They are very good in controlling skin-oil production.<br>  -Use blotting tissue to wipe away the excess oil.<br>  -Dust some loose powder of your skin tone to absorb the excess oil and remove the shine.<br>  -Drink a lot of water, this cools down the body and reduces excessive sweating which normally causes more oil production.<br>  -Stay away from the sun or direct heat.<br>  -Use evian thermal water spray directly on your face to sooth and cool down the heat on the face.<br>  -Avoid make-up but if u must, use water based type, powder-type or oil-free type especially foundation.

z3Z9BWPSaa	I always believed it and most of my generation does, but I saw a hair expert on Oprah once who said that it's a myth.  She said that if it's so clean, it squeaks, then you have actually over-stripped the natural oils.  Also shampoo doesn't need to lather to do the job, but you do need to rinse AND repeat. By which time, it usually squeaks, so I think you have to judge for yourself by the overall condition of your hair.|`|mkB1e30Paa	pretty sure its does, its 'squeakly clean'|`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	Yes that would be TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  
44435ac38b755e42d6164067b0413d71aa	You need to find a way to value yourself no matter what your weight.  Its very hard to have good self esteem if its based exclusively on how you look or how much you weigh.  And face it, many of us will not conform to an ideal image no matter how thin we get.  I suggest that you find an activity that you will enjoy and will get you socializing with other people who enjoy you.  There are many worthwhile things you could do but you're the only one who knows what they are.  Take some time to think about what you like doing - music, reading, writing, shopping, chatting, sewing, painting, playing with dogs ... the list could go on forever!   Once you have decided on what you enjoy most, try to figure out a way that will take you out of yourself. Like, if you enjoy shopping, find out if there are any elderly people in your community that could use help with their shopping.  Sew a simple quilt to donate to victims of abuse. Volunteer to read aloud for Reading for the Blind.  You can surely find some activity that will make you feel good for having done it.<br>  <br>  If you're still reading, stop right now and go take a walk. No matter what your weight, regular exercise will make you healthier and feel better.  It will help you regulate your weight as well.  At 195, taking off a few pounds would be a good idea, but please don't go on one of those crazy diets!   You'll start seesawing and end up gaining weight.  If you are motivated to change your eating habits, try Weight Watchers.  They've got a reasonable program that will help you reach a healthy (and maintainable) weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your endeavors!  Be well!|`|YkZm5VWhaa	Work to accomplish things you can be proud of.|`|9sejOjSGaa	join a dance class or jog?|`|7906ca32c7dc97ed9fdf40b123608e86aa	Ok do not stress this can be fixed! First get a notebook and start writing down every thing you eat every day. Start buying food that is healthier and cut your portions down. Make sure you don't just go buy "low fat" or "fat free food" those options are not always healthy. Pay attention to the labels of the food you buy, the sodium content, sugar, carbs etc. The more fresh uncooked food you eat the better you will start to feel. Take it one step at a time start by walking even if it is 15 minutes a day. Then gradually build up to harder exercising. YOU CAN DO IT, just put your mind to it. Remember though do not pressure yourself to be stick thin that is just as unhealthy. Good luck|`|7aeda1064c0cee9435ba62f90662559aaa	I suggest working out. a good exercise makes us happy, and healthy, it will help you get your self esteem and help you control your weight. |`|otHTxD1haa	Loose weight?!|`|gaBrIDGAaa	Just get involved in physical activities with the focus on fun. That is all. You will make friends. You will smile more. Because of the physical activity, your body will become stronger and leaner. A dance class or club  is a natural.

lHOmVfaOaa	The girl in the first curly pic looks like she has naturally curly hair.  If your hair is naturally straight, I think the only way for you to get hair like that is to perm it, and I don't think you want to do that.  It looks naturally curly and scrunched, like with a curl spray, mousse, or gel.<br>  <br>  The second one looks like it was curled with hot rollers or a curling iron.  This could be done easily.  Use a curling iron with a small gage if you want curls that tight.|`|I6T4mDPsaa	a hair curler lmao :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  help please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtrhSfY6cHcyNWdBUsnAeaXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080927143724AAS6rix">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0Vdq2hFeaa	I suggest getting some mouse and scrunching your hair after you wash it then once it dries get the hair curler and curl your hair.|`|mCtNERQpaa	What i do is when im done washing my hair i put gel all over in everysingle peace of hair i got n mouse i guess....n i put hair spray till it turns reall hard n ye i crunch t n w.e. it gets hard n stays like dat n l0l its HELL wen i wash it after dat ALOT of my hair falls off n i need to wah it like a million times for the hairsparay to come off l0l|`|tkYrGtQFaa	hairdresser :)|`|wCYq386Faa	with a curling iron would be nice|`|oTJqILPlaa	Well this is what I do, but it might not work for you. I take a shower and use herbal essense totally twisted shampoo ( I doubt it actually brings the curl out but w/e) Then I put a lot of mousse in my hair and scrunch it up a lot.

It actually only takes me about 10 min.|`|ElSnCxg1aa	hmm....<br>  <br>  i would start of with a nice volumizing spray or gel, then let that dry a little while, then take a curling iron (1' barrel) and curl from the very top. and use a lot of non crunch hairspray like, dove hairspray. it should work and hold...<br>  <br>  hope this helped.|`|otocLOPMaa	ur best option is using alotta mousse(DOVE or PAntene) when ur hair is damp after a shower...then braiding it into TWO braids and sleeping on it overnight...dont forget to separate and blowdry ur bangs tho:)..nd wen u get up in the morning...blowdry all ur hair once more just so tht its not still damp(DONT USE A BRUSH EVEN BY ACCIDENT! lol:) nd apply very little serum just so tht it doesnt frizz at all..honestly this really works! |`|N6FJq8Odaa	<a href="http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1838.html?s_cid=biz_A8620" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1...</a>|`|lu1dWGN4aa	curl it with a hair curler for some tips i would recomend this video: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=CWRtOQIaLgo" rel="nofollow">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=CWRtOQIaLg...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|czNooXcnaa	Just get a small curling iron like this one <a href="http://www.folica.com/Infrashine_High_d2246.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Infrashine_High_d2...</a> Spray a lot and have fun|`|867eMGfVaa	the third one will look curly or straight so that one<br>  |`|r2IgKewdaa	rollers...maybe

ZM4FPFFBaa	If you are trying various foundations and are experiencing breakouts/clogged pores; let's look at your skincare first.  <br>  1. Are you removing your makeup completely? Your cleanser might not be strong enough to breakdown all of your foundation, therefore, your skin is not thoroughly clean. You may need a makeup solvent first, then a skin cleanser.<br>  2. Sometimes if your skin is over exfoliated that can cause sensitivity and minor breakouts. Although you are using the Retin-A, are you using another exfoliating agent?<br>  3. Are you using a heavy moisturizer? You may need a lighter or oil free moisturizer.<br>  4. How much foundation are you using on your skin? <br>  <br>  You can also try other foundations too. I would also recommend Clinique b/c it was created fragrance free, which can irritate sensitive skin. Additionally, depending on how much coverage you desire, you can try just using concealer where you need it. <br>  <br>  You have alot of options to explore, but definitely start with your skincare first. I hope this helps you.|`|u0Qt1QLxaa	You might want to try applying a primer before you put foundation on. There are kinds for oily or dry skin. I like the brand Laura Mercier, though there are many other nice ones too. It provides a barrier between your skin and the makeup and yet still allows your skin to breathe. I have oily skin and it absorbs the oil and keeps it from clogging up my pores which results in less acne for me. I first moisturize, then apply the primer and then foundation. If you use the primer you could probably just stick with the almay foundation that you like.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|GHObdosFaa	I agree with elle and also you might want to try bare minerals or bees luscious.|`|2JQDpcZ5aa	use a mineral foundation....! : )|`|mjx9XsfMaa	use foundation that is oil free and non-comedogenic<br>  <br>  I like these two..<br>  Clinique Clairifying Liquid Foundation<br>  Lancome Teint Idole Ultra|`|duIjWVQUaa	go to clinique they have some of thebest foundations around it very light and does not clog pores but yet stays on all day.|`|4dogsIzcaa	Have you tried covergirl?

W9l1Y6pPaa	I haven't tried it. I have CHI. It's awesome.

Be sure to check it out!<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|CkEYJg0daa	I bought a silver bullet over a year ago, beacuse my hairdresser uses one. I think it does a pretty good job and I have quite thick  curly hair and have being using straigteners for the last 5 years. Pros - easy to use, heats up really quickly and does not burn the house down when left on all day accidentally. Cons - digital display of temperature is not quite right - stopped being able to see the temp reading numbers after about a month, but it usually heats to around 180 degrees anyway. Also able to give you a mighty fine burn and blister to show off to your friends. Good luck!

xCFSqbszaa	By thick, I assume you have too much. Shampoos and conditioners are not the way to go at all for this particular problem. I have very curly, thick hair myself and about every four to six weeks when I go to my hairdresser for a trim, she also thins it out for me. There are several ways to thin hair. One is called texturizing, where small notches of hair are cut down close to the scalp to make hair appear thinner. That particular way of thinning also creates a full look though, because the short hairs make the longer ones stand up more. I like that because I have a short, funky style. The most common way of thinning the hair though, is using thinning shears. Just ask your hairstylist to use them during your next trim.  Believe me, it makes a huge difference!|`|VGg5ZERaaa	go to your hair stylist and say you want it thinned!<br>  <br>     guys are such goobers geeze!|`|r5UXYQsKaa	shampoo and conditioner will never help, you'll need to get it thinned out. Go to a salon and ask fo it to be thinned out they'll either use thinning shears or a straight razor.

Elliminate all caffeine or as much as possible from your diet.  ie sodas, chocolate and research other foods with caffeine.<br>  Avoid hot steaming foods.  <br>  Who knows, you might outgrow it.  Your complexion has a lot to do with it.  BTW, do NOT spend time in the sun without real good sun screen.<br>  Do some research on fair complexion.|`|zpd7zgH0aa	I'm a teen and have the exact same problem. You need a good perscription acne medication. I've tried two so far. The first one was this weird cream in a tube... And the one I'm on now is Benzaclin. It helped clear my face up- but it's not quite strong enough for me, so I'm going to get on another medication in a few weeks. Try Dove face wash, I know it might sound girly- but it makes your skin softer and takes away some redness. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|e1a6eec6c5c157761693aa3b09da1523aa	Wait to grow up!<br>  It's naturall because u r teen.

You should really keep both on hand so you can switch up your look.

My husband does not understand why I need 10 different products to, as he puts it, "paint rings around your eyes"!<br>  <br>  Seriously, though, it depends on what effect you want.  If you want something neat - a clean line, nothing beats Mac Fluidline gel liner and it's relatively inexpensive, for something good.  With that you should use a very fine edged liner brush. <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/templates/products/sp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY15101&PRODUCT_ID=PROD7715" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.com/templates/pr...</a><br>  Sephora makes pretty good quality brushes that aren't too expensive:  This one is like I mentioned above.<br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P93610&shouldPaginate=true&categoryId=3902" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <br>  If you want something smudgy, you can use a pencil or cream liner and then use powder liner over it.  The powder liner will darken and soften the line and make it stay on a longer time without bleeding or fading.  I use Cargo Smoky Eye Duo, it has a cream and powder liners in one compact, which is nice and portable.  The Cargo has the best powder liner, but you can also use eyeshadow as powder liner, black or whatever color you want.<br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P112508&categoryId=B70" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  For this, you can use the same kind of brush as above, or a small tipped brush like this<br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P183727&shouldPaginate=true&categoryId=3902" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <br>  If you use a pencil, for speed and convenience, you need a good one that goes on easy and isn't too soft.  Dior is fabulous, <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P0276&categoryId=S10505&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  but Bourjois is great and a little cheaper.   <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P56603&shouldPaginate=true&categoryId=1958" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <br>  If you want liquid. you can use a brush type, which is tricky, but makes a nice, dark line and a perfect cat's eye.  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P55312&categoryId=B70" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  Or you can use a felt tip type which is also good and goes on easier.  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P0277&categoryId=B70" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  Personally, I sometimes use liquid liners, but I don't necessarily recommend them.<br>  <br>  Well, I hope something here helps!

It really depends on your eyes, and how they are set on your face.  If you want check out www.marykay.com/nicoleeasley or go to www.marykay.com and you can find a consultant near you who would be more then willing to do a facial with you.  On the marykay.com site there is a section on the left hand side for make-up tips follow through that link until you find the eye shape tips section and pick the eyes that look closest to yours.

The key to keeping eyeshadow from melting into your eyelid crease as the day goes on is to kept eyelids oil-free. To do this start with an eyeshadow base (also called "primer"). I prefer to dab at bit of MAC's 'paint' on lids before shadow application. Or try Fresh Freshface Perfecting Eye Primer.<br>  <br>  Apply eyeliner. If you're going for a typical black, brown or gray smoky eye, apply liner in one of those colors above the upper lash line, drawing line thicker in the middle of eye. If your opting for a jewel-toned eye (violet makes a gorgeous smoky eye), line eyes with a purple, blue or deep green liner.<br>  <br>  Blend in color on bottom lashes For color on the bottom (a key smoky eye look) you'll want a lighter eyeliner. The key is to "smudge it." You can also apply a bit of shadow to get full smudge effect.<br>  <br>  Apply light base color Again, the key to a smoky eye is pairing a lighter base with the darker hue. I prefer a nice cream shade for my base. Sweep a light, shimmery shadow over the lids to your browbone.<br>                                                                                                            Blend in darker color, but keep dark color below the crease. Now that you have the base and eyeliner on, it's time to get the smoky effect. You need a darker eyeshadow shade. Using an eyeshadow brush blend in color starting at your lash line, blending up. Make sure to blend color into the lash line so the eye liner disappears. Stop deep color at crease. <br>  <br>  Doublecheck your work.<br>  Finish with several coats of volumizing mascara. <br>  Remember to keep lips nude. When applying strong makeup (like smoky eyes or red lips) put the focus on either eyes orlips, never both|`|34425c5a6d3e57de1fa32dc02e18dc06aa	<a href="http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-create-a-smoky-eye-effect" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-crea...</a>|`|f3044ba96c1a159773350effec048b80aa	Try this link (it's safe)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkl3YiswJrE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkl3YiswJ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coloursandscents.co.nz/category/howtoapplyeyemakeupsmokeyeyemakeupguide.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.coloursandscents.co.nz/catego...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that helps.

I would assume though, that you would want to figure out the ingredients for your products buy some supplies and containers from whole salers, a good number of which can be found on the Internet. Make a small number of batches and let people sample them. I don't know if it would be safer to let people you know sample them, because you could get mixed results, when you want honest results that you won't get you sued. You might want to also look into etsy.com or getting a website started up, or buying advertising space on search engines, hair magazines, or hair websites like naturallycurly.com. Then see about selling your stuff on other websites like honeyfig.com, where they sell other people's products. Don't forget to take lots of before and after pictures for potential customers, and if possible list your ingredients for allergy and religious sake. Like for me, for religious purposes, i can't use anything that has gelatin, or any derivative because it's pig fat. Some people may be allergic to nut oils you may use, and so on. <br>  As with any start up venture there is more money to be spent than made in the beginning, but hopefully you can carve out your place in the hair care world.|`|nDOq2L1gaa	take some classes at a salon or start by working at a salon so you know the business|`|mNo10VYbaa	by making ur hair a normal color

jkmjqNvUaa	DO NOT use chemicals on skin. Follow these instructions and i'm sure they will work!<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Put toothpaste on your pimple before you go to bed, should help reduce swelling overnight. Make sure it is the paste not the gel. One of the most popular acne home remedies.<br>  <br>  2. Wash your face twice a day in warm salty water. This should leave your face oil free without aggravating the acne.<br>  <br>  3. Apply a paste of fresh methi (fenugreek) leaves over the face every night for 10-15 minutes and washed with warm water. This will prevent acne, pimples, blackheads, and wrinkles.<br>  <br>  4. Place strawberry leaves on the acne, the alkalinity helps to reduce the swelling.<br>  <br>  5. Extract juice of one lemon and mix with equal quantity of rose water. Apply this mixture on the face and let it stay for about half an hour. Wash the face with fresh water. About 15 days application helps cure acne, pimples and reduces blemishes and scars.<br>  <br>  6. Another method is to massage the face with the skin of lemon before washing with lukewarm water.<br>  <br>  7. Apply fresh mint juice over the face every night for the treatment of acne, pimples, insect stings, eczema, scabies, & other skin infections.<br>  <br>  8. Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. At least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables should be included in your diet. All acne home remedies should include a healthy diet.<br>  <br>  9. A couple of garlic cloves, crushed and dabbed on the face 1-2 times a day. One of the smellier acne home remedies!<br>  <br>  10. Home face wash for acne: Mix together 1 or 2mls each of the following: witch hazel, tea-tree and sweet fennel essential oils, adding essential oil of geranium for women and essential oil of rosewood for men. Mix with 300mls of water. Shake before use, as the oils will float on top of the water during storage. Dab affected areas with cotton wool two or three times a day. The oils will clean and unclog giving antibiotic-like protection to the skin.<br>  <br>  11. Apply fresh lemon juice on the affected area overnight. Wash off with warm water next morning.<br>  <br>  12. Use 2-3 tsp. dried basil leaves to 1 cup boiling water. Steep 10-20 minutes. Cool, and apply with cotton ball.<br>  <br>  13.

This will work for sure, and it's easy!<br>  <br>  1) Run out to a local drugstore [walgreens, cvs, rite-aid] and get Clean&Clear On The Spot Gel Treatment, and St. Ives Apricot Scrub for your face. Also, I reccomend getting Neutrogena Stress Free Acne Wash, because it works really well with the apricot scrub!<br>  <br>  2) Every night, use the apricot scrub. Use a bit more on your forehead, and make sure that you scrub hard!<br>  <br>  3) Then wash your face with the Acne Stress Wash<br>  <br>  4) Dry your face and apply the On The Spot acne gel. <br>  <br>  I promise you if you do this routine every day, the pimple will be gone in 3 days!

But the main reason why agree is because I really don't like the idea of having chemicals poured into your hair.  My youngest brother (who is the only one who uses gel) started to develop white hair (like the old folks) and he's only 17.  Even my dad doesn't have hair like that.  So I can imagine that the same stuff happens with women.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I bet your natural hair color looks a lot nicer than any paint job.  If you're not happy with your hair, just try a different style.  So I say don't do it.|`|PWDLScfTaa	You should do it and when your roots grow out, just redye the top part. Its what I do.!

91e218230210fb07d7ecda239606673caa	The promise of this eye cream was great - I suffer from dark shadows under my eyes and have to disguise them with make up. I have been using Eyevive for approximately for nearly 8 weeks now, and the skin around my eyes looks fresher and smoother, the dark circles have reduced, and the skin appears less fragile and more 'plump'.<br>  <br>  When I apply the eye cream it feels cool and soothing on my skin, and is very easily absorbed. I have extremely dark, drawn-in eyes caused by years of very little sleep. I'm in my mid-twenties and I've been using eye creams since I was 18, constantly changing brands in my search for one that really works.  I use the product each morning and before I go to bed, and I'm only just finishing the bottle, so it's great value for money. I highly recommend this eye cream.|`|3c508114e9430fa1b87099d4f625c12faa	Eyevive Is the best eye product that i have ever used. I love it!|`|tRV4JHGoaa	I bought this product for the first time about four months ago and I have been been using it faithfully since then. I probably have used nearly every over the counter skin cream, and basically wasted money! I saw this Eyevive product  featured on a news program and I figured why not try it.  I can honestly say the product works! The product It has diminished the appearance of my dark circles and eye wrinkles, and some are so light i can no longer even see them anymore! I would recommend this product to any woman struggling with dark eye circles, and tired looking eyes! Try it, you too will love it!

leRmjdSEaa	I would suggest adding layers to your hair and possibly doing some that will frame your face. If you go with highlights I would say a honey brown would look best. You can use this website for some great ideas on different trends and styles. <a href="http://www.hair-styles.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hair-styles.org/</a> If you find a style you like make sure you print a copy of it then bring it in with you to the stylist so there is no miscommunication. If you do home highlighting you will need to go to your local beauty supply store (Sally Beauty Supply is the best if you have one close) get the mix from there for honey tones rather than the blonde kits that are sold at your local drug store, these kits on dark hair tend to make the streaks more of a reddish unless you keep them on for a very small amount of time just long enough to slightly lift the color.|`|263f0e7bc616640ce127cfd0909dd6c1aa	cut it a little shorter          make it a little brighter  if u can   n then out like redish brownish more red streaks in their   itssss sooososososoo prettty  PS I LIKE THE RED N WHITE POLKA DOTS SHIRT  ITS CUTE|`|CkPQCZqpaa	Lover, your very very pretty. (:<br>   Also, i love your hair colour. <br>  I think you should layer it, and maybe get straight down bangs, or side bangs, that are a bit thicker. <br>  Also, rainbow colours underneath the bottom of your hair would look really cool, or your favourite colours. (:<br>   good luck hun !|`|AY6kI43yaa	Hmm maybe a light brown or a dark red not to red or a dark blonde would look really nice ^^|`|Ds5FL7HMaa	Caramel or dark blonde whats on your leg it looks like a hermit crab|`|NzkMAqzlaa	I would agree with framing your face. Right to about the check bone would be pretty. You could do long layers if it is done right the layers will blend when you want them to but you can bring them out if you want them more dramatic using curling iron or curlers. Highlights I would not go dramatic on just enough to brighten your hair. You can do slight amount of beige, honey blonde, Carmel would be pretty also. Do a little bit of highlighting underneath first to get use to it then add more. Also if you want something brighter and different. Why not trying having it colored a red. A heather red, something that is about two levels lighter. Go to a professional to have any of this done. Good luck!|`|oNzlHS0Raa	blonde...

I have been to numerous dermatologists and my doctor to no avail. One thing i can tell you is dont be conned by all the hype surrounding a cream called tetrasil, in a moment of utter desperation i bought this product on line and i can honestly say it was worse than useless.  It seemed to be the miracle product with great reviews but it done nothing at all for me.  I am so desperate for a cure, ive tried all the creams from my doc n dermatologist, ive had antibiotics and loads of other lotions and potions, this really upsets me!

6POUSfVPaa	There are many heat protectants out there, but no a straightener doesn't make your hair fall out. It's not that damaging if you use a heat protectant. I used to straighten my long hair every day for like a year and when I went to get a haircut I asked the hairdresser if it was bad that I was doing that, and she said my hair looked healthy. Just make sure you're using some kind of repairing or moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and a heat protectant:<br>  <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.jsp?CATID=304571&navAction=jump&navCount=0&skuid=sku3120355&id=prod3121522" rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.jsp?CATID=304641&navAction=jump&navCount=0&skuid=sku3120354&id=prod3121521" rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.jsp?CATID=304670&navAction=jump&navCount=3&skuid=sku1678988&id=prod1679001" rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.jsp?CATID=100652&navAction=jump&navCount=3&skuid=sku3867905&id=prod3869056" rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...</a><br>  =]|`|qcYiVoocaa	you won't go bald, but if your worried about damaged hair make sure to get a ceramic flat iron and use a heat protector spray/gel, there are serveral out there you can find in the drug or grocery store.|`|IpCHsTf7aa	If you use a flat iron everyday. But I got my hair straightened once with chemicals, and I've never had a single split end. The straightening lasts 7 months- a year.|`|gmNldWs5aa	Definitely. It can damage it. But also a blow dryer will damage your hair. It depends on how often you use the hot iron.|`|f37YlA5saa	if you mean chemical straightening...then there is a chance.<br>  but if you mean using a flat iron..i dont think it will make you go bald. However, your hair will be very dry!|`|k9c79PRJaa	Try using Treseme heat protective spray or something like that before you straighten it.

5Hw0lhN3aa	If you wash your skin too much (more than twice a day) your oil glands overreact and produce even more oil. Try using a clay mask.|`|jFtYvGv4aa	It could be because of the make-up you are using, when I used this certain type of concealer all over my face the other day, it became so oily, when I used blot paper on my face, so much excess oil came out.

But don't wash your face TOO much cause you get more oil. Go to the nearest pharmacy or talk to a dermatologist.|`|4vOBicGCaa	Make sure you don't wash your face too much, it will irritate it and make it more oily.

zFfcl7VBaa	Personally, I wouldn't use anything except department store make-up on a regular basis. Drug store make-up is fine if you just want to mess around with something cheap and have fun mixing and matching, but it's poor quality and will damage your skin in the long run.<br>  <br>  I'm a fan of Shiseido for all my basics, like my foundation, powder, mascara, and skin care products. They don't have much of a selection when it comes to color, but they have some cute, light pink lipstick. I like the Lancome liquid eyeliner more than the Shiseido liquid eyeliner though, because Lancome has a felt tip whereas Shiseido has a brush. If you're a fan of pencil eyeliner, Dior is excellent. Depending on your age and preferences, Mac is the way to go when it comes to eyeshadow. They have a huge selection, and the quality is good. In my opinion, the quality of Mac eyeshadow isn't as good as some more expensive brands, but they have a much broader selection of colors.<br>  <br>  Even if these brands are kind of pricey, they're worth it because they last a long, long time. I go through a tube of eyeliner and mascara in about a year, and I usually have to throw out my eyeshadow and lipstick because they get too old before they actually run out. Shiseido's skin care products are the only things that you will actually use up in a hurry ($100 jar in 3 months), but they're completely worth it for the miracle they do on your skin.|`|0Up0j4x5aa	Eyeshadow is probably MAC or Hip or Urban Decay Cosmetics<br>  Mascara - I like Cover girl<br>  Lipgloss - I like Covergirl and Rimmel<br>  Foundation - Have no clue<br>  Blush- Covergirl..<br>  My opinion..<br>  |`|a9g7HG36aa	I really like loreal mascara, it really does make your eye lashes longer and fuller. dont use maybelline though, its not that great...|`|AJjSEXVbaa	Bee Luscious baby!<br>  <br>  It excels in everything they it make!

I choose not to wear makeup and always dress appropriately yet people who are not previously aware of my age are shocked to hear that I am only 14.

At just one year this is especially not normal since the inner-lock is still soft and not fully locked yet. You need to keep your locks moisturized. I use pure virgin olive oil (you can also dilute it, and use it in a spray bottle). Rub it on each lock, root to tip at least once a week. It sounds like you also need to use a hot oil treatment in your hair. Ask your loctitian about that next time you go. Dreadlocks are naturally very strong if they are healthy.  |`|etWY35Z8aa	it's normal

My uncle dyed a piece of my mothers<br>  hair bright orange the night before my grandfathers funeral. (her hair is almost white so the orange really stuck out) It might be ok to wear skinny jeans, and theese days its not strictly black clothing unless <br>  you come from a ritzy family or the deceased is a big wig at a company .(then its suits and ties) you should ask another family member.|`|2qEgeS0Caa	I know your intentions are good but wearing black skinny leg jeans would be too casual for a funeral. I don't think its considered disrepectful but I would find something more dressy than casual. Typically funerals are all black but times have changed. I've worn neutral colors. Just don't wear anything bright. Try something pastel or neutral.<br>  |`|lObEjUh1aa	seriously, it's a funeral; unless you look either outlandish or like a slob, no one is going to be thinking about your clothes.  i don't think casual clothes will be noticed as long as you look nice and presentable.|`|zaFPhdM1aa	Well I would say no to the black skinny leg jeans, but you don't have to wear black clothing to a funeral anymore.  Many people wear other colours, but its best not to be too "bright."|`|APMgWt4Caa	I think you should wear whatever you feel comfortable in.

OgQOVsxPaa	Hey hun, I was wondering the same thing until I went to a hairdressers in my local area. There they sold all the Bed Head range by Tigi, and also sold the GHD straighteners too.

You can wear long loose curls in your hair.<br>  <br>  Do you like to wear your hair up or down? If up wear it up in a nice updo (not being silly) have you though about wearing your hair like Sarah Palin? I like that hair do a lot.|`|Ar04Qd9Waa	Its necessary for you to know your face shape, as this determines what type of styles  would be suitable for your face contours, facial features and so on. I copied this info from Urban Restyles forum page, but it can also relate to those using natural hair too.<br>  <br>  Finding that perfect wig is not always as easy as it sounds. Every woman needs to feel happy about her look without thinking twice. Having the ideal wig takes all the worry that comes with bad hair days away; having a repertoire of these wigs further sweetens the deal! For this reason Urban Restyle breaks down the keys to identifying the perfect wig. With the help of a selection of wigs from Urban Restyle.com (<a href="http://www.urbanrestyle.com)," rel="nofollow">http://www.urbanrestyle.com),</a> we break down the fundermentals and showcase must have looks. In order to understand how to go about picking the right wig, you must look at your facial shape and bone structure. There are basically 7 face shapes and one is yours:<br>  <br>  "Oval"- This facial structure can wear any design with flair. Bobbed, layered, close or full, long or short, just about any style will suite this facial shape.<br>  <br>  "Heart"- This shape needs a softer, curlier style. A chin-length look is perfect. The objective is to create width around the narrow chin. The best looks are full - curly, wavy and bouncy.<br>  <br>  "Pear" - This shape focuses on a full crown at the top to create symmetry with a wide jaw. Layered looks like 110TYWig flatter the pear shape. Tucking the hair behind the ear can draw attention to the cheek structure.<br>  <br>  "Diamond" - To balance a narrow chin one must consider a round nape for fullness at the bottom. Wide and wispy bangs are an option that helps create the illusion of an oval look. A great look is a bob that falls to the chin. Try a wispy design to soften the edges.<br>  <br>  "Square" - Soften the edges of a square-shape face by directing soft wavy bangs down over your temples. For short styles try to keep hair-styles round and soft with height at the crown.<br>  <br>  "Round" - The goal is to create an oval appearance and lift the face. Keep the sides close to the face and promote height at the crown. Look for classic moden styles. A layered shag is perfect for a round face.<br>  <br>  "Rectangle" - Select styles with more volume and width as in 105TYWig or 104TYWig if seeking a shorter style. Bangs look great when touching the brows and help to shorten a long shape face.<br>  <br>  Hope you find styling your hair a little easier at least now!
b02VSoTLaa	I had gel painted nails for some time and it was really good, it looks like you could have got an infection from when you were having them redone.    Try getting some Tea Tree cream or oil and putting on and under your nails and this should clear up any infection you have.|`|A5QItPhHaa	have no idea|`|J1stiMioaa	it is not common, especially if your friend has a infection. if you both used the same technician DONT use them again, she doesnt sound very good or hygienic|`|Gh8918f1aa	You should have it checked out, before you get infected. Lack of hygiene and improper application can caused this. <br>  You shouldn't get this result at all, it should be nice looking nails. <br>  Another suggestion go to a different salon, usually you don't get that with gel nails, an Im amazed your friend and you got it. 
jQHzRWZQaa	what you need to do is buy hair spray, it doesn't have to be expensive but use hairspray not gel. my personal opinion i think gel is messy and hard to get out of your hair. then you use a comb brush with the small bristles and tease the back of your hair and to make it stay you use hair spray. Teasing is backcombing you hair!|`|iQm26W8Maa	hair wax!!!!<br>  make sure its water-based tho...|`|lu8gj7aGaa	got2b defiant pomade|`|0uQLiwUDaa	Go to a hair salon.<br>  You need the pros for a pro look like that.|`|2VsTkx8Vaa	bring in that picture to a salon<br>  and ask them to cut it with a razor blade and to create choppy layers.<br>  you should probably get some modeling clay or wax to set the style <br>  just play around with your hair til it looks about right |`|qKPX3baqaa	gel and teasing.<br>  but you might need to invest in something expensive.<br>  <br>  you might even want to try revlon's water wax.|`|j5Jz0ZeFaa	i use shockwaves gel, its good and lasts for aggges.|`|DgYemoexaa	bed head  love that gel (=

3leKd11Iaa	I think Pink underwear is adorable! And you can usually get them 5 for $25 which is not expensive at all considering the quality, the variety of different styles, and cute prints. I think the line is targeted mainly at 16-20 year olds. You have to be 18 to work at even the separate Pink store (you can't be 16) because some of the underwear and bras are still considered sexy! You are not too old to be buying it, don't worry! I still see plenty of women who are even in their late 20s shopping at the Pink store, you're fine.|`|fPih2EpOaa	No. My friend wears that line of clothing and so do some other girls I go to school with. You're not too old, gosh. That girl must have been on a "put-down" strike or something. Haha. But seriously, underwear that I've bought has been so much more than that. Well, about $3 more. But still. No that is not expensive. Don't listen to that girl. She's just a girl that thinks she's better than everyone. The world has a lot of those, indeed. : P|`|dca3492c95238e6a5a41ea7efdb3a899aa	I was thinking at first that you might be a little young to wear their underwear... <br>  <br>  But, I just peeked through my latest VS catalogue, and in my opinion their PINK line is perfect for a woman your age! It's sexy, but in a really fresh and cute way. Also, five pairs for $25 is a great bargain, because you sound like you're a little too stylish to wear those ten for $6.99 sets you can get at Wal-Mart and Target. (Not that I have anything against those, either.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|qHawajU9aa	Victoria Secret underwear is a little bit pricey some people would rather spend 25 dollars on something else and 18 is deffenitly not too old to wear the pink line its made for teenagers up to about your mid 20's ignore your friends and buy what you like because its you thats going to be wearing it.|`|quzT5sSfaa	No!! You're never too old to wear them idk what your friend is talking about. Ok i mean maybe if your like 30 but 18 is fine! They are soo cute i love the pink stuff too! And i don't think 5 for 25 is expensive at all compared to the reugular vicky's secret stuff, like the regular ones are usually around 15 bucks each, sometimes more. 5 bucks is cheap|`|yKBI9N1Uaa	No, I don't think 18 is too old for PINK. There's no age limit--I'm pretty sure it's actually geared towards people of that age anyways.  From teens to young adults, that's my opinion anyways.  As for the price, it's not a bad price.  Besides, you should buy what you feel comfortable in and what you like and don't listen to what other people have to say.  Hope this helps! :)|`|UqwDMuIqaa	You shouldn't be persuaded by someone else's opinion, its your underwear you want it pink then have it pink, if she wants to wear a thong thats her issue. And they're not that expensive being a designer label. <br>  <br>  ps. i think theyre pretty cute :P |`|Y1IoAugVaa	I don't think they are that expensive....I mean yeah if you want to buy your underwear from walmart it's a lot cheaper...but...I think Victoria Secret has cute underwear. <br>  Idk, I'm 18 and I shop in the Pink Section so I don't think your too old. |`|qaFyHbFoaa	uhmm.. no that girl is probably just jelous no offince and no their not expensive also my mom is 47 and wears them lol trust me your not to lold to wear those and they are not ugly i think their realy cute so dont let it bother you !!! =)|`|iXIcfvIPaa	Okay im obsessed with victoria secret! <br>  These friends of yours sound like they have some bad underwear taste\<br>  And no you are not too old to wear PINK underwear! I would like to hear there alternative to shop!  Stick to your guns you have great taste|`|XFVUejr4aa	No your not too old! Your at the perfect age! 18 19 early Twenties and thirties the prime time to be your sexiest. if you spend less than $5 for a pair of underwear your really not getting quality or your buying granny panties. |`|LI6BdvbMaa	No... i think it is totally fine... a lot 18-30 yr olds wear victoria secrets underwear|`|ef6Jt237aa	5 for 25 isn't bad at all <br>  and 18, uh no ! <br>  ha my mom is 32 and she wears their underwear.<br>  don't worry bout it[:|`|jxkbrTsyaa	Too old?  She sounds jealous with that comment.  VS has lots of styles, and I know ladies in their 50's who love their line.  Underwear can make a girl feel really sexy and feminine.  I love pretty things too.  I don't think $5 a pair is a lot if you can afford it.  I personally have not been happy with the quality of some of their things; and I love a bargain, so I tend to raid the discount stores like TJ Maxx for Lily of France which I personally love, and would be $15 a pair at a specialty store.  But, it's all about what you like and makes you feel good.  You are not too old:  Unless VS is now catering to toddlers. LOL.|`|rn304bSsaa	Personally i don't think anyone is ever too old to wear Victoria's secret. People are cruel and judge by age and stereotype by looks because they have a pink line that promoted by pictures of young girls. who cares. People like fashion and style themselves differently, so no if i were you i wouldn't care what anyone says what you like and don't like, shes not a real nice friend if she cant respect your style. Their not expensive either when they have their blowout sale, 5 for $25 is $5 a pair, that's cheap hope i helped(:|`|RI9itLSRaa	No way! I love their panties! They're so cute looking and not expensive at all. My sisters nineteen and she also wears them and loves them. Almost all the girls I know, as well as my sisters friends wear them.I don't know what that girl was talking about, because Victorias Secret is really popular for this age group and even older :) |`|jTkX9HJyaa	I thought the pink line was fine for girls at your age who are also going to college and stuff<br>  because of the whole varsity look!<br>  <br>  anyways, i love their line too, i have tons of pink's underwear and i love 'em|`|bd15f3fb92086e6fbaddee4b97b19fdeaa	Victoria's  secret underwear is a little expensive. i mean you can probably find the same underwear you buy so much cheaper at walmart. but if you like go ahead and buy, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  but being too old, i don't think you are. victoria secret isn't a store for little teenyboppers. its a store for women. and since your 18 and im 18 and i shop there sometimes i think we're old shopping there. your friend doesn't know what she's talking about.|`|WngxQDiaaa	No! Your friend is wrong.  5 pairs of underwear for $25 is a good deal. They can be expensive but if you buy on their sales you can get some good deals.  I am in my 30's and I buy underwear there. I don't think anyone is too old to wear Victoria Secret underwear.  |`|TJTB6PJhaa	OK, that is so NOT expensive for underwear. Thats so cheap. I mean, Calvin Klein underwear is like, $10 for ONE. And no, you are not too old to be wearing their PINK underwear. My MOM still does and she's older than you.|`|iLaot5T5aa	You are SO not too old at all! I work at VS and see women in their 40's coming in wearing PINK tracksuits and buying all sorts of PINK stuff for themselves!|`|a58583c7851d0c22aa032fedc182b3eaaa	I think this is just a personal preference here, some people say ur too old and its too expensive, and others say its all good. So your freind is just one of those poeple who opposes it. Personally, I think its fine for you to be wearing the pink line(but when you turn 21 get them somewhere else) Also, $25 is not expensive. So its up to you and your taste, and since you thought it was fine to wear them and buy them, then its fine. The only opinion that matters here is yours:d|`|YuW1wJ6iaa	First of all, you shouldn't care what other people think.<br>  <br>  Second of all, you are definitely not too old to be wearing the Pink line. You are 18! If you wanted to you could buy lingerie but maybe you don't want to. So don't feel self-conscious about your undies.<br>  <br>  Lastly, they aren't that expensive. There are cheaper brands out there but 5 for $25 is a good deal considering you save about $2 on each pair.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|rmnvkIBXaa	1. your friends friend sounds like a jerk<br>  2. your underwear is yours, nobody else will even see it unless you let them, so who cares what it looks like? wear what makes you comfortable.<br>  3. I dont think victorias secret makes KIDS underwear.<br>  4. 5 for $25 isnt expensive for nice underwear.|`|AA12091262	no....<br>  not at all<br>  Victoria's Secret wasn't meant for ''little girls'' anyway. Its a lingerie store for goodness sake<br>  <br>  so to answer your question, no your not too old at all!<br>  <br>  Katrina|`|YCeI6auxaa	yes you are too old for pink but not too old for normal victoria secret and 5 for $25 is too expensive.|`|eP44A21Oaa	At 18 I think you are too old for the pink line.<br>  <br>  But I love them.  And they aren't expensive- she must be a cheap person.|`|cnSarPWwaa	they are insane thats the only place i get my underwear its adorable and its comfty its not that badly priced|`|kkM8vFfKaa	Wow nooo way. I'm 18 and I absolutely love Victoria's Secret. Don't listen to your idiotic friends. They shouldn't chastise you for wearing Victoria's Secret underwear. I see middle-aged women in there allllll the time. Heck, I've even seen maybe a couple of 50-year-old women in that store. It shouldn't matter what your friends think. As for price, I think VS's underwear are reasonably priced as they are super durable (I get the 5 for $25 deal, also). I hate underwear that call for having to hand wash in the sink. Ew. I just wanna throw them in the washer like the rest of my clothes, okay? And that's what I can do with any of my VS underwear. Also, they're super comfortable, and cute. Don't listen to what anyone else says.<br>  :)

In the summer and winter, it's just a way of feeling clean and refreshed right after you take a nice warm shower to throw on a pair of clean PJ's and go straight to sleep.|`|knyjNiy0aa	i keep my doors cracked so the cats can come and go. but i dont like it completely open because i dont like seeing into the hallway at night. it make me feel better<br>  <br>  and i sleep in pjs cause i sleep with my door cracked and im not the only one in my household.. i dont want anyone peeking in on me|`|HdSaN24caa	i'm a light sleeper and hear everything at night, i keep the bed room door open and you better not be breaking in. also have a dog in the house.|`|mu94enaVaa	i sleep with my door closer because otherwise my dog runs out of my room and i like having my dog in my bed because she is warm and snuggely and makes me feel safe.

oVxr5B3Eaa	Make sure it's dry and try latex gloves. Don't try to hold it with your teeth. They're a really big pain when you first get them because the piercer puts them on as tight as they possibly can. You'll likely need to either have a friend help you (if you'll let someone put their gloved hand in your mouth) or go back to the piercer. <br>  Same thing happened to my friend and it took even the PIERCER about 15 mins to get it off.. But sometimes it's the only way. |`|TqG6v6ZKaa	when i change my lip studs i actually bite down on the inside part of the ring and hold it as sturdy as possible and then twist the ball/spike/star/diamond/whatever you have on haha. <br>  if that doesn't work. head over to a tattoo parlor. they'll help you out and wont charge you.  |`|83014dad37540bc0298b07bf30f67c6eaa	Try drying it off with a kleenex or paper towel, and make sure your hands are dry as well.  Possibly use latex/vinyl gloves.  Make sure you are tryig to get the front to turn, not the back..  If you are still unable to get it off, go see a piercer so you do not cause anymore irritation to the piercing trying to remove it.  Good luck!|`|NrGiSfBpaa	You could ask someone else to help and if that dosent work i would go to a piercing place and they could get it off for you.

fb4e1ec9959190eaa9b0de08c38f728faa	The previous member answered your question very well. I apply the powder eyeliner with an angled brush but stopped using it because everytime I sneezed, the small particles would scatter onto my eyelid!!! Plus it pigments your skin. Gel liner is applied with an angled brush.  I have used bobbi brown and mac but I prefer bobbi brown as its thicker. Gel liners can also be used to line the inside of your eyes (making them appear bigger). Again bobbi brown is better as its visible and lasts. Liquid eyeliner is the quickest to apply. I use l'oreal superliner.  I suggest bobbi brown gel eyeliner.  You can't go wrong with that. With the liquid you'll have to try and test to see which works the best and which has the best 'eye wand'.|`|uUwgyOuNaa	your not going to know which one is best until you obviously try them! hello|`|MleSKbp4aa	Cream liner, as the name suggests, is a liner with a creamy base and texture, it is applied with an angled brush. Liquid liners are a more wet, ink type of liner, they can be applied with a brush or come in wands or texta style tips. Gel liners are more natural, they are of a gel-like texture and applied with a brush. Powder liners are basically very highly pigmented powders, that can be applied with a wet brush. <br>  <br>  I like MAC for all of these products. However, I would suggest Napoleon Pedris Charcoal Liner for powder. 
SMisVA6Qaa	Try Clinique Moisturizing Tint....it is great for sensitive skin, gives you a glowing color without making you look like your makeup is caked on.  And I think it even has SPF in it, which is very important. Wear your mineral powder over the moisturizing tint or wear it alone.|`|3Ep8U7gvaa	i would always say m.a.c products are really nice and last long.<br>  they cost around $30<br>  also if you want a cheaper brand i found that rimmel works good, but i'd still say m.a.c. is the best. and you can just apply with your fingers with give a natural look. <br>  also m.a.c. adds sunscreen to their foundation, i think its 20 spf though, which isnt bad. <br>  heres the link to m.a.c. make up for the face so you can have the link to concealer no problem.|`|PtvaAA5Baa	i absolutley love mary-kays make up its great and doesnt clump!!<br>  try this site marykay.com/tammy48<br>  and you can buy the foundation brush wow does it make ulook good haha:)<br>  its also in your price range:)|`|PQBEqS8Caa	Try the MAC mineralize skin finish. It has medium coverage and it looks nice and dewey.<br>  Another choice is mac tudio fix fluid and set it with some Mineralize skin finish. The SFF will give a matte look but the MSF will give a nice glow.|`|xiNdQjoaaa	Revlon colourstay liquid foundation is great. It does not dry matt, rather leaving a more natural, dewy finish. It is non-comedogenic and is around $30, maybe a little more.

zmjAccMFaa	You can get an infection with either, it is all in how YOU take care of it.<br>  But you are less likely to get one if you get it done with a needle.<br>  Guns can still have bacteria and blood born pathogens on them.  Needles are completely sterile.<br>  Yes if you get it done with a needle you have no chance of it shattering your cartilage.  The reason a gun can shatter it is because of the pressure and blunt force used to force the jewelry into your ear.<br>  The needle leaves an actual hole for the jewelry.<br>  <br>  To add to it.<br>  If you get it done with a needle you will be at a professional shop.  Here people know what they are doing and have had years of training on how to do piercings correctly.<br>  Places that use a gun have only a few hours or days of training.<br>  Professional parlors also use the correct types of jewelry.<br>  Getting it done with a needle is actually way less painful than a gun :]<br>  <br>  So the best way to get any piercing is with a needle.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	had my ear pierced in the upper cartilage...BAD infection.

(i'm not a 100% accurate) but from what i read is that your going into that path. what can help you is talking to other guys who are in the same situation as you....trust me you're not alone...there's other people who do the same thing....seek advice from them.|`|ScXOIIwfaa	dude ur just like isis on americas next top model! =]

L3j2HrsJaa	I would also love to find a cream that prevents tanning. I heard that in Japan they invented some sunblock that actually prevents tanning completely, but I couldn't get any information on this. So the only option is to wear the highest spf possible and reapply every 2 hours during the day. Also try to wear a hat, long sleeves and long pants as much as possible. Big sunglasses are also a must. I use Bioderma spf 100 on my face and Nivea 50+ on my body. But if I stay in the sun long enough, I'll tan nevertheless. |`|AA10720479	Sunblock|`|HR6wT7ojaa	sunscreen with a high spf.|`|6yK9aFWOaa	sunblock try spf 40+<br>  man they work so well<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av3UuFf2k0EGRab_S2saNC_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081109174923AATOK5P">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|FkDf11AJaa	nivea face wash<br>  
G13DBUcUaa	I think they are all really cute outfits, but the first and third one stick out the most to me. The skirt might be a little short, but hey, you said you wanted to impress. lol. For the last outfit you, could also wear a pair of uggs to make it a casual look, or a pair of flats would look cute.|`|bhOiEMvpaa	None. Stay away from Abercrombie and such. It's just the name on the tag that's cute. THE CLOTHES THEMSELVES ARENT CUTE.|`|5208Mo8baa	I prefer 5 over 4. It depends on if it's day or night. For night, 5 would work best. I would pair black or gold flats with it. No heels.|`|oBdlGYukaa	4 its cute but not to overboard. as for 1-3 what is with you and jeans that look like they came out of a trash can? |`|c9B6uWlDaa	3rd or 4th|`|Dc52cZz0aa	I would say eitehr 1st one or the 4th one :]|`|aErgE3WPaa	o-o;; how do you afford all that a & f. o-o;; ok anway. out of all of those i like the first one best.|`|KjGWUlKKaa	you have great taste!!!!<br>  i likked the first and 2nd(:<br>  cuz thats like my style and stuff(:|`|M4qBR1KOaa	i have to say, u paired up the clothes pretty well:) I like the 3rd one with the mini shirt and uggs. that's really cute.

Then take a gold or bronze color and sweep it across your lashes. Then just on the outside corners of your eyes apply a thin line of eyeliner and curve it up and out just a little on the ends. Then also apply the liner underneath your bottom lash line. Curl your eyelashes and apply mascara focusing on the outsides of the lashes! good luck:)|`|059c8e9ed15218addeab6ccf3a7eb2a0aa	Use eyeliner to suit your eyes, BUT only use it on the outside of the eye and not all the way round either.. just use it in the far corner. If you're blonde and fair skinned don't use black eyeliner! I find brown is good. If you have blue eyes don't wear blue eye shadow or eye liner as is reflects the blue off of your eyes and therefore makes them look less blue... Green is nice. <br>  When using eye shadow, put a darker shade of the colour you're using on the outer side of your eye lid to make your eye look bigger and a bit of shimmer on the other side looks great. <br>  Use one of those 2 in 1 mascara's.. the one with one white end and one black/brown end... really boosts your lashes :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Jenny x|`|rNwEthqLaa	try using an eye shadow that  compliments your eye color. also use white eyeliner inside your eyes to brighten them up, which will make them look bigger. You can also use a highlighting shadow on the corner of your eye and on your brow bone to give the illusion of lifting the eye. Don't be afraid to play with colors, especially with eye liner! good luck! =)|`|djnE97PAaa	TIP: Using eyeliner to line the top of the lids<br>  make the eyes look bigger because of the<br>  enhanced lash line. A little bit on the bottom<br>  contrasts your eyes more. As for shadows<br>  as long as you know how to blend well, then<br>  any color used can make your eyes look 10X<br>  bigger. Google up some images of celebrities<br>  or normal people and see how they do their<br>  make up. Look up some videos and tutorials<br>  on how to line the lashes etc. Good luck!|`|btRpMJVYaa	if you have small eyes. do not use eyeliner because they make your eyes look smaller. stick to mascara , apply lots of mascara and it will make your eyes look bigger. use a light skin toned eyeshadow around your eyes and it will make your eyes stand out and appear bigger. i have small eyes and this is what i do. i get complimented on my eyes alot now :)|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	try not to use eyeshadow as much. but if you must then use really light light colors and not too much either. <br>  <br>  a good eyeliner would be other light colors such as light purple, pink , light brown, white, green depending on your outfit or colored eyes<br>  <br>  and wear mascara to make your eyelashes look fuller and darker, thus making your eyes stand out much more|`|6G47mC9Taa	apply a dark eye shadow on underneath the eye brow n light eye shadow on the eye |`|TkWf8Ywmaa	Rimmell Mascara & concealer around the eyes.

gkUOBRj4aa	1. It's fine and cute, but you can try different hairstyles. You're hair looks short, so leave your bangs out and try some small and cute braids or pigtails? (Just 2) You can put half up also, or take 2 sections from the front of both sides and pull them back or a little bit up. Not sure if you know what i'm talking about, though. You're hair color is great the way it is, but you can dye it red if you want to try something different. Make sure it has a little bit of brownish tones in it, though. Also, I like your hairstyle in the 2nd picture.<br>  <br>  2. You look...16, 14/15, 16 (it's the same picture), and 15-17. So overall, 14-16.<br>  <br>  3. I can't really tell what you look like, because of the poses and angles. But from what I see, ya, you're pretty. <br>  <br>  4. 7 or 8<br>  <br>  5. I don't like your poses in the 1st and last picture, but I like the one in the 2nd picture. It's my favorite, haha. You seem really friendly and nice, maybe shy, but kind of active and playful...you know? A little outgoing, but still nice.<br>  <br>  6. I like what you're using. The eyeliner reminds me of my friend; she puts on this aqua eyeliner around her eyes and it's bold, but gorgeous and works with her. She has green eyes, too, but a brighter shade. I like your eyeliner with you. It's all icy.<br>  <br>  7. Hm...not sure. That's it =]<br>  <br>  Oh, and you DO NOT look 11.|`|qzPzwXkraa	1.) nooo definatly noo red grow it out until like a little passed shoulders and cut (not much) in layers<br>  <br>  2.) you look like from 14ish till 17 or 16ish<br>  <br>  3.) u r pretty - stop wearing sunglasses and show off your realllllllyyy prettyy eyes!!<br>  <br>  4.) from a 1-10, a 9 or 10 (being honest)<br>  <br>  5.) idk i get multiple vibes idk y but maybe ghetto but the soft and pretty and cool to hang out wit!<br>  <br>  6.) noo major makeup- maybe just a little eyeliner and mascara (get stuff that will bring you eyes- their gorgeouse!!!!)<br>  <br>  7.) be you. you look like you have a beutifull personalitly and use it. life is too short to be worring about things. be yourself and love yourself!!<br>  have fun!!|`|CxN4ZNPLaa	1. your hair is stunning leave it the way it is just use a little anti frizz <br>  2. you look 15 , 16<br>  3. yes your gourgez lol<br>  4. on the scale from 1-10being the prettiest youd be a 10<br>  5. you kinda look like an inner person and like emo lol <br>  6. use less eye liner but i think you look cute<br>  7. your gourgez do your hair with anti frizz |`|w0ZGxfJJaa	Don't dye it red!

Too me, you like a nice girl with maybe a cutesy-loving style? Or maybe a rainbow-loving style?<br>  6. Hmm, I'm not really sure, because I can't really see your whole face. Put a full face picture up if you want make-up advice.|`|DNhQD0hRaa	1. I think you should grow it out definitly<br>  no red!<br>  maybe dye it auburn-ish<br>  2. You look 15<br>  3.

t1zWa5vHaa	Your metabolism caught up with your eating habits ;-) It happens all the time! Just eat healthier, and exercise often.|`|OHfZFR31aa	That's typical in most women as we age. Your hormone levels and metabolism change and one day you realize you can no longer eat whatever you want without gaining weight.|`|hCgTGDR8aa	i wasn't a model, but an athlete. <br>  i gained a lot of weight my sophomore year of college, after buying a car and working out less.<br>  <br>  Before i was used to working out (cardio, strength training, yoga, etc.) about 2-3 hours a day, 5-6 days a week (min). i went from that to just half an hour a day 3-4 days a week, and went from a size 8 to a 14!!!<br>  <br>  I went down to a size 10 before getting pregnant (in march). Now i'm just waiting to pop so i can go back to my rigorous exercise routine.<br>  <br>  So just like my body is used to heavy exercise (or at least that's what works for me and makes me feel good), maybe your body was used to a certain diet or style, you just have to figure out what that was i guess. <br>  <br>  The book "skinny b!t ch" might help too. i've been vegan for over a year now and feel great.

WBmuS8kUaa	Attraction through the senses, if you were not pleasing to his sense of smell, he would not smell your hair.  (Taste, touch, sight, sound and smell )  So it must be pleasing to him to smell your hair :)|`|unl2A4iqaa	he loves you.|`|lObEjUh1aa	he probably likes the way your hair smells.  maybe there's something that smells good in your shampoo or conditioner.|`|gGYLOK1vaa	he thinks you smell good..<br>  lol i read this at first thinking it was a random guy...i was then gonna say a creep..<br>  <br>  but it's your b/f so it's a different story lol|`|43v8jfQUaa	your hair smells good|`|bEHfhgvHaa	i think itmeans hes really into you

IXxSiXHtaa	In the UK it is illegal to tattoo someone who has been drinking or is drunk. Most tattooist will not tattoo someone, and risk their jobs. Anyone who will tattoo when you are pissed won't be very good, so stay away from them. <br>  <br>  |`|0UYJkSuZaa	Not many tattoo artists will tattoo you if you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Most will turn you down even if they think you may be under the influence. Also large amounts of alcohol thins your blood so you will be more likely to bleed while getting the tattoo and during the first few hours of the healing process. Tattoos don't really hurt that much. It's not as bad as people think it is going to be. If you are that worried and scared about the pain, then maybe you shouldn't be getting one.|`|PNIihEDXaa	ahh grow some balls! its like a right of passage for a tattoo to hurt otherwise it doesnt have a meaning to it anymore|`|6ByERt7faa	Ive gotten a tattoo sober, drunk, and stoned soooo I'll give you feedback.<br>  <br>  Sober (pelvic area) was fine except with it hit my bone.<br>  <br>  Drunk (they gave me a lollipop). It hurt a little bit (back piece).<br>  <br>  Stoned... prob hurt the worst lol. I couldn't imagine it ever ending... I think I bled a little more and I was really focused on everything. Hm never do that one again lol.<br>  <br>  Cheers to a tat though! Watch out they are addicting.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Bad idea - you might end up with something totally different to what you wanted sober - take a few panadols first if its allowed - alcohol is not a painkiller|`|b0B7yNZBaa	when youre drunk/high or have taken painkillers the tattoo artist won't do it because it thins your blood and you bleed like a biiiitch.|`|OhcsdKYLaa	just man up seriously. its not even that bad, plus you shouldnt get a tattoo while drunk. Alcohol thins your blood and you'll bleed more (not that you bleed much at all) <br>  it also does depend on your pain threshold and the place that you are getting tattooed but in general they really arent as bad as you think. I think that piercings hurt more.|`|pNDGcr5Iaa	Well, when you get a tattoo at my shop, you sign a contract that states that you are not intoxicated by either alcohol or drugs. And for good reason. Drunks unconsciously move around on you, bleed everywhere, cause alcohol thins the blood, want more stuff added to it, (after the price has been agreed on) and even yell at their kids or their wives on their cellphones... the list goes on. So, if you would, please don't get half in the bag to go get a tattoo. We really appreciate level headed people who just suck it up. Thanks for letting me rave on!|`|MfKWHH4Naa	You would bleed more since alcohol thins the blood. Also, most good shops won't tattoo you if you are drunk. But, I guess it would hurt less. Honestly, it's not that bad sober. People make a big deal out of it, but it's nothing really. I have 4 and I almost dosed off when I was getting one done.|`|XqfH76PMaa	It would depend on the person.  But, most tattooist will not tattoo you if you are drunk or they suspect that you have been drinking.  The reason for this is that you bleed worse when you have been drinking.  So, my advice would be to just suck it up and do it sober.  I did!|`|9an44M8naa	u shouldnt get a tat when ur drunk...it can cause a lot of bleeding and tht would mess it up also if u were drunk how are you gunna be sure that the equiptment is sterile..just wait till ur sober|`|QufZeqlVaa	dont recommend it. |`|MYtn10iRaa	well maybe it'll less hurt but more stupid for the person...<br>  Some artist even don't wanna tattoo a drunk person..
90080c775ecf140fc8842364c278fa93aa	I use scarzone. Its 10 bucks at walmart and It was so well for me. I see results after a week. <br>  <br>  I suggest talking to a dermatologist about them though.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	Talk to your dermatologist.  They have several things that could help.  I had an operation to remove scar tissue on my hand (bad scarring from an accident).  And that might be an answer as well.
XGeRMVdTaa	That doesn't sound true.<br>  Because everyone I know that has had it done says its extremely painful.<br>  <br>  I'd say not true.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	Been with two girls that had it done...one passed out...the other was in pain.   Neither had an orgasm.|`|ZqJJU8wAaa	Doubtful. Why would anyone want to do that????|`|tnUhxfjlaa	people don't clit pierced, they get they're clitoral hood pierced, your friends don't know what they're talking about|`|7kga2aRBaa	People actually DO THAT?!|`|uZP5SHd9aa	Not true. Trust me :)|`|tAJf2WC6aa	You definately don't orgasm when they pierce you, though it is possible to have orgasms when walking or moving, only if the jewellery is in the right place, where it actually rubs against the clitoris itself, resulting in pleasure.<br>  <br>  They are really fun tho, haha.|`|YLFgkVZUaa	doubt it.
jfVDkvvBaa	I'm catholic, with tattoos.  The answer is no, it's not a sin.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, people who argue that tattoos are a sin quote from Leviticus.  Well according to Leviticus (and other OT books), these people would also be sinning if they ate pork, touched a football (since it's made from pig), if they ever drank milk after eating meat, or wearing polyester.   The laws followed in Judaism were created to keep followers as pure as possible for Yahweh.  Christ delivers his followers from such stringent practices.<br>  <br>  You may encounter, but in the NT Jesus says our body is a temple to be a vessel of Christ.  I think also this is completely misleading.  If you are getting a tattoo to express yourself, this is not wrong.  When you start to get tattoos that are disrespectful, degrading, etc...then the argument would change. <br>  <br>  In the end...it does not change your relationship with God or your faith.  No it's not a sin.  If you're really THAT worried, go confess and get absolved.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your tatt|`|1SqP9KoCaa	u will definatley be looke at in a differen way|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	I would not think so.  Even in the bible there is a referance to Jesus having a sign of the alpha and the omega on him (possible tattoo).  However there are also referances to not mark your body as well.  Toughie.  Personally I have 5 and all are means of personal reflection of good times in my life and I don't think God would have a problem with that (he is a pretty forgiving being).<br>  <br>  As for the 7 deadly sins...I don't know how this even pertains.|`|6ZmdlLlqaa	It is a personal choice do not let someone else make this decision for you.  It is your body and you will have o see this tattoo for life.  Decide well.<br>  <br>  GL|`|biP0xgj7aa	Uh you want to get a tattoo of a cross but you don't even know what the seven deadly sins are? |`|H3PcFertaa	Only if YOU believe that it is.<br>  |`|Azz6U6Woaa	lol no but im atheist, so honestly it doesn't matter to me<br>  x|`|WWe3ArEtaa	Well according to the old testament it is, (“Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD” Leviticus 19:28),  but the new one does not say anything about it. On the other hand, by the word of God, if you have any doubt about an activity at hand, it is best not to engage in that activity, or ask God for his blessing.<br>  <br>  I guess it is up to you at the end of the day what you decide to do. I have one, and it can be seen as a sin that I can live with. I don't think you are supposed to do crosses (symbols) or dead people though. Those kinds of things are looked at as worshiping or something. <br>  <br>  Good luck in whatever you choose to do.|`|0CMGsVJJaa	Ok, I am Catholic and I have 2 tattoos. Actually both of them were given to me by an Ordained Minister... I was worried of the same thing because my Grandma is HUGE on religion. But Steve (my artist) told me that the whole defacing your body in the bible was referring to people in the old times that would cut off chunks of flesh and sometimes even limbs (extreme cases) in sacrifice to their god...<br>  <br>  So, a tattoo would not be considered defacing your body as long as it is nothing giving praise to another religious Deity. With a cross tattoo you should be set. (I have a Trinity on my left arm)<br>  <br>  Hope this was useful|`|qSSi2fcSaa	Dude, that is such a boring tattoo, everyone has that, even people that aren't even that religious. <br>  <br>  No it isn't a sin, you aren't Jewish. |`|xja7Ajt4aa	ok ima say this quick and easy my aunt is catholic and has alot of em im a christian i have tattoos it is nothing that is goin to make you go to hell specialy if it is a cross im getting the foot print poem tattooed on my arm so |`|UZldkMgRaa	depending on your faith and what you think is wrong.<br>  in the Jewish culture, you cant even be buried in a Jewish semmetary with a tatt,<br>  but i guess its all what you think.<br>  tattoos are beautiful, do what you want:)|`|OksQ2Rhgaa	A tattoo or body piercing is just as sinful as an ear piercing.|`|aMjNLzTPaa	Yes it is a big sin. Anything is a sin if God didnt create you with it. |`|ZifRB6Eqaa	no its just displaying your faith and how you think god is always there with you. there's nothing wrong with that. =]
mjQFg2icaa	You mean someone forced you to spend your money there?|`|mv7h2Wjbaa	yea i do i bought a hoodie online and it was 50 freaking dollars oh wells|`|O1b7das7aa	Their prices are expensive because (I believe) all their stores are located in large Malls.  Malls charge very high rents.  The merchandise is higher (you can buy the same t-shirts and shoes on line for much less) because they need to pay their high rents.|`|c773e75fa03db9335d6257f9c16e42acaa	Yeah, I definately agree with you; they are incredibly overpriced, and I found most of their stuff doesn't last a long time.|`|xIkHbC3Maa	yes, 50 4 that tshirt, you got ripped|`|bMeUnE4daa	Y wud yhu even waste yur money on a $50 dollar top!!! I wud shop online yhu save money and wait 4 stuff to go on sale. But they Are WAY expensive!!!|`|jaD10nZ0aa	You can get nearly all of the stuff from Hot Topic somewhere else and it's a lot cheaper. It's just cause Hot Topic is so well known that it's expensive. If you really wanna shop there, I suggest maybe just for accessories and band tees, cause they're the "originals" if you know what I mean, you may find it hard to come across the exact same band tee. But for jeans and stuff, you can get that anywhere.|`|1NDH1ncxaa	For sure, I used to work there, and prices for guys is cheaper then ladies stuff. I would never pay $50.00 for a top. What I usually do is buy the guys shirts (around back to school/holiday/sale Buy one rock-t, and get another half off) and stock up on at least 4 b/c then its like getting one for free, and alter them with scissors/ribbon/lace/bleach... just play. Then a shirt that was like $10-15$ looks like a higher priced ladies shirt, and no one else will have it, which is an issue when buying anything at Hot Topic. If prices are too high don't shop there. Yeah it may seem cool, but everybody else shops there too. Try sewing your own stuff. I'm sure you can do it! Thriftstores are your friend too! I promise :)|`|OEhsj6mTaa	hmmm... i don't know what hot topic your shopping at but you need to hold on to your money with a firmer fist. That's outrageous to pay money like that. over half the stuff at hot topic goes on clearance after a little while anyway and then they have half off sales on that. wait and hold out and you won't be spending tons of money and then wondering if a store is expensive or not.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I agree with you.  Their prices are way too high and a lot of things (tops in particular) are not of very good quality.  Plus, everything runs too small.  It's crazy!|`|DUa8B8mPaa	Hot Topic is for posers|`|VGVGcZwtaa	they are way overpriced but their website some some cool cheap clearance stuff!!
oVxr5B3Eaa	Every tattoo hurts. It's needles digging into your skin.<br>  You get over the pain though, and it's not a big deal. <br>  Don't let how much it hurts in different places determine where you get it. After you've had a few they really all feel the same. <br>  <br>  Oh, And Thomas A.... I have several tattoos and I make more than both my parents combined... And I'm only 19. Quite a bit more than minimum wage, dont ya think? <br>  The CEO of my company has VISIBLE tattoos and he makes a 6 figure salary. <br>  So SUCK ON THAT!<br>  What would it matter anyways? As long as they aren't on your face or hands, your employer would never know. What, does it go on your resume now? Do they do an underclothes tattoo check or something? News to me!|`|04e064b1e27b063681444d2c731a008daa	I just got one on my upper back last week. It hurt just a little, it really wasnt too bad. It iches like crazy right now. I think the iching is worse than the actual tattooing! <br>  <br>  I got a sacred heart with wings and a tiarra over the heart with my husband's name in the heart!|`|9LbTioS0aa	pain isnt UNBEARABLE but ya its gunna hurt|`|duXQDmTRaa	depends where on the back lol. i got mine done on my shoulder blades on my back..its not excruciating, but any tattoo hurts at least a tiny bit. you get used to it while its being done though. honestly tattoos dont hurt as much as everyone says they do. dont psych yourself out or else itll be worse than it actually is. its a tiny bit painful but nothing intolerable.|`|v1worPvIaa	If you get a tattoo period, it will hurt.<br>  Answer mine???<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081114214610AAKuA5X&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|YhbYPzoaaa	im sry but all tattoos hurt so the answer is yes|`|0cCHzcqsaa	Actually ones on the back are not that bad.It also depends on your pain tolerance and what you can handle.I have two on my back,one being semi-large and they were not too bad.I handled them well,but yesterday <br>  I got a chest piece above my boobs.That was almost unbearable for me and it is a larger piece.Depends on the person really.|`|XqfH76PMaa	The closer it is to the bone it is, the more it hurts.  What I mean is if it is on a more fleshy part of your body (your upper arm, your rump, your breast) is hurts less.  Of course, they all hurt a bit.  But, on places like your back, they do tend to hurt a bit more.  |`|bA8QhQLZaa	i got one on the top of my back between my shoulder blades.<br>  its not as bad as you think its going to be.<br>  go for it.<br>  you wont regret it.|`|GB5a86mgaa	Hell it would hurt.
