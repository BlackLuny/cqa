20090128124819AAWgcMn	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A poem on Change?...?	in it's most obvious sense. CR.      (“But what is happiness, except the simple harmony between a man and the live he leads?”   Albert Camus)            The seasons will always pass.   Whatever happens, they are there,   Gradual background changes    Acting as a canvas for our daily lives;   The powerful set behind our mundane urban dramas.      Anger, jealousy, petty squabbles   A human life is so small.   We are like ants, so tough and tiny,   poking about at the surface of the Earth   Seldom thinking to look around us and see.       “This bloody cold!”    “Where is the Spring?”    “Ice-rain-sleet-snow”“Drive carefully”   “Severe weather warning today”    “Rain again.  Awful weather we’ve been having”      Stark winter: sharp brightness   Uncompromising, yet beautiful.   Strangers’ breath clouds mingle in the Underground.   Carefully skirting the road’s ice-patches,   Intricate frost flakes cling to spiderwebs.  Crystal fragility.      Winter softens to spring: time of paradox.   Shifting sensation, tangible, urgent in the air –    Just look at birds nesting; the treetops are never so close.   Slick of greasy rain on the pavements, yet there’s   Green shoots amongst the grey.  There is change. Hope.         I just wrote this very quickly so I'd appreciate any critique. Thanks!

Isn't my hate and disgust for the world, god, and myself as glorious and transcendent as my love? If I must accept and love the world's / god's beauty, must I not also reject and hate it for the suffering, and with as much righteousness? Love and hate are two things, or one? Is, or is not, my hate and suffering just as exalted and powerful as my love and joy? Is or is not my love just as debased and awful as my hate? Since when should love get all the love? Do you recognize that love is a judgment?

I actually have 3 idea today guys. if you've seen my other posts, i write weird stories. heres my 3 ideas      Idea#1: 30 years into the future, global warming has melted the artic ice. Oil companies go there to find oil to fuel the short oil supply. This idea was just thought up. let me know what should be in the ice or what i should reveal. include your first name as i will mention you as a chrecter in the book or i will put you on the Thanks page.      Idea#2:  In a militaristic america, it could take place anywhere, but in a civilized country. anyway, there is a competition each year in which the goverment picks out 300 kids at random. these kids must go to a faraway building which has thousands of rooms. now heres where i dont know which way to go... should the kids be able to hide and then military comes in and shoots down anyone they see and then the last person wins or should i have the kids have to fight each other and the last one left wins.      Idea#3: In the future the earth gets pushed off course from the sun and in 2years is blocked from the suns rays by a disccovered black planet yet to be named. this planet throws the earth in complete darkness. it also gives the earth extreme weather conditions. let me know how you think this should be played out         just let me know what you guys think. your compliments help me alot and any advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks

20090128135506AAUSQMU	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Sticky keys or broken keys...?	So, yesterday my band director asked me to play for his band - Wind Ensemble (the best band in the school). But, only if I switch to bass clarinet (I'd played the normal Bb clarinet five years already) and I of course said yes [I'm a band nerd :D]. Anyway, when I took it home that night to practice, I noticed that I could not play the middle/high B or C. The keys were already covering the holes and there is no way to get them to come off in order to get the note to come out. But, as far as I know, that's wrong, but I don't know everything about the bass clarinet - example A. So this morning, I took it school and asked my band director about it. However, he knows nothing about it either (his forte is brass) and said I was to ask the other bass clarinetist. And I planned to do so, though she was not there for rehearsal, so I was not able to ask my question. SOOOO, I came to Yahoo to ask all you Yahooers about it. Let me know as soon as possible! I have NO time to waste. I have to practice for orchestra AND wind ensemble, so no stupid answers either.   Very much appreciated! :]

20090225125555AAwdXyx	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	If you've been in a tough place, I wanna know about it?!?	I'm a massive fan of poetry and write my own. I want some 'inspiration' emotion material to motivate me to write something completely brilliant!   I want some real deep stuff, profoundly moving subject matters. However, I'm wanting to write a combination of all bad feelings.       Here's your oppurtunity to rant to your hearts content. Anything you like. Just get it off your chest...      Please can you anyone who opens this question leave a comment, and then that way we'll end up with such a vast amount of perceptives. Even if you think what you has to say is irrelevant or trivial I would love to hear from every single individual out there. Everybodys experienced something life changingly rubbish.      Death of a loved one   Suicide   Depression   Mental Illness   Divorce   Departure   Drugs   Alcoholism   Any form of abuse   Bullying (victim or bully)   Experienciences in jail   Eating disorders   Self harm   Guilt   Terminal Illness   Self doubt   Worthlessness   Hopelessness!      Trust me, everything you have to say is crucial to me.   Here's your oppurtunity to anoumonsly share all that rubbish you've experienced without being condemned.      The reason I ask is because at 15 years old I can't even begin to comprehend what feeling some of these awful things must feel like, so how am I going to express them in my own words?! I know many of you won't respond to this because you feel "you have to go through it to really appreciate the weight of the world on your shoulders". I know. I appreciate that. But please do try.      I'll post the poem on here when it's perfected.      All my deepest sympathies,   Rachel x

Please tell me more about it, like if she is angry, or her moods throughout... and any other information would be great! THANK YOU!      HELENA    How happy some o'er other some can be!   Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.   But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;   He will not know what all but he do know:   And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,   So I, admiring of his qualities:   Things base and vile, folding no quantity,   Love can transpose to form and dignity:   Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;   And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:   Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;   Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:   And therefore is Love said to be a child,   Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.   As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,   So the boy Love is perjured every where:   For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,   He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;   And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,   So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.   I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:   Then to the wood will he to-morrow night   Pursue her; and for this intelligence   If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:   But herein mean I to enrich my pain,   To have his sight thither and back again.

All I remember is that they were about a girl who was a mermaid (kind of). She left to do something (I don't remember what). She meets a boy about her age (who turns out to be Merlin). They go on a quest to find Excalibur and in the end she half-dies and becomes the Lady of the Lake. The last chapter or so is the older Merlin bringing Arthur to the lake to get Excalibur which the Lady of the Lake has kept safe.       That's pretty much all I remember... The books weren't called the Lady of the Lake or anything like that. (Maybe the last one was...) This is seriously going to drive me crazy. Help please!

Sometimes I feel tired, like no matter what happens to me or what I have, my mind just keeps turning and chewing things over, things which dont even matter. Happiness and sadness are just opposite sides of the same coin, and theres nothing great or truly beautiful in either. Maybe Im longing for the transcendent, the brief glimpses of that sublime feeling when I look up at the stars or experience nature. I just feel like there has to be something more than the petty issues In my life that I cant help thinking about.

20090128124121AAfcgS6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	It's a small portion of my story, which is about a 17-year old girl who is held captive by a 22-year old man and, as irrational as it may seem, falls in love with him. It's called "Stockholm Syndrome: story of a victimized girl"...      Criticisms are encouraged! Try to be as critical as you can, and suggestions will be nice. Tell me what you think of the overall story so far.. :) Also, do you think it's worthy enough to continue it?   Chapter 5:   The chain was fairly long and seemed to be very heavy. One end of the chain was attached to the wall, and the other side was joined to a chain-like cuff. Eric, picking me up with one arm, threw me against the wall indifferently. My back hit the rough wall hard, and it began to ache. My head hit the rocky surface of the floor, throbbing. Eric kicked me in the gut, causing the pain to worsen. The pain then became unbearable, and I closed my eyes to try and detach myself from my body.       Pain is just an illusion. Pain is just an illusion.       I repeated this in my head several times, but it wasn’t as effective as I’d hoped. I couldn’t isolate myself from my body; I was part of my body. I couldn’t ignore the inevitable soreness it was feeling. I held my knees with both of my arms and shut my eyes tight, enduring the pain. I felt Eric’s body close to mine.       I knew exactly what he was up to.      I opened my eyes and saw him staring back at me with his fierce, green eyes. Brutally taking my legs into his grasp, he opened the cuff of the chain. He placed it just above my left foot and securely fastened it with a key. I looked as he tossed the key into the corner of the room, far out of my reach. There was no way out of this place. I looked around, making an attempt to figure out where I was. The place was dim, but bright enough to notice that it was an attic. The wooden roof was arched, and the room was essentially empty, but an ancient piano was placed at the corner of the attic. It looked like it hadn’t been touched in years. Just like everywhere else in the attic, it was dusty and dirty.      I glared up at Eric, who was towering over me. He looked down at me intently with his fierce, intimidating eyes. I wondered why he would ever want to do such a thing to someone he’d just met, but came up with no conclusions. I assumed that there really was no reason – that he was just an insane psychopath who had sadistic cravings.      I couldn’t stay in this attic all day though. I had needs to take care of. Bathroom needs. If he intended on keeping me alive, I needed to fulfill these necessities.      “Are you g-going to k-k-kill me?” I managed to stutter out.      He kneeled down, face-to-face with me. I could see his face clearly now – it was perfectly structured – his eyes, nose, lips. No one would expect him to be homicidal.      “No,” he simply replied. “Unless you give me a reason to.”      “If you really mean that…well, er…” I managed to say. I didn’t know how I would finish the statement. I was scared he’d laugh at me, or even hit me for it. I didn’t know what to expect.      “Get on with it.”      “Well…I need to take care of some…necessities.”      He chuckled, and gestured toward a door near me. It was close – close enough that I didn’t need to take off the chain.       “Now be a good girl and shut the hell up.”   ***   Chapter 6:   I was tired. I was thirsty. And I needed to use a bathroom…   Both my head and stomach were aching terribly, and I began to feel the hot dog I had eaten on my last day of contentment make its way back up my throat. Immediately, I ran into the bathroom and puked into the sink. My throat felt sore, so I turned on the faucet and began rinsing my mouth before finally using the toilet.      The bathroom was dirty, but I wasn’t surprised to see it in such a filthy condition. Like the attic, it was dusty and looked ancient – it was plain to see that nobody actually used it. There was a small, dirty mirror placed on top of the sink. Using my incredibly filthy sweater, I rubbed the dust off of the mirror and, indifferently, took a look at my reflection. I wasn’t shocked to see myself in such a horrid state – my dark auburn hair, which was seemingly wet with grease, hung down over chest. My naturally ivory-rose complexion appeared unusually pale and dark rings emerged around my hazel eyes.      I desperately needed to wash my grease-enveloped face, so, once again, I turned on the faucet and waited for the warm water to arrive; but it never came. I decided to work with what I had and splashed the ice-cold water on my face, then my hair. And, while I was at it, I took a big gulp of water from the faucet, and then another.      By the time I was done, my whole head was soaking wet. I made my way back to the original spot I was and, while freezing my soaking head off, waited. Waited for abuse. Waited for potential death. I didn’t know what to expect – just that I wouldn’t be alone for too long. It irritated the hell out of me to remain unaware of what my fate would be in this place

20090128114901AAFsWxi	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Valentine's Day Performance?	Since I want to be a dance instructor when I grow up, I began teaching my little cousins (8,7, and 5) and they all say I'm the best teacher in the world and can't wait for our afternoon dance lessons. Well, we had to stop dance lessons when we moved out of their house into our own, but I know we'll be together on Valentine's Day. I thought it would be really cute to put on a little performance, but I don't know what to make them do. I mainly just taught them how to look good dancing, how find their strengths and weaknesses and use them,and how to make a mistake look like they did it on purpose. For warm-ups I showed them a few belly dancing and hip hop dance videos, but I never officially taught them to dance this way. What style of dance or dance routine do you think they should do?

I got smacked by this girl, and she got me good only because she confused me so i couldn't block away her hand. She had her hip kind of out a little bit when she was staring at me, and then put her left hand on it, so i was watching her left hand when she did that. But then, her right hand flew out and slapped my face. I was stuck, i had like, no way to block that!! She had this look on her face like she was pretty satisfied too. That move she used on me ONLY worked because she confused me with it!!!! It was like i couldn't move, there wasn't any way to block her hand. Or is there? Tell me if there is, cuz i don't know. Have you ever had to use this on a guy before? I didn't think anything like that would work, but, it does.

20090128134200AAi8WjP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this story O.K? (Its written by me, and im only 13)?	Well, Im not using my age as an excuse or anything.   And i would like constructive criticism but dont be TOO rude. Of course, you can tell me what you didnt like about it but just dont be REALLY mean. this is my first shot at writing so its probably not that great.   There will be a plot. This is just the beggining of the story. I am also aware that the chapters are too short. But its not going to be a chapter book or anything (And its never going to be published anyways)       Chapter One               It was a cold day in Saginaw. The crispy brown and yellow leaves were falling at an alarming rate and the wind was howling with excitement.            “Erica!” Mrs. Smith shouted .   I could almost feel her anger radiate off her skin.    “This is the second time you’ve been staring out the window today! Make it a third and you’ll receive a call home” she said with a scowl.    I heard a snicker and turned around. Of course, there was my brother who sat directly behind me laughing at how dazed I was. Even though Ethan is my brother, we are very close friends.    I gave my brother a sour look  and swiftly turned around with my brown hair facing my brother before Mrs. Smith had another reason to give me a lecture.            We continued working on math until we heard a knock at the door and Mrs. Smith stood up from her desk promptly and opened it. Whoever was at the door appeared to be my age. She had blue eyes and curly dark brown hair. She looked as though she just walked off of a runway. “Is this the grade 7 Math Class?” I heard her ask in a hushed tone.” Of  course! Come on in dear.”      She walked elegantly across the room and took her seat next to me. It was almost too elegant, considering she was wearing high heels. I was quite surprised she didn’t fall flat on her face.                   Chapter Two         My house was the smallest on the block, but I felt quite happy where I live.It was easy to pick apart from all the other houses on my street, and was like finding a dandelion within a dozen of roses.      I walked into my house and slammed the door to let my parents know I was home. After I crossed the hallway to enter the kitchen, I sat on a stool and leaned my elbows against the hard marble kitchen counter. We recently painted the kitchen a pale blue because mom claimed that the musty yellow color was bad for our health. I remember painting this kitchen. We couldn’t afford a painter to come in, so my brother and I bravely volunteered to paint it. My brother and I mostly flung paint at each other, but we still got the job done.               My thoughts were quickly interrupted when I felt something crawling up my shoulder. “Ahh!” I shrieked. What the hell is on my back? I quickly spun around and noticed it was just my brother. “The next time you do that the kitchen won’t be the only thing that’s blue!” I told him. “Oh I’m so scared!” he replied tauntingly while rolling his eyes.   “Oh you better be” I muttered before running off to my room.            Chapter 3            The next day at school, the “new” girl was sitting next to me. This would be a good chance to ask her name I thought, although she looked quite intimidating with her perfect face, brown eyes and curly hair. Are those real diamonds in her ears? I thought to myself.            Like mom always told me,”Don’t Judge a book by its Cover.” So I  looked in her direction and whispered quietly enough for her to hear. “Whats your name?” “Uhmm..Candice” she muttered back Her voice sounded softer than honey.. She didn’t seem willing to tell me more about herself, so I let the conversation drop. She seemed like she was hiding an important  secret.   Even in gym later that day she passed the volleyball so gracefully that the ball appeared to be just slipping off of her fingers. Our gym teacher was so impressed that they offered her to be on the volleyball team.
20090128134147AAmfQMW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Are there any good books that detail the history of slang for writing research?	Specifically, I'm setting a story at the turn of the last century, say 1900 to 1910ish, and I wanted to find a book that had slang terms listed by the year or decade in which they were used/most popular.      I've found some sites online, but they either group too many years together (like 1900-1930), start too late (not until 1930), or they make no distinction as to when the term originated or was used.       Does anyone know of any good books that list out slang by the timeliness of its use?       This is for pure writing research and I'm sure it would be handy to a number of us on this site if we found such a book no matter when our stories were set.      Thanks in advance.

20090128133445AA1DhNH	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	I just read about Pessimistic Induction being used against Scientific Realism? Why are some against it?	The last couple of days I was starting to read about Scientific Realism and the arguments for and against.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_...  One argument against scientists being able to say that our scientific theories, laws, etc, being approximately true is Pessimistic Induction.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimistic...  It says that the History of Science is a graveyard of scientific theories which used to be successful, but are now abandoned.  I did a Google search on it, and apparently a lot of people don't think Pessimistic Induction is a good argument against scientists coming to approximate truth.  That just doesn't make sense?  Why wouldn't someone think that?      The Scientific Method is observing, coming up with ideas, and then testing them.  Ever since 1687, Science picked up the idea of "testing" your ideas from Isaac Newton.  Ever since then, it's been a graveyard of scientific ideas.  You can even look at the timeline of the Scientific Method, and just think how much Science says they have it right.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of...  Just like many keep on saying it'll be the end of the world and are always wrong, scientists keep on thinking Science has it right.  Just like we now use scientific principles in technology today, such as cell phones, scientific principles were also successful back then, and are now abandoned.  Just because it works in technology, doesn't mean it's even probably true.      Using Inference to the Best Explanation, it would all make more sense if we never even get close to being approximately true, even if we do move closer.  It used to be that people believed Gravity and Gravitation were actually a "force".  Then Einstein came along saying it's not a force, but rather curvatures in spacetime.  Since then, experiments always show that it's curvatures in spacetime rather than an actual force.  The only reason they still teach gravity/gravitation as a force in school is because it's less complicated, and the implications of the theory work in most situations, but that doesn't mean it's probably true (in fact, it doesn't work in many situations where General Relativity does).      If A then B, that doesn't mean If B then A; because there could also be "If C then B" and "If D then B".  In Science, you say, "If this theory is true, we'd expect this to happen. We see our outcome happened."  Just because it happened, doesn't prove the other way around, our scientific theory, because another theory could explain what happened, that we may not be aware of.  You're only failing to disprove, or committing the informal logical fallacy of affirming the consequent. Although proving is not logical, disproof is logical, because it's modus tollens.  However, disproof is not practical.  Deductive logic is only as good as your starting assumptions, and somewhere down the line started with induction.  Many popular scientific theories had many failed experiments when they first came out, but then came out to shine.  It's almost like we need to "take time to realize" that our Modern Science will eventually pass us by.      So why are people against Pessimistic Induction?  Scientific Realism doesn't make any sense on the inductive "Inference to the Best Explanation" level, nor the Deductive Logic level.

20070126161300AASv2D2	Arts & Humanities;History	A-t-ton perdu la guerre de 40 à cause du front populaire ?	C'est un argument beaucoup employé par la droite de l'époque (je pense à des textes de l'Action fran?aise) : le FP, en voulant la paix sans préparer la guerre (budget militaire en baisse) a désarmé la France et fait que nous avons perdu la guerre en quelques jours.

20070313090646AAg2A5f	Arts & Humanities;History	La France avait-elle une chance contre l'Allemagne en 1940 ?	On a dit tout et n'importe quoi à ce sujet. A ma connaissance, la France avait des chars nombreux et souvent plus puissants que les Allemands (les B1 bis, par exemple). Par contre, leur doctrine d'emploi en petit paquets et leur faible autonomie était un handicap.    La France manquait par contre d'avions modernes, surtout pour l'attaque au sol et était engluée dans sa stratégie défensive (la ligne Maginot, à l'origine, devait arrêter une attaque brutale, le temps que le pays mobilise, et non être con?ue comme une barrière infranchissable).    Le commandement s'est montré souvent nul. Gamelin, réputé cultivé, qui s'était montré capable en 14-18, a été en dessous de tout. Quand au passage par les Ardennes, il était possible de le prévenir en piégeant cet endroit, ou tout du moins était il possible de le surveiller. Cela aurait au moins permis à des renforts d'avoir le temps de se redéployer, au lieu d'être soumis à une surprise stratégique.       Quel est votre avis sur cette question ?

Here's the question:   Consider the potential for improved national unity at the turn of the century as well as the potential for increased regional tension. How were these regions interconnected and how did they depend on each other. Be sure to look at African American migration, urbanization, foreign immigration, and corporate development.

O sea, tanto el excesvo amor, como el excesivo desamor, son la negación de la tolerancia y la buena voluntad.Todos los excesos, aún el exceso del bien, desequilibran la balanza, por eso pues, es mejor estar y buscar el centro.

Vaca la copa cada noche , para que Dios te la llene de agua nueva en el nuevo da.Vive de instante en instante por que esa es la vida. Se gana y se pierde,se sube y se baja, se nace y se muere, y la historia es tan simple, ?Porqu te preocupas tanto?, No te sientas triste y olvidado todos somos LA SAL DE LA TIERRA. En la tranquilidad hay salud, como plenitud dentro de uno. Prdonate, acptate, recnocete y mate, recuerda q tienes que vivir contigo mismo por la eternidad, borra el pasad para no repetirlo. Si ests atento al presente, el pasado no te distraera, entonces sers siempre nuevo. S quieres recuperar la salud, abandona la critca, el resentimiento, la culpa y el miedo, responsable de todas nuestras enfermedades. No te quejes recuerda que naciste desnudo, entonces, ese pantaln y esa camisa que llevas son ganancias. Liberate de la ansiedad, piensa que lo que debe ser ser, y suceder naturalmente..

Los romanos, representaban al dios Eros griego, como un angel/demonio,cupído,que gustaba flechar incautos para hacerlos padecer el amor. Toda una definición, de la idéa que ellos tenían de lo que que es al amor.Cierto que más pragmáticos y pedestres que lo griegos, han sido una raza guerrera por lo tanto para ellos de heridas, también el amor era ocasión.      He aforizado una frase de mi ocurrencia y tras el breve proemio histórico/mítico, les pregunto que opinan de este decir,,,      ?Es caprichoso el amor,,,?   ?Tal como cupído lo representa, es una apuesta de azar que en las flechas del angél, liga personas que luego tendrán que "batallar", para no quedar encerrados en una burla del destino,,?   ?Como lo piensan,,,?      No tomo partido por ninguna cuestión en especial, tan sólo espero por aquello que se les ocurra y quieran comentarmelo,,,   Gracias,,Orlando,,,

Acepta la dificultad de edificarte a ti mismo y el valor de empezar    corrigiéndote.    El triunfo del verdadero hombre surge de las cenizas de su error.    Nunca te quejes de Tu soledad o de Tu suerte, enfréntala con valor y    acéptala.      De una manera u otra es el resultado de tus actos y prueba que Tu siempre    has de ganar.    No te amargues de Tu propio fracaso ni se lo cargues a otro, acéptate ahora    o seguirás justificándote como un ni?o.    Recuerda que cualquier momento es bueno para comenzar y que ninguno es tan    terrible para claudicar.      No olvides que la causa de Tu presente es Tu pasado así como la causa de Tu    futuro será Tu presente.    Aprende de los audaces, de los fuertes, de quien no acepta situaciones, de    quien vivirá a pesar de todo, piensa menos en tus problemas y más en Tu    trabajo y tus problemas sin alimentarlos morirán.    Aprende a nacer desde el dolor y a ser más grande que el más grande de los    obstáculos,      Mírate en el espejo de ti mismo y serás libre y fuerte y dejarás de ser un    títere de las circunstancias porque Tu mismo eres Tu destino.    Levántate y mira el sol por las ma?anas y respira la luz del amanecer.    Tú eres parte de la fuerza de Tu vida, ahora despiértate, lucha, camina.      Decídete y triunfarás en la vida; nunca pienses en la suerte, porque la    suerte es:    el pretexto de los fracasados.      P. Neruda          Un abrazo de os@   Noemi

20090225074600AAZlQ8p	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	What is a good logo to replace this old one?	My old logo said "Learn for Life"  However we did a copyright search and it came up as already been taken. I need something that small to replace it.  My mind is only coming up with longer wording.  It has to be at least 3 words long that are meaningful and stand out.  The idea is for a low profile medical school.   Thanks for your ideas!

20090225075411AA7qUFw	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can anyone explain these two poems by A.A. Milne?	Hello there... can you make sense of these two poems by A.A. Milne: "Jonathan Jo" and "Politeness"? They look like nursery rhymes, but I'm sure there's a lot more to them.   Thanks!   ................................   Jonathan Jo      Jonathan Jo   Has a mouth like an "O"   And a wheelbarrow full of surprises;   If you ask for a bat,   Or for something like that,   He has got it, whatever the size is.      If you're wanting a ball,   It's no trouble at all;   Why, the more that you ask for, the merrier -   Like a hoop and a top,   And a watch that won't stop,   And some sweets, and an Aberdeen terrier.      Jonathan Jo   Has a mouth like an "O,"   But this is what makes him so funny:   If you give him a smile,   Only once in a while,   Then he never expects any money!   .........................................   Politeness      If people ask me,   I always tell them:   "Quite well, thank you, I'm very glad to say."   If people ask me,   I always answer,   "Quite well, thank you, how are you to-day?"   I always answer,   I always tell them,   If they ask me   Politely.....   BUT SOMETIMES      I wish      That they wouldn't.

20090225080049AAALMkD	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Other - Visual Arts	What should I choose as my starting point for my Art GCSE?	I have narrowed my choices down to two possible starting points. 'Cakes, desserts and puddings' or 'Reversal'.      For 'Cakes, desserts and puddings' for my final exam I was thinking that I could make an old fashioned cake shop out of clay or maybe a gingerbread house.      For reversal I could do colour reversal or stuff backwards. Reversal is a broader topic which I would love to do but I don't have any ideas for coursework or my final exam.      I can either produce fine art or 3 dimensional (clay).      Which starting point should I choose and what could I produce for coursework and my final exam?      All ideas appreciated!      xox
