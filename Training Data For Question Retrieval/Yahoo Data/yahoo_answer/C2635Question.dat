We took it to the Nissan place to get it fixed, but they didn't do anything but clean some sensors and fix a wire. So here's the deal. It is bucking like crazy after it warms up. We already replaced the distributor and cam sensor. Not always at the same time, but codes 0110, 0340 and GM code 1336 have been spitting out. After a while, it just gives up and has no spark until it cools down. What's the relationship between the cam sensor and the computer as well as the relationship between the mass airflow sensor and cam sensor? If anyone knows what's going on, please help me.

20090131111159AAGBcN0	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Whining noise and flickering battery light on 2003 BMW 325 Sport - what's wrong?	My car has recently started making a constant whining noise which can be heard at all revs, especially at low revs. It basically sounds like the engine is more high-pitched than usual. I have also noticed out of the corner of my eye whilst driving that occasionally the battery light flickers on for a fraction of a second and then goes off again. I've checked the oil, and have recently replaced the battery, so they aren't a problem.    I don't know much about cars, but does this sound like an alternator problem? That would make sense to me as the pitch of the whining noise increases with the revs in the engine, so it must be something that's being turned by the engine.     If so, any idea how much it costs to get an alternator replaced?    Any help would be much appreciated!

20090131115509AAdI0N6	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1990 honda crx problem help.?	Ok so my crx (1990 honda crx) was throwing a code 16 and wont start.  Here is what I have done so far.  1. Replaced spark plugs, wires, distributor rotors, and cap.  2. Replaced Battery.  3.  Replaced fuel filter.  4.  Replaced fuel pump.    How problem started.  Problem started about 4 months ago. The car would run find while driving but once I turn the car off, it would not start.  I would try a few times and then battery would die, and I would have to jump start the car.  Every time I jumped it, it would start right up.  It got to the point where the car would start, and I would drive it, and when I turned it off, it wouldnt start for a few days.  After about a day or 2, it would start right up again and repeat same process over and over.   Fixing process.  I finally decided to tune it up a bit. I did a full oil change, replaced the spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, rotors, and fuel filter. After that, it started right up again and ran find for about a day. On the second day, the problem came back again. I noticed that when starting the car, the check engine light would come on. Now when you first turn the key to the on position, the check engine light and all the other lights come on, I know this. But it goes off.  What I am saying is during the starting process the check engine light comes on again.  So I looked at the ecu and it was throwing code 16, which has to do with the fuel injectors.  I was told to test the injectors resistance with an ohm meter. The primary injector should be showing between 0.6 and 1.6 ohms, and the auxiliary should be showing between 0.6 and 10 ohms. I tested them, and both seem to be good.  I finally decided to get a fuel system cleaner.  I put cleaner in and got the car to start.  I ran the car all day without turning it off just in case. I even took it on the free way and ran it at high speed.  After that, I turned the car off, and let it sit for about 18 hours. It was about 9pm at night and it was cold so I decided it was a good time to test the car.  I tried to start it and it started right up with no hesitation. I then turned it off and tried it again just to make sure, and it started right up.  So I drove it for about 5 minutes and then parked it again and turned it off and tried to start it again and it started right up again with no problem.   So I figured the problem was fixed.  The next morning, I went to do one last test. I tried to start it and it started find again, so I took it for another drive.  While I was driving the car sounded like it ran out of gas and just died.  I tried over and over to start it but best I could get it to do is start and then die 2 seconds later.  I towed it home and tried to diagnose the problem again.  First I checked the fuel filter and it had some dirt in it so I washed it out with gas.  I put it back on and tried to start the car and still no luck.  I took it off again and noticed there was no fuel going to the car anymore.  I noticed I couldnt hear the fuel pump either so I replaced the fuel pump.  I turned the keys to the on position and waited a few minutes then checked the fuel line again to see if it had fuel in it and it had plenty lol. But I still cant get car to start.  So now I am back here again looking for help to see what could be the problem.  I am still getting code 16 on my euc. What i was thinking is to replace the injectors one at a time to see which one was causing the problem.  If anyone has any other ideas, Please let me know i am stuck lol.

While replacing my rotors and pads on my Explorer, the right front caliper pushed one of it's pistons out and green fluid gushed out. What was that fluid? (i assume it was HSMO brake fluid) I properly installed everything and appear to have no leaks. Unknowingly at the time, I replaced some of the fluid with DOT 3 fluid. I was told your not supposed to mix the two.      I bled the brakes to get the last air out of them and dark fluid came out, which I assume is heavily moisterized brake fluid. But I don't know how it changed color from green to dark brown that fast?       The fluid that came out of the brake caliper, was that brake fluid? if not what was it and how do I replace it? The brakes are currently still a little too squishy, should I just flush the system and try with new brake fluid? or have a caused another problem on accident. I'm pretty hand with making vehicles go fast but apparently not with stopping them. :P

20090131120312AAg34lS	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1990 Mazda RX7 hard start after warming up?	I want to buy this 1990 RX7, but the owner says it has a hard time starting up after it gets warmed up.  He says that when the engine is cold, and he turns it on, it warms right up.  However, after driving it around, and then parking somewhere, it sounds like its flooding or something when he goes to start it up again.  Does anybody know what the problem is, how it can be fixed, and how much it would cost to fix?  My dad has been an equipment mechanic for 20 years, so he knows his fair share about engines (even full engine rebuilds and stuff), and he can usually diagnose problems with an engine, but he's uneasy about working on a rotory engine cause hes never seen or worked on one before.  The guy says that he thinks it is  problem with the ECU or fuel pump.  If it is the ECU, where can I get a replacement one, and how much would it cost.

I don't want to go all 'Wild Hogs' and buy a bunch of stuff I won't really need but I don't want to get too cheap and not get something that would help with safety or make riding more enjoyable.       Everyone agrees you need a good helmet, gloves, boots and jacket. Is there anything else I should be looking for. Also should I worry about getting an armored jacket in case of an accident? With prescription glasses would a 3/4 helmet be better then a full helmet? If I ride to work in dress pants would I need to wear chaps or would it be fine w/o them for the short commute?

20090131134818AAr7GiB	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	What's wrong with my car? ?	I have an 05 chevy impala and it's been acting up a bit. Every few months it goes through a spurt when it's a little jerky when it shifts. It bumps when it shifts into each gear. No noise, and it's not all the time. I know it's probably something with the transmission, just hoping it's not 2,400 bucks. Thanks.. btw it's an automatic.

20090225093114AAhA65G	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Cost to replace ignition switch?	I need the ignition switch replaced on my car, and I'm definitely not mechanically inclined to do it myself.      My mechanic came back with an estimates for parts and labor, and it just seem so high for such a basic part that he already has in stock.  Lately I feel like my mechanic is taking me for a ride since I don't know enough about cars to argue.  Without revealing what the estimate was, I'm curious to know what other professionals would charge/expect to pay?  Car is a '98 Toyota Avalon. (Estimate did not include the extra charge to replace the microchip key.  Instead I will have two separate keys, one for my door and one for my ignition.)  Thanks.
