20090303103954AAtJ5Dx	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Do you think I ate well today?	Breakfast: 1 slice of seeded brown toast topped with mashed banana      Snack: A sandwich, same bread, with plain hummus, cherry tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber and Quorn (basically fake meat, and lower fat)      Lunch: Handful of strawberries, a banana, an apple, two clementine oranges and a bottle of pure orange juice.      Snack 2: Handful of cashew nuts and 2 wholegrain crackers topped with hummus.      I haven't eaten dinner yet, but it will be a plate of broccoli, sweetcorn and carrots with some orange juice to increase iron absorption.       I have drunk 4 cups of green tea today, and about a litre of water. I will continue to drink water and will have 1 more cup of green tea before bed. I got adequate exercise, since my school is on a hill and involves a lot of walking to and from classes.       I'm 14, almost 5'4 and 8 stone 4 lbs. I think that's like 114-115 lbs to those who aren't in the UK.       Will I lose weight if I continue like this? How long will it take?      Thanks a bunch. (:

Nothing fried, something grilled? I'm not sure, let me know! And is there a certain effect that I might feel after I eat meat the first time in 7 years?

20090304114547AAfMIkN	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Is an apple worth a thousand apples?	… so… in response to one of my previous questions, one respondent posts this:      “nothing has intrinsic value, everything only has the value we imbue it. we are all islands surrounded by ocean”      (I’m pretty sure if I go to ‘Wikipedia Ayn Rand’, I can find that direct quote.)      This is the way my confused thought process goes on this scenario:      If the apple is intrinsically worthless then the only ‘value’ of the apple is established by my subjective interpretation of the apple and if my subjective interpretation is hypothetically unlimited then the apple possesses potentially unlimited subjective value and that means the apple always potentially possesses the value of a thousand apples.      Now, that sounds pretty stupid to me, and the Ayn Rand disciple will immediately counter, “that doesn’t mean anybody else will ever actually recognize that value” (which sounds like recognition of objective reality to me, but let’s indulge the subjective theorist and pretend we didn’t notice that) but ultimately, this kind of thinking is precisely what we do when we ‘invest’ in a ‘market’, and the potential consequences of this kind of ideology ought to be abundantly obvious to most of us… right… about… NOW…      As the value of our investments plummets, we suddenly realize the apple we contributed five years ago is today… AN APPLE… as opposed to the thousand apples we were so sure would miraculously appear based on the single criterion of our grandiose expectations.      I contend an apple is an apple as opposed to a thousand apples, and any contrary subjective interpretation is the product of profound mental deficiency without basis in material reality. In addition, I contend these are not ‘opinions’, each equally valid with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, but that reality is DEMONSTRABLY OBJECTIVE, and belief that reality is subjective is simply DEMONSTRABLY WRONG.  (I’ve got more if you don’t appreciate this one. I’m starting with the simplest, clearest version.)      … so the question is…      Is reality objective (that means you observe, measure, experience and discover reality, such as GRAVITY for example) or is reality subjective (that means you float on a flying carpet in a magical faerie dream realm where marshmallow clouds rain down chocolate gum drops whenever you are hungry, if that’s not enough, you can always wiggle your nose at an apple and turn it into a thousand apples)?
