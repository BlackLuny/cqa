AA11215068	The "firewall" isn't for you stove. It is the wall that separates your condo form you neighbors and has a one or two hour rating depending on how old the building is. That's in case a fire breaks out on one side or the other and the wall should contain the fire for at least the term of the rating.    You can move your stove but you will have to have a 220v outlet at the new location. You can (make sure the breaker is off) take the current 220v receptacle off and run the wire into a junction box, then run a new wire from there to the new location and install the old receptacle. I wouldn't be concerned about the wet wall since the receptacle is going to be on the outside of the wall and not inside with the electrical wiring. I'm sure an inspector would disagree but I live in the real world and not in National Code Book for electrical sources.    Just a note about "fire" rated drywall. There is nothing special about it. There are no additives in the gypsum that retard fire. The only difference between fire rated drywall and regular drywall is that the former has more paper on the back. Look at is this way. Light a piece of paper on fire using a match. It catches on fire and flairs up rather quickly. Now take a "closed" phone book and try to light is on fire with a match. You won't have much success. The phone book is too dense and will take more than the flame of a match to ignite. That's the concept.     Feel free to contact me through my profile if you need anymore help. You weren't very specific about how you were going to get the wire behind the drywall.|`|V0ltn3Qkaa	moving the stove to another wall will be fine. except of course if the electric for the stove can be moved to the new location.|`|d7af0cf9b2333b5c1df55225a5b30b14aa	You don't have to make a new firewall, but your stove is most likely 220 volts.

However even though tenants do not necessarily have to take care of the lawn, the landlord may not have a duty to mow it regularly, either.    There is an implied warranty of habitability in most jurisdictions meaning the landlord must keep the premises in a habitable condition. Having a yard with high grass probably does not breach that warranty. Unless there is some type of ordinance that would require the grass to be cut, I'd say the landlord wouldn't have to cut it either.

It has an organic feel, rough, original brick work in a rustic state, that contrasts with the smoothness of the leather couch creating a ying and yang feeling.  The room has a contemporary feel to it with a nod to the past, and certainly creates that loft feel with the furnishings, while bringing the room into the present day, it still has a nostalgic feel with the brick wall framed out in drywall and painted a contemporary white.  The white coffee table with is clean lines and smooth feel enhances the loft feeling of the room.

Normally found in metropolitan areas such as New york you will see this in brownstones, penthouses, and a lot of this being used in upscale bachelor pads. Metropolitan design is incorporated by utilizing a little bit of modernity that meets some of the rustic nature of brick or stone elements. It is a beautiful compromise of mixing the natural with the modern for more classy timeless design. This design has more streamlined elements such as furnishings and a more linear look and appeal. Streamlined furniture is more straight lines and uncomplicated architecture. I.E. straight back and arms. Glass in a room is reflective and bounces light as well as being able to see through giving the illusion of greater uninterrupted space from a visual perspective. Leather becomes the anchor of a room due to it's heavy fabric and appearance and balances well against the the glossy or glass of a room for appropriate balance. I love this design as I have used the same concept for homes I have refurbished and rooms I have designed for clients. I hope this helps!

AA11215068	Whether or not Drano really works is a debate I won't get into but suffice it to say it isn't a product I purchase. The drain pipes in your home are usually 4" PVC and you'll need something well beyond Drano or Liquid Plumber if you have something blocking a 4" opening.     The problem with slow drains is typically in the bathroom sink and it's an easy fix. Once a year or so you should take out the sink stopper and the arm that actuates it up and down. You're probably going to find a lot of hair stuck to them. Turn the water on for about a minute to flush the small 1 1/4" plumbing lines and then re-install the stopper. Adjust it so the stopper is raised up on the high side for fast draining of the sink. The bath tub requires the same process.|`|AA11209233	Yes, it can wreck pipes, especially PVC.

AC is all electricity.  That's why the bigger units are run off 220/240 volts.  A gas furnace runs on 110/120.  And the power only runs the fan and components.  If you have an electric heater,  maybe..  Otherwise, AC uses much more power.

4G41Z3RJaa	The problem is that to generate heat you need power.  Electrical power is Voltage times Current.  So to get 120 watts of power, with a 120 volts AC requires 1 Amp, to get 120 watts of power with a 12 volt battery requires 10 Amps.  The next problem is that with DC power you get a significant voltage drop over the connecting wires and the higher the current the higher the voltage drop, and the more loss.  If you are looking to heat something to 100 degress very quickly then you need not hundreds of watts but thousands of watts, especially if the temperature is below freezing.  If I am trying to start my car in the winter I need to draw around 60 Amps from the 12 volt battery or about 720 watts.  It does not take very long to drain a battery if the car does not start quickly.  On a really cold day if the battery has set out all night about 10 minutes.  I assume that you are talking Fahrenheit and not Celsius in temperature.  You would have to check with a supplier to find out how long a heat tape will take to melt snow.  Normally we are talking a period measured in portions of hours or hours depending upon the temperature and the depth of the snow.  If the snow is too deep, then the wire will melt snow and form a cave with the snow above the wire.  Depending upon the surface that the wire is on, you may have difficulties heating it up to 100 degrees at spots while others are at a temperature below freezing.  A shingle roof may handle it, but some plastics or metals may eventually fail.  If you can wait until a sunny day to melt the snow there are passive solar methods to melt snow, maybe you should investigate them.  Also to melt snow, you do not need 100 degrees, even heating to 40 degrees Fahrenheit will melt snow slowly.  I would suspect that if you had an inverter that changes DC to AC with a sufficient number of batteries in parallel that you could run the heat tape for a while to melt snow off of a small object, but then you have to charge the batteries.  You could also consider getting a small gas generator to provide power to the heat tape.  Good luck.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	why not go to the hardware store and buy some heat tape that you wrap around pipes so they don't freeze. build a wood frame to shape it the way it goes and plug it in.i fear a battery won't last long enough to melt too much.
72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	Not sure where you live, but I can tell you that gas furnaces as well as oil furnaces, need to be cleaned and serviced occasionally.  Oil ones need more annual cleaning, gas more occasional.  I would suggest contacting a reputable company that can service your unit and have them do a annual check up at the beginning of heating season any time you notice an orange glow it means the flame is burning inefficiently.  It should be burning blue with little or NO orange in the flames.  It not a hard fix, it usually require a technician who is experienced in making the adjustments and doing a thorough cleaning of the jets and the unit as necessary.  If you can watch what they do when they come, it is possible to maybe learn what they do and determine if you might be capable of doing this on your own.  Personally, some thing I prefer to leave to the professionals!  On an oil furnace, they may need to replace nozzles and do a thorough cleaning, since sludge is usually an ongoing problem with oil burner type furnaces.  Expect to pay from $30-75 for this service, usually dependent on if you have a service contract with them (an additional amount) that may include some services in that amount.  I had one with a company that was $75 annually, but they came out ever year and cleaned my oil burner and could be relied on when the temps went down to come out within 2 hours if the heat system went down for the count.  It didn't matter if it was 2 am on sunday, they came and I never had to pay holiday rates or overtime.  It was a deal, as that system was like 40 years old and when it got cold, it would freeze and the oil couldn't get into the burner.  They would add stuff to it and clean it and whoa!  It would run again!  Now on my HE gas furnace, its still relatively new, so we haven't had to have it serviced yet, but next year it will be due for a check up.  Should run me about $40.  Hope this helps you!  Good luck!|`|bnKPgRlpaa	the led on your furnace should blink a code on the blower ortop door should be a code referance i.e. 3blinks check draft inducer ect. do not open the blower door if you find the codes on the top door this cancels the code .do not shut the system off it will do the same. find the code and you might find the problem hope this helps

If it's very dry, mist it with water first or it will suck the moisture right out of the primer or paint.  Is it removable from the walls?  Personally, I'd take it down if it was.  If you can take it down without much trouble.  And without damaging it much.  You can always refinish it and use it somewhere else.  What kind of species of wood is it?  Pine? Walnut? Oak?

You MUST prime it first, and when you buy the paint, make sure you tell the people at the store what you are painting over so you can get the right paint/primer.  It does look OK, as I have paneling in my son's room, I painted over it with a yellow, and you don't really notice its panel unless you really look at it.  But its way better than looking at old brown panels.  It's less time and money consuming then ripping out the panel and hanging dry-wall.  Its a quick fix for an ugly area.  With the right color, and some patience to make it look flawless, it should look fine for the time being.  Some people hate this idea, while others can work with it.  I think it's fine, as long it's not a main room.... even if... its not horrible.

Wear gloves as this stuff really is brutal on the skin.    After you've de-greased it, you can lightly sand or just go straight to a very good primer.

In addition, I just painted a dark brown paneling in my own family room pure white and it looks great. There are two ways to go here...removing paneling from a wall means you will have to repair or remove the drywall as it leaves substantial damage resulting from tons of paneling nails. First to achieve a fresher look take a good quality primer like KILZ and go over the paneling a couple of time ensuring your paint when applied will be even and have good adhesion. If you like the linear look leave the lines in the paneling and paint like normal. I would recommend Dutch Boy High gloss paint because it gives back the sheen to paneling. Second...If you don't like the linear lines of paneling take drywall compound and a spackle knife, fill them in, wait till dry, lightly sand, paint and voila you would never know there was paneling there. I have used both concepts in many homes I have remodeled as well as designed. I hope this helps! Dutchboy is a great paint for this, as it is thicker and takes better, more evenly to older paneling. Just a head's up...I have used both concepts on older than 50-70+ yr. old paneling with beautiful success. As far as scratches use the above mention method (wall compound) to fill in deep scratches, grooves, etc. let dry and sand before you use KILZ primer then pasint as normal.|`|Rn7Kjwdxaa	I would definitely use the spackling or drywall compound to fill in the joint lines after the initial cleaning and before the primer step.  It will look more like drywall that way.  If you leave the lines it looks like a cheap job to me.  My inlaws have painted paneling in their house and you can tell that it just that, painted paneling.

pnNsRaJlaa	Contact YOUR municipality for guidelines and suggestions. If a compost heap is the path of least resistance then the bears will be attracted so proceed accordingly.|`|81CHTyQoaa	Composters/compost piles should be for yard waste and vegetable kitchen scraps.  It should have grass clippings, leaves, branches trimmed from hedges, dead plant matter, discarded potting soil, vegetable peels/waste, etc. in it--a little shredded paper--not meat scraps, fat, eggshells, dairy, and other stuff.  Properly done, compost piles don't stink.  Larger ones can actually get quite hot.    You might eliminate kitchen waste, but I can't see bears being interested in yard waste.  They have lots of that kind of thing in the woods.

dc047da5f49f04de17b53485f231d982aa	I would get one of those little jewelry cleaner containers and a cotton jewelry cleaner rag and toothpaste. I would lightly brush the toothpaste on then dip in the cleaner wash with hot water then wipe with rag.  Hope you get it clean!|`|PrVtfGhMaa	Being in the business, I would recommend an ultrasonic cleaner only if you have a lot of jewelry to keep clean. If you store them properly, you shouldn't have to be cleaning them all the time.     However, if your jewelry has stones in it, then you must be very careful. Certain stones should never go into an ultasonic. Never put soft stones in there. Never, ever put opals in an ultrasonic. Also if your jewelry has antiquing on it, the ultrasonic will take it off. It may take a while, but it will take most of it off.     Then you are stuck with having to have it sand blasted and re-antiqued. Stones above a hardness level of 7 should be alright for brief periods. Always be sure to rinse your piece of with good clear water.    Never go after your jewelry with a brush. But warm, soapy water is good. Though, I'd lose the ammonia and never use vinegar if the piece has antiquing. Vinegar is acidic and will tarnish sterling silver if not cleaned off propmtly.    Is it a worthwhile investment? That's a judgement call. But they sure as hell clean glasses well, I'll tell you that.....|`|V9tE5daqaa	Try using a desktop ultrasonic jewelry cleaning machine. I am a jewelry purchasing agent that travels all over the world and every factory uses ultrasonic machines to clean jewelry. They usually come with some soap too!    That, along with a cleaning/polishing cloth and you should be stellar!

Oq5a5hRhaa	Duvet covers are usually only meant for down comforters. Down comforters are smaller than regular comforters, so the duvet cover probably wouldn't fit.    The sheet idea may work. What you'll need to do is take measurements of the length and width of the comforter that you wish to cover, and then buy sheets or a duvet cover that is larger.    The sheet idea would probably be cheaper though. If you go this way, you'll have to find a store that sells flat sheets individually (most stores don't). Your best bet would be to try somewhere really cheap (like Walmart) or somewhere really expensive (like The Company Store). Your average department store isn't going to have single flat sheets.    I would personally avoid microfiber, as it will be sweatier than 100% cotton.

joiacDUdaa	You might want to use a grout and tile stripper and reseal the finish.  You can buy tile/grout stripper at most home improvement stores... However, it's very, very caustic to work with so I would do it when you have adequate ventilation... Then you can clean it with a stiff brush and some diluted bleach water.  We sell handled bristled brushes for around $5 to make the job easier.. Rinse well it should look pretty good.. If it's the mosaic tiles you may want to have someone regrout the area to keep the tiles from coming up...|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Clorox Clean-up, will help with getting the dirt out of the grout.

I think you would be better off taking another look at high end Formica. It comes in patterns that have texture and deep colors.  It is relatively cheap to buy and install.

AA10648704	Either buy or rent a tiller to begin with.  The first time will be especially hard if that area's not been tilled before, especially if it's grassy.  Figure out the area you want to plant, then till it up in rows.  After you're finished, do it again the opposite direction to help break up any remaining dirt.  A neat trick for your tomatoes, peppers and squash--put down black plastic where you want to plant.  fasten it down, then cut X's where you want to plant the plants (bigger holes for seeds, and watch them to be sure they don't grow under the plastic).  Use landscaping staples (a "U" shaped piece of wire works, too), at each X to keep the plastic from covering the plant.  The plastic will not only keep out weeds, it will also hold in heat and moisture.  And I always use Miracle-Gro For Tomatoes when I plant both the tomatoes and peppers (also eggplants), since they're in the same family.|`|YaeG1cjhaa	easiest no-dig gardens http://www.squarefootgardening.com/ You control the soil while not breaking your back.

We started ours and it seems to be doing really well. When we moved into our house this fall, the old owners had 2 trash containers and we only needed one so we now use one for our compost. We first put some grass clippings into the trash bin then we simply started to put all of our food waste on top. We eat a lot of seafood and the shells are great for the compost and so are bananas and egg shells . Whenever I start cooking I lay out a piece of old newspaper on the counter and any scraps or pieces that are not used or are waste or left overs from days ago that no one will eat I simply toss them onto the newspaper and then dump it into the trash bin. Over the winter we haven't cut the grass much but once we do we will add some of the clippings to the compost bin. Also we plan to buy worms to add to the bin. The worms will eat all of the food rests and make great soil. I hope this at least helps with getting your compost started. Good luck and Good Fruits!

72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	It is possible to undo some of the damage by having mixed the two.  There are some products out there to rid clothes of unwanted color at Walmart, Target and the like.  I have on occassion, found an unwanted color mixed in my whites, or a white in my darks.  First advice, do not dry it in the dryer until you have it back to what you can live with.  I have used a light bleach solution (Oxy Clean is only good on organic type stains!).  I start the wash with soap and then after everything is mixed, add a diluted 1/4-1/2 cup of bleach in a gallon of water and add it in.  Once it has all mixed in thoroughly, I stop the cycle and let it soak for 1/2 hour to an hour and then resume.  I once had one little shirt that got the dark treatment and it was brand new.  So since it was a highly colored shirt mixed in with black things, it got this fudgey murky looking look to it.  So every time I had a load of clothes that were lightly colored, I threw it in.  It got washed like 10 times.  But it did come bright FINALLY.  Just try the easy stuff first and work up to harsher methods if you must.   Hope this helps you!

The simplest would be to use a good quality oil.  That would be the simplest future maintenence also.    Water-based varnishes are good in that they do not darken the wood, but they are all not good for wear and tear, inc. ones that claim to be 10 times stronger.  There is only one floor varnish I use and it is an expensive two-pack one called sadolin pv67, but you have to know what you are doing to apply it, it will darken the wood (as will all oil-based varnishes) and although it will last the longest, it will eventually need redoing; meaning completely resanding.  Sadolin PV67 could last fifteen years or two years depending on the punishment it gets (no stiletto heels or dragging furniture across it).    Easiest, if not the best looking, is oil.  It is easy every couple of years to add another coat of oil.  No special skill required.|`|KFagjt8Jaa	Just wax will be enough but you will have to re-apply it frequently, possibly annually, and it wont offer much impact protection. There are many purpose-made floor sealants and varnishes on the market so choose the one you want and apply it according to the manufacturer's instructions.       Just remember that if you decide apply a stain before waxing or sealing, remember that they get a lot darker as they dry so don't be tempted to put too many coats on
Tvcn83Adaa	Scrub under the sink and soap it up with Dawn dish soap (by the far the best I've found to get oil up) and rinse it well with as hot of water as you can handle.     To get the smell out, take a large microwave safe container fill it with water and add lemon juice, the smellier the mess the more juice I add.  Zap it until it is boiling, then place the bowl under the sink and close the door.  Once the lemon juice cools off, then remove and wipe down the cupboard.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I hear you with the over sensitivity to smells while pregnant.

n560blqraa	Be very careful when choosing this color option b/c it can have the appearance of Christmas. Black or charcoal grey or light grey colorations on a house are much more suited to a red front door and red flower boxes and shutters as it gives a more subtle timeless element with greater curb appeal, as well as resale value down the line. Try perhaps also looking into a lighter shade of green with more yellow, brown undertones to compliment your roof color like Chatham Green made by Glidden which works beautifully against red or a cranberry wine colored door, and shutters. Rule of thumb...unless a door is wood then paint it the same color as your shutters for a more cohesive look. I am a home remodeler, designer and have used this color combination many times over with great results of a timeless, classy design with great resale value. Good Luck!|`|AkFag8tNaa	That sounds great! I like split levels but they can have a very dated look if you're not careful and that sounds like a great combo!|`|jkgl9WMgaa	I think that sounds great. If you are unsure, cut some plywood in the basic shapes of the house/shutters/boxes/door and then paint the colors you are thinking of.  If you decide you like it, then great...you are ready to go.  But if you decide you hate it, you will not have wasted all that time and energy painting a huge house only to have to repaint.|`|M3kI4KTMaa	I like the black window box idea.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	If your pressure is too high in your house,  you're going to have problems constantly with your taps and such.  The pressure coming into your home should be about 50-80psi.  No higher.  You can test it by purchasing a pressure gauge and attaching it to your garden hose spigot and turning it on.  It will tell you your exact pressure.   If it is higher the 80psi,   you should install an in-line pressure regulator.  They're factory set at 55psi,  but it's adjustable.  You can bury it anywhere on your main line.  Just put a box around it so you have access to it.  And remember,  volume and pressure are two different things.  You can have very little water coming out and still have high pressure.  And vice-versa.  Lots of water, but little pressure.  Test it first to be sure.  If you're just getting too much volume at the faucet,  install an aerator on the spout.    All the best.|`|evItC2KQaa	Assuming you have a shut off valve under your sink you can partially close it till you get the desired pressure.|`|47SIvMjlaa	n0T 0n y04r 1if3

Can't say if it will be cheaper to replace the motor or to replace the unit depends on what brand you have.    On the up side get a pro to look at it and give you an estimate for repair/replacement. Lighting damage is covered by your home owner's insurance. So your insurance should pay all or part of the cost of fixing it.|`|AA11595360	honey lightning hit the motor|`|78f0791e6f413b8585f95e827acbae15aa	are the sensors working?  it can be just the chain or i think the motor had died.|`|ZW8b76ppaa	no|`|EFtsB2cEaa	im sorry it took me so long to answer i was at work. if the power went out, and you disconnected the opener, and used it manually, and when the power came back on, make sure you reconnected back with trolley, if you see the chain or belt moving but the door does not then the trolley is not engaged. if the chain or belt does not move, you may need a circuit board due to a power surge. you stated that it clicks or hum ms when opening make sure the drive trolley is not hung up on the bolts on the rail , and it has surpassed its limit due to the power surge
gFHTcIc8aa	You can put down a pre-emergent to prevent it from growing in the first place.  Dimension (a pre-emergent herbicide) will work, if applied at the right level. The label will tell you exactly the amount that needs to be applied. But you must establish pre-emergent barrier at least a few weeks before germination. (This depends on your climate)   Chickweed can be sprayed with a post-emergent herbicide but due to its extensive root system, it's difficult to get rid of all of it.  You may have spray more than once.    I usually put down Dimension in early Mar. or Late Feb. and this will prevent 90% from germinating and the rest I spray with a liquid herbicide post-emergent on this early spring & sometimes late fall germinating weed.|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Any broadleaf herbicide will do the trick. Make sure you apply properly to avoid burning your grass. Home Depot or Lowes has plenty to choose from. Don't waste your money on weed and feed fertilizer, it's overpriced and doesn't work that good. Also, a good pre-emergent herbicide will prevent the weed seeds from growing for about 90 days. Pendimethyline, Barricade and Dimension are good ones. Get those at Home Depot also.|`|b9wICW1Paa	I'm sure roundup or any other would do the trick.  Vinegar (straight or solution) might also work.    But I would ask you to reconsider your need to chemically treat for a moment.  Chickweed is a highly nutritious wild edible with a very pleasant taste.  If you garden (or even if you don't), you might be interested in using the plant for your daily nutrient requirements.  Of course, if you commonly treat your lawn with herbicides then this would not be a good idea.    You could always pull it and toss it in with the landscape waste.  Or pull it and prepare for your salad or cooked greens.|`|NJULnXiyaa	I have a chickweed problem in my front lawn since its shady most of the year. Most of your common broadleaf herbicides for lawns work fine.  Chickweed is a cool weather weed and sprouts in the late fall. Next fall you could try applying a preemergent herbicide (the same stuff you put down in the late spring for crabgrass control) to nip it in the bud.    -Brian
07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	The most likely is inadequate insulation and poor ventilation. They result in more of your house's heat getting into the attic and being trapped there. That heat melts the snow on the roof. One way to judge that is to see whether you see unmelted areas where the rafters are which would prove that the heat is coming directly through from the attic to the roof.    One other possibility to keep in mind - do you have a roof that has a long side oriented to the south - that always tends to be sunnier and more prone to melting snow from the roof.|`|sbKWMMv9aa	you're HOT|`|gwK4jolhaa	Yep, You need to take a look in your attic.

You should check to see how much insulation in the space between your living space and the roof.  An increase in insulation will cut the coast of heating also.
n560blqraa	You cannot take normal spray paint and spray over chrome. You need to opt for spray paint exclusively made for metals like Rustoleum spray paint. Normal spray paints will not adhere to metal surfaces.There is also Cosmichrome spray that will spray over chrome that is a hybrid paint allowing for full coat adhesion to anything metal. There is also a product called Mirrachrome sold for chrome on motorcycles and cars automotive grade. Hope this helps!|`|53nnzpBxaa	any of them if you sand it.   l
OTBYJtKkaa	The noticeable buzz when the auxiliary heat is on is most likely from the contactor for the electric heat elements. This could be because the 24 volt transformer is not correctly wired for the correct primary voltage. Most hvac units today have a transformer capable of using multiple primary voltages. Those voltages are typically 120 volts, 208 volts, 230 volts and 460 volts. Most residential units will use either 208 or 230 volts. If your transformer is connected for 230 volts (this is the voltage most transformers are connected from the factory for) and you only have 208 volts, the magnetic field being created in the contactor coil will be weaker than it is intended to be. That will usually result in a chattering or buzzing contactor. The fan continuing to run could be from what is referred to as welded contacts. Each time the contacts close or open, there is a moment when the actual metal surfaces of the contacts are almost closed and a small spark of electricity can jump that gap. If the transformer is wired incorrectly as I suggested earlier, the amperage being demanded will be slightly more than it would be if correctly wired. That increased amperage can actually melt the surface of the contacts because of the spark and they can then cool down and stick together. If that is the case, either a new contactor will be needed or at the least, a new set of contacts will need to be installed in the contactor. Working with electrical controls is not something you should attempt yourself unless you are familiar with the process. Most electrical control components are sold at hvac supply houses which will only sell to licensed hvac contractors. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but they are far and few between. You may be able to purchase transformers or contactors from WW Grainger, which will sell directly to the public. You will need to know the correct information for those components, such as the transformer's voltamp rating, the primary and secondary voltages, what type of mount it has, etc. For contactors, you must know the amperage it is rated for, how many poles it requires and the voltage the coil is designed to operate with. As I said, this is not something you as a layman can normally take care of on your own. If you know someone that works in the hvac field, you would be better served to have them assist you with the job. There are a number of hvac supply houses such as Johnstone Supply, United Refrigeration, CC Dickson, RE Michels, MIngledorfs and many others. Often times you can find someone at one of the supply houses that can help you on the side with the work. I hope this helps.|`|bff8176a9e09f8072e70e345d10362a8aa	call some ac co in your area tell them the situation i myself have gone on some calls for ederly people and just charged them for the parts we are in this biz to make a living but we do have a heart|`|hWdSTmfDaa	sounds like fan relay is bad but make sure transformer is putting out 24 volts.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Anyone would have to look at it to tell you exactly what's wrong with it.  Or you'd have to give a LOT more info.  Electric dryers are fairly simple.  There's not much that can go wrong.  Typically, the elements burn out.  With gas units,  it really could be anything.  The most common problem that I've encountered are igniters (ignitors?) that wear out; won't get hot enough to ignite the gas.  But really, if you haven't done work like this before, and aren't sure what you're doing, call a licensed repairman.  I'm not trying to be mean or question your abilities or anything,  it's just that gas and electricity can hurt or kill you.  With plumbing, you'd just get wet.  Some things you can do are check to make sure the gas valve hasn't been shut off accidentally.  Check the vent line for obstructions such as a lint clog, and make sure the trap door is working properly if it has one.    Another thing to consider is:  10yrs makes the unit about middle-aged.  You should ask yourself if you want to put money into something that may or may not last much longer...

L8zmQS8Jaa	In the first place these come in several different configurations depending upon if they are one two or three pieces.  A one piece unit would not have seams and you would be thinking of caulking a crack not a seam.  I don't think this is the case and will assume that you have a two or three piece unit that has a seam you are thinking of caulking.      The units are designed to expand and contract separately.  They are supposed to move at the seams.  So the short answer is that they are are designed to be leak proof without caulk at the seams (there is an overlapping.)  The mfg does not want you to caulk because it may interfere with the expansion and contraction putting stress on the unit that may lead to premature failure of the entire system.      There might be several reasons why it is leaking.  1. if it was always leaking the installer cracked the back of the overlapping joint most likely by putting a screw in too tight.  Water is then able to flow through the seam.  2. you have a water jet directed at the seam in such a way that it is forcing water uphill and causing the seam to leak.      You might check to see if the seam is leaking by taping over it with duct tape.  If it stops leaking you have your answer.  Check for the badly directed jets and then consult with the mfg.  Without seeing the setup it is hard to determine what alternatives there are to caulk. ("silicone I or silicone II)|`|pq8spEdxaa	hi    if you cannot identify a obvious reason for the leak, ie manufacture fault, then use some silicon sparingly to seal the stall

ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	i have been with both British gas and Npower, npower are slightly cheaper than British gas, the best i found was southern electric. i am with EDF on a price plan frozen til dec 09 but you have missed those deals i expect.|`|GPrw1JZkaa	Its a mine field out there to say the least! i am paying a really high price for both gas and electric so i tried the comparison sites which made me even more confused.   i did a lot of reading and some say that even if you change and it's cheaper , then next year it will go up again and possibly be higher than before, so i am in the same boat as yourself, i really don't know what to do. i wish there was an actual person who was impartial out there to help us.  sorry i can't be of more help to you.|`|4048ad82d67909905629720173b0aa1caa	try ENERGYLINX|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	at the moment maybe,because they have just downed their tariffs.but i,d hold on as others will follow suit and will be cheaper.like for like i,ve always found b.gas as one of the most expensive and unreliable.that is of course my opinion.there are a lot of compare sites now.type in your search engine gas and electricity compare and you can take your choice.but don,t  take a tie in option as they eventually lean to your suppliers side.do regular checks as you can change easily and often at no cost to you.        hope this helps|`|bE3DFelQaa	Hi mate    I have just joined a company who are 10-15% cheaper than the other big 6 suppliers and have won which magazine awards for the best value. The thing is, they don't advertise, instead they go on word of mouth and recommendations.  Gas and electricity is still provided by one of the big 6 suppliers but because they buy in bulk at a reduced rate and don't have advertising costs, they pass the savings onto the customer.  I was recommended to them an haven't been with them too long, but a few advantages to this company is its a plc company, on the London Stock Exchange, all utilities come on one monthly bill, UK based customer service (they've won awards for this calls answered within 15 seconds!) and not tied into a contract so its risk free.    I used to be with Npower purely because Supermarket but them on top but I didn't realise at that time that npower pay switch and mopneysupermarket commission so its not ultimately the best deal.  I remember once that i was on the phone waiting to speak to someone for an hour one day hence the reason I changed.      Thought I would make you aware of the and if you want anything further then let me know.    Rob
6dQT8uM3aa	I would advise to put the most affordable option since you are moving. A counter top from home depot is not exactly the best or the cheapest but if installed properly looks nice. A custom counter top made on real wood and finished with a high gloss finish granite like Mica would be the best within the affordable. Wood is a selling point since the counter will last longer than a counter top made with particle board. If you were to stay in your house I would recommend granite. in wood laminated with mica you could get someone to do it between 600 to 1500max. for a 10 x 12 plus installation. Granite will be more. I have remodeled houses and sold them to see the new owners rip the new carpet off and throw away something i thought was a plus. I shouldn't have made that expense.  good luck!|`|ip5EWw7uaa	Granite every time - big slabs not tiles (fGs).   6 years is plenty of time to enjoy it.  Get a fairly neutral stone, though no brown/reds for example.     (Just put them in a house which is up for 12.5m)    If you don't think it stacks up - you could go for solid hardwood or stainless steel.    Shop around - you can get deals on the bit of stone that is left over from a major job, or even salvage - I recall it was possible to buy large sheets of granite from South Quay Plaza after it was wrecked by a bomb. (Admittedly not an everyday occurrence).|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	Although you are not in an expensive neighborhood, if you can afford granite, go for it.  Even those people who don't know much about home decor se it on TV and know that it is desirable. Kitchens sell the house so bear that in mind. If you know the warehouses that sell granite, you could probably get them to give you the granite at a reduced price and all your contractor has to do is measure it for fit.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Since your house is going for 100,000 it's probably better to go with laminate, granite is extremely popular, but needs sealing once a year. Even better ask a realtor in ur area,they'll probably ans, right over the phone. Hate to tell u something and be totally wrong.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Compromise!  Install granite TILES.  It's still granite but at a fraction of the cost of a seamless countertop.  You could install it yourself with a little DIY education and save even more.  But if you still want to go cheaper there really are some very stylish laminate options out there.  Not just plain boring one colors.  They have some that really resemble granite.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Granite. You'll only find granite in all multimillion dollar houses , not laminate. That should tell you something. I have granite in my kitchen and bathrooms, and it's great. Kitchens sell houses, so spend the money there.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Granite is the thing if you can afford it, it will bring a better return.|`|SAK7FKmUaa	My suggestion is to go for the laminate.  You will not get back the full value back that you put in for granite.  Although, it may help if you are trying to sell against other simliar houses in your neighborhood.
Tvcn83Adaa	It is no harsher than other detergents on the market.  In my experience Tide gets out stains the best, and smells great.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Harsh, as you mean to the environment? Been using tide probably longer than you've been alive, how about Gain, heard that smells good to.|`|AA12377116	It may be harsh, I don't really know but if you like just use it.     The chances of your detergent wearing out your clothes before you stop wearing them is not too great.|`|Z5g7hCXraa	I use Country Saver.  I know that's a strange name, but it's for front load washers, low sudsing, inexpensive, and it can clean my hubbie's work clothes.  You won't have the Tide scent, but you don't pay for fillers as with other detergents.  It also doesn't irritate sensitive skin.  I looked it up online, and found I could buy it at several stores, like London Drugs.|`|vigFmfLmaa	I had a horrible (home) hair color job one time and my stylist said that I could wash my hair in Tide a couple times to get it out...it worked too!|`|AA12246425	Tide is the best!!|`|AA10685211	Consumer Reports is always a great place to find answers like these. They test every product there is on how good it works.....or doesn't.    http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index...|`|asGVrqhEaa	Tide is the best! Maybe Gain or Downy? But tide is best.
hdtNLIIwaa	it's her house so her rules.  try to think of some sort of compromise you can do instead.    (a black room is bad for lighting, it will always be dark and may also get annoying after a while)|`|f7qVtYfaaa	tell her that once you are ready to move out of the house you will restore the room look to what she likes|`|zLGOQQs5aa	i just asked my mom if i could paint my walls black of navy and then paint planets and stars and stuff and she was like 'alright. just clean your room first' :)|`|AA11705584	aw thats a cute idea! its hard to convince strict parents unfortunatly. If she wont let you actually paint ask you you can use black wall paper and paint stars onto that :)|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	The few rooms I've seen painted black were really ugly.  Unless we are talking recessed ceiling in a restaurant to hide the mechanicals, using black in a bedroom is not going to be nice at all.  Plus when it's time to repaint, it will be a triple hard getting a new color over it without the black coming thru.      Think of a compromise.  Look at fabric stores for something along the same line.  Maybe you can create a canopy over your bed (you don't need a canopy bed) with the black and stars fabric and then pick a more Mom-acceptable color for the walls and ceiling.  Remember, she pays the mortgage and pays the taxes.  When you own the house, you can paint it what you want.|`|VENJHtyTaa	Here are a few links to rooms with black walls. Some of them may be in a style that your mum likes which might help her consider the modern beauty of black walls. There are a few reasons she may be reluctant to go with them that has nothing to do with the color and everything to do with the challenge of getting them back to a lighter color. Find out WHY she is saying NO, she may have a concern that you will agree with. Also have you considered a compromise of the main wall black and the others pink with opposite color stars?

If they don't have them, and they're any good, they should be able to help get you in touch with a supplier. http://www.showerdoc.co.uk/ should be worth a go, have an order line. Good luck!|`|8d2ea0bba8cb5876b07812fd4f9974f6aa	Call in to your nearest branch of Jewson, they are main agents for Triton, and they will be able to give you the customer service phone number for Triton who you will find very helpful.

e29d777fb797f7ae2bf45ec66d721612aa	wow, ive never read such an agressive question. ;0)    Anyway, try those candles that give off the scent that detracts them. Call the council about the wasps, there must be a nest somewhere or ask a gardener what plants in the garden are attracting them and have them removed.    If there is water nearby, that will attract the midges, if you have a water butt or something, make sure the lid is on it and empty any pots or containers that might collect water.    I hope you sort this out so you can relax and lose some of that pent up aggression ;0)|`|AA12303431	Treat yourself to one of those insectocuters that zap them.

Works every time.|`|7b6cf326833c16de2e02ffcc31092e61aa	Not sure about the wasps (maybe less colourful clothing) midges though I can make a suggestion. Buy some of Avon's Skin So Soft. It is a moisturiser but is probably the most effect midge repellent on the market. All the outdoor workers use it in the National Trusts etc and I believe the British army also use it when in the UK over the summer. And you get wonderfully soft and fragrant skin as a bonus!    Oh, and if you are sweaty or wearing sweaty clothes then take a shower/change as midge seem to be more attracted to the smell of sweat.
AA10759102	yes, very, scale of 1 to 10 i'd say 8.
AA10556829	No there is no way to fix it besides gettin a thick mattress pad or buy a new thicker mattress.
