H3nbC71eaa	I would say the dropkick..especially when it is beautifully executed. Like AJ Styles or Randy Orton. Then you go back to the times when I first started watching and see Ricky Steamboat or The Rockers do it..and it is still an exciting move when it is done very good.|`|JYrvt5s8aa	The toad splash by deddie guessero.|`|6j8d7TZTaa	I just love everything I cant decide which one is the best  In my opinion John Cena is the best wrestler by far.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Chokeslam|`|u9uFdSrqaa	Sweet Chin Music|`|rJMZdp04aa	I'm a fan of the Triple German Suplex.  Especially when done by Kurt Angle or Benoit.    The Shooting Star Press has Always been a Favorite too.  Kidman & Bourne's versions are Awesome.  Brock Lesnar's - Not so Much.    Sweet Chin Music is Great as Well.  Just the Build Up by "Tuning up the Band" is Great.    The Swanton Bomb is Awesome.  Especially when Jeff uses a Ladder ,  or Stage ,   or Scaffold in Extreme Cases.    But the One I'm REALLY a fan of is - The FU (Throwback now I Suppose).  Most People have NO idea how Hard it is to pick someone who ways 500+lbs (Big Show & Viscera) on their Shoulders , Hold them There , and THEN FLIP them over your Head.  Just a showing of TREMENDOUS Physical Strength.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Probabably the superkick such a simple and effecive move when it's done well I always love  it, especially that little snap sound they make with it|`|mDuiiVN7aa	HBKs Sweet Chin Music from 1992 till today!|`|UWJinEbIaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yijR8qCxU...

I have always loved technical wrestling and suplexes in genral. And the belly to belly can be used some many difrent ways in a match and if you do it right it looks beatiful.

dDhTMacAaa	I would like to see him return and I wish him the best, but TNT has already found Gary Payton as a replacement.    Payton was in the studio with C-Webb, Kenny, and EJ on Thursday night and he is a great analyst. I didn't doubt him, but I was surprised by his talent as an analyst.|`|CHdQqxM4aa	did he leave or is he ill     what happenned|`|GBGcI509aa	I hope he comes back.

11i3Xmb1aa	His wife has cancer and he decided to go take care of her so he pushed his career a bit to the side.  But hey he still makes appearances; look at how in the Royal Rumble he came back. But it was a one time thing. I think he will still be coming in like once in a while and wrestle.  I heard before that when his wife is all better he might return to wrestling full time. He said he would chose between TNA or WWE but mostly WWE.    (:|`|e3m3rdNYaa	somebody didnt watch the Royal Rumble...|`|bkxJ3dCraa	If you want watch the royal rumble when RVD came out.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	He let his contract expire and never resigned, but hes on an 'occasional appearance' deal with WWE, meaning he can show up and wrestle the occasional match like he did at the Royal Rumble|`|WK6vrkdKaa	He didnt renew his contract and he got released and he is now taking care of his wife that has cancer..but i think he will come back sometime soon..
H3nbC71eaa	If you really want to know about wrestling..no there isn't..especially with the internet as handy as it is nowadays. You can just look up some things from the past you might not know..look into other promotions other than WWE, or get in touch with some users from here that might know their stuff.    I watched wrestling before there was any internet..before I knew of wrestling magazines and things like that. All I had was the TV, and during that time, cable was very new and I got to watch a good number of wrestling promotions outside of the WWF. AWA, WCCW, USWA, NWA/WCW, WCW right after it left the NWA. I wanted to know about more wrestling, and i was able to just with a TV. If you really want to know about wrestling, there's no excuse now that the internet is here and you have youtube and video sites to watch any of the wrestling you want.    For the record, never trust anything Wiki posts as 100% truth. Some of the stuff there is not on point.|`|smcDn76jaa	Well there is no excuse. The Internet is how I got caught with the other promotions out there. And unlike what many of you think I'm 14, and not blind to everything but WWE. I try to learn a lot about the things that I watch and not just wrestling. Oh and when I use Wiki I usually back up the info with another site.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	Personally I recommend sites like Wrestling Observer (now bundled with figure four online), Online World of Wrestling, and Obsessed With Wrestling. WrestleCrap also has a terrific forum.    However, wrestling is like computers, no matter how much you know, there is always someone who knows that much more.|`|F1oWUJjPaa	Look I'm not dumb alright. I know all about wrestling I've done my research. I am not ignorant to wrestling at all. I've seen legends wrestle live who have since passed away and some people on here don't know anything about. I take wrestling very seriously it's like a second job for me.|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	No, there's no excuse. People have a right to expand on their wrestling knowledge. Myself is finding time to watch old WCCW, AWA, NWA, MLW, WCW, NJPW matches because I wanna know what really goes on in other promotions who give great wrestling and have produce some legends like Muta, Steamboat, Misawa. I wanna know if there's any promotions that I've missed cos I love wrestling. If you love wrestling, there's no excuse for them to look on YouTube and just watch some old matches of classic wrestling|`|QouSk1E7aa	The only "real" excuse would be mental retardation|`|rJMZdp04aa	ABSOLUTELY NOT.  There is NO Excuse for ANYONE (Whether it be 10 year olds to 50 year olds) NOT to Learn Everything you Possibly can about the Sport we all "Supposedly" Love.    I Myself Don't Know Everything (Don't claim that I do) , and neither Does Anyone Else in the WS.  NO ONE knows Everything about Pro Wrestling.  That is The WHOLE Idea.  It was meant as an Illusion.    Granted , some of us DO Know more than others , but that is Not the Point.    The Point is - I have been a fan my Entire Life & I still LOVE learning New Things about Pro Wrestling.  Whether it be WWE History , WCW , The Original ECW , ROH , NJPW , or Any Wrestling Promotion Throughout the World.  I Love the Sport in all it's Facets.  And i want to know AS MUCH as Possible about it,  I find It Truly Fascinating    And Everyone who THINKS they KNow Pro Wrestling because of 2-3 Years of Watching WWE , Need to have a little Respect for Themselves , Other True Fans , & the Business itself by Educating Themselves about the Sport.    Please - I'm Begging You.  LEARN SOMETHING.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	There's been alot of complaining going on today about the wrestling section, and it's getting old. There's always going to be new fans who are unfamiliar with the previous generations happenings. Not everyone was born in 1983. You're a good user. Just stick to wrestling questions.    Edit: For the record, I NEVER use Wiki. Everything I put down is from my brain, and I did admit it, Im not familiar with Muta. I know who he is, but I never really got into his matches, which is why I picked RVD|`|WK6vrkdKaa	There is no excuse for it..not one, if you want to come here you should atleast know something other than "why are they getting boo'ed" or something my dog can figure out..    I can admit to anything that i dont know without feeling bad because i know someone out there will know something about it so ill take what they know and look up more thing to know for myself..|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	rvd RVD i like rvd but the great muta is 10 times better i never saw that question  and i agree wwe is blocking so much of the past out and the younger fans need to know this stuff and maby thell ask decent questions some of these ppl dont know who andre the giant is and havent seen his WM3  match with hogan and im fed up with the crappy questions by the younger users and fed up with there crappier ansers

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	It's probably both tbh as Taker's gimmick is legendary and was one of the highlights of the Attitude Era.His gimmick has been consistently entertaining over the years and Taker continues to work an exciting style of technical powerhouse MMA-influenced wrestling and can work entertaining matches.    http://video.aol.com/video-detail/the-un...|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I think he's a brilliant wrestler who has been blessed with a great gimmick.  He is exceptionally skilled as a performer and showman and has proven himself time and time again in the ring against all superstars.  That's my opinion anyway.  All superstars along his gimmick style e.g. Papa Shango have had very short lifespans but he has managed to maintain in pulling a crowd like no other superstar.|`|AA12022123	niether he is crap but if i had to choose i would have to say its his gimmick and everyne knows it cuz he would be nothing without the "dead man" gimmick|`|JBQhWhQnaa	the business would not be were it is today without the undertaker he is a good wrestler one of the best he is the top dog in the wwe|`|bnm9BfxDaa	if he wasn't the deadman i still would have liked him and he still would have been awesome!! he is tall and flexible. he has not only power but speed and agility. and he has so many moves. he has 4 finishers!!! the chokeslam, tombstone, ride from hell, and the submission move. he also has the old school. many many moves that are exciting and never get old. so he is not crap. john cena only uses like 5 boring moves over and over in every match|`|NQkRzBtJaa	The Undertaker has the best gimmick of all time in my opinion. His gimmick is one of the reasons why the WWE is as successful as it is today. He will go down in history as one of the biggest legends of all time from the WWE. However as far as his wrestling skill goes The Undertaker is not that good. The only reason why he looks good in the ring is because of his big size and strength. His actual wrestling ability is not that impressive compared to other big superstars like Bret Hart or Kurt Angle.

rseD4OG2aa	I think that the big problem is, and I'm really speaking of WWE here, that to much focus is put on the main event world championships. Over half the program, both RAW and Smackdown, is devoted to matches, promos, PPV hyping, and the announcers talking about the big main event title bouts. There's noting wrong with that, but after a while it does detract a bit from the tag and IC/US belts. I mean, when your tag and mid card champions don't even appear on on the show most of the time, it's tough to keep them relevant.  I think that RAW is really fixing that problem now. John Cena is having a great world title reign without it dominating the rest of the show. He's still putting on great matches and working a terrific program with Shawn Michaels and JBL, but it isn't dominating everything else. John Morrison and The Miz are a fantastic tag team, and because management has toned down the emphasis on the world title, they have time to show it buy working longer matches and cutting good promos that last longer than 20 seconds. It's worked for reviving the Intercontinental belt as well.  I think that that is the biggest thing WWE needs to implement if they want the tag team titles to stay relevant. With all the focus on the main events, why would any talented wrestlers want to work in the tag team divisions.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	Tag teams are a dying bread unfortunately. They just don't seem to be worked on like they used to. For TNA Beer money is a great tag team, 3-D as well. In the WWE? Deuce and Domino I thought were a great team, but they aren't around anymore. I guess the best WWE has to offer right now is the Miz and Morrison and Cryme Tyme.|`|JiCfYfLraa	i would make sure that a lot of tag teams get pushes and not lame gimmicks like jesse and festus,thats a damn disgraceful tag team i would break that tag team up. i would also change cryme times attire because wrestling in jeans and timberland boots is just a stereotype and its ridiculous. the tag team division needs to focus  more on being a tag team then trying to get fans attention and having gimmicks. look at miz and morrisionthey are like the best tag team ever they dont have a lame gimmick and they also dont worry about getting the fans attention they just go in there and wrestle,and look they have alot of fans its because they dont worry about them. look at the hilanders,they were probably the worst tag team ever and they had no popularity why because all they worried about was getting fans attention and they never got it. also i would make sure they stay as tag teams because the wwe let the tag team last for about 6 months and thats it. the tag team division isnt the same like the best because you had tna,the hardyz,dudley boys,the radicialz,the acoliytes and many more great tag teams.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I would bring people up as a tag team and leave them as a Tag Team, the WWE brings people up as singles guys then puts them together as a tag team. We need more teams like Cryme Tyme, tag teams with Chemistry...|`|H3nbC71eaa	Give the spotlight to teams that are actually tag teams. In WWE's case..at least Miz & Morrison and Primo and Carlito can be considered actual tag teams. In that sense having the titles on both those teams is a start. They need to have more tag teams that can actually tag wrestle, and bring in some exciting young tag teams that can highlight the double teaming and tag coordination aspect of tag wrestling.  TNA is doing a better job of their tag teams..but they need to let the talent shine also..the Motor City Machine Guns should've held those belts by now.  Add more time to their tag matches..and don't just stick two wrestlers together and call them a tag team...it takes more than that to be a good tag team.
KIOR56r6aa	To me, a phenomenal wrestler is a wrestler who lives in the fans hearts' and will never be forgotten. Stand in their own class. And of course have a successful career. And they made something different, they contribute something to the business.    And just like the other answers said, the perfect example for a phenomenal wrestles are Ric Flair, The Undertaker, and Shawn Michaels.    BQ : Brawler. Cause brawlers rock!!|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I think a great Wrestler needs to be able to use the same gimmick as a face and as a heel. People like Shawn Michaels, he is the Heart Break Kid as face and the Heart Break Kid as a heel. The Undertaker is the Dead Man as a Face and as a heel. if you can do that, you will cement your place in wrestling history.    Also, as a heel you need to be able piss people off with words and your action, not just one or the other.

Mike skills are not important outside of WWE and TNA, but they are still good to have, unless it's in Japan or Mexico, where most of the people don't speak English.

AJ Styles takes high flying and Ariel moves to a new level without being what you would call a Luchadore. Bryan Danielson is another one that just stands out for being better than everyone else as a technical wrestler.     BQ: Lucha Libre... believe it or not would be my favorite style because no matter who is doing it or how well it is still very exciting to watch. there isn't a style i don't like but Lucha stands out as a favorite.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	for me it how they did in the fans eyes! if they were heels then they need to get heat and if they were babyfaces then they should been fan fav's!|`|nQHkkR8Raa	Apart from good looks...     Wrestling ability. They need to have great matches, a good set of moves, and wrestle well.     Entertainment. They need to do great promos, great acting backstage, and entertain well.      Media. They need to handle the media well and stuff.     Schedule. They need to always be ready for everything they need to be.     Championships. I know it is kayfabe, but winning a lot makes you popular, and then you can become a legend, a phenomenal wrestler. You can't be one of the best without winnin anything.      Most important i'd say are wrestling ability, championships to go with that and entertainment. These are key to get fans, which are so important, if they don't like you, how do you become the best. Don't entertain, you don't get fans, don't wrestle well, same again.   To me it's one big chain.     BQ. Highflying style. It's the most entertaining, risk taking and just looks class!

XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:    Base Strength   1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats   2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts   3: Lunges   4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches)   5: Stretching    Transitional Power:   1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats   2: Power Cleans   3: Push Press   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    Explosiveness:   1: Ballistic and jump squats   2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics   3: Sprinting   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...

u2H68wiaaa	If Undertaker does not wrestle Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania, I'd like to see him wrestle Vladimir Kozlov.  It appears the Kozlov will retain his unpinned streak into Wrestlemania.  This would set up a streak vs. streak situation.  Kozlov's unbeaten streak against Undertaker's Wrestlemania streak.  These two had a good match on Smackdown several months ago which was cut short due to interference.  I'd love to see them go at it again with a clean finish.|`|mBDIniTxaa	Well.

Jeff Hardy- That one I would watch but they would have to be creative with that story line.  Chris Jericho- Boring as hell, again I can already predict the story line and the match itself.  Umaga- Are you kidding me? Boring.  Cena- Refer to Triple H    I think they are trying to make it between Show and Undertaker. Boring.    I know its out of the box and way out of line but I would kind of like to see Undertaker and Boogyman... a story line with it, Boogyman terrorizing the Undertaker and Taker terrorizing the Boogyman. I can kind of see a Mankind Vs Undertaker kind of deal with that.|`|1YrHkxKvaa	I don't really care who it is as long as it's not a title match again, 3 years in a row would be too much|`|ayFd2u7naa	The only one on the list I can see working a match with Taker at wrestlemania is HHH.

H3nbC71eaa	It all depends on what is more important to the wrestler. If main eventing Wrestlemania for a World title is more important then the Rumble match is better.    If all you want is the opportunity to have a World title then Money in the Bank.    Money in the Bank gives you the most opportunity to win a World title if you're the winner of the match, but IMO Royal Rumble is the match that usually creates a superstar at Wrestlemania. It all boils down to what is more important to the wrestler.    I'll go with RR for me, because it's a chance of a lifetime to main event at Wrestlemania...that can likely take you to the next level in star status.|`|xPy6ZePkaa	Money in the Bank because you can have your match anywhere at any moment and anytime. Just look at CM Punk, Batista beat the crap out of Edge then Punk comes out and cashes it in for the easy win since Edge can't really defend himself. Winning the Royal Rumble on the other hand you have a set match at WrestleMania. Sure your getting a main event match at the grand-daddy stage on them all, but your chances of gaining the title are not as good.|`|GRoOEkNeaa	I think both, but I mostly pick MITB.|`|UzHt495Saa	BOTH.it's a Useless win for the Rumble or MITB winner,if he just looses the title opportunity.take CM Punk,he won the briefcase,he won the title but he held it for too short,take Undertaker in rumble 2007,he won the rumble and he won the title match at wm24.cena was unlucky because he won the rumble 2008 but orton just defeated the sh*t out of HHH and CENA,where everybody thought that ORTON will loose because CENA was involved in that match.|`|0P40aUA0aa	Money In The Bank|`|f4nS2Mmbaa	I would have to say Money in the Bank is better. think about it, if u win the rumble, u go to main event Wrestlemania for a title shot. but, if ur Mr. MITB, you get a title show whenever, for any title. u can even do it at WM. So Money in the Bank is better, hands down.    thanks(:|`|w5GMjQndaa	I'm going with $$Money in the Bank$$ Rather than fighting off 29 other guys, you have to fight off 5 or how many the wwe cranked it up to. In mitb you can "cash" in the briefcase whenever you want, opposed to royal rumble win you can only use its only good for one night|`|ecwhBLnxaa	Money in the Bank|`|zhXFtgPqaa	Money In The Bank, sure you get a main event title spot at that year's WrestleMania, but if you have patience you could cash in MITB and the next years WrestleMania. The good thing about MITB is that you can cash it in whenever and wherever you feel like it.    Plus the briefcase can come in handy in more ways than just cashing it in.|`|Agsp62ttaa	Money in the Bank.    I mean, look at what Edge did- He got titles twice by cashing in just after the original titleholder had finished a bad match, even after an elimination chamber match. Best plan ever!|`|7PyguvVgaa	The Royal Rumble, main eventing at the "grandaddy of them all,"  nuff said.  Everyone will remember that, but no one cares if somebody wins the title at judgment day.  Even if you lose, being able to main event at Wrestlemania is everything.|`|9YHkImB9aa	Royal rumble because you are guarantied a title shot at wrestle mania and the title shot is for a world championship and you get to pick what you want.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	Royal Rumble is! because less thing they can do with a contract!|`|nQHkkR8Raa	Money in the bank because ...     As been said, only fight 5 or 6 instead of 29 max. You don't have to have a match at wm. Have it anytime you like. You can cash it in anytime you like, even straight after a title match. You get the nickname mr money in the bank too, what a bonus!|`|JiCfYfLraa	the money in the bank because you can cash it in at anytime. the royal rumble you cant hold on to it you fight at wrestlemania and the money in the bank you hold on to that sucka as looooong as you want to. hell you can cash it in a whoop the champion in there hotel room lol.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Money in the bank.|`|ePvvGUu3aa	Money in the Bank, no question on that. When you win the Money in the Bank, the contract is in your power for up to a year. You can even main event WrestleMania on that same night by cashing it in. The bright side about it is, there's only seven other wrestlers who will fighting for it also at the same time. While at the Rumble, if you get the early draw, luck has basically escaped you. In the Money in the Bank, you have the better opportunity as you can wait for time and let the other wrestlers sacrifice their bodies, while your waiting for the right moment. The other positive about it is the fact that you can use it at an advantage whenever the champion is already weak (example of how Edge and Punk did it). That basically sums it all up, but I can say the Rumble does guarantee a spot at WrestleMania, while the Money in the Bank guarantees an open slot for up to a year.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	The Money in the Bank ladder match is fast taking over as the most important match for young stars on the edge of the main event picture. The royal rumble has being used in recent years to make sure a big star was in the wrestlemania main event instead of it being an opportunity for anyone to step into the main events in WWE so for that reason i think i have to pick the Money in the Bank as the bigger opportunity because it is only won by people who are ready to main event instead of a big name winning it to create a good/great match at wrestlemania.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	money in the bank|`|e3m3rdNYaa	MITB, because you get the shot any time you want, and you only have to fight off 5 other guys instead of 29|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	rr is more prestigeos but money in the bank is better for your carrer after all every single one who cashed in there case won a whc|`|PaWcj0AIaa	money in the bank but the the royal rumble is a match more prestigious honor because you are in the ring with 30 men and in money in the bank you climb the ladder and hang on to the case so ay money in the bank all the way because you can cash it in anytime|`|bdiuW66paa	as some times there is a chance that u might not go to main event of mania as u fight in no way out or u get a triple threat match at mania.

sd65CtLYaa	There's a number of things to do:    1. Improve your jump shot and be ready to shoot when you catch the ball.  2. Drive to the basket more.  You'll be more likely to get fouled and get some free-throws.  3. Set Screens - The screener is often forgotten so you can get more looks.  4. Get more offensive rebounds - they often lead to easy put-backs.  5. Move without the ball in general.    There's a basketball scoring tips page on basketball-tips-and-training.com that can help you out more.|`|XrCc85kNaa	I suggest you stop wearing a football helmet....that would be a start..|`|802Qh1Tbaa	Work on you're rebounding and hanging out around the basket when a shot goes up. Collecting a few offensive rebounds each game will give you a great chance at a few put backs.|`|AA10248312	Drive to the hoop more, get to the foul line.  That will not only help you, it will help your team, as you get your opponents in foul trouble and over the limit.    When you see an NBA game and a great player is having an off night shooting from outside, they try to play through the slump by driving to the hoop.    If they play off of you, go ahead and shoot it...if you're a shooting guard, that's why they pay you the big bucks!  Once a few of your shots start to fall, you won't be as nervous any more.  Not being nervous out there is just a matter of gaining experience and court time.  But make sure you're within your range when you shoot it...you don't want to take shots that hurt your team.

Last year songs were much better.|`|trvqktw3aa	I LOVE ACDC but i do agree the songs are ad choices I would have gone with Big Gun or Thundertruck or Rock n Roll Train     There and Back Again by Daughtry would be my choice I always wanted this to be a Mania theme song    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQeosbQBS...|`|cdd147902e81bc55214600dbc4c6afbfaa	I would'nt say they suck.

ZAh8CEoGaa	20 year anniversary of the team maybe.|`|wzCexNZtaa	20th year anniversary|`|I3jXJEyAaa	use common sense. its how many years the team has been around. just like how the bobcats have 5 on their jersey|`|3ioKL0hfaa	ya pretty sure it is the 20th anniversary
D7zcNRB2aa	Because they're using all of their energy to play defense.|`|XrCc85kNaa	I guess thats where the mental aspect of the game comes in....|`|98wFqBwSaa	Because they're scrubs|`|GBGcI509aa	Who cares.
xt00f5Qoaa	we would be destorying everyone in the league except the thunder because all our star players get sick on the say of that game.|`|PSMsDalLaa	bad.    Iverson takes too many shots, Camby and garnett do similar things although garnett is better, and randy foye is crap.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	9/10|`|I2I843Myaa	Awesome team.|`|9GXxvfnOaa	PG Mo Williams just too underrated  SF LeBron James  C   Yao Ming  the rest are fine  how do they tie?  and with the THUNDER!  try tieing with the cavs at least|`|bABkMrADaa	That would be good because carmelo and allen will do the scoring and kg and marcus would do defence and rebound, but its to hard to get that team because of the salarys|`|J4xsLrnoaa	celtics would kill them(KG,celtic)|`|GBGcI509aa	Yeah it would be pretty good.|`|vFthoB6Haa	i don't like your PG and your C...what's your team for, anyway?|`|3IMxX1GGaa	your team is okay but not that good...  here are the reasons why:    1. Randy Foye will give you the hardest time in field goal %, he will literally shoot 20 shots per game and miss most of them.    2. Allen Iverson is having a major breakdown in the league of playing less minutes in the Detroit Pistons is overshadowed by Rodney Stuckey. If you look at his past 13 games, Allen Iverson hasn't been so hot. Also his assist numbers are going way down the toilet.    3. Carmelo Anthony is starting to disappoint his team and his fans lately. He has been injury prone to the MAX. After scoring that 33 points in a quarter he got injured again. But until he comes back healthy, he will dominate.    4. Kevin Garnett goes with the same idea as Allen Iverson. He is playing less minutes which means, less points, less rebounds, less blocks for KG.    5. Marcus Camby is extremely good this season but I would advice you to bench him for the next 4 games because he needs to process through that sore back. But after then, he will be giving you a 20-20.
LVrH8W57aa	OMFG !! WHAT ANA AMZING MATCH THIS WOULD BE!    look at the ressemblence :  1-Both are the  Most bendy Girls in there respective Promotions    2- Both have at least 3 moves as Finishers ( Melina has the extreme leg drop, the extreme makeover, the last call and the california dream ), and mschif has the oblitirator, desecrator and cod green.    3- they have similar moves like the cod green(yoshi tonic) and the california dream (muta lock )    4- i think both have been wrestling for the same ammount of time since 2000    5- both names start with an "m" ( not that it matters thoug lol)    6- and both of them can SCREAM, no need to explain on Mschif , and just remember Melina's manager days.    oh i would love to see that match it would be a finisher spot fest, both of these 2 are in my top 5 fav. female wrestlers ever .    both of them are Great Brawlers, Melina is probably the best brawler in wwe today, watch her trow her punches and she is 1 of the best at submissions.    the winner would be Mschif thoug, Melina doesn't have enough world wide and indy experiance to keep up with her.    BQ : Yes.    starred|`|ku2RpXotaa	There are some Joshi wrestlers that are more bendy, but as far American's are concerned, that would kick *** with bending. I'd say MsChif would get the win with the Desecrator in fifteen minutes of solid, technical action.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	melina would win!|`|JiCfYfLraa	melina would get stomp mschif would break melina. melina is one of my favorite wwe divas but im sorry melina have no wins with mschif,but she would give competition. it would be a good match though they have the same powerbomb move lol.

I'm trying as much as possible to watch wrestling from all over the world, the North American indys and Japan, but I can't really do it because I have school to worry about, plus it's not exactly possible to tape-trade or anything in my country since the only wrestling fans here are mostly WWE fans.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Wrestling Fan    I Watch    WWE   TNA  CMLL  AAA   NJPW  NWE|`|kY6H6Fvaaa	I only watch WWE because I've seen other companies and I just don't like them, cough**especially TNA**cough|`|wdrILdSpaa	I have been a wrestling fan my whole life.

I try to catch WWE, TNA, ROH, AAA, CMLL, Pro Wrestling NOAH, Dragon Gate, New Japan Pro Wrestling, All Japan Pro Wrestling and Independent Wrestling Promotions when I can.
rJMZdp04aa	TNA - Only because they have a Great TV Deal that Makes them Easy to Watch.    If ROH got a National TV Deal (instead of the HDNet) on say like TNT - THAT would Probably be my 2nd Favorite.    NJPW is Great too.    CZW is Good , If I'm in the mood for some Crazy Sh*t Extreme Wrestling.    AJPW , Zero One , DragonGate , AAA , WWA are all good as well.    Then Again , I'm a Pro Wrestling fan in General , Not just a WWE Mark.......|`|gXHxf2G9aa	TNA.

I've seen some ROH and believe that it is the better than TNA but I can't follow regularly like I can with TNA.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	TNA.. It's almost as good as WWE...

FAN OF WRESTLING SINCE THE GOLDEN ERA  to answer the other question you asked YES i am a true wrestling fan.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	ROH. TNA uses too many damn gimmick matches for my liking    CHIKARA comes a close second though|`|QYGGn7lBaa	Cagefighting On VS or UFC|`|zhXFtgPqaa	TNA, it has a great X Division. They put over males and females from all divisions and don't discriminate when it comes to size or anything like that. They have amazing talent and so many gifted competitors in technical wrestling, extreme wrestling, mat wrestling, x-division wrestling, power wrestling, and more.     They have a very physical women's division that get a lot of attention and are treated appropriately. TNA has come a very long way. Sure there are some things they could work on, but they have done a lot of great things already. I love both WWE and TNA.|`|0NNEJXJPaa	My Top three"  PWG - Super Dragon, El Generico, Human Tornado, Cheech  Dragon Gate - CIMA, Yokosuka, Ryo Saito, Masato Yoshino, Dragon Kid  NOAH - KENTA, Naomichi Marufuji, Misawa, Kobashi, Taue,    My Bottom 1:  WWE - because of: John Cena, Batista, Kane, Cody Rhodes,|`|cRqwANvlaa	Dragon Gate and ROH.     Both show what wrestling TRULY is and they both have insanely stacked rosters. And the cool thing about it is the companies face each other traditionally each year at ROH's Supercard of Honor, not to mention the ROH guys travel to Japan a few times a year as well. I especially love DG's faction format where everyone is in their own respective factions and each one has a leader, with a handful of unaffiliated guys.    PWG is another good one. They have an excellent roster and great storylines, but that's not to say the storylines from ROH and Dragon Gate aren't good as well, because they are amazing.|`|05RmoBJ6aa	TNA because it's the most easily accessible promotion outside of WWE and it caters to both casual and "smart" fans.    ROH, SHIMMER, I guess NJPW and Dragon's Gate?|`|F3VjJAdiaa	TNA all the way. And I agree with the Joker
IMu3wBu8aa	I have grown up watching the WWE. I was 3 when I started and I am 21 now. I don't hate TNA, I just find it hard getting through all of those promos. WWE has a lot too, but their acting is much better. Story lines behind them seem to be stronger as well. The wrestling in TNA is awesome. When...WHEN they have matches, I love watching. I used to watch when Jeff was there. It was good. As time went on, the promos began taking over the show. The little jabs at the WWE were thrown in as well. They weren't done properly. They were beyond obvious and were pretty immature. I get turned off by TNA is many ways, but it also sucks me in at times. When Christian was there, I tuned in at times. It was hard to watch him on another promotion, but I managed the best I could. After he left, I tuned in again. Just to see how it's been doing. I couldn't get through the whole episode, two weeks I tried. I enjoyed "The Best of TNA" episode because there were A LOT of matches. On a regular show now, it seems like it's over-run with promos and bad acting. Sometimes I see a little of WCW in TNA, which is obviously not the best thing...being it's not around. Actually, WCW was way better. I wouldn't even compare the two. I just see TNA going downhill if they don't stop with the promos. They need to get back to wrestling, that was what made them different than the WWE. There were more matches, less promos. Now, they have taken the promo route. It's not like them. I don't know, it's just so much different. It's getting a lot of hype and everytime I put it on, I'm disappointed. I've been watching Alex Shelley and turning it off once he was done with his matches. The rest seemed to lose my attention. The matches and wrestling is still good, but they aren't focusing on it anymore. At least, not as much. I keep giving it another chance, and it never seems to win me over like it used to. I don't hate TNA, it just needs a lot of work. I've been watching the WWE all of my life, literally...so that's the kind of style I like. Everything is stronger and more interesting. I guess being a fan of it and the wrestlers for so long would do that. Tna doesn't have that tradition aspect the way the WWE does for me.|`|0P40aUA0aa	i like WWE   it is the best|`|cdd147902e81bc55214600dbc4c6afbfaa	Well, Ive always been a big fan of th WWE but Im a bigger wrsetling fan. TNA was really cool for awhile, but then I just lost interest. I still dvr impact every thursday but just can find the time to sit thru 2 hrs of something I just don't find interesting anymore. The last time i was watched it pety williams was'nt being used as much or if at all...y is that? They have so much young talent over there but they just don't know how to use 'em.|`|xPy6ZePkaa	WWE and TNA are both good brands, but in retrospect WWE is the better brand. I have nothing against TNA, but when you look at TNA they don't have many original wrestlers. A lot of them have come from WWE or WCW. Most of those wrestlers are just washed up and trying to make something of themselves. They don't have as big as a fan base as the WWE either. Sting, I believe, is what makes TNA. Honestly if it wasn't for Sting I would prob not watch TNA.|`|370gjAaRaa	wwe has much better promotions better announcers and it's true, the wwe is just more exciting and more entertaining|`|7IWvFHOxaa	To be honest and to the point, I find it hard to watch non live events. That is why I probably only watch RAW. And the other thing is I can't stand that stupid ring they have in TNA. Call me a traditionalist but I like my rings square and nothing else. Although I do think TNA has some very good skilled wrestlers and innovative moves.|`|6JUC2OMQaa	I love WWE! I tried to watch TNA once and just couldn't...  It's just so lame! The Main Event Mafia were talking about how they were so great for literally ten minutes. It looks the budget for the show is ten bucks and the things that happen are so stupid! The ref throws King Booker out of the ring! SO WHAT? I can't stand to watch. The wrestlers there are so stupid! I HATE IT! Why anyone would ever watch it is beyond my definition of not making sense. It is so stupid.....  glad I got that off my chest!|`|rseD4OG2aa	I'm not a TNA hater by any means, but it does have some serious problems with it that prevent me from liking it on the same level as WWE. First off, and I know this isn't a great reason but I'm just being honest, WWE really has the name value. I've grown up with it, you know what I mean?  I tried watching TNA for about two months right around the time Jeff Jarret returned. I missed watching Kurt Angle, he's always been one of my favorites, so I figured I'd give it a try. The actual wrestling was really good. I was surprised at the high impact bumps guys like Angle, Christian Cage and Samoa Joe took in comparison to the WWE headliners.   The big problem I ran into was the lack of wrestling. As important as good promos are, there are just too many of them. I counted it up and on average over half the program is given to promo time. Some are up to four or five minutes long. After Sting, Angle and maybe Christian, they don't really have many true promo guys like John Cena, Chris Jericho or Triple H who are fantastic on the mic.  TNA's mid card didn't really impress me much. I found Matt Morgan boring and Abyss really a poor man's Kane rip off. Mind you I really did like their X-Division, and that's something that WWE can really learn from. Overall though, to me, TNA doesn't have the same level of strong mid-carders waiting in the wings to take over. A.J. Styles is a superstar, but other than him, they have no Shelton Benjamin's, MVP's, CM Punk's or Mr. Kennedy's.   And TNA's PPV quality is no where near as good as WWE's. The best part of wrestling for me is the PPV's and TNA's just didn't do it for me.|`|nKSmgjylaa	Hey BL. Well, as you probably all know, I love both to death, so I'm just gonna answer as to why more people should give it a chance.    The Heavyweight Division - Sting. Samoa Joe. AJ Styles. Kurt Angle. Booker T. Scott Steiner. And plenty more to boot. Yeah, some used to be in the WWE, but this a whole different thing. Some proper legendary wrestlers, Sting is a WCW Legend, Samoa Joe is a ROH Legend, and AJ Styles is a TNA Legend.     The X Division - "It's not about weight limits, it's about no limits". No limits indeed. The X Division guys are Amazing with a capital A. Steel Asylum match? Enough said. Gotta see these guys to believe them.    The Knockouts Division - About as far from the likes of Kelly and Candice as you can get. Roxxi is proper hardcore, Velvet and Angelina are hillarious, and ODB, what can I say? Haha. It's the knockouts that drew me to TNA, I'm a big lover of proper womens wrestling.    The Tag Team Division - Morgan and Abyss, The MCMGs, Beer Money, Team 3D. All amazing teams, and it's great that TNA really put an emphasis on these guys. They deserve the effort that TNA put on them, and they're doing great work for the company.    All amazing world class athletes. Yeah, WWE is bigger. But who says bigger is always better? WWE = Entertainment. TNA = Amazing wrestling. Both are brilliant companys, and I urge "Anti - TNA" and "WWE forever" type people to at least give TNA a chance. If it's still not your cup of tea, no problem, but try it. You can't say you hate a food without trying it like.     (:|`|it2UVkF4aa	I like the WWE, and I think TNA is obkay.    Added point: That's not true. The WWE has the best pro wrestlers amoungst any other promotions in existence.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	Because TNA has the same thing every single show. The only story line they have is the Main Event Mafia vs. the Front Line. Every single one of their matches revolves around that story line. Every single main event ends with the Main Event Mafia guy winning and the other members coming out a giving a beat down. It's like watching the same show over and over again. The same side always wins. It's stupid. WWE at least has some variety. Plus, TNA steals everything from WWE. Shark boy is using Stone Colds gimmick, Abyss is using Kane's gimmick. The King of the Mountain match is a rip off of the ladder match. They can't eve get by without WWE's wrestlers. It's pathetic really.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	I like the wwe,and tna is pretty good as well.At first I thought tna was just going to be garbage but it turned out to be an okay show.It isn't half bad.Actually I enjoy watching tna to well watch the wrestling,it is pretty far out there.As the wwe's is starting to get kind of boring with this rating change and no blood or anything.For crying out loud it is wrestling it is violence.I think tna is an okay promotion the wrestling matches are very entertaining to watch.But I prefer wwe,because although storylines and ratings have sucked lately I still enjoy it more.I think it is because they have more to offer to the viewers.I'm sorry but wwe really eliminated the main competition and I don't see tna becoming a threat to the wwe like wcw was.Not anytime soon anyway.|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	wait hold the phone  i think tna is 10 times better than wwe especially with the mem and the frontline feud and wwe might be bigger but bigger isnt always better and last petey williams/ brother ray next tna whc

5vXgcAbCaa	I think he is. The way he interrupted Vickie and Edge during their little gag segment. It looked like he was trying to piss them off on purpose. I love his new finisher by the way. That knock out punch is simple, to the point, and best of all, it looks effective as a finisher too. I like him face, heel, or tweener. He's one of the few good big guys in WWE. I couldn't stop laughing when he picked up Vickie.|`|IMJp1HhZaa	A Fat B astard..........XD|`|qZUfwVvTaa	he is still a heel    but I think he will eventually become face|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Still a heel.

2y87h7BOaa	All I can say is Disney is fckin gay and retarded by overrating miley cyrus and the jonas brothers.    Miley was downhill from the start, so they just targeted the little kids who like her based on how she acts on tv, and cuz they're too young and ignorant to realize that its all acting.    Jonas brothers on the other hand were doing just fine until Disney fcked them up.    so if they showed up, it would for sure ruin wrestlemania. UNLESS, they were attacked.|`|O22eHc4jaa	Hmm..dont care.|`|F1oWUJjPaa	God I hate them.

Just because he didn't appear at the Royal Rumble doesn't mean he isn't coming back at all.  I am a pro wrestling insider.  I work for a few websites that cover news about the professional wrestling world. What I can tell you is that Christian HAS SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH THE WWE that I know for sure, so he is coming back to the WWE.  When he will be on TV is anyone's guess.  All I know is that he will be back in time for Wrestlemania. Now everyone was saying that Christian wasn't even at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit for the Rumble. The truth is CHRISTIAN WAS AT THE ROYAL RUMBLE.  However, WWE decided not to use him. As a matter of fact they did not plan on using him at all for the show.  So all of you who say he is not coming back need to keep your opinions to yourself.  I have been covering this story ever scene his TNA contract expired back in December.  Right after his contract was up, he signed with WWE right away.  WWE gave him an offer he couldn't refuse, he's coming back just be patient.|`|Lvmpn4EPaa	I do not think he is|`|XfR9SHepaa	I do!|`|fcgVfjHqaa	no,  his going to mexico|`|cdd147902e81bc55214600dbc4c6afbfaa	It seems like its just a matter of time.|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	He's coming back.  He was supposed to be coming back at RR but contract stipulations meant he couldn't appear so RVD was brought in for one night only.|`|AA11832245	I`m not sure I have been hearing that he is coming back, but I would`nt hold my breath.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	he has signed a contract with the wwe. he WILL come back. i think they are just waiting to bring him in at the right time..|`|4B9JWYPLaa	he aint cming bck.       http://domesticutilities.com  http://obamavsosama.co.uk    But who knows
NQkRzBtJaa	Stone Cold vs The Rock already happened  John Cena vs Batista already happened  Batista vs The Undertaker already happened  Stone Cold vs Mr McMahon already happened  Undertaker vs Stone Cold already happened  Undertaker vs The Rock already happened    The two matches that leave are The Great Khali vs Mark Henry and Stone Cold and The Rock vs DX. My favourite of these to see would be DX vs Stone Cold and The Rock that would be an amazing match to see I always wanted Stone Cold and The Rock to be a tag team and it would be awesome to see them go against Shawn Michaels and Triple H. All four of these guys were huge superstars during the attitude era and it would be awesome to see. The other match I would pick to see is Stone Cold vs The Rock even though it has happened before I would love to see it again.|`|nKSmgjylaa	I'd hate Khali vs. Henry.  SCSA vs. Rock happened.

Mickie James, I can't do a split.  6. Melina, she stayed with Mercury and Nitro for over a year. You really have to want it to hang out with two gay f*gs for that long.  7. Mickie James, she has won the title more times than Melina.  8. Mickie James, she's been more involved with the greats like Stratus and Lita. Melina is good, but you don't get into the hall of fame by spending a year with two gays.  9. Mickie James, do you know how many red carpet girls there are out there?  10. Can I take both?

sqfjfR3iaa	It would appear to me that the only thing Randy Savage and World Wrestling Entertainment have agreed on is the fact that they will make a lot of money selling DVD Sets of some of his best matches. If the WWE were to induct him into the WWE Hall of Fame this year, then I would believe that Vince McMahon, Stephanie McMahon, Triple H and Randy Savage have agreed to put past disagreements, incidents and bitterness behind them.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	no, He and Vince are still butting heads|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	I think this is the first step in a reconciliation.   He won't be inducted this year as it would overshadow Austin who is supposed to be the star inductee like Flair last year and MR Perfect before him.  Also, rumor is Ricky Steamboat is being inducted this year and WWE don't normally induct 2 people from the same era in the same ceremony.

aYnduRsxaa	Because there's no competition. The attitude era only existed so he could compete with WCW. But now that there's no competition, he doesn't feel the need to try so hard.
H3nbC71eaa	All of them, I see Tyler Black being the future of the company..if they get past the whole MEM thing. Roderick Strong can have a solid career there, probably add something again to the slowing X-division. Sara Del Rey would be the top Knockout there with Awesome Kong. Sara would give a great challenge to Kong also since she is also an animal in the ring..with a lot of pure talent.
sqfjfR3iaa	No, they are on different brands and there is no connections between their storylines.|`|AA11482019	Feud over what?  They are on two different brands and HBK is busy with this JBL stuff.  There's no enough time is properly build a feud between Michaels and the Undertaker in time for WrestleMania.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	ya, b/c of what Taker said at the Rumble|`|xPy6ZePkaa	No they wont. They feuded awhile back. I don't see them getting into it again yet.|`|2y87h7BOaa	That would make a really good storyline, but (unfortunately), I think it's too late now. A rivalry between HBK and Undertaker is too good to be only about 1-2 months long.    But if they ever do face at Wrestlemania, it will be an extremely entertaining match.  A few months ago, there was a match on Smackdown; Undertaker vs Triple H. I found that match extremely exciting especially cuz of Undertaker's performance.  A few weeks before the Royal Rumble, there was another match; Shawn Michaels vs John Cena. That match was really, really exciting because of HBK's performance.    So a match between those to superstars would be truly phenomenal.|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	No, its too late now.  A good feud needs at least 2 months which they don't have as HBK is still tied up in the JBL feud.
sqfjfR3iaa	Check with your Cable or Satellite Provider to see if they are still runnin the Replay of the 2009 Royal Rumble Pay Per View. Otherwise, your just going to have to buy it from WWE Shop when WWE releases it.|`|7ACBEowxaa	watchtvsitcoms.net    watch-movies.net

NQkRzBtJaa	If MVP does get the US title I agree with you that he won't hold it for that long a few months at top. I believe that the WWE is planning on making MVP a main event superstar and I think it will start by him winning the Money in the Bank ladder match at Wrestle Mania. If he does win the US title it will just to show that he is over his losing streak and is on a new winning streak.|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	No, he isn't gonna win it again cos he's at that next level between main event and midcard.|`|8OmOKEOUaa	no way he won 2 times in what 2 months|`|8Try9VSqaa	i think he will win it, i think he will get offered wwe champion shot at no way out in the elimination chamber instead.|`|3oUSroiZaa	WORLDS BIGGEST HARDY FAN IS A GEEK JUST LIKE THE REST OF THIS SECTION!|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I dont think he will win it, I think he will go right after the WWE title|`|97jqpA54aa	what makes u think he will win it|`|dZfrr4rPaa	I think he's gonna win the MITB at wrestlemania! So he may not get the U.S title back at all but If he does it will be a short reign!    Edit: To the two people above me, There gonna do big things with MVP, they had him on a 23 loss streak to punish him for some s**t he did and to knock him down a couple notches! but the fact is he took it like a champ and will be given a big title shot this year ...just wait and see!

rjuqrHK7aa	I haven't got to watch minnesota play very often but I am a Kentucky fan. I do know that Tubby Smith teams play good defense. I think they should be ranked in the 20 to 25 range. They will get to the tournament. You have a good coach. He was just here to long and we needed a change.
nzKo4TFvaa	yes he is good wrestler|`|j9GokH9Qaa	I like him.. he is one the few people that still are in the WWE from the Attitude Era.. he is past his prime so that's why he isn't as good as before anymore.. recently he has gotten worse with his new finisher move.. the knock out punch is just sily... they should've stayed with chokeslam as his finisher...but oh well.. I think he is still pretty good in the ring.. but not as good as The Undertaker and Kane..|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I have never liked the Big Slow|`|l3AZzVfMaa	Ah, not too keen about Big Show. To me, he has always been that guy who was only hired because of his size yet have no wrestling ability and seemed kind of boring.    I liked him better during his WCW days as The Giant.

Since they are kids.. they like the "good guys" so I doubt any teenagers and adults really care..|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I Am, I even Changed my name to prove i like Matt better    I cheered for Shawn after he hit Marty, I will cheer for Matt now that he hit Jeff.|`|pO0rfIv0aa	yes i am and forever will be a matt hardy fan|`|CzTXKJoNaa	People that don't like Matt now after the RR are marks.|`|H7p09fL2aa	i actually like matt hardy more  since he does basic wrestling moves and that's my favorite style (the basic)  so him betraying jeff hardy is a good storyline|`|97jqpA54aa	I still like him but people who are Jeff Hardy fans don't  its simple the people who liked Matt in the 1st place won't care|`|O22eHc4jaa	I will always be a Matt Hardy Fan!!

XrCc85kNaa	wow...thanks for telling me that Lee is white...  I thought he was from India....    NO....he has played well but he doesn't deserve to be in the all-star game....  I believe Lebron, KG, CB3 have played much better than him....  Besides...if Lee was in....who should go out?|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Based on the premise of teams not doing good CB4 should not be an All-star for that sole reason even though his stats are through the roof. I am a Knicks fan and can honestly say w/o Lee we would be 15 games lower.     Not only does Lee lead the NBA in double doubles, but he has won all the match ups btwn. players, like Shaq, Amare, Brand, West,Jamison,KG, Yao, and Duncan the best PF in NBA history said, that Lee will be a multiple All-star one day, so I take it Lee feels reassured and will not take the snub to heart. He is also 4th in FG% and RPG. He was in these categories top 5 for 3 years now and this year is his first to do so in the starting lineup and not the bench.    Jameer Nelson aka Playoff choker should not be an All-star. I knew 3 years ago the Magic would be a beast in the East by seeing DH12 turn into a dominating force. Knowing, very well the Center position is a new breed of finesse players the Magic would pose an advantage on a nightly basis on that sole premise. Especially, if they surround Howard w/ shooters cause his presence opens the court more. Jameer is not a All-star. Neither, is Devin Harris he is a stat pading player, but not a leader.    VC is the leader and All-star of that team. Harris gets stats and does not lead. J Kidd on the Mavs may not get more stats than Harris, but they are @ better odd to succeed than they were with Harris. Look, at it this way w/ a healthy Carter Kidd would have done better than a 20-28 record. Especially, with FA's like Keyon Dooling signing. In fact, Kidd last year as bad as the Nets were had a better record at this point of the season than they do now.    Lee deserved it over all these guys.|`|I2I843Myaa	No, he isn't on the allstar team because he isn't good enough, that's that.|`|GBGcI509aa	So..    His team isnt doing good.|`|98wFqBwSaa	No one cares about your best american white.  GTFO little boy!|`|21XmVm6Zaa	he should definetly be in the all star game...im not gonna lie i wasnt a fan at first but white boy does have game ...hes a good defender and can get you points...over the years he's become a more consistent player... i think he is overlooked because he plays for the knicks which lets face it suck at this time|`|I3jXJEyAaa	No I don't think he should be on the Eastern All Star team, he is on the knicks, nobody from that team needs to be an all-star|`|6b0d12f21558829beec7ac811cd8d438aa	no  his team isnt that great  he's not the leader, as theres also hmmm chris duhon and al harrington|`|4l15fB7qaa	As a Knick fan, I am a little perturbed at David Lee being snubbed as he could easily replace:    Jameer Nelson - 17 points per game & 5.4 Asts per game (09')    and    Rashard Lewis - 19.3 points per game & 6.0 rebounds per game (09').    Lee is having a fantastic year at 15.7 ppg and 11.6 ppg (clearly better than jameer nelson IMO)    Still on the West Coast, Al Jefferson was an even bigger snub at 22.9 ppg and 10.6 rpg    Although some may say that when Lee's outside jumper is more of a surprise, he doesn't deserve the spot. Even if his team is under .500 and when his team's offense is more conducive to bigger stat lines, it was not fair at all for David Lee to be excluded from Pheonix.     Lee and the Knicks are in contention for the eighth seed as of today 1/31/09 because they are only half a game behind its current owners, the Bucks.    If the Knicks win today, the will be 21-25 and if the Bucks lose, the Knicks would take the eighth seed.    The bottom line is Lee deserved to play in the All Star Game, but he was just left out.

lsXcvlTbaa	Dear god billy you are genuinely scraping the barrel and heading towards your tedious bitterness of previous. I never read all your post as I was bored to tears by the first paragraph. Tatty is spot on as usual. I assume you rate Fletcher and this is why you are so upset, I dont rate him but I hope we sign him if that's the case.|`|nH4TOhGVaa	hmmm sounds as if you have given up the chance of winning the league this season and pinning your hopes of winning it next season as celtic will have a weaker team than now|`|lKdLsRPDaa	God, you talk some shite.     Your opinions, are just biased drivel, basically, you rate everyone that plays for Rangers and think everyone that plays for Celtic is shite or overrated. You really are too biased to have an objective discussion with.     You seem to judge a players ability, by the team they play for and not their actually ability, skill and what they achieve. You constantly, talk about Celtic players negatively, highlighting (what you see as weaknesses or whats wrong with them), while talk about all Rangers players so positively, highlighting (what you see as strengths or whats good about them).     You really just expose a general dislike for all things Celtic, rather than any logical, objective or well reasoned, thoughts or analysis.      Your views on anything Celtic, unfortunately, do not merit any form of discussion, let alone an objective one.     How can I, when you view a players ability, by the club he plays for.     I often praise Kris Boyd , rate Kevin Thomson and I often criticise Celtic players, I'm honest and objective enough, to rate a player on his actual ability, not the club he plays for.|`|hrfncdZDaa	i'm sure he does, otherwise he would have already have been daft enough to sign for THEM!!!|`|8kpvTUQaaa	I think Hibs have done themselves and Fletcher a huge favour.|`|BdiQPKn0aa	I truly hope that for the sake of his career he stays where he is|`|S0LSmJ9haa	Fletcher has his own mind and has asked Hibs not to price him out of a move...

cRqwANvlaa	I used to love the PCS series and the final match for the trophy with Starr vs Shelley was pretty good. It's a good method of comic relief and it was not boring like most of the TNA promos are these days. But Nash would not be able to do it since he is in the Main Event Mafia. Starr is in TNA as Austin Aries, Shelley is in the MCMG with Sabin, so I have no clue who would actually host it. Maybe Borash, but he tends to get annoying. I would have Sonjay Dutt, Eric Young, Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, and Shane Sewell to participate in it and have the final match be between Jay and Sonjay. That would be sweet.|`|hT32vMkPaa	nah
WdOAxQmoaa	yes,Arsenal have been incosistant,and no mature players(wenger has been saying that for past 4 years and done fcuk all about it)    always in transition,i'v had ebough of it,i aint the only one who think he showed go.      youth,and crap players simple as that. shows of donkeys the lot of them.    nasri out left? he's watsed there,CM is his fav,so why does wenger not play him there. get that french outa there.|`|Yb0182Vxaa	Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, Villareal, Ateti, Valencia, Sevilla, Milan, Juventus...etc may you are right    FQ- I go for Barcelona, enough said. not winning games in a row|`|HkqiGEMuaa	Nope. I haven't..|`|KRKRuhliaa	good observing but...don't remain focused on a body part, rather, look past it, to see the beauty of the person and teammates. Now, go in peace friend. God bless =-)|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Yes you're right. Some, luckily, dropped points early on (ManU and Barca) and that hasn't changed their title hopes.    Some others drop them recently like Liverpool and CHelsea and that has put them in tough positions whilst teams like Milan, Arsenal and Juve unexpectedly drop them randomly...    And the worse is dropping points when the rivals ahead of you do, thus not capitalizing on the chance.    Milan's inconsistency is that they have ended up drawing about 6 games they were winning, letting the other teams score in the second half or even really late. It happened with Lecce at the 93rd min, with Roma, with Genoa on Wed at the 87th, with Chievo also at the end of the second half, etc|`|3yqCKPzVaa	@Marco: We won that game against Chievo 1-0 thanks to Kaka's penalty.... we didnt draw that match...    However you're forgetting that game against Torino as well... when Kaladze conceded that penalty (due to a handball in the box) in the latter part of the game after Ronaldinho had given Milan the lead with a freekick goal... The game ended 2-2...    Answer to Question:    Barca simply couldnt be more consistent.. as they appear in amazing form.. the only team in all 3 competitions...    12 pts at the Summit of La Liga...  In Copa SemiFinals....  In UCL Round of 16...      Same couldnt be said for Milan tho cause of what Marco said..|`|M0gdrhB2aa	yeh..im noticing way too much of it...i don't want it to be this way..but its all the more challenging..    Aresnal has not been consistent, i say its because of the injuries ..but it could be more than that
kbIHYS5xaa	David Silva!!!|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	Villa is one of the top 5 best strikers in the world.

Villa is my fav Spanish player with Senna|`|fEWhwumZaa	David Villa|`|oNR7il8baa	Well Villa is a Striker while Silva is a Midfield... So it's hard to judge.     They both do their job, and they do it great.    I like both =]|`|9cec8ae4ba54123737529f03b27d06e2aa	Both r really good but David Villa is better|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Well they both play different positions so it's hard to choose.  Villa to me is one of the best strikers ever. Silva is an amazing mid-fielder he can play  RW,LW, CM, AM. Hard to choose because they both are important. Silva passes up and Villa scores. Tight comparison...I honestly cannot choose.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	David Villa...|`|JiKNOtvdaa	David Villa is way better than David Silva|`|1NwjxaVZaa	david villa  simply one of the best strikers|`|vbN50Na3aa	Not 100% comparable      ... but David Villa ;)
hl9nqKQ2aa	Im sure all Valencia fans will say he should stay there.  But with all respect he is too good to be happy with just playing champions league football,  I do not know the politics of the situation but at Barc/Madrid He would flourish and win the trophies a truly great player like him deserves|`|oNR7il8baa	I think David Villa is an exceptional player. I'd like him to stay at Valencia. He's doing great there.|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	as a football fan who hates players who are overrated and are rated only for where they play, i'd say Valencia's the place for him, he has hit top form with Valencia and even did better than any striker of Real Madrid, Barcelona or others in 2008, him transferring to a bigger team would be the only way people would talk about him more, and i wouldn't want people to say he's the best only because he plays for Barcelona or Manchester or some other club.|`|p1kmZziVaa	Nah, he belongs in Valencia.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	First off I love Valencia and Villa. I think he is an amazing striker. One of the best in my opinion. He doesn't have to be at a "big" club to be known so well. That's what I love about him unlike Ronaldo who is a big football star now because he plays for Man Utd and Messi because he plays for Barcelona. I'm not criticizing any of those players I'm just saying that Villa doesn't have to be at a rich and famous club to be known well. I think Valencia is a great place for Villa and he should stay there.|`|RrGtax7xaa	I think he's an excellent player but at Valencia he doesn't get noticed by many people, if he was at a bigger club maybe people would recognise him more and he'd get more praise from everyone, he's very good and plays very well for country and club. :]
qyATAaeXaa	Elk Mountain is the best in Northeast PA. It is away from the main Pocono resorts and is usually less crowded. The terrain variety is also very good. $53 on weekends/$45 on weekdays. http://www.elkskier.com/    Ski Plattekill in the Catskills. Also out of the way. Lots of expert terrain too. $50 weekends/$30 weekdays.  http://www.plattekill.com/winter/index.p...    I also like Gore Mountain. It can be a bit crowded on Saturdays, but Sundays are usually not super busy except on Holiday weekends.

KDOIKIq2aa	A wildlife biologist is a scientist that specializes in studying wild animals.  Many work for governments, everything from city, State to Federal.  The luck ones find a private firm or organization to work for where the real money is at.    They go to college for four to six years and get at least a Bachelor's degree or Master's degree.  Many of their summers during school are taken up working intern or part time jobs with State Department of Natural Resources or lucky ones get a Federal slot.  This is all to build a resume so you can find and get a paying job after college.

UQLNP6iyaa	Approaching this from the position of as unbiased an opinion as I have ever had on the eve of a Superbowl (I don't hate either team, I have a respect for the Rooney's and the Steelers organization balanced by a life-long lean toward the Cinderella/underdog) I find your reasoning compelling.     To be honest, I genuinely didn't think the Seahawks played well enough to win SB XL, although I agree that there was some deeply questionable officiating. I don't think though that I would say the Steelers didn't deserve to win. That game is probably the second closest I've come to feeling true neutrality going into it.    For tomorrow, I do see this being a battle of powerful offense vs. stout defense. I was thinking about the BCS NC game and tried to draw comparison to that, but the fact is that the Steelers offense is, comparatively, nowhere near as competent and potent as Florida's and the Card's D has already reached beyond themselves in the post season and must go into tomorrow feeling a lot more comfortable about lining up against Big Ben & Co than the Sooners did against the Gators.    As such, I think you're right, I do think the Steelers will have to wait to complete their half-dozen, but I won't necessarily put it all down to Superbowl Karma.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	History books don't win -- or lose -- championships. What has happened for or against the Steelers in the past has nothing to do with who is going to win tomorrow. Try again when you have a legit reason for the Cardinals to win. There are some good arguments for the Cardinals, but this is NOT one of them.    Thank you, I can respect real football reasoing. I think if the Cardinals are able to get a good lead (key word being if) they will win. Not because the Steelers offense can't come from behind (because they definitely can) but because of the way they can keep their heads and stay in game-control/clock-control mode once they have the lead. I would have to say that Larry will probably break a big one at some point during the game. What will be interesting to see is how Warner responds to the pass rush. I hate to call it a blitz because they usually only send 4 guys, but that's the way you have to respond to it. He's done well so far this postseason, I think his response, as well as Ben's decision making, will decide the game.|`|OluSJC1caa	Dude, I am an Eagles fan in Philly. I hate Cardinals, and support my brothers down the road in Pittsburgh. Go Steelers, bring the championship to PA.

NO ONE knows who is going to win tomorrow. The game didn't even happen yet dang.|`|U3ZR4aMcaa	The only time I remember the Steelers coming from behind was when Tony Romo handed them the game. It was in Pittsburgh as well. The Steelers have a bad *** front 8, and okay to weak secondary. They don't go up and fight for the ball. When your defense has such heavy pressure it's easy to sit back and tee off. If they don't get that pressure, they will get schooled. Watch the old New England Pats vs Steelers games. Brady would buy a little time and then tee off on the secondary. Players will be high strung due to the emotion. The Steelers could tire out easy.    I realize they are the better team, but K Wiz used to coach in Pitts. He's no fool.

The main reason I like TNA better then WWE now.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	yes first i watch in 1999 then in 2002 then in 2005 when  Muhammed  Hassan was there now present|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I stopped from 2002ish - 2005|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	yeah i stoped for a year and then started to watch tna|`|JiCfYfLraa	yea in the 2002 around the time victoria came in and feud with trish. then i started back watching it,i really dont know why i stopped and in the 2004 around the time lita was womans champion when she beat trish and lost it a NYR 2005 i stopped watching it then got back on it when trish made her return from back injury. i mostly watch wrestling because i wanna keep up with the diva matches lol. i like the guys wrestling too but mostly favor the divas.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	I started watching it at 1996 and stoped watching it in 2007.. 1997-2002 were the glory days for WWE.. 2003-2006 was entertaining enough to keep me watching.. I actually liked it.. 2007.. was a horrible year.. At the early 2007 when John Cena became WWE champion... It got boring for me and I stoped watching it.. I got back watching it during the summer of 2008.. In the middle of Kane and the bag storyline.. I started liking it because I thought he would go back to Masked Kane.. and... I was wrong.. turns out some gay storyline for Rey Mysterios return.. But then I heard about Christian returning and I started watching it again.. and It actually improved since 2007..|`|F1oWUJjPaa	The first time was from 1995-1999 then 2002-2005|`|l3AZzVfMaa	Yep, 2004 (when I stopped) til middle of last year (then joined the band wagon again.)|`|H7p09fL2aa	i stopped watching it when eddie guerrero lost the wwe title to JBl  then started again untill 2006|`|fKfd4Tp1aa	I stopped watching it from about 2005, until I got back into in late 2007 by playing Smackdown vs Raw 2008. I took me a while to catch up on all of the new superstars, divas and storylines I missed.|`|trvqktw3aa	I did from 03-05 and from talking to ppl and going back and wtching i didnt miss much just Lesnar and Angle doing well|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	Yeah i stopped watching the day after WM 19 and then i got back into it around RR 07.  I gre out of it for while and found other interests which i still have, but i flicked the TV on and started watching again.|`|VQ7t2jOmaa	i stopped watching wrestling in 2005, but then when i heard sting came in TNA, i had to go back....    jus for da stinger....
BIyJUmM9aa	Never been  I WANT TO GO!!    And if I ever do go, I wouldn't care who the Hawks play.  I just want to go see a Hawks game    =]]|`|DmuGQuwuaa	Alot, Here are the games i've been to.    06-07 Season: Magic VS Pacers/ Playoffs: Magic VS Pistons Game 4  07-08: Like 10-15  08-09: like 10.          Hope i Helped Peace!|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I have never been to a NBA game but i would love to see one.|`|6chLhNJhaa	Fu 4 you for not liking the wizards..lol...... Yes i have been to 19 wiz games so far this season|`|LdIgg7yTaa	I live in BC, Canada, which is somewhat near Seattle, so I once went to a Sonics game where they were playing y team (the Suns). Of course, it would have been cooler to watch a game versus a stronger team, but Seattle was the best I could get, and I enjoyed every moment of it.    PS- Once I can afford it, I'm going to Arizona to watch a Suns home game against either the Lakers, the Hornets, the Spurs or the Cavs. (Lakers or Spurs because of the Suns/ Lakers & Suns/ Spurs rivalries, Hornets because I love CP3, and Cavs because I love LeBron.) Hopefully stupid Steve Kerr won't have completely destroyed my team by then, though.|`|4g5Hu1U7aa	I've been to NBA games, but i was dead for every one of them|`|UMVWQiYJaa	ya ive been to quite a few    last game was phoenix vs. mavs|`|YLarhhLJaa	dude i lie in Virginia too and we only gt wizards and they suck this year.    Last year i 3 games and we won 2. When arenas comes back, you should watch against the Phoenix or Huston rockets. Trust it will be unforgettable.|`|2QuGuphYaa	I have been to dozens of NBA games.  They are always a lot of fun, I have had the chance to see some of the great stars past and present such as Shaq, Yao Ming, Patrick Ewing, Lebron, Carmelo, Tim Duncan, Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, etc....    Tons of guys, it's amazing to see them play up close and when you are there you really get a feel for how FAST the game is moving.  I have yet to see Chris Paul which would be great.    PS VA is not too far from Washington D.C. where the wizards play.  I hope you go someday, it's a great experience.|`|dDhTMacAaa	I;'ve been to many in various cities.    Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, Golden State, Miami    but it was part of like a "mission trip" for some of those.|`|vuh0i3Axaa	aha.... i went to the Raptors game yesterday, but had the worst seats... it was cool, especially the whole Jermaine O' Neal ejection|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	Yes, a couple of times. It was the Cavaliers but it's been awhile & I can't honestly remember who they played. Like any other sport, to really appreciate it, you have to see it in person to really appreciate it. There's so much that goes on the you'll never see no matter how big of a screen your TV has. Another thing is you really get to see just how tall those players really are. NBA games are great to go see. Can't afford the tickets now. If you get a chance to go to a game, don't pass it up.|`|Ng9hWG7laa	yes i have been to 4 games. All of them Raptors because i live in Toronto.   1) Tor vs Knicks - pretty cool for first experience the crowd was wild but i think we lost the game by 4  2) Tor vs Mia - it was a great game and got to see one of my fav (wade) play.  3) Tor vs Cleveland - anyone would love to see Lebron play  4) Tor vs Mia (again) - best game ever becasue i got to meet Jose Calderon and Jamario Moon and get pictures with them.    I would really condier u to go to a game, because if u are a big NBA fan then its the best experince of your life. I mean i love basketball and the NBA and going to games is awsome.|`|lct6XftFaa	when i lived in detroit i would always watch the piston games. my fave game was when the fight broke out and the pistons and pacers went at it.    now living in san diego i try to make my way up to l.a. to watch the lakers smash teams.    the experience is great if you have good seats.  if you don't have good seats the vibe is cool to. all of the fans cheer and going wild is awesome.    david stern will never be fired. he'll retire before that happens. he good at what he does.|`|x7LPFDPRaa	no have you|`|ZK3x8pbBaa	Yes.  A Detroit Pistons game.  When they played the Spurs.|`|7PyguvVgaa	Yeah, I saw the bulls play the grizzlies once. the game was great even though our seats were so bad.  this was back when the grizzlies were a playoff team.  i still love the grizzlies though.  you should go to a game sometime.  it is still enjoyable if you are in the back|`|VIolhpS1aa	Yeah i went to a Celtics game in 06'. They versed the Clippers on Feb. 2nd. They lost but i forgot by how much but it wasn't a blowout|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Yeah, I have been to a lot of Celtics games in my day. (A couple hundred) My favorite was in 2005-2006 when the Celtics were fighting for the 8th seed, and beat the Pistons, who were tops in the east, in double overtime.|`|uRGjwIvuaa	Yeah I go to a few Pistons games per year. It's a real nice experience. The last one I went to was Blazers vs Pistons in december.
J8Vb0aYLaa	Both would hurt equally.|`|sCHUFUXsaa	A!!    did u see the bobcats game..  lakers are like nothing. if kobe is not in the game|`|YeNp4m8haa	Kobe gets injured sayonara lakers for 2008-09|`|aVmXxQNtaa	Wow, the dude that said magic johnson suxs is really a piece of ****. He needs to get a life.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	A of course    they will have no leader!    but B is bad news too!|`|n6514FLVaa	if either of those happen! Lakers are a team no player is less important then the other!|`|ed1UHr6Waa	B|`|a9104f111071f35b413edc29b7062fd4aa	That's tough to answer if u think about it. Option A, Lakers wouldn't have a leader and sometimes in tough/close games they need Kobe to bail 'em out of a loss. Option B, they would most likely have more losses 'cause sometimes having both of them against some teams are an advantage and how would the rotation be w/o them?plus, Pau is the most consistent Laker in this season so far, and Andrew's defense and offense seems greater than last year b4 the injury. Both options would hurt the LAL, but I would go toward Option B.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	B|`|uxregJ0faa	We need healthy team to take it all    A. Kobe getting injured would break the Lakers.|`|sOae9LUzaa	The latter, since that cost them Finals last year. Maybe they'll play better team basketball without Kobe hogging the ball.|`|3teWTOPqaa	If Kobe is out for the season the Lakers are done.    W/o Bynum and Gasol, at least we still have Mihm and Kobe took a much lesser team to the playoff before, but w/o Kobe the Lakers offense is pretty much screwed.|`|GBGcI509aa	C|`|BfwzbKSoaa	A     Lakers will be scrambling all over the place for defense and offense
XNbKc7Rzaa	They're all told what to say. Sometimes Vince himself is screaming down the headset telling them every word to say so their 'opinions' may not even be there real opinons.  That why Mick Foley went to TNA, he was sick of being told every single thing to say.  I guess Lawler is the biggest butt kisser though as he always bigs vince up.|`|NUehpH4yaa	Tazz and Cole never talk about Vince, how can they be kiss ups? If anything it's J.R and King one of those. not like this answer matters at all|`|cU7NNfhSaa	Tazz|`|l3AZzVfMaa	Jerry Lawler, hands down... but he does it in a funny way.|`|DI59WzFPaa	Michael Cole.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	It's mainly the heel announcers that love Vince McMahon the most.    But they're told what to say a majority of the time. Most of them could hate Vince McMahon for all we know. Not many people in real life like their boss.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	KING BOKAAAA OR THE WRESTLING GOD JBL|`|3z5gicSLaa	Jerry "stupid"lawler
9Kt7p7Vfaa	You are probably over-thinking the rotation and forgetting to pop at the lip. Your spin can be significantly slower off a 45ft booter so work on popping and spinning at the same time. If you just ride off the lip, you'll be leaning back through your entire spin and its difficult to compensate at the last second. Try keeping your hands out if front of you a bit before you start to spin, that could help you too, and don't forget to pop at the lip. The only time you want to ride right off the lip is when you are carving a three but that's the next lesson.|`|PDiK2IpVaa	practice...I tore my acl trying to three  not saying you should go out and kill youself, but rather work ur way up to larger jumps and it should come naturally

EHthK1Vnaa	Possibly. I mean he's come back and had some pretty good games, shutting down Duncan and whatnot. But on the flip side, he also has been injured and we don't know if it's a fluke. Plus, it wasn't the fact that the Lakers didn't have enough points or boards, they were playing the Celtics who had KG, Paul Pierce, and Ray Ray. 3 guys you gotta cover. Tim Duncan isn't much different from KG, both big guys. But KG i think has a better shot, and to play really good D in a 7 game series on KG is rough. If Kobe keeps on doing what he does, and bench people like Sasha Vujacic step up, I think Andrew Bynum could definitely help out the Lakers.|`|P93I8CHtaa	yes he is|`|GBGcI509aa	Obviously.      Hes there big man|`|AA10495394	yes because he keeps on getting better|`|onvpwieHaa	Of course.     His defense and rebounding are the keys to the Lakers success.     His scoring is just the bonus.|`|nqdDe3cJaa	you need to ask this question ??????? of course he is a key.|`|lbQYYHMbaa	of Course|`|6b0d12f21558829beec7ac811cd8d438aa	yeah  hes a big man and made lamar move to the bench|`|xfFVRK0kaa	andrew bynum really helps with the lakers' toughness and rebounding, he blocks a lot of shots and alters many more, he continues to get better and is a actually getting better numbers than he was this time last year    as to your question, of course, every championship team needs a solid big man, bynum is that big guy for the lakers
UNl2Jk6eaa	I'll second the ABC's of reloading and the Hornady Manual:    http://www.amazon.com/Abcs-Reloading-Def...    http://www.amazon.com/Hornady-Reloading-...|`|WKrQCrUiaa	I will agree on both Lee's book and Hornady but would like to add that Speer has a very good manual and I have found www.Hodgdon.com to be one of my best resources.|`|WBGnXsr7aa	Speer is very easy to understand, and breaks it down without overcomplicating things|`|AA10182211	Simple answer: Don't depend on a book alone.  PERIOD.     Take a NRA metallic reloading course from a local NRA instructor.  Contact the NRA to find one.  There are about 40k instructors around the country.      Then find a mentor and learn the advanced stuff from him.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Many say the ABC's of reloading.  I however haven't read that book.  It might be the best for a beginner. If you can get over his self promotion of his product, I like Richard Lee's book Modern Reloading.  Not the best, but has a lot of information.  Hornady's Handbook of Cartridge reloading 6th Edition (with 2 books) is great, the single book 7th Edition I haven't read so can't comment.
3z5gicSLaa	thats good because nobody should copy old superstars old superstars represent old wwe and new superstars new wwe|`|nzKo4TFvaa	agree becuase RKO is awesome|`|7f2GSDmqaa	You said it just the way I would. I agree with you|`|3I6YUfg0aa	I disagree    Randy Orton is the only decent thing WWE has at the moment.|`|H3nbC71eaa	Agree.    He doesn't have the charisma of Stonecold..and their characters are different. I don't see the comparison at all. Stonecold would've handled his own problems, and that character would never have been part of a stable.  Orton gets a lot of help from his Legacy members..isn't as great on the mic, though he has added a lot more emotion to them..and has gotten better.  Orton is more of a sneaky type of heel, while Stonecold was very in your face about wanting to kick somebody's @ss.|`|09YK9Zboaa	Agreed however Ortons mic-skills are hands down the best in the WWE and if not the best he is a very close second to HHH, he is extremely charismatic and the way he carries himself is perfect.  They could not have picked a better person to mentor Ted Dibiase and Cody Rhodes... AND THERE WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER BE ANOTHER ROCK, there will never be another Jerry Rice, Babe Ruth, or another ROCK|`|0P40aUA0aa	I Disagree|`|xfzjr4uFaa	i agree 100%!!!!|`|az5NtgN6aa	AGREE|`|F1oWUJjPaa	Disagree    Orton is getting better...he's no SCSA yet but he's not far behind|`|H09OAJxSaa	i agree|`|l3AZzVfMaa	Randy and Austin are two completely different people. Even though Randy is feuding with the McMahons its not like the way how Austin had his feud.     Austin Vs McMahons: Austin was the face. Austin represented that worker that always was at odds with his corrupt boss. Even though he would do the most outrageous things to his boss, his boss could never fire him because he is bringing in the cash and the boss gets some sort of enjoyment out of him. Austin doesnt care that he gets fired but knows he cant because he is just that valuable.    Orton Vs McMahons: Orton is a heel. Orton is the cocky know it all who uses his family's legacy for his own advantage. He speaks out of line and sometimes allow his cockiness get the best of him. That cockiness was used against his boss but now is back firing him. The boss lets him know that he doesnt need Orton and that Orton is replaceable and Orton knows it, thats why he does everything possible to stay in the business.|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	i agree and disagree with you simply because, yes obviously there will never be another stone cold or another rock, but that was at their time when wwe was at its best. whose to say that if Randy orton was there at that time he wouldnt be one of the greats right now? Orton is still young, hes has a great career ahead of him and he is still young. he is The top Heel on Raw right now and still has many World Title reigns ahead of him    In my opinion Edge and Orton are the Future of WWE just as The Rock and Austin were its Past|`|TAPBWPJLaa	They compare the two because they see Orton as the Anti-Hero for whatever reason.    Stone Cold Steve Austin was *arguably* the most popular anti-hero ever created, but I don't think of Orton as that at all. I see Orton as a heel just like every other heel: using people to get what he wants and doing everything by any means necessary.
LGVrhTFTaa	I'd try some 2 for 1 trades to open a roster spot for Deng..  Like Rondo+Foye for Carmelo Anthony,,or Joe Johnson (Whoever you want,,and you can send your proposals to several teams simultaniously to speed up the process.)   Rondo should have good trade value,and packaging him should get results.    ~g0()d LuCK!~|`|JQXCdGHYaa	Don't drop him|`|AA10502115	No, don't drop Rondo, he will make excellent trade bait. If you don't like Rondo, many people will take him because since you have the best point guards in the league I suppose that other people lack depth in that position. You can show Rondo's stats to others and with that nice sum of assists you're getting, you can trade for somebody that's actually better than Deng.|`|ipznrSQyaa	NEVER
y2CzXNTLaa	Yeah these are good shoes and by the way the spikes come with the shoes and you just screw them in, it is very simple.|`|g8bjrbEbaa	great shoes but it doesn't matter what shoes it matters who's in the shoes, in your case your screwed, lol|`|WrDGhduxaa	They are good shoes, and when you buy them the spikes are inside the box with a spike wrench.|`|x1rcQdLIaa	yes they are good shoes and if they dont come with more and a wrench you can go to sportswap or sportcheck and get some
9BZ9HbLaaa	is that the one where the horses are wild (all i know is its called new forest i dnt know if its in hampshire, but its in england lol)    if it is then yes, the horses are nice a you get to go upto them and feed them and they just walk about the streets     and its a nice little place    :Dx|`|hFnkvO9taa	Depends   on   how   camp   you  are .

KcR829Edaa	STEELERS BABY!!|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Personally I think you should go to English class.|`|gDKIxwRSaa	I agree with you !!  Steelers all the way baby.|`|4czUd6TJaa	Well I don't know about the "suber bowl" but as for the "Super Bowl" I think the Steelers will win.|`|nltFZcuGaa	cardinals.|`|RUmNeAqYaa	STEELERS!!!!!!|`|AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner|`|xgqevAgIaa	Steelers will win the Super Bowl.  I'll win the Suber Bowl.|`|9fXxZrc1aa	cleveland browns|`|cusAXNIoaa	i'm the only one out of everyone who was in my school that said tht the cadinals would make it to the superbowl and i said tht at the beginning of the wild card. im stickin with em, arizonia all the wayy|`|ntsLyKSSaa	cards|`|7869e9948a0bbdc333e2d7777e511e3baa	More than likely the Steelers... but sure do HOPE it's the Cardinals.

UWctMa0Taa	What's up Detroit King... I get you mixed up with Y/S alllll the time, haha.      I think He's a little off.... Magic's the 3rd, but cleveland and boston have the fight for  1.      But hey, about our pistons... Don't you like that even though these young kiddie teams are getting better records (Lakers, Nuggets, Magic, Cavaliers), But in the 1 on 1 fight, we've beat all them?    Nuggets- last couple minutes  Lakers- ended their undefeated streak  Cavaliers- killed their what, 15 game streak? something like that  Orlando- showed why we were better in the playoffs      The ONLY team we lose to:    BOSTON    :/    haha what do you think|`|aaKYVMk2aa	That's right.|`|98wFqBwSaa	That's just Kenny being Kenny.|`|GBGcI509aa	1.Magic (there my sleeper pick.)  2.Cavs  3.Boston|`|MWTzRUuQaa	I totally agree with what that man says.|`|UMVWQiYJaa	Boston  Cavs  Orlando    gotta knock off the champs first|`|884gmUZBaa	He only said that to get people talking.|`|AA10495394	I think the Magic is the best team in the East I have seen all year|`|vuh0i3Axaa	nope... i agree because if the Cavs or Magic faced Boston right now, Boston would lose.|`|dDhTMacAaa	ahhhhhh Kenny    I'll take the reverse    1.

8XT1Tvcvaa	First off, this is one of the funniest and most ridiculous questions I've ever seen on this site.    Now logistically I think the 10 hour time limit makes it kind of impossible. You'd have to kill 50 third graders per hour without slowing down in order to complete this task. That seems a little too difficult.|`|4t6ABZcfaa	these questions areNOT funny and really do not belong in ANY category here|`|LFWQiGYkaa	No way.    I could probably knock one out cold with every punch, but 500 is way too many. They'd end up swarming me easily.    And to be honest, I couldn't possibly do it. I'd probably just let them kill me. (Since there's no point anyway).|`|5bzJUmh4aa	Great question!  : )    I agree with BKS.  Unless you had some type of weapon, there would be no way to dispatch that many people in time, no matter how skilled you were.  Even if you had a sword or something, you would become exhausted before even got close to getting them all.|`|srD0BYMKaa	lol, this is so fukin funny...    and no, I don't think I could take'em. but for one reason, I'd die of a heart attack, or just pure fatigue.  i think it was b.k.s. that said it'd be 50 kids pure hour and that's alot, could I have like a SAMURAI sword, then I could do it, hahaha.  I think it would be hard for a 3rd grader to hurt me but if they just rush in with no limit though they would all be in there pretty quickly, so assuming they all rush you, it would be hard to keep them off, most likey they'd bite you to death, omg that could spawn cannibalism...wow thought about that a little too much.    good question.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Give me 48 hours and you've got a deal. My minimum price is usually $250,000 per head. But since you're buying in bulk, I'll knock it down to $100,000 per head. I expect $5,000,000 transferred to my bank account 3 months before the event, and the other $5,000,000 before the event is over.

I would smoke them, in a few hours.|`|Vnuh31dFaa	Did you not read the news report of what the 9 3rd grade students tried to do to  there teacher in the plot to kill her.  With a combination of 500 kids some of which who watch and learn different types of skills some who may actually carry pocket knives.  1, 2 ro even 3 maybe 5 kids may not be able to rush you, but 10 can get the best of weather you are fighting back or not.  I don't beleive I could under those circumstances|`|Bo11l8xQaa	Oh my goodness. I love you! Seriously, this had me laughing for about 10 minutes, seriously.     Thank you!!!

br1kwegaaa	I would pick up Ramon Sessions.  He will be getting the majority of minutes for the Bucks w/ Redd being out for the year.  He has averaged 14 ppg in the last 4 games.    I would also pick up Greg Oden.  He has scored in double digits and averaged 11+ boards in his last 5 games|`|JQXCdGHYaa	Definitely Bell and maybe...

I would go with oden for sure if you need three's go with mason. But i like oden and mason or bell.
DfPyyDssaa	There are others.  1.Finlay  2.Sting  3.Hulk Hogan-Even if he only comes back for one match,it's still enjoyable to watch.  4.The Great Muta  5.Terry Funk.|`|WtcTBlccaa	what about shawn michaels he puts on the best show in wwe rite now and in the past and prolly 10 years from now|`|nKSmgjylaa	Nope. HBK and The Undertaker are also getting on and they're still as good as ever. Tommy Dreamer is still keeping it up pretty well too. Finlay isn't the youngest guy out there either I wouldn't think but he is still a great fist fighter. The only older guy who I think needs to go is Hacksaw. I absolutely love him, so I think the WWE should stop ruining his legacy by making a jobber. He should retire soon instead of just fading away and fizzling out into nothing.    EDIT : The guy 2 above me is right too. The TNA Main Event Mafia guys are no spring chickens, but they still amaze me. Even Angle isn't exactly a youngster, but he's an amazingly skilled athlete and his matches are exciting, not just watchable.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	What about Michaels? hes had like 5 straight match of the year winners...|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	wow what about sting nash and steiner|`|VQ7t2jOmaa	not even....STING IS THE man...da dude is like 50 and he still fly's from one end to another, he still has endurance, still has speed, styll can pick up heavy people, still is respected, he is the best overall wrestler off all time.....best 50 old wrestler i've ever seen....    he's still better den most wwe wrestlers....|`|zhXFtgPqaa	I agree with you, but you are forgetting about The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels. Triple H can do it when he wants to, but not all the time. But I forget that each year Kane gets older, because he still puts on great matches and you can't really tell that he is older. This may because he doesn't fly around where you can tell he's slowing down, it power moves and stuff.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	Nope.    I think without Hornswoggle, Finlay is watchable in the ring and can still go with anyone younger than him. Most likely, those guys live healthier lifestyles and didn't do a ton of high-risk maneuvers during their careers.

I have a Mossberg 500 chambered for .410, more challenging then a 20 gauge, cost be about have of the browning :)|`|bB5d5YVeaa	Yes.  I own two of them.  Both are Browning Citori shotguns in .410 bore.    I've also seen the Browning Superposed in .410 as well - but they are quite expensive if you can find one.    They also made their Browning BPS pump-actions on .410.    To the best of my knowledge, the only ones made in Belgium would be the Browning Superposed.  If you find a Browning Superposed in 410 bore, and it's in very good condition, I would suggest you buy it!  Most Superposed shotguns were made in 12 gauge and the smaller gauges are collectors pieces.|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	the first answer you got was a great cut and paste answer but some how i didn't see anything that answered the question  in fact , browning has produced many 410 shotguns  type in browning 410 shotgun and click  lots of info and pics will be there for the reading|`|AA10102776	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=Brow...|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I have never heard of one. but then again, I don't know everything.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	Made 'em last year.    http://www.browning.com|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	A shotgun (also known as a scattergun[1]) is a firearm that is usually designed to be fired from the shoulder, which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a number of small spherical pellets called shot or a solid projectile called a slug. Shotguns come in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 5.5 mm (.22 inch) bore up to 5 cm (2 inch) bore, and in a range of firearm operating mechanisms, including breech loading, double, pump-, bolt-, and lever-action, semi-automatic, and even fully-automatic variants.    The shot pellets from a shotgun spread upon leaving the barrel, and the power of the burning charge is divided among the pellets, which means that the energy of any one ball of shot is fairly low. In a hunting context, this makes shotguns useful primarily for hunting birds and other small game. However, in a military or law enforcement context, the large number of projectiles makes the shotgun useful as a close quarters combat weapon or a defensive weapon. Shotguns are also used for target shooting sports such as skeet, trap, and sporting clays. These involve shooting clay disks, known as clay pigeons, thrown in various ways.    Precursors to the shotgun, such as the musket, were widely used by armies in the 18th century. However, in the 19th century, shotgun-type weapons were largely replaced on the battlefield with rifles, which were more accurate over longer ranges. The decline in military use of shotguns reversed in World War I, when American forces used 12-gauge pump action shotguns in close-quarters trench fighting. Since the end of World War II, the shotgun has remained in use with modern armies mostly in specialist roles, such as door breaching or for naval boarding parties. On the other hand, shotguns have become a standard firearm for law enforcement use in many countries. Police often use specialty less-lethal or non-lethal ammunitions, such as tear gas shells, bean bags, stun rounds, and rubber projectiles.

Got two right now, the Marlin Goose gun, 12 gauge, bolt action, full choke, 36" barrel, and the Marlin Super Goose gun, 10 gauge, bolt action, full choke, 36" barrel.  Those things are a hoot.  For serious duck hunting however, I like either the Benelli Nova pump, or the Remington 870 Super Mag.  Get a synthetic stock, and at least 3" chamber, I prefer 3 1/2", though the bigger shells really aren't all that necessary.  I prefer pumps, because auto's tend to hang up when it starts getting really nasty.

z7f6uYR2aa	most likely, as the new uneducated people taking office are against guns because they only get the bad side of every story. i say get the carbine now...because the ban isn't in effect yet. But the people who make these bans usually go on the looks on a gun, not it's style of shooting. If u took a bolt-action .22lr and dressed it like an ak-47, they would still consider it an assault weapon|`|0lnamekJaa	It is highly likely... I wonder how that will effect the Government's sale of M1 Garands from overstocked military storehouses...    Does anyone know where I can find the clip of the  1 anti-gun nut-job that was on Good Morning America back in the 1990's when the gun guy showed her how a simple change of stock can make a gun go from LOOKING like an assault weapon to looking like a hunting gun?    She was totally humiliated and I LOVED that I was able to catch it when it aired...|`|U0Rvsabdaa	I bet the carbine will since it has a detachable magazine. Since the Garand has an internal one, I think its safe.|`|FhHIAbmLaa	The prior assault ban stated that if the weapon had a detachable box mag, then it can have only one of the following features.    1) A flash suppressor    2) A threaded barrel    3) A pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously.    4) A folding Stock.    Also there were specific guns targeted and none were the M1Carbine. The Garand does not take a detachable box magazine.    Based on the past, no, but your guess is as good as mine.|`|oNg8zGi8aa	As I read it any semi - auto will be tried to be banned rifle and pistol .|`|WBGnXsr7aa	In time if they get their way, everything will be banned.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	There is not going to be an Enforceable Ban by Anyone, Anywhere, at Anytime or there will be a War inside the U.S.A.*...

All I can say is who knows, maybe.    You don't need to wait until they decide to act, you need to write, call or e-mail your elected offical and tell them your opinion on any firearm ban.  You need to tell them their vote for any firearm or ammunition ban means your voting against them in their next election.
f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Hey.  No.  I can answer this because I live in Tx (have for 38 yrs).  If you buy from a dealer you will need to be 21 and pass a background check (it's so efficient now that they just call you're info in and you can usually leave with the gun 10-15 minutes later).    If you buy from an individual you don't have to have the background check.  Just pay and go.  This is what is normally refered to as the "gun show loophole".  It's not a loophole though.  It's completely legal.  "Loophole" is a term thought up by the anti-gunners to make it sound like people are doing something nearly illegal.  It's not.  Done at gun shows every day.|`|kY3uuTq9aa	No, I live in Houston Texas and bought many guns from academy. The only thing you need is a ID, Be 21, and not be a felon.And I think if you have previously been a felon they wont let you get one.

txfebYGVaa	it keeps most of your hair dry|`|akiJ1zJ3aa	NO!!!  I used to be a swimmer and my aunt found me and my cuz some high dollar swim caps. Well we struggled to get them on and they pretty much pulled all our out trying to get the rubber material on our heads. And if that wasn't bad enough they made our hair sweaty and stinky like rubber. They look dumb and don't work. They'll damage your hair worse than the chlorine. I used the green Pantine shampoo and conditioner. I used a lot of conditioner right after swim. And I found its just painful and damaging to your hair to brush it after swim. Hope this helps!|`|deAyKj2Uaa	a swim cap will keep the majority of your hair dry. the edges where the cap meets your head may get damp, but for the most part, your hair stays pretty dry. ive been on the swim team for years, and i love using them!  :) :)|`|bza3rVG9aa	No, a swim cap is designed to keep your hair in place, not to keep it from getting wet. It does help a little with damage, in that the water does not split it as much. But if you have really long hair it does not do much.|`|NCSKeRXTaa	some of it|`|craoWpkraa	no really. it might keep some of it dry but definitely not all of it|`|vECL7f9uaa	no|`|1d075957915818a61f13ee910c562440aa	I used to swim and I can tell you from experience that in order to even get the swim cap on, I would have to dunk my cap in the water.  It really doesn't let a lot of water in but it isn't going to keep your hair dry.|`|TMPoIvDSaa	no|`|995a658571283c8338a57316eb61bc15aa	Generally, no. If you have very long hair, then the cap may keep some of it dry. If it's short or medium-length, then most of it will get wet.    The purpose of a swim cap isn't to keep your hair dry. It's used to keep your hair out of your face, minimize water resistance, and make the goggles fit cleaner.    (Oh, also. I'm Asian, so my hair does okay with latex caps *thin ones*. But some people hate it because they pull on the hair. If you want, you can buy a better silicone cap. It's softer and gentler on the head. I use both.)    If you are swimming, which means you're in water, you should expect your whole body to get wet. I understand the damage chlorine has to hair, but there are ways you can prevent that.    Get the special shampoos for swimmers if you must, but I just use my regular shampoo and conditioner (Pantene: volume). You can also get a bottle of high-quality hair serum that prevents split-ends and keeps it from looking like hay :)|`|FF2eOqrWaa	for the most part, and it has to be a tight enough fit for that to happen.

XCyvQl8maa	No. the key to a fastskin is you want it to be as dry as possible before the race. it'll just feel like a tight swimsuit. warm up in your regular suit and then once your done warming up change into the fastskin. when the race is over dry it off as best as you can. also the less you wear it the longer it'll work so don't wear it in practice or anything save it for the meets.|`|zmhQdYbDaa	I am right with you! I am purchasing an FS Pro for the first time and am in the same situation.    Here is what I will do:    I am going to do my team warm-up in my regular practice suit. When my team is done warming up I will dry off and change. Then I will go into the warm-up pool and warm up there to get a feel of how the FS Pro works.    I hope that was helpful!|`|Vk1rMpbZaa	no warm up in your practice suit and change into your fast skin before the race. make sure you dry off real good before putting it off it is painful. the less times you wear your fastskin the better it will work so only for meets!|`|YHtpB3wBaa	Your problem is one I have heard and had many times. The best solution is to wear your Fastskin Pro to a practice a few days before your meet. Wear it for warm up, but make sure that you also do some fast swimming in it as that will also feel different. Try to wear it for some type of sprint set, especially if you are pushing the 15 m mark of starts, because with a Fastskin, you will have to take fewer kicks to get to the same spot. On the meet day warm up in your normal suit and then dry off completely before you change; Fastskins are almost impossible to put on when you are wet.|`|AA11177360	NNOOO dont wear fastskins for warmups!   dont worry it wont mess you up, you just feel faster, and just work with it during your races. Fastskins can only be worn a few times before they loose their "magic" so....    ...im guessing this is for a big meet, so what i do is wear a suit and drag suit for warmups, then before your first race change into the fastskin.     gooood luuck

OmSesMMkaa	I am going to say that you are doing a tack start.   -First, make sure that your feet are straight, and your toes on your front foot curl on the edge. When you put your hands down on the edge, put thumbs up for support so you don't fall, and lean forward not back. It wastes time to go all the way back to get where you were up front. Make sure your head is tucked down.  -Second, "rip" the block off with your arms. Just throw yourself forward with your arms is what it means. Jump with your legs outward. Also, fling your head upwards, like you were throwing a bowling ball up. It makes you go higher and farther.   -Streamline position, and then when you hit the water you want to go in like you are going through a hula hoop. Then when you hit the water arch your back so you don't go to the bottom, and go as fast as possible.  -Then do your kicks/pullout.  -Then when you get to the surface break out, and swim your heart out!|`|EtWIJrR2aa	ok try pushing oof the platform or poolside and instead of jumping straight forwar, tilt your hands and therefore head toward the water    once you hit the water with your hands or whenver you realise you are on the water, do the two leg flutter kick to the surface then sprint as you normally would in freestyle|`|MSR76R3caa	Ever think of asking your coach?|`|R02aazVdaa	+ Ask your coach to help you with your dive. They can tell you what you are doing wrong.     + Make sure your goggles are on securely. It is very easy for them to fall off or fill with water when you hit the surface.    + Try to jump horizontally for distance, but then enter the pool vertically, keeping you legs straight.    + Practice, but not too much. It is more important to improve your stroke and turns. You only dive in once after all.|`|eS5CdgOOaa	i'm on a high school swim team too and over the years i've gotten my start pretty good (well... usually).  usually if you're belly flopping it means that you're not really diving into the water, but more of falling (sorry). just make sure that you are in streamline when you enter the water, and try and go at more of a downward angle. that way when you enter the water, you'll already be in streamline and it'll help your times.  another tip is making sure you push straight off the block with some upward force. but you don't want to go too far up, because that could slow you down.    the best way to improve your starts, is just keep practicing them, and make sure to ask your coaches for help.    hope i helped and good luck!!!|`|aTwEUANXaa	also, remember to pull with your arms too.    they dont have you hold on to the block just for balance.

aDNdND6oaa	Early on, the toms tend to be likely to go towards the hens.  I like a jake and two hen combo.  I've had mature birds shy away from "pretty boys", just because they appear to be a dominant bird in size, doesn't mean that's the case.  I've had them lock up and not come any farther, on the other hand, never has this happened with a jake decoy.|`|wmhwBhv8aa	I agree, jake and two hens.  Good hunting.|`|BFBEOJsvaa	For a change-up, four or five hens can be the ticket. No jakes or toms.

vuMHJaCraa	Its never to late to start skating =]    I'm 17 now and have been skating for a year and i love it. I don't know how far you want to go with it but if you have the opportunity to put the hours in you will do fine.Mostly the biggest challenge is being older there is a lot more fear and your not as bendy but you can work on that.     some rinks also do older classes and as for it being degrading everyone has to start somewhere no ones looking at the older girl making a couple of mistakes, and if they do well they can just go away.    you should go for it, its better to try it out and if it doesn't work out oh well rather than not try and regret it. Good luck!|`|IWvJk4gCaa	Yes! that's fine at my rink there are many older figure skaters and even adults that are very good. You  just have to work harder than the kids who are like 8. I think you should definatly try it if it's something you want to do. I started when I was 11 and I'm 15 now. I have pretty much caught up to the people that started when they were younger. You just have to be very commited. you should go for it.    depending on what rink you go to there might even be a class for older teens that want to start. I think you should look into it. Its so much fun|`|zwsdYR3Vaa	i think its to late, but its up to u|`|ioCVcGDuaa	there are very good skaters who are older and started later. but unlike in ice princess, the olympics are not in your future.     just work at your own pace.|`|bvnzv923aa	I'm sorry, but it is just a little too late. You could try, but you have to know that there is a very slim chance that you would be anywhere near olympic level or anything. You'd have to take lessons with a bunch of little kids who are just starting out and that has to be degrading. Also, people who go through the levels really fast, do not look nearly as graceful or coordinated on the ice as the people who started when they were younger. There is an age where you physically stop getting better at skating, that is early adulthood, so you are pretty close to that already. You can start, just as long as you do not have ridiculously high expectations for yourself.|`|1dh5xbQ6aa	It is fine but if you want to compete you  are going to have to put some serious hours in. as long as you have a good coach it's not a big deal|`|MIfgWW7Eaa	yes u should try it out! ???

jTaW3goeaa	start small, don't go right to the biggest jump.  You want to get enough speed to clear the flat part of the jump and land on the part that is sloped downward but not go too fast so you completely fly over the jump.  You want to land on the downward part of the jump because it helps absorb the impact.  If you get real high and land on the flat of a jump its going to hurt a lot|`|C5DG4nOUaa	when you are riding towards the jump bend your knees the right before you go off the jump straighten yor body and jump a little you will get insane air

IJfUZeBUaa	You can not train a boxer after sitting in a hour seminar.   You don't learn boxing overnight.  You don't play or do Boxing.  Don't buy Boxing equipment from a Sports Store.

AA10199454	Here's an idea for you.  Tie a string to a ball like a tennis ball and then hang it at eye or chin level.  Then push it out to make it swing back and forth.      Don't really look at it but try to sense it or pick it up with your peripheral vision.  Practice "slipping" it and practice your foot work by moving all around it while it swings.  Never jump too far out of the way because you want to "slip" an attack but still be in good position for a counter before they can reset.    Also, keep your head up and your eyes open.    I do Krav Maga, it's not asian and doesn't sound like it.  maybe your parents would approve of that.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	read some books by bruce lee that helps|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	THE ADRENALINE DRIVE OF REAL COMBAT WHICH EVERYONE MISTAKES AS EXPERIENCING FEAR CAUSES "TUNNEL VISION" SO TRYING TO SEE EVERY ATTACK IS IMPOSSIBLE .YOU MUST ACT AGGRESSIVELY TO COUNTER THE INITIAL ATTACK AND END THE FIGHT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ANYTHING ELSE IS JUST SPARRING.SORRY FOR THE CAPS KEY IS STUCK|`|1oMjCTGVaa	get a friend who trains in your art with you, who you may regularly hang out with and try 'slow speed' hand sparring    i quote slow speed because it shouldnt be so slow that each person can block every punch successfully, and you dont have to hit eachother (when face striking.. if you wanted to hit bodies you could i suppose)    other than this you could do real sparring occasionally, dont be too obsessed with seeing (reacting) to attacks as they come, that comes in time with training in your art (sparring/ chi sau if you do wing chun) and as your focus develops through regular training        hope i helped|`|H9Raobbzaa	Use periferal vision to detect his entiere body especially his shoulder muscles telegraphing his intensions prior to his attacks.  Forget the chicken stare out used in sports competitions, unless you are about 18 feet apart, because closer than that will use a different and slower process and tunnel vision.  Instead look to the sternum or heart chakra region.  Your range of vision will increase if you tilt your head slightly forwards, thereby allowing you to see behind yourself.  This is essential in fighting multiple oponents!  The link below for night vision is interesting also and will help.  Get a jump rope to coordinate your feet and a speed bag to coordinate your hands.  Also, consider learning a FMA sinawalli drill called redondo.  Practice blocks and choking against your own legs while you sit on the floor watching tv.

Or maybe Ted Turner for shits and giggles.|`|zhXFtgPqaa	I was thinking for a minute that it would happen this year, and it's still not impossible, but I think that it will probably happen after he retires, maybe within the next 5 years, WrestleMania 30, Shane and Steph will most likely induct him.

EtWIJrR2aa	heya    um some weights but not very heavy and lots of reps (will build muscle)     and you needa work on ur technique, so yup graba floatie thing put it between your knees and swim, its so that you only use your arms and dont drown while ur at it, helps tons and you end up focusing on arms     o and this is a drill we got taught today, if u find a mate keen on swimming as well basicly get him to grab your ankles and tail beihind you, so that you do the pulling for both of you, no legs, to start with he can kick a little but after a few trainings of that, he should just dangle like a dead weight    works super well  o and you needa do reps of it like do 50 m, you pull, then swap so he pulls you for 50m and keep swapping till exhausted :)|`|D1lJorh8aa	try weight lifting... just 5 or 10 lbs... it worked for me!|`|LjR1vbl8aa	Weight lifting is an ok idea but I don't believe you NEED that to improve you 50. To improve your stroke power, or just to improve pulling without kicking, you need to pull your stomach in and squeeze your butt cheeks together. After years of being told this from my coach I can guarantee it actually works. Also, you need to follow through with your pull. I recommend catch up drill where you don't take another stroke until your second hand has hit the first one. It makes you focus on the initial part of your pull which is essential, then causes you to fully finish it as well.   Good Luck!|`|nr5VfSguaa	Don't use free weights. Try using cords! I dropped three seconds on my 50 free!
TFJ4KXxraa	Medium is good, but I'd say that if you think you are going to gain a lot of weight, like 20 or 30 pounds in the next year then it's your call, but for your weight, the Pro medium is right.

The red head girl and the 2 boys were from STORIES that the blonde large girl in the phsyco ward told Anna/Mildred. The necklace also was put into her mind by stories that she also told her.|`|vmbq8s6Oaa	1. she was psychotic. she had hallucinations.  2. she pushed him off a cliff subconsiously.  3. nope. she just made it up in her mind.  4. it was really just medicine to calm her down [because she was a nurse.]  5.she said "you're next"  6. she was one of the 3 children mildred kemp murdered. mildred kemp was really the woman across from her in he mental hopsital.    HOPE THAT HELPED!|`|rPk46Eniaa	1)she was psychotic  2)the girl pushed him off the cliff  3)no  4)because it was the girl's medicine to calm her down  5)UR NEXT!! lol  6)to make you think that the stepmom killed her, but it was really mildred kimp, the girl's psycho roomate|`|A71xjYSKaa	1. she was hallucinating because she went crazy about her father cheating on her sick mom and her mom dying, so so thought her sister was alvie, even though she died in the fire also  2. she blacked out and killed the boyfriend so she let him fall over the rock  3. the girlfriend wasn't really crazy, anna made it up in her mind. the lady was really a nurse and she was trying to help anna, but in anna's mind, she was a killer  4. the girlfriend was a nurse, it was really a medicine to help her calm down  5. the little girl said "your next"  6. the red headed girl was one of the murdered children. she was in the movie to throw the viewers off to make it look like the blonde lady was a murderer  :) it was a really good movie|`|6OAxXpTjaa	1. She was psychotic or CRAZY as you would say.  2. He saw how her sister and mother died in the fire, and since Anna left the gasoline thing on, it was her fault. Then he told her that he saw what happen that night but in her mind she thought that her dad's girlfriend killed her mom but the boy knew she did. So, i guess when she wasnt imagining things, she killed him so no one would know.  3.That lady was never evil, she was just a nurse there to take care of her, and also be her dad's girlfriend.  4.It was her medicine to calm her down.  5."Your Next"  6.Her name was Iris, and she was murder along with her 2 brothers by a nurse who tried to get married with their dad.  Iris was there to make Anna think that Rachel(dad's girlfriend)was the nanny who "got married with their dad and killed the children." And that Rachel was there to do the same thing to her and her sister Alex(who never was really there).              I LOVED the movie.  the ending was such a surprise to me.  i recommend this to everyone.  i screamed really loud when The red hair girl pop out from under the oven.

NKN7HwkYaa	I think its a coaching issue mostly. They got Iverson, but they don't know what to do with him. He's a great player, but it seems as though he can't find his place, or his role on the floor. Also, they other players, don't seem to know what to do when he's on the floor either.<br>  The coach needs to cut out clear roles for everyone in the lineup, and enforce them. and Iverson has to learn how to play when he's not "the guy"|`|sBrYcT5daa	Because of the Iverson - Billups trade. Simple as that.<br>  <br>  Look at the Nuggets this season without AI and with Billups. They are a far better team, because of Billups who knows how to play a TEAMgame. He distributes well and is a good shooter, too.<br>  Iverson has always been overrated. In a bad team he can be a standout and score like 50 points per game, because every ball goes to him (76ers). In Denver he took away to much from Anthony and the rest of the team to play his one man show. In Detroit he does not seem to be part of the team at all, and the Pistons won't let him take over and perform his "all about me" game.|`|AA10513544	the pistons continue to go on a downward spiral with no end. the beginning of their undoing started when they traded ben wallace, without him they lost a defensive presence in the middle. and then trading billups for iverson was a big mistake. the 01-04 pistons were a team made up of not so great players that together played great. remember in a team you dont want 5 great players but 5 players that can play great together.|`|Jhid3yhxaa	Simply put .. they just have no more chemistry.

kDshEkXraa	Basically the Sharks were screwed by the refs, intentional or not.  The goal was in, there was no difinitive view otherwise.  I'm watching it on a 50' high def screen and I don't see a definitive view otherwise.  But they screw us out of it.  Secondly the refs called 4 ridiculous penalties against us in the first period setting the tone for the game.  Not one of these calls was a penalty.  However the Wings can head hunt on our #1 guy and it is a 2 minuet boarding???<br>  <br>  So heading into the second period we are down 2 goals after being on the penalty kill for nearly the whole first 1/3rd of the game and having to battle back the whole game, the wings could play a posession style hockey and make it damn near impossible.  <br>  <br>  I don't 100% blame the refs.  Nabby let in some softies, and the Wings played well as they obviously do.  Doesn't change the fact that the Sharks got screwed.  I almost guarantee if someone went back and looked at the video of the Sharks 9 "penalties" at least 5 should have been non calls.|`|AA10068004	In regards to your example...Something you need to realize. Its a fact that refs tend to see and penalize retaliation more often than they call penalties on the infraction that started it. Always been that way and if you watch enough games TV analysts, coaches, and media say it all the time.|`|3ULjjUNlaa	If your going to rant you need to make it worth while and get your facts straight, Boyle got checked and broke Datsyuk's stick out of anger.  <br>  <br>  And to answer your question, no, there not, is San Jose only allowed 1 PPG per 7 chances on the road?  Darn that Bettman!|`|t14Jk1IPaa	Ya the NHL just made that rule that Detroit doesn't get penalties, give me a break.|`|HJuOSvmdaa	San Jose had 7 powerplay chances big shot.<br>  <br>  Edit**<br>  <br>  I think you are talking about Datsyuk and Boyle?

You really think the Wings committed more penalties than the Sharks? What game were you watching?!|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	So your telling me that San Jose didn't make a bunch or careless penalties? Or didn't have any powerplay chances themselves?  I knew this would happen... Wings win and people find things to b - i - t - c -h  about. Typical. The Wings clearly outplayed the Sharks. <br>  <br>  Quick reminder... who let up a short handed goal? If you are doing that, your not going to win games. <br>  <br>  This was a penalty filled game back and forth.|`|AA11674745	Every team, in every game, no matter where they are playing, will get some calls that go their way and some that won't. The better teams figure out how to win despite which calls are made. The Red Wings are the class of the league and San Jose has yet to show otherwise.|`|AA10960806	No, they had 7 penalties actually.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Sharks fan? Nabokov improved to 7-15 against the Wings and moved his GAA closer to 4 GAA versus them. But with that said it was a regualr season game...it meant 2 points to the Wings and both move on to their next game....no big deal. And the refs didnt outplay the Sharks...the Wings did. Just like when the Sharks beat the Wings....they won because they were better on those nights...no excuses!<br>  <br>  Datsyuk checked him (legal last I knew...great hip check, Boyle slashed Pavels stick in 2...penalty last I knew)...end of game...9 penalties for SJ, 8 for the Wings (this includes Blake at the end of the game, so basically 8 penalties for each side, are the rules supposed to be that the Wings get more penalties or the refs are "cheating"?) so please no excuses.

I can't believe people would go around saying stuff they don't know the facts about!! <br>  here watch this video...it explains it all...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ime5NFfZ_dQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ime5NFfZ_...</a><br>  <br>  EVERYONE watch it...and stop spreading things you know nothing about.|`|7sa6B6Qhaa	I was a Goldust, and a Dustin  fan in general honestly, but he's nowhere near as talented in the ring as he once was.<br>  <br>  I just recently watched an interview with Cody in it where he was talking about growing up during a time when his father and his brother were on the outs, and the only real way he got to see his brother was by watching wrestling, and he was very impressed by the reaction Dustin got, and acted as if he were mesmerized and proud of what his brother was accomplishing at the time.|`|FGmEoXw9aa	Saw the video of Cody commenting on GoldDust along time ago maybe a few years ago or when it first was released, he feels proud being his younger brother. The GoldDust gimmick is one of the most memorable gimmicks out there to date, thats why he did it.<br>  I also think Dustin did that so he can be more recognizable because if he hadnt he would be just a average Joe wreslter, he had alot of innovative moves especially "Shattered Dreams"<br>  But in my opinion, its too bad cody was too young and couldn't join Dustin in his Prime, Dustin probably wouldnt never been Golddust, but they could have been great tag partners if they were to join at the same time.|`|1UKAho1iaa	I think he might be a little embarrassed, especially since Cody is trying to establish himself as a wrestler from an impressive bloodline. Gold Dust is a freak, so he might tarnish that image a little bit.|`|pT0SjzZGaa	Goldust Is 1 of The Most Unique Intercontinental Champions Of all Time,  So I think Cody Does Or Should Feel Proud to Be His Brothers,<br>  He Also Most Likely Gets a Chuckle from it time to time|`|K2mXhSGlaa	I bet Cody Rhodes gets a good chuckle out of seeing Dustin dressed as the semi-androgynous "Goldust".

I think to win the division, they have to win against Pittsburg later in the season.|`|AA10939368	The Ravens are very good no doubt, but they have yet to play and win to a team with a winning record.  Their win today was a must.  They need to prove themselves over the next few games, these are the toughest games on their schedule and they are all clumped together.  |`|GZVTLPwuaa	It's nice to see another Ravens fan on Yahoo answers =) Are you a member on the boards? Anyways, I was very shocked by alot of things in this game as we improve to a suprising 6-3(hopefully indy beats the steelers today!!!) which will tie us in the division as we are only ONE game behind the steelers..It's awesome to have so much diversity on the team.. Teams dont know who to study MORE one week we pull out RICE & mason.. next week its HEAP & mcgahee.. next week we should start mclain and have clayton be our top receiver.. haha seriously though Im so happy with how well we are devolpoing as an offense and how DOMINATE our D contiunes to be.. A saftey by suggs, INT. by rolle & 2 by Ray lewis... Its a proud day for ravens fans.. but My hopes arent TOO high just yet.. we do have to play the giants next week.. but we beat the browns TWICE and if they can beat  the giants than so the hell can we!|`|QW3tkVt7aa	"Did you see us destroy the Texans??? What I seen today was SUPER BOWL MATERIAL"<br>  <br>  That made me giggle a little bit.  <br>  <br>  They had a good game and Flacco has been impressive in recent weeks.  But, really, I wouldn't get too excited about beating the Texans.  <br>  |`|UgzAWKQSaa	The Ravens do look very good and Joe Flaco is having a amazing season, that's the good news.  The bad news is that the Steelers will win their 6th Super Bowl this year.|`|kmeddhR1aa	They're good, but it's not like the Texans are the best team around.|`|mj934lWtaa	I too am a Ravens fan and here's how I see it<br>  <br>  Week 1, Cincinnati- Yeah they were a bad team, but still we beat them and isn't that what good teams do?<br>  Week 3, Cleveland- Same as Cincinnati, good teams beat bad teams<br>  Week 4, @ Pittsburgh- We went into Pittsburgh and outplayed an elite team, losing in overtime.<br>  Week 5, Tennessee- We outplayed the BEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE, and lost on a bad call at the end of the game.<br>  Week 6, @ Indianapolis- I'll be the first to admit, this was bad, but it happens.<br>  Week 7, @ Miami- We beat Miami pretty well, and this is a team that has a winning record and is in the playoff race.<br>  Week 8, Oakland-  Yeah, Oakland is a terrible, terrible team but we beat them really well so, I'm fine with that.<br>  Week 9, @ Cleveland- We went on the road, got behind by a couple of bad calls (come on, neither of those touchdowns in the second half by Cleveland were really touchdowns) but still mounted a great comeback and won the game.<br>  Week 10, @ Houston- We just went into Houston who is 3-1 at home and blew them out, big time.<br>  <br>  If you notice, in only one of those games did the Ravens get outplayed, and we played 2 elite teams.  We have one of the best defenses in the league and have found a mystical thing that until now Baltimore fans had only heard of, an offense.  Flacco is improving every week, and even with injuries the Ravens are still playing extremely well.  I don't think they'll win the superbowl, but I think they will at least get a wild card.<br>  <br>  I just don't get why so called experts still keep ranking us so low.|`|StuXqez7aa	GO RAVENS!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Cam Cameron has transformed our offense to new levels and all these ESPN anylists don't give Flacco the credit he deserves.  However, I will actually be rooting for the Steelers so the Ravens can have a clear path to the wild-card.  Besides, the Ravens play the Steelers later this year and we will beat their @SS then.  McGahee, Rice, McClain IS the three headed monster.  Derrick Mason might be the only good target, but he is a DEFINATE pro bowler.<br>  <br>  Since your also a Ravens fan, I would like to point out that Tennessee game was BU!!SH*T.  Jeff Fisher probably paid that dumb@$$ ref.  We will beat them and the Refs in the playoffs.|`|AA10182327	Yeah, I was surprised at the score. Changed to watch a little of the pre-race coverage and turned back to see a 41 next to BAL!! HELLZ yeah!! I am fearfull for the rest of the season as they are difficult teams to beat but if Flacco continues to improve as he has shown and said, then we should put up a good fight. <br>  Awesome game today!|`|uGXwdy5aaa	**** yeah!<br>  <br>  GOOOOOOOOO RAVENS!<br>  <br>  SUPERBOWL, HERE WE ******' COME!<br>  <br>  >D<br>  <br>  That rookie, #9 I think, I forgot his name though, a 51 yd Field Goal his FIRST TIME IN THE NFL. He's off to a great start!<br>  <br>  Once again... GOOOOOOOOOOO RAVENS! MUAHAHAHA.<br>  <br>  Haters can kick.

gYRfWcleaa	I totally agree! This season the Ravens have been pulling out all kinds of surprises. Everyone thought it was going to be Troy Smith starting and then he got sick so here comes Joe Flacco the rookie and he is improving every week! Another player who is kicken butt and not getting much attention for it is Ray Rice. That little guy is a powerhouse! <br>  Ravens almost beat the Titans who are undefeated. They lost by a field goal in the last 2 minutes. Ravens lost to the Steelers  in OT. <br>  The only team that really destroyed the Ravens in a game was the colts. <br>  I'm proud of the Ravens this year everyone thought this season would be just practice for the Rookie QB but it has proven otherwise. |`|vdh6cwUvaa	For me, I would rather want my team to go under the radar than people overestimating them.|`|6otcNxxFaa	They are like my Titans, who by the way are 9-0! Not real high powered offenses but great defenses.  Our teams only get noticed when we make it to and win superbowls seemingly all of a sudden. Defense wins championships!|`|eoHvleGnaa	Ravens are doing surprisingly good|`|C5DfzJ4Jaa	I LOVE MY TITANS! THE NEWS MEDIA ONLY NEEDS TO COVER GOOD TEAMS! TITANS WILL GO TO THE PLAYOFFS AND WIN! WE WILL WIN THE SUPERBOWL!|`|01MrZwRuaa	What station are you watching. NBC mentioned the Ravens winning their game.|`|mj934lWtaa	Because they aren't as interesting.  They don't have the high powered offense (or at least no one thought they did).  The media likes covering teams that consistantly put up a lot of points that have a lot of stars, like the Cowboys or Patriots.  Also almost everyone thought (and probably still thinks) that the Steelers will win the division.  A lot of "experts" think they won't even make the playoffs.  The Ravens are serriously underestimated.

Ciao|`|0b42e5d8620fdb13dab415f329ffbebdaa	Alonso c'ha il fiatone gi da un pezzo mentre Shumacher che ha un p stentato all'inizio ora arriva di gran carriera, l'ha gi raggiunto e la manovra di sorpasso  quasi ultimata, manca solo l'ultimo sforzo.  Shumacher ha senz'altro bravura ed esperienza sufficienti per spuntarla alla fine!  Alonso lo strxxxo si lamenta tanto e non fa che parlare di complotto ai suoi danni per assegnare il titolo al suo rivale, ma intanto era lui che c'aveva il must damper nascosto nel musetto della sua Renault, che gli ha dato un innegabile vantaggio per quasi due anni, la cui esistenza  stata a lungo ignorata, poi per un p tollerata ed in fine giudicata irregolare!  E' meglio se si sta zitto.  Non dico tanto, ma se gli avessero levato anche un solo punto per ogni gara in cui l'ha utilizzato, la storia di questo mondiale sarebbe stata scritta diversamente e il titolo di campione del mondo assegnato gi da tempo al legittimo detentore, cio Shumacher.  A mio avviso anche quello dell'anno scorso andrebbe messo in discussione.  Ci nonstante devo ammettere che anche Alonso  un grandre pilota, il migliore subito dopo Shumy, Raikkonen, Massa, Fisichella, Trulli, De la Rosa, Ralfh Shumacher, Kubica, Haidfelde, Cuolthard, Liuzzi, Webber, Klien, Albers, Monteyro, Barrichello, Batton e un paio di altri talentuosi di cui ora non mi sovviene il nome...|`|554925803a30fb4ccad536a19d5a3b03aa	A parte ke si scrive Renault (laurea in francese) mi auguro che vinca Alonso, ma secondo me, x una questione di audience, x far finire la carriera del tedesco in grande, lo faranno vincere a lui!

Even ECW is live...  All I know is that if SmackDown was half as good as you want to think it is it would be live, too.

126986d456c7650b3fab46b5cfe905a1aa	Dude -- I feel your pain! But here's what you gotta do. You gotta drop Brand and T-Mac, first of all. They're worthless to you now. Then you gotta pick up the two hottest free agents you can find. May not be much, but trust me just get them. Then pick on the the people who are at the bottom of your league, and most suredly need help. Package one of your best players with one of your free agent pickups and try to get two guys that can help you out.<br>  <br>  For example, I traded Stoudemire and a peon for Troy Murphy and Randy Foye.<br>  <br>  Earlier, I had traded Al Jefferson and Brandon Roy for Zach Randolph, Amare Stoudemire, and Chris Duhon.<br>  <br>  Randolp got hurt...but Stoudemire and Duhon helped me win games anyway. Then Jefferson went down for the year after Randolph got back, and it was clear I had made the right move. Roy's putting up big numbers, but Randolph and Stoudemire matched what he did. Roy only puts up Points and subpar assists and rebounds. Duhon more than makes up for the Assists (almost double) and Randolph takes care of the rebounds and points.<br>  <br>  Right now, I'm trying to offer Joe Johnson and Randy Foye for Charlie Villanueva and Mo Williams. This trade is pretty even, but I screwed up and now I only have one SF. So I need another SF.<br>  <br>  Don't give up Buddy, try to package someone who only helps you in one category like Brandon Roy and put him with a DJ Augustin, and try to get like a Pau Gasol and a Richard Jefferson or something.<br>  <br>  You said you're in 4th place, that means you're in the playoffs, so all you have to do is win 5 categories every week and you win. So get guys that'll help you in those 5 categories. Try not to depend on FG% or FT% as those are tricky.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|vGRs2kApaa	well budy you should have picked the best players in the league like dwyane wade or kobe bryant...|`|AA11322117	Never quit my friend.  Keep fighting the good fight.<br>  <br>  Next year, join a keeper league, they make injuries more tolerable because there's always next year.

Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).<br>  <br>  Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off. <br>  <br>  PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Steelers over the Cards, 30 17|`|FmZyN6ORaa	Cardinals 31-27|`|AA11691880	steelers 31<br>  cards 24

Good luck !|`|4a8ae3e181018ca59d6275c697ea66d3aa	running back :)|`|AA11225694	Kicker|`|7dddb70831f829f0f6ae2ac383238f06aa	If you're fast and strong, why aren't you aggressive?  Hate to bring the R letter into the equation but if you are W, play OL, if you are B, play corner or safety.  Everybody wants to be a receiver, it's a crowd and it's hard to make the team.|`|AA11941377	Receiver|`|AA10333764	Water boy|`|AA11887029	I agree with Mr. Nice Guy  If you want to play football, then you need to have some agression, every position needs it.  Just go to your local club and enquire what they think would be best for you, they won't put you in a position that they don't think that you won't be able to handle.|`|AA11363372	No aggression. Your position should be on the bench.|`|AA11612726	My father signed me up for pee wee footbal because he thought I was not agreesive enough. You may not think you are a gressive now, but once you strap the pads on and get popped once or twice, you will find it in you! I guarantee it. If you are fast and strong, Outside line Backer, tight end (pending on size) or Reciever.|`|e4529a8e6f2159864c909c9c2a566e18aa	i would say corner ! depends how your agility is, bottom line if your just now trying to figure out your spot you might as well not even try !|`|AA11991368	well let's see, no line on either side of the ball, not even tight end... inside linebacker maybe... maybe receiver........ quarter back or running back... however that not too aggressive part kinda takes out a lot, most likely either quarter back or wide receiver

eB8ve6zOaa	I think Delhomme is the definate start because they are playing ATL, then i would probably go with Farve, just because they won't be able to run on TEN so Farve will be forced to throw....just be wary of the interceptions, but they could actually bet them and they played well against the patriots with no pics! 
kGXU1Dotaa	I think he'll help but the team is really bad i don't expect them to go far again this yr.|`|3fPww4aoaa	hes not gna be a sole factor in them getting to the playoffs. it was more just a legacy move rather then an improvement
dzXEM4Adaa	well. start cutler (raider are bad)<br>  start all running backs except leon washington (he's a kick returner) and sammy morris (hes not that great, injured as well-i think)<br>  start all WRs as well except Deon Branch (got a bad heel)<br>  i have to say to start Fasano. you dont want to leave it empty or i can recomment picking up Kevin Boss. i have him. does pretty good. not great. <br>  Start John Kasey (i have him as well)<br>  and since u have no one else start the Jets. (i own the giants) <br>  Hope i help enough|`|1oh4BN32aa	Skip your TE, he sucks. I have him. Start Kasay at K. Kickers are all the same anyway.<br>  <br>  Start Cutler against the Raiders because they are the Raiders. And because McNabb had a crap week and i don't believe in him this week.<br>  <br>  It's a little confusing how your flex spots work but i'm guessing that you have 5 spots and 2 have to be WRs and one has to be RB. Its tough to sit LT. So don't. Start him. DeAngelo Williams has been hot. Start 'im. Start Moss because Seattle isn't so hot on defense. Start Braylon Edwards because he really seems to be Quinn's go-to guy. One more spot. Tough call. Its down to Jamal Lewis and Calvin Johnson.<br>  Lewis is the safe play for a few points, Johnson is the deep TD pass. Do you need a lot of points to win this one? or are you looking pretty good against your opponent? if it's a longshot, start Johnson, you'll need the luck & explosiveness. If its going to be close, play it safe and go with an RB who gets a lot of touches.|`|VllgNosWaa	First check your injury report....if none of these are injured I would start<br>  Cutler     Tomlinson    Williams    Lewis    Jackson    Edwards    Johnson    Moss    Kasay  and of course Jets.
d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Because of the matchups.  Philly is a 14-point favorite in week 15, while Denver is a 7.5 point underdog.<br>  <br>  McNabb and company are playing at home against a severely depleted Cleveland team that can't move the ball (Braylon Edwards was already slumping, now they've lost Winslow to injury, plus they're down to their 3rd-string QB Ken Dorsey) So the Eagles will probably have great field position all night long.<br>  <br>  Denver on the other hand, must travel east (and west coast teams have a dismal record travelling east this season) to face the Division leading Carolina Panthers with their nuclear-powered running game that just trampled the Bucs last night. If they can run on Tampa, then Denver (who hasn't stopped anybody's running attack) is in deeper trouble than GM and Chrysler.  <br>  <br>  Carolina's pass defense is solid, and Denver just lost Hillis for the season, so they've got NO running backs left... Oh wait, they're trying Tatum Bell, whatever he's got left in the tank.  Selvin Young still isn't back from his groin injury.<br>  <br>  Without any running theat to worry about, Carolina can just play pass every down, drop into coverage and keep extra defensive backs on the field.  Play-action doesn't work without a running threat that teams must respect.  While Cutler still has Marshall, Royal and Scheffler it's harder to complete passes when the defense doesn't have to worry about defending the run.  <br>  <br>  Fnally, Denver has a comfortable 3-game lead in the AFC West while Carolina is only one game ahead of 9-4 Tampa and 8-5 Atlanta.  The Panthers need this game much more, and they'll be motivated.  Cutler has been kinda streaky this year, some days he's hot, others he's not.  McNabb is on a roll and feeling good after beating the Giants.<br>   <br>  The high-powered Denver offense might not get enough posessions to put up many points because Carolina can just grind it out with long, clock-killing drives.|`|fEgJa48iaa	With Cutler you never know which Cutler will show up to the game. He's to inconsistent and Mcnabb has been hot since being pulled.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to ya|`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	cutler.<br>  people feel mcnabb got his mojo back.<br>  cutler still is a fantasy gem.|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	Denver just lost  peyton hillis and  teams from  now on are  going to gear  up for the pass since god knows who will be at running back  for the broncos.   um  the panthers are gonna cream the broncos in week 15 .   it  sucks to be  brandon marshall though. you never  know though with either qb   they could be hot one week then  ice cold the next.  i would say  take mcnabb  because he has westbrook  and kevin curtis and  desean jackson to throw to. 
CMpyekpNaa	ok. i play for my school team, so i'am the person to ask.<br>  <br>  Firstly learn that there are 5 positions in the team: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sol/shared/bsp/hi/image_maps/05/9/1127724246/img/image.gif:" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sol/shared/bsp/hi/...</a><br>  POINT GUARD - he is the smallest person, who is fast and who can drilble the ball --like this photo<br>  <a href="https://www.hvcc.edu/athletics/mbasketball/gallery/2_17_05columbiagreene/images/drive_basket_1_jpg.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://www.hvcc.edu/athletics/mbasketba...</a><br>  SHOOTING GUARD - he is similar to POINT GUARD but a bit taller. He usually the one who has a good shot.<br>  <a href="http://images.wikia.com/openserving/sports/images/thumb/c/ce/Kobe_Bryant.jpg/250px-Kobe_Bryant.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.wikia.com/openserving/spor...</a><br>  SMALL FORWARD - he is the one who takes the ball from side to other side.-like a baller in cricket- without the baller it is hard to take wickets- and it is same for the basketball.<br>  POWER FORWARD - he is a tall, strong and athletic guy, who can put the ball in the basket. <a href="http://www.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/051011-F-0000R-008.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/p...</a><br>  and 5 guy CENTRE FORWARD- he is the tallest guy in the team and playes the same role like POWER FORWARD but from middle. <a href="http://www.slamdunkcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/capt_669cbd2be840467fbb8d345570fb8e0b_supersonics__suns_basketball_pnu104.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.slamdunkcentral.com/wp-conten...</a><br>  <br>  And the rules:<br>   the minute your player touch the ball, you get aproximetly 30 minutes- to go for an attack from your end and to the opposite end. - Basicly your team has to be fast and can't keep the ball just to your-self and playing in only your end.<br>  <br>  Small Forward, Power Forward and Centre Forward plays the key roles to keep the team in balence both from attack and defence. In attack obviously the big guys will find it easy to shoot then small guys and in defending Big Guys also find it easy to defence. <br>  But small guys like Point Guard and Shooting Guard also plays a role because when you start to get the ball from your end to other end your point and shooting guards will take it for your team- they have the responsibilitry to dribble the bal past opponets and pass it to big guys or have a 3-point shoot. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Three_point_shoot.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  with that basic rules you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Practing: <br>  when you make your players practise- <br>  give a each player different training. like Point Guard practise him/her to dribble the ball- run fast with the ball.<br>  same with Shooting Guard but in different way, consentrate him on shots, thats why that positions is called shooting guard - shooting means he/she is one of the best shooters and guard means small guys.<br>  Small Forwards train them to pass ball.<br>  Power & Centre Forwards - train them to have lay-ups<br>  <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videosearch?hl=en&q=lay-ups%20training&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wv#" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.co.uk/videosearch?hl...</a> - look here they will show you what a lay-up is.|`|eWmv7Jujaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball</a>|`|C4jtzebDaa	Do not take 3 steps because its traveling and when u dribble and if u pick the ball up u have to pass it don dribble it because it will be double dribbling....

The issue with Rackers is that SF's Defense may be bad enough to only give up TDs, thus removing FG points for Rackers.  SF has Hill starting, and he was decent last year in limited play.  With SF's offensive weapons, they should be able to move the ball but may have difficulty in the red zone, thus limiting them to FG tries.  Nedney has the edge.|`|K4LiZrZ2aa	I would start Nedney.  Neither team's defense is all that good so there will probably be a lot of points scored.  Arizona is much better in the Red Zone so odds are SF will have to settle for field goals more often than AR.|`|GGvagInuaa	rackers

B07sKfdvaa	I think you have to go with Berrian here.  He had a bad week last week, but can give you 60yds and a TD with just one catch.<br>  <br>  Lance Moore could be a good option, as any receiver on New Orleans is.  But you can't count on him to be an option, especially with Colston back.  Look for Henderson to see more balls now that he's not the #1 receiver.<br>  <br>  Walter is also hit or miss.  I'd just stay away with Rosenfelds at QB, and Andre Johnson and Owen Daniels getting a lot of attention as well.<br>  <br>  Berrian seems to be the play here.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|NeYFiGmRaa	Lance Moore has the best matchup of the three.|`|5tuWA7S2aa	I would go with Lance Moore.

And it's kinda like asking, "Why do guys like fit girls instead of fat, disgusting slobs?"|`|AA10929376	Well,because I feel more protected and I like a guy who takes time to be determined to get those muscles hell i'm always determined to keep those abs.|`|f35a24bdab749816b16ae94701be3525aa	because lets me know that they can handle me. if you knowwhat I mean.

XgdaTGtoaa	Addai and Parker will be moved back into the offense with very limited roles. If Parker can catch a few breaks he should put up ok numbers, nothing worth starting however.

The game began on Saturday, April 18, 1981, and continued through the night and into Easter morning before finally being suspended. Although most leagues have a curfew rule that would have suspended the game, the rule book that the home-plate umpire had that night did not contain one. So the teams continued playing until the president of the league, Harold Cooper, was finally reached on the phone sometime after 3 a.m. Finally at 4:09, at the end of the 32nd inning, the game was stopped and would be resumed at a later date. At this point, there were 19 fans left in the seats, all of whom were given lifetime passes to McCoy Stadium. The game resumed on the evening of Tuesday, June 23, the next time the Red Wings were in town. A sellout crowd and news media from around the world were on hand, partly because the major leagues were on strike at the time. On that evening, it took just one inning and 18 minutes to settle the game, with Pawtucket's Dave Koza driving in Marty Barrett for the winning run in the bottom of the 33rd.|`|7bca92f0d61b563439fbe10954237e28aa	26 the brooklyn dodgers vs. boston braves    May 1, 1920    Game ended 1:1|`|AA10458918	it might be 26 or 32|`|7f39c3b8d67a35627790e2534e617a1faa	26 innings Brooklyn 1 at Boston 1, in 1920

Fans are oddly partly to blame for the morbidity of the entire issue.

PsCS0GK3aa	Same thing that happens every day:    Nothing...|`|SWkOC7rhaa	The game against West Ham proves why we really need Arshavin. We really need that spark. Someone who will attack INTO the defence. We have Rosicky who also does that pretty well be he won't be here for time so we really have to sign Arshavin.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Interesting. I wonder if Wenger really is completely ignoring the fact that he already has an abundance of talented attacking midfielders, or he just wants another one to add to the pile. I think it's a strange move to make when you have Samir Nasri in the team, Cesc Fabregas and Tomas Rosicky to come back, and the likes of Wilshere and Ramsey in reserve...when your team is obviously crying out for a holding midfielder. I would like to put that question to him.      Edit4: Out of your three most talented attacking midfielders, Samir Nasri is available.|`|LReOvHEdaa	@Zaana: YOu have being saying that for the past 2 weeks.. look where we are now...  Try something different...You say we wont get Arshavin..While I say your dialogue ..  @Roman: I am starting fresh ..  How many attacking mids do you think we have currently not injured..?  Edit:3 attacking mids?  Diaby Song Denilson Eboue Nasri  who do you think is attacking mid in here?  From my earlier post:  Vieira Petit Merson Platt Parlour - Good    Vieira Petit Overmars Parlour Ljungberg - Great    Vieira Gilberto Edu Pires Ljungberg Parlour - Great    Vieira Gilberto Pires Ljungberg Cesc - Great    Gilberto Cesc Ljungberg Gilberto Flamini - Good    Gilberto Cesc Diarra Hleb Gilberto Flamini Rosicky - Very Good    And now Cesc Diaby Song Denilson Eboue Nasri Rosicky - good enough    with Cesc, Rosicky and theo injured the midfield is left to :    Diaby Song Denilson Eboue Nasri - thats poor|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Hopefully we will sign him tomorrow.    lol Karthi:P  Ok. We won't sign Arshavin, no chance:(|`|58HL86ATaa	he might be stalling he desperate to go to barca|`|AA12370193	@ The Problem: pay attention to your "greatest midfield in the world" and the game tomoro before you judge what another team you obviously have not been watching needs.  You have basically judged Arsenal's needs based on what they have on paper, and not seen how they are actually working and performing in midfield. You do realize Nasri is playing wide left for us right? And he only went in the center today after the break, having Diaby and Denilson fall back, decreasing our width.        lol I love this trolling going on here, Karthi and I get 2 thumbs down for giving realistic assessments of our teams needs while Roman with his guesses gets two thumbs up. Bravo!  My apologies, Naffia members, for disagreeing with your Problem's godly remarks. My thumbs downs were well deserved for responding to his acknowledgments of complete insignificance. Only he knows what's important in this world!

jL775zZGaa	yes|`|4e4d8c05edb6613d08e7327f4eec50fcaa	I love the CFL.  It must be really sad for you going to high school and university games with the knowledge that you are lacking the insight and the intelligence to ever get there.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	I agree about the rules but the CFL is alright or how do the players make money?|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	The CFL was around,  and "running" the Canadian collages and universities, with its "pathetic" rules for years before the NFL was in existence.   In fact,  many of the rules for the American game came from the Canadian rules first (see 2 point conversion,  and yes,  it went to NCAA before NFL).    Its a different,  unique brand of football.   I would argue its better than NFL,  its players have to be more athletic,  versatile,  and not be stuck at one position.   You will never have a career long snapper or "special teams cover man"  up here (nor should you,  these aren't real football players),  and this adds an element not seen in a league of specialists.    Its a different type of football that is unique to Canada.   Would you object if they suddenly made every rink European sized and started calling games under the KHL rule book?|`|vuh0i3Axaa	i hate football in Canada, even i am a proud Canadian.|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	The AFL is better, even though the two sports are completely unrelated and nothing alike.

LGVrhTFTaa	I like your strategy,and I do the same thing..  I try to stack my team with BIGS+POINT GUARDS.  These players usually cover more categories more consistently then small forwards+shooting guards.(Last year I won my league with only 1 small forward,and 1 shooting guard,Joe Johnson+Melo.) So,I wouldn't have made that trade.But,it does seem that you needed Durants' scoring,so it wasn't terrible.  With CP3+Dwight Howard you have awesome cornerstones to build around,and barrage your opponents with rebounds,blocks,steals,and  assists..Just don't panic,and keep an eye out for players that are dumped due to injuries,or cold streaks,that could solidify your team.  (Gerald Wallace was just dumped in my league,and I'm watching his   injury updates very closely!)    ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|JQXCdGHYaa	The trade is good
AA10360729	In the U.S., it's called a trailer race. The object is to be the last driver to complete the predetermined number of laps. To continue to race you need to be pulling a "trailer".

It's a shame because his stats don't tell the full story. He is fairly inconsistent and takes most of his wickets from batsmen "gone fishin'". Test Player of the Year should undeniably be Katich. One Day Player of the Year will be hard to pick but I'd say Shaun Marsh or Johnson will pick that up. For State Player of the Year, I'd lean towards one of the Victorian batsmen possibly Rogers. Michael Dighton may also get a look in. Young Player of the Year is a tough one. Phil Hughes would be my pick for that. Finally, Female Player of the Year either Lisa Sthalekar or Elise Perry.|`|mkxGX2Rcaa	Simon Katich.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Johnson, he has the highest points average for a player and he is also very athletic runner.|`|cb9KqrUyaa	Mitchell Johnson is said to be number 1 in the running this year,he deserves it too.|`|gfxXikenaa	mitchell guy johnson i am very sure~  the guy got some potential among the other members of his losing side|`|378GRzrnaa	Its out of Johnson or M.Clarke
o2huwUpkaa	I highly doubt someone will think you look "wimpy" running on two broken toes and two twisted ankles.  That's not smart.  You'll heal in time (ask your doctor; no one here is qualified to tell you how long you have to wait), but don't hurt your recovery by trying to run.  Work something out with the coach, cross train (maybe), and start running again when you're not injured.|`|b3JKcQXGaa	I would say do not run!! Especially if your doctor said not to. Talk to your coach, and if he already knows you, maybe he'll let you get on the team anyways and then start up later when the doctor okays you. But speaking from experience as a former cross-country runner, don't run on injured ankles! It could injur them much more. Good luck!|`|0bzIkdyOaa	if you keep on running you might injure yourself to the point of never being able to run again and you should start running again when your Doctor says you have healed. As far a training for the Half marathon that is totally not a smart idea. As far as being wimpy looking wimpy for tryouts. Well if you run you might make it through tryouts, doubtful but maybe and then what good are you to the team when you have injured yourself to the point of being injured for the season.|`|D0ZRGRSRaa	dont run if you want to be in good shape for later on in the season. you can run again in about a month|`|qGXuQLWKaa	You can talk with the coach, see if you can try out later. Or, the best option would be wait a year. I know it'd be hard, but if you run now, you could cause permament damage, so there's no reason to risk it..|`|zSEyaCzCaa	Do not run. I know you want to run but if you start running when you are injured you will hurt yourself even more and that could ruin your future in running and can be more targeted for injuries.. I know you don't want to hear that but it's the truth|`|g8bjrbEbaa	run as fast you can in tryouts and then cut your ankles off then you should feel great. i promise, im the crazy wheelchair guy that lives on your street and im sexy or am i, leave me alone you crazy fool.|`|TMPoIvDSaa	WTF how do u sprain 2 ankles and 2 toes!!!!!!!

I had one touch my arm below the shoulder. It stung so bad that I ran out of the water. I later learned it was a Porchguse Man-o-war jelly fish. They have been known to cause death. I guess I was lucky.My arm was numb for about 9 months. It felt very much like an electrocution shock. It hits you with pain like someone dropped a train wheel across the stung part. I thing I'd rather get stung by a yellow jacket or get poison ivy. On a scale of 1 to 10 with ten being the most pain, that jelly fish sting felt like maybe 14 or 15. I should've went to a doctor. I didn't. I put Noxema cold cream on it for months.
ymdelC6Yaa	I think the question should be 'will Milan want him next season?'

Y4mz8BShaa	G&G is, overall, far better than CA. I would like to bring to attention that the internals of a stock Echo 1 G36C are far, far more reliable than that of CA's.    If the G&G is full metal, and has a polymer lower receiver, you can count on it being the same polymer used for the real steel. The CA likely has an ABS lower.    Care to link us to the rifle's you're looking at? ASGI doesn't have the G&G listed as having a non-metal lower, but, if I'm not mistaken, the actual M41 has a metal one.    EDIT: Yeah, polymer lower, but it will stand up just fine.|`|jEJxcWq5aa	Your going to have far superior craftsmanship with a G&G also... all the small things Chinese-made clones overlook (Yes CA is a Chinese clone, G&G is from Taiwan)  G&G has made a 360 with their internals (a few years back... their internals were faulty, at best), I now put them up in line, or close second to TM.  The ONLY thing I suggest replacing, if you decide to go with the G&G, is the wiring... G&G wiring seems to have high-flow, which means a shorter battery life...  Buy a set of low-resistance... & you will double your *gun's* life, & you will get quite a bit more out of your battery.  http://www.airsoftgi.com/advanced_search...

ZQCBqYTbaa	Hi Colette, I too would like to see Nori win a title, but im a big fan of Ben Spies, so like Wiggysan my money is going on him to win as a rookie. Im still not convinced the Yamaha is as qiuck as the Ducati yet. Shakey showing the way in testing.   But I think Ben (Elbowz) Spies is the next Valentino Rossi.|`|sTEb80tIaa	As a certain Mr Wiggysan predicted - my moneys on Johnathan Rea an the hubbys moneys on Nori Haga.

Are you talking about "gangster shooting", originally used with the Mauser C96 by the Chinese, and the term coined by the Japanese? The pistol is positioned sideways in front of you, and the recoil produced by firing the C96 multiple times creates a horizontal sweep of your arm, spanning the entire room until another clip needs to be fed into the pistol, or the magazine replaced. Faster then manual target acquisition using proper stance and iron sights, but is useless with modern firearms.|`|hvjWpq2naa	Idiocy? Dont stick a gun in your pants.

37evQRaDaa	Scabs are peal and stick tube patches.  You just remove your tube, find the hole and put a scab patch over it.  Then you pump it back up.      Make sure you pick up a spare tube because you're going to need it two days later when that scab lets loose, and the sticky crap won't come off the tube making it impossible to put a good patch on there.      If you want to carry patches around with you, get one of the old school ones with a little tube of rubber cement.  It doesn't take up much more room and the patches will last just about forever.  You can also patch your tire with a piece of an old tube and rubber cement.|`|ba005dfdcc32139a13ae1e054954f404aa	I use them and they work fine.

AA12325046	Wow tough fight!  I believe that in the early going Quartey would keep Tszyu off of him with his superior jab.  Tszyu would keep up the pressure and land some good shots especially to the body which would effectively slow down Quartey.  Finally in round 11, a visably tiring Quartey would get tagged by several big Tszyu right hand bombs and would go to the canvas for the 10 count.|`|78436eac48d3bdfc1a7f6a83734f199eaa	bazooka tko rd 11|`|sBdOzbx5aa	At 140lbs.

uXdx9vuBaa	i have boughten all my bikes in the united states and yes you have to pay duty on them mail or no mail b/c it has to go though customs.  Is there any way you can go to the states and smuggle it back into canada?  I live in a border city so im lucky.  I buy my bikes over in the states and then ride them out in the states. Once they look dirty and ridden, i just cross back over and tell the officer that i went riding to the parks.  i never have a problem.    It will be tough if you have to order a bike from the internet and wont shipping be alot?  If shpping is free, cool but yes you will have to pay duty on it unfortuantely. Im not sure how much but you can call and find out. there is a list of items.

Z8UV6S3baa	The answer depends entirely on what you are hunting with. If you are running an air rifle which reliably generates 15+ foot pounds of energy at the muzzle, then a Crow Magnum will typically still expand out to 40 yards or so, according to some different sources, as well as some experimenting I have done with my Webley Tomahawk, you need something like 6 - 8 foot pounds of energy to get them to expand.    So if you are running something in the 12 foot pounds of energy range, like an R11, or an R9 then I'd be more inclined to use the Silver Arrows unless you are running inside of 30 yards for your shots.    Personally, I'm not a huge fan of pointed pellets except in low powered air rifles and would suggest you look at some of the domed, my favorite being the Crossman Premiers, Webley Lazapels and the JSB Exacts for higher power or the express for a lower powered gun.    I'm assuming you have sorted out your skill with the air rifle for making humane shots, and have sorted out the laws in your locale for doing your rabbit hunting.     Thinkingblade|`|km9cQNAXaa	I have to disagree with Chuck.    Unless your an expert marksman then air weapons are at best marginal on any thing bigger than rats. I'm a firm believer in humane kills.     Best thing I can say on air weapons is that they don't blow holes in the barn when you shoot the rat.    Ian M|`|RX5t6x6Haa	doesnt really matter, as long as you have a decent gun they'll both work wanders,     just a personal note: i've already killed a rabbit with head shot at 45 yards using crossman premier hollow points with a 1000fps .177 pellet gun    EDIT; some people will come on here and sware that a 22LR is the way to go, but those are just the people that have never shot a high powered pelllet gun before    EDIT: or you'll get some PETA FRECKS saying how bad it is to hunt, all i got to say is RABBITS MAKE GREAT STEW!!!      EDIT:         IAN M-  shoot a high powered adult air rifle once, not all air rifles are like the red ryders, there some pellet guns out there that have BEEN PROVEN to KILL  mountian goats, and when your blowing stright though  a 4x6 and a 2x4 at 50 yards, i'm pretty sure that its a little over kill on rats, I've already got INSTANT KILLS on ground hogs/ woodchucks at over 100 yards with a high powered pellet gun|`|4mb6xaxBaa	if they are accurate in your gun, they are both good rounds and ive killed bunnies with both.|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	A - Always use the pellet your rifle is most accurate with    B - Domed pellets are "generally" the best for hunting, since they retain velocity better and therefore deliver more energy at impact than other pellet shapes    C - You're going to have to have a very powerful rifle to push .22 caliber 18.2gr Beeman Crow-Magnum pellets at what IMO is an optimum velocity(around 900fps).....A MV of 900fps gives you a very flat trajectory and an inherently accurate rifle/pellet combination.....You would need a 20.0fpe rifle to push that pellet at even 700fps....    I don't know what rifle you have, or other factors, I'm only trying to make a point....>A rifle/pellet combination that gives you a poor trajectory makes it difficult to hunt effectively and humanely.... IMO, it's not fair to the game we hunt. You can't afford to be off by even an inch in your hold over/under let alone 2 or more....    Could it be done, you bet, it becomes much more difficult though....If you're the kind of person that puts 100 or more rounds through your rifle each day, and knows to within 1/4in your hold over/under at every range out to the effective limits of your rifle, then you could do it.....|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	bunnies are very thin skinned  i have used both with the same result  dead bunny and one shot kills  which ever is the most accurate in your gun will be more of a concern for you so that you can place the pellet where you want it every time.|`|2KcmVTycaa	You shouldnt hunt rabbit at all.

05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	at close range it seems any pellet will do on small birds.  when the ranges increase as well as the size of bird ( pigeons , crows etc ) i prefer to use a pointed pellet such as RWS superpoint or Beeman silver sting. Predator  brand also works well.  flat tip or hollow point pellets seem to pack the feathers up thus cushioning and decreasing penetration.  a pointed pellet separates the feathers as it goes through them allowing for penetration and vital organ hits  there are other brands out there but these are some that i have used with good luck|`|AA11694178	You do know it is illegal to shoot any bird except those designated as pests with a rifle of any kind.  Birds designated as pests can be hunted and shot with whatever you want.  If you make the mistake of shooting a songbird or a migratory game bird with a pellet rifle and get caught, you are in DEEP poo poo.|`|RX5t6x6Haa	all you need its a high powered airgun, no kind of special pellets, just a pellet gun thats shooting over 800fps|`|s4xDhjrVaa	Break Barrel.

Yg1QR4mmaa	My favorite is Wanderlei Silva, a bomber who is all heart. You have to see his fights in Pride to see him at his best. He is a Pipino Cuevas like puncher who was always coming forward and throwing a high volume.|`|R0J1W3BCaa	Rampage Jackson I like him because of his knockout ability and his personalty. He brings a lot of style and charisma to MMA which you don't see very much. A lot of MMA fighters don't really have a personally IMO if you ever watch their Countdown shows. Its the same boring I train hard then I fight hard. No trash talk no I'm going to knock you out sucka.     Matt Hughes I my other favorite MMA fighter because I like watching him wrestle and slam guys. Its cool to see somebody my height and weight fighting.

I used to watch a lot of old UFC's and I have seen some Pride FC. My two favorites would be Dan Severn from the old UFC. He had resilience. After getting crushed by Ken Shamrock in UFC VI he came back and won the eight man tournament among UFC elite beating Tank Abbott and Oleg Taktarov to capture the UFC championship crown. Another fighter I like is Carlos Newton. Although a .500 fighter he has fought some of the best in the MMA business: Renzo Gracie, Matt Hughes, Pat Militech and Anderson Silva. He is a great fighter, no doubt, and if he fights again I will get a front row ticket.
ffh5mTViaa	Gsp has raised his game immensely since their first match, which he still won despite the bad first round. His wrestling allowed him to control the fight on the ground.      GSP dominated Matt Hughes,Matt Serra and John Fitch since then. BJ has beaten Jens Pulver,Joe Stevenson and Sean Sherk. I give a slight edge to GSP in the quality of his opponents if you throw out Pulver and Serra.       GSP has the Greg Jackson camp, with far superior training partners. You can't despute this. BJ has....his bro and a bunch of guys without the credentials of the Jackson camp.      So....BJ still has the striking advantage with his fists at least. GSP has the cardio and much improved wrestling. BJ is BJ and still won't train as hard as he should. GSP can decide if he wants to take things to the ground. BJ's JJ wasn't a factor last time and I don't see it happening now. Sooooo.....GSP dominates Penn on the ground, wears out BJ, TKO 2nd round....one order of humble pie and side of crow for Baby J. GSP vs the Spider anyone??|`|4JQUUrX1aa	im taking st pierre with a tko :) for no other reason than his energy and youth.|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	Im not sure who im choosing but I see what your getting at.

Rough up the back side of the tip just a little bit too, then make sure both of those surfaces are clean. Apply the cement and clamp it. I usually leave it overnight, but it depends on the cement.

pLlZXEe1aa	A bunch of places:    1. there are lots of good books. look on Amazon or check out your local library    2. Park Tools runs classes on this stuff through your LBS. Check here to find where they are being run near you:  http://www.parktool.com/clinics_training...    3. try sheldonbrown.com. this is the best website for biking in my opinion, especially if you have an older bike.    good luck |`|mC6FzaAAaa	Start with the small things.    When some adjustments need to be made, get it done at your LBS & watch them do them if possible. While you are there,  ask a few question on technique.  They usually don't mind, espicially when the shop is quiet.    I'm a fairly slow learner when it comes to mechanical stuff, but my LBS has been really helpful. I've asked them quite a few questions - some a bit simple or silly, but I have to learn the stuff somehow.    And go to the library & get out a bike mechanic book. When you feel a bit more confident about your skills, it's time to try to do more wrenching by yourself. If in doubt, get your LBS or a fellow cyclist who's good at mechanical stuff, to check over your work.    Tools aren't expensive when brought gradually.  Buy them when you require them, and you can become quite self-sufficient over-time    And there are sources on the web - some have already been listed, but there are others like bikeforums, in which you can get advice from other cyclists.    Happy riding|`|NcwD9XSHaa	Go to the library, sign up for a card, take out bike repair books.  If you take something apart and have a problem, THEN ask the bike shop mechanic.  You will need to collect a bunch of specialty bike repair tools and get a mediun size plastic tool box for now.  Learn simple adjustments and repairs, especially fixing flats.  Then start your own little repair business and use the profits to buy more tools and a work stand.  Everyone has bike with flat tires sitting in the garage.  Oh, you will need an air pump too.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	For video the Bicycle Tutor is a great site.    Sheldon Brown has a very informative site.    Bike Repair on line is also good.

I'll go out on a limb and say,yes, get the license.  After all, I don't know the penalty for poaching over there, but it's probably pretty severe.  Good luck.

abBCyJhFaa	heyy, :D so i am crazyyy about softball its my life! i love it soo much :) so i am going to tell u some basic tips you need to know. one thing im going to tell u first is that try to be as least nerves as possible while trying out because the more tense you are the worse you will do. So just relax and have fun!  ok so here are some tips you should know about softball...    Catching:  Number one thing you need to know is don't be affraid of the ball, it really doesn't hurt. Keep your eye on the ball, and watch it go into your glove, it's the best way to explain this. One thing that also might be great value to help is that, you might want to get a higher quality glove, they break in a little quicker, and they reduce stinging. You are supposed to catch/field the ball in the pocket, but sometimes at full run, the ball doesn't always go right in the pocket, as an outfielder, I know this from experience, which is why you would probably like to have a higher quality glove. I suggest getting a Worth Libery Advanced, or the Nokona.    Batting:  Ok well batting is kinda hard to explain but ill try my best.   make sure that you have the right bat for you, length and weight.   Well start in batting position. So stand there with your feet shoulder width apart, and bend your knees a little. Then hold your bat up behind your head, be sure that you are not sticking your back elbow up.  Next trigger, when the pitcher starts her motion, which means lift your foot up, and set it back down, the trigger allows you to get the timing of the pitcher down. Then once you are sure that the ball is a strike and is hittable, swing at it. I can't really explain proper swing at this point, because I would probably need to show you in order to give you acurite results, so I'll just say to make your swing go from low to high, and follow through, when you are done with your swing, make sure that the bat is behind you, and your back shoulder replaces where your front shoulder was when you began the swing.   There is also different things you can do for batting like:  Bunting  and  Slapbunting (dont feel like getting to into this sorry.)    Sliding:   sliding is another very (important to know) This also goes back to if you are a fast runner, if you are fast, your coach might have you stealing bases, and every single stolen base, you either need to dive, or slide, sliding is where you are running as hard as you can, and all of a sudden you just kind of let your feet go under you, and you slide on the ground, make sure that one of your legs, it doesn't matter which one, is tucked underneath the other one, and the other leg is facing straight forward, your legs will look kind of like the letter 4. I reccomend getting a sliding pad for your knee, to keep your knee from getting cut up, and getting sliding shorts, for your upper thigh.     These are most of the basic things you need to know about softball and thats just what you need to know about it.    now for what u can do to make u better is you need to work out on ur arms for throwing and a little bit on your legs for running. Go to batting cages for your hitting and do aot of running around so you dont get out of breath while running the bases but you dont need to focus on that too much but you need to work on it if ur not a good runner. AND REALLY WORK OUT AND WORK ON EVERYTHING AND DONT PUT IT OFF TILL THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS TILL TRYOUTS.  hope you do well during tryouts :D|`|qrVkcgduaa	I would suggest working on your forearms and hands,you can control the bat better if they're strong,also run with resistance,like a weighted sled (get creative).You might want to ask one of the players if they can throw with you,or throw you bp.Good luck|`|h44jLxa9aa	GO TO EVERY WORKOUT!!! the coaches want to see that u are dedicated and really want to play. if u show that u are willing to be devoted and get better u will have a great shot at making the team. i play baseball for my high school and my freshman year thats what i did and now im a junior and have made the team every year.  also make friends with and upperclassman and let her help u out.|`|3sxK2xQKaa	Workout your wrists and forearms for bat speed, legs and hips for power and most of all run a lot.

WrDGhduxaa	a good time would be about 3:10, give or take a little.  The best way to run any middle distance race is to run each 200 at the same speed, this makes you look like you are speeding up the last 200 because most guys are slowing down.  In doors is tricky because it is difficult to stay out of trouble since the straights are very short, so it feels like you are running on the curve all of the time.  If you can lead and set the pace you usually feel better than following and trying to pass.   Sometimes the early pace is too fast so you need to let them go away and hope they will come back, but even if they don't if you run your best you will still have a better time than if you had gone out too fast.  It is important to know the pace so you don't go out too fast or too slow.|`|KBjleE6qaa	depends on your age. a 2:30 800 time is about average for a 9th or 10th grader. the beast way to run a 100 is to concentrate completely on your start and make sure you accelerate as fast as you can, get to your top speed asap, and keep it right through the finish line. in the 200 concentrate less on your start and speeding up because once you reach your top speed, its only a few seconds before your body automatically slows down. therefore, u should try to speed up fast but just don't think about it at all and you'll naturally speed up at a slower rate which in the long run will help your race.

Xn7c8hZaaa	would be great. torre loves him . he will be with the dodgers. baseball headline all year. it is just manny being manny. joe will be talking to the press. needs zimmer or stengal for press meetings.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Dude, Albert Pujols isn't the owner of the Cardinals so he can't make that decision, and to answer your question, no he isn't because they said they don't want him.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Albert Pujlos....

Peace!|`|ak5A435maa	first of all, "will Manny Ramirez might go to the Cardinals?" doesn't make any sense. second of all, Pujols will NOT make the dicision.  he cant! its not his job! the general manager makes the dicision. and no, the GM doesnt have any interest in him. so go learn something about baseball, and tell your friend that too|`|8OUegINnaa	........|.....  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  VROOM!!!!!!!!!|`|cOLbrnLTaa	just a rumor!|`|6JSIWnooaa	Noo, he won't go on the cardinals. He will most likely stay in Los Angelos or end up in a Yankees or Mets uniform.|`|o9VwzG0qaa	While fat Albert would love to have manny as protection it's never going to happen as long as he's on a pathetic small market team. If wants a team that is going to provide him with other all-star quality players he's gonna have to find a new team in a bigger errrrrrrrrr real city.|`|5eqnQm5Raa	Possibly,  Albert Pujols is trying to get the team to agree to sign him. I'm not entirely sure, but Manny might be a bit to pricey.|`|Z8sQF0dAaa	I doubt it, the Cardinals have a glut of outfielders. Still, a lineup with Pujols and Manny back to back would be scary for pitchers.|`|Uathep5Yaa	Pujols and Ramirez hitting 3-4 = 09 World Series Champs    Cheap Owners = No Playoffs again|`|5ZVOeMo9aa	No Manny needs money. Cards have none. If Pujols wants him there so bad HE should take a pay cut!

7h0qfos1aa	Nice
DWtWLlqkaa	His big mouth and horrendous coverage skills are his flaws    Hall is supposedly the fastest (or one of the fastest) players in the NFL, yet last year Terrell Owens, a receiver known much more for his strength than his speed, burned him twice for touchdowns, including a long one on a go route where Hall should have been able to use his supposed speed to catch up to T.O.    Also, his big mouth gets him way overconfident. He talks big and goes to Pro Bowls, so he thinks that he can cover anyone. But he CAN'T! Look at games last year where he played "elite" receivers.     Week 15 against the Dallas Cowboys: DeAngelo Hall spent the whole game covering Terrell Owens. Owens finished the game with 5 catches for 69 yards and 2(!!!) touchdowns, including a 51 yarder. Not a great game for Hall.    Week 8 against the Cincinnatti Bengals: Hall spends the game covering Chad Johnson. Johnson has 6 catches for 78 yards and a touchdown, including a 20 yard catch.    Week 2 against the Buccaneers: Hall cover Joey Galloway, a receiver well into his 30s. Hall gives up not touchdowns, but allows Galloway to have a ridiculous 9 catches for 161 yards, despite having the passes thrown to him by Chris Simms, who is injured.    Week 7: Hall has one of his worst games of the season against Pittsburgh. He spends the game covering receiver Hines Ward. Ward has an incredible 8 catches for 171 yards and 3 (!!!) touchdowns, despite having backup QB throwing passes to him for half of the game.    Week 9: Hall covers Detroit receiver Roy Williams. Williams winds up having a field day, catching 6 passes for 138 yards and a touchdown.    Week 13 against Washington: Washington's QB for this game is Jason Campbell, and this is only the 3rd start of his ENTIRE career. Yet his main receiver, Santana Moss, who is  being covered by Hall, still manages to have 7 catches for 123 yards and a touchdown.    There were a few others, but I did not feel like listing them all. And when you check the stat page of NFL.com for interceptions, Hall is not listed in the top 30. There are several SAFETIES who had more INTs than he did last season. My question is, why does everyone think Hall is great when he can obviously cover no one and does not create a lot of turnovers. Also, several of the above receivers caught passes for gains over 40 yards! Any corner back who gives up this many pass plays over 40 yards to receivers CANNOT claim to be the fastest player in the NFL or the best corner back. In my corner back rankings, Hall is not even a top 15. And you can see why.      For the person who said that Hall is similar to Deion Sanders, you are an IDIOT and must not have seen any of these several games in which he was burned so badly. Champ Bailey is much more like Sanders than Hall will ever be.|`|bJoM2mfWaa	i think hes more worried about being the fastest rather than learning to cover guys.........    his technique is flawed and he bites way too much going for the interception........    plus, hes just never had great instincts.........    great cornerbacks have great instincts, they can just tell what route the receiver is  running and where the ball is gonna be|`|1SI1ZLidaa	He does not really have any other than he is very short for a CB.|`|TSEqHvS4aa	chocalate? idon't know, i give up.|`|5f72456c41b82b255f56533a0a73200eaa	His inability to lockdown a receiver. He's too inconsistent against receivers but it cannot be all his fault all the time. Atlanta's secondary has been horrible before he joined the team.|`|wOnOuwDkaa	He gets cocky at times.    And he gets burned from a reciever at the time he souldn't.|`|Pi9o699taa	Too aggressive at some points leading to big plays, he also gets cocky and loses focus at points.|`|vuazdOR3aa	he loses focus and makes mental mistakes. i remember one game against the saints he couldve knocked the ball down and the game wouldve went to halftime, but he went for the pick and the receiver scored. and T.O. scored like 3 times on him. he makes nice Ints but he just needs to ply smarter|`|x7CX6Zcpaa	I think his main problem is trying too hard to get an interception instead of covering his receiver. he gets burned alot on account of this.|`|62rsXxRaaa	Deangelo is one of the best cover corners in the league whether your a Falcon fan or not. He's one of the fastest men in the league and could actually play offensive wr also. The only weakness he has shown is himself at times. His ego has gotten the best of him and he has been known to take a play off from time to time. But he would immediately improve any defensive backfield instantly. He's about as close to a Deion Sanders as you can get this day and time, but he can tackle and will turn the lights out if a receiver isn't careful. He's a great special teams guy too. Just needs to stay healthy  and keep his ego in-check.
2Bgrunp1aa	the list could go on for days....Mike Bibby out of Arizona, Steve Nash out of Santa Clara, Jason Williams and JJ Reddick from Duke, Kirk Hinrich from Kansas, and TJ Ford from Texas all had awesome careers in college and the NCAA's (and how good could Stephon Marbury have been if he didn't leave Georgia Tech after his freshman year?), but you got to go with Hurley. He led one of the best squads of all time to 3 straight final fours from '90-'92 and would have made it four but in '93 lost to a great Cal squad led by Jason Kidd. Hurley also has those back to back championships with one having him Tourney MVP. I'd say Bobby Hurley for best point gaurd since 1990.|`|ys3DHzDuaa	I'm gonna go with Bobby Hurley out of Duke.    He stayed all 4 years from 89-93 and became the NCAA all-time assists leader.  He also led the Blue Devils to back-to back national championships and earned the Final Four MVP honors in 1992.      To lead the NCAA in assists should automatically bring your name up as one of the best, if not best point guards.  Throw in the 2 championships and i think he makes a strong argument.|`|d4de0f6319d50289597e0652190f04bcaa	Lee Humpfrey   Florida Gators !|`|IKOX5bbEaa	Best Point Guard, Probably would either be JJ redick, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash.... Probably redick because he was from duke and is the all time ncaa three point leader... but i would also argue for nash, hill, and bibby|`|DSadHqy4aa	Tyler Hansbourhboro cause hes from UNC tarheels|`|AA11743561	Okay first of all you dipshits he/she said POINT GUARD not shooting guard or powerforward. I would have you say bob hurley would be up there also jason kidd

AA11729094	The Remington 870 HD will chamber 3" or 2 3/4" inch shells.    Your best bet for a defensive shell would be 2 3/4"  4 shot. For good premium ammunition, expect to pay anywhere from .75 cents a shell, to a dollar a shell. They come in boxes of 5 and 25.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	You need practice, and lots of it.  For practice, you want to shoot the cheapest stuff you can find, right.  I shoot lots of the cheap walmart 12 gauge shells.  They are just 2 3/4" shells with 7 or 8 shot.  You can get a box of 100 for $23.  You never even mentioned using the gun for self defense, but if that's an issue, I'd opt for 2 3/4"  4 buckshot.  If you are using it for deer, go with a slug.  That remington will digest a whole slough of different shells.  But for now, I'd get as much practice with the cheap walmart shells as I could afford.  As you branch into different things, you may need to adapt your ammo some.  Whether it's skeet shooting, varmint control, self defense, or even big/small game hunting, your Remington is up to it all with a simple ammo swap.|`|dpSr0icwaa	your gun will be able to handle 2 3/4th or 3 inch shells.    3 inch shells will kick more and reduce the overall capacity of your firearm by 1.    The two most common choices for home defense by those knowledgable in shotguns are  4 buckshot or 00 buckshot.    do not confuse  4 buckshot with  4 birdshot.    Buckshot will be sold in boxes of 5 shells each.|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	If you will spend about the same amount of time reading the imprint on the barrel as you did asking this question, you would know the answer. It states very plainly on the barrel the guage and chamber length.  Also, you should know to read the owner's manual that came with it.
XIkL2GmXaa	If at all possible you should find a store that sells climbing gear and try on as many pairs of shoes as you can. Fit is a very personal thing and everyone's feet are different, what works for one person may be awful for another. In my experience sizes also vary greatly by manufacturer. Find what works for you and stick with it. That being said I love my Mammut Samurai's.|`|EoPRTJr4aa	the best shoes are the ones that fit your feet and that you can wear without having to come down off of climbs and rip your shoes off cuz they "are killing your feet".......|`|eEhG1aSWaa	I would go with the fivetens or la sportivas like suggested by the other users, but its what you like.|`|alVxhLy3aa	anything fiveten should be great. my faves are the ANASAZI's. they are amazing. my friend also really liked the JET7's but they are really aggressive, if thats what you want.  but fiveten is the best. i jumped shoe companies for about 4 years, but im never leaving fiveten now.|`|Ajky5WsEaa	like the other answers, see which fits you perfectly and feels right. for me red chili sausilitos are the best ive had so far and they definately are quality in my opinion.|`|qDE5fS3Zaa	I have a narrow foot and my favorite is the La Sportiva Miura VS (Velcro).

Nadal had a very long semi final again'st Fernando Verdasco and hasn't had as much time to recover as Federer has. Roger beat Roddick in 3 sets 24 hours earlier than Nadal's semi and it took Nadal 5 hours to win his 5 set semi thriller.    But Federer to win! =D|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Rafa will be able to recover fine from the semifinal and he'll be the champion after 4 sets.    VAMOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|B8Gwxo1laa	I like and respect both of these fine players, but as there has to be a winner, I'm picking Federer. I believe his desire to prove himself to all those who claimed that at No. 2 in the world he was washed up is pretty strong. Also, the sentimental part of me would like to see him win a few more slams and beat Sampras' record in style. Nadal, young and with an incredible future ahead of him, won't be far behind. That's my perfect scenario--who knows. I'm just glad to be a tennis fan.|`|oGNeNlpnaa	Roger Federer with in 3 sets
zgMIfM8waa	ahaaha,  at firstt i didn't get it either.  but; anna was actually the one who burned down the house accidently.  the fire killed her sister anna & her mother,  so the whole time she was actually imagining alex beingg there.  & to come to think of it, the only person in the movie who actually had a direct conversation with alex, was annie.  annie supposedly didn't want to remember the accident that she caused; so she researched the father's girlfriend, who was known as "rachel summers" and got the name "mildred kemp." &annie came up with all these ideas about rachel.  on the other hand, matt; annie's friend, knew about the fire. annie was scared he may tell, so she dropped him in the river, killing him.  so, at the end of the movie the girl from across the hall closes the door with a name tag that says "mildred kemp."  so annie actually got all these assumptions about the girlfriend from the girl across the hall, & she basically got all crazy and decided to kill the girlfriend.  hoped that helpedd ? (:|`|6OAxXpTjaa	Anna was CRAZY.  She killed her mom, sister, boyfriend, and her dad's girlfriend.  She remembers everything again at the end, and  that she was imaging everything the whole time.

LIKkt8djaa	The manual is mainly a jib board so in saying that it's a very soft board and most people downsize on those type of boards, both go against what you want in a powder board, If it had some type of reverse camber design than it would probably still perform decently in the powder but since it is without one it'll be far from a powder board.    If you're looking for a park board that can still perform decently in the powder and around the mountain than look for one with a reverse camber design and even saying that you wont want to go ultra short, you'll want to go a little longer than what you might normally want to ride for park to compensate for mountain riding.    Some boards I would look at.    FREESTYLE/ALL AROUND ORIENTED RIDES    Never Summer SL-R  Libtech Skate Banana  GNU Street - another board I ride and do ride everywhere a bit stiffer than the capita.  Burton Hero  Capita Horrorscope - softest of the bunch but I still ride this thing everywhere and it performs admirably  Omatic Awesome

Personally I've always had a favorite and that's my prerogative and it's alway's been a brewery sponsored driver, just not Budweiser.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I spent 4 years not having a favorite driver. I felt kinda left out not having one. Everyone I knew got all excited to cheer for their one favorite driver, and there I was just there to watch.     It's cool that you don't want to pick a favorite. Someone's got to be here to remind us that having one favorite leaves us susceptible to hurt feelings.|`|mTGEeCHaaa	I didn't have any trouble picking Terry Labonte as my favorite.  But since he's semi-retired, I keep trying to find just one guy to replace him.  Can't do it.  So I mostly cheer for the Chevy drivers.  Glad to have Smoke back where he belongs this season.  (Dodge boys are okay, too.  lol)  Truth be told, I like all the drivers, too.  Even Rowdy.  When I'm in a really good mood.|`|a4LWildhaa	Since Earnhardt Sr died, very hard. Always have followed Kenseth and McMurray, Terry LaBonte was always a favorite.|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	I was a Darrell Waltrip and Dale Sr fan for years.After D.W. retired and Dale expired I went a couple of years before I settled with Tony.He reminded me of drivers from the 60's and 70's.His style on the track made me think of the classic stock car racers.So I started to pull for him and since '03 I've been a fan of Tony.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	Its just you|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	Not me .. I have been a jeff Gordon fan since his sprint car days. Even when he drove the Ford Baby Ruth car.. I was really happy when  it move over to HMS   which uses Chevy's being i am a chevy person .He would be going for his 7 title if nascar had not change  the point system to the chase format .Which i hate because it is not fair.  I leans to teams who are better on the 1.5 mile tracks over the short tracks and road courses.Also only give credit in the for of points for wins and erases any point lead the teams might have made by finishing strong inthe first 26  races however did not win. A driver could finish 2nd in the all of the first 26 races. yet mean nothing when the chase started.  how is that fair?|`|mIdcJEJNaa	NASCAR is not really an either, or type sport..  You may, or may not have a favorite, but there  will always be some you like more than others, and   some you hate for a while, and then change your mind   about as you get older, and they get older as well..  You may dislike a drivers personality, but find that  over time you really admire his driving skill...  NASCAR doesn't "play" just two teams at a time,  so this can even change race, to race...|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Nope, always been a Earnhardt fan, Sr and Jr, no problem for me at all, I also like most Chevy drivers.    Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Well I had a favorite driver and all the rest came in second...then he passed away and my fanship went to his son but then I had a second favorite one to watch and all the rest came in third...then I lost some respect that had nothing to do with his driving abilities and  2 became my  1 and there is stays...I do have a top 5 but it changes....and so I have one favorite that I route for but all the rest pretty much come in second.  I enjoy watching them all.  I chose a driver just to keep an eye on his racing...thats just the way it worked out.  Watching one driver in particular. I like them all for one thing or another.|`|cKl8ZSrSaa	But but but my parents did pick a favorite out of one of their children.         But not really ( I think )|`|RLQdhFWXaa	I never had a problem picking my driver, knew right off the bat when i first seen him drive.   And if he does somehow is not able to finish the race I have Tony Stewart who I also root for.|`|LNTWvVuqaa	I used to only watch open wheel, but, when they broke up...I wasn't sure about it anymore. I thought I'd go with CART as they had the "bigger" names. But, then Smoke showed up in the IRL and I just started likin' him. I followed him here...and the rest(as they say) is history.  I always said "I'm not a NASCAR fan, I'm a Smoke fan," and figured I'd stop watchin' after he retired...probably go back to open wheel. Now that he's an owner...I may be around even after he's done drivin'?|`|PGlZn1wEaa	You just get wiser when you get older Fluff.  I like several drivers.

29b63369675d1ab4a94cab2caf776a0caa	Defense is the key to winning games. You must be very and very light on your feet. Defense is like a chess match, you want to think a few steps ahead. Even though your opponent has the ball, the defender has the power to force the opponent where to go, when to pass and when to shoot. When people try to drive on you, keep your hands STRAIGHT up and put a body on your openent. once again, be light on your feet. Also, try trapping opponents against the boundry lines to put more pressure. If you know your opponent feels only comfortable driving right, literally INVITE them to go left so that they have to take a uncomfortable shot.  Whenever i played a basketball game, i pride myself on defending the best scorer big or small. The first rule that i made for myself is that i would smother my opponent defensively BEFORE they get the ball. If your defense can prevent my opponent to even get the ball, then i have won.

My coaches call me the "defensive gem" because I'm so good at defending. When the rebound comes, just push the other girl back with your butt and box out. If you are a guard, run in for the rebound. Don't be afraid of fouling out. Your coaches will then know what to teach you in practice, like how to take a charge. Stand perfectly still, hands straight up and let her run you over. You can't do anything about them calling the fouls on you, but make a noise when your pushed like ahh or oww. You'll be a great basketball player if you tell your coaches the issues you have with playing the game. They can work with you one on one.|`|4725ba51f79f53272ee35c0ba5f795beaa	Make smart & quick moves on defense, only reach for the ball if ur sure u wont foul.

cbd2ad98d17f395b0bbb67011ca6b660aa	hola todo sobre definicion de gym    ?Qu es la gimnasia?   La gimnasia es la actividad consistente en ejercicios o movimientos metdicos del cuerpo, que se practica por higiene o por deporte. Est claro que el deporte que nos interesa abarca una enorme cantidad de aspectos y de conceptos que se escapan completamente en la definicin expuesta, por lo tanto, si queremos profundizar apenas un poquito ms, podemos aceptar como bueno lo siguiente:     La gimnasia es una combinacin de ejercicios que exigen del gimnasta unas condiciones fsicas excepcionales. Estos ejercicios se realizan con la ayuda de aparatos. En las competiciones oficiales se exigen seis ejercicios libres en la categora masculina y cuatro en la categora femenina.     Categora masculina: los aparatos que se utilizan son: barra fija, barras paralelas, potro (ejercicio de salto), caballo con arcos, anillas y ejercicios en el suelo.  Categora femenina: ejercicios en el suelo, potro (salto), barra de equilibrio y barras asimtricas.      --------------------------------------...    Las competiciones oficiales       La competicin oficial ms importante de todas es, sin duda, los Juegos Olmpicos. Ganar los Juegos Olmpicos es el gran sue?o de cualquier gimnasta de elite. Inmediatamente despus vienen los campeonatos del Mundo. En Europa, los campeonatos de Europa son, obviamente, lo siguiente a ganar. El equivalente para otros continentes (Juegos Asiticos, Juegos Panamericanos, etc.) Tambin hay muchas competiciones internacionales de exhibicin que los gimnastas suelen usar como preparacin, que estn muy bien consideradas. Algunos ejemplos son la ''American Cup'' en Estados Unidos o la ''Chunichi Cup'' en Japn.         Las competiciones suelen tener tres modalidades:     - competicin individual  - competicin por equipos   - competicin individual por aparatos.      --------------------------------------...    Un poco de historia     La gimnasia ha formado parte del programa deportivo de los Juegos Olmpicos de la era moderna desde que stos empezaron en 1896. En aquellos juegos (slo competan hombres) los gimnastas alemanes consiguieron la totalidad de las medallas. Entonces slo cinco pases llevaron gimnastas a la competicin. Adems en aquel tiempo los ejercicios a realizar eran gimnsticos (en caballo con arcos, paralelas, anillas, etc.) y atlticos (correr, levantamiento de pesas, salto de altura, etc.). Las competiciones atlticas fueron suprimidas en los Juegos Olmpicos de 1936 y la ltima vez que se pudieron ver fue en los campeonatos del Mundo de 1954.     La primera gran competicin gimnstica que se hizo fuera de unos Juegos Olmpicos fueron los que hoy en da se consideran los primeros campeonatos del mundo de este deporte que tuvieron lugar en 1903 en Antwerp (Blgica).     La base de la gimnasia artstica moderna qued fijada en los Juegos Olmpicos de 1924 en Pars. Fue entonces cuando se incluy por primera vez el programa de competicin que hoy en da reconocemos, es decir, competiciones por aparatos, individuales y por equipos.     El debut de las mujeres en la gimnasia tuvo lugar en los Juegos Olmpicos de 1928. El equipo ganador en aquella ocasin fue Holanda. La competicin individual femenina comenz en el a?o 1952. La gimnasta ms condecorada de la historia (incluyendo ambas categoras, femenina y masculina) es la sovitica Larisa Latynina, que lleg a ganar dieciocho medallas olmpicas incluyendo nueve medallas de oro entre los a?os 1956 y 1964. Inmediatamente despus de Latynina podemos situar a la legendaria gimnasta checoslovaca Vera Caslavska.     Hoy en da la gimnasia es uno de los deportes ms emblemticos del programa deportivo olmpico junto con el atletismo y la natacin, teniendo un gran poder de convocatoria y siendo de siempre uno de los deportes ms espectaculares y mticos.           --------------------------------------...    Aparatos de la competicin masculina     Suelo: Durante un ejercicio de suelo, toda el rea del aparato debe ser cubierta por el gimnasta. El ejercicio consta principalmente de tres a cinco diagonales (series acrobticas realizadas a lo largo de una diagonal del suelo) llevadas a cabo en diferentes direcciones. Estas series acrobticas deben ser realizadas incluyendo, al menos, una hacia adelante y otra hacia atrs (estacionando el cuerpo hacia afuera o hacia adentro).   Los elementos de transicin (movimientos gimnsticos que se realizan entre las diagonales) deben ser ejecutados con el ritmo y la armona apropiados.   Los mejores gimnastas harn de tres a cinco diagonales de una importante dificultad, realizando dobles mortales con giros en la segunda o la tercera.   El rea del aparato comprende 12 por 12 metros.    Caballo con arcos: El gimnasta debe cubrir con su ejercicio las tres reas del potro, el medio y ambos extremos, mientras realiza continuos movimientos circulares interrumpidos slo por las requeridas tijeras. Las nicas partes del cuerpo que pueden tocar el aparato son las manos. El ejercicio entero debe fluir con un ritmo controlado y constante. Considerado por muchos como el ms difcil de todos los aparatos en categora masculina, el caballo con arcos es tambin el ms sutil. Cada movimiento est definido por unos complejos posicionamientos de las manos y el cuerpo.       La dificultad radica en dos aspectos. Primero, el gimnasta realiza movimientos que son predominantemente llevados a cabo de forma circular en un plano horizontal. Segundo, el gimnasta hace la mayora de cada rutina apoyado en una mano mientras la otra alcanza la otra parte del aparato para realizar el siguiente elemento.       El caballo con arcos m|`|f36560f7edcf7538ea0b8ca25e5448d4aa	Prueba estos links:    http://usuarios.lycos.es/deportetotal/Ed...  http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimnasia    Espero que te sirva    ?Salu2!|`|Ml0Hhw7kaa	Por definicin, la Gimnasia General es una modalidad de fundamento no competitivo que busca la salud y participacin de todo aquel que se sienta atrado por el movimiento fsico y que conforma un grupo, que se presenta y acta con una creativa y particular expresin gimnstica buscando resaltar los aspectos culturales y sociales de su regin.|`|Wdh6dpVwaa	Aca esta joya....    http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimnasia    Saludos|`|0oGO8Goxaa	La verdad no entiendo mucho tu exposicin...  pero si te refieres a un circuito de gimnasia; pues te aconsejo el spining, step, aerobic... todo esto suele durar unos 45 o 50 minutos|`|UJamP9Y7aa	prueba en wikipedia XD|`|uS6rq4Akaa	La gimnasia es un deporte en el que se ejecutan secuencias de movimientos que requieren fuerza, flexibilidad y agilidad.

I stay with them through thick and thin as do MOST people who are avid fans. I believe everyone has a right to pull for anyone they want. BUT to call anyone who likes the Red Sox lately a bandwagon fan has become very offensive to me. I was born and bred a Red Sox fan even though I am from North Carolina. I have followed the Sox since the time I had the attention span to do so, but when i announce that I am a sox fan its always oh yeah it figures, or since when?, or something of that nature. Now this year the Rays have had a very good team, amazing in fact worst to first is quite an accomplishment, but to walk around campus and hear RED SOX SUCK GO RAYS has become VERY popular. I just want to say that there is a difference in fans and bandwagoners. the Red Sox have a major league record in the number of consecutive sellouts, the Rays could barely get 5,000 to their games THIS YEAR. so for any Rays fan to tell me they are more of a fan is ridiculous and in fact for any Rays fan to call a yankees fan out is even more ridiculous. They Yanks and the Sox are fans, though we may hate each other we more often have reasons to hate each other(Damon, Boone, and of course THE BAMBINO).

Chicago Cubs: I went to the States as a foreign exchange student and studied there my last year of high school, the state I lived in is Iowa which has a AAA team the Iowa Cubs, and it belongs to the Chicago Cubs organization. And also I need to add, before that experience as an exchange student loved Sammy Sosa and lot of the baseball players who had played there.

First TV in the neighborhood brought us the Yankees almost all of the time during World Series times.  The very first time I watched them was in 1956, Don Larsen pitching the perfect game.  Later followed them and got hooked on Mickey Mantle.  My son's middle name is Mantle.  Other is named after Billy Martin and my daughter would have been Dimaggio if a boy.

8skV9ze9aa	Yeah, it sucks, but the O's will finish 4th. They'll finish at or a little below .500. Izturis is a great fielder but an offensive liability. Roberts will turn in his usual fantastic year, Markakis will improve upon '08, Adam Jones will improve but I don't think he'll break out in a huge way (think .280 AVG, 22 HR, 15 SB), Huff will do well but not as well as '08, and Mora/Scott will turn in solid but unspectacular seasons. I hope Zaun gets displaced by Wieters soon, because Wieters can flat out PLAY. He has the potential to be one of the best catchers in MLB history.     The pitching, though....the pitching will suck. Bad. Guthrie is the staff ace (no better than a  3 on almost any other team), Uehara is the  2 or  3, and the rest is an absolute mess, with Danys freakin' Baez getting a shot for the rotation. There's good news on the horizon, with Chris Tillman, Brian Matusz, and Jake Arrieta due to reach the majors sometime in '09 or '10 we can actually safely foresee a time when the O's rotation will allow them to compete in the AL East.|`|BPQlKk5eaa	they goin DOWWWWNNNN|`|3QELIOU7aa	They are gonna win it all.|`|ak5A435maa	hahahahaha! is this a joke?

Perhaps 75-77 wins at the most. But anything is possible, remember what Tampa did.|`|ImiNOEZaaa	Since when is a guy who posts a 600 OPS an all star/unstoppable force? Izturis is a stopgap, nothing else. Uehara is a major wild card, likely projection puts him as a  4 pitcher. Orioles will be in dead last. The only bright light will be watching the rise of Wieters.|`|Z8sQF0dAaa	They have a good minor league system, but although Cesar is a former all-star, he is just an average player. Because the division will be so tough, they'll probably finish last, but look out for Matt Wieters, he's a great hitter. He'll make a big impact.|`|gmvusL2gaa	They're in the same division as the Yankees, Red Sox, and Rays. If there's one team in baseball this year that I would bet my life's savings on to not make the playoffs, it would be the Orioles.
XUUDRM7yaa	The dish of a wheel is simply making sure that the rim is exactly centered between the dropouts/frame.   In a rear wheel, there is a lot of dish beause you have to make room for the gears.  In a front wheel, things are usually symmetrical (no dish), although some disc brake hubs may have a small amount.   To do it, you really should have a dishing guage tool at the minimum, but a truing stand is also helpful (and some of them can be used to achieve the same results without the dishing gauge).   I wouldn't go fooling around with dishing unless you already know the details of truing a wheel and proper spoke tensions, but it's simply a matter of loosening all of the nipples on one side of the wheel and/or tightening all of the nipples on the other side in order to shift the rim in the direction you want it to go.  If you get the dish too far off kilter, you may have problems with alignment (very noticeable if you try to ride no-handed) or with the tire rubbing the chainstays.  Poorly dished wheels won't give you any drivetrain problems, though, because the hub is still fixed in the same position in the frame no matter where the rim is at.      Re-spacing, if I'm guessing you correctly, is altering the position of the rear axle within the hub.....people do that a lot when making singlespeed/fixed gear conversions.  You basically are shifting around any axle spacers and the position of the bearing cones/locknuts to move the hub left or right and help achieve a better chainline.  By itself or in combination with adjustments to the front end of the drivetrain, you can usually get a great chainline without too much trouble.      Hope this helps......if you need more just post up again.  :o)|`|JSGLKnA4aa	redish is to recenter rim to hub. respacing not sure i'd have to see.

oidfmtnYaa	uhh I don't think it's that simple    You can have skinny legs and be the best in the state.    You can also have skinny legs and be one of the worst runners ever.     Less weight, without the cost of muscle, can benefit you in distance events, but its only one factor. A 5'9, 120 pound distance runner can easily get owned by a 5'9 145 pound distance runner. My point is that there are MANY factors that can determine how fast you run, and those factors vary depending on the distance your talking about.    If you are a long distance runner, your body, may naturally develop skinner legs. Your muscle fibers develop more for distance running and you require less muscular power and rely more on pure endurance and running efficiency. But then if you go and competed against guys in the 1500m or 800m who have "jacked" thighs and quads, you would probably get owned because you are lacking the power and speed needed for those distances that would come from having more muscular legs.     But you could also compete against a guy in the 800 who is very muscular, but lacks endurance almost completely. In this case you would probably beat him based on your excellent endurance. (the 800m is about 60% aerobic and 40% anaerobic).     Now if that same muscular 800m runner had at least decent endurance/distance ability he could beat you.     In conclusion, just having "skinny legs" doesn't necessarily  mean you will be successful at any distance. Many factors play a role in you overall speed at that distance and those factors depend on the distance. Naturally, one can not posses enough muscle power with "skinny legs" to be a 100-400m sprinter. (I would think)    The person's legs might just seem skinny because they are tall as well. You should think twice about this.|`|vkhQz16Laa	How skinny your legs are have nothing to do with your speed. It's all about you. You can have really mucular legs and be fast. You can have skinny legs and also be fast.|`|7oSATkyQaa	I don't think speed would be determined by how thin you are, but how much energy you have.|`|4RyOFhMlaa	Skinny doesn't really have to do with it.

FYd1ndVxaa	Do u know how many unforced errors had Nadal made when he played Verdasco? In that match alone, how many unforced errors had Nadal made in each set? How about in his previous rounds' matches? Nadal is careful. But he is making winners too. Just that Verdasco was too on fire and aggressive to make 95 winners over Nadal. That's why he looks like he was beaten that many times! Federer is definitely amazing and I believe he will be the usual him when he meets Nadal, playing with accurate winners' instinct with the best shot-making ability displayed, but look at Nadal, will he ever not to put any effort to win his 1st hard court and 6th Grand Slam titles? He has played Federer as many as 18 times! Both understand one another pretty well. Nadal is always that tenacious. Mentally, he is nowhere worse than Federer. Despite possibly being worn out by his semifinal match epic five-setter which lasted 5hr14min, he still has more than one day to recuperate himself, even if not to its fullest energy restoration. He will never give Federer an easy way. So will Federer. Serena is right. Who doesn't want to win a Grand Slam? Who will win? I will never know until the championship point is won! So I guess will anyone else. I'm glad that the two meet again in this, I must say, giant final encounter. Good luck and all the best to both. I hope and believe that the final match quality will not lose to the enthralling epic Verdasco-Nadal semifinal match.

If we get the inconsistent Federer that makes too many unforced errors, it'll be Rafa's title. I hope Fed can do it.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	The thing is that Rafa knows how to play Fed. Besides he'll have somewhat of an edge physically because not only he's had a whole extra day to recover, *his* SF match wasn't nearly as draining as Rafa's was, but mentally the Spaniard is always a few steps ahead. I get that right now Fed is being considered the favorite, but it's based basically on the fact that Fed played for a couple of hours on Thursday while Rafa played a 314-minute epic a day later and I still expect him to recover fine and be the champion in 4 sets.|`|NdTy3twjaa	Yes because he dominates the hard courts, Rafa or not Federer will play brilliantly.|`|sptrtwxlaa	nope.

QtjnmEzoaa	E. Manning is far more overrated. Ben's strength isn't in his passing stats (though occasionally he's known to have some great ones) His strength is in extending the play and throwing on the move, as well as using his size to his advantage, none of which are strengths of Eli's. Roethlisberger may not be the best pocket passer, but he's a great overall QB, regardless of the status of his running game. I agree that the defense does carry the team though during some games. Again, he doesn't have the best stamina as far as throwing time and time again, but he's a great fit for the Steelers overall scheme in that he keeps the offense moving, he makes smart decisions, and he's more than capable of extending a play. To sum that up, I wouldn't call him elite, but I don't think anyone else does either. I think he's thought of as very good, which is not overrated at all. Well deserved, in fact.    BQ: I almost wish the Cowboys had been in the playoffs since watching Romo choke is so much fun.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Eli is more overrated.

It is you that needs to make the classes exciting by pushing the kids. 25 push ups? That is nothing. Entering a tournament? What does that have to do with your classes? Leading the class through Kata? Not unless they are really good at the Kata.    I would recommend that you make classes harder, faster paced and this way the kids will leave your school with the feeling of accomplishment like they do my three schools.    In terms of making a poster or ideas to promote your school...well that would be the first reason why I would pull my kid out of your school. That is your job. If the parents / students love the training and are growing through what you offer they should refer people to you all the time like they do at our schools. Do not push students to promote your school or waste time they should be learning martial arts to make posters and what not.|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	I think you could do it.

uc2jjgXVaa	Hey, I'm a CAM too.  Generally, the main job of a CAM is to be the connection and the passage between all the different positions. So, you basically have to be one of the, if not the most, passing player on the team. Distributing the ball is key to your position.     So first of all,being able to pass the ball accurately to your players is a very important thing to develop. If you have a person to practice with, pass the ball at a range of distances. At longer ranges, pass on the ground and in the air. Long through passes are a frequent thing as well as lobs over the top. When you get to the short distances, practice one-touch passing. At times, give and go's are perfect for the situation. Also, one-touch passing is great when you're very closely marked. So, with one-touch passing, you act as a wall and you make your defender useless.    Now, if you look at the different ways you receive the ball. Primarily, when your goalie takes goal-kicks. Most of the time, the ball drops in midifield. Therefore, repeatedly head the ball when you can. Your head can also be a passing option: so, one-touch heading to your teammate is great. The good thing about heading is that is some places, kids can be quite afraid of heading the ball. Thus, when opposing team players see you head the ball, it almost establishes you as someone of a higher caliber. Plus it makes you look good to coaches. When wingers cross the ball, sneaking into the penalty box late causes no one to pick you up and mark you. Unmarked headers = goals.    Next, you get passes on the ground from your defenders. With the ball, you have minimal time before someone comes to get it away from you. So, you need to turn with the ball first time. Close control is crucially important. The best thing to do when practicing by yourself is juggling the ball. It teaches you exactly how much strength and power to put into controlling balls of different heights and speeds and how to pass it on first-time as well. (Remember to develop your control with your chest as well) If you have someone else to practice with, then once again, passing from different distances is not only fun but very productive. Remember that passes can come from any angle and where you want to subsequently pass the ball to can be at any angle as well.    To figure out where the best place to pass the ball to, you need to look up when you have the ball. So, practice moving with the ball with your head up. In terms of passing, simply kicking the ball to another player is fine. But to make the most of your passing, you want to generally penetrate the other defense with the ball as much as possible. Through Passes. Difference is, a pass is simply between two players. A through pass is between two players but a defender gets taken out in the process. Here's an example: http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=mWAxwA8Ov4...  Remember that when making through passes, you pass into space for a player to run to and not right to his/ her feet. Vision to make the best passes possible is something to aim to develop.    Last of all, shooting. Practice shooting on an open goal or with a goalie. Free kicks and shooting a moving ball. Also, volleys. If you look up Paul Scholes from Manchester United on Youtube, you will see how, at corner kicks, he stands at the top of the penalty box waiting for any rebounds. If a rebound does come, he either takes a touch and fires or he hits it first-time in the air. It looks spectacular. Finally, remember that you run a lot. So go run!     Have Fun Practicing!|`|1XEUETPKaa	I'm a forward, but all I can say for CAM's are think of yourself as a forward, but you go farther back into your half of the field when your team is on defense (ex.: forwards hang around the midline or circle, you go back farther than them, like in between the circle and the top of your box).    for numbers: 8 (Steven Gerrard of Liverpool and Frank Lampard of Chelsea), 10 (Mikel Arteta of Everton), 20 (Deco of Chelsea), or 19 or 25 (CAM numbers on my squad)|`|idT8xm0taa	-stretch  -do some quick sprints  -juggle the ball around  -do zig-zags wit cones    notin too tough cuz u might get injured. jus things 2 get warmed up and be ready.    jersey number: 10, 9, 12, or 20|`|gbFwoOtTaa	always be looking to move forward and attack, like another forward but a little behind them. look to play out wide to open up the middle of the ground for u to recieve a cross and score!!  as for the jersey get a 9 or a 10|`|wJV4aBEvaa	Just watch games and Observe what the professionals do.

rNUyV1EYaa	They last won a playoff game on Dec. 28, 1996, 40-15 over the Vikings.    They have since lost six playoff games.    However, I like to throw out the years 2000-2004 because they had some crap quarterbacks like Quincy Carter, Chad Hutchinson, Vinny Testaverde, Drew Bledsoe, Drew Henson, and other washouts.    I have to admit, it was more fun listening to the jealously and hate when they were good.

I have checked all of them and one or two are just so poor quality that you may as well squint your eyes to make it focus.  The others are delayed, which mean you can't watch it until after the fight is over, usually 12hrs later.  And finally the rest just want to add new members to their message boards.
LCzOoo6Aaa	well... seems to me like u can be either middle hitter or setter  if ur middle, u r going to need to hustle a lot  but ull get ur fair share of hits too, especially if ur the best hitter and most athletic on ur team. plus, since ur a great blocker, it wud seem like a fitting position for u  if u were to play setter, it wud make such a difference  a setter that cud block and hit wud be so great  u can make things a little bit more complicated but more efficient by having two setters  wen ur in the front row, u can be mainly a middle hitter or outside hitter or opposite, whichever u and ur coach decide  and then wen u r in backrow, u can be the setter  the good thing about having two setters is that u always know that one setter is going to get the ball  again more complicated, but more efficient, u guys will need lots of communication  ur a good all around player, if i were ur coach, i wud put u as setter  ur such a rarity...|`|DeRRNCvnaa	I would suggest playing YOUR favorite position. It sound to me like Middle Front would be good. You could be the back-up setter also, in case of something happens to your setter or she cannot get to the ball on time.|`|6205283364bce5bf761e31dbab2a3426aa	Try Middle Hitter!!!  &&  its Libero lol =]|`|c7J5otJIaa	id say Strong Side hitter  or Middle Blocker.|`|O1ZCb90Jaa	You should play middle. You're pretty tall so you could probably get a lot of blocks and spikes in that position. And since you got a nice arm for hitting you could do backrow hitting pretty well too. And chances are it would make it over if your arm is as good as you said it was.  So definatly middle for you.|`|t2bMd6TVaa	Middle Blocker, for sure.  And by the way, it's spelled libero =)|`|VIqVwBVMaa	You sound to me like a middle hitter.|`|eYYahbsNaa	sounds to me like you should be a middle hitter as long as you have the speed to get to a low set ball. the middle is normally one of the tallest girls who can jump high and hit the ball well. Are you a good blocker? if not that could be part of why coach doesn't have you play middle, since middle hitter also has to help with all blocks.|`|nm81INKmaa	i think you should be an outside hitter!!!!! i am an outside hitter on my 12 year old travel team. it is so much fun because you get the ball alot.|`|SqtxI1uhaa	Well you have the height for a front row player can set and block. Right side is the best position for you because you can do all of those things. They block the majority of the time because outside is set the most. Sice you can set you make a great back-up setter and you can hit; which always comes in handy when your setter has to move the ball around.|`|6l2zoZm5aa	i think u should stay right side. you'll block the most in high school. and hitting gets better with practice. if u need tips on it just ask... i was one of the best hitters at my school even tho i was frosh.|`|4d5JnwKvaa	I would have you as the middle hitter.  Even if you are not that fast, at 5'9 to 5'11, the coach should be willing to change the defensive strategy some.  The only reason I would have you at right-side is if you were left-handed, but since it was your weakest side of hitting, that doesn't sound likely.  Being a setter, in my opinion, especially if you continue to grow, would be problematic later on when you get to high school and college.  So, overall I would say middle hitter.|`|DPsumKlFaa	setter, at your age and height|`|b5zOVw3jaa	Okay:  You sound like me, I play middle hitter but i can also set. Since you're so tall I think you should play it and let the shorter people set. Because you are a hitter DON'T PLAY LIBERO. The libero is not aloud to attack, serve, or set in front of the ten foot line. Blocking is something a middle hitter does a lot and since you're good at it....

I also dislike his patience and I don't think he has enough ambition to manage a club with such a potential.|`|KasfoGILaa	With the amount of class players and cash they've spent you'd think they would be performing much better!

They know how to hit sixes but don't know how to spend time at wicket and score 70s and 80s which is very important when you're playing against a good team.    Their bowlers will trouble the Aussie batting but their batting will disappoint their fans as usual and they will be thrashed by the Aussies.    3-2 to Australia i predict    Edit-  NZ won the first match but i was right, they were almost as bad as the Aussies today.|`|hecLfcedaa	Ha ha. No I DON'T think NZ is gonna beat Australia. I mean losing to the South Africans was embarassing but we're still a world-class team and chances are pretty high that Australia's gonna win.  Sorry.

I am sure you would be hurt if someone said that about you.....so stop doing that to other people...|`|RW7qVMk5aa	hell no, i think hes going to be great, the nat's are gonna be awesome this year(im being 100% serious) they just need one of the dunn/hudson choices and theyll be awesome with a way upgraded pitching staff led by olsen (who can be an ace when hes on his stuff and healthy). and an amazing outfield with atleast 2 20/20+ players      Have you looked at their lineup?  And dont go by dueks and milledge's batting averages, they both turned it on in the second half and latter parts of the season, do u have a problem with their staff this year? really?    Olsen's stuff IS great, he just ran into arm problems last year and couldnt even break above 85 for like a month(where usually hes around 93~94~) they've got 2 great pitchers and 2 decent ones on their staff, Dont sleep on guzman(anymore),Never sleep on their outfield now, and like i said before, if they can add hudson or dunn along with zimmerman. They can contend in the no-very-strong, East.     The Braves have regressed. not improved. the phillies are going to revert back to nothing. and it will be a 3 horse race with the marlins, mets, and nationals, im not talking out of my ***, i pay attention to baseball|`|c3tADklmaa	He has the potential who can hit .280 and 35 HRs, but just like Bradley's attitude.|`|AA12374240	from what i've read in the papers, he has serious emotional problems that havent been addressed. playing baseball is hard enough without being burdened with additional baggage. if he can get help and get past his mental issues, he would be a force on the field for his team.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Some guys just never play like they are expected.    Alex, even if the Nats make a turn around can they really compete with the Phillies and Mets? The Braves are trying to improve and the Marlins always seem to do battle. I would think the Nationals wouldn't be that good because Olsen's stuff isn't as great as you think it is.|`|NsYIUu3caa	it's up to E.D. to determine what kind of player he'll be.    everyone hatin on Alex, think about this... who thought the Rays would make the W.

kGXU1Dotaa	Tex,,now don't get me wrong Fielder is awesome,in fact on the MLB network it was reported Fielder wanted to be a yankee BC of course his dad played with the yankees.But after we signed Tex is hopes were diminished aside from his weight i still belive he will excell and become great player.|`|L77OlY1naa	Honestly Prince Tex is a Yankee now.If your willing to sign for a team for money and not try and be an individual and make a good teeam better you dont belong on my team.Prince stayed where he is because he is a team player he can replace Delgado anytime he wants.His dad was pretty fun to watch it was like watchin a offensive linemen play baseball.He was the first to break 50 with no ROIDS|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Fielder has good power, but he doesn't run well nor does he play defense that well. I'm going to have to go with Tex.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Prince Fielder    I think Tex is highly overrated...|`|36zm5zK8aa	fielder|`|AA12374240	tex, he's a switch hitter with good power and an above average fielder (no pun intended). fielder has power but unless he hits it out of the park, his speed makes him a liability in a close game. im hoping he'll have a better work and team ethic than his father did.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Teixeira. Despite the fact that he usually gets of to a poor start each year he is a better all around player. At the plate he makes contact, whereas Fielder strikes out too much. Teixeira is a more prove commodity, and thus a better player.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	mark teixeria|`|RW7qVMk5aa	Teix, Switch hitter. Fielder's gone veg and wont touch the near 50 home runs he had in 07|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	No way Fielder is not even close to the athlete Teixiera is. I would take Texiera over fielder anyday. Fielder is a tub of lard who can hit the long ball.|`|fKlZdoPHaa	Teixeira    He is a better hitter. He is a better defender and a better runner.     Fielder batted .276, which is not too bad, but not that good either. Tex batted .358 in LA. His career stats are better than Prince's as well.|`|VghVdPfsaa	Tex mostly because he is a better fielder. The only issue with Tex is that he is a slow starter; but once he gets rolling, he can hit.     They both have about equal hitting power (discouting Prince's monster 50 HR year in 2007). Tex, though, hits for a little higher BA, OBP and SLG percentages. He's also a little faster.    Prince is good, though, and I wouldn't mind having either.|`|XxG9SqYoaa	Mark|`|8skV9ze9aa	Players like Fielder (read: fatties) absolutely don't age well. Guys like Mo Vaughn, Albert Belle, and Prince's own father Cecil Fielder, all with Prince's body type dropped off the map in their early 30s. They either got injured or saw their production and skill rapidly deteriorate. If we're talking for the next 4-5 years, I say Fielder, but Teixeira's career pattern of continued health (save for that isolated, non-recurring injury in '07) and body type tell me that he'll be productive at a high level a bit longer than Fielder despite being 4 years older.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Teixeria for sure, faster, more athletic and can hit. Might not have as much power as Fielder but I really think the better player is Teixeria.|`|dmci2TKBaa	Mark Teixeria, no contest.  The problem with your assessment, "Prince Fielder will eventually be a better player," is that you ignore that fact that Fielder is a rather fat man.  Big men just don't last long in pro sports.  Unless Fielder loses a great deal of weight (which may in turn cause him to lose power), he will never be as good as Teixeria.|`|J8Vb0aYLaa	your analysis is very naive and childish. you assume that Fielder will develop, while indirectly assuming that Teixeira will either remain the same, or will decline. based on your faulty analysis and perhaps, your anti-yankee bias, you conclude that Prince will be better.     Almost everyone disagrees with you. I don't need to add anything.    as for Mets____0, Prince and the Brewers could not come up with a long term contract, so he ended up getting $670K for one year. He said that he was not happy about it. then in 09, he was seeking arbitration. to think that he would not follow the money is childish. MLBPA wants you to seek the best deal for yourself, to set the market. Nobody really sacrifices money.    first to break 50 with no roids?     A-Rod has hit 50+ homeruns 3 times, and he did it way before Fielder. He never did roids either.   Read much? Luckily, not all Mets fans are as foolish as you.|`|v9bTfQGMaa	Tex!|`|A7gYMzXbaa	Prince Fielder he is so young and will be able to surpass Mark's dreams.|`|qRpIScbfaa	I find it funny that a Mets criticizes a team for paying alot of money to get a player...Mets spend a ridicolous amount of money.  Mark Teixeria is the clear answer. Defense - gold glove, Offense - could contend for the triple crown someday.  Fielder will not because of his K's and Contact rate, however, you couldn't go wrong with either.|`|yJ8DqPA0aa	Mark Teixeria all around player.|`|eP0KkYR3aa	tex come on u just saying that b/c you r a mets fan and hate the yankees fielder i would take in a pie eating contest.|`|MjZ1Pvydaa	Easy, Teixeira. He hits for a higher average and is a gold glover. Fielder has a little more power but teixeira is a better all round player.|`|2c6e6cd9b5b5a01b8b5dce3b7354987aaa	They both have the same power, so I give it to Texiera because he is a Gold Glove 1st baseman.|`|lp4wajLxaa	Tex hands down, no second thought.  He's a MUCH better fielder and he while both are equal in power Tex has a better bat and can actually run around the bases.  Fielder is nothing more than a giant blob.  He's the fattest vegan I've ever seen.|`|iwn3zXDTaa	Tex
iQvkT8Doaa	That is all total bullsh*t. Mark I can understand your and his frustration, just look at the 1st paragraph, childish. How can an Arsenal fan say that ? Even if finish 7th and end up winning nothing I d never go against Wenger, this is the same AW that took us to the CL final, won the double, etc. Its just his way of doing this just ain't working for us.    BACK IN THE DAY WE HAD PLAYERS WHO GAVE 110% FOR THE BLOODY RED AND WHITE SHIRT, tell me HENRY, PIRES, VIEIRA, LJUNGBERG, ETC    Now Song, Denilson, Bendtner go missing when we want them to show what they can do.  Thats the difference from the 03-04 Untouchables and this, also age is not an excuse. Even the greats make mistakes and Wenger has made MANY over the past 2-3 years.    "Maybe people should stay away from a game or two to SHOW their displeasure at the state of affairs"    Damn what an idiot. I've seen some hilarious pieces written about us and this one just tops em all.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	5th place and you plan boycott of games?    Im sorry but it's too much. Read my answer to ur Q in Fifa section.    Milan came 5th last season and we didn't get in the CL... if all us Milan fans cried, tried to find a head on a pike, etc, etc what does that show?    Im sorry but whilst I understand Arsenal fan's anger, I find it over the top. You're only what, 4 or 5 points away from CL spot?    Responsibility in a club, like any company or management, begins at top. With the owners and the board, down to the coach, the preparation staff and then the players. Even the fans play a role in that.    You can say whatever you want about Wenger but it's not solely him...|`|LReOvHEdaa	This is from one of the blogs:  I am just sooo fed up. I really have reached the point where I cant be anymore pissed off.    Look at Tottenham (not at their league position) but they are able to spend money and they are not going bankrupt are they? How many players have they bought in this window?    I know that wenger is right that its not sustainable to keep buying every transfer window. But we are talking about buying the odd quality player to strengthen our team. We are not saying do a Man City or Chelsea? We are not even saying to do a Man Utd and spend 30 million on one player.    I think to myself do I deserve this? I put all that time and effort to support my club and where is all of my money going? I would live with it if it went towards buying some good players and they flopped and we won nothing. But I cannot live with it when its going into the fat pockets of the board members and we miss out on title just because we were short on 1 quality player. That makes me feel used. It makes me feel being taken for granted. It makes me feel that the board members are insulting my intelligence by thinking I am too dumb to figure it out.    Hence I will not be renewing my season ticket. Enough is enough.|`|M0gdrhB2aa	i agree with marco^^^^    not going to games..won't really help he situation at all..perhaps only make it worse..whoever wrote this..did it out of anger and frustration..not logical thinking..|`|583630813856412488308836bad3d46caa	I am really fed up with this too.  But to tell you the truth we don't really need to buy 1 million players in the window, we only need 1 or 2 but those players have to be the right ones that can change our situation around! For example look a tottenham they bought like 10 players but have'nt done ****! And eventually all the inured players will come back!|`|GjpWEu6Raa	HAY MARK    can you e-mail that bloke/woman and ask them to REALLY say how they feel     5 YEARS HAHAHA as you know im a villa fan and have had to put up with worse then this over the years     Mr Ellis not spending out of principal because it came out of his own pocket is one thing and it kept us in the black when the leeds/Forests were falling down the leagues is one point      28 years for a trophy is another if i stopped watching villa after 5 years of nothing id have stopped in 1987 !

You gotta believe that they'll win something.|`|InCpu9Vfaa	no I dont    you're being way too pessimistic    you gotta believe thats what makes you a fan    we're 10 points behind top spot    there are still about 30 points to be played|`|373267de54a567ce4fdd303d84705891aa	another lame glory hunting idiot..i really wish theyd go and support chelsea. So no i dont agree.|`|XzhjWTA2aa	Arsenal and Wenger have been plagued by the injury bug.  Fabregas being the obvious example, but eduardo, rosicky, wallcot, they are all game changing players that can be shuffled in and out of a line-up to allow for optimal game day strength.  Imagine Fabregas and nasri at CM and rosicky, and wallcot teasing opposing players on the flanks.  For the most part i think Wenger has done well with make shift squads.  Arsenal made a mistake in letting flamini move to milan, as they are in desperate need of a holding CDM, but i think they can shore this position up during the summer transfer period.  Toure is solid as a central defender it would be nice to see a hard man next to him someone that strikers would dread playing against, and also with some height.  cliche and sagna are arguably the two best outside backs in the EPL and i'm still not ready to throw eboue under the bus.  when fit and playing with confidence he is brilliant.  up front arsenal is loaded with talent, persie, eduardo, edabayor, bendtner, thats not to shabby.  I would like to see arsenal sign arshavin, playmakers of his caliber are not a dime a dozen, i believe he would fit into the arsenal system straight away.  Even at 15 million thats a bargain in todays market, if a punk like bellamy is getting 12 million arshavin is indeed worth 15.  i think the arsenal ship is treading water but we are not yet sunk.  chin up and lets grab that 4th champions league spot.  go gunners.|`|zJCWIWE0aa	Words cant describe how angry i feel at wenger.

I agree that Wenger's big plan to dominate the world of football with bunch of kids didn't go to his plan but people are forgetting that his best players are injured or out of form, if Rosicky, Eduardo, Walcott were there and if Adebayor was in last season's form things would be much different right now, RVP showed once again how talented he is and if he wasn't injured ever three months he would be one of the best EPL players right now.... but the luck wasn't on Wenger's side and he didn't have plan B!!!!    I remember last season with Barca when everyone were saying how overrated Barca, now when Barca had only ONE serious injury so far (Iniesta) things are very different..... with almost the same squad as last season!!!

1d4Vin3Waa	I like the new system they have out that lets you set out clay pigeons on holder stands and hangers. Not sure who makes them, but you hit an orange clay and you get immediate feedback. You can use them at almost any distance for pistol and rifle. I've seen them at Walmart, but haven't gotten it. I use the "Shoot "n" See" targets for initial sighting in to make sure I'm close and then I'll get more precise targets for adjustments.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	I use steel plates ---- You can here the bullet hit these even with your ear plugs on.... When you hit them you can also see them swing from there chains.... Paper targets are lame -- all that walking back and forth to check shot groups.....

Similar to what this guy is doing.....    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4SVwSGPL...|`|YbXSNgUOaa	Just for fun and practice, I set up gallon jugs of water at 300 meters.Easy to tell when you hit them. Have fun while we can.|`|kY3uuTq9aa	They sell targets that have a bright green base paint with a black coat on top with the standard red rings. When you shoot it the black chips away and it exposes the green, This way you can see where you hit at long distances.|`|VP48PjM9aa	Typically when I shoot targets with my rifles it is at 100 yards.  The ones I like are made by Champion (it is called the Leupold 100 yard target).  I like these because the background is made of one inch squares.  It makes adjusting the scope a piece of cake.  The bulls eye has a one inch circle around it, I like to place day-glow orange adhesive circles in the very center for contrast.  The paper is very heavy and attaches to our target boards with staples easily.  These rock.|`|HdJpc3QDaa	Like Really long range? If I'm target practicing at 500 meters or over, I but a 12 pack of cokes and a can of Blaze orange spray-paint.    Spray-paint the cans and set them on a stump or wooden fence post. The orange you should be able to see and if you hit one you will know it because it will blow up in a huge spray of coke and hop about 6 feet in the air.    Have fun and BE CAREFUL of what is down range from you.
tazUGumXaa	Absolutely not. In Texas you can legally carry them in your car (as well it should be). In Texas you can actually carry a rifle or shotgun in plain sight on public property (with the obvious exceptions - court house, school grounds, etc...)    And, we need to do all we can to keep it that way.    Intelligent, vigilant, honorable and armed men created and crafted our nation. If any of those four ingredients dissappear so will we.    Be safe, responsible and enjoy your purchase often.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Are you joking? In Texas?     Of course not.

If you are 21, not a felon, meet other simple requirements and have proper ID, you can buy a gun.  No license is required unless it is a restricted gun such as a machine gun or a gun with a silencer.|`|kY3uuTq9aa	No, I live in Houston Texas and bought many guns from academy. The only thing you need is a ID, Be 21, and not be a felon.And I think if you have previously been a felon they wont let you get one. And if you buy a firearm they may make you wait a couple days for processing depending where you are.|`|TBAfpnmgaa	No license necessary. You can buy guns from sporting goods stores, gun stores, pawn shops, or gun shows, and all you need to fo is show an ID and fill out a short form. The seller contacts the state and does a quick background check and if you don't have a criminal background or history of mental issues, you just pay the bill and walk out. If you buy from an individual, you don't even have to do that. I recently bought a rifle from a county sheriff (his personal gun, not one he confiscated), and the time from I walked in his house until I walked out with my new gun was less than 2 minutes.   Isn't freedom wonderful?|`|lT8MEI6Raa	Not yet. If HR45 passes in the House of Reps you will need a firearms license to own any gun anywhere in the US.

In Northern Virginia, where I now live, (30 miles from DC), you can still get them from ads in the country papers in the rural parts of the state.  Obama & his cronies may try to change that, but with 200,000,000 of us gun toters, (some of which still stick to our religion), that genie's out of the bottle, & I for 1, don't plan on helping make it any easier to cram it back   in !

rFtMatOaaa	first you need to get a skatebord you shoud have a look in second hand stroes for a cheap one or if any of you frends have old one ask them if you can borrow it to learn.    first you should find i good place to skate in you local area like a skate park or at the back of a shoping centre some were close and with a large area of concreat and no to many rocks or stickes on the ground.    learn how to ride it first, just get on it and push with one foot and go along with it  get the hang of it and then try to go a bit faster.  once you think you can ride it and turn anroung dorners and balence try to do some basic trickes like olies or manuls    onece you are confident with rideing the board you mite want to upgrade. you can buy a full kit  with the the components of the skate board in one or you can buy each peice by them selves and youll have you own custom board.    there a a few part to a skate board you forst have the deack wich is the platform you stand on and it has grip tap on the top. there are the trucks wich are basicly the axles they usuly srew to the botem of the deack. then there are the weels and berings the berins go inside the weels and then they go on to the trucks and a nut is put on to stop the weels from coming of    berings are a big part of the board the decide how fast you go and how long you roll for so youll want to get good ones a popular kind of berings are abecs, a decent abec bering in  abec 5 and higher|`|qMXk1GRgaa	dude, i wanna get things straight, are u skateboarding just to impress your female friend (u said me and her, so its definitely a chick), Peer pressure?

Also when you are skating, dont try to be better than you are. and dont skate just cause you want to be like some professional, you should skate because you want to skate and, if you get good enough, sure you can take a shot at being a pro. Be as best as YOU can, not like anyone else.  ok, back to the parts of the board... You dont wanna get a really expensive board for your first one, try to get a blank board with no logos on it but one that has griptape. Also, its best to skate with a friend or in a group of people incase you get hurt,(trust me, its not fun walking home with a broken arm) oh and dont forget a phone if your actually leaving to skate somewhere (skatepark, a skate spot) Never leave your board out in the rain either (not fun) because once it dries it becomes brittle and breaks easily also you wont be able to get as much pop out of it as you would like.  Remember just skate to the best of your ability and if its your first time skating i highly recommend pads.  Have fun skating!(by the way i put this on another question so dont think im a macro or something)|`|63747bc705167ad22ea56a2ffeaa3dbcaa	It's never too late to pick up something like skating. If you're looking for some info and how to cut down on spending here's some things to think about.   You can probably save some money via buying the parts separate and installing them yourself without that much extra trouble.    Decks are usually easy to get for cheap so go as cheap as you want here (maybe even get a pack of them). Trucks however, are very important. They are axles of your skateboard (they enable your front and back wheels to alternately turn from each other, giving you control over the direction of your board)  It's more than worth it to get some decent trucks to give you lasting, improved performance ( you can always re-install them on another board if your first board gets worn out). Your wheels and bearing are also important, but also wear out with frequent use. For wheels, the softer you go, the more grip you're going to have for turning so that's a plus for turning and landing. The higher grade of bearing you get, the faster and longer you're going to coast for (also increasing your top speed as well). I wouldn't worry about getting high grade bearings until your at a higher skill level.    Once you hook yourself up with a good board there's really not much else you can do but practice like crazy. Make sure you take it easy for a while until you get your balance up though. (Ask your buddy on some beginner tips)    good luck!|`|iVNrOWHLaa	trucks are the things that hold the board to the wheels, its impossible to go without them. and its not late, i just got when i was 14. and it isnt scarry. wear a helmet (not to be a ***...) when your learning the basics, and a friend teaching you would be preferd over anything... ALSO get good bearings...|`|r3BhFqgHaa	you should first learn how not to fall on your *** lol

xxq5JAM6aa	Figure on about 300 cals for your 45 minute, 10 mile ride.    You need to balance your riding with upper body exercise.    1000 cals/day is not enough for a 16 year old riding 10 miles a day on a bicycle. Up that to 1500 minimum when riding, 1200 when not. This should let you lose about a pound a week and be sustainable 'til you reach your weight goal. At that point, 2000 per day with moderate exercise should maintain your weight.    Good luck.|`|TPUJVMeDaa	If you weigh 150lbs and you ride at 15mph for 3 hours you burn roughly 2,000 calories.  Ofcourse this might be easier on a 15lbs road bike compared to a 30lbs comfort bike.|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	Individual variation in size, digestive efficiency, mechanical efficiency, bike setup, and the bike itself make this question impossible to answer with any accuracy.    40 calories per mile is probably close enough for horseshoes, but that could be 20% or more off in either direction depending on you and your equipment.|`|fbxqLErlaa	Here is the key to your question.  How much time does it take to ride 10 miles?  If the answer is an hour, you "MAY" burn 200 calories.  If the answer is 30 minutes, you may burn 400 calories.  Trust me, you have to be in very, very good shape to average 20 mph on a bicycle.  Riding a bicycle burns calories (good) but does not work the stomach muscles(not so good).  Any exercise will burn calories.  If you burn more calories than you take in you reduce the amount of fat on your body.  As far as building muscles, you need strength training.  Weight training will improve your riding.  Also you can target the muscles anywhere on your body.  But if there is a layer of fat over the muscles, you will not see the results of your workouts.  That is the fallacy of just doing stomach exercises.  Fat covers the muscle.  Ads showing people with 6 pack abs have very low percentage of body fat.  Most likely in the 5 to 6 percent range.  As to your last question, the best way is to record what you eat and check your weight.  If you lose about a 1 to 1-1/2 pounds a week on a quality 1000 calorie diet, then stick with the diet.  As you get in better shape you will need to take in more quality calories to maintain your energy levels.  Good Luck|`|KHeR3hGIaa	It's hard to be precise, but I believe I've seen that hard cycling (really pushing yourself) burns around 700 calories/hour.  If you're being leisurely, of course you'll burn less.    1000 calories/day is pretty low.  If you're trying to lose weight, that's probably good, but if you're trying to maintain your weight that might be too little.  Ultimately, eat when you're hungry.  If you start gaining weight, eat less or exercise more.  If you lose weight (and don't want to), eat more.    Bike riding doesn't tone your stomach much, but of course it can help you lose weight which removes fat from everywhere and will make you look better if you're a bit overweight, including your stomach.  I'm not sure which sports really work your stomach.  Ultimately, I'd say don't worry about it -- ride more, diet if you need to, and your stomach will take care of itself.    And don't judge yourself against the supermodels -- in the real world, few people have bodies like they do.

81ZqCu42aa	I like New Balance 8518 GY. It is for cross training.|`|QlzFoBS3aa	This varies with every runner.  (P.S. I mean sneaker when I say shoe) There is no "one" shoe that is good for every runner.  Go to a "running specialty "store in your community (very important, cause they are trained to observe runners in shoes, if they notice you are over pronating or suppinating during a run!) They can recommend another shoe more suited to your body and have your gate checked while running in a new pair of sneakers too, but first know your feet (the folks in these stores will aid here, too) it all depends on your feet and wieght and mileage.  Your foot type, is it high normal or low arches are the feet over flexable or rigid are they very wide with narrow heel like mine. My feet are happiest with Saucany shoe (Saucany brands are best brand for these foot types, I love them, hate New Balance, but I had a family member once who swore by New Balance.) or is your foot wide with a normal heel or narrow.  Above all.....Know if your a Supinator or a Pronator( I am, so I need a stability shoe type) or are you a normal nuetral foot, the most important thing to know is this one!    I have been a runner most of my life(I am in my 50's, it was track and sprinting in high school) I have completed a few marathons and other shorter races as well, I have been a distance runner for 21 years now too.  And you are right about the Money is no object...it's well worth spending a few extra bucks to remain non injured!!  P.S. if no shoes work well for you after all this, consider orthodics, I use them, without them I'd be really out of commision.  Hope this helps!  Happy trails... one runner to another :)|`|rYdEVC0xaa	I just found out about these new shoes coming out for the first time in march this year. go to www.thebiomproject.com. these are designed to work with your foot and to make it feel like it moves for your body specifically.|`|kJDWy3biaa	Just go to Eastbay.com my fellow runner, it makes things a lot easier.

5gKGtSriaa	I'll do the currently best, since I just started liking football.    3 Best Corners:     Rashean Mathis- He's really something special, he didn't do much this year, but most of the time when he picks, he returns. On top of that he has NO support to guard the other WR that Brian Williams and the others should be guarding.    Litto Shepard- He's always there for the pick, but the Eagles as a team are maybe a bigger factor then just himself.    Champ Bailey- He just good...    3 Best Running backs:  *Everyone loves Tomplinson and Clinton, well, personally these guys are much better.       Maurice Jones-Drew (Pocket Hercules)- He's fast, he's smart and he's hilarious! Good recieving RB, and even though the Colts thought that he was just as good as Aidia (sorry, that's wrong) he's much better. He just hasn't shined yet, because the Jaguars have NO offensive linemen what-so-ever! Need I not to say, but he'll also do some special dance that the NFL spokemen were wanting to see all season when he gets his first TD in week 1. It will be a blow out game.    DeAngelo Williams- He's very good to. Not only did he score the MOST running TD's, but he also had 1500 rushing yards and shared 900 rushing yards with Jonathan Stewart! He broke tons of tackles and is a MVP runner. This is also his first starting year.   Darren Sproles- If you didn't see the Chargers face the Steelers, you cheated yourself out of a good one. Darren Sproles has very little rushing yards till LT got ingured, but off a catch for Rivers he out ran what seemed to be 5 guys, one was Polomulu. Any way, if LT doesn't recover, the Chargers are covered, cause this guy is fast!    3 Best Safeties:   Troy Polomulu- Did you see that fumble/ interception he got after someone was hit hard? You know, here's a clip of him doing it http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d...   (and other amazing plays), he's the guys that could be mistaken for an All-star WR. He's just really good, and if I was a team, I'd never go up agianst him.   Brian Dawkins- EAGLES! Actually, I really don't like the Eagles to much, but their D is very strong, sorta like their rivals the Steelers. Personally, I think that Brian Dawkins is the best FS right now, but only when he's feeling like he wants to be great. I also think that the Eagles would have been in the Superbowl, if they hadn't played the Cardinals before.    Ed Reed(ing)- I really dislike this guy. I'm sorry. So years ago, his ego was so high, he tried blockinga punt in the probowl. He's the only player that has ever done that. On top of that, okay, he made a 108 interception return, if you look at the pass McNab threw, it is HORRIBLE! 2 of the defenders are right infront of the WR. It's not Ed who was amazing, but McNad who was bad! You can see for youself, http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d... pause at 5 seconds, it shows all, double coverage on Reggie Brown. His return is good though, but then again, Wesbrook and a left tackle and 2 other skinny players try to stop a living lose-nightmare!     Honestly, I though it was Rashean Mathis who would one day get that, but now he's going to get a 109, even better :). 2009 is the new year, and the Jaguars are going to the Superbowl. Trust me! Rashean Mathis will be a major factor to. David will only throw 3 interceptions, it'll be a great season!      *Overall, the Superbowl will look like the Eagles vrs. Cardinals game. Very close, and as much as I hate them for knocking out my prescious Panthers, the Cardinals will win. But i can still hope!     Enjoy!

TAVl6sigaa	Okay, I see your dilemma. Hmmm.   Well, in short I would say that you should stick with figure skates, but get new ones. Here is my thinking in more detail:  Skating in figure skates are easier because their blades have two edges, and are thicker than hockey skates. The toe pick also helps by sort of catching you before or when you fall (as crazy as it sounds) because it warns you that you are too far forward on your feet, and will also sort of 'spike' your senses, making you put your arms out to steady yourself. These are things that makes it easier to skate in figure skates. Hockey skates may be more comfortable, but will be harder to skate in, especially if you are already adjusted to skating in figure skates.  The reason your feet might be sore and red after skating will be because your skates are not broken into enough. A good example of what happens when you skate in new figure skates is in Ice Princess when she competes with brand new skates. This is because the skates have not yet had time to 'mold' to your foot. So it's stiff, and will not be comfortable. Or it may be because you have not skated in a year, and your feet need time to adjust to wearing skates again. Perhaps it is also because your feet are growing. The first reason is probably why though.  I would say try skating a little more with your skates now, and see if they soften up. Wear your skates on carpet (with the blade guards on of course) and hold the edge of a bed, couch, or similar and jump up and down (with your skates on the carpet) so your feet with 'break' the skate. Bend your knees and jump high repeatedly. That should help a bit. If it does not then I advise investing in new skates. Since you enjoy going once and a while, I would choose Riedell, or Jackson. These are both fairly non expensive, but you will get your money's worth.   Riedell:  http://www.riedellskates.com/ice/121.htm...  http://www.riedellskates.com/ice/117.htm...  http://www.riedellskates.com/ice/112.htm...  http://www.riedellskates.com/ice/110.htm...  Jackson:  http://www.jacksonskates.com/html/frames...  http://www.jacksonskates.com/html/frames...  http://www.jacksonskates.com/html/frames...    Jackson also has a pair of skates which is like a combination of the hockey boot, but with figure skating blades. It might be more what you are looking for. Here is a link to it:  http://www.jacksonultima.com/en/Index.as...  http://www.jacksonultima.com/en/Index.as...  http://www.jacksonultima.com/en/Index.as...  I suggest asking a skating coach, or local skate retail shop if you have any other questions.  I hope I helped, and good luck! :]|`|OFQoL7H9aa	well if the skates are plastic then that's the problem.  I think that you may have too small skates. So buy a new pair at a local sports place. Try them on, move your feet around in them. The toe should not toucj the front of the skate, cause then you won't get any use out of them and your toes will get really cold and will kill cause of no room. And don't wear thick socks get some skating tights(yes i no it sounds weird and professional but it helps) then just wear comfy pants over them, not jeans  Good luck|`|ttbho89Vaa	maybe your feet grew! you said you havent worn them in over a year:] if your going to buy new skates, i suggest the riedell white or yellow ribbons. they will last a while if its only for recreation. if its for like actual figure skating i suggest the riedell blue ribbon up until the level gamma. :] good luck ;]|`|NjPmQelmaa	i think you should stick to the figure skates they look much nicer as well i think your ones now are probably just too small if u buy a bigger pair they will be more comfortable.|`|HaDR9veDaa	try getting cheaper skates with softer leather if you have an arch try Jackson Artiste or if you have hardly any arch try ridell red ribbon    if your skates still fit good just go to a pro shop and have them heat molded again|`|p2V8ryGBaa	Before spending the money on new skates, try bringing your skates to the skate shop and have the ankles punched out. You can also use the round makeup sponges as extra padding.

You hold it like that, not like this, like that. Then you do that, not this, that. Your feet should be like that. When you step forward it should be like that, not this. Never do this and this. If you follow those tips your swing will only be a little bit slower than Corky Miller so you will almost have 950 mph batspeed. Also your not suppose to go on the internet and ask a bunch of strangers. Go to the playground in the afternoon and ask the 2 year olds who are with their parents.|`|qrVkcgduaa	Hold the bat like this, then do this. Make sure you swing like this and put your feet like this.

I play myself in high school but have trained with a few pro players. One of the BEST ways is to get a bucket and fill it with rice.  then take and put on ur batting gloves and roll ur wrists around in the rice for about 1-2 minutes each hand.  this will help u get stronger also. another way is to buy weighted batting gloves and use them while u swing. another way is to use a heavier bat such as a wooden bat while taking batting practice. and the last way is to take something like a broom stick and a string. tie a weight at the end of the string and attach the other end to the broom stick. hold it directly out in front of u and roll the weight upward toward u.|`|aDoMnmDSaa	k so, your standing wrong, you have to stand like THIS, not like that!

Have a good day!|`|NsYIUu3caa	lead w/ the knob of the bat and extend towards the pitcher not in front of you.    leading w/ knob- use your top  hand to simulate punching a midget standing even w/ the front of your lead foot.    RELAX at the plate, tension reduces speed    stay BALANCED as well, a simple shove shouldn't knock you over after you swing    if you're in HS ask your coach about vertical stacking, it's a system that Arizona State used in the 80's and 90's and can be adapted to any style of hitting you choose
jSR318mYaa	Let your coach help you make the best choice.  You should probably try several positions and see what fits both you and your team the best.

PXkvDyYwaa	There isn't anything "wrong" with Felt. The main reason people think one brand sucks is that they like a certain brand and to them, anything else is inferior. Ask your friend for a technical breakdown on frame material, accessories, wheelsets, and price compared to his favorite or "better" bike and then compare them.  Nowadays, many bikes are made in the same factories. Giant makes a lot of bikes for other companies. Though, the other companies still control what stickers, paint, and accessories goes into the bike, many frames are very close to others in quality and materials.  I would be more concerned about where you bought the bike. As in, is the bike shop a good one with Techs that know how to fix my bike if something goes wrong as many Techs aren't as good at BMX as they are in Mountain Bikes.

xbuZFjveaa	You are obviously new so I will try not to confuse you with "pool" language...I will assume you are right handed. If you are left handed, simply reverse everything. Basically, you will hold the back of the pool cue (the 'stick') with your right hand (loose grip-don't hold it tightly) about ten inches from the end, and create a 'bridge' with your left hand to guide the thinner, 'shaft' end of the cue toward the the ball that you are shooting at. The easiest bridge to form is an open one-simply press the knuckle of your thumb against your first finger. That will form a 'V' shape to keep the cue in line while shooting. Set your left hand on the table about eight inches from the white ball and visually line up your shot. Take a few practice strokes before actually hitting the ball, and don't jerk the cue or try to hit theball hard. A medium speed. even, controlled stroke is what works best. For beginners, focus on striking the white ball in dead center. And another tip; don't stand sideways...square your hips to your shot as much as possible. Your right leg will naturally set behind you left a little, and thats fine.  Well, theres a starting point. all thats left now is for you to practice, practice, practice; and adjust your stance as to what is comfortable.|`|1eb29e16166794203a3fa52b5c9b51b8aa	side stick in hands hit the que ball into object ball with small end of stick|`|wf1zbOP6aa	lol its called a cue    hard to explain in words|`|CBKfsrSzaa	for starters its a cue and u hold the the bake bit of the cue and put the other bit in ya fingers

YYqrT4jBaa	The Smart Parts Vibe is a great marker for your price range. It costs around $150 new on eBay. It comes with the ability to use CO2, NO2, and Compressed air. It's electronic with three modes. If you are playing speedball, you will want an electronic hopper. If not it will blend your paint. I linked a paintball review site for reviews for the Vibe. You can look up other things you are looking at purchasing later.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	Dangerous Power Fusion. you can get them for under $300. just search around for 1
vK7pKFvvaa	You do not have to have a FFL to send a gun to a dealer . You have to have a FFL to receive one . Who ever buys your gun needs to send you a copy of their FFL and the payment before you send the rifle . It must only go to the address on the FFL . You may need to show a copy of the FFL to the shipper .|`|TvARYVRJaa	yes  it looks complicated  but jim is correct  make sure the seller is legit ok,,,,,,,,,,,thanks|`|5VELZt7Saa	i think you just have to ship it to an FFL|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	yes you can.  they will have the needed forms and will charge you a fee and shipping.

What would interest you?  Does it reflect your feelings?    Depending on the type of essay you're aiming for, I would suggest you keep it on a personal level, relating the experience to how it affected you as that's where the majority of your knowledge base would be found.
LIKkt8djaa	If the burton snowboard you bought is an ICS system then no you'll need EST bindings to fit it, If it's just your typical 3d hole pattern burton uses than you'll just need to buy an adapter for the bindings to fit the board.|`|904AtSbhaa	yes or if they don't you can just get riser plates and riser plates work fine you just have to get used to them.  Or get a mid- wide or wide board|`|WGamjAwQaa	yes you just need to get a burton plate (that round thing you screw to your board).  you can usually get them for free at most board shops but they might cost a few bucks (like $5)

Jzl3sXWMaa	Skiing?  1. works out mucsels in your legs that are rarely used  2. really fun  3. somthing to do during winter|`|GN918lIWaa	well three of the best things about skiing would have to be...  1) It is very challenging, you can never learn to much!!  2) It gives me something to look forward to on those boring winter days  3) It is really good for your muscles and the perfect workout!!         Love to ski!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|jTaW3goeaa	Great exercise    Great winter fun    you can do it regardless of who you know, by that I mean that when you go to larger schools and you don't know the coaches chances are you won't get much if any playing time, but you don't need to know anybody to snowboard or do any other  sport    Career opportunities    meet new people     a chance to temporarily forget any problems going on in your life and have fun|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	Skiing is great exercise, helps pass the winter months, and give you a reason to blow $5 on one slice of pizza.
mjidg1nwaa	There is something called the "Bejeweler Pro Rhinestone Setter" that you can buy from Jenskates. It is like a mini iron that melts the adhesive under the rhinestones, sticking them to your dress. http://jenskates.com/index.asp?PageActio...|`|oMbrgIBEaa	well you can try at a.c moore   and i have seen it there . i have used it for some of my jackets and it works great!  dont use a hot glue gun. i can just destroy the material of the dress and you'll have a hole in your dress.   if  you dont live near  one then you caould get it at any craft store like Michael's        go on their website and you can find the nearest 1|`|OFQoL7H9aa	i think it's be easier to just get a hot glue gun....i haven't ever heard of what you were talking about sorry. But i've also heard of some sticky stuff that you just put on the rhinestone or whatever.....I'm not exactly sure but I'm the ice skater and my grandmother makes everything for my competitions and shows soo......
