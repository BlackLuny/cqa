20090309182255AAdH2z6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I am writing a fable for my honors English 9 class?	For my honors English class I have to write a satirical fable on a serious issue going on in the world today. I picked how the forests are being cut down to make plush toilet paper for the selfish Americans. We have to look up the characteristics of each animal that we are going to use so that it makes sense for the animal to represent whatever it is representing. I decided to use bears. They will be the ones cutting down the trees and using the soft plush toilet paper while the other animals are using the regular recycled toilet paper. (Now remember, this is a fable, so the animals are supposed to take on human-like characteristics. If you don't know the true meaning of a fable, then you shouldn't even be answering this question.) Anyways, my point is, would it make sense for the bears to play the role of the lumberjacks and the selfish Americans, or is the personality of a bear in real life not very good to play that part. If not, what are some other good animals to use?
20090227111601AAJ0M52	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	I've lost my passion for music... Help?	Well, not really, I still live for music, just not right now. I'm playing in this little Irish band, but it's not going the way I want it to(it's quickly going the way of the Dubliners and Clancy Brothers, which I really don't have any interest in doing). All of the violin parts I play are starting to sound the same, and feel soooo contrived and emotionally worthless. I don't feel the pureness of emotion from any of the music I play anymore, and I feel like the band is pigeon-holing me into playing easy garbage, and pushing me to be faster and faster. That's all they want from me.      Now, I am perfectly happy doing this AS LONG AS I have the opportunity to also get my own folksy-sounding songs out. I do write songs that are fairly Joni Mitchell-meets-Loreena McKennitt sounding... But the band has no interest in doing them...      I don't know what to do at this point. It's killing me to be the band's little trick pony("Play faster, play faster, be happy"), but I need the emotional outlet... The only thing I can think of doing is taking a small sabbatical at the end of the gig season and find myself again...      Suggestions please?

So, I've never posted anything on here for feedback, but I do daily 1-page writing exercises and thought I'd throw a random one up and see what you think. You lose some formatting on here, but the essence is there.    What do you like, dislike, think could be stronger? Thanks in advance for any constructive criticism that you've got for me.        ----------------------------------------...          When in the course of human events it comes to pass that we finally destroy ourselves, what manner of humanity will survive? Will the strong dominate the weak? Will the intelligent rebuild? Will we live in peace or continue to conquer? When the chain of events comes full circle will we break free or begin the pattern all over again?       The answer, of course, is that none of these things will come to pass. We will not repeat the same pattern simply because we cannot. Our cities, our machinations, our advances are gone. But we will not be freed by this, either. We will simply begin a new pattern—slaves to old, failed mindsets incompatible with our new reality.       You see, once started, a society shattered will continue to crumble, much in the same way that a glass, once shattered, will not ever become a glass again. The pieces will remain pieces, though they may be swept into the same dustpan.       That's where I live now, in the dust pan, surrounded by others: broken, cracked, divided. We have come together for survival—for all the good surviving does us in the hell that remains. In another lifetime, my name was Manny; though now most simply call me Scryer. I specialize in finding things. Safe food, uncontaminated water, trinkets of the past that still retain some use. I find shelter when it rains and warmth when it is cold. I find memories and stories of things that were. I find knowledge among ruins (though I am cautious what I share lest we become too confident in our godhood again). But most importantly, I find Others. Other survivors, other stragglers, other shards.       We've come to call ourselves "the Tribe," and we've grown slowly, but steadily, since the fall of man. My role in this—not to sound proud—has not been small, either. I am not the oldest, or the wisest, or the strongest, but I was the first, and that matters a great deal to those who still need to be led.             I was still alone the day I found the large underground maze, a massive stone and tile labyrinth that seemed relatively untouched by the destruction. It was an old subway station, two stories, with still-standing tunnels stretching out for hundreds of yards in four directions. It had a number of smaller rooms, too: old offices, bathrooms, closets, empty train cars, even a small and useless kitchen. Behind one wall I found access to a sewer, long run dry, which expanded the useable size of the place threefold. This was my new home…and my future tomb.             It was only my third visit to the surface when I discovered my first survivor. She had the same idea I did: find what you could that was still good (fuel, food, clothing, weapons) and stockpile it before it spoiled or was taken by another—if there were any others. She was a girl of maybe 15 and utterly cornered by the most foul-looking dog I'd ever seen.       The dog was matted by blood and a bone poked through its chest. It was missing an eye, an ear, and most of the flesh from the left side of its face. Its tongue lolled almost useless between its teeth as it bared its fangs and skull. This creature, too, was broken, hungry, and scared…and even more primal than we were. The visage was fearsome enough as it was, but the hatred that burned in the remaining eye was beyond anything I'd ever seen.       I tried to throw a rock to scare it off, but the beast seemed not even to feel the blow. A second rock briefly turned its attention my way, but it too soon turned back to the girl. She was prey, he was predator, and I…I was merely a bothersome pest.

All I know is that these invasions happened in less than 6 weeks, which was bad for Russia who was increasing their production of military equipment, but thought Germany would take longer (hence why Germany could later advance on to Stalingrad). I also know France is important because of the evacuation of Dunkirk which was one of Hitlers mistakes.       But why else is this important?

And Edward is always with Bella, and she never mentions him leaving for a sec to use the bathroom?      My friend brought this up, and i was like, you know what? I don't know!, so i asked here :)

20090309200657AAblR9Z	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you think life is pointless?	I'm a 21 year old college student, who can't stop thinking about finding meaning in life. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about since we're all going to die, what's the point of living? No matter what we do, it doesn't matter. I guess a part of me is depressed, but I realize that it's silly to be depressed because so many people have it worse than me. I know I should be thankful, I know I have it good..but then why does a part of me feel like this? I also realize that my negative thinking is causing all my frustration, and I do try to change my thoughts, but it's not working Another part of me realizes that I create my own reality, and that I can change all this.   I just don't know the root cause of all my problems. I guess partly I don't know who the hell I am. I don't really have a passion for anything. I have a lot of diverse interests like politics, economics, philosophy, stand up comedy etc. Another thing is I've never been in a relationship and don't desire one. I'm probably asexual. I also never really had close friends and have problems getting close to people. I think "love" is just nature's way of getting us to pro-create and relationships are overemphasized by society. Why must everyone be in one to be happy? Why can't we be happy on our own?   Yeah..I'm kind rambling.   So..how did you find meaning in your life? I'm not asking what the meaning of life is..I'm asking how did you find your own truth and meaning in life?      I guess if I really thought life was meaningless, I wouldn't even be questioning, because that would be meaningless too.
20090309195500AAAaLU8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What is the most romantic or inspirational quote you have ever heard or read?	I like:      "Before you my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars - points of light and reason... And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything"      -Twilight Series      "There's a moment when I look at you and no speech is left in me. My tongue breaks, then fire races under my skin and I tremble and grow pale... for I am dying of such love, or so it seems to me"      -Sappho

20090309200018AAPVWOu	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Will you please read my story?	Life goes on and so do people. They leave you behind with nothing but painful memories of the past.         This is exactly what I thought as I walked through the two Grande, Maplewood doors that lead to my new home-if I could ever call it home. My ′new home′ was a three story orphanage with over 290 kids. I didn′t mind that, or the fact that I had to share my bedroom with 5 girls and 3 boys, of course not. What really got me worried was the building itself.         The Willowburgh Orphanage was tilting sideways, to the left to be exact. The grey bricks were weathering with age and the four columns that sustained it had cracks all over. ′It's a wonder it's still standing,' I thought.         Chewing a wisp of my dark brown hair, I looked back at the taxi that had brought me from Evansville, Indiana to Indianapolis, Indiana and now to Willowburgh Orphanage in the swampy depths of New Orleans. It had been three months and 2 days since I lived in Evansville, and three months and three days since my parents died. Albert, the taxi driver and also a friend of my parents,' drove me to Indianapolis the day my parents died. Now, Albert and his yellow taxi left me at the feet of the she-devil herself, but of course I didn′t know that.         Laura Chardell, though she went by Mrs. Chardell, had been my legal guardian for the last two months. She walked beside with her new and expensive high-heels. Her blonde, waist-length hair billowed behind her as she took a step into the ancient building. I had always envied Mrs. Chardell′s milky blonde hair. It looked so angelic and beautiful next to my tangled brunette hair.        I let a gasp escape me as I took a look at my surroundings. I was now on a Welcome Matt, staring at a Grande staircase and two hallways going either side of it. The staircase had long-lost it′s beauty and the red rug at the foot of the stares had faded to maroon. Chandeliers hung from the ceiling-and so did cobwebs. Yeah. This was going to be great. The blood stains on the floor said it all.      ''Hello, Hello, Hello!”         The voice broke into my thoughts. Immediately I looked up at the top of the staircase to find the source of the high-pitched sound. The voice came from the mouth of a plump old lady in a pin-stripe suit. I stifled a gasp of horror as a studied the features on her face. Her eyes were glowing amber with stone-white lips. It was obvious she was wearing mascara, even from the bottom of the stairs. But what had really shocked me was the brown mole, right under her nose and right above her stone lips.      ''Hello, Mrs. Mason?'' asked Mrs. Chardell in her soft voice.      ''Laura? Is that you?'' chimed the Mrs. Mason      ''I go by Mrs., Chardell, actually.''      ''Ah, yes, got married was the case? I never found much use in marriage, but I thought I might as well, you know?''      ''Yes, well, this is Mary. Mary Souver.''      ''Ah yes! Welcome!''      ''Mason, do you mind? I have a very tight schedule.'' Mrs. Chardell was already walking out of the door as she said so.      ''Well, goodbye then! Tah-tah!'' said Mrs. Mason, but Mrs. Chardell was already in the taxi, driving toward the horizon.         Uh-oh! I was stuck here now. Mrs. Chardell was gone. I looked left and right, looking for some kind of escape route. I could climb out of window in the east end; Mrs. Mason couldn't possibly catch me with those chubby legs of hers. And the door was still open...right behind me...No, my father, dead or not, had taught me to always face my problems and never run away from even the biggest things I got myself into.      ¨Mary isn't it?'' prompted Mrs. Mason. Her friendly smile had disappeared and her glowing amber eyes were glimmering with hatred. ''Mary Goober?''      ''Souver'' I corrected.      ''Humph, Goober, Souver, what's the difference?''         This wasn't a question, duh! But being myself and all, I had to answer, even though that was obviously not the right thing to do.      ''Well, ma'am, first of all S and G are two different letters with two very distinct sounds. Second of all-''      ''I didn't ask for an explanation did I?'' she interrupted in her soprano voice. “Here at Willowburgh you do things when your masters tell you to do so? Understood?''         I nodded vigorously, fury making me clench my fists.      ''Good. Now, come here, I want to take a good look at you.''         Reluctantly, I began to climb up the stairs, my one and only suitcase I dragged behind me. I counted each stair in my mind, trying my best to keep myself from attacking the old hag. When I got to about stair 20 (the middle) I felt gravity pull at me, yanking me to the ground. I fell down the stairs in a series of back and front rolls and a few cartwheels.  Everything went by quickly, making the world seem like a big mush pot. At one moment I heard I crack at the back of my head.         Finally, I felt a thump as I reached the bottom of the grand stairs. Instinctivley, I pulled my hand from under my suitcase and  felt the back of my head for any

The way the whipping wind tossed the trees branches back and forth made it look as if they were dancing.    There was scattered books every where on my floor and on my furniture and I knew that my father would make me clean my room once he saw it, not that it really mattered because I made it perfectly clear that I didn’t like other people in my room and my dad respected that.    I never wanted this perfectly normal, simple night to end, but of course there was school tomorrow and I absolutely despised that part of my life.     I wasn’t tired at all, so randomly; I picked up a book next to me. I grabbed a simple book that I once read in eighth grade called To Catch a Pirate by Jade Parker. I suppose this book was a little out of my league but I loved it. I guess the fact that it was a simple love story with a few twists in it made me love it. It was one of the first love stories that had a happy ending that satisfied me without question. I had school tomorrow and it was rather late so I only reread the most romantic parts;       “Anna,” he rasped.    It was the first time he’d ever called her by name. In his voice, she heard the longing that mirrored her own. She was vaguely aware that she’d turned, that his arms were suddenly holding her close that she was looking up into his eyes…    He dipped his head and kissed her.    And it was as though the tempest had returned. A storm of desire swept through her. While she knew it was wrong to kiss him, she lacked the will to withdraw.    Everything about this moment was wrong. And yet she couldn’t deny that she never wanted it to end. With his lips against hers, she could hear the music of the sea. Or perhaps it was only her heart singing. She’d never known anything as wondrous.      I never understood that paragraph so well. How could Anna love James and yet think that moment was out of place? Of course he was a pirate and she was a first class teenager, but if she truly, and deeply loved him she would accept that moment. Wouldn’t she? Love stories usually remained an enigma to my mind.    The wind whistled and I decided to put the book down and try to fall a sleep, besides I would have school tomorrow and I would only have a couple hours of sleep if I stay up and challenge my mind to such unexplainable questions.    I closed my eyes and tried to think of ways to clear my mind. The only thing I enjoyed about sleeping was that I could think about anything I wanted to think about and hope that I would dream about it. Usually I would think about something but have a dream about something totally different but I guess it didn’t matter because usually I would forget about that dream as soon as I open my eyes. It would be extremely rare if I actually remembered a dream. But the dreams I usually remember are horrible ones. But I rarely never have nightmares anymore which I’m thankful for.    I had too much on my mind to think about and my eyes wouldn’t stay shut. I put The Four Seasons by Rivaldi in my CD player, my favorites were June and Winter. I set the volume low enough so that it was just barely background music, music usually worked as a lullaby when ever I’m trying to fall in deep sleep. The whistling wind went perfectly with the pianos remedy and I couldn’t help but smile to myself at the peacefulness. Before I knew it I was sleeping soundlessly.      “Ugh!” I scolded myself for waking up late. I darted down towards the bathroom and tried to take a quick shower before school but I just found myself becoming more behind schedule then I had expected. I quickly stuck on some new clothes that my mom bought me a couple days ago but there was not much I could do with my ghastly hair that just swung straight down a little bit past my shoulders.    “Dad, do you mind if I borrow your car for school today?” I tried to say it as commendable as possible because I really did not want to walk to school in this horrendous pour.   “Sure, but where’s yours? Oh that’s right; it’s still at the mechanic from yesterday’s accident.” I was flushed with embarrassment remembering how I messed up the ignition last night when I was driving home from school   “Oh… yeah, sorry again about that.”   “You better be.” I heard the playfulness in his deep voice but I also heard a little bit of bitterness in it as well.   “I think I might be home a little late tonight, I was planning on going to mom’s for a while after school”   “Oh I understand, you two have to catch up on some gossip don’t-ya?”   “Yeah that’s it,” I lied. I actually just really missed her, I’m a teenage girl; I needed my mom, but my dad wouldn’t understand that.   I grabbed a handful of Lucky Charms

20090309200809AA76UBr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A Midsummer Night's Dream  Help?	Now this is going to get pretty deep. This question is for anyone who has read this amazing and funny play by Shakespeare. I have to write a study guide and it involves some pretty deep thinking, which I am no good at.       If you can post notes and ideas on any of them, that woulld be great.      Or If you knew where this information could be found.      Well Here goes nothing...      1. Use of language: Notice the ways in which Shakespeare uses different types of   language (prose, blank verse and rhyme) throughout the play. Keep track of the changes   between these different types. After you begin to see a pattern of use, pose possible   reasons for this/these pattem(s).        2. Plots (Plural): Identify the number of plots at work in this play and those speci?c   characters involved in each plot. How do characters in one plot interact with characters in   another plot? Where do you see paralleled action? Where do you see contrasted action   between the plots? How does Shakespeare use these similar-—yet different--—plot lines to   create a sense of unity for the play as a whole?      3. Narrative Structure: As is the case of most stories, this p1ay’s action follows a   linear, forward—moving storyline. How does it also establish a circular pattern? Explain   how both a linear pattern and circular pattern occur.      4. Plot Progression: As with all comedies, the plots in this play progress from con?ict ·   to harmony. More speci?cally, the plot will include:        A. Exposition (Tensions  or implicit conflict build between characters in an opening situations)    B. Rising Action     C. Turning Point    D. Falling Action    E. Conclusion   Identify and explain each of the above items (A-E).      5. Imagery: Keep a lookout for striking imagery created by Shakespeare’use of   language in this play. What kind(s) of imagery is/are created? Record types and where   exactly they are located (Act.scene. lines) Explain why THESE types of imagery are   used.      6. Doubling: What doubling of characters do we see in this play? Why is this doubling   included? How does this doubling contribute to the play’s main ideas and/or themes?      7. Tranformations What are some of the literal and figuritive transformations in this play?

20090309203716AAZkFjb	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What book is this?  Dragons?	When I was in 6th grade we read an excerpt from a book and since then I've always wanted to finish it.  The problem is that it's been 7 years since then and I can't remember the title, but I do remember the gist of the excerpt.      It's starts out with a boy who really wants to be a dragon rider.  It describes that there are different classes of dragon fighters based on their color.  I also remember that the boy is small and picked on by boys in his dragon classes.  They're all waiting for the eggs to hatch and the dragons will then choose which boy will be there's.  I can also remember that the boy stays after and talks to an egg with special markings.     *now this is the part that gets murky*   I think one of the big mean boys keeps the main small boy from going to the hatching.  The boy is very sad, but it turns out that one dragon doesn't pick a boy...   Does this sound familiar to any one??

20090309205910AAslQBm	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	Can i learn to draw for my career?	So ever since i was about 7 years old i have LOVED to play video games, and i really mean a lot (im a senior in high school now)      i always just loved how the creatures and people in video games looked and acted, a whole world for me, and i have a huge imagination, i can think of battles and creatures randomly and i would act them out when i was younger, and i still think about them (without acting them out)      when i was starting high school i was thinking "maybe i should grow up to make video games since i have such a great imagination" and i have literally thought of my own ideas for video games and everything      except one problem, i can not draw for the life of me, every time i try to draw i just have no idea where im going and it never looks too great =(      i took art classes in middle school but i never did good in any of them, and i was paying attention the whole time      i just have no idea what to do anymore, i thought i would like to go into something medical/biological since biology was fun freshman year, but AP bio is just so uninteresting for me and im realizing that im not really into biology like i thought i was      so now im thinking of the whole creating games thing, but i still dont know how to draw at all and i have friends in my classes who draw extremely well and never took any classes, and ive tried to practice a lot but nothing ever comes out right      so my question is, am i going to have to learn how to draw to pursue anything in this field? if so, can i learn how to draw from being really bad at it, or is it something you're born with?

20090309213629AAb4VT9	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writers, does this ever happen to you?	OK, I'm a writer (unpublished one anyway!) and the thing that really disturbs me is that I really CANNOT describe scenes properly! For example if I want to describe a birthday scene in one of my books, I HAVE to look at another book (in which there is a birthday scene) and then copy it down, not as a whole of course but just a few descriptions etc...      And when I want to describe a castle, I get a stack of fantasy books where there is adescription of a castle and get ideas from that.       This is really annoying the heck out of me. I don't want to copy out things from other books. I want to rely on myself for describing EVERYTHING.       Does anyone else has this problem? How do I get rid of it?

I just finished Eon and I'd like a similar book with a similar theme of discovering alien and/or advanced artifacts with secrets to uncover, etc.  I'd definitely prefer a book leaning more towards "hard" sci fi.  I'm not that interested in the sequels to either book mentioned (as sequels of books that don't end with the intention of a sequel too often feel contrived.)  I'll also take any outstanding "hard" sci fi recommendations.  Thanks in advance!

Serenade-by Edgar Allan Poe-      So sweet the hour, so calm the time,    I feel it more than half a crime,    When Nature sleeps and stars are mute,    To mar the silence ev'n with lute.    At rest on ocean's brilliant dyes    An image of Elysium lies:    Seven Pleiades entranced in Heaven,    Form in the deep another seven:    Endymion nodding from above    Sees in the sea a second love.    Within the valleys dim and brown,    And on the spectral mountain's crown,    The wearied light is dying down,    And earth, and stars, and sea, and sky    Are redolent of sleep, as I Am    But list, O list,- so soft and low    Thy lover's voice tonight shall flow,    That, scarce awake, thy soul shall deem    My words the music of a dream.    Thus, while no single sound too rude    Upon thy slumber shall intrude,   Our thoughts, our souls- O God above!    In every deed shall mingle, love.            I'm trying to understand the meaning of it all.   i love how this poems flows so well.

20090309183255AAAO3V9	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Here is something that i have been working on?	I had to do the most cruel thing today I had to fire my brother who had only worked there for a week. his life was going down the drain and I could do nothing to stop it. I thought I came up with a bright idea by giving him a job at my restaurant that I built form the ground up a lot of blood and sweat went into my dream place. I had to fire him because He came to work dunk off his *** reeking of stale alcohol and grabbing on the waitresses in not a friendly manner. I shock my head trying to get rid of the thought he was not a little boy anymore I could only save him for so long.    I bought my own piece of paradise it was in the country about thirty minutes from where I worked. I finally pulled up in my driveway about one in the morning. I knew where I would go to release all of the stress that sat upon my shoulders.     I sat at my open window letting the cool night air travel through my cotton pajama pants. As the cold air mixed with the heat from my body, A shiver went up my back, that sent goose up in response.     I was gazing out into the night sky looking at the shimmering diamonds that millions took for granted. You did not have to go to the museum to see this piece of art work.     My mind then began wonder off  “If you wished on a shooting star, would your wish really come true or was it just a myth?”     I was in my own wonderland when I was sent crashing to my bedroom floor, nothing to coushin my fall . A throbbing pain shoot up my arm but where it hit it did not penetrate my skin “Something hit me oh my gosh what the hell” I stayed on the ground in shock my back to the floor and eyes on the ceiling .     The pain subsided in a matter of seconds. I sat up wondering if anything else would come through the window. “what was it that hit me“ I kept looking on my ground for what it could have been but nothing was on the floor.          Tell me anything that you would like is it bad good or what?what do i need to change??
20090310003916AAHmyrs	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	PLS HELP ME with my amatuer poem..?	i would like feedback on my poem and how i can develop it?      Do you have a love,   you feel is your own sun?   Many people do,   but speak of sun’s love, it has not been done.   God made this universe in seven days   the sun and moon on the first.   The couple enjoyed six days of bliss   and on the seventh the moon in tears burst.      For the Father hath commanded   the sun and moon to part,   to provide day and night   for his most precious pieces of art.   The humans on earth   whom God loved the most,   were in need of day and night   while on earth as hosts.   So the sun and moon   are forced to orbit around earth.   Longing for their love,   and a relationships rebirth.   Until the fiery and of this place   the givers of day and night   spin ‘round and ‘round this earth.   Waiting for their love, even just the sight.   But once every while,   there comes an eclipse,   where the lovers can meet   and share a moment of bliss.

20090227142326AAe2iSn	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	Short story ideas or tips from these titles for English Language exam?	I ended up writing like an essay below so just skip to the titles at the end if you want!      My English Language exam is in June and I'm happy with most of it like the media stuff and writing letters or articles and whatever, but then we have to write a short story using one of their six titles. I find it really hard to be creative under time pressure and stress from the exam, my mind goes blank and I can never think of anything original that every other person won't be writing about and I can't make a short story go anywhere! I'm predicted A* but I'll never get it if I can't learn to be creative in the exam! I'm one of those people who gets predicted A* in every subject but instead of feeling happy about it feels stressed and overwhelmed. It's way too much pressure, they expect A*  and I can only equal that or more likely do worse than that and end up with 'only' As.   These are some examples of titles from past papers, can anyone give me any story outlines, ideas or tips? The titles are quite general but they put me off, I wish we could just write anything! I suppose people would prepare a story then. Also, are the examiners looking for a good story, or are they looking for someone who can tick all the right boxes and put metaphors, similes, onomatopoeia, semicolons and obscure vocabulary in, even if it doesn't fit? Don't say ask the teacher - no chance of any help! And people who get the best marks often copy movies they've seen or books they've read - is that a good idea or not?! I'm really boring so I can't write from my own experiences or it would send them to sleep :-/ Is it a good idea to plan the story or not because I'm quite slow at writing stories and you don't get much time?      Here are some titles:   The Fugitive   Write about a time when you felt ashamed of yourself   The Journey of a Lifetime   Continue the following: "Everyone said you should never go back but I could not resist..."   An Unforgettable Moment   The Gift   A Night Out   Write about a time when you had to look after a neighbour's pet   Begin with: "Sarah knew there was trouble coming as Mrs Thomas closed the door."   End with: "My mother just looked at me and said 'I told you it would never work.' I realise now that she was absolutely right."

I'm not really into books where the characters are still in high school or college (struggling with peer pressure, crushes, and boys :P). I like characters like Sophie Kinsella's Rebecca Bloomwood in Confessions of a Shopaholic. She works, shops, has her own way of thinking, impresses people.. etc. I'm excited to look for more interesting books like that. Think you could give me a list?? Thanks alot!

20090310011320AAuoUyL	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Do you ever feel the need to test your survival instinct?	Every day when I wake up I hope for a major disaster (I prefer it be natural even though man made are so much more catastrophic) to happen that would test my ability to survive.  Whenever I walk into a public place (like the mall, bank, retail store) I hope someone attempts to rob it at gun point.  Or when I fly, I wouldn't really mind if the pilot needed to crash land in a hostile environment.  I guess I think life is too boring.  It's not that I don't try to live an exciting life.  I've been skydiving, took flying lessons, I go snowboarding and surfing and I have a good social life, I guess I just bore easily.        One thing that comes to mind are the "manhood" tests boys must complete in order to become men in certain cultures.

And is the reason why Kyle is so heavy is because of his height and muscles?

20090227143924AAyb3US	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What would be a good closing sentance for this chapter?	Chapter 3         The Castle   After living in the Castle, I know a lot about this place.  One of the places is the Garden.  It is an amazing place filled with colors.  There are trees which serve fruit, and plants which serve vegetables.   Before you walk in, there is a beautiful arbor with vines and flowers on it.  The grass is the greenest grass you will ever see in a lifetime.  There are flowers next to the arbor and two cherry trees diagonal from the arbor.  When you walk in, the grass is even greener.  Adaleide’s family takes good care of it.      Another is the inside of the Castle.  Inside there is amazing pictures.  Adaleide tells me that they are her ancestors.  They must have been painted by a rich man, or woman.  There are also scented flowers around the castle.  Some are purple, pink, yellow and my favorite, red!  Those are tulips, but there are different kinds of flowers too; there are daisies, columbines and roses!  Adaleide’s parent’s room is also very beautiful.  There are pictures of the garden, and the forest (in its nice places.)  Then there is my room, I share a room with Adaleide.  It’s lots of fun though.  We like to pretend we are nights fighting the evil dragon on our wall.  There is a picture of a night, a princess hiding in a dark, spooky cave which we think is the dragons den.  Then there is a large dragon that is on the wall, and the ceiling!  He is a ferocious dragon steeling the princess, which Adaleide and I named Princess Aurora; we think that is the most beautiful name in the world, especially for a princess.  Adaleide says that we are not really princesses, she just says that we live in a castle, but I believe that if you live in a castle, you are one. If that is true though, then I guess I just pretend that I am a princess even though Gracia never calls me a princess even when I ask her to.  I don’t like Gracia, but she does clean this place.      Over all, this is a nice place, but the bad parts about the castle, is these comments.   First of all, there is a big well, and it is too deep, and the bucket is too big that I am afraid I will fall in, and the bucket is so heavy to lift.  Sometimes though, I wonder what’s in there.  Another thing is that Gracia always gives us too many chores and never agrees with us.  Lastly, there is a big hole in the garden, and Gracia is too lazy to fill it in.  She always says “I have much more important stuff to do than to fill in that large hole, so if you want it filled in so badly, how about you just do it yourselves!”  What really bugs me is that she says this while reading a book next to the fireplace.  She never really cares about anything.         Also you can tell me some mistakes you see.

Again don't take it wrong but me give me your honest opinion about both poems please ;] thanks.      Day To Day      Cranially its hard to stay sane   Take each comment with a grain of salt   When I walk through the halls   I keep my head high I know they talk   Hawking me scrutinizing not only my looks    but skin color.   They dig deeper throwing mixtures of stereotypes    and aphorisms on me stinging like salt.   I thought it might end there   Taunting me with that six letter word   Haunting memories of what my ancestors fought for   Sought for,became distraught for.   It's like a world war,   walking down a hallway full of hate trying to blend in like decor.   Racists..I feel their insecurities pouring down like spring showers   Cowards can only fling cliche`s and generalizations   Does it empower,   you to belittle a race?   No,no your just sour because finally a race is progressing.   I'm expressing the fury I feel each day when they try to lessen   my race to impress their friends.   I'm guessing you feel inadequate.   Maybe you weren't nurtured as a child that's it.   You emit such ignorance   Chanting about lancing different races and shi*   That's twisted get your head out of 1956   That's it.      Statistics      Girls losing innocence by the minute    I don't get it?   Open your mind not your legs   please hear this.   You have your whole life to get intimate   Just quit it   Submitting now you've become another statistic   With this    child in your arms   It will never be simplistic   Lets be realistic   You could've been a little more moralistic   Or stayed at home and been artistic   I don't mean to be antagonistic   But this    has gotten you nowhere   Your spare time   Will consist of kissing away tears   Singing away fears    Fastening high-chairs   Forget social affairs   Trips to daycare   Is it unfair?   To be pushed into adulthood   before any child should.   If you could   have stopped it?

Now, she's tempted to not do it.   Is it wrong?   Well, how would you know?   Your history of clouded judgment makes her wonder.   Such a sweet girl, you have corrupted.   Such a sweet girl to have fallen for you   She can't open her eyes.   Has your blindness spread to her?         My little girl, has pain become you?   This world is full of every worst thing imaginable.   My little girl, what shall be?   Not what will always be dreamt.   If only simplicity was simple.   Hush now, my little girl.   For the day is at its end   And no one can harm you in your sleep.   Not even that wonderful boy of hers.

20090227142145AAaZqiQ	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Painting	Acrylic Paint/Fabric Paint Questions?	I know this has been asked a *lot* of times, but I still can't make up my mind.      I want to paint a design on a dress, as cheaply as possible.      I've heard that acrylic can be used in place of fabric paint because of its permanence, but I still feel a little uneasy about it all.      Do I need to spend a lot of money to get good quality acrylic?      -  http://www.amazon.co.uk/A2-Students-Acry...       These seem good, and the colours are what I want, but does anyone with experience know what they might be like to paint fabric with?   Also, this might seem like a dumb question but how thick do you think they'll be?   I've used acrylic from larger bottles before which have been liquid but whenever I've used it from tubes it's been quite thick and goopy and I don't think I'll be able to paint the dress well if it's like this?      Also, about the acrylic medium you're supposed to add.   Should I trust one that's this cheap?      -  http://cuddlybuddly.com/products/1037/de...       I ask this because most others seem to be quite a bit more expensive, like this one:      -  http://www.studioartshop.com/acatalog/in...       Which one should I buy?   Also, how much would I need to use?   I will be painting a fair amount onto the dress, so is the first one too small?      Or do you have any other suggestions?      Like I said, I'm on a budget so please bear that in mind. :)      I'm completely new to all this, but I really wanna paint this dress!   Thanks.

I felt a moment of inspiration as I was thinking about her. I let my heart spill out onto the paper. I'm currently 15 years old. She's 14. if you were to receive this (no matter what your age), what would you say?            The light of the stars shines on the sea and lights my love which rests on the wake alighting you.   The strength of the high tide pushes me to your beach. I'm prisoner of your beauty , and like the waves that blend together I surrender in you, my unique love.   Two brilliant eyes, as deep as the sea, enchant as sirens. They have bewitched my heart, and now it wants only you.   You are my splendid moon, you are the moon and have my heart for ever because I'm prisoner of your beauty and surrender in your arms.

I am in year 9 and for SOSE (like History) I have been asked to write a letter home from an Anzac digger fighting in the trenches at Gallipoli. So just wanting to know everyone's opinion!      Here it is:      To my dearest Elizabeth,      I sit here in the rotting trenches, trying to get my mind off the war going on around me. The incessant sound of rifles and men screaming in pain is beginning to consume me. I will be lucky to come out of here sane, let alone with my life.      The pointlessness of this war is beginning to sink in. I have seen so many of my fellow Anzac’s die; it is disheartening to say the least. I myself know of my inevitable fate, as I will be sent over the top tomorrow.      The living conditions here are insupportable of human life. As if the plagues of flies, lice and rats aren’t enough the weather here in Gallipoli is ruthless. In winter, the rain seems everlasting and in summer, the heat makes the dead bodies reek.      I mourn today over the loss of my good friend Jack. He died fighting for his country, fighting for his friends and fighting for his life. Oh, how I wish this would all finish, the pain seems unbearable. As my friends die in combat, all I can do is watch helplessly.      You should know that I will always love you and I am doing this for you.   Yours always,   Jacob         So, what do you think?
