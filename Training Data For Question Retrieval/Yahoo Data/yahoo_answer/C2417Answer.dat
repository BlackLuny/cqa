She was never there in the book!! and yeah way way way different but still pretty good. I can hardly recall anything similiar between the book and the movie. You know how.....WHAT WAS HER NAME?!....did it start with an A?? Well anyway she won her right to be with Gabriel well in this it says that there was a prophecy and it had been decided.

What you describe is a perfect example of what's know as confirmation bias, which is a primary cause of magical thinking.    Basically what's happening, is that your brain remembers (what it considers) remarkable coincidences, while forgetting everyday occurrences.  For instance, if you happen to be thinking of a particular song, and you turn on the radio and they just happen to be playing that song, you remember that event.  But you don't remember all the countless other times you turned on the radio and they were playing a different song.  So in your mind, the coincidences you remember appear way out of proportion to all the many more non-coincidences you didn't remember.  The result being, maybe you start thinking you have some ability to predict what song's playing on the radio, when you really have no such ability.|`|ti97SKNSaa	years? very very seldom, a few days of absence on the other hand maybe every few months|`|bdeb4da71e553971e11438bdeb0fcdaeaa	Happens all the time?

1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	"Sara's Face" by Melvin Burgess  http://www.amazon.com/Saras-Face-Melvin-...  "Seventeen-year-old Sara wants to be spectacular. Not just pretty, not just popular, but spectacularly famous. She is a borderline anorexic, purposely hurts herself, often adopts different personalities, emits her own special perfume smell, and sees ghosts, among other things. When pop idol Jonathon Heat takes her under his wing, she crosses into a world of lunacy and cosmetic surgery to reach her goals. An eerie Michael Jackson-esque figure, Heat lives on a wacky estate with a private plastic surgery theater and has undergone so many facial reconstructions that he's forced to cover his pieced-together face with a mask. After Sara moves into his compound, readers are led to believe that she will meet the same fate, or worse. Known for edgy, raw teen novels that pull no punches, Burgess certainly delivers his trademark sexual frankness, folding in the issues of body image, self-mutilation, and personality disorder."|`|CUiNJLWmaa	Sara's Face by Melvin Burgess.

ceBTTCPwaa	Dickinson is taught in American literature and poetry classes in the United States from middle school to college. Her poetry is frequently anthologized and has been used as texts for art songs by composers such as Aaron Copland, Nick Peros, John Adams and Michael Tilson Thomas.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	She inspired many through her use of language and her visualization of nature.    "My Life had stood  a Loaded Gun" is counted among Dickinsons greatest poems, and is certainly representative of her body of work. The poems style, depth of thought, concise language, and simultaneous definition and ambiguity combine to make this poem a masterpiece. This is a scholars poem, and youre brave to be taking it on, trust us. After youve chewed on it, let it sit for a while, we can guarantee that it will be well worth the effort.

TI06IsACaa	You say that the person is not free who has a gun to his head you are wrong. He is free to do whatever he wants in that situation. He can try to run, he can stand still or he can try to fight. All these are up to his "random" choice which is free will. The person with the gun chose to use his free will to put the other in that situation. The fact that humans cannot choose to live or die when they are shot is not contradictory to free will. Since humans are humans, they die when shot in the head. It isnt random that they die when shot in the head. Someone trying to persuade your actions with the use of physical force in no way disproves free will. Just because your life is on the line does not mean you do not have the choice to act. Your life may end as a result of your actions, but you still had the choice until your life ends.     I put random in quotes because free will can be thought of as random. Since a person may choose to change his mind at any point for any reason he wishes. I dont usually find opponents of free will who are not determinists or think that nothing can be random.    To tell you the truth, your thoughts after your question in no way make any type of argument against free will. Determinists are much harder to talk to.    Edit: You do not have free will to break the laws of nature, or the laws of your existence. Free will cannot even apply to functions outside of reality or your ability. You define free will as humans could only have free will if they can DO whatever they want disregarding reality. Free will defined properly is humans can CHOOSE TO DO anything they want within the limits of their nature. Free will must be derived from the axioms Existence exists, A is A. The law of Identity. Humans are humans, they exist with a mind and free will to use their humans abilities.....since they are human.     If you want me to agree with you, that humans can't defy reality..do something impossible..then fine i'll agree on that point. But that does not have anything to do with free will.|`|v1A9lxuzaa	okay, although I am restrained by morals, conscience, legality, unwritten rules of society e.t.c. I still have the freedom to ignore all that if I choose. However, if I do choose to exercise my free will there may be negative consequences, these consequences may limit my free will (eg sent to prison). This seems to be a bit of a paradox to me, in that I have the freedom to do what I want (free will) but the negative effects can take that away. Even god wouldn't have free will. Ask yourself this - if god is infallable, can he create a rock so heavy that even he can't lift it...|`|gU2WeT55aa	This is a very hard question to answer, mostly because cause/effect is a very strong argument.        Determinism states that if a situation happens (cause), then the effect will have no choice but to happen.  So the only way the effect could happen is if the cause were exactly the way it was. A simple way to think of it is, say theres rock. The rock isnt going to explode into pieces or slide across the floor.  Those are effects.  The cuase was hitting it with a hammer or pushing it.  The way that rock fell apart could only have happened if it were hit in tht precise way.  So say that if you are able to go back in time and repeat the experiment infinite times.  Every time, if hit in the exact way, the rock would have no choice but to crumble that way.      So going off your gun to the head idea. Through determinism you would say that all through this persons life, he was brought up by causes that had no choice but to come to this effect.  If he chooses to pull the trigger it is because through a chain of causes and effects, going back probably forever, and it could have happened no other way.  No matter what, the cause is there and there can only be one efefct, just like with the rock.  If you could repeat it, it would always happen the same way.    Taken from wikipedia, on  Indeterminism:    Necessary causes:    If x is a necessary cause of y; then the presence of y necessarily implies that x preceded it. The presence of x, however, does not imply that y will occur.    Sufficient causes:    If x is a sufficient cause of y, then the presence of x necessarily implies the presence of y. However, another cause z may alternatively cause y. Thus the presence of y does not imply the presence of x      Through indeterminism, it states several factors can alter the effect.  So going back to our example, the the person with a gun to his head could have come to this effect by his own cause, but also it could have into effect by some other cause (Z). So really anything could have happened the this person(x), but they would not have changed the effect that z would/could have made.  That ruins the concept of determinism.        Well, thats the best answer i can give with the time.|`|vAf6ZSNaaa	Just breath deeply and think that everybody are like me! Nothing is too important than yourself!|`|spYpsixUaa	"It's a plain fact that even now, in Paris, France, Louie Pasteur is coming up with a vaccine that will make Hoof-and-Mouth disease a thing of the past!"    Choice and Randomness do not negate Cause and Effect!  If I were to look at a glass of water, pick it up and know that if I were to let it go, I am certain that Luke's Gravity would cause it to fall to the floor.  It wouldn't just float there (in defiance) just because I negated the laws of Cause and Effect by the mere act of making a decision. In the same way that my question presupposes the existence of "True Goodness" within our Reality, your argument presupposes that the existence of Choice and Randomness can actually negate certain laws of Physics.    I mean, imagine!  A world without Anthrax?  What would that be like?|`|AA11957638	You've got the concept of freedom wrong.  Freedom is not the ability to choose without any restrictions, it is the ability to choose goodness.      Everyone wants good things, things that they think that they would like.  That is because goodness is the proper object of our wills.  If you think about it honestly, everything that we want, we also think is good in some way.  Thus, freedom is really the ability to choose goodness.      Free will allows someone to decide which causes and which effects are good.  Props to Luke for pointing out that some laws must be followed.  This is no limitation to a free will, because free will only decide which actions are good.  Thus, as someone pointed out also, if you drop a glass, the laws of nature cause the glass to break.  Free will allows one to say that both dropping the glass and the glass breaking are not good and to act upon that decision by not choosing to drop another glass.|`|K2pdxaadaa	You intimidate me to the point where I don't want to try to answer your question.|`|AA11564934	obviously we have more options to use in reacting to stimuli than an amoeba.  And more than a cat.  Free will is a continuum.  100% free will would entail deciding whether to take each breath, deciding who to fall in love with, etc...  We have more than any other creature on earth, but clearly are also subject to instinct in many cases.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...on my own free will, i agree...  ...thanks for sharing...|`|uyQXdKLiaa	Many people seem to think that because they have a Will that it is also free. The basic argument for the existence of free will is that in any given situation a man [can] make a choice. The fallacy being that it's not what choice he can make, but what choice he will make. The choice that he will make is dependent upon everything that causally affects his Will. In order for the Will to be free, it would have to be free from the elements that causally define it, that is to say, the will would have to be free from itself.     This is easy to see in retrospect. Looking back on a choice one has made the question to ask would be, "Why did he make the decision that he made?" If one can answer this question then there is no such thing as freewill. (because this means that the will is dependent on external factors)    This argument, tho ancient as it may be, is pointless. It's all semantics. Everyone who recognizes the relationship between cause and effect does not really believe in free will, they merely do not understand what is meant by freewill.    Edit: I know and i didn't expect you to; i just like to share my thoughts.|`|AA11894640	Free will is a lollipop given to pacify the child....when he cries to be taken out...

IMHwA20jaa	hmm...for me, I think that would be too short. But, that's just me :)|`|OjQxKGC0aa	That would make a total of 189,000 words, or approximately 600 pages, which is pretty long. The longer a book is, the more it costs to print, which is why publishers prefer books that are 200-300 pages long. It might be easier to sell if you pared it down to under 300 pages or if you've already been published. Successful writers have an easier time convincing publishers that their manuscripts will be worth the added expense.     I sympathize. One of my novels, a fantasy epic, is over 400 pages. But I've written several other much shorter books. I figure that after I've sold one or two short ones it will be easier for me to sell my fantasy epic. If not, I intend to self-publish it. At least I believe it's worth the added expense.     Good luck!|`|OUmOyjNtaa	Well, 9000 words per chapter, if there are 21 chapters, comes out to 189,000 words, or about 630 pages. So you have 21 chapters, in a 630 book. Personally, I would probably want more chapters, to make it more convenient for me to stop reading from time to time, but it's your book.|`|BYpIQbiRaa	well, I don't think it matters on words per chapter, as long as the story is in total 50000, if you're hoping for it to be a novel, that is.|`|yd8WiPwTaa	I don't think that a word count is really going to say if it is too long. If you convey what you meant to convey in the chapter, its fine. I have read two page chapters and I have read 10-15 page chapters or more. Most readers won't count the number of words, just the pages.|`|VtFIlYWJaa	that is REALLY short. I have 7 chapters so far and i already have more than twice the amount of words you have.|`|byT3CUMoaa	depends. these days because of the cost of paper and ink, publishers are looking for well written books on the short side. if your manuscript is over 200 or so pages long, unless you are an allready published and successful author, you'll have a hard time finding someone to publish it. for me personally? i love long books. go for it.
AA10729675	I agree with all the answers before me.  But I agree with you to keep quiet:  there is a saying in Greek:  lathe biosas.  It means, live with a low profile, escaping the view of others.  I am not saying yu should hide forever, no, no, no.   Only from those people who embarras you and degrade what you like.  So, do not give them this pleasure and do not help them being mean: just don't say what you like.  Look like indifferent to what they say.  In fact, train yourself to not listen to others: you cannot please everyone.  Please yourself.  Enjoy all your feelings and ideas, and dreams.  One day, sister will get married or something and you will finally be able to be with whom you want to be.  Or even alone, just feel fine, and not shy or inferior, or embarrassed.  It is like Mr. Rogers was saying:  Remember I like you just the way you are.    Remember, like yourself, just the way you are.|`|pITh7FBsaa	Paracelsus' motto was "Be not another."|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	You might want to do a 180.  No matter, "To thine own self be true."  Conformity is a harsh prison. I think you can be yourself and be friends with people who completely disagree with you. Let others be others, respect their opinions, no one has a monopoly on truth, not even me. (I believe "lol" os inserted at this point).  People define themselves by their values, if they need to put down another set of values, it means they cannot support their own by rational discourse. Some insecure people can take that to extremes. As long as you can support your set of values with reason, at least to yourself, you have won a victory for yourself.   This is how life is, people like to discuss value systems, some like to hear themselves talk, since their values are the basis of their sense of self, and some like to hear ideas, since they know knowledge gives power.  Be not embarrassed, unless it is for those who cannot tolerate other view points. Being fit is an investment, think of what things will be like in 10 or 20 years, where is the true retard?

People can change 180 (360 would be back where you started,) but it is much harder to change 45 degrees. Do everything the opposite and you are still doing the same thing only now in "rebellion mode." But if whatever has made you a coward up to now is still in you, there is nothing that will stop you from reverting to cowardly ways.    As a coward I can tell you it ain't no trip to Oz, trying to change yourself.    I wish you luck, but I warn you fantasies seldom look the same when you purchase them.
ZOkJmrWwaa	All Broadway theatres are Equity, so you'll have to join that union.  Youre also not likely to do too well without an agent to get you into private casting calls.  But honestly that's all probably several years away before you'll hit that point.      Most everything in Theatre is about who you know, and more importantly who knows you.  You need to build a network of contacts within the theatre worlds, and the only way to do this is to work in it. And this isn't just people who think you're a good actor, but people who have seen and worked with you and know that you're a good worker.  Theatre is a collaborative art, which means EVERYBODY has to give 100% to make a show good.  So few theatres would be willing to cast you if you're a diva, a trouble-maker, or just hard to get along with.      Pick a college carefully.  These teachers should be the ones who teach you what you'll need to know to not only be a good actor, but to succeed at the business.  They should also encourage you to build your resume and also be willing and able to recommend you to their own contacts to get you started in the business.  Try to pick a college in or close to NY if that's where you really want to work, because the teachers you learn from will connect you to their own contacts, and their contacts will be in the region where they work.  Also, before you pick what college you want to go to, visit the campus and talk with the faculty.  Ask them if they work outside the college (because the more they do, the more contacts they'll have to potentially hook you up with)  Also talk with students who go to the school, not just the teachers.  The students will give you the real skinny on what their college is actually like.    While you're in college, go to as many theatre conventions as you can possbily manage.  This is where a ton of people who are successful in theatre will be, and is a marvelous opportunity for you to meet and learn from them (and possibly even impress them!).    If you can dance or sing, (even if it's only a little) make sure to hone these skills too.  An actor who can act, sing, and dance is called a triple threat, and is much more likely to get jobs than somone who can only do one of those things.      Also, work summer stock jobs as much as you can.  Even if they suck.  That's were almost everyone gets started.    Good luck!|`|AA11244364	Apply to do performing arts/theatre/acting/drama at university/drama schools.

TbTO5SXlaa	A double exposure is when you take two pictures on the same frame. A multiple exposure is three or more pictures on the same frame. Back when 35mm film cameras were in use most of them were designed to prevent double or multiple exposures. The same is true with most of today's DSLR cameras.     To do an in-camera double exposure requires using either -1 EV or simply doubling the ISO to prevent over-exposure.    I doubt you'd be able to do a double exposure in-camera with video. You can go to http://www.adorama.com/airc and click on SFX Special Effects for additional information on using Photoshop and see if it addresses video.    Here are examples of my in-camera double and multiple exposures:    http://www.flickr.com/photos/drifter45h/...

CUiNJLWmaa	From Publishers Weekly:    For 12 years, wheelchair-bound restaurateur and Vietnam vet Caney Paxton hasn't left his Sequoyah, Okla., cafe, known (thanks to a sign-maker's error) as the Honk and Holler Opening Soon. Now it's Christmas time, 1985, and for Caney and four-times married waitress Molly O, who helped raise him, the holiday looks bleak: business is slumping, overdue bills are piling up and the roof is leaking. Worried about her teenage daughter, Brenda, a country musician seeking her fortune in Nashville, Molly O is too preoccupied to recognize the romantic interest of cafe regular Life Halstead; Caney, ashamed of his part in the war, feels trapped by his wound and his painful past. But that changes when luck brings the Honk and Holler two new employees: beautiful young Crow Indian drifter Vena Takes Horse, who signs on as a carhop, and Vietnamese refugee Bui Khanh, a cook and handyman running from a guilty secret of his own. Initially skeptical of the two outsiders, Honk and Holler habitu?s come to value Vena and Bui, especially after an act of violence threatens Bui's life. Even a few unresolved loose ends can't diminish the cumulative effect of this warm, sentimental tale, abundant with quirky detail and homespun wisdom, which emphasizes not only the power of romantic love but the healing powers of community as well.|`|yd8WiPwTaa	You can always try actually reading the book.

He marched them all to reservations, mostly in Oklahoma where the soil is terrible and you can't raise much. It was not a fair trade.

The truth is that people only get politically correct after they have what they want. Jackson did what was best for the growth of the nation.

Not many people would pick a tent over a modern home with furniture, television, appliances, etc  Advanced civilizations always rule. Primitives always take the back seat.

What it does take is a person down on their luck and in need of financial assistance.      Why do I give to beggars?  Because they, too, are human beings and in need of food and clothing.  I like to believe that I have compassion for my fellow human beings and have in some small way made a difference. I can't explain it any better than that.

It's also good because it raises questions with the audience and can be made humourous as well. Brecht is always a good one to go with because his plays are a bit different and you can go into all his theories on theatre and performance if you need to talk about context if it's for a graded piece.    Arthur Miller's good to go with as well, maybe A View From The Bridge, or The Crucible as has already been mentioned, or maybe Tennessee Williams.|`|GzErdlOaaa	i agree with the first answer
TxUZeo2oaa	wow this monologue is really interesting. I suggest you dress like younger kid, bright colors say a lot. When you are speaking this make sure to keep a strong stand. (2 feet on the ground don't cross your legs over each other.. that shows weakness) Maybe wear a necklace and grab on to it when speaking "I go to Paris and buy lots of jewelry and fancy clothes" you can honestly do so much with this passage. Props might be harder.. but remember it's a little kid imagining she had all those things... she doesn't actually have them. you could pretend you are flashing pictures with a camera, driving a big car, and putting on makeup, because that is what kids do.. they pretend.    these are just my suggestions.|`|AA11244364	Play it as a kid. Start really bored. Don't rush any of it, use the punctuation to help you. Each time you change idea, change your posture and your tone of voice, really get into each part... Remember that the character is thinking of everything on the spot and doesn't know what they're going to say next. Build it up to get more and more excited about each person your character wants to be so that by the time you get to the end, your audience is sure it's going to get really exciting... And then it's a complete anti-climax, which if played right should get a good laugh, so really take your time over that end bit.

Q49d8oD1aa	so, I do NOT like Twilight, and being a "hater", these are my reasons:  Bella is a classic Mary-Sue and she has no personality...  (she is pretty without trying and she doesn't think she is, she is overly smart, she is the "ordinary girl")  Edward is "flawless and godlike", he also does not have any depth...  the books were written poorly and SM uses a lot of the same adjectives throughout the entire series...  the books are basically purple prose...  there are many plot holes in the book, because SM didn't think them over enough...  the plot itself is cheesy and unoriginal...  (eg: she is the new girl and immediately all of the guys fall in love with her, as does the "hottest" most "unattainable guy"..)  the vampires are hardly vampires...(sparkling instead of burning)  Bella and Edward's love is at first purely physical...(Bella smells good, Edward looks good)  the books sends bad messeges to teenagers:  Twilight: "yes, it is OK for guys to stalk you, watching you in your sleep"  New Moon: "without guys, teenage girls will spiral into suicide"  Eclipse: " it is OK to try and commit suicide for the one you love"  Breaking Dawn: "girls should get pregnent and married at a young age"  anyone who doeesn't like the main character is "bad" (eg: Rosalie)  there is no originality in the story (how many vampire-mortal love stories have there been?...many, many, many...)  how Bella seems to need Edward every-second-of-every day...  naming the character Bella Swan is so clich...   there is also Edward's stalking issues...  real couples aren't like Bella and Edward in real life...(love isn't like that)  the ending was too perfect...(she led the story to a big climax, then the main characters talked it over, and went home...she couldn't bear to kill of her main characters...)    it's also the fans as well...  there is a whole hoard of screaming fangirls, who probably only like the books for Edward...(and yes I know that what I just said is a blanket statement, I know that not all fans are obsessive, teenage girls, but most of the Twilight fans on Y!A are)  the fangirls are vicious and just as cruel (crueler) as the "haters"  hearing about Twilight 24/7 will drive anyone who is not a fan up the wall...  and it's annoying when Twilight-fans can't understand why I don't like the series....  and it's kinda scary watching the obsessive people give answers in this section...  (eg: some girl answered a question saying something like: "NO WAY! EDWARD'S MINE! HE'S GONNA PUT HIS BABIES IN ME, AND I'M GONNA PUSH THEM OUT THOUGH MY BIRTH CANAL!!!")    another thing that I don't like is when Twilight fans compare Harry Potter to Twilight, then say that Twilight is better...  Being a Harry Potter fan, I really don't like that, seeing as Harry Potter is one of my favorite series, and Twilight is...not...    I don't hate the books because they are popular...I have read the books...okay?  It really is annoying when people say that the only reason that "haters" don't like Twilight is because they are too popular or because they haven't read the books...    to the people who say that Twilight takes them to another world:  this always happens with all the books I read...Twilight was no different, every book I have ever read has been an escape from reality, it's not just Twilight...|`|Th3bifTWaa	Too many reasons for why I don't like it .

There's more than that, like the fact that is doesn't have traditional vampires, which makes it different(though my friend begs to differ...he hates Twilight because it doesn't have a classic vampire!) it makes everything different, which makes it it's own world, not the world of Dracula, set in another time, or some other series! It's made me want to be an author when I grow up, and is one of the reasons I still love to read.|`|5X9kaIOXaa	i really enjoy the books. they take me away to a place that does not exist and when i want to escape from my life for a little, it is really easy to get sucked into this book.    what i dislike are the extreme fans. they bother me A LOT. their obsession is to a very high degree that i feel is far too much. and also, reading it makes me depressed about my own life lol.|`|rdGjW2Hbaa	I love it because of all the passion and the exhilarating suspense!   i love it cause Edward (the lead male role + vampire) is what all girls want and i don't mean to dream and fall all over for i mean like a perfect gentlemen. Well and Bella is just an ordinary clumsy, danger magnet girl. She gets herself all up in this trouble because of Edward and the fact of him being a vampire and everything. It has forbidden love and is so real that you feel like your actually there watching it happen. Whenever she gets embarrassed you just can't read but you have too cause it kills you to not. and when things go wrong and is just so sad and is so excruciating that you cry it's just so beautiful!.

Body. The material or physical organism of man. The living electrochemical mechanism of animal nature and origin.              2. Mind. The thinking, perceiving, and feeling mechanism of the human organism. The total conscious and unconscious experience. The intelligence associated with the emotional life reaching upward through worship and wisdom to the spirit level.              3. Spirit. The divine spirit that indwells the mind of man--the Thought Adjuster. This immortal spirit is prepersonal--not a personality, though destined to become a part of the personality of the surviving mortal creature.              4. Soul. The soul of man is an experiential acquirement. As a mortal creature chooses to "do the will of the Father in heaven," so the indwelling spirit becomes the father of a new reality in human experience. The mortal and material mind is the mother of this same emerging reality. The substance of this new reality is neither material nor spiritual--it is morontial. This is the emerging and immortal soul which is destined to survive mortal death and begin the Paradise ascension.

LANDIS    Birth:   20 Aug 1878 ,Lancaster, Pennsylvania    Marriage:  Abt 1902     Elizabeth BENTZ        Birth:   1884 Lancaster, Pennsylvania     Death:   1952      http://www.masonicinfo.com/33rdsrule.htm     There are only three  degrees of Masonry:     Entered Apprentice     Fellowcraft     **Master Mason --the HIGHEST degree in Masonry.    In fact, there's NO RANKING in the number system whatsoever - except that in order to become a 2nd Degree Mason, you must first be a 1st Degree Mason - etc. However, a person who has received the 12th Degree of the Scottish Rite degree system is not particularly 'higher' in rank or stature: they've just received MORE DEGREES. If one becomes a Mark Master Mason in the York Rite system, they've received an additional degree. That's it. Nothing more and nothing less.      Scottish Rite--has an degree system consisting of thirty-two degrees. The first three of those are only conferred by 'Scottish Rite Craft Lodges' of which there are very, very few worldwide - with most unrecognized. The 4th through the 32nd degrees (all of which have names that vary from Scottish Rite Jurisdiction to Scottish Rite Jurisdiction) are conferred upon those who make application AND PAY TO RECEIVE THEM!     One simply signs a petition and hands in a very reasonable amount of money (cash, check or credit card!) and they're on their way to being a 32nd Degree Scottish Rite Mason at the next degree class. While some parts of the world have time and service limitations for each individual degree in the series causing perhaps a 10 year delay from beginning to end, in the United States you can walk into a high school auditorium or some other location where the conferrals are being held and, after a suitable luncheon break, leave in the late afternoon having all of the 'secrets' of the 4th through the 32nd Degrees of the Scottish Rite.     The 33rd ("and last") Degree of the Scottish Rite is an honorary degree, conferred for exceptional service to Freemasonry.     The YORK Rite Bodies is  broken into four (in some places, three) 'groupings' and a member is free to stop at the conclusion degree of any of those 'groupings'. SCOTTISH  Rite, however, assumes a progression from their first (4th) degree through their final (32nd) degree and often offer all in a 'class' setting which ensures all degrees will be conferred on all candidates with none stopping at, for example, the 18th. Thus, the highest award for the Scottish Rite Bodies has no publicly recognizable comparison at the Knight Templar level of the York Rite (although certainly their recognitions are no less meaningful to the York Rite member recipient).     The recipient of the 33rd Degree, being rightly proud of the distinct honor, would append that after his name in virtually all Masonic communication. This was reinforced by the fact that a 33rd would regularly and proudly wear a ring emblematic of that distinction (a gold band, about 5/16th of an inch wide, blue triangle on one side with a gold number 33) which caused yet another noticeable distinction from (as non-Masons might perceive it) 'run of the mill' Masons. Traditionally, the inside of the ring bears the inscription "Virtus junxit mores non separabit", "Whom virtue unites, death will not separate."     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job's_Daugh...      The purpose of the organization is to band together young girls who are related to a MASTER MASON.     (So, going by the above sentence alone, Franklin would have had to be a Master Mason in order for you to be in Job's Daughters)|`|UQTAN7cgaa	if you know what state he lived in (assuming the USA) contact the Grand Lodge of that state, explain what you are trying to do and they will be happy to help you. they can provide a record of his masonic career on a nice document that can be framed.    if you need help finding the grand lodge, please email me.|`|gb1BGP8xaa	When and where did he live?

HORACAnlaa	The philosophical meaning is that all progress, joy, and success is found by the individual. There is no collective mind so each individual needs to use his/her own mind to understand the world. To defer to others the power of your individual mind is to give them a mortgage over your soul. All political systems that deny the individual the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness are fundamentally flawed. The purpose of life is each individual's happiness and no one may deny you this right. Or has another Rand character put it in another novel: I swear, by my life and my love of it, that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.|`|cxDbdhELaa	The reason why you do not understand what this "miniature tome" imparts is because you've never had to live and suffer under the yoke of a political system based upon the collective imperative (ie, Communism).  Nor, have you had to watch as throngs of others suffered while you enjoyed an existence based upon individual liberty.    After WW2, and up until only about ten or twenty years ago, a good percentage of the world was subjected to the misery of collectivism.  Ayn Rand grew up within such a system and that experience, along with her individual spirit, galvanized her philosophical outlook.    She would go on to become one of history's greatest champions of the individual spirit, using her intellectual capacity to philosophically justify this position as being the only natural and true essence of mankind.    "Anthem" is the most distilled down of all her writings to express her philosophy of the individual.|`|yTKEBRuAaa	Why you don't understand?  Ayn Rand is famous for her philosophical belief which is "Objectivism", which is what all her books are about.  You should also read her book "The Fountainhead" to supplement your understanding of the author and her philosophy. :)|`|TI06IsACaa	The answer above fits for the most part. I'm studying Ayn Rand's philosophy now.     Anthem mostly shows the destructive power of collectivism (altruism.....working for your neighbors above yourself) and how it rejects the individual and reasoning mind as a means to happiness. In the book, the word "I" is banned and all men are slaves to their neighbors. The state of the society has fallen back to ancient times where all modern technology and inventions have been lost. This is the state of the world when collectivism rules. This is a philosophical statement against altruism.    She then shows the power of the philosophy based on the reasoning mind and being an individual (independent) through the street sweepers and the golden one. They seek their own interests in exploring their world and invention. They also show the joy that can be had when having selfish love. They get banned for their selfish actions and defying the societies rules. They build a far more advanced society away from the collective one. This is the philosophical statement for reason and independence.    If you want a full statement of her philosophical statement in the book, i would recommend reading over the speech at the end, about the precious word I. That speech sums up the philosophical statement made in the book about the individual. The state of the society and what i described above is her statement against the collective.    You are lucky that you've been exposed to Rand's work early. I recommend The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged if you liked it.    Edit.....For the answerer below me...how does your hate of Rand's philosophy make a description of her philosophy a thumbs down? I dont thumbs down explanations of Kant's or Hegel's philosophy. The goal was to explain her statement in a book.....its sick that you came to the question just to add nothing and put down her philosophy.|`|vqJVj83Paa	It's pretty sick that they're feeding kids Ayn Rand in school...    I can't qualify my statements further than saying beware of Rand and the kind of ideology she is associated with. You've been warned...

Moral intuition, the realization of duty, is a component of human mind endowment and is associated with the other inalienables of human nature: scientific curiosity and spiritual insight. Man's mentality  Page 192-8    At first only the spirit of intuition could function in the instinctive and reflex behavior of the primordial animal life. With the differentiation of higher types, the spirit of understanding was able to endow such creatures with the gift of spontaneous association of ideas. Later on we observed the spirit of courage in operation; evolving animals really developed a crude form of protective self-consciousness. Subsequent to the appearance of the mammalian groups, we beheld the spirit of knowledge manifesting itself in increased measure. And the evolution of the higher mammals brought the function of the spirit of counsel, with the resulting growth of the herd instinct and the beginnings of primitive social development.

We all should pay more attention to them.|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	It is part of our animal nature. Instead of reasoning through an issue from point a to be to c to d, gut feelings can bring us directly from point a to point d. Sometimes we will not be able to take the time or effort to reason through something. Our ability to make a gut decision is very important with regard to our survival. This is not to say that all gut decisions are right. However one may find oneself in a situation that is very cloudy (a situation with many variables), yet your gut gives you a straight black and white answer to the problem (fight, flight etc.).|`|xsZfN0JHaa	gut feelings equals a hunch. Some people use the gut feelings and end up doing the wrong thing. Basically a person reason out things. even the reason seems right can be wrong.

Whether a 'gut feeling' is right or wrong depends on the situation and how you choose to act upon it.

fbd87c7846199694ba9130c99b6e261caa	I admire your determination but I highly recommend if you are just starting out in theatre to do only one show at a time. Even if the shows have different run dates and audition dates you can almost guarantee their will be a conflict in rehearsal dates and missing out on rehearsals is never a good thing. As an actor it is better to commit yourself completely to one role then to spread yourself too thin. You already will have lines, songs, dances, etc to work on for one show, you do not want to short change yourself on one because you have too much to work on at once.     If the auditions have yet to occur absolutely audition for both. That way if you don't get into one you may still have a chance of getting into the other. However if you are cast in both plays you will need to make a decision on which show to do.|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	if you can handle i think its ok  but i think its the best that you do one at a time  because each company will expect that   you are giving your everything to that production  also they usually will have extra practice dates   and if one overlaps they are not going to be happy  and you are going to have to decide which to go to.  one play is also very draining so two would be even more so.  i think you should know what you are getting into   before making any decisions but i dont think it is a great idea  i think you should do a class thats focus is to have you learn something  and not just to put on a play|`|G3kteHr1aa	I think that you should do whatever you think you can handle. The most important thing is whether you are having fun. Enjoying it is more important than building your resume quickly. Rehearsals can be pretty demanding so just make sure you will have time to dedicate to both. I have often felt overwhelmed doing one at a time but it all depends.|`|U9FHuNeBaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!|`|AA11244364	I'm currently doing two shows at once, and it's fine apart from the fact that I have to miss a couple of rehearsals for one of them while the other one takes priority. Make sure you inform the directors if you're going to have to miss any rehearsals in advance, and before you audition for a lead ask about any extra rehearsals; with one of my shows the leads are called for extra weekend rehearsals, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into!    At the end of the day, it's better to do one show well than two half-heartedly and you don't want to wear yourself out, especially if you're not used to rehearsing and performing regularly.
9zOh1Nleaa	it's lovely. my warmest wishes to you and your family during this time. continue to write. it is a wonderful way to vent and increase your talent. if you would like someone to talk to, you can email me. i know it isn't easy. it is nice to find friends where you can in hard times. i also love reading writers new work so it would be a pleasure.|`|yJCLcFVwaa	Your Grandma does hear you and you can follow her as she has given you an example to follow. God Bless you.|`|2z1h5mfOaa	I like most of it. Actually I find it quite emotional because of the every-day detail you bring in it like her toast and what she has to eat, and how she eats it "like a priest".  I think you need to work on it a bit more, e.g. I would leave out the "a" in front of "tuna spread on butter" and in front of "chocolate with softness of silk".  "Its how tender to watch her" doesn't sound right or make sense to me. (And by the way, it should be "it's" rather than "its" also in two lines above.)  There are a few other things to correct...  I was surprised to read you call her oma, as this is a Flemish/Dutch and even German way of calling your grandma - my children call my mother oma...  I loved that.  Just keep working at it.  It's a lovely piece of writing.   My thoughts are with you, especially if your grandma is dying.

yHWkQs9Paa	First, she's complaining about Hermia, her competitor for Demetrius's love. She's saying that everyone else thinks she's just as pretty as Hermia, but Demetrius loves Hermia anyway. And she says it's pretty stupid for him to love her. Then she's talking about how Demetrius used to love her before Hermia came along ("For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne..."). Then, she decides to tell Demetrius of Hermia's plan to run away with Lysander, because she thinks it will make Demetrius fall in love with her again.

However, Iceland is in trouble, and without help from neighbors (and that means, mainly Norway) they would have been bankrupt now.     So they are in a way trying to discuss with the EU. They also discuss common currency with Norway, but this is a bit difficult, because Norwegian economy is very influenced by Norway been an oil-exporter, and Iceland is not. So it depends on the Icelanders only want the benefits, and not are willing to actually pay anything, or not. My guess is nothing will happen.
e4tvh1d2aa	not nessasarily an abstraction  but it is all stimulus and reaction.  our desions are pre-weighted before the time to make them by  our previous situations and social and customary rules  as well as the personality that also consists of the behaviors learned  from self defence with all situations you were in before.  this does not make thinking abstract other than the most superficial sense.  as i once heard but no longer rememeber who said it  "we as humans have discoverd nothing, only re-discovered them"  when we think upon a subject and it becomes a know truth  but it was still in effect before we created the thought.  the thoughts are real the subjects are real and the emotions and outcomes are still very real, just already set to a path  that we can not see
WELHdIjFaa	Defiantly. They inspired the world, at the time Great Britain was the top dog, and if some lowly colonists could defeat the British then the rest of the world could rebel.    French Revolution is one example|`|Jj30buLMaa	What?...no, no it wasn't, some maybe. In fact I'd say that the American revolution was in probably many ways modelled on the French Revolution.  Which was also successful if a bit messier then the Americans|`|XWvD81COaa	Yes, it was the first revolution that was actually successful.
Tj2xROpwaa	I think so far mine are Jacob and Seth and Leah. I can relate to Leah a lot because she is strong and independent and caring.  I have read half of the 4th book so I still have the last half to go...Jacob kinda got annoying in his first person narrative but he is getting less annoying now. :)|`|wsCBo2Zkaa	Its gotta be Jacob so i like Seth and Leah as well, But Jacob is my fave werewolf. Lisa Michelle x x lol x x|`|ifYOXajoaa	I do think Seth and Quil are really good and funny, sweet characters from New Moon........... ecspeacilly Seth . he is so sweet!!     Yeah.

But i think it so sad what Sam did to his wife( cant think of name.)  I really dont have a favorite because im only on the Third one.|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	I like seth. he's a sweetheart.    leah is a biotch.|`|WYrYptMbaa	Your right, Leah's story is sad.   :(  Her and Jacob are my favs. of course,|`|FE4B8uynaa	I would say Jacob because hes and *** but funny too.

9WuqMoDqaa	A hurt child and an angry one are two completely different things. My mom wouldnt care if some boy I didnt like kissed me. If some boy broke my hand, though...|`|AA12160009	The thing I hate about Jacob,and these thoughs went through my mind as well, was that he really is super agressive. I mean he just breaks her hand and even though Charlie is nice to Edward, it doesn't really mean he favors him. He loves Jacob, like the son he never had but just treat them both the same. I mean, that comment was just unecessary and I'm pissed about that. God, I feel the same way!|`|BpcAVgEeaa	Ugh, I cannot stand those books.|`|w2IzpkNlaa	yes|`|tCyn8EbHaa	yup same feelings|`|I0G597aAaa	chill it's just a book T.T"|`|NqYfsGHIaa	It's just a book...    Charlie acts that way because he dislikes Edward and was trying to make it very clear, hoping it would detour Bella from seeing him.  He wants her to go with Jake because Bella and Jake basically grew up together...both of their father's are long-time friends. That's why Charlie approves more of Jake than of Edward.

XHvjwu0kaa	Well first you could practice in front of a mirror for a while and then after you memorized the lyrics call up your friends and have them bring over some of their friends. This way you will have an audience to perform in front of. With all that practice you'll be ready to perform on stage. Before your performance occupy yourself with other tasks instead of thinking about the performance. The more you think about the lyrics right before your performance the more prone you'll be to forgetting them. When your on stage take a few deep breaths to relax yourself. Then don't look at the audience, it will only make you more nervous, just look past them. I also remember an old teacher of mine telling me that by holding your hand over your belly button you will be lest nervous because that is were your umbilical cord was and that's were you basically got your nutrition.

Only advice I can give you is this; When the world throws  challenges at you such as this, the feeling of loneliness, you  need to do nothing more than challenge it back. You'll never  get through it if you don't embrace it. So embrace this horrible  feeling, and you'll get through it. It will take time. I've been alone  my whole life. And even when I'm not alone, I still feel alone. I face  issues of depression, have my whole life. But I am learning to embrace  it, it's the only way I'll ever get out alive. I suggest you to do  the same thing. Everything in the world is against people. against youth, media is, music is, everything is. So just face it. This is the world  we were given, be strong enough to carry it out.  Good luck|`|bCkw8E8faa	GET A DOG...|`|J6cq8j9jaa	Depending on your age why don't you consider joining the military.

8L0isASeaa	HOLY S !T. Your story plot and the beginning sound exactly like my story. The main character also has an older brother; his name is Alexei, in other words, the Russian variant of Alex. And the main character is as well a female except her name is Juliet. And both were spoken about in prophecy. and they are both of the paranormal world. this is just creepy. The preface I wrote for the story begins almost the same way. Same question of "why is this girl telling me this?". Same sarcasm. Dear God. This is too creepy. Too many similarites for this to be coincidental. But enough of my ranting.  Your story(though sounds a bit like mine) is very interesting. I enjoyed the beginning but with all the "great-great-greats", I kind of got tired of it and skipped over it. My editor(the creative writing teacher at my school, lame I know) gave me a tip and told me to let the audience slowly emerge into the story, dont shove so many supernatural facts down their throats. other than that, good job.   hope and glad I helped. :]|`|xzZYf2X5aa	pretty good!! i like the topic|`|GXKCtmLraa	what part is it u need help?|`|VZFEB85Iaa	Mi corozon es tuyo|`|F6UjKPSDaa	Great story.!Could use a little more like.WOW!!!!Other than that i like ur story.I would buy it

It was better than the poems I read in english class.  How long did that take you?  I can't concentrate like that.  I write my poems in about 5 minutes, and they are usually free verse.  You are very talented.
O15my3olaa	Generally good, but would be more interesting and convincing if you could include some statistics -- numbers killed in genocides and wars(both soldiers and civilians), numbers of soldiers becoming mentally unstabled after wars and needed drugs, etc. Some of the scenes/texts need to be slowed down a bit for viewer to absorb properly.     Peace could be attained esp when education and food resources globally are enhanced, and people stop discriminating against others colour, creed, ideology or culture. And if the top leaders of the world in govts and business are not arrogant or greedy or plain 'crazy' dictators.    Best of luck on your project, and Peace be with you, your family, etc!|`|FoIxsunVaa	Unfortunately, I am typing on an abacus, and the beads don't play sound.     But peace, world peace, calmness, inner chill, are goals that are a lot more interesting to talk about than to put up with.    No we don't all necessarily want peace. Peaceniks are confused individuals.|`|w6DJj1a8aa	this is something since i was 5 years old i never understood and i ask sooo many questions to my grandmother why are people starving why ???? i'm still asking this question why????? and i still don't understand and i'm 24 years old and they always say it's not that simple and easy when i think it is!|`|ugKQuggFaa	I thought that was a very good video but I think you should show it to your teacher first just to be safe!
Ow3O7h4caa	The set still sells for roughly $900 to $1300 depending on the demand. That is what makes the price go up or down. With an overall condition of 9/10, that is pretty clean.  On e-bay, they are selling the head alone for $300 to $450 with an 8/10 condition. Base yourself on that.    What I am worried about is that if they have to change the tubes, that can run to $200. That is what may affect the pricing.|`|T3xVvf3naa	Tubes should still be fine if not gigged loud twice a week.
10bde24c95fa630a79d9c75bd022b054aa	I agree with you. I may be a guy and all, but before anyone pulls that card out against me, I do write romance so I have some idea what I'm talking about.    The way I look at things, romance can be categorized into two categories: short stories consisting of only a few chapters and long novels. When it comes to shorter stories, it is kinda necessary to focus on the romance, since you only have a short amount of time to get that point to the reader and influence them. There can be tiny outside plots, but they need not to be important or else they will completely overshadow the whole point of the story.    Meanwhile, when it comes to a novel length romance, I find that the best stories usually have an external conflict that, on the surface, doesn't truly comply with the romantic relationship, but does have an influence on what happens. In this type of story, you need not to overwhelm the reader with the relationship.    From what I've seen, Meyer takes strategies from the former type of story and applies it to the latter. She overdoes the romance between the two characters rather than focusing on any plot outside of them. All the conflicts are very shallow and not very well written, which takes away from the potential that the story has.    Really, I find it a romance that does not live up to its potential.|`|4ZjWUjv6aa	they are the main characters|`|krKMYVbFaa	Well, the book is about Edward and Bella so... I'm kinda glad she did write about them.|`|a7iuLw4Kaa	well um....that's what the book is all about. EDWARD AND BELLA.|`|FE4B8uynaa	Lol that because the book is about mainly them. Everyone else is a sidekick basically. Like Romeo and Juliet, the story was all about them. Love stories usually are.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	Sorry but you're a moron. Those are the main characters.    The other thing that focuses too much on them is TWEEN TWITTERS like yourself.|`|RAPeNncwaa	because stephanie meyer, as stephan king says, can't write worth a ****.|`|GK00Rz5caa	I don't mind the author focusing on Edward and Bella, but I wouldn't mind Stephenie focusing more on the others as well.|`|r6pFd5Fwaa	ok. the whole book is based on them. if your not into romance novels why would you read it??? HELLLLLOOOO!|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Well since they are the MAIN characters..|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	clearly, darling, you've never been in love.    the edward/bella scenes are my favorite out of any in the whole book. they're the reason I read the twilight series.    if you want action, rent "Die Hard."|`|4npjIcPaaa	i know! i couldn't finish twilight because it got too mushy. just get to the action dude! i couldn't even read new moon because bella was being so ungrateful and winey. it was painful. & i also dont like that edward asks her a million times if shes scared of him. i mean just get over it you are not scary edward !|`|Jx3TG0keaa	THE BOOKS ABOUT THERE LOVE GENIUS!!!!!!!!|`|20c2c6644deaac7c727eaaa024e9a36aaa	lol thats why Stephen King slammed the author of Twilight whatever her name is.    I think the whole book in general is annoying.|`|cpepmfD9aa	Yes, it gets tiring after a while. She makes it seem like the whole world revolves around them. I know that's what the books are about, but a person is defined by more than who they love. Even when she writes about werewolves it somehow links back to how perfect Bella and Edward are together. Bella really doesn't care about her friends that much.|`|EetbWnxHaa	don't look so much into it.  the books are about edward and bella's relationship, and that's why most people like it.  Most fans LIKE that its about them every two seconds, i know i do.|`|jbYqydH7aa	Yes.Even thoguh I am a fan...She does focus too much on them.We get it...They are in love...sex...blah.blah.blah!|`|AAhwOj6Daa	Um i have no idea but twilight, in my opinion, is pretty gay|`|KK3R6CjYaa	Who cares, It's a book (a wonderful book in fact)  Get over it.   I meen since it's a book of course the author isn't going to sit there telling the readers about the characters about them sitting in there room reading a book or or eating a bowl of cereal.  The whole book is supposed to be about bella and edward so that's what she talks about, Not about the boring stuff they do at home.   She only focuses on the main parts..|`|7hfbQTxjaa	*GASP* you just gave me yet another reason to hate Twilight! YAY!    EDIT: I should probably say that in a good book, the author makes ALL the people in it important, not just focusing on the main people. the reader wants (or should, at least) to know what is happening with everyone, sure the main people might be interesting and important, but they really should NOT be the only people in the book that matter!|`|3a8e968728b8c9b42046c8b83c563c22aa	Yes i do agree with you twilight focuses more on edward and bella which is kind of annoying because its not like their the only characters in the book that probably makes the book interesting for many SHALLOW teens.|`|jzdDF3Ljaa	Uhm no you are not the only one.  Basically all boys and not little girly-girl girls are sick of it.  Heh.  One of my teachers is a little girly-girl :)    I really dont see why they love each other so much, either.  They barely met and they already love each other.    It'd be nice if the book had an ending where Bella realizes what a dope she is and her friends save her from being in love with mr.perfect, and it turns out mr.perfect was just using her.  Also this happens after Bella and edward have sex and Bella is really into the relationship, and then she finds out edward did this to all the pretty girls, and he wanted Bella to keep their relationship secretish so he could have lots of hot chicks.  It also turns out Edward wasnt a vampire he was just a freak who lied so he would seem cooler, and he did everything with smoke and mirrors.     It'd be better if edward WAS a skank, and the book midnight sun exposed him LOL  of course if that was the case, I'd like it if the first 3 books were shorter..|`|khwFE2fUaa	well they are the main characters!!|`|AA11547888	Well...the book IS about Bella and Edward. It's wrapped around their irrevocable love for each other, their passion. So YES, it's going to focus on them. They did not make out every two seconds. The part where "Edward has no life"...this has to do with the passion they have for each other. Their life IS EACH OTHER. That's how much they love each other, they LIVE for each other. That's the whole thing about this story...they can't live without each other (as in Romeo and Juliet)...so until they can HAVE each other, it's gonna be all about them BEING with each other as much as possible. That's LOVE. You may feel uncomfortable with this idea, which is why you rightfully stopped reading the books. When you come across this person you can't be without, your life becomes THEM. And for a while, you have no life besides THEM.

Some free alternatives are Paint.NET and Gimp or Gimpshop.    http://www.getpaint.net/    http://www.gimpshop.com/      While not as good as the downloadable programs, some good web-based online image editors are SumoPaint, Pheonix, Splashup and e Pixlr.    http://www.sumopaint.com/web/    http://aviary.com/tools/phoenix    http://www.splashup.com/    http://www.pixlr.com/      ArtWeaver is a free alternative to Corel Painter:    http://www.artweaver.de/index.php?en_ver...      There are also some programs you can use that try to help making comics easier. Manga Studio is a popular choice for black and white comics. However, it's pretty pricey.      There's also TokyoPop's Manga Creator:    It's much much cheaper than Manga Studio, and easier to use. The dowside is that it has less features. It's up to you what you'd want to spring for.    http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/t...    There's also Comic Book Creator 2, which is fairly cheap. Which usually means, easy to use but low on advanced features:    http://www.myplanetwide.com/products/det...    It's up to you to find out exactly what these programs can do and decide whether it's worth paying for that extra functionality.    If you're on a Mac, there's Comics Life. If you already have an older Mac it should be on your computer already, I think. If it's not, you can download a demo here (There's a PC version as well):    http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/im...|`|Jj8RdwQcaa	Deleter Comicworks is an excellent software for creating comics/manga.

GOOD LUCK HONEY!|`|2UtkBvvvaa	Oh, I know exactly how you feel.  You should do flexibility exercises every day to regain your flexibility (Search on google, they have a huge range which I'm sure will help)  Here's a tip: The best time to do the splits is in the morning. As soon as you wake up, get out of bed and try going straight into the splits. This is when your body is still quite numb, so it's a lot easier and doesn't cause as much pain.  Good luck, I'm sure you can do it!  If you need anymore help, feel free to email me. =)
AA10403253	Boo is actually the one who stabs Bob Ewell to save the children.    Heck Tate, the sheriff, says Bob 'fell on his own knife' to spare Boo from any trials (for killing Bob) and also shading him from the limelight, because the ladies of the town would be going up to the door to commend him for saving the children.    Atticus thought Jem was the culprit, but it was actually Boo. Bob did not fall on his own knife. The knife Heck Tate was carrying was Bob's knife, because Boo's knife was in Bob's body.

Learn to spell, too, if you want people to respect you.|`|AA11053540	I hate to point out the obvious: that is, approximately 20% of people born are NOT the children of the husband of their mother! In olden times, there was no doubt who the mother was. Now-a-days, hospitals routinely mix up babies, babies are sent home with the wrong mother, and 1/5 of mothers played hanky-panky and their husband was not the father of the child.  So, people, give me a break: don't say that old records were less reliable. Actually, they were more reliable. There were no "mix-ups", because the babies were born at home, just as I was.

He is in the Crapshooter's Ballet, Luck Be A Lady and Sit Down You're Rockin' The Boat.  He does have a few spoken lines and is generally the "tough guy" of the show, carrying a gun in a shoulder holster.  He has a fight with Sky (I think - could be Nathan!) and plays a particularly dubious dice game, using his own dice from which he has had the spots removed (for "luck"!) but "remembers where the spots formerly was"!  The part can be played almost like he's a cartoon character - I've seen it done that way and it worked really well.|`|K4lxdAa2aa	Yes he does sing.

aa1QzDyWaa	Flashlight Powder Blitzlichtpulver or flashlight powder was invented in Germany in 1887 by Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke. Lycopodium powder (the waxy spores from club moss) was used in early flash powder.    Flashbulbs The first modern photoflash bulb or flashbulb was invented by Austrian, Paul Vierkotter. Vierkotter used magnesium-coated wire in an evacuated glass globe. Magnesium-coated wire was soon replaced by aluminum foil in oxygen. On September 23, 1930, the first commercially available photoflash bulb was patented by German, Johannes Ostermeier. These flashbulbs were named the Vacublitz. General Electric produded a flashbulb called the Sashalite.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Odyssey is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. The poem was probably written near the end of the eighth century BC, somewhere along the Greek-controlled western present day Turkey seaside, Ionia. The poem is, in part, a sequel to Homer's Iliad and mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus (or Ulysses, as he was known in Roman myths) and his long journey home to Ithaca following the fall of Troy.    http://www.bookrags.com/Odyssey    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/od/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/odyssey/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/odyssey/index....    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Athena guides Telmakhoss ship away from the suitors ambush.  He had been in danger form the suitors.    From Shmoop/Telemakhos' timeline|`|R5UIMBvcaa	Just before he leaves and when he comes back. One of Athena's reasons for sending him on that wild goose chase* seems to be to get him OUT of danger.  Once he has made a formal complaint to the Council (at her instigation) about the suitors' illegal behavior, they realize that he has become a force to be reckoned with,  and he's scarcely off the island before they begin making plans to kill him when he returns.  So when he does return, Athena warns him  not to land at the port near the palace but to land on the other side of the island and go to Eumaeus' hut, so that he still takes the suitors somewhat by surprise.    On the journey itself, however, he's never in any particular danger--calm seas and welcoming hosts all the way.    *Yes, I know, Athena has some positive reasons for sending him on that journey, but finding Odysseus isn't one of them.  Odysseus is west of Ithaca, and she sends Telemachus east.

Many of the European nations signed alliance treaties with each other stating that if one was attacked the others would jump in. When a Serbian assassinated Archduke Ferdinand of Austria Hungary, they wanted revenge and Germany had signed an alliance with Austria. So it was similar to if they were attacked themselves. They put demands on Serbia that Serbia was clearly not going to meet. Austria and Germany are very similar in that their language is the same and much of their ethnic origins are the same. Most people in Europe thought the war be over in a short time so the attitude was sort of "let's hurry up and kick some a**."

IGZ130U6aa	I think this poem speaks to the predisposition we all have of ascribing unflattering motives to our fellows when they are somehow regarded by others for something noble or heroic. In a very few simple words the poem is making a statement about the darker, baser side of human nature. There is a darker cynical side to the narrator's questions and a hint of a somewhat skewed motive behind the supposedly noble action of the "he" in the poem, suggesting that he lets them fall so he can catch them and thus gain their high esteem.|`|MilWQufkaa	i think its pretty good if you're not trying to be fancy with words. Despite what it lacks in textual qualities, i found it to be quite decent with regards to the central theme. It wasnt too hard to pick up. Basically I found the poem to be saying that the writer becomes frustrated when people praise god. The writer asks why does god let them "fall" or why do bad things happen. They or "christians" reply, so that god may catch them again, thus showing them that he is there for them. Something along the lines of that. Thats how i interpreted it.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	I think it's lacking in substance. You could add a few more lines to clarify things more, but then again mystery is part of what makes poems interesting. Hard to say for sure.

What letters are you talking about? the link you provide just has a Ted Hughes poem and a few website posts. No letters.    Question 2 is really easy. It's just a list of the objects in the poem and then you think about what connects them.    Wind    This house has been far out at sea all night,  The woods crashing through darkness, the booming hills,  Winds stampeding the fields under the window  Floundering black astride and blinding wet    sky   hills wind    lens of a mad eye.   house-side a  coal-house door.    wind  balls of my eyes  tent of the hills  guyrope,    fields  the skyline a grimace,  magpie   gull  iron bar . The house    Okay, I just did it for the first few stanzas, you do it for the rest.  Right away, there are some things that are intangible (can't be touched), like wind, sky, and skyline. And then there are things that are very concrete (easy to visualize and touch), like a magpie, a house, a coal-house door.    So you could make an argument that he's contrasting intangible things with the very basic things we see everyday around us. Maybe he's helping to make the intangible...tangible. Who knows?    One of the great things about reading poetry is that your idea can't be wrong - you just have to support it well. So no matter what interpretation you come up with, it will be right as long as you can defend it.|`|Th3bifTWaa	I'm sorry, all those pleas distracted me from the actual question .
T8WBmao8aa	I play the cello (I have for 8 years)    You'll be fine tuning it. It won't break or anything. And if something did happen, then it's a very minor problem and can be fixed easily.     But I'm 99% sure you can go ahead and tune it with no worries.    Have fun with it!    Edit-  To dsjf...  I know many violinists (I know an orchestra full of them, LOL), all of whom tune with their pegs, and never once has one broken a peg. So I wouldn't be to caught up on that.|`|oHSzktF4aa	I suggest that you try it.    I'd know, I've played the trumpet.|`|dcycBGrpaa	Don't tune it yourself, using the pegs are only for major tuning and they break very very easily. Go have your teacher or someone at the store fix it, just to be safe. And they go out of tune all the time, it's no big deal.   I have been playing viola for a long time, and our teacher is the only one who is allowed to tune with our pegs.  I suggest you use the metal ones instead, it is really easy if you have a pitch pipe or a piano.
469ca2d2bcd9b0f6f06c8d756b37b248aa	What a beautiful painting!  You really captured the loving look in this cat's eyes and attitude.    Yes, I agree, $50 is not much for a painting of that size.  I'm guessing that you are not offering the work framed.    One gallery I know advises artists to start out asking relatively inexpensive prices for their work for a couple of reasons.  One is that you can always raise your prices later butyou can't really reduce the prices later because those who bought your early works will feel cheated and may stop patronizing you since you are devalueing their collection.  That might not matter to some people but you still don't want to offend those who it would.      Two is that you want to build a reputation and clientelle, and by making your work affordable you will attract buyers who may repeat buy.  As you grow as an artist, your prices will increase.      Three, you don't want to start so high that you have no sales or lose the commissions you did get.    These times are tough and art isn't selling a lot these days.  Prices for major works have dropped 50% and then dropped 50% again.  I heard that from an art dealer.  But then again, they went up very fast in recent years, so it's more like a bubble that popped.  However, comparing yourself to established artists is comparing apples to oranges.      That you got two commissions in these difficult economic times says a lot about your work and your marketing skills.    All that said, $50 still seems too cheap, especially since they are commissions.  Are the clients friends or relatives?  You didn't say where you are selling your work, whether you're in a big city or a small town.    I'd figure out how much it would cost at $10 an hour and ask for that price.  I bet that would put it at about $75.  If the client balks at that knock off a little.  That way they will recommend you well, and say what a good deal they got.|`|afc818594423abb198b9222afe9865c9aa	I'm a traditional painter myself and i would consider a painting of that quality for pet portraits pretty good, but without knowing it's size and the medium used, figuring a price i feel would be reasonable would be difficult.|`|3iRl21Pqaa	$50 - definitely NOT ENOUGH!  It's beautiful, and I wish you could do my cat.  I would say twice that, but maybe you could think of something between the two guesses.  And just because you're a student, it doesn't mean you shouldn't be paid properly for your work.  Good luck and I hope you can make a living.|`|f49baYxqaa	Don't really know. I've never bought a painting before. I'm guessing maybe $50, but then again i could paint a better one myself.|`|Vv7IvSEjaa	You're very good at what you do. Pricing any art work is just trial and error. If you ask too little people think you're an amateur, too much and no-one takes you serious.    When I sold my first work, I figuered out how much I was paid per 'square inch'. (I was quite happy with the sum.) From there all subsequnt works were measured and a price (using the square inch guide) was made.    This has worked for me for many years although my price 'per square inch' has increased to keep in step with inflation
AA11902108	Well, he pretty much kicked @ss during his first visit in 1924. He refined his unique style which reflected his New Orleans beginnings and his muturing in Chicago. He made his mark in Harlem and became THE trumpet player to hear.     His growing popularity put him in contact with the cultural elites in NY which helped to bring jazz downtown. This influenced mainstream musicians and brought a unique element to popular entertainment all over the country.    "...in 1924 and Armstrong received an invitation to go to New York City to play with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, the top AfricanAmerican band of the day. Armstrong switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section. His influence upon Henderson's tenor sax soloist, Coleman Hawkins, can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period.    Armstrong quickly adapted to the more tightly controlled style of Henderson, playing trumpet and even experimenting with the trombone and the other members quickly took up Armstrongs emotional, expressive pulse. Soon his act included singing and telling tales of New Orleans characters, especially preachers. The Henderson Orchestra was playing in the best venues for white-only patrons, including the famed Roseland Ballroom, featuring the classy arrangements of Don Redman. Duke Ellingtons orchestra would go to Roseland to catch Armstrongs performances and young hornmen around town tried in vain to outplay him, splitting their lips in their attempts.    During this time, Armstrong also made many recordings on the side, arranged by an old friend from New Orleans, pianist Clarence Williams; these included small jazz band sides with the Williams Blue Five (some of the best pairing Armstrong with one of Armstrong's few rivals in fiery technique and ideas, Sidney Bechet) and a series of accompaniments with Blues singers, including Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and Alberta Hunter..."    He went back to Chicago after a year and didn't return to NYC until four years later. Armstrong's mark had been made on music, the city and the renaissance/explosion of black culture in Harlem which paved the way for future integration. The "black experience" for the first time was firmly planted into our NATIONAL experience, psyche and culture.    I'm white as wonderbread but can't IMAGINE a world without Satch- he WAILS!

A true story of freedom and miraculous healing as a Muslim girl finds faith in Christ    When Gulshan Esther, a devout Muslim girl, was six months old, typhoid left her a cripple. Her loving father took her from Pakistan to England to find a cure, but the only hope the British specialist could offer was prayer. Gulshan and her father made pilgrimage to Mecca and begged Allah for healing, but it was not until her father's untimely death that Gulshan began to receive an answer. In her grief she wanted to die, but as she called out to God, for the first time in her life she sensed she was being heard. She heard a low, gentle voice say, "I won't let you die. I will keep you alive--I am Jesus, son of Mary."    As Gulshan began reading the Quran, her interest in Jesus grew, until one amazing night he appeared to her in her bedroom in a blaze of light. He restored her crippled arm and leg and taught her The Lord's Prayer. He told her to go to his people--now her people--and tell them what he had done. Since that time, and to this day, she has been a joyous, obedient disciple of Christ. The Torn Veil is an amazing story of faith and determination.    This moving autobiography was first published in 1984 and has sold over 200,000 copies worldwide.    Author Biography: Gulshan Esther was born in Pakistan. She now lives in Oxford and travels widely speaking about her faith.  Or this one  http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Return-...  At the age of twenty, George Ritchie died in an Army hospital.

dbTPyM7Yaa	Sir K,  There are many great days I have lived that I would love to live over again.     The first one was the day I went to my first Buddhist meeting. I was 17 -by a week- it was amazing! Over 30 people were there, all packed into a fairly small living room. Almost everyone there went to my high school. the meeting was positive, hopeful, realistic, and so much more. Saturday will be my 40th anniversary.    Another day I'd love to relive is the third date I had with my last boyfriend. We had 12 great, vibrant, energetic years together (he is now deceased). The date was in Reno. We played the nickle machine for over 18 hours. We filled it with our nickles, it gave them all back, over and over. But that wasn't the important thing about that date. There is just one golden moment that forged the rest of our relationship. Having taken a break in the nickle collecting to have breakfast, my boyfriend took a moment to visit the men's room. When he returned to where I was waiting for him, he threw open his arms and exclaimed, "there she is!" Then he wrapped me up in his arms and I was his forever.|`|DRNahon0aa	The party, and the night of the party, that me and my friend had.

It is a rather subjective question... for those who are filled with love and peace in God, if you took away their body, you would be removing the abode of God, and the hands that can do so much healing and creativity in the world.

The Stats/Facts:  Alcohol has killed more people,   smoking has killed more people,   prescription drugs have killed far more people.   Not one person in the world has died from smoking pot alone. (go check.)  (In an interview Biden admitted that Corn Syrup is more of a danger to the American people than marijuana and more dangerous to our health.)    No. Of Deaths Per Year By Gun - Over 30,000  No. Of Deaths Per Year By Alcohol - estimated 390,000  No. Of Deaths Per Year By Smoking - Estimated 438,000    No Of Deaths Per Year By Drugs - Estimated 1,800     Bill Maher - funny monologue  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdHg6_pDb...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZSUzy8V_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpBzQI_7e...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjVoK7gnG...    Check the facts of TODAY. You'lll find plenty of studies. Alcohol has proven to be far more dangerous than pot.  It makes damn good sense that Obama believes in decriminalizing marijuana (do you know why? Because it's mental to fight against marijuana when smoking kills and this plant doesn't. Not ONE from just pot use. From all across the globe not a single human being has died from smoking pot. Find the studies online. Use your brain or at the very least listen to the scientists of today not yesterday.)|`|7adb1ec924a232bd76f142d1a8a85b1baa	Take it back.    So much for trying to be a role model for kids.

Also, getting caught smoking once does not make you a pothead. He may smoke regularly, but you have no way of knowing or proving that.

It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books|`|YJcd8OAeaa	the hobbit  lord of the rings  eragon  etc|`|z28JEjWFaa	The Harry Potter series is a great series that fits your criteria.

AA11736322	He who rejects change is the architect of decay.  The only human institution which rejects progress is the cemetery.  ~Harold Wilson|`|FoIxsunVaa	Every action/event has a myriad of consequences good and bad. Every action has good and bad results.

They are a matter of opinion a person and/or a community.  So there is no true goodness    and change isn't always "good" anyways.  For example:  I used to be a peaceful person but then decided to be "bad" and do drugs, hurt people, graffiti, etc.
YWyWTqntaa	It's similar to 'ignorance is bliss'. In many regards, it is probably quite true    Edit: I don't think it is a 'glass half empty' sort of thing. I just think that reality has so little to do with human existence and is so expansive that humans are not capable of dealing with reality in its entirety. It would send us crazy. Our brains couldn't handle it. A degree of ignorance saves our sanity.|`|S88wOtSkaa	yeah it deffinetly makes sence with the world today. you cant let every little thing get to you. sometimes in order to do that its best to just not know some things. theres a lot of uncovered truth out there.|`|TI06IsACaa	I dont think much of it.    "Much of life depends on our being ignorant of reality"     I especially dislike this part. Life depends on our ability to understand reality.....the earth around us. Our technology depends on our ability to understand the science of electricity and all the other things on earth. Being ignorant of these facts would lead us to ancient times. Being ignorant to even more fundamental realities....such as we need to eat to live....would lead to death.    "If we understood reality, we would never go on."    I strive to understand reality as much as i can in my field of work. I live by a code based on reason and rationality.....A is A. Basically, this quote is the very opposite to what I am.    "Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed"|`|ikMOb6gcaa	I think it depends on one's answer to this question: "What is reality?"    Reality:  We consist of basically empty space.  Most of us have heard the statistic comparing an atom to a football field -- the nucleus wold be on the 50-yard line and the outer edge (electron cloud, I guess) would be in the end zone (or something close to that).  Theoretically, we can walk through walls . . .    Reality:  There is SO MUCH we simply don't know.  How much of that would have an effect on what we do know . . . guess what, we don't know that either.    Reality:  The person that said this, and I honestly can't remember who, has no imagination period.  The reality is, the mind can make it's own reality whenever it wants to.  Mental patients notwithstanding, sometimes the best place to be is a fantasy world (lol).    So basically, I'd say that the quote is neither good or bad, merely useless . . . and to me, that's worse than bad.|`|KbnUq585aa	We need to be aware so we can see how to improve what we can and to see just how small at least some of our problems are; things only seem to grow when we keep our backs turned. On the other hand, we need to not perpetually sit and stare helplessly at what we can't budge at all. The A.A. prayer advises us to change what you can and accept what you can't and to always seek to know the difference; it's the healthy balance of these, of understandings, that we need, not a system of games to evade reality. The worst of human history has always included people determined to only know what they want to.|`|6e5c9606952e60fc17250bf668baaa41aa	That quote is definitely from a person who sees the glass as half empty.  The problem I see with pessimistic quotes like this is that they are very dis-empowering.  They encourage a feeling of helplessness.    I think in the long run, ignorance is always much more harmful than reality.  When you live in a fantasy (like the supposed bliss of ignorance), you're just all the more unprepared for when reality deals you a setback.  Those who strive to understand reality are in not only a much better position to deal with it, but also to benefit from it.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	the glass is half empty.  boo fraking hoo.    if we didn't understand reality, i don't think we'd be typing on these computers.

xfTQWoq4aa	I think he said that because after the War, the Allies wanted to make the world a better pplace and punish the people who caused the War so that there won't be another war. They ended up blaming Germany, making Germany pay all the expenses, cut down on there army, and give away the land that they got from winning fights in the war. This was done so that they could stop another war, but they were hypocratic because they didn't make Germany do that to stop the War, they did it because they knew Germany was stringer. The real culprit of the War was Serbia. The Allies blamed Germany to "stop history from repeating itself," yet that is exactly what heppened. Germany got frusterated and started WWII. Does that answer your question?|`|81sucrAEaa	i don't know|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	The Allies were being hypocrites because they condemned the Central Powers for imperialism...Yet, were being imperialists themselves.      That is, the Treaty of Versailles meant the Central Powers were stripped of their colonial posessions; and these went to the Allies.  For example, Germany's Tanzania went to Great Britain, some of Germany's islands in the Pacific went to France.  The imperialistic game wasn't ended, as the Allies promised - It was just that Germany was cut out of the game, with Britain and France expanding their empires.|`|waIPnxwJaa	The world goes in circles.

Most wars are waged for all the wrong reasons. Sometimes they do help people to work towards freedom and they do stop oppression but on the other hand they are waged to make certain people richer. I could give you a lot of examples but I would run out of room. So I think what he meant was it is pretty hypocritical to say we are going to war to protect our country from wmd and then hire all of his best buddies to supply, cook, transport and all the other necessities of running a war so that they all get a piece of the pie while we are out there getting shot and killed for all the wrong reasons. Hope that answers it for you.
M8qLP7MLaa	Well, I wouldn't have to do anything if it were my children, because I would never allow my children to act like spoiled little jerks.    You though... I think the most you can do is hope that the parents of these brats get some back bone and actually learn how to be parents. Let them know how Nicole is acting towards Jade, and let them know that they need to step up and put their foot down.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Cut off nicole's hair so she can get some attention too!    But putting that suggestion behind, I would suggest that when a child is spoiled, it is because the parents do not pay them enough meaningful attention. If you can't fix the parents, you can't fix the problem. Many parents do not think of their children as PEOPLE, but as baggage. Once this is established, the only alternative to infusing the parents with humanity and common sense is to give the kids "tough love" meaning when YOU deal with them, be a drill sargent. Any slight misbehavior gets over the top punishments like scrubbing the bathroom tile with a toothbrush or peeling potatoes for a million years! The parents will object, at which point you say "keep your sticking brats away from me, if you refuse to parent them."     It won't wake them up, but it might save you having to put up with these children's deterioration. I feel so badly for both of these children, and the 30 million just like them all across America.    Parenting ought to require a license, like driving.|`|grKtTRYtaa	Please go on this website:  Mamasource.com    Real moms answer your questions. You can answer.

Good for the family that they have been able to keep it together through such stress.  A second marriage is tough enough.  Would they let you take her to the mall, or something like that?  Or babysit while they take Jade to the Dr.?|`|4VhOi6hvaa	Wow, its a big one! Its often hard to see from the outside and know things aren't right. Then you have to try to find a way to help if you can! I'd say your Aunt and Uncle sound as if they are probably as lost as you are right now. I wouldn't suggest offering advice at this stage as they are probably going through a pretty emotional time. I would suggest if you are really wanting to put effort in and help, that maybe you offer to have Nicole for a few hours each week, just the two of you. You could play it up to be a big treat (not around jade of course) and when Jade has to go for treatment or something is happening where you know Nicole may have to be sidelined, then in you step when possible and spoil her! I know alot of PC parents would gasp at the thought of spoiling a spoilt child, but right now, they just need some stress relief and when this situation with the cancer has become less of a problem and the parents have more time, then they can focus on the girls relationship, which is clearly the key factor in this. Timing can be everything, and right now i think they just need some time to be able to get away, which would also give your aunt and uncle time to wind down and maybe come up with a game plan. When jade gets better, maybe then you can take turns taking one and she won't feel like she was excluded also. Its a tough one, but one step at a time, it won't be a quick fix. I think you taking nicole out once in a while could help immensely. Its also not the girls fault they are a bit spoilt, only children are! And parents of only children usually don't know better!   Good luck, and good on you for caring!  My best to all involved.|`|AVfPXkEraa	I'd tell her I am going to shave her head...that'll make her think twice!

vYgJMybeaa	Communism is an ideology that advocates common ownership of the means of production, ie everyone has equal access to all resources and people work according to their ability. Everyone is equal. There is no hierarchy.     Communism cannot work in one country. It is a worldwide movement. There is no government.|`|5J0sIvksaa	Communists think that everyone should be paid the same. Wheter you're a docter or a janitor, same income. The govt. regulates everything, even the things available to buy.

Research the soviet union, or Russia. They were communist and are rumored to be headed that way again.|`|AA11707728	The only thing that has been common to all communist governments without a single exception is the fact that they have put to death millions on innocent people.    That is the point of communism.  Its reason to exist.  The people who engage in it believe NOTHING in any of its precepts.  Those are all lies in order to keep the populace from grabbing them immediately and executing them for their sinister plans.    There is not a single communist government that ever existed that came through with a single on of their promises.  Nor is there a population that didn't regret resisting them with everything they had while they still had the power to do so.    And understand something else.  In every situation, it all began with the intelligensia.  The educators.  People exactly like those in your history class.

An hour or more after they read it they still remember it, and want more.       Good luck with your writing Jasper's owner.|`|lrZSzvxuaa	You never really do know. Some people may have talent *meyer* that other people don't like. It all depends on the person that reads. It is all on the readers. Take yourself for example you don't like Meyer but that doesn't mean that she can't write. If someone doesn't like the person's writing doesn't mean  that they do not have talent. It all depends on the person. If you write a story and some says that it's awesome then coolio but if they say that you can't write even if your life depended on it then. Oh well you can't win them all.|`|f4Nn0W1xaa	Well, according to KK, I'm definitely not. Of course, by KK's definition nether is Kate DiCamillo, a little detail that might startle all the committees which have awarded prestigious honors to several of her works. I used to read for DiCamillo, and she was in several critique groups prior to ever being published. I know for a fact that she asks and she isn't a copy writer either.    As far as how one knows for one's self, I really don't know what to tell you. I spent today working on something and right now I have a headache and I want to cry. I also want to delete it but someone I asked about another piece the other day told me to stop doing that, so I won't. I won't stop asking though, because other people are going to be more objective than I am and that will allow them to see both what is good and what is bad in my work.     It may also help to prevent me from being so thin skinned as to whine about a few thumbs down. I'm guessing that KK's friends are too scared to offer anything but accolades lest she go all postal on their loser as*.    Don't confuse popularity with talent. Don't even confuse publication with talent. Write if you want to write. Find other people who write. Read. Read about writing. Fail miserably and regularly. Why not? You have nothing to lose. Not trying is the worst thing you can do, trust me.|`|YorMkZYAaa	In my opinion if you have to ask, you're definitely not. Meyer got lucky thanks to her drooling fanbase who wouldn't know good writing if it bit them on the as*.     If you have received high marks from people such as professors, respected writers in your community, business leaders, or other professionals chances are high you're a good writer. I tend to take the opinions of working professionals as a sign I have done something right.    My work has received high marks from experienced writers (technical and fellow copywriters), journalists, business leaders, working professionals, professors, and other members in academia. I'm not writing or working near as much as I used to but I try to keep myself strong regardless. However, I can tell I am lacking these days unfortunately.    I need some refresher courses, I really do. I can admit that these days I am not too good with writing.     EDIT:    For crap's sake people. The thumbs down needs to stop. If you have an issue with me then please take it to messages instead of hiding like a coward.    EDIT 2:    Sugar-Quill Drops (awesome name by the way): THANK YOU!    EDIT 3:    Reader, that was completely uncalled for. You're 45. Act like it instead of attacking me or calling my friends "losers".|`|fIeczCoDaa	honestly, in my opinion, i dont think it should matter if what you write is good or not. when you write something wether it be a song, poetry, or a story, it tends to be a way to let out your feelings and express them. it should be for you, and no one else.|`|wKSvnna2aa	I don't think you can know... you just have to try. Even Harry Potter was said to have been rejected by publishing companies. Actually, many well-known writers did get the rejection slip.     When I read Anne Frank's diary, I remember (among other things) this one quote: "I know I can write... it remains to be seen whether I really have talent..."    Well, obviously she could write. But most people are not blessed with the Soul of a Writer like Anne was, for such a young age.    Writing is like acting, singing, dancing, painting, etc. You either have it or you don't.|`|za9b8cHKaa	A tricky question. Success doesn't not equal talent, and talent does not equal success. If you love writing, you will be willing to refine your skills and will see feedback as an opportunity to improve your writing.     However, the best way to judge how good a writer you are is to judge how other people react to what you have written? Do they respond enthusiastically to the plot or characters? Do they smile at various words, phrases without being sarcastic? Do they ignore the one or two grammatical errors in the work? If so, then chances are, you are a good writer. People are interested in your work and are willing to overlook a few minor faults.    Or do people have trouble understanding or relating to your characters? Do they complain about the plot? Do they make A LOT of comments about spelling or grammar? Do they ask what certain words mean? If so, you are not a good writer. People are not interested in your work.    This is just a guide, based on my own experiences. Other users may have different ideas.|`|1hInIys2aa	Well, I like to give sample chapters of what I've written to others, and see what they think of them.  It's also good to get your work rated on sites like Fictionpress.com, because a lot of those people generally know what they're talking about.  And of course, the more you write, the better you'll get.|`|Th3bifTWaa	Precisely what everyone else said.   But it shouldn't matter if you're good or not; write because you love too.    Ps.  Anyone who's giving KK thumbs down should really stop .   Her answers are straightforward and precise [whether she's had wine or not] . Lay off of her, jeeze.|`|2uFcGttqaa	This is a tough question. I think a lot of it comes from what established writers say about your work. If they say you have talent, you probably do. A professional writer wouldn't say something like that without meaning it. I know from experience. A word of caution however; don't ask your parents/friends to read your work because they won't give an honest opinion. It would be better to show it to a Creative Writing instructor on an English teacher. They see hundreds of pieces of writing everyday, not all of them good. They can detect talent pretty easily.  I'd say the most important thing, though, is to believe in your own ability, because if you don't you won't get anywhere.     I think the writers who couldn't write worth beans just had a good story and people picked up on it. Look at Stephanie Meyer. Just reading the first few pages of her novel convinced me that she couldn't write worth crap. Yet she's practically worshipped by millions of stupid teenagers.|`|bmmlJ7a1aa	ugh  if u love to write, ur most likely a good writer...  i mean... post stuff get feedback... i have to work constantly on my writing
9RTuRPviaa	Catcher in the Rye is full of irony. Some examples are:  -Holden hates phony people but lies all the time.  -He says that he hates the movies and calls D.B. a prostitute for writing screenplays but he keeps bringing up movies that he has seen throughout the book.  -Holden says that he wants to go and live in the woods, away from everyone else. But he constantly thinks of people and wants to be around people (even staying around people he doesn't like)  -Holden calls himself an atheist but talks about praying and has the conversation with the boy at school (the Whooton school, i believe) about how Jesus wouldn't have sent Judas to hell.  -He makes fun of Ackley for being a virgin but finally admits that he is too.  -He calls the people staying at the hotel perverts, but to know what they are doing, he is being a voyeur.    Some Symbolism:  -the red hunting hat shows that Holden is an individual, a hat like that makes the person wearing it stand out at a prep school and on the upper east side!  -the museum is a symbol for stability (you would be different every time you went but the museum would be the same, the displays didn't change)  -the carousel symbolizes youth and innocence  -the broken record symbolizes Holden "falling apart"|`|NZiswBq8aa	Well, I think it's a classic because yes you can read it at any age and look we're still reading it today.

"Hi, Edward." Speaking his name made my lips tingle. He sat down at my table in Starbuck's, though I wondered why he would invite me to a coffee place since he didn't eat. Classic Edward, I guess, always so selfless.    "So..." I said, at a complete loss for what to say. "How's the whole werewolf war going?"    He grinned widely, his eyeteeth glinting in the dim, yellow light from the ceiling lamps. "Jacob's still mad--well, "mad" is a bit of an understatement--about me stealing his girlfriend." His smile grew even more pronounced.    I smiled slightly, though I hated hurting Jacob so. The expression faded quickly to be replaced with a look of sadness. Edward seemed to sense my mood and quickly changed the subject.    "How are you coming along with your essay? Didn't you say it was about a debate of Shakespeare's misogynistic treatment of the female persona?" he asked casually, distracting me so skillfully.    "How did you know that?" I asked rather sharply, though inside I was flattered, a slight pink rising in my cheeks.    He looked sheepish. "Well, I was sort of following you around when I got home from hunting early...That Mike was really giving you a run for your money, eh? It's a good thing you said no though, otherwise you'd be stuck in another movie with a puking Newton," he flashed a smile.    "So, you heard about that?" I said.    "Of course. Jacob's mind is like a beacon, it's so loud," he defended himself. "I can't help but hear it," he said slyly.    "Sure," I said, smirking, playing along. Then my drink order came and the waitress proceeded in trying to woo my new guest. It didn't work, and she eventually stalked away in disappointment. I smirked again as I watched her retreating figure, then quickly returned my gaze to the straight planes of Edward's angel-face...|`|Zfb0s7OWaa	i would be teft speechless. if i ever meet edward cullen.|`|uth8Ztbdaa	I don't imagine myself with fictional characters...I have a real boyfriend.|`|DDTiZRvzaa	Same as the girl above me ^^|`|bmmlJ7a1aa	I would sick jake on edward.|`|ABAcvFVbaa	well i wouldnt say crap becuase he would already know what i would be thinking you know touching him making out with and  since he would be with bella then he would probably get annoyed but yeah that would for surely happen to me if i ever met a edward cullen     i am such a twilight diehard fan lol|`|jLaNVvp3aa	Edward sees me in the parking lot, about to get hit by another car.

I believe that they were not like the other community at all. The people there would take Jonas and Gabriel willingly, not scared about the strangers.

zwq8i70Baa	1. It is Andrew Johnson on top of the bag. It symbolizes the North wanting to come into the south and rule it and essential conquer it.    2. It is a carpetbag, and it references the carpetbaggers that packed their belongings and moved south after the civil war in hopes of prospering in a destroyed southern economy. The words on the front of the bag says carpet bag and bayonet rule. In the bag are soldiers and rifles w/ bayonets attached. The north instituted a military rule in the south for several years after the conclusion of the war.  3. The guys represent union soldiers that were sent to rule the south after the war and avoid another uprising.     As for Grant, his presidency itself was a hands off, let my buddies handle it type presidency. You'll notice in the grant picture that the bayonet rule document is laying on the ground with bayonets scattered around it. In the background you see a black farmer symbolizing a return to slavery. Also the houses and steamboats are repaired in the grant picture as opposed to the first picture on the left.    Hope this helps out!

You can go with a theme or a color or you can be entirely random. You really don't have to purchase any special materials and sometimes the search around your house for the right item or texture or color can be very absorbing. It's easy to find yourself getting lost in both the mental composition and also the actual process of assembling it. In a lot of ways it's the perfect therapeutic art because you really can't do it wrong. You can use everything from magazines to textiles to kitchen items and beads.

D19F6m92aa	Taco is counting casualties, not deaths.    The US had 117,000  Britain had 950,000.  But after that, it is by golly and by guess.  The French never counted their dead.  It was too high, and they would have given up, had they known.  After the war, they counted missing solders and came up with 1.5 to 1.75 million.  Nobody is sure.    The Germans counted their dead, then divided by two and reported that number to the press.  The allies took their own causalities and multiplied by two and used that for the German dead and wounded.  After the war, the Germans claimed to have lost 1.5 million, and allies believed they killed 4.5 million.      I read a new book on ww1, at barns and Noble, that claims the 1.5-1.7 million is accurate, all other numbers were allied propaganda to hide the fact that for most of the war, the Germans were slaughtering French and British solderers 3 to one.      The author also claims the US did not fall into this trap, because we fought like the Germans.  As an example, artillery counter fire.  When an allied canon opened fired, the Germans would figure out where it was shooting from and start dropping shells on top of the allied canon.  The British and the French never learned the trick, but the US did.

AA10729675	Very difficult question.  But very interesting indeed.  1- Uniting belief system lacking?  But it is not that important:  the god we see in the statue is but one representation of God.  It is all one.  Not to worry.  It is all one.  Even if it is just a stone, it is a representation of God, Bhagwaan.  Brahma.    2- What do you mean?  Well, it so happened that Hinduism originated in the Indus Valley River.  There there is a region called Sind (Sindh, Sindhu).  And before Hinduism there was Vedism.  Vedic religion had already a cast system according to Megasthenes in Strabo's work.  But it was not the same system of cast yet.  There were Brahmans and Kshatriyas.  Alexander the Great and his soldiers were considered as Kshatriyas (although bad ones) by the Indians.  But there was also Buddhism there.  Buddhism influenced the Vedic religion a lot, and softened it.  It is then that it became Hinduism.  And mostly to differenciate it from Buddhism, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism.  3- Existence in these hot countries where life depends on the monsoons and the rivers, but also is destroyed by floods, and lions, tigers, boas, etc... can be miserable.  People desired to be liberated once and for all after their death, from the cycle of birth and rebirth.  Greeks too believed in other births after death and called it "metempsychosis".  If life is harsh, one wants to not be borne again in such harsh climate and circumstances.  If you belong to a very poor caste, then you want to be freed from that.  However, any human being can say the same thing as it seems that it is the human condition to suffer.  I hope this can help and is answering the questions, i.e. is right on target.

8i6z125paa	here it is:)  (its the first chapter)      The dream began with the sound of wings. In retrospect I realize I should have known that was a bad sign, what with the Raven Mockers being set loose and all, but in my dream it was just background noise, kinda like a fan whirring or the TV turned on to the QVC.    In my dream I was standing in the middle of a beautiful meadow. It was night, but there was an enormous full moon hovering just above the trees that framed the meadow. It cast a silver blue light strong enough to throw shadows and made everything look like it was underwater, an impression that was strengthened by the gentle breeze blowing the soft grasses against my bare legs in sweeps and whirls like waves lapping sweetly against a shore. That same wind was lifting my thick dark hair from my naked shoulders and it felt like silk floating against my skin.    Bare legs? Naked shoulders?    I looked down and let out a little yip of surprise. I was wearing a seriously short buckskin minidress. The top of it was cut in a wide V, front and back, so that it hung off my shoulders, leaving lots of skin visible. The dress itself was amazing. It was white and decorated with fringe, feathers, and shells and seemed to glow in the moonlight. All over it was beaded with intricate designs that were impossibly beautiful.    My imagination is so darn cool!    The dress tickled a memory, but I ignored it. I didnt want to think too hard I was dreaming! Instead of pondering dj vu moments I danced gracefully through the meadow, wondering if Zac Efron or even Johnny Depp was going to suddenly appear and flirt outrageously with me.    I peeked around as I twirled and swayed with the wind and thought I saw the shadows flicker and move oddly within the massive trees. I stopped and was trying to squint so I could get a closer look at what was going on in the darkness. Knowing me and my weird dreams, Id created bottles of brown pop hanging from the limbs like bizarre fruit, just waiting for me to pick them.    Thats when he appeared.    At the edge of the meadow, just inside the shadows of the trees, a shape materialized. I could see his body because the moonlight caught the smooth, naked lines of his skin.    Naked?    I stopped. Had my imagination lost its mind? I wasnt really up to frolicking around a meadow with a naked guy, even if he was the amazingly mysterious Mr. Johnny Depp.    You hesitate, my love?    At the sound of his voice a shiver passed through my body, and terrible, mocking laughter whispered through the leaves of the trees. Who are you? I was glad that my dream voice didnt betray the fear I was feeling.    His laughter was as deep and beautiful as his voice, and as frightening. It echoed in the limbs of the watching trees until it drifted almost visible in the air around me.    Do you pretend you do not know me?    His voice brushed against my body, making the little hairs on my arms stand up.    Yeah, I know you. I made you up. This is my dream. Youre a mixture of Zac and Johnny. I hesitated, peering at him. I spoke nonchalantly even though my heart was beating like crazy because it was already obvious this guy was not a mixture of those two actors. Well, maybe youre Superman or Prince Charming, I said, reaching for anything but the truth.    I am no figment of your imagination. You know me. Your soul knows me.    I hadnt moved my feet, but my body was slowly being drawn toward him, like his voice was pulling me. I reached him and looked up and up . . .    It was Kalona. Id known him from the first words hed spoken. I just hadnt wanted to admit it to myself. How could I have dreamed him?    Nightmarethis had to be a nightmare and not a dream.    His body was naked, but it wasnt completely substantial. His form wavered and shifted in time with the caressing breeze. Behind him, in the dark green shadows of the trees, I could see the ghostly shapes of his children, the Raven Mockers, as they clung to the limbs with the hands and feet of men and stared at me with mens eyes from the mutated faces of birds.    Do you still claim not to know me?    His eyes were dark a starless sky. They seemed the most substantial thing about him. That and his liquid voice. Even though this is a nightmare, its still mine. I can just wake up! I want to wake up! I want to wake up!    But I didnt. I couldnt. I wasnt in control. Kalona was.

FaX8awk1aa	Beginning in the 8th century, Muslims had occupied and settled most of the Iberian Peninsula. Jews who had lived in these regions since Roman times, considered 'people of the Book', were given special status, and thus thrived under Muslim rule. During persecutions by Iberian Christians, such as the pogroms in Cordoba(1011) and Granada (1066), they were assisted by Muslims. Therefore Jews supported and sometimes even assisted their Muslim rulers never forgetting the harsh treatment they had suffered under the Visigothic rulers of the Iberian Peninsula prior to the arrival of Muslims to Spain[citation needed]. The tolerance of the Muslim rulers attracted Jewish immigration, and Jewish enclaves in Muslim Spanish cities flourished as places of learning and commerce. Progressively, however, living conditions for Jews in Muslim Spain became harsher, especially after the fall of the Omayyad Caliphate to Catholic monarchs.    The Reconquista was the gradual reconquest of Muslim Spain by the Catholic Monarchs and had a powerful religious flavor: Spain was being reclaimed for Christendom. By the 14th century, almost all of Spain and Portugal had been taken back from the Moors.    Overt hostility against Jews became more pronounced (though there was more tolerance at first[citation needed]) and many Jews had actually immigrated from Muslim-controlled lands) , finding expression in brutal episodes of violence and oppression. Thousands of Jews sought to escape these attacks by converting to Catholicism; they were commonly called conversos or New Christians. At first these conversions seemed an effective solution to the cultural conflict: many converso families met with social and commercial success. But eventually their success made these New Christians unpopular with the church and royal hierarchies.    Many of the ruling Spanish, both secular and religious, viewed Jews with deep suspicion. The Jews were also seen as being collaborators with the Muslims[citation needed].    These suspicions on the part of Catholics were only heightened by the fact that some of the coerced conversions were undoubtedly insincere. Some, but not all, conversos had understandably chosen to salvage their social and commercial prestige by the only option open to them - baptism and embrace of Christianity - while privately adhering to their Jewish practice and faith. These secret practitioners are commonly referred to as crypto-Jews or marranos.    The existence of crypto-Jews was an irresistible provocation for secular and church leaders who were already hostile toward Spain's Jewry. The uncertainty over the sincerity of Jewish converts added explosive fuel to the fire of anti-semitism in 15th-century Spain.      [edit] Ferdinand and Isabella  The hostility toward Jews was brought to a climax by "The Catholic Monarchs" - Ferdinand and Isabella, whose marriage in 1469 led ten years later to the unification of the two principal Spanish kingdoms, Aragon and Castile. The result was a single royal state, the precursor of the modern state now known as Spain.    Ferdinand and Isabella took seriously the reports that some crypto-Jews were not only privately practicing their former faith, but were secretly trying to draw other conversos back into the Jewish fold. In 1480, the king and queen created the Spanish Inquisition to investigate these suspicions; under the authority of this new institution, thousands of converted Jews were killed within 12 years. It is not known how many, if any, had lapsed from their new Christianity, or were trying to convince others to do the same.    In 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella completed the reconquista by forcing the surrender of the Muslim kingdom of Granada (Granada had in fact been a vassal state to Spanish royals for more than two centuries). The surrender of the city of Granada placed yet another large Islamic population under their rule, and Ferdinand and Isabella decided to act.      [edit] The Edict  The king and queen issued the Alhambra decree less than three months after the surrender of Granada. In it, Jews were accused of trying "to subvert their holy Catholic faith and trying to draw faithful Christians away from their beliefs."    Some Jews were even only given four months and ordered to leave the kingdom or convert to Christianity. Jews were supposedly granted royal "hostility and sub-mutation" for the effective three-month window before the deadline. They were supposedly permitted to take their belongings with them - except "gold or silver or minted money".    The supposed punishment for any Jew who did not leave or convert by the deadline was death. The punishment for a non-Jew who sheltered or hid Jews was the confiscation of all belongings and hereditary privileges.    As a result of this expulsion, Spanish Jews dispersed throughout the region of North Africa known as the Maghreb. They also fled to south-eastern Europe where they were granted safety in the Ottoman Empire and formed flourishing loca

ceBTTCPwaa	Percy Bysshe Shelley composed the poem Ode to the West Wind in 1819 near Florence, Italy; it was published in 1820. Some have interpreted the poem as an expression of the speaker lamenting his current geolocation inasmuch as he felt helpless to do much about the events happening in England while he was in Italy; at the same time, the poem expresses the hope that its words will inspire and influence those who read or hear it. More than anything else, Shelley wanted his message of reform and revolution spread, and the wind becomes the trope for spreading the word of change through the poet-prophet figure. Some also believe that the poem is due to the loss of his son, William in 1819 (to Mary Shelley), his son Charles (to Harriet Shelley) died in 1826, after "Ode to the West Wind" was written and published. The ensuing pain influenced Shelley. The poem allegorizes the role of the poet as the voice of change and revolution; at the time of composing this poem, Shelley without doubt had the Peterloo Massacre of August 1819 in mind. See too his other poems written at the same time"The Mask of Anarchy," "Prometheus Unbound," and "England in 1819"as taking up these same problems of political change, revolution, and role of the poet.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_to_the_...    http://facstaff.uww.edu/hoganj/416SYL97....    http://creativeteensclub.org/ctc/node/37    http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Special:Se...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	As a political, religious, and literary radical, Shelley was heavily invested in his own ability to influence society. Some poets need solitude and privacy and a retreat in the woods to do their best work, but Shelley needed stimulating arguments and social action. "Ode to the West Wind" is one of the poems in which he considers the role and power of the poet or philosopher to spread new ideas and effect change.    From Shmoop/Ode to the West Wind
vkV2iiBSaa	No.  The statue was designed by a French sculptor named Bartholdi.  Gustav Eiffel ( of Eiffel Tower fame) designed and built the structure and actually constructed the statue.  The model for the statue was Bartholdi's mother.  The name of the piece is Liberty Enlightening the World and it was the winning design in a competition held in France to design a work that would be given as a gift to commemorate America's centennial.  The book has the date of July 4, 1776 on it.  I doubt if the face is really a portrait of anyone.  I'm sure there was a certain amount of idealizing of the features to allegorize her a bit.  Looks a bit masculine, and has more than a hint of Roman caesar about her.

xVL2BNpsaa	I have played this with my colleagues at a creative writing workshop. We were asked to perform a play called Death of Creativity.  So we did a role play: some were teachers, some were students and some were writers. Each group in turn blamed and praise the other groups for the death of creativity.  Teachers's blame: for not going out of the box, for coming in class and just stick to the books and not make lessons interavtive  Students's blame: for not gong beyond the requested homework and instead of trying to do something creative go to the computer to take the ideas from there  Writers' blame: for modifing past successes and not come with anything new.  Try playing with this. And imagine the scene setting with some one as central character.    Hope this helps. Good luck

It is also known as the Shaftesbury Monument, having been erected as a memorial to the philanthropist Lord Shaftesbury. The actual figure rises above a fountain, which is made in bronze, but Eros is made out of aluminium, at that time a rare and novel material. The sculptor was Alfred Gilbert RA, and he used the fountain idea as an excuse for incorporating a variety of fishes and crustaceous life in the design.

ceBTTCPwaa	Heart of Darkness explores the issues surrounding imperialism in complicated ways. As Marlow travels from the Outer Station to the Central Station and finally up the river to the Inner Station, he encounters scenes of torture, cruelty, and near-slavery. At the very least, the incidental scenery of the book offers a harsh picture of colonial enterprise. The impetus behind Marlow's adventures, too, has to do with the hypocrisy inherent in the rhetoric used to justify imperialism. The men who work for the Company describe what they do as trade, and their treatment of native Africans is part of a benevolent project of civilization. Kurtz, on the other hand, is open about the fact that he does not trade but rather takes ivory by force, and he describes his own treatment of the natives with the words suppression and extermination: he does not hide the fact that he rules through violence and intimidation. His perverse honesty leads to his downfall, as his success threatens to expose the evil practices behind European activity in Africa.    However, for Marlow as much as for Kurtz or for the Company, Africans in this book are mostly objects: Marlow refers to his helmsman as a piece of machinery, and Kurtz's African mistress is at best a piece of statuary. It can be argued that Heart of Darkness participates in an oppression of nonwhites that is much more sinister and much harder to remedy than the open abuses of Kurtz or the Company's men. Africans become for Marlow a mere backdrop, a human screen against which he can play out his philosophical and existential struggles. Their existence and their exoticism enable his self-contemplation. This kind of dehumanization is harder to identify than colonial violence or open racism. While Heart of Darkness offers a powerful condemnation of the hypocritical operations of imperialism, it also presents a set of issues surrounding race that is ultimately more troubling.    Madness is closely linked to imperialism in this book. Africa is responsible for mental disintegration as well as for physical illness. Madness has two primary functions. First, it serves as an ironic device to engage the reader's sympathies. Kurtz, Marlow is told from the beginning, is mad. However, as Marlow, and the reader, begin to form a more complete picture of Kurtz, it becomes apparent that his madness is only relative, that in the context of the Company insanity is difficult to define. Thus, both Marlow and the reader begin to sympathize with Kurtz and view the Company with suspicion. Madness also functions to establish the necessity of social fictions. Although social mores and explanatory justifications are shown throughout Heart of Darkness to be utterly false and even leading to evil, they are nevertheless necessary for both group harmony and individual security. Madness, in Heart of Darkness, is the result of being removed from one's social context and allowed to be the sole arbiter of one's own actions. Madness is thus linked not only to absolute power and a kind of moral genius but to man's fundamental fallibility: Kurtz has no authority to whom he answers but himself, and this is more than any one man can bear.    This novella is, above all, an exploration of hypocrisy, ambiguity, and moral confusion. It explodes the idea of the proverbial choice between the lesser of two evils. As the idealistic Marlow is forced to align himself with either the hypocritical and malicious colonial bureaucracy or the openly malevolent, rule-defying Kurtz, it becomes increasingly clear that to try to judge either alternative is an act of folly: how can moral standards or social values be relevant in judging evil? Is there such thing as insanity in a world that has already gone insane|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The environment and mood are serene, though there are constant references to an ominous gloom in the west.

Other notable titles include Notes From the Underground, The Idiot, and The Brothers Karamazov, all from Dostoevsky. Tolstoy's War and Peace and The Death of Ivan Ilyich remain popular, as do a number of short works from him. Anton Chekhov is still widely read and performed.

AA10729675	I have answered this question but it did not register. so here it is again.  The lack of uniting belief is not that important in Hinduism as all Hindus believe that the god they worship is just one representation of the great God.  In fact they are monotheistic.  2- The cultural and societal influences like the casts system made Hinduism vital because it espouses the system with its philosophy.  3- Life was very difficult in the deserts or in the jungles, or during the monsoons, or with tigers and snakes, and mosquitoes.  And they wanted to not return on earth after their death.  So, they wished for liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

There has never been a period of time that produced more geniuses or masterpieces.  Leonardo, Michelangelo, Brunelleschi, Raphael, Dante, Fra Angelico, Giotto, Botticelli, Correggio, Titian, Caravaggio, Bramante, Alberti.  And that's just a tiny fragment of Italy's output.      Three works are perhaps representative of the period however.  Raphael's School of Athens, Michelangelo's, ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter's basilica.  Leonardo's Last Supper and Mona Lisa are both justly famous, but do not merit being the one work to represent the time.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	Michealangelo's "Last Judgment" in the Sistine Chapel, Vatican.|`|e91746f2ef52a840fd7d7a17333e103baa	Probably Leonardo's Last Supper --- or Michelangelo's David.

AA10725882	In the early 1600's under the Tokugawa shoguns, European trade became limited to only the Dutch, and even the Dutch could only occupy an island off Nagasaki.  The shoguns did not like foreign cultural influence in their highly regulated class based society.  The shoguns did not like Christianity either.    Here's an excerpt from Wiki (edited by me)  "Foreign affairs and trade were monopolized by the shogunate.  Portuguese ships were at first European the traders in Japan. The Dutch, English, and Spanish followed.  From 1600 onward, Japan started to participate actively in foreign trade. By 1635 the Japanese "Seclusion laws" allowed European ships only from the Netherlands."    From http://www.japan-101.com/culture/culture...  "Christianity was introduced to Japan in the latter 1500's by Portuguese and Spanish Roman Catholic missionaries - but because it was associated with Western imperialism and considered a threat to Japanese political control, it was banned from the early 1600's to the mid 1800's."    From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution...  "Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu took over Japan in 1600.  He disliked Christian activities in Japan.   The Tokugawa Shogunate demanded the expulsion of all European missionaries and the execution of all converts to Christianity in Japan.  In 1637 a rebellion was led by a Japanese Christian.  The shogunate forces beheaded an estimated 37,000 rebels and sympathizers. The rebel leader's severed head was taken to Nagasaki for public display."

So,you don't even have to believe the many eyewitness accounts of Holocaust survivors - the Germans wrote it all down themselves while they were doing it.
GLS7vgAdaa	You say that you want to be challenged and want to help others so go with me on this idea. I've heard of a dance school in Harlem that is for deaf children. They offer tap classes there since, even though these kids might not be able to hear the music, they can still feel the vibration in the floor and they're wonderful to work with rythmically speaking. Why not do some research and see if you can find a school like that in your area?|`|0cf4Qja5aa	OK!   If what you've said is true, i'll take you at your word and try an answer the question; what does a 18 year old tap dancer who's been around the block do?    Gregory Hines took tap dancing out about as far as it can go in "These Modern Time". So do you try and take off where Gregory Hines left off? I don't think so?     Do you find a "famous" female Dance partner and attempt spring boarding off Dancing with the Stars" as her partner? Maybe!   You'd need to provide an agent with video footage of your work and have them target which young actresses you think may be intrested, have a tap dance background and having them approach her agent and if they are still auditioning for dancing with the stars make up a proposal and approach their agent through SAG etc.ect. You may find one that wants to subject themselves to the rigors of preparing for "Dancing With the Stars".    Produce a Tap Dance How to Video, alot of work and your stuck with the stigma of "those who can do! and those who can't teach".    I've seen a few one person shows here in Canada and in the United States.   google: "Joe Orach" to see some Video footage from his one man show!   http://www.playbill.com/news/article/528...    You may want to write out your own "one man show" and use it to show case your acting, singing and tap dance abilities.    I trained with Phil Black in NYC in the early eighties and loved living in New YorK   safteymax out!|`|ThdFMIFUaa	Not really, but I've never met a male tap dancer before! I live in Alabama, most guys I know are either playing football or hunting. That is so cool!    Keep tapping!  :)
mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  I love this book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.|`|q2u5w69eaa	The Darren Shan Saga? - although boyish it is a really good book for all genders    Da vinchi Code?- I loved it i am not sure if it is teen but i found it very easy to grasp onto and stayed up all night reading it.

In Corel, their is a plug-in called PhotoLab . That plug-in covers all aspect of manipulation whether it's for aging pics, antique-looks, or applying filters. Very using tool for all these effects.    But still, give credit due. ..... yyellowbird's strong point is her sense of creativity. She can convey her message well.    As for getting results with any photo-editing. Yes you can like OBama says. But the one near the pool, that is manipulated slighted. As for the twisted tongue (love the name), Photoshop and Corel can apply similar lighting to that picture.    Good luck....

draNVjbkaa	Networking is vital. It's not who you know, but WHO knows you!    Headshots  In L.A. a good price range is $250-500 (for the session only, this doesn't include touch ups or reproductions). Anything over that is usually by some quack who does no better than a photographer who charges $250.    If you're in LA or NY go to www.reproductions.com and look through their books. Find photographers that photograph people like you well ie. Skin tone, hair color, eye color, ethnicity, age range, physical structure, etc. Choose your top 5 and meet with ALL of them! You want to get their philosophies and their personalities. You certainly don't want to work with someone whose personality sucks for you.    Usually you DON'T get your headshots until you've taken some classes that help you determine the type of roles that you can play. Your best way to determine your type is to ask agents or casting directors. Casting directors especially! They're the ones that are paid to imagine you playing multiple roles based on ONE GENERAL headshot.    With regards to looks, you DON'T want character shots ie. literally dressing like a cop, doctor, etc. NO PROPS EITHER! This is an insult to the casting directors and will get you laughed out of this business. You want 3-4 GENERAL LOOKS! For example, a business suit look can suggest FBI, detective, secretary, business person,etc. A casual look (jeans and t-shirt) can suggest high school, college, blue collar. An upscale j-crew/Banana Republic look can suggest young parent, preppy, white collar, etc.    Also, when you meet with your photographer make it clear that you don't want the following in your headshots:    -Landscape cropping. When a landscape photo is posted online on LA Casting or Actors access, it's appears very tiny compared to a photo that was cropped portrait. CDs get submissions as really tiny thumbnails. They might miss your photo if it's smaller than the majority of photos that are cropped portrait.    -Chopping off the top of the head. When too much of your head is chopped off, it makes it a little difficult as to what your really look like. Cropping off a small part of the top of your head is forgivable, but not to the extent where you look like Hannibal Lecter or Sylar from Heroes' victims.    -Too close. Don't get it cropped too close to where people can't see your body. At least your upper torso should be visible in your shots so CDs/Agents have a fair idea of what you look like physically.    -Silly poses. Headshots are supposed to be as natural as rain. Making stupid poses will just make you look stupider. Such common poses include, but not limited to:  1. Sitting on the toilet. This is where you're sitting down but leaning a little forward.  2. My head is too heavy. Don't do a headshot where your hand is under your chin or even touching your head.  3. Look at me, I have a sexy back! I've seen some headshots where people are in contorted poses, looking over his or her shoulder. It's not natural.  4. I'm a mermaid! This is where you're laying on your stomach with your feet up.  5. Leading with my shoulder    Training  I believe that the first three classes that you should take before even engaging in a scene study/acting class are: Cold Reading, Commercials, and Improv.    Why a cold reading class? How do you get the role? By auditioning! Auditioning and acting are two DIFFERENT worlds! In L.A. especially, the majority of your auditions are cold reads. You're lucky if you can get the sides the night before. Cold reading teaches you how to make sense of the script within a short period of time and also with in a limited space (you don't physicalize as much on auditions as you do when actually do the scene). After you get the part, you can always get an acting coach.    Why commercials? Because those are the money jobs. Build your foundation with commercials so you can afford the best training and materials needed for a successful acting career. Commercials also don't require you to bust out your Meisner or Strasberg techniques. The commercial cds and clients just want to see real people.    Improv is a must period. It teaches you how to not be self conscious, us your imagination, and make bold and quick choices. It also goes great with commercial auditions for a lot of them are improv.    Agents  Agents have access to breakdowns that you alone do NOT have access to. They're the ones that submit you and pitch you to the casting directors who are the ones who say you can go to the audition and are responsible for choosing you to go to the callbacks where the producers/clients ultimately make the decision if you get the job or not.    Agents are also the ones responsible for negotiating your contract and making sure that you get the best deal. They also have to build rapport and good relationships with Casting directors. When looking for an agent, you want to know how strong their relationship with CDs are.    LEGIT agents DON'T take upfront fees. They only make money wh|`|vLF2uz9saa	Won't happen you have to only do acting ONLY. And you are probably going to be stressed in tired because you are going to need way more then acting lessons.

kacLYFrHaa	Ok, let's begin with 1920s in Sudbury Massachusetts. Why then and there? Well, if history is so bunk then why was Ford so interested in preserving it? From 1923 to 1940 Henry Ford tried turning Sudbury, Mass into a themed historical village, purchasing the historic Wayside Inn, and bringing in a schoolhouse believed to be the inspiration for the nursery rhyme "Mary Had a Little Lamb," a boys school, an old grist mill, the Martha-Mary Chapel, and the Redstone Schoolhouse. Ultimately Ford's attempts failed in Sudbury, Mass, but they succeeded in his hometown of Dearborn, Michigan with the creation of Greenfield Village. Greenfield Village includes the home of Noah Webster from Connecticut, the Wright Brother's bicycle shop and house from Dayton, Ohio, and the courthouse Lincoln practiced at in Logan County, Illinois. Now for a man who claimed history was bunk, why did he go to such lengths to move historic landmarks to a village he created for the purpose of showing them off and preserving them for the future?    Then there's his personal autobiography "My Life and Work" which came out in 1922 and details the forty years of his life. Why if the past is nothing but nonsense would he want to detail his own past for folks to read? The obvious reason is because folks wanted know about his life and he wanted to let them know about it.    Beyond Ford himself you have lawyers. Yes, lawyers. In some cases lawyers will actually turn to history, looking at historic court cases or laws which may have set a precedence which could help them with their own case. It becomes important for them to know what has happened in the past so as to not use a case which does not support their own case or get side swiped by such a case.    The same holds true for politicians and ambassadors. For instance, let's say two countries make an agreement that one country has possession of something for a particular length of time say about eighty years time. That is enough time for folks to forget all about the agreement, unless they actually go back over the historic records and pay attention to it. But it's not only historic agreement's politicians and ambassadors must pay attention to. Specific historical dates also become important, especially for ambassadors from one country visiting another. It wouldn't do for an ambassador from the US to be visiting England and congratulate the Queen on her corination forty years ago this year when she was corinated in 1953 and has been reigning over the UK since 1952 (her father died in February of '52 and she succeeded him upon his death).     And what about architecture? Take a look at architectual styles which are listed as either revival (Greek Revival, Egyptian Revival, Colonial Revival) or neo (Neoclassical, Neo-Romanesque (also called Romanesque Revival), Neo-Baroque) because they either mark a return to styles that are from an earlier period in history or they incoporate parts of styles from an earlier time in history in order to emmulate them.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	History is part of the human experience.That entails inventions from a different time being used in a current fashion. Take for instance, the mass production line that had been invented 100 years earlier.   The wheel is older than dirt. He used that to make his car. The automobile first came out in the 1870's.The wheel to steer the auto came from ships, that also has been around a bunch of years.Rubber for the tires is also a part of history. No history no cars.|`|sa1JGWSkaa	Remember the admonition:  "Those who forget their history are destined to repeat it."

I am just going tell you some books and you can judge for yourself it you like them (or if they fit your criteria because only you will know what you will like). Some of the following books are for adults, or written for adults, just to let you know (ex. King, Rice)    First off, I loved 'Salem's Lot by Stephen King. It isn't really "romantic" the lead is male (if I remember correctly) and it is more suspense. I don't remember story book "happy ending" either. That isn't to say it isn't a great book. It is truely interesting.    The think I like about vampire books is that each author has their own spin on what the vampire myth is...    You might also try Ann Rice's books (Interview with a Vampire, etc.) I haven't read them but they are definitely on my list!!!    I have heard good things about Vampire Academy. But I haven't read it (nor do i want to, so take that how you wish)    Amazon is a good site, believe it or not, to search the forums for recommendations on specific book types. I am going to include some direct links to some of the suggestions they have. Also, on the web page at the bottom there are "tags" click on one and it will take you to more suggestions (ex. vampire fiction, vampire romance):    http://www.amazon.com/tag/vampire%20book...    http://www.amazon.com/tag/vampire%20seri...    http://www.amazon.com/tag/vampire%20roma...

GOOD LUCK with your search!|`|5YBXIWzcaa	I'm not sure if this matches your criteria, but the Blue Bloods series by Melissa De La Cruz is really good. The series hasn't ended, so I can't tell you if it has a good series.|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  I love this book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I'm also reading a book right now called Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler. It's about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other, but one day, he dies (somehow which i don't know because i haven't gotten there yet). And also, before, Ivy believed in angels - like an angel for love, etc - but after Tristian's death, she stops beliving in them and thinks she lossed everything.  And because she doesn't believe in angels anymore, she doesn't notice how Tristian's ghost came down as her guardian angel, trying everything to get her to notice him because whoever killed Tristian is after Ivy.  Will he be able to save her in time?  It's suppose to be good

She typed perfect examination papers, spoke fluent French and German, studied Classics and philosophy, and also learnt to ride and swim.  At the age of 23 she published her first book, 'The Story of My Life' (1903), followed by 'The World I Live In (1909) and 'Song of the Stone World' (1910). 'Out of the Dark', a book of essays on socialism, appeared in 1913.    She began lecturing in 1913 to raise money for the American Foundation for the Blind, and becoming a respected lectuer and scholar, devoted her life to working for the blind and deaf.

Also, put a piece of tissue paper over your sketches to keep them from rubbing on adjacent paper.|`|vkV2iiBSaa	Use a product called workable fixative.  It will hold the graphite in place and still allow you to work on the piece later if you wish.  Please don't use hairspray.  It contains chemicals which will damage your paper and the integrity of the drawing.  Eventually it will start to look a little weird, little spots and light areas forming out of nowhere, and there is nothing you can do to fix it.  Stay away from clear spray paint too.  It will seal your drawing from smearing, but it too will damage your work over time.    The fixative costs about the same as hairspray anyway, so use the right product.|`|AAnlhsnGaa	I had a friend in high school who swore by hairspray. Said it worked like a charm.

gIFYYhEWaa	Happy Hiram,  It's not pressure on the strings, it's placing your fingers correctly.  You only need enough pressure to change the pictch.  Try pressing only one string and you'll see what I mean.  Did you take lessons?  I tried the guitar also....but had lots of trouble b/c my hands are small.  However, all kinds of people large and small play the guitar.  I play the ukulele b/c my hands are small and it's so much easier than the guitar.  You might like to play the ukulele b/c it only has four strings....thus less frustration b/c the chords are easier.  And if you're 6'2" tall then your fingers are probably long which makes it that much easier.  Look at some of the people on Youtube tear it up on the ukulele.  Looks like James Hill has fingers 9" long.    A good ukulele for someone with large hands or long fingers would be a the tenor Lanikai LU21T.  http://www.americanmusical.com/ItemSearc...  It's the largest of the ukuleles without going into a baritone.  The baritone is tuned like the first four strings of a guitar and sounds like a guitar without the two bass strings.  The standard "C" tuning of a soprano, concert, or tenor ukulele is G,C,E, A.    Here's a couple chord charts:  http://www.meleukulele.com/PDFs/UkeChart...  http://www.kunisan.jp/ukulele/eindex.htm...  Lessons/songs:  http://www.doctoruke.com/songs.html  Access "BEGINNERS" for starting.  You can also tune your ukulele at the top of the song list.  You can also learn to play the ukulele off Youtube.  Lot's of lessons there.  Look how they place their chord hand with their thumb on the back of the neck.  Looks like their chording hand is a claw.  Lot's of ukulele info at:  http://ukulelehunt.com/  You may even find a ukulele club in your area.  Lot's of fun playing and learning with others.  http://curtsheller.com/ukuleleClubs.shtm...  http://www.fleamarketmusic.com/directory...  Have fun,  CowUkeA|`|qdlmy4l8aa	Yes. How long did you try to play for? It comes with practice as annoying as that sounds, it's not really about strength. I couldn't either at first.    Try nylon strings on the uke too, they're much easier on the fingers, but they do fall out of tune much quicker. (Though it's much easier to tune 4 strings than 6, assuming you'd get a four string.)    I just realized that I said 'much' three times in a row. how annoying. o.O|`|E4jwk6r0aa	it depends on  how indepth your memory is and how wel you hear tonal values, the uke is a form of jazz string insrument and guitar will play a melody but there are middle chords in both and one is harmonious and the other precussionary and harmony, Ukes are neet but it take awhile to find the sound even after learning the chords.    in reference to the five thumb sector , you might try rolling a tennis ball in your hands and working the individual fingers on a presugstive thought per didget, run  'em through a drill and take 'em for a walk, when ou can asign the individual fingers to a task then you have " control" that is any musical instrument to touch typing.|`|577076a28e3180e6d74e269d0d346d57aa	A nylon stringed guitar would be your best bet.

PC12QYoDaa	I think that he did like her in a way, because while he was in company with her he knew that Arwen was going to the undying lands and he saw Eowyn more of a understandable match for him. Since he is human and she is also human. But deep down he still loved Arwen so much that he knew he couldn't give the same love to Eowyn, a love that she deserved. And I think that's why he declined her so to speak. Poor Eowyn :(    Edit: "Frank S" this is Lord of the Rings not the Inheritance Cycle...this is about Eowyn and Arwen....not Arya.|`|TfAkWLigaa	I think he had deep feelings for her and certainly cared, but i think his true love was always for Arywn. He considered his companionship with Eowyn as a strong friendship than a loving relation such as the one he had with his elfish love.|`|QAwKWFKFaa	Well, Aragorn LIKED Eowyn but he did not love her. His heart belonged to Arwen. It was Arwen's sacrifice and determination that bound the doomed love.   I say Aragorn liked Eowyn because he seemed amused when she was helping Gimli get up. He then saw fit to smile at her. Fortunately he told Eowyn about Arwen before, or else I would have murdered him! :) I mean, Arwen was ready to give up her heritage, not go to the undying lands where she would have been immortal, and accept the fact that her love would age and die before her. She would have been, inevitably, left with many years of sorrow.|`|AfdyNi9Raa	In the book Frodo is taken to Rivendell by the Elf Lord Glorfindel not Arwen at all!  The flood happened spontaneously but had help from Gandalf who put the shapes of white horses in to the waves.    Aragon did like Eowyn but if you read the Appendix A of the Return of the King it explains about the relationship of Arwen and Aragorn and the long history they had.|`|LO4Lf7zcaa	i think he only felt for her pain because he knew she loved him but his heart was with Arwyn.  Maybe he even wondered what his life would be like if he had chosen a mortal.|`|8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa	No.  He respected her: her determination, her unwavering support to King Theoden as his niece (sister-daughter)...  Her character as an admirable noble of a noble line. And no more, which was what tore at her.    But he was long committed elsewhere.  A romance so unlikely and impossible that only the strongest of feelings would even have conceived it.  A human, for the daughter of one of the three great elf-lords remaining in Middle Earth?      Elrond was not a very happy daddy.|`|vFF5vwqsaa	ya i think he tatally like lyked herr she is so hott and y wuldnt eragon want to mery hur?|`|btrMdy5Uaa	no, his heart was for Arwyn|`|a0YeSoBEaa	Aragorn liked Eowyn a great deal,if he hadnt fallen in love with Arwen he most certainly would have made his feelings known to Eowyn|`|u8sII9eRaa	Arwyn ! :P !|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	When I first read the book I totally missed the bit about Aragorn being in love with Arwen and couldn't understand why he didn't fall in love with Eowyn!  I think that the changes the film made regarding Aragorn's relationship with Arwen were good.  Anyway, I think he cared for Eowyn but I do not think he loved her in that way, even if he hadn't been in love with Arwen.|`|YcwHV9qVaa	i think i got soft just hearing you ask|`|aYoscopKaa	Nope.

f7jICJo2aa	There are lots of self absorbed people on Youtube already ..
b453xLGiaa	I agree. There must be at least a manifestation of an emotion/feeling during the moment for you to actually distinguish what that "something" is.    As simple as reading a book, if you put yourself in the book, you can experience what's really happening, therefore, you may understand what just happened. It's not just about reading, it's also about comprehension. It doesn't mean it should actually happen to you in reality, just as long as you put your understanding about the situation.|`|daFm97O8aa	I agree entirely.. It's like love, you don't know what it is until you truly feel it.|`|W1JSp0blaa	u r right ... u can understand ,,, but not truly until u experience it|`|tyWacgrGaa	This is very true. Part of fully understanding something is experiencing the emotion and feelings that takes place during it. With that being said, just because you experience something, that doesn't necessarily mean you truly understand it too. You may have to undergo the experience more than once to truly understand it and do so with a unbias mind.|`|vRk86MYnaa	I agree. I get loads of people saying they've seen ghosts in their bedroom. I have never, ever seen a ghost in my entire life.   I kinda have a belief in god, because my friend makes him sound so believable.   I asked her, 'Then how do you get answers from him?'   'He may answer you in your sleep.'   So I made a pray, went to sleep and had a normal dream, no answer. :P  Now I believe that if you wish for something to come true, you have to make it come true.|`|T4CZbRsSaa	don't agree... it sounds good... but then again half the time we don't truly understand the things we're living through...     most find its the results that are important...    everything we think we understand is colored with the self shaded lenses of perception... indeed the only way we can know anything is through self...     patterns... and rhythms... rhymes and timing... everything reminds us of a song...|`|BMQlzUkfaa	I agree.  That is why it was important for us to experience things here on earth.  To give us experience and hopefully to learn that choosing the good makes us happy and choosing the evil will ultimately make us miserable.|`|f0850578f9cb1b6e79940540e6c2eacfaa	There are many different ways to learn a lesson.  Experience, study, visualisation, etc.    Understanding just means you have more knowledge, and therefore require less belief. However, you never have complete knowledge, and so you never truly understand. You may come so close, and have so much knowledge from study, experience etc,  but there is still an element of belief required before you can understand.    The more belief you have, the less you need to experience something to understand it. Also, there are some things you can never experience, and so understanding must come from study and belief.    It is certainly true that experience provides a lot of knowledge.  However, it does not mean that you understand.  It may be that with the extra knowledge, you only become more confused and therefore lose the required amount of belief to enable full understanding.|`|3IVqoH16aa	I think the statement better applies to feelings.  Like you can't really understand what feels like to go through something until you've gone through it yourself.  Watching something on TV while in your comfy chair  eating Doritos is not the same as going through it.|`|ztke9DOPaa	geniuses!|`|DvJJu8Dwaa	I think that is true because we are so judgmental now a days...  People now a days -.-;|`|dRiBGoJkaa	yes it's true, i experienced Christianity now i'm an atheist, i've experienced drugs and alcohol and can tell you what is really bad.  Everything i speak off i speak from experience.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	I think it is true in many ways. But, it is possible to understand, for instance, making change for a dollar, even if you have never done it. Therefore, it follows that not being able to understand another's feelings in any given situation is certainly a viable perspective, but the act itself, depending on the nature and specifics, may very well be understandable. It is not a guarantee, but possible.|`|6542d65c904582403b7e46c7c170a38eaa	I think that given enough information, you could understand something you've never experienced.  I have never experienced losing a child but I understand what that experience must be like.|`|AA11635601	Nope, disagree.  It may be, particularly if you're young, that you can't imagine how an event might make a person FEEL, emotionally, but certainly we can all watch a person burn to death and understand what is going on, or watch someone win an important contest and see the radiant triumph in their face and actions.  I myself have witnessed a number of events that have not happened to me, but it's quite apparent what it is that is happening, and often, quite apparent how that is making that person feel and within the reach of imagination how that would make anyone feel.    So maybe some people can't imagine how some things would make someone feel, but beyond that, I disagree that until you experience something you can't truly understand it.|`|OTxCCXa5aa	I'd say you're right. But you can still be understanding of it, you can still see how it makes a person feel and how it affects someone so you can be aware of it, if that makes sense!|`|OqlXBUsaaa	ancient philosopher Lucretius once wrote,    "what can there be more certain than our senses" he ask,"to mark the true things and false?" the explains that the mind, not the senses is responsible for illusions."don't blame flaws of judgment on your eyes"|`|7aK81hsbaa	i agree, knowing about something is not the same as experiencing it.  much, much more knowledge is learned from living an experience than just hearing about it.

I am going to have to read it over again sometime soon to fully absorb all of the symbolism and stuff.    I am going to start reading Girl Interupted tonight, by susanna kaysen (spelled right?). I haven't started reading it just yet, so i can't tell you how it is.... but here is the wikipedia page and a short summary:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl,_Inter...    When reality got "too dense" for 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen, she was hospitalized. It was 1967, and reality was too dense for many people. But few who are labeled mad and locked up for refusing to stick to an agreed-upon reality possess Kaysen's lucidity in sorting out a maelstrom of contrary perceptions. Her observations about hospital life are deftly rendered; often darkly funny. Her clarity about the complex province of brain and mind, of neuro-chemical activity and something more, make this book of brief essays an exquisite challenge to conventional thinking about what is normal and what is deviant.

I've started on Dies the Fire by S.M Stirling, its not my usual genre and sometimes the writing is really not my style and a bit stereotypical and i don't like how he always adds the character's exact thoughts, Like "We'll take care of you until then." he said, but he didn't add, you'll probably never see your parents again.

I'm not normally a non-fiction person, but I really enjoyed reading about the people behind fundamentalist/extremist groups.

I am currently reading The Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett again. When I found out he was not writing anymore, I felt I needed to rehash a few old favourites. This is the first Pratchett I ever read. It is, without a doubt, storytelling genius.     Next, I plan to read Non Fiction by Chuck Palahniuk.

uy4wtWGJaa	That really depends if you are looking for someone more recent or if you are looking for someone in America or even if you are looking for someone may have negatively changed history.  You can look at someone like Hitler and make a strong argument that he changed history more than anyone just because the actions he started were so drastic effected so many people.

Gem96NQyaa	Consider yourself lucky... most authors have pretty good turnaround these days when it comes to series because they know if they wait too long, they lose readers.

This is a seven book series. Is a romance).   Twilight, by Stephanie Meyer ( Romance, as I'm sure you've heard).   Salems Lot, by Stephen King ( it's a Romance of sorts. A little creepy. Not for young readers, again!)    Harry Potter, by J.K Rowling ( Not a romance, but a good story).

jR8kyp0Taa	Starry Night by Van Gogh is my favorite painting. I can just sit and look for minutes at a time, using my imagination, thinking about what the painting is supposed to mean, and what it means to me, etc.  It is interesting where the sky looks like they turn into waves crashing into the village, and then there is the ominous black thing on the left that is supposed to be a juniper tree. And then what is that thing in the middle? Twilight Zone?     Boy Wonder|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Starry Night by van Gogh because I can see the torment that he was experiencing, the swirls in the sky.    The Milkmaid by Jan Vermeer. I just like the subject matter and his style of painting.  It is simple and everyday. I always wonder what she is thinking while she does her chores.      I have lots of other favorites so it's hard to choose just one.|`|hXaq6JZ2aa	"Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette" by Van Gogh.

Then he can go through the guilt of it wondering if he will get caught. On TV and the movies, the murderer is very one sided. Many people who kill live with a tremendous amount of guilt and anxiety. On TV, you see these heartless characters that kill someone and don't have any regrets. Those people are in the minority. The character could become so entangled in guilt that he might consider suicide himself, or confessing to the authorities. Some murders in real life have confessed to murders but the authorities dismissed their pleas because there is no tangible evidence to support the confession and they are sent away for mental health counseling. Not like TV in the real world at all.|`|Jime0cdqaa	Who is your character and what is he like?|`|2ersp6Lfaa	..Bomb tester. :D|`|HWyhc5rdaa	Ask and answer questions in Y/A.

6kIw66Soaa	WELL MY FRIEND,....  i like the way you are willing to accept any critic to your hard work,.. but let me tell you, when you start a story you have to transport the reader to the very moment ithe plot or the begining is happening,.. when i read your stuff made me wonder more about the enviroment is about,.. and i have to say that i didnt feel it at all, its not about to tell exacly everything is around but to tell about "the areas from the enviroment that talk about it by themselves" remember that the real work of a writer is to make the reader feel what you want them to feel in the moment they read it,.. then to control their feelings in the way they just cant stop reading and reading, keep up the good work.|`|DEYvhPtpaa	Its pretty good, but the beginning has too much "purple prose." You are over describing and making everything into a string of adjectives which reads rather harshly and choppily. Work on that and it will be really good.|`|BxaajBbOaa	This much better than most of the stuff I read on here. Definitely not twilight inspired, I agree. The first comment is right. While your writing is good, it almost seems as if you're trying to hard to stuff it with as many descriptive words as possible. It seems stiff and formal. Try loosening up your prose a bit. You may even try a writers class where you can get better feedback on your work. Good luck.|`|PCug0kU0aa	you're a good writer.  Hey, you answered my question a few days back, about whether or not you would join a group if my friend started it. His name is Curtis, and he's started it, called it Writers United.

o36YrSWRaa	Well, generally speaking, when you want to get into an orchestra you have to audition and play excerpts from orchestral repertoire for your instrument.   Even though there are lots of violinists in an orchestra, every player is usually accomplished and always well-trained.   If you're talking about an amateur group the requirements will obviously be much lower.|`|fnCIoS1vaa	Depends on what kind of orchestra you intend on playing in.  Are you planning on auditioning for a beginner's orchestra?  Or an advanced one?  Which section do you wish to be in? (Firsts, seconds etc ...)    You are usually asked to play passages from the pieces that the orchestra is playing.    An important skill you need is to be able to sight-read music well.  What this means is that you can perform a piece of music that you have never practiced, played nor seen before. Try singing what you think the tune of the song is before playing it, so you have an idea of what the song sounds like.    If sight-reading is one of your weaknesses, you can work on it by taking a look at new pieces that you've never played before, and attempting to play them. Try singing what you think the tune of the song is before playing it, so you have an idea of what the song sounds like.    Also:  Before playing a new song, take a careful look at the time and key signature. Pay attention to the speed that's required for the piece. Is it 'Allegro', 'Lento' etc ..    Best of luck, and I hope I helped ..  =]

You will find your own path .|`|6sAbs2iiaa	Hi, I think you are still very young and have soo much to see in life .Moms usually pushes cause they love you and want what's best for you. I personally will give you my opinion I think you should finish your year left cause if you don't believe me you will regret it later on the earlier you finish school the better trust me as for relationships I don't think your a loser cause you've never had one I think your still very young and have your whole life infront of you and I'm sure one day you will find someone that you will find very intersting but for now life goes on just finish your studies and don't pay attention to people that tells you that your a loser and stuff they are just jealous on top I agree with you today's world is all about sex I find it very stupid cause there is so much more out there to see and know then sex. WhenI was your age I was pretty lost also I drop out of school Biggest mistake and was lost  I started reading the bible cause I had soo many qustions like where do we go  when we die or Who create us or Why are we here what's the purpose and today I know all the answers and my soul is much happier I'm married for 10 years and have 3 beautiful kids. I fully recommend that you find a good church NOT jehovah's  and make christian friends you will see life will be much better and you will be blessed .|`|b4XeU5AVaa	Relationships are important. You have proved yourself wrong.  A friend is someone you could tell this to, and who would understand you. That is a relationship that brings meaning and joy to life.    When it's with a girl, and she's attractive, you can call it love.|`|OmaLS6Efaa	ill tell you one thing:  somone once told me that he would never tell his girlfreind he loved her even thought she would always ask him to say it..she asked why and he answered that he didint love her but rather himself.the only reason your with this person is beacuse it makes you feel happier and better about yourself wich therefore means that you love yourself more than her...you sound a littl depressed and a girl can help but if you achieve hapiness and your goals without one then therres no ppoint in a girlfriend|`|DlyRpuZJaa	Personally I know how you feel.  I have been through the same things.  My suggestion is to find something in life that you do truly enjoy.  I have found that relationships are not needed in life. But I also suggest trying at least once.  If you don't care for sex that is ok too, again I can relate.  I don't do it, and I get along fine.       The main h=thing is to find in life what you do enjoy.  Realize that you are here to help and serve other people.  But find the balance so that you are happy also.  .
D9x1QSgiaa	I just left the website of a girl who is age 18 and has done some INCREDIBLE surreal images using her digital camera and Photo Shop. My jaw fell open when I saw her work.    You gotta take this job by the horns and get CREATIVE. That means making images that other people are only dreaming of. I'm talking about people floating in the air or walking on water without making a ripple, an old woman wrestling with a 10 foot long grasshopper, a kid getting a ride on the back of a cricket or a man with a rhino horn growing out of his head. Are we connecting here??? The more BIZARRE the better. We need to see things getting "Photo-Shopped" in ways you never dreamed of.     The world of photo-journalism also offer "possibilities". being the first guy on scene of a house fire, traffic accident or something similiar. You images have to tell a story.     Good Luck|`|k8AcVixTaa	It takes work to become famous.  You need to find your niche and become the best.  That is where the work comes in.

Good stuff, you gotta be really good though.)  Take classes and get better, even if you're amazing.  Show them to your friends and your parents and your parents friends, take your camera to dances or school related things, show them to your teachers, and everyone you know.

The meaning of parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme    The herbs parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, recurring in the second line of each stanza, make up for a key motive in the song. Although meaningless to most people today, these herbs spoke to the imagination of medieval people as much as red roses do to us today. Without any connotation neccesary, they symbolize virtues the singer wishes his true love and himself to have, in order to make it possible for her to come back again.  Parsley (Petroselinum crispum)    Parsley is still prescribed by phytotherapists today to people who suffer from bad digestion. Eating a leaf of parsley with a meal makes the digestion of heavy vegetables such as spinach a lot easier. It was said to take away the bitterness, and medieval doctors took this in a spiritual sense as well.     Sage (Salvia officinalis)    Sage has been known to symbolize strength for thousands of years.  Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis)    Rosemary represents faithfulness, love and remembrance. Ancient Greek lovers used to give rosemary to their ladies, and the custom of a bride wearing twigs of rosemary in her hair is still practised in England and several other European countries today. The herb also stands for sensibility and prudence. Ancient Roman doctors recommended putting a small bag of rosemary leaves under the pillow of someone who had to perform a difficult mental task, such as an exam. Rosemary is associated with feminine love, because it's very strong and tough, although it grows slowly.     Thyme (Thymus vulgaris)    According to legend, the king of fairies dances in the wild thyme with all of the fairies on midsummernight; that's the best known legendary appearance of the herb. But the reason Thyme is mentioned here is that it symbolizes courage. At the time this song was written, knights used to wear images of thyme in their shields when they went to combat, which their ladies embroidered in them as a symbol of their courage.    This makes it clear what the disappointed lover means to say by mentioning these herbs. He wishes his true love mildness to soothe the bitterness which is between them, strength to stand firm in the time of their being apart from each other, faithfulness to stay with him during this period of loneliness and paradoxically courage to fulfill her impossible tasks and to come back to him by the time she can.      That "Island" guy can be a real jerk about answering questions. I think he might be a guy also known as "retired roadie", cuz they both answer questions like you are an idiot for not knowing the answer.  .  I think it was a pretty good question, cuz I didn't really know why the herbs were in the song either, except that you might go to Scarborough fair to buy them.

The islands of the Caribbean are called the SPICE ISLANDS, you know!|`|e9v0jjHJaa	I think they're herbs that were once used in the preservation of a body. (Seriously.)

ZDrXFS2daa	James Madison  Madison was a delegate to the Virginia Convention (1776) and served in the Virginia House of Delegates three times(1776-77; 1784-86; 1799-1800). Before becoming a member of the Continental Congress (1780-83), he on the Council of State in Virginia (1778-79). He called for the Constitutional Convention in 1786. He served as a US Representative from 1789-97. He drafted the Virginia Resolutions in 1798 in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts. He was Secretary of State from 1801-09.    Thomas Pinckney   After the war, Pinckney spent some years running his plantations before he returned to politics. Pinckney was Governor of South Carolina from 1787 to 1789, most notably presiding over the state convention that ratified the new U.S. Constitution, and then served in the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1791. He was appointed by President George Washington to be the U.S. minister (ambassador) to Great Britain in 1792. While there, he was unable to get British concessions on issues such as impressment or the Northwest frontier forts, so that Washington sent John Jay as a special envoy to negotiate the controversial Jay Treaty. For part of his tenure (1794-1795) as ambassador in Britain, Pinckney also served as Envoy Extraordinary to Spain. He arranged the Treaty of San Lorenzo, also known as Pinckney's Treaty, with Spain in 1795.    Pinckney's diplomatic success with Spain made him popular at home, and on his return the Federalist party made him a candidate in the 1796 presidential election (as the intended running-mate of John Adams). While Adams won the presidential election, complicated scheming to ensure that Adams would have more presidential votes than Pinckney ended up making their opponent Thomas Jefferson vice-president.    Pinckney was elected to the United States House of Representatives from South Carolina to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William L. Smith, and he served from November 1797 to March 1801. While in Congress, Pinckney served as one of the managers appointed by the House in 1798 to conduct the impeachment proceedings against William Blount.

Just concentrate on your own needs and disregard any problems which other people encounter.  For me, a tough life doesn't involve those things which you have mentioned.  A tough life involves having a larger view of mankind, acknowledging  that there are problems in the world and that some of us, who are privileged to live in a fairly sheltered environment should actually take an active part in the promoting the well-being of all our fellow men.  You did post this question under philosophy.|`|4XlWLeSsaa	the gates of hell are wide and open......check your phone messages...and come up with yet another excuse to not pay today.....that should be simple enough....P.H|`|BMQlzUkfaa	Life is simple if you have the right goal in mind.    Jesus taught that.      In Matthew 11:28 it says:  Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.     29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.     30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.     When life is over and you die, money won't matter, prestige and fame won't matter.  What will matter is what you have become.    I believe that if we set Jesus as our example and pattern our life after the things he taught that in the end we will be successful.  Eternally successful.  I also believe that we will exist after this life, and that what we do here will determine our eternal progression.  Jesus Christ has shown us the way to be truly happy.  Now it is up to us to either accept or reject that example.    Often times our choices or the choices of others make life tough too.  I heard a great quote once that was attatched to the bottom of a picture of Jesus Christ.  It said:  "I never said it would be easy, I only said it would be worth it."  I think this statement is very true.  Sometimes through our trials we become better and stronger.      I am not saying that you should not have a job, or do the other things in life that are necessary and important, only that your main focus and goal in life should be to be as much like Jesus Christ in your attributes as possible, and then you will be happy.|`|UBRs2uxRaa	Chinese Proverb:        * With money you can buy a house, but not a home.        * With money you can buy a clock, but not time.        * With money you can buy a bed, but not sleep.        * With money you can buy a book, but not knowledge.        * With money you can buy a doctor, but not good health.        * With money you can buy a position, but not respect.        * With money you can buy blood, but not life.        * With money you can buy sex, but not love.|`|AA11219693	I think a desire for ease is the right antithesis of toughness, as sometimes-unavoidable complexities are that of our sense of simplicity. We avoid complications and sensibly seek to know as to what level of sophistication we could easily and most efficiently be operational, as who could our life be neither too simplistic to be of any use, and nor too tedious to be enjoyable. The knowledge and the understanding of the middle golden path of life  come with experience, in form of sensibility; we use sense to find better reasons for us in life.       There are a number of reasons, both natural and unnatural, that can drive us powerfully, making us work harder than we need, for instance. First of all we have and inbuilt capacity, not ability, for extravagance and exuberance, that is naturally purposed within our mind to accommodate our passion for things we need to achieve, our longing to be our ideal self, to excel, to endlessly strive for all things new and wonder or new and wonderful meanings in all things we might already have. This is to make life ever so better, richer and more beautiful.     Then we have our instinctive urges to compete with others, to win battles to bring home the best bounty, the best hunt and reward for the days word. We by our very human nature are also programmes to be able to diverge from the normal course of nature to exceed natural bounds and limits, to go where we have never gone before. Our ambitions, dreams, aspirations, hopes and expectations all are natural part of our mind. Now mind can be without wishes and desires of its own, all these faculties of our own mind as hard taskmasters. They are in fact for our own good, but they could also make us work too hard to be comfortable, content and happy.    I therefore think instead of seek ease in living we should seek comfort and happiness in all that we do, or aim to achieve. There is no point dying of a heart attack so that in ten years time we do have a heavy mortgage, or a risk of running out a source of income. I think our ability to sense comfort and happiness set us our natural measures in everything. If we put all our needs at one place, i.e. our ambitions and desire to succeed as well our need to be comfortable and happy in life, we could become more sensible I life, to see what reason we need to follow and what we better leave aside.
p5wkOii3aa	I have been using papier mache in my work lately, and I have a really good recipe which is cheap and easy to make:    6 cups water  1 cup flour  2 tsp. salt     -Boil 4 cups of water in a pot.   -While the water is coming to a boil, mix together the flour, salt and the remaining water, ensuring that there are no lumps.  -Pour flour and water mixture into boiling water.   -Stir constantly for two minutes.  -Remove from heat, cool completely.

Have you ever asked anyone in your family about the old country? Do you still have grandparents or great aunts/uncles you could interview? They most likely have a wealth of information on old family traditions or can give you old family recipes. It's amazing what you can learn about your ancestors and essentially about yourself if you just take the time and ask a few questions. Enjoy it, and if you are able to give a few family interviews, tape record them!! You'll thank yourself in years to come!|`|ZDrXFS2daa	Pick one. If you are mostly English, choose that and do research on some strictly English traditions.     Irish is pretty easy to find also. I taught a class on Irish history to a class of Head Start children and I did the whole day's lesson based on Irish history. I did it on St. Patrick's Day. We ate Irish Stew, colored Irish flags, packed our suitcase to go on the long trip to Ireland, found "gold" in the grass, made leprechauns out of tin cans and ate green snakes (rolled out green dough bread sticks). Of course that was for 3, 4 and 5 year olds, but you get the idea.     Pick one nationality and do research on it.
ceBTTCPwaa	Venus de Milo on display at the LouvreAphrodite (Greek: ??; Latin: Venus) (pronounced /??fr??da?ti/; Ancient Greek: IPA: [ap??o?di?t??], Modern Greek: [af?o?eiti]) is the classical Greek goddess of love and beauty. According to Greek oral poet Hesiod, she was born when Uranus was castrated by his son Cronus. Cronus threw his severed genitals into the sea, and from the aphros (sea foam) arose Aphrodite.    Because of her beauty, other gods feared that jealousy would interrupt the peace between them and lead to war, and so Zeus married her to Hephaestus who was not viewed as a threat. However, Aphrodite became instrumental in the Eros and Psyche legend, and later was both Adonis' lover and a surrogate mother.    Aphrodite is also known as Kypris and Cytherea after the two places, Cyprus and Kythira, which claim her birth. Her Roman equivalent is the goddess Venus. Myrtle, dove, sparrow, and swan are sacred to her.    http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Aphrodite....    http://www.theoi.com/Cult/AphroditeCult....    http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/Aphr...    http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/arts/d...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony|`|DvToP5h7aa	The Odyssey by Homer Written 800 B.C.E    About Aphrodit     Goddess of love. In the land of the Phaikians, the bard Demdokos sings a tale about Aphrodit cheating on her husband (Hephaistos) with the God of war (Ars); she is caught in the act, literally, when her husband catches the lovers in a net and lets everyone have a look-see.     http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...      Klytaimnstra, Aphrodit, and Penlop    These first two women listed are unfaithful wives. We sort of understand Aphrodit's situation because shes the goddess of love. Klytaimnstra, on the other hand, is really bad news, as she not only cheated on her husband Agammnon but killed him when he got back from war. Penlop, however, is a beacon of fidelity. These two adulteresses serve to highlight Penlops incredible virtue, which makes this a clear foil.    http://www.shmoop.com/character-roles/li...    --------------------------------------...

Do you mean Athena?|`|SkG93Ybmaa	The best answer is: "Read the literature!". But I'll give you a hint. Check out sparknotes.com for Iliad character reviews and plot notes. You can also just do a search there for Aphrodite.    Aphrodite - Goddess of love and daughter of Zeus, Aphrodite is married to Hephaestus but maintains a romantic relationship with Ares. She supports Paris and the Trojans throughout the war, though she proves somewhat ineffectual in battle.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	Aphrodite doesn't even appear in the Odyssey, but she has a fairly large role in the Iliad, where she continually intervenes on behalf of the Trojans, who are favorite  people of hers.  Not only did she cause Helen to fall in love with Paris after he awarded Aphrodite the golden apple over Hera and Athena, but she has a son, Aeneas, by a Trojan father.  She actually gets wounded in battle when she rescues Aeneas from Diomedes.  She also rescues Paris from Menelaus when Menelaus is in the process of strangling him with his helmet strap, and then, disguised as an old woman, she goes to find Helen and tells her to go down to her bedchamber and take care of her lover.  Despite being divine, however, Aphrodiite is depicted as not unusually smart.  When Hera, who is on the other side and resents Aphrodite anyway, comes to her and asks sweetlyfor a love charm for a friend of theirs (which she actually wants to enable her to divert Zeus's attention from the fighting so that the Achaeans can regain the upper hand), Aphrodite trustingly gives it to her.    In the Odyssey, far fewer gods appear than do in the Iliad, and Athena performs some of the acts that one might expect Aphrodite to do, such as making Peneloope more beautiful when she needs to be and prolonging Odysseus and Penelope's first night together after twenty years.

5t0DYU6Baa	Okay so here is how much i think the actors suited their characters [first is best, last is worst.]    1.Emmett  2.Alice  3.Edward  4.Jasper  5.Carlisle  6.Rosalie  7.Jacob  8.Esme [I imagined her blonde with short hair for some reason]  9.Bella|`|GFzDwIk6aa	I agree. Robert Pattinson is not attractive. I was under the impression that all American girls found him attractive, and it was just us Brits that could see that he wasn't cute by any means, but obviously not.  But, tbh, I didnt think Taylor Lautner [Jacob] was attractive either.  Jackson Rathbone [Jasper] definitely did look constipated. In fact, while I was watching the movie, one of my friends called out "Do you think he needs laxatives or something?" lol. But, idk, he was kinda cute anyways.  Nikki Reed [Rosalie] was a dissapointment too. She wasn't anywhere near pretty enough.     Actually, I was dissapointed with the whole film in general. It was nowhere near as good as the books.|`|nEhDpDMVaa	I was more disappointed in Rosalie. In the book she is described as the most beautiful thing in the world and I didn't think the movie did her justice.|`|ARLr7k0Faa	Personally i think the whole cast was AMAZING! I kind of pictured Bella differently. But Taylor Lautner (Jacob Black) Rob Pattinson (Edward Cullen)  Did a great job, i also thought Jasper did good he had to look a little weird!|`|SFxQyTfJaa	No....  Edward was really hot I think (not as much as in the book but ok)  and Jacob looked terrible!!! His hair!! No I don't like Jacob at all but the actor with all these extensions....ugh...  But without the extenions he looks also as good as Robert (some times even better ^^) cute cute cute !!|`|wU0c3i7baa	I mean, it's personal preference. I think both Jackson Rathbone (Jasper) and Robert Pattinson (Edward) are sexy.    Rob's look is a little unusual and I think you have to be into the tall and lanky look. He almost does look like a vampire with his gaunt face and asymmetrically pointy nose. His perfectly carved jawbone is about the only classically handsome part of his face. He's not for everyone.    Jasper looked constipated throughout the film because he was supposed to appear physically uncomfortable around humans. He's constantly restraining himself so he doesn't lose control and attack a classmate. He probably breathes very little lest he inhale their scent.     Taylor Lautner (Jacob) is really pretty. Nice skin and smile.    In general, I think many people confuse Edward and Robert Pattinson. When they say he's hot, they're really talking about Edward.|`|79YQAbSRaa	He was better as Cedric Diggory.  And Jasper reminded me of Edward Scissorhands.|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	I am way too old to comment on the "hotness" factor of the cast of Twilight - hell I have a kid nearly the same age as Robert Pattinson........I think there are laws against me noticing.  (With the exception of Pete Facinelli - at least he and I were born in the same decade!)    I think that all the actors represented their characters well.  All in all though I would have to say Alice Cullen was the best cast.  She comes across on screen just as you expect her to from the book.    I think there was something to be desired in the acting from the movie - but I think that was partially the directors take on the characters, and I truly expect we will see an improvement in the next movie.|`|3PbKeg2uaa	Not,his jaw line is strange but eyes are cool
KH3kbRjgaa	In this first two lines of the poem introduce us to the main topic of the duke's speech, a painting of his late wife: "That's my last Duchess painted on the wall, Looking as if she were alive."

But as we read this lines, we arrive to the conclusion that for the Duke, his late wife was nothing more than her external appearance. And once again, the Duke, shows off his control as he did in the beginning parts of the poem. He adds a parenthesis in his speech, "since none puts by, The curtain I have drawn for you, but I". Here he says that nobody but him has the power to display the painting. But this is obvious and did not need to be said. Since the painting is in his home and he owns it, of course he is the one who would draw the curtain to display it. He only adds this statement to highlight his control. As the poem progresses, we find more mention of the duke's love of control and realize that it is a very important thing to him. This line also is important because it shows that the duchess was and still is, under complete control of the duke and can only be seen by others when he wishes it.    But the truth is that the painting of the Duchess will live on long after her death. Long after the Duke has been forgotten as well. In the end, he cannot control time or his own mortality. Men will continue to look at and admire the Duchess, who will in turn, continue to smile down at them for eternity. ?|`|S9bEtVCSaa	I'll give you hint - it's about control.

qRx3ynKdaa	In some versions of the story, at some times, yes.    But they get over it, because they can blame it on the love potion. Also in many versions King Mark is rather a nasty sort.    (And Iseult is quite a proper medieval spelling of the name. See for example http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14244 . Isolde is the form found in the medieval poem by Gottfried von Strassburg, which was therefore used by Wagnar. The medieval Welsh forms, Esyllt"" and Essyllt, are closer to Iseult than to Isolde.)|`|I9SiyOhEaa	Don't you mean Tristan and Isolde?  And guilty about what?    Edit:  Doing what?!
AA11244364	You seem to already have a good idea of how to get started! Get involved in as much theatre as possible and apply to do an MA in performing arts/theatre/acting/drama... Many professional performers didn't start out with a theatre-related degree!|`|XXc15qzzaa	Your game plan sounds pretty good so far.  You know the phrase "it's all about who you know"? Well that's true. you need to find an agent. Sell yourself to someone who is respected and then together you need to find your way into some relationships (wow, that makes it sound like prostitution! :) )  But seriously. You'd be surprised who people know and don't be afraid to ask for favors. 6 degrees of separation. not entirely sure that's accurate but it's close. Getting to know lots of people in the industry, making a good impression, and with some of God's help you'll do it if you want it!

One way to get out of this rut, is to surround yourself with trusty and reliable friends or relatives. You will surely get motivation and be positively influenced by them. Make sure you are actively everyday, have some useful and engaging hobbies, or volunteer whatever services you are capable of. Be patient, tolerant and moderate in whatever you do. Identify your real skills and some hidden talents. You will then be absolutely certain what to do tomorrow, next week and beyond. No doubts but a boost of self-confidence.

mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  I love this book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books and it was also recommended by the author of Twilight.     Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    I'm also reading a book right now called Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler. It's about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other, but one day, he dies (somehow which i don't know because i haven't gotten there yet). And also, before, Ivy believed in angels - like an angel for love, etc - but after Tristian's death, she stops beliving in them and thinks she lossed everything.  And because she doesn't believe in angels anymore, she doesn't notice how Tristian's ghost came down as her guardian angel, trying everything to get her to notice him because whoever killed Tristian is after Ivy.  Will he be able to save her in time?  It's suppose to be good    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too. So yeah.. you should check it out|`|AP3mFvnTaa	The Gossip Girl series and the It Girl series. They are surprisingly good and are light reads.

Vuj9VFdmaa	Sword of Truth Series...By Terry Goodkind    Awesome read    Theres eleven books in the series i think...or ten i cant remember but that will keep you going for a couple of months..its magical, a little mythical, romantic, very action    I guess your tastes run the same as mine...im 17 so i was part of the harry potter craze..but these books differ greatly and are definitely not G Rated    Also The Liveship Traders Trilogy is Great         Ship of Magic       The Mad Ship       Ship of Destiny    By Robin Hobb  She also did Two others set in the same world    The Farseer Trilogy:    Assassin's Apprentice  Royal Assassin  Assassin's Quest     And The Tawny Man:    Fool's Errand  Golden Fool  Fool's Fate     Shes an excellent writer.    All of those can be deemed as young adult...but you really need an adults mind to see the deeper meaning    Dont read The Tawny man Before you read the Farseer Trilogy because it follows on in a sense. Not Greatly its fifteen years later in the same province so yeah try to read farseer first if your going to read it at all              Good luck|`|AP3mFvnTaa	The Gossip Girl series and the It Girl series.

I'm not a fan of Blood and Chocolate but people seem to like it. You should read Lord of the Rings or at least the Hobbit.     His Dark Materials by Pullman is good.

PQMRwZNgaa	Well I haven't read Waiting for Godot, but I can tell you existentialist themes in the Stranger! =D; Well fisrtly, the way Meursault acts indifferent to laws and societal norms refers to the authenticity part of existentialism, like when he kills the Arab for no apparent reason except that the sun was irritating him, or when he doesn't mind when his mom dies. To be authentic according to existentialism is to act without influence of law or religion, so he clearly shows this. Also, many existentialists are atheists, and like Meursault explains to the clergyman, he is too. Another theme of existentialism is the absurd, which Camus explores a lot in The Stranger. The absurd is looking for meaning in life when in reality, there is none, and how struggles are useless since we all die in the end while the events of the world have no real or rational order. This is shown in examples like the Czech newspaper, with the irony being that the man who was just trying to surprise his family gets killed by them.   Okay that's pretty much all I got. I hope you liked the Stranger! It's a great book in my opinion. Good luck.
1XRHUCvtaa	We can only know things through classification. Knowledge is always based on a classification system. There is no alternative way of thinking for humans.  It is part of our nature to classify, as humans, which leads us to conflict, which also must be a part of our nature.|`|zZY3JX30aa	We choose to accept (blindly) what we are taught and told, rather than thinking for ourselves. Usually, in order to survive. If we cannot become "members" of the world that is being described to us, we cannot communicate our needs nor understand concepts that may be for our own good and safety.|`|l2IYzaWPaa	we are what we know,what we know is what we are taught. it's a vicious circle!

It wouldn't be pepper, I don't think because salt and pepper go together. I am not positive though. I hope that was a little bit helpful!|`|c7QlTutlaa	My first thought would be sugar; salty and sweet. My second thought would be sour...I'm not sure about sour but it just popped into my head. I disagree that it is pepper, because salt and pepper are made to go together. Especially in cooking. On TV, when you see people seasoning their food, they ALWAYS use salt and pepper first.|`|eQE5BXCCaa	yes it is correect only someone stupid wood not know that|`|FoIxsunVaa	Salt has several opposites    An Acid and a Base make a salt, so separated, acid and base are the opposite of salt.    Salt means "salt of the earth" as in simple, plain, so the opposite would be gold.    Salting something is a preservative, so the opposite of salt would be ROT.    Salt is dry and sugar is sweet. Another kind of opposites.    Salt is light and pepper is dark. But how opposite are they really?|`|AA11635601	No it's not pepper.  I think nouns can't have opposites, but only adjectives and adverbs.  So if it were salty, we could say not salty, but I don't know of a noun that has an opposite.  In fact, I think even when there seem to be two opposites, like wet and dry, we'll find that we could substitute "not-wet" for dry, or "not-dry" for wet, in general, NOT the description is the opposite.  A noun has no opposite.  What is the opposite of a box?  Every other thing?  No thing?    Good question.|`|utJYCCvaaa	well you teacher is probably asking it to see how you think my reply now would be Water because i learned in Chem that when you mix a Acid with a Base you make Salt and Water so i would state that and say Water|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Confuser confusing a confused.|`|AA10729675	sugar|`|AA11736322	salt less.....all other things like sugar ,pepper are complimentary|`|bdeb4da71e553971e11438bdeb0fcdaeaa	I'd say sugar.

It does not have an opposite. What would the opposite of nitrogen be? If pepper was the opposite of salt it would neutralize it. If something is too salty, can you put pepper on it to make it better?  It would be more accurate to say they were compliments to each other.

zZY3JX30aa	Feelings, as in emotions?    Or feelings, as in senses?    = = = =     I can't say why we need emotions, I've never pondered that at any length.    We need our senses to warn us of danger and so wwe can tell when something is "wrong" with us. People with no feeling of pain are always at serious risk.|`|jeGDvHWaaa	to set us apart for animals. Feelings is our only difference. Animals have Instinct. Humans need feelings because feelings make us human.|`|xDlRhatCaa	Humans need feelings because if we didn't, this world wouldn't even be the place it came to be. Sadness, sorrow, fear, hardship, we need all these emotions because it makes up everything. Everything is dependant. You need love and sacrafice and all those emotions. It's just a part of life. Would this world be a good place to live if we didn't have all these feelings? There would be no point for living. Besides, all these feelings are unexplainable and yet they feel good. Pain and anger, sorrow and sadness, if you think about it, it's amazing how we have these feelings.|`|ABhmJepFaa	We need senses to be in contact with reality and survive. Senses are the way in which we receive information about the world that surround us.    Emotions are the way we respond to things according to what we think of them. The same object can generate two different emotions in two different persons because of what that object represents to them.|`|HrsPCzaBaa	To go on living.   Without feeling, or emotion, the world would be as blank as it is to some who looks at it for what it is. We need feeling for simply that, to feel. Without feeling there is no point. We could go on doing, saying, anything. There would be no meaning, no point, no desire to continue on, to live not till life is given up, but taken. To feel is to be alive.|`|4n41tCRgaa	Feelings(senses) are our way of communicating with the world, the way we input reality.

mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  I love this book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books and it was also recommended by the author of Twilight.     Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    I'm also reading a book right now called Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler and it's pretty thick.  Well, it's kind of three books in one.  It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other, but one day, he dies (somehow which i don't know because i havn't gotten there yet).  And also, before, Ivy believed in angels - like an angel for love, etc - but after Tristian's death, she stops beliving in them and thinks she lossed everything, until one day, she realizes Tristian IS her angel.  I'm not that far but like someone killed Tristian and whoever killed him is now after Ivy and Tristian is like a ghost protecting her but when he's finish helping her, he can't be with her anymore and yeah.  It's suppose to be good.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too. So yeah.. you should check it out|`|reyJSRCaaa	Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts is fantastic. A movie is now being filmed with Johnny Depp so read it before that comes out.    The Stand by Stephen in King is excellent especially if you're driving cross country. It's a real horror/thriller with a good story and strong characters.     Tully by Paulina Simons an all-time favorite for a deeper romance-based novel, mainly about a strong yet vulnerable girl.|`|37cb45b81a1a8e20883a8f5a4abfb9a3aa	Bella,    I would suggest that you check out Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter Series.

Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is pretty thick too, although I find most parts of it boring, some parts are good.  The Luxe by Anna Godbersen  The books from the Blue Is For Nightmares Series by Laurie Faria Stolarz.    all of these are great books and pretty bulky.  Also, any book by Sarah Dessen, although her books are so good that you never want to put them down so you'll probably finish pretty fast so I'd suggest you get a few of her books =D    hope I helped.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	I would recommend any book by Tami Hoag.

Your not only dancing with a person on the most important day of her life, your brother'n laws relatives will all be there, your families in laws, mom and dad and to top it all off Your "Dancing With Your Sister" who could probably "kill you and get away with it in a court of law under, justifiable homicide if you mess this up".

You had better get real quick or your sister will blow off the entire idea.  Buddy you only get "one take" live! Get it, Got it, Good!    In one sentence: Get the new soundtrack from "Slumdog Millionaire" and make up a contemporary version of what you see in the movie creating a fusion between that and what you know about traditional dance, choreograph a solo part for yourself and possible consider hiring someone to help you with the staging and making certain that you don't have a big aurgument with your sister on the most important day of her life.    At least with a contemorary music the traditionalist won't know if your doing the steps incorrectly and you'll be breaking some new ground.

ZLWswKHHaa	Why would you think that would improve your image? Method acting is supposed to mimic real life. You are living in reality, so it doesn't really make sense why you would use it. I recommend taking speech classes. That will improve your image tons. Also working on posture, perhaps videotaping yourself to see what you look like to others. These are the things from acting that I find improve people's images. You are taking a very odd approach and I'm not sure it would be effective. You already have an internal dialog in your life. Method acting is trying to get your character to have a natural internal dialog that real people already have. Does that make sense?

QEEweJUaaa	St. Thomas Aquinas, in the thirteenth century, formulated the famous "five ways" by which God's existence can be demonstrated philosophically:     1. The "unmoved mover" argument. We know that there is motion in the world; whatever is in motion is moved by another thing; this other thing also must be moved by something; to avoid an infinite regression, we must posit a "first mover," which is God.   2. The "nothing is caused by itself" argument. For example, a table is brought into being by a carpenter, who is caused by his parents. Again, we cannot go on to infinity, so there must be a first cause, which is God.   3. The cosmological argument. All physical things, even mountains, boulders, and rivers, come into being and go out of existence, no matter how long they last. Therefore, since time is infinite, there must be some time at which none of these things existed. But if there were nothing at that point in time, how could there be anything at all now, since nothing cannot cause anything? Thus, there must always have been at least one necessary thing that is eternal, which is God.   4. Objects in the world have differing degrees of qualities such as goodness. But speaking of more or less goodness makes sense only by comparison with what is the maximum goodness, which is God.   5. The teleological argument (argument from design). Things in the world move toward goals, just as the arrow does not move toward its goal except by the archer's directing it. Thus, there must be an intelligent designer who directs all things to their goals, and this is God.   Two other historically important "proofs" are the ontological argument and the moral argument. The former, made famous by St. Anselm in the eleventh century and defended in another form by Descartes, holds that it would be logically contradictory to deny God's existence. St. Anselm began by defining God as "that [being] than which nothing greater can be conceived." If God existed only in the mind, He then would not be the greatest conceivable being, for we could imagine another being that is greater because it would exist both in the mind and in reality, and that being would then be God. Therefore, to imagine God as existing only in the mind but not in reality leads to a logical contradiction; this proves the existence of God both in the mind and in reality.  Immanuel Kant rejected not only the ontological argument but the teleological and cosmological arguments as well, based on his theory that reason is too limited to know anything beyond human experience. However, he did argue that religion could be established as presupposed by the workings of morality in the human mind ("practical reason"). God's existence is a necessary presupposition of there being any moral judgments that are objective, that go beyond mere relativistic moral preferences; such judgments require standards external to any human mind-that is, they presume God's mind.  Arguments AGAINST God's Existence  Arguments against God's existence have been given by philosophers, atheists, and agnostics. Some of these arguments find God's existence incompatible with observed facts; some are arguments that God does not exist because the concept of God is incoherent or confused. Others are criticisms of the proofs offered for God's existence.  One of the most influential and powerful "proofs" that there is no God proceeds from "The Problem From Evil." This argument claims that the following three statements cannot all be true: (a) evil exists; (b) God is omnipotent; and (c) God is all-loving. The argument is as follows:  - if God can prevent evil, but doesn't, then He isn't all-loving.   - if God intends to prevent evil, but cannot, then He isn't omnipotent.   - if God both intends to prevent evil and is capable of doing so, then how can evil exist?   Another argument claims that the existence of an all-knowing God is incompatible with the fact of free will-that humans do make choices. If God is omniscient, He must know beforehand exactly what a person will do in a given situation. In that case, a person is not in fact free to do the alternative to what God knows he or she will do, and free will must be an illusion. To take this one step further, if one chooses to commit a sin, how can it then be said that one sinned freely?  Hume provided powerful critiques of the main arguments for God's existence. Against the cosmological argument (Aquinas' third argument), he argued that the idea of a necessarily existing being is absurd. Hume stated, "Whatever we can conceive as existent, we can also conceive as nonexistent." He also asked why the ultimate source of the universe could not be the entire universe itself, eternal and uncaused, without a God?|`|c95d0302c2211652aacf54a2a7f7550caa	"When people see some things as beautiful,  other things become ugly.

This is an argument against God that is flawless IF YOU BELIEVE IN EVIL. I can't understand how anybody can believe in God and the Devil or God and Sin or God and Evil. The combination is inconsistent. I personally feel that evil is a myth. God may be a myth too, but it is one I choose to believe in.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	You can't have one without the other; they are the two sides of the same coin.

As for Wildcat's comment that only Romans wore wreaths, that's just plain wrong. Both Greeks and Romans had the tradition. Note however that most people did not run around with these things on their head.

The oil company wants to make money ... wah wah wah     Gas costs money ... wah wah wah     What does "heat or eat" have to do with giving up your car for a year.  That whole question is retarded.  You and your "teacher" (I use that term loosely for the modern liberal agenda-spreaders), have only considered one very small facet of the issue.  So you give up your car for a year ... then what does it cost you to get it running again?  What is the environmental impact of letting it sit and leak fluids into the storm drains?     Do you complain about the impact of iTunes on your food budget?  Do you complain about the impact of your fashion decisions on your food budget?  Do you complain about the amount of taxes that are taken out of your paycheck to provide health services to convicted criminals who would kill you?  Do you complain about the electricity costs to power your computer?  Do you complain about the costs to access the Internet.    Give me a break.  If you want to give up your car ... go for it.  More gas for me.  But here is the thing ... and your leftist teacher won't discuss this because he/she likely has no understanding of what a free market economy really is: by removing demand from the system unnecessarily, you ultimately increase the cost of the product.  Hybrid cars sound like a great idea, but ultimately, when everyone is getting 40+ mpg, the cost of fuel will increase to offset the reduction in demand.  This is basic economics.  When demand is high and supply is low, price goes up.  When demand is low and supply is high, price goes down.  When an artificial barrier is introduced to a market, price ultimately goes up.  If price barriers are introduced, then supply drops and you have shortages.    If you can go for a year without your car, then I would question whether or not you really need one in the first place.  Purchasing a new, more fuel efficient car, is actually worse for the environment than maintaining and driving your old car (what do you think happens to that old car?).      Stop whining.

The greatest man is the one who exerts the maximum influence on history (and people) for the longest amount of time.  No, it's not Jesus.  What about all the jews and muslims in the world?  Besides, Jesus never actually codified or even wrote anything himself, so he relies too heavily upon surrogates.  This is actually the same issue I have with Socrates.    The definitive answer is Plato.  He took the best of what Greek philosophy had to offer and codified it for posterity.

If not, Thorn Birds (Colleen McCullough) is an excellent book with quite a few moral dilemmas in it.  It's about a family in Australia who move on to their Aunt's sheep ranch and help run it.  It deals with the ins and outs of the family and you see the really ugly side of humanity quite a bit.  You also see some of the most beautiful parts of humans, too!  You'd have your pick as to which dilemma you wanted to write and expound on.    You could also pick a book that dealt with the Holocaust.  A very quick read would be "The Hiding Place" by Corrie Ten Boom.  She has a lot to deal with but I don't believe she actually struggled with it too much.  She is portrayed (and probably is) one of those truly "good" people in the world who does what is right.      A book that is more current and deals with more current times would be something by John Grisham.  In "A Time to Kill" you have the lawyers who are torn between doing what is right and defending those that they see innocent and protecting their family.  I believe this book takes place in the 60s.  Something that doesn't have a time line on it would be "The Rain Maker" or "The Firm".  If you choose to use "The Firm", do NOT go off the movie.  The book is so drastically different (and better) that it will be very apparent that you didn't read it.      Good luck!

I used it heavily for an essay on Calvinism at uni and got a very good mark. Euan Cameron, Alister McGrath and Andrew Pettegree have also written very useful books on the reformation.

jf0UV1Bjaa	I just wanted to have my input in this.  To those who answered this question by saying that we killed innocent people by dropping the bomb in japan that had no parts in the war.  That is completely true.  But when a soldier dies, there is some strange reason that makes people feel easier about their death.  When japan attacked pearl harbor, all the enlisted service men were not in war, therefore they were just as innocent as any child or woman or as one person answered a shop keeper.  They had no reason to be attacked what-so-ever.  Japan had every right to be bombed.  And as another person said, that it was just a few people that needed to be killed, and there was only one dictator, the japanese people were well aware of the fact what they did, and all the young men and women went well out of their way to help in the war efforts.  Komakazis were volunteers.  Japan was riding Germany's  coat tail and thought for sure once hitler was done in europe, america would be his next target and japan would have a big continent instead of that island.  Yes they deserved it, twice over.  They took first blood, i just wish we would have nuked them before we lost thousands in the midway islands.

By the time the bombs were dropped Japan was a wreck, they had little military power left, they were dependent on resources from their empire, which was mostly gone.  They could have been cut off and 'starved' so to speak, militarily.

They wanted to go back to things as they were before the war.  When the US fire bombed Tokyo, and 100s of thousands of people died, the Japanese Cabinet did not even discuss it.  They did not care.  An invasion of Japan was estimated to cost a half million american lives and  10 million Japanese lives.    I take this personally.  My father was scheduled to be part of the invasion.  They figured half the men in his division would be dead or wounded in the first three days.  My father would have been dead, 11 years before I was born.

If we fail we die. There are no substitutes.    Civilians at the beginning of war are always held in high esteem, except in "total war." When the "chips" are down and atrocities are encountered, the game and the rules change. War is not a static event. Both morally and strategically.    In a war, there are so many questionable things done... Where was the morality in the bombing of Coventry, or the bombing of Dresden, or the Bataan death march, or the fire bombing of Tokyo and Kobe, or the Rape of Nanking, or the bombing of Pearl Harbor?"    If you have a weapon, and you are fighting for survival, you will tend to use it. Only later are you judged for the consequences of your actions.    At the time, a total war was underway, no 39th parallel, no line in the sand or air space to be denied us....some information was known, other information was filtered or unknown. Various groups were racing to influence decision makers to ensure that the bomb was used (eg. Groves), others were racing to prevent the bomb from being used (eg. Szilard, Einstein).     Some knew of the Japanese "peace feelers", others did not. Given the decisions and the forces pushing and pulling the situation at the time, the fact that a Russian invasion of Northern Japan was imminent, that Siapan and Okinawa did leave high casualty rates, the decision to use the bomb is understandable.    How can we judge decisions made in the context of the time when our minds have been clouded with 60 years of the nightmare of nuclear holocaust hanging over our heads, with the black spectre of nuclear winter and global suicide hanging over every world political decision. Decisions makers did not have the luxury of our 60 years of that dark spectre.

The purpose and effect of the bombs was to cause as much civilian death and devastation as possible in order to intimidate the Japanese government into surrender. This fits the following definition of terrorism: the use or threat of use of violence against noncombatants in order to intimidate or coerce their government into making political concessions.    Some may argue that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were in fact military targets, containing manufacturing facilities, and in the case of Nagasaki a naval base. But then, why were the bombardier aiming points the exact centers of both cities? It would be the functional equivalent of aiming for Staples Center in Los Angeles to take out Raytheon 10 miles to the west and JPL 10 miles to the Northeast, along with hundreds of thousands of civilians in between. Or aiming for downtown Norfolk to take out Norfolk Naval Base 5 miles to the north.    The Japanese islands were totally surrounded, their military was completely destroyed, and there was no hope of resupply. It was physically impossible for them to rebuild their fleet without steel, and even if they did there was no way they could sail without oil. Logistics is the fundamental calculation in war, and the logistical situation for the Japanese was 100% hopeless.

AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet.    Websites that only have family trees are not worth a plug nickel unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.    I recently found I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1956. Hey! we've been dead for 52 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!    I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.    This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.    Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.    Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.    Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.    However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.    Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.    A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.    They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.|`|AA11053540	Here is my short answer:  You should start by asking all your living relatives about family history. Then, armed with that information, you can go to your public library and check to see if it has a genealogy department. Most do nowadays; also, don't forget to check at community colleges, universities, etc. Our public library has both www.ancestry.com and www.heritagequest.com free for anyone to use (no library card required).  Another place to check out is any of the Mormon's Family History Centers. They allow people to search for their family history (and, NO, they don't try to convert you).  A third option is one of the following websites:  http://www.searchforancestors.com/...     http://www.censusrecords.net/?o_xid=2739...     www dot usgenweb dot com/     www dot census dot gov/     http://www.rootsweb.com/     www dot ukgenweb dot com/     www dot archives dot gov/     http://www.familysearch.org/     http://www.accessgenealogy.com/...     http://www.cyndislist.com/     www dot geni dot com/    Cyndi's has the most links to genealogy websites, whether ship's passenger lists, ancestors from Africa, ancestors from the Philippines, where ever and whatever.    Of course, you may be successful by googling: "john doe, born 1620, plimouth, massachusetts" as an example.    Good luck and have fun!    Check out this article on five great free genealogy websites:    www dot associatedcontent dot com/article...    Then there is the DNA test; if you decide you want to REALLY know where your ancestors came from opt for the DNA test. Besides all the mistakes that officials commonly make, from 10% to 20% of birth certificates list the father wrong; that is, mama was doing the hanky-panky and someone else was the REAL father. That won't show up on the internet or in books; it WILL show up in DNA.  I used www.familytreedna.com which works with the National Geographics Genotype Program.    There are many more suggestions. You can start by checking Yahoo! genealogy Answers. And, don't forget to click on the profiles of the top contributors.  Some have their own web sites, with more hints for searching.|`|AA11138176	rootsweb.com is a good site. do a search on ask.com the surname you want to find.You can also go to genealogy.com or ancestry.com there are message boards you can go to also on those sites.You can also check the state your grandparents or great parents lived and type in search like kentucky genealogy last name history or genealogy like I did Blevins Family Genealogy.Something like that.There is a learning center on ancestry.com that you can go to and it will show you where to start|`|KNrXApD5aa	Type in your last name + genealogy or family tree.

OhSCAE0faa	Famous Five  Secret Seven  Twilight  Nancy Drew|`|1urLjIUBaa	The Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia Wrede. The series consists of four novels:    1. Dealing with Dragons  2. Searching for Dragons  3. Calling on Dragons  4. Talking with Dragons    The books are fantasy, with good adventure and plenty of humor. I read the series again about every two years. I know it's a good series for young people because I was student teaching in an 8th grade class when I discovered it. Some of the students recommended it. But so far all the adults I have recommended it to have also enjoyed the novels.    Another very enjoyable book is "Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind" by Ann B. Ross. It's the first book in the Miss Julia series. It very entertaining and heartwarming--and laugh out loud funny!|`|yndz0QbUaa	City of Bones- Cassandra Clare|`|bmmlJ7a1aa	The Host- Stephenie Meyer  Nightworld series- L.J. Smith  Vampire Diaries- L.J. Smith|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  I love this book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Books that move fast and are easy to read would be any book by Tami Hoag.

wFBVuBOkaa	Women used everything they could.    Western states like Wyoming and Colorado allowed women to vote before the turn of the century. In the case of Colorado, this was decided by a vote of males. Wives exercised influence over their husbands, they organized extremely well, and they caught the anti-temperance folks completely by surprise. A lot of the upper-class women in charge of organization made sure to reach out to poor women, and jumped a lot of class lines.    Women nationally and regionally used the image of the mother and the stewardess of the home. If women were supposed to educate effective citizens in their sons, then how could they when they weren't allowed to practice what they taught? Women also argued that they needed to vote in school board elections and for children's issues because that was the domain of their sex.    Look into some of the more radical tactics, too. Some of the suffragists used hunger strikes and pleas to the press to make men sympathetic to their cause. They argued that, as they had no say in the laws, they could not be held responsible for breaking them.    And when all else failed, hey, vote anyway! That's what Susan B. Anthony did, and she got arrested and convicted for voting. They would not allow her to testify in her own defense because she was female. She was allowed to give a sentencing statement, but the judge tried to cut her off early and ordered her to shut up and sit down. She took that order about as well as you would expect.

The three young male heroes are cast away on a small island in the tropics and have to fend for themselves, so the basic setup is the same as LOTF - the way they react and get on is very different though!  Treasure Island is about one boy and his adventures among adults totally different.

ceBTTCPwaa	Push is not an easy novel to read, it tells the story of Precious a 16 year old girl who by the age of 16 had two children, both fathered on her by her own father.     This is her story, the story of a girl with a limited education, a girl abused by both her parents, her father who sexually abuses her and her mother who mentally abuses her, for her mother is jealous that her husband shows their daughter attention that she sees as being rightfully hers.     There is no redemption here for any of the characters, no cure or salve for what has happened to the main protagonist, she has only her will to survive and the love she has for her children, both born out of rape but still people in their own right.     A disturbing novel that is strangely addictive as it compels you to go from page to page in a bid to come to the end of story that should never have been told.     An amazing read that sure as heck doesn't have the feel good factor built into it.

dMGorRVIaa	Hey! I'll try to help you to the best of my ability, I've done quite a few shows myself. I don't know if you are in high school / middle school, a boy / girl, or what production you're auditioning for, but I'll try. :-)    1. Wear something you can move in easily (I'm assuming there is some sort of dance audition since it is a musical). I always wear a black, form fitting shirt (not slutty tight, just nice looking), with a pair of black "jazz" pants (Either that or a pair of nice, black slacks, or a longish skirt), with a pair of easy to move in shoes (jazz shoes or flats, etc). Look nice, but not uncomfortable or too "over the top". Black is best because it gives you a clean slate.     2. Be yourself. Pay attention during other peoples auditions and don't talk or be rude (your teacher will notice). Just be polite and respectful.    3. If your teacher didn't ask you to start from the top, which may be expected, start from a point at the beginning of the verse/chorus that shows your vocal range the best.    4. It doesn't look lame at all. Write down any and all performing experience you have. Something is better than nothing at all!    5. You're makeup should be fine, just be yourself, and look nice (see above clothing note)    6. Wear whichever you wear normally and your teacher is used to seeing you in. I personally have that same problem, and tend to wear contacts to auditions simply because more than likely you'll be asked to wear them on stage anyhow.    7. Props are a big no. Don't give any choreography to your song either. Just be relaxed, and move with the song, not necessarily "casually", but don't be all overdramatic. Just relax and move with the song.      You're questions don't sound stupid at all. Just relax, have fun, be confident, and be yourself! Even if you aren't confident, even if you mess up while singing or dancing, the best advice I can give you is to keep going and just fake it. Pretend you didn't mess up and smile! Don't let the nerves get to you (ha, yeah right, I know), but if you tell yourself you're confident, you will be. Don't let other people psych you out.    Sorry, now I'm rambling. Best of luck!|`|GR2XNzCCaa	I suggest to wear something similar to the character, but still close to what you usually wear.  Just walk in calmly but keep your back straight. Confidence is key.  I believe it would be easier to start at the beginning, because it will make it more recognizable and if you are going to have a cd made for auditions with just the music and no voice, starting at the beginning will be less complicated.  Go ahead and put them on unless you have any more recent experience. That would be better, but since this is just school, she should be fine with the age as long as you prove yourself in the audition.  Just wear your daily makeup nothing fancy. Your face should be a blank page that your teacher could imagine anything happening with makeup wise.  If you find your glasses more comfortable wear those because facial expressions are a big part of acting. You can also mention you have contacts to your teacher though.  No props unless they are absolutely necessary.|`|HeJf5KYgaa	The answer to most of these questions really lie in what show you're auditioning for and what role.
9qYU2R2Daa	You can get the ancestry by DNA test. It is the autosomal test and the company is DNA tribes. This will give you a broader picture of your genetic makeup from all your ancestors five generations back. I have had this one and it is more informative than the mito & y test(maternal&paternal lineage) The mito test goes back too far and only tells you your haplogroup 150,000 years ago when your ancestors came out of Africa. For instance if it is J haplogroup it would  indicate ancestors that branched off and settled in Northern Iran but this doesn't specifiy  recent  Arabic ancestry.  Go for the Autosomal test. Good luck !|`|AA11138176	To me it sounds like Scandinavian but you could find out more information by doing your family history  research and also by genetic testing.DNA testing also.Look up your parents surnames their parents ,and your great grandparents.Family history research is fun I have been doing it for over 3 years now.Genealogy research shows you more than you think and lots of fun doing it.|`|AA11053540	Since you said "genetically", the obvious answer is DNA testing, to include both mtDNA (female to female) and yDNA (male to male).  Males can be tested for both types; women can only be tested for mtDNA. Males receive mtDNA from their mothers, but cannot pass it on.    Based on your description, your physical characteristics are classic Irish!    But, try a DNA test.  I used www.familytreedna.com, the world's oldest, best, and largest such. They also do DNA testing for the National Geographic Genotype Programs, which traces human migration patterns worldwide.|`|KU9n8bVcaa	There's no way to determine this from the information you gave.    You are a mix of British, Scottish and Irish as it sounds like, but you cannot determine beyond that.    The best way to figure out your roots is to do research on your last name. Perhaps you can talk to some of your older relatives and try to trace back your family tree as far as possible.    As far as your physical characteristics, these do not determine one certain race or another. You are of European descent and are a mix of several different main countries. If you research your family tree further back you will likely determine that you are from an even broader mix of heritages, rather than single it down to one single one.     Be proud that you have many rich heritages in your past!|`|7ONKVbbiaa	there are 2 ways to get information about your ancestors..  one is genealogy, which is the process of using documents and records, to identify specifically who were your parents, grandparents, etc. In 99% of situations, your physical characteristics will have nothing to do with where that goes. What you describe could be Scandinavian as well as the British Isles, etc.   DNA testing uses your dna to define what are called haplogroups. These are broad definitions of persons/ cultures, etc. This info goes further back, is much broader, probably predates records.. and will not tell you anything PERSONAL, like names. In some instances (dna projects), persons with a same surname can compare dna with what they already have in paper trail, and confirm or disprove what they have concluded.   You can do both, they are not exclusive.   What you posted is not enough for anyone here to conclude anything. You still have to either research, or have dna tests done.  edit  Peter, I have nearly 30 yrs genealogical research experience, so I have understanding of the topic.   Both means of what is offered, ARE specific. What neither one does is rely on on suggestions, but require evidence from one source or the other. ANYTHING that is not using a reliable source is simply guessing, which is completely contrary to the purposes of research.|`|hAFxcxP0aa	There's no way to determine this from the information you gave.

Perhaps you can talk to some of your older relatives and try to trace back your family tree as far as possible.

As a male you can have both Y & Mtdna tested, so from both your parent's sides of the family.

When you get the kit, all you have to do is swab the inside of your mouth, put the swabs back in the kit, and send the kit back.  In turn, they will send you the test results and you will see names of people and locations who you may match genetically with or are cousin families.  The results will amaze you.    Once you get your results, you can post them to the world's largest y DNA database, www.yesarch.org.    I hope this was helpful.    Sue

When you saw him again with only a tail it could very well mean he is overly controlling his excitement, or holding back his urges as a means to please those around him.

ceBTTCPwaa	"A Rose for Emily" is a short story by American author William Faulkner first published in the April 30, 1930 issue of Forum. This story takes place in Faulkner's fictional city, Jefferson, in his fictional county of Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. It was Faulkner's first short story published in a national magazine.    Faulkners "A Rose For Emily" is told from the viewpoint of an anonymous resident of Jefferson, Mississippi, where the Grierson family was the closest thing to true aristocracy. The story presents a powerful argument that privilege can sometimes be a prison. To the outside world, it might have appeared that Miss Emily Grierson grew up in the lap of luxury. However, it was a lonely existence, for her father ruled Emilys life with an iron fist, turning away every suitor the young girl had; no one was good enough for his daughter. Not surprisingly, the first thing Emily did after her fathers death was to find a boyfriend, and a very unlikely one at that -- a Yankee day laborer named Homer Barron. She went out driving with Homer in a flashy yellow-wheeled buggy, and bought him extremely personal articles -- a silver toilet set, a nightshirt. Today our first assumption would be that he was her lover, but this was the small-town South, and another time. The townspeople assumed she had gotten married -- secretly, of course, because under the circumstances a big society wedding would be in bad taste. For a while Emily convinced herself that the townspeople still respected her. After all, she never really intended Homer to supplant her father in the eyes of the town. He couldnt have, because he was neither a Son of the South nor a pillar of the community; Homers role was simply that of a consort, filling a vacancy at Emilys side. But when Emily learned Homer was gay, she realized his presence would cause her to be pitied and laughed at. This she could not abide, so he had to go. Who else but a Grierson would be able to stroll into the pharmacy, demand arsenic, and refuse to explain what she intended to use it for? How could the townspeople have failed to notice that shortly thereafter, Emilys lover disappeared, never to be seen again? How could they have failed to connect Homers disappearance with the terrible smell that emanated from the Grierson house? The logical conclusion -- that Emily had murdered her lover -- could not be incorporated into the myth that the townspeople had constructed around her. It was unspeakable, so no one spoke of it. Forty years later, after Emily died, the townspeople cautiously entered the house that few had visited since the death of Mr. Grierson. There they were moved, but not really surprised, to find Homers skeletal body on a sumptuous bed in a locked room, Emilys iron-gray hair lying on the pillow beside his head. In "A Rose for Emily," Faulkner shows the tragedy that results from our adherence to social roles that constrain, rather than liberate, our true selves.    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.bookrags.com/A_Rose_for_Emily    http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...|`|AA12095483	Yankee is the old fashioned word for someone from the Northern US - most particularly, the northeastern states.

Summary    This story is narrated through a third person's point of view.  The story is told from the townspeople. The story starts off with Ms. Emily's funeral. It states that "the men through a sort of respectful affection for a fallen monument, the women mostly out of curiosity to see the inside of her house, which no one save an old man-servant--a combined gardener and cook--had seen in at least ten years."

He stated the first version of the law of conservation of mass,[2] recognized and named oxygen (1778) and hydrogen (1783), abolished the phlogiston theory, helped construct the metric system, wrote the first extensive list of elements, and helped to reform chemical nomenclature. He discovered that, although matter may change its form or shape, its mass always remains the same. Thus, for instance, if water is heated to steam, if salt is dissolved in water or if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged. He was also an investor and administrator of the "Ferme Gnrale" a private tax collection company; chairman of the board of the Discount Bank (later the Banque de France); and a powerful member of a number of other aristocratic administrative councils. All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research. Because of his prominence in the pre-revolutionary government in France, he was beheaded at the height of the French Revolution.

8yE2sYGeaa	It gives up an opportunity to get material possessions, which we feel give us happiness|`|F5v5Qme0aa	The guy who said money doesn't buy you happiness was obviously never broke. Of course money makes us happy. In our society we need it to obtain not only necessities, but also luxuries that make us feel good. But it's important to remember than money only gets you "stuff". It can't buy the important things like respect or love and if you think about it, those are the things that make us happy... not the stuff. It's said that the richest man is the one who needs the least - I like that thinking.  :-D|`|eDySIDPQaa	Money is a hollow happiness, cause it can't save your life when your time is up on this ole earth, and it cannot keep love in your life.    It can make life easier for us all,and when you are given money, it just does something to warm the heart, it is food in your frig, it's clothes on your back, it's a good education for you or your children, it's in knowing that you have security.......it's the outreached hands of those that do not have money (the joy of giving to someone that really needs money.....    Helping support others that can't support themselves.    Legit:;It's the foundation of outreached caring and giving, ever look into a child's eyes that is in an Orphanage at Christmas and you have the money to buy that child gifts, or even be able to adopt that child, the child's eyes does it all for you....Your heart is giving love, the money is giving support and care...|`|6qsTmMQaaa	I was thinking about this while my dad was driving me to school this morning, and I think that it can be seen in two ways:    1) The money that we receive makes us happy, for we know that we will be able to buy things that we wanted or have wanted for a while, and knowing that makes us happy.    2) The money itself doesn't make us happy, but it's what we can buy with the money that makes us happy. We can buy a bicycle, or a car, or even a house, and those things will make us happy.    There are really two different ways of looking at this. Some people might find that the money itself makes them happy, for they can buy something they want, or build up to buying something they want (i.e. a house or a car). Some, on the other hand, might find that what they are able to buy with the money makes them happy, and the money is just a step towards their goal.    Number two is the most common in my family, for my two youngest sisters don't really understand the importance of how money works yet, and how you have to work to get the money, and it doesn't just come to you.    Some people might see this differently, but this is just what I believe. Agree or disagree, it's my opinion.|`|ubofHDxPaa	Ask Elvis Presley. or Anna Nicole Smith.|`|kF9aHWfUaa	The things it makes us buy,achieve make us happy.|`|Fed34ceuaa	i think that it isnt the fact that a person is giving money to us...its the thing makes us happy (not the amount). would a rich kid be really happy if he or she was $50 dollars just like that? i dont think so, he or she would consider it normal but would a poor or average classed person be happy that they are going to recieve $50, i am pretty sure they would, you know your additional details make complete sense. sometimes i think that maybe it isnt the money, it is the fact that we are GETTING the money...does that make sense.... sort of|`|m7M6DYnaaa	It gives us a rush, but like you said Run Wild, it is a feeling that is only temporary.

I was able to go anywhere in the world I wanted and have amazing adventures. I brought my self a nice house and spent over a year doing it up to exactly how I wanted it which was great fun. I brought a boat and went travelling around the mediteranean with my friends. I was able to buy  myself horses, which has always been my dream and I love them very much, they give me so much pleasure.    Life is a lot happier when you can wake up in the morning and say "I want to do that today" without any restrictions.    Money means you can fufull your dreams and desires.    I am deffinatly much happier with money, having to worry about how the bills will be paid, and not affording a holiday isnt my idea of happiness!!!|`|mppB9ebgaa	Humans enjoy instant gratification. Money can provide that. Whether or not this kind of happiness is appropriate or not can be debated. Long term affects usually can be found if you get whatever you wanted. Some become spoiled and snobby. I believe that true happiness can only be found when it is shared with those around us.|`|XQvJUz7waa	Money directly doesn't give us happiness, but the stuff it buys does. Like electronics, cars, and girlfriends. Yes, i said girlfriends, they are expensive these days!@!|`|wIUtt9woaa	When people say this kind of "happiness" they arent just talking about something making you happy. They mean happiness that is long term leads to a peaceful life. Sure money makes you happy, but what happens when its gone? You might enjoy whatever you spent it on for a while, then it will get old and you will feel unhappy again. For example there can be this rich person who has all the money in the world, they are a stuck up person who only cares about themselves, and usually ends up alone and without someone to care for by the end. This person may buy things that make them feel better, but in the end they are still alone and unhappy.  To be completely happy, you must feel happy physically, emotionally, and mentally. So pretty much i agree......and best answer if you totally agree with me...? lol|`|va8quhPtaa	may not buy happiness,but it makes you to do some thing confidently.|`|4n41tCRgaa	Our society is based on a reward system.  Money represents praise for a job well done.  It is a validation.  Money, in this day and age, also satisfies the primal need for security.

That is what our value system has evolved over thousands of years. Unless your goal in life is to amass money for the sheer love of IT, most people confuse what they feel (relief) when they get some of that 'precious' commodity with what they think they feel (happiness). As some probably rich man said, "the best things in life are free" but our greedy self-absorbed society has tossed that truly precious value system into the collective human toilet.|`|KbnUq585aa	Besides paying for the necessities, money and what it can buy allow us the fleeting sensations of superficial pleasures that aren't ultimately satisfying because nothing is ever completely satisfying; because everything is insecure, prey to elements beyond our control. Material pleasures are a welcome respite, a distraction, from the reality that our fears can come true and there's not enough  we can really do about it. Money can't protect and preserve anything forever.(No, I don't think it's all hopeless; I just don't see much value in some peoples' attempts to amass so much power or mega bonuses in hopes of making more of themselves to satisfy their inflated egos.)|`|NCt6VrLLaa	Money provides us with the ability to do things that make us happy and as the saying goes" money is not everything but without money we cannot do anything" Thus we view money as an item towards happiness and as human greed takes over we slowly derive happiness in money itself.    However from my point of view it is not being rich that makes you happy but how you spend your riches that would make you truly happy. Eg, a man who earns 1m a year but constantly worries on how to get more money will be less happy than one who earns 1k a year but makes good use of it and is satisfied with what he has.|`|T1beLIQqaa	Being free to have what you want, when you want it, is what happiness is all about. When money can make this possible, you will be happy, when it can not, no matter how much there is/isn't(i.e.-loss of life of a loved one), it can not. In other words, whatever fulfills your desires, IS what makes you happy. Money(any amount) will not do this for many people.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Actually you have asked this in a most clever way that I have not seen before. Money promises good fun and better days, but it comes with strings attached, you have to work to get it, the government wants it's piece and every shopkeeper has his or her eye on your wallet.

4IjWMOGcaa	Most of them didn't -- hence the relatively stagnant pace of knowledge among common people at the time. Illiteracy in the 17th Century was very high and most people only knew what was carried by word-of-mouth and rumor by those few who traveled from town to town, namely soldiers, traveling artisans, and merchants. Scholars and nobility had access to printing presses and were able to print pamphlets or at least write letters which served as their main method of communication. Historians mainly look at official documents which were kept by courts and private letters certain high-profile people wrote to one another.|`|WY1DbYv0aa	Daloriens, planes, and the internet.|`|E1OusFBqaa	Depends on where people lived. But in general in terms of Europe and the American colonies there were newspapers. The London Gazette is one of the longest running newspapers and has been in various forms since the 1660's. By 1700 in the Colonies each of the Colonies had some form of newspaper. At the time in both Europe and the Colonies they were not accurate news as we think of it today, but a way to share, advice on crops, home remedies, recipes etc. with a smattering of world events, and then smaller local events,    Books existed as well of course, but as full books and not leaflets or small publications were expensive and person who were well to do prided themselves on having libraries. Remember the printing press had come about in the 1300's and later the Renaissance and the Reformation highly encouraged writing and reading. Art and religion encouraged the next age of the 18th century known as the Age of Reason.     The literacy rate of the 17th century was low in comparison to today. But was high compared to the that of the Medieval era. Information still spread slowly but not as slowly as it once had. Most people of the middling sort (middle class) could read at least a little, if one could not read then news, then info was collected at public gatherings such as taverns and markets, church and town events. Where ever people gather news and info is spread. As true then as now!|`|3YKUrlvoaa	by stories told that has been passed on and from scriptures written from people in the 17 th century.  Another way is from fossils...|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Literacy in the 17th century (at least in England) was only about 30%,so although books,newsletters,and especially pamphlets were available, people's main source of information was the Sunday sermon read by the pastor at the local church.The vast majority of people (something like 99%) attended Sunday service.As the church was Anglican,and thus state controlled,the pastor often got the theme for his sermon from influential local and government magnates;it was his job to put forward the 'official' version of current events, and support this with extracts from the Bible.(The same system was used in Catholic countries and churches on the continent).   Another popular method was friends,extended families or sometimes even a whole village gathering together to hear someone literate read aloud a book,tract,newsletter or pamphlet.   Thus,the gathering,interpretation and discussion of information in the 17th century was very much a shared community experience,unlike today where we sit alone in front of our TVs or computer screens reading only the news stories that interest us...|`|AA11666466	i dunno...

Also, during the Middle aAges when that started, through the Rennassance, and then the age of Enlightenment, there was a rekindling of higher knowledge of Citizenship rights in Europe enjoyed during the time of Rome that no longer existed during the Dark Ages that followed, but finally were dusted off, thanks first to the power of the Catholic Church..|`|b7ae34ab971653d02308ce805affb7baaa	Lord Percy is right - It is a constitutional Monarchy not a Democratic Republic. The effect is much the same however. They have an elected Prime Minister and a head of state (Queen) and a House of Lords instead of a Senate (Though Australia has a Senate and it is also a constitutional Monarchy).  The move towards the democracy happened in stages starting with  Anglo Saxon legal systems, the Magna Carta, various acts of Parliament and Royal decrees over many centuries.|`|DfX5lFjkaa	The move from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy in the United Kingdom occurred over several centuries. It started in 1066, following the Norman conquest of Britain, when William I set up the first Parliament. Then in 1215, King John was forced by the nobles to sign Magna Carta which protected certain rights of all subjects, most notably the writ of habeas corpus which allowed appeal against unlawful imprisonment.    In 1649, King Charles I was executed on order of parliament for raising taxes, dissolving parliament for years and starting a civil war. The monarchy was replaced by a republic headed by Oliver Cromwell who proved to be a worse dictator than any King. After Cromwell's death, Charles II (son of the executed monarch) was asked by parliament to become King.    In 1685, Charles II died without an heir and his brother, James II, became King. James proved to be as tyrannical as his father, and in 1689 parliament removed him from power and asked Mary II (James daughter) and her husband William of Orange to become King and Queen. It was at this point that Britain became a constitutional monarchy as parliament insisted that almost all executive power, including powers over taxation, be given to parliament, leaving the monarch as a figurehead.    The final step in Britains move to becoming a full constitutional monarchy took place in 1721, under George I, when a single parliamentarian (Robert Walpole) became head of government in the office of First Lord of the Treasury, which later became known as Prime Minister.|`|WLizHwtkaa	As has been said, Britain is not a republic it's a kingdom (specifically, it's the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northen Ireland). However, the monarch has no effective political power, and the tiny powers she (or he) does have can be removed at a stroke by the democratically elected Parliament. Actually, Britain is an elected autocracy. Once elected the government can (and does) do whatever they like, and there's absolutely nothing the people can do about it unless and until the Prime Minister decides to call an election. By convention he (or she) is required to do so at least every five years, but there is no law in Britain that says they must.    The British governmental and legal systems have evolved slowly over hundreds of years from the signing of the Magna Carta. However, Britain still has no written constitution and no bill of rights. In fact, there is very little that's republican in Britain today. And long may it stay that way.|`|50zbKv0jaa	it isn't its a constitutional monarchy|`|AA11304025	Who teaches you history?

ff8360bbad7e2c4a7cfcde28783d6ac9aa	Si cada persona es un accidente, algo tuvo que haber provocado dicho accidente (alguna clase de energa).  Si Dios nos cre, entonces Dios nos cre.    Sea cual sea tu punto de vista (independientemente de que creas o no en Dios) el hecho es que TU no creaste a esa persona. Ni siquiera sus padres la crearon, slo permitieron que fuera creada. Es igual para el caso en el que alguien sea creado por medio de la biotecnologa. L unico que un cientfico puede hacer (por ahora) es introducir un espermatozoide dentro del vulo, pero el ADN se combina al azar a partir de una peque?a descarga elctrica, sin intervencin del hombre (lo nico que puede hacer es iniciar la combinacin).   Y por ms que en un futuro la ciencia sea capaz de intervenir en la combinacin de las secuencias de ADN, hay que tener en cuenta las experiencias vividas por dicha persona.     Por lo tanto, una persona es el resultado de algo intangible que combina las secuencias de ADN (Dios, energa vital, suerte, "La Fuerza", o como quieras llamarla), del medio en el que vive y de las experiencias vividas desde su creacin.    Por lo tanto, dado que no tuviste intervencin en la creacin TOTAL de la vida de dicha persona, no tienes derecho alguno a quitrsela.|`|6e691b97d37ef6d70a7347b16e2fea2faa	Y si el hombre no es ninguna de las cosas que decis?

Y si solo somos creaciones propias?  Tal vez uno tiene que creer en algo porque no puede vivir con el enigma.  El creyente que dios existe, el ateo que dios no existe.  Tal vez ni exista ni no exista  Y en el hipotetico caso que descubriesemos que no existe seria valido matar porque si?  pensaste lo que propones?  Y si existe porque va a matar a la gente sin razon?

Ahora bien, filosficamente las razones son ms profundas. Van ms all del sentido comn (que tambin es vlido). Se trata ms bien de reconocer que la vida como posibilidad de accin es valiosa por s misma, y que no hay justicia ni ley que admita como ticamente correcto despojar a una persona de su existencia.

c835a6a7cd1fa0dddecc06c4f8a63831aa	Homicdio, por defini??o do artigo 121, do Cdigo Penal  "matar algum". A prpria defini??o do crime n?o pede que haja um motivo. Mas, a exce??o de sua punibilidade (ou seja, o motivo que pode absolver um "assassino") exige um motivo: a legtima defesa (sua mesmo ou de outra pessoa). Para a a??o de "matar algum", o Cdigo Penal traz algumas hipteses que pioram (se  que isso  possvel) o crime: impossibilitar a defesa da vtima; conquistar-lhe a confian?a para efetuar o crime; usar de meio cruel (como o emprego de fogo, tortura, etc), dentre outros.   A lei  resultado da manifesta??o da moral da sociedade que regula. Ou seja, observando a legisla??o em vigor e regularmente aplicada em um pas, voc consegue ter uma idia bastante real do que se passa na cabe?a da popula??o daquele pas em geral.   A nossa diz algo bastante claro: salvo para salvar a prpria vida, ou a de outra pessoa, n?o interessa porque algum mata.  Eu sou advogada e quando fazia faculdade, numa aula de Penal em que discutamos exatamente o artigo 121, um colega comentou que todo motivo para mater algum (salvo a j repetida legtima defesa)  torpe e vil (ou seja  cruel, banal, nada demais).  Eu concordo com ele. Pense nisso: o que, se n?o salvar a prpria vida, ou a de outra pessoa, justificaria matar outra? Cimes? Inveja? dio? Voc v nesta rela??o algum sentimento nobre (e que n?o se fale que as pessoas matam por Amor, porque n?o matam. Quem ama de verdade  incapaz de fazer o mal ao ser amado, ou aos seus. Se mata por cime, inveja, intolerancia, nunca por amor, nem mesmo a Deus) e que justifique a morte de um ser humano?  Se para a lei, e para os homens que fizeram essa lei, n?o h motivo justificvel para a morte de outra pessoa (salvo, de novo, a legtima defesa), por que haveria um para o cometimento de assassinatos?  N?o h e nunca vai haver. Podemos, para confortar nossas mentes e acreditar que n?o h o ser humanos simplesmente mau, arrumar um, mas, acredite, eles n?o existem. As pessoas matam porque matam. Sempre mataram e sempre v?o matar.|`|061ca71db22340379748366f66ae6148aa	As vezes  por dinheiro, ou por vingan?a ou at s para ver o sofrimento da pessoa porque n?o existe s pessoas boas, sabia?|`|6379c123b6104ff2a3d80b862e1eb5b8aa	Jesus disse que quando estivesse perto do fim da iniquidade, era quando tudo ia ficar cada vez mais difcil e pior.

Esses indivduos agem dessa forma porque tm a certeza que "n?o d nada".  Se esses indivduos fossem feitos exemplo e pagassem pelo seu crime da mesma forma que mataram, o problema seria resolvido rpida e eficazmente, mas isso n?o pode ser feito porque os malditos grupos dos direitos humanos que s consideram bandidos como humanos, sem considerar que o vagabundo n?o reconheceu nenhum dos direitos humanos da vtima, entram pesado na defesa dessas Bestas do apocalpse.  bandido tem direito de matar mais de cem pessoas s para fazer acordo com governador para assistir a copa em tv de plasma, mas as "pessoas" n?o tm o direito de matar esses bandidos.

0120a120b62d1ca4e803fea14c53a2afaa	I loved The Secret History even though it took at least 100 pages for me to really get into it...When I tried to read The Little Friend, everyone I knew who had (tried to) read it said they didn't like it, so maybe I was really negative to start with.    I never finished it for 2 reasons.    1-- I kept reading and reading and it didn't seem to go anywhere.  2-- Someone told me that at the end, you don't really find out "whodunnit," but that the mystery was given away in the beginning but most people don't catch on...  So I got frustrated, thinking I missed this clue.  I reread the beginning and I skipped to the end and read the ending (which I virtually never do)  and...DOES Donna reveal who killed the little brother?  So...that's why I think it sucks.|`|b3fbb32ff2ef99a7b902417e965ff65baa	Well, I didn't think The Little Friend was all THAT bad, but I'll agree with you when you say The Secret History was great. Part of the appeal of The Secret History was that it drew you into this mysterious, isolated world. The Little Friend took place in Mississippi, hardly a new setting for a novel. Another problem is that Ms. Tartt writes The Little Friend as an exploration of the effects of a gruesome murder on a young child, when really she would've been better off writing it as a straight-up mystery novel. There's just not as much excitement or intrigue in The Little Friend, especially when compared to The Secret History (which is another problem with The Little Friend; she set the bar so high the first time it'd be nigh impossible to even come close). It's just dull really. Although I still kind of liked it. Can't wait for her third one!|`|b3580cf3c74dbe3fb9ce60fb4b5a2c27aa	I'm guessing no one's read Donna Tartt...lol!
d2847e100d48f2b0266c4043e2d70d89aa	Dicen que la Historia se conjuga con el sudor de las gentes, sus palabras y sus haza?as, annimas, siempre. Dicen que la Historia es el enga?o del tiempo, la jugarreta final del destino, slo reservada a los ms grandes. Dice la Historia que James Joyce naci en Dubln el 2 de febrero de 1882. Hijo del alcoholismo y la pobreza, hijo de la vieja Irlanda, del Dubln galico, del olvidado mundo de los gigantes, del tiempo ignoto.    Estudi en los jesuitas, recibi premios de poesa (que se gast en invitar a una gran cena), bebi durante toda su vida, termin sus das ciego y con varias lceras... Unos dicen que fue el mejor escritor desde Homero, otros dicen que su pluma est ms all de este mundo, otros dicen que termin loco, que su escritura es slo un ejemplo de un hombre esquizofrnico. La Historia habla, y 1922 es la fecha en la que se public el libro ms famoso del S. XX: Ulises.    Cuentan que Nora (su Penlope) y Joyce se escriban cartas muy subidas de tono, que estaba obsesionado con los fluidos corporales y el sexo, cuentan tambin que es un ateo profundamente religioso, un hombre culto de psimo gusto, un irlands universal.    La Historia, como bien dicen algunos, se escribe con la pluma de los annimos, con el tenue caminar de Stephen Dedalus, Ajax, Leopold Bloom, Aquiles, Ulises... La Historia cambia el tiempo y convierte lo ignorado en texto, porque son las palabras la fuente ltima y primera del conocimiento. Ms all, slo la muerte.    James Joyce es el escritor que, viviendo una vida en el exilio, convirti la vieja Irlanda mtica en un universo estable y cambiante (Ulises), que describi la vida de las gentes de Dubln (Dublineses), que relat su propio nacimiento y condena (Retrato de un Artista Adolescente), que vivi una y mil vidas en el sue?o de un beodo (Finnegans' wake).    Hablar del estilo literario de Joyce es intentar describir una nota, impropio. Es el escritor sobre el que se han vertido ros de tinta, y nadie ha dicho nada. Joyce comparaba el monlogo interior en el ltimo captulo de Ulises (Penlope) con el fluir de un ro, que se entrega en una duermevela al sue?o del mundo... El libro, concluye con la palabra ms simple y compleja (siempre impropio e inabarcable en cualquiera de las traducciones al castellano): Yes... Soniridad, msica de nuevo... Alguien dijo que Ulises era msica. El estilo de Joyce es por ello un estilo cambiante, imitativo y nuevo, reflexivo por el mismo nacimiento de la palabra, en su juego eterno.    Precisamente muchos lectores se quedan tan slo en los juegos de palabras (actitud sin duda promovida por esa caterva de crticos ignorantes, muertos)... Leer a Joyce es entregarse a un mundo nuevo en el que, como bien sugera Cortzar, hay que dejar atrs la propia historia para escribir la Historia. Leer a Joyce es caer en el metalenguaje, la metaliteratura, es sumergirse en el ocano profundo de las palabras, hallar un significado nuevo en cada uno de sus significantes, perder la nocin del tiempo y encontrar un segundo nuevo, una nota, una escala en cada nuevo captulo.    Decenas de crticos trataron de explicar Ulises, cientos de ellos lo han intentado ms tarde... Historia, historia...    Joyce comenz escribiendo poesa (Msica de Cmara, 1907). Un libro de poemas de amor. Su siguiente novela, un fresco sobre la vida (Dublineses, 1914), ahonda en el concepto de epifana (procedimiento literario de revelacin interior a travs de instantneas de la vida, palabra, imgenes) que ms tarde pasara a llamarse epiclesis (forma ms desarrollada de la epifana). Dublineses es una coleccin de relatos, s, pero es una novela en s misma con un nico personaje: Dubln.   Ms tarde, y esbozada anteriormente en Stephen el Hroe, comienza con las aventuras de Stephen Dedalus en Retrato del Artista Adolescente (1916). Surge el verdadero Joyce, cambiante, resultn, expresivo, abnegado, autontemplativo, un torrente verbal de tonalidades cambiantes. Es la historia de un chico, el mismo Joyce, que estudia en los jesuitas, que descubre la tica de Santo Toms, que mira el mundo de los prostbulos y desciende hasta el ocano de las palabras. Cinco captulos en los que el lenguaje es un personaje ms y se convierte en la expresin del alma del hroe (Stephen Dedalus). El lenguaje evoluciona con el protagonista, cambia, es inocente y vacuo al principio; profundo, filosfico y pedregoso en su desarrollo medio; pasional, etreo, enamoradizo y vergonzante ms tarde; libre y sincero cuando Dedalus llega al final de su camino: Joyce est listo para escribir Ulises.      Ulises (1922) es la obra de un hombre que abandon Irlanda y es la obra del que jams la abandon. Es un retrato de la vida en aquellos principios de siglo (ya pasado, siempre presente), en el que dos personajes (el mismo Stephen Dedalus y Leopold Bloom) conviven a travs de las peripecias de un da (bautizado posteriormente El da de Bloom o Bloom's day), 16 de junio de 1904, da en el que Joyce y Nora (segn cuenta la leyenda inspirada en palabras del propio autor) tuvieron su primera y fatdica cita. Ulises narra la vida de estos dos personajes (y en menor medida de la esposa de Bloom, Molly) este da. Mediante procedimientos varios y basado en la estructura de La Odisea (de ah el nombre de la obra) es un retrato de los pensamientos y acciones de estos dos hombres, imgenes de juventud y madurez del propio Joyce. El libro es redundante y nunca repetitivo, nuevo y clsico en su estructura. Cada captulo ahonda en una funcin del cuerpo humano y en un rgano, cada captulo usa un procedimiento literario diferente, cada captulo es un mundo, y el universo, en dos personajes, en dos culturas, en dos religiones (juda, Bloom, y catlica, Dedalus). Se habla del uso del monlo|`|8dfd38a5d1be3446bd62d58ec2b2c826aa	Es el protagonista de "Retrato de un artista adolescente" de James Joyce...|`|639e052809f5ca208541cac8f39a27d1aa	LA respuesta es "personaje de Joyce"pero ah esta una explicacin:  Stephen Dedalus was James Joyce's literary alter ego, as well as the central protagonist of two of his early works: Stephen Hero, and Joyce's semi-autobiographical novel of artistic existence A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Dedalus also plays a significant role in Joyce's masterpiece Ulysses, a novel based on the events of Homer's Odyssey.    In Stephen Hero, we find the surname written as "Daedalus," an immediate allusion to the Greek figure. Upon significantly revising the mammoth Stephen Hero text into the much more compact A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce opted to shorten the name to "Dedalus" for the sake of realism (the notion of finding a turn of the century Dubliner with the precise Greek surname slightly laughable.) See Richard Ellmann's revised biography, page 148.    As a character, Stephen seems to parallel many facets of Joyces life and personality. As if to further corroborate this, Stephen's first name comes from the first Christian martyr and, in a curious juxtaposition, his surname references the mythological figure Daedalus, a brilliant artificer who constructed a pair of wax wings for himself and his son Icarus as a means of escaping the island of Crete, where they were imprisoned by King Minos (who contracted Daedalus to build a Labyrinth to contain the Minotaur). Some critics suggest that Stephen's surname both symbolically likens him to Daedalus, a cunning artist and aesthetic, and goes on to reflect the labyrinthine quality of Stephen's developmental journey in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.    The choice to use the name Dedalus could also represent Stephen's wish to "fly" away from the constrants of religion, nationality, and politics which he feels hold him back artisticly.

aOy01jFEaa	I think it doesn't really seem to find a decent logical assumption with only that kind of personification such as death in living creatures. Being overviewed only with that way. Although it's a natural thing that occurs in every living that can be represented in the process of personification. The statement written about personification of people and animals regarding death is still found somewhat narrow to relate upon more of the subject matter..  Death makes only one of those several points to be viewed as an idea (which is fact). It may also relate profoundly or in abstract way of representation in people or animals.    A concept about Anthropormorphism which is known as the attribution of human aspects in animate objects, animals and unseen forces. Elaborating it as evidence from art and artifacts, suggesting that it is a long held propensity that can be dated back to the earliest times. Associated with story telling. These are considering the human capacity to project human characteristics in this sophisticated form.  Hence, some are favored and others were not. That is maybe why you could have possibly come up with the notion of viewing it in skeptical manner. Regarding death personifications of people and animals. That seemingly conveys lower value of life.     If you're relating planets and meteors in this particular subject. Human can be capable of expressing these forms coordinating it with ideas to its unique way of projection abilities by creations. Developing it, will prove great possibilities in anticipation.   Or either if referring the concept of effects of these planets and meteors emphasizing to end up living creatures' lives. Is only but part of some expectations to occur revealed in some story tellings.    I think it's only an appropriate way of an idea to express more favorable ideas in respect of living creatures quality of life and with more positive outlook for its lifespan..|`|AA11564934	maybe in a poetic sense, but as a basis for a real discussion of what life is,, "personfication of death" seems meaningless to me.|`|AA11635601	No, not personifications of death - but life does seem to be a property of matter.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	People and animals as well as celestial bodies are all personifications of life. We are here to learn, nothing more, nothing less. A lesson can be learned in a microsecond, so who are we to say that because a being only "lives" for a short time, it is somehow less significant? Death and birth are simply transitions from one plane of existence to another.|`|sa1JGWSkaa	That makes no sense.      Planets & meteors are inanimate objects.  They don't think.      Animals are not the personification of anything.  Death is a state of being, not a personification.|`|AA11736322	We humans follow the natural flow of nature... When we lock our minds in egotistical thinking we will just alter our course of actions.     When we ignore intelligent energy and just use our intellect and ego, we act as random energy... This is unbalanced and will perform acts of destruction.     It really is quite simple... Because we put a value on life, we see things that destroy as a disaster and yet this is the way our universe functions.|`|mppB9ebgaa	Time is relative. For creations such as planets and stars minutes is, to us is 1000's of years.     Are we personifications of death? I think you have to give us more credit then that. We've done some pretty amazing things in life.    The need for thought is the need to breathe. To push the mind past its choking atmosphere of "average" into a dimension in which analyzing psychological anomalies are possible.|`|1XRHUCvtaa	Thought is simply a means of survival in this world. If we couldn't think we wouldn't be such a successful species. Thinking is a tool we use to get above the fray, reproduce, and pass on our thinking genes.    If you think thinking is more important than that, it might imply that thought is 'needed' to achieve something greater, which cannot be achieved in the space of a human life, which implies that we have more than a human life to think our thoughts and find their purpose. That would mean we have a soul, we a born again or live on in another world after this one.    I think there is no soul. Thinking is what we do so our DNA can get down with other DNA and pass on the ability to survive.
36566dc5b90c2dff351c1bea496e4ad8aa	It's our nature to judge things before we know a lot about them. It's something a lot of people can't help. Don't get me wrong, we have lots of people that aren't judgemental, because they can see beyond that, and I completely applaud them for that. I try to do that. Then we just have people that take one look at someone who's different, and label them. I've been wrong about people when I based them on first impressions, and people have been wrong about me. Prejudice is impossible for many people to overcome, and it will always be an issue.|`|AA11502685	Because of low self esteem.  By making others smaller we think we make ourselves larger.

3732cd3246e1f5c16d8dc169e22b83ccaa	One possible answer deals with the pre-existence of the soul personality and its memory of different incarnations on earth.  To investigate this possibility deeper, you would naturally have to open yourself to the idea that you have a soul and that this soul's experience is not limited to your current life.  If you are a religious person or student of anthropology, you may find it interesting that all major world religions have doctrines of reincarnation.  Dja Vu would, in this case, be the surfacing of a memory from a prior experience.  A second possibility, much in contrast to the former, is that the human brain captures much more information than the conscious mind can process, and the experience of Dja Vu is just a recollection of something the brain had captured previously that you were not consciously aware of.|`|AA12327232	deja vu is the feeling that youve been through that moment of time before or one alot like it|`|0c970130ff5d2bb87a9108c00564dfabaa	Deja vu?I think is that senzation,what makes u wander if u do that thing some time ago and u didn't remember.Its very strange when is happening.For example,u r walking on the street,in a place that u know is new for u,but u have a senzation that u already walked there.o_o|`|AA12137408	deja vu (literally translated from French, "already seen") is a vivid psychic experience in which immediately contemporary events seem to be a repetition of a previous happenings.|`|4843021b668dcca4a521a18349cd1c06aa	Although no one remembers, before agreeing to incarnate, God shows us a sort of home movie of how things are probably going to go during that lifetime.  Whatever life challenge (poverty, loss of a loved one, etc.) to be experienced is shown.  We then agree or don't and wait for another possible assignment.    Because of free will, we can change the path of our life and so can anyone else.      Deja vu is exactly like the mile markers on the freeway.  If you experience Deja vu then you haven't seriously invoked your free will and you're living your life as God initially showed it to you.      If you don't experience deja vu then you have invoked your free will and are making your own path - athough the agreed upon life challenges/lessons remain the same, only manifesting in a different specific manner.|`|e395047436a29f417657d148401a4376aa	Deja vu means already seen, that weird experience when it feels like a particular situation has occurred before.A lot of dreams aren't remembered when one wakes up so when you feel deja vu it could be because something from what happened relates closely to what it was like in a dream you've had, so it feels like its happened before.

Throughout its history, it has been repeatedly saddled with a definition only to break the categorical restraints. In fact, the word itself, "novel," can tell you most of what you need to know about how to work in the genre. You can feel free to use new, "novel," techniques and forms. You may write a novel consisting entirely of letters (see Samuel Richardson, one of the first novelists); you may write novels consisting entirely of dialogue (see _Kiss of the Spider Woman_ by Manuel Puig); you may write novels from several points of view (see _As I Lay Dying_ by Faulkner); you may come up with something we've never seen before. I firmly believe the best advice for developing your own formal innovations is to read the novelists you love a lot. Don't let anyone tell you there is a wrong way to write a novel. Rules are made to be broken.|`|4cfd532d231fe273d304d485a1e8a626aa	This works for me:    I get my best ideas in the morning right after I wake up.|`|22610a9282d439206f6e49f3af5950cdaa	This website has lots of good tips:  http://www.hollylisle.com/fm/

The reason that it is what it is and not what it should be is simple. Once we have decided that it is what it is, we have given up on what we want it to be. Therefore, we have setteled for what it is. Many of us have come to the conclusion that certain things are not worth changing. We get comfortable in the situataion and accept it for what it is. Should we hang on a little longer, and make it right, then it becomes what it should be. Never lose sight of what is right.

wFBVuBOkaa	The Colorado Coalfield War from 1913-1914; this culminated in the Ludlow Massacre, but there are a lot of more interesting things about it than that.    Also in Colorado, the Cripple Creek strikes from 1903-1904.    In New York in 1909, garment workers went on strike. It was called the Uprising of the 20,000. You could link the plight of the garment workers in 1909 with the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.    The Anthracite Coal Strike in Pennsylvania in 1902 is pretty influential too.

The strike was intended to neutralize the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and hence protect Japan's advance into Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, where Japan sought access to natural resources such as oil and rubber. Both the U.S. and Japan held long-standing contingency plans for war in the Pacific which were continuously updated as tensions between the two countries steadily increased during the 1930s, with the Japanese expansion into Manchuria and French Indochina greeted by steadily increased levels of embargoes and sanctions from the United States and other nations.|`|RVAPQg6Waa	The United States had just instituted an economic blockade on Japan, cutting off supplies most notably oil and steel.

Any fool with enough power could see if we were out of the picture, in three different ways they could do much more.|`|kacLYFrHaa	The idea was to knock out the US Navy and make the US sue for peace. The reasons for Japan going to war with the US included the Export Control Act of 1940, the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, America's support of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945, the oil embargo of 1941, and even US military buildup of the Philippines during 1941.     The Export Control Act had limited what the US exported to Japan in an effort to force Japan to end it's occupation of the Ino-Chinese coastal region. It included airplanes, airplane parts, machine tools, avaiation fuel, and munitions. What was not included in the Export Control Act was oil as it was felt in 1940 that it was too extreme to deny Japan the oil it was getting from the US and could lead to war. But this was changed in 1941 with the oil embargo as new restrictions were placed on domestic oil consumption in the US. This coincides with Japan's invasion of French Indochina and may be viewed as much political retaliation as priorities for US oil having changed leaving Japan in the lurch.    Then there is the Washington Naval Treaty. Following WWI it was decided to limit the size of major world navies in terms of tonnage. At this time the Imperial Japanese Navy was becoming one of the major navies of the world and Japan expected to be treated the same as the US and UK. However, while the US and UK had the same tonnage limitations put on them, Japan was forced to have a reduced naval strength from what they had. In effect Japan had been told it could not have a navy which could challenge the US or UK.    And then there is the Second Sino-Japanese war. The US, UK, and France began providing loans to the Chinese goverment for the purchase of war material in December of 1937 in retaliation for the Rape of Naking, an attack on the USS Panay, and a Japanese soldier striking American Consul John Allison in the face during the Rape of Nanking. The following year Australia prevented a Japanese corporation from owning an iron mine in Australia and stopped all iron exports to Japan. US support of the Chinese went beyond just economics and included the creation of the American Volunteer Group (AVG), better known as the Flying Tigers, which helped the Chinese fight off Japanese forces in China.    But these are among the reasons for Japan to go to war with the US, not to attack Pearl specifically. The Japanese could have attacked any US territory. Though the US buildup in the Philippines (a US territory at the time) was reason for going to war with the US, the US had another reason for the buildup in the Philippines. Not only was the US buildup meant to discourage Japanese agression in the Far East, but it was feared that war with Japan was not far off and the Philippines were going to be the most likely target. So military forces there had to be built up to better defend against a Japanese invasion. The Philippines were not the only place the US expected would be a likely target. On December 7, 1941 USS Enterprise and Task Force 8 were returning from delivering a squadron of Marine Wildcat fighters to bolster the defenses of Gaum while USS Lexington and Task Force 12 was steaming to Midway to delive a squadron of Marine Vindicator scout bombers there. Pearl was deemed to far away for the Japanese to sail undetected.    Yet Admiral Yamamoto realized how important an attack on Pearl would be. In May, 1940 the US Navy had moved the home port of the Pacific Fleet from the west coast of continental US to Pearl (San Pedro, California had been the home port of the fleet from 1919-1940). As the home port of the Pacific Fleet most of the fleet could be expected to been on station at any time. So Yamamoto pushed for Pearl so as to knock out the Pacific Fleet and, as stated above, force the US to sue for peace. While Pearl proved a victory for Japan, the principle reasons for the attack proved a failure. All carriers in the Pacific Fleet at the time (USS Enterprise, USS Lexington, and USS Saratoga) were not at Pearl as expected and many of the ships sunk during the attack were raised, repaired, and put back into action. And the attack ended up a sneak attack. Yamamoto wanted the US to know the attack was coming and to be able to fight back. He's been quoted as claiming a samuari does not kill his enemy while he sleeps, instead he kick's him out of bed and gives him a sword so he can defend himself. He feared a sneak attack would do the exact opposite of causing the US to sue for peace, rather it would instill a desire for retribution.|`|Q02aMlHWaa	to destroy the american pacific fleet   so that america could be powerless in the pacific war  but fortunatly the american aircraft carriers were out of the harbour   so the japanese main targets were out  they also attacked because they wanted all of the american owned pacific islands for there empire|`|AA10304847	In response to the US oil embargo, Japan tried to knock out the US Pacific Fleet in one blow, thus allowing them to continue their expansion in the Far East.

kacLYFrHaa	Actually, V for Vergeltungswaffen was the name of the weapons program. The V-1 being a forerunner of today's cruise missile, the V-2 was the first ballistic missile, then you come to the V-3. While the V-1 and V-2 can be classified as rockets or missiles, the V-3 was a little more conventional. It was an extreme long range cannon which was designed to fire artillery rounds into London from the Pas-de-Calais region of France. We're talking a range of 165 kilometers, or about 102.465 miles. This would have range greater than the German's Paris Gun from WWI which shelled Paris in 1918 (from March to August) from a range of 130 kilometers or about 80.73 miles.    Vergeltungswaffen in English means retaliatory weapons, reprisal weapons, or vengeance weapons. Remember it was 1944 that the V-1 was put into service. In fact the first use of the V-1 was just seven days after D-Day. By that time Germany no longer had control of the skies and the war had shifted in the favor of the Allies. So Hitler and the Nazi High Command needed a way to extract revenge on the Allies for changing the course of the war. The answer was the V weapons. Weapons which were more about installing fear and terror in the enemy than anything else. The V-1's actual name was the Fieseler Fi 103, the V-2 was the A-4, or the fourth rocket model in the Aggregate series, and the V-3 was the Hochdruckpumpe (High Pressure Pump, which is descriptive of how it worked) and Fleissiges Lieschen (Busy Lizzie).|`|AA11304025	for the bombing of Germany|`|WoB8gKI9aa	It really was just a propaganda name and the obvious thing they were getting vengeance fgor was the the thousands of German civilians killed during British bombing people fail to under stand the Germany was completely destroyed by allied bombing what happened to London wasn't even one tenth of what the British did to Dresden|`|KfMyKUhTaa	Um, for bombing Hamburg several times, starting huge firestorms  that continued until civilians escaping in the streets were sinking in the molten asphalt?

AA10015648	You're having some issues with spelling and grammar, to the point that I can't understand what you're trying to say.    The first paragraph is not making much sense. The beach is silent (how it sounds)... then you're reveling at the scenery (how it looks)... then you're saying how it's brutal, and soothing. All these things are contradicting. Waves smacking are noisy, but you say the beach is silent.    The most interesting part about the first paragraph is that the character finds a soothing feeling from something powerful beating against something weak. That makes sense, for a boxer; nature feels RIGHT when it involves something strong against something weak.    Play on THAT idea, and not on how beautiful/riveting/quiet the beach is. The beach represents something strong against something weak, and the huge ocean is worthy of respect because of its size and power. Sand is something that children play in, the ocean is something that MEN play in.    Your ideas are good, at the core, just poorly executed in the writing. Good luck! :D
tDYsFi0xaa	The only side is the one of truth.  All you find in "Turkish archives"  is that they have nada to support  their denial of their dark past,   its just an embarrassment to  see the only evidence they have is one   eye witness account of a POW, poor thing,  most likely forced into signing it to be allowed  to live, and some documents written by the killers  of the Armenians, not even there own allies  at the time (Germans) support their claims,  but yet they still deny, even after their own historians  who support the Armenian Genocide claims  and have spoke out against this denial,  come on now, that has  to be so humiliating  for them  to keep denying, especially knowing  almost all of the world   recognizes this as a  historical  fact, and of course knowing the most relevant and  influential fact about their own government whom  enacted laws making it  illegal to discuss, debate,   challenge, or prove the Turkish claims are   wrong, and with the knowledge of all  this, anyone could easily conclude  that this government surely wants to hide  the truth, an anything they say on this matter can't  really be trusted either.  Especially  the lies about Armenia  archives being closed, or commissions  being formed, all lies, and none of which  Turks have any proof to back up these  claims anyway.  The truth is,  Armenia has exhausted   all efforts to try an settle this once an  for all with Turkey, but only   having all their attempts   being met with resistence, threats,  and violence, is very discouraging.  Hrant Dink's murder will always   remind us of how awfully  horrid Turkey can be really be.

This is about something that happened long before we were born and as you say, there are different accounts about it depending on who is telling the story.      What to do in a case like this?  I think you have to find the most reliable and responsible sources of general information that are not likely to be biased, and see what they have to say about it.  And look at more than one source.    Wikipedia is good for many things, because it is an open information source in wide use, which has a reputation to uphold.  The information there is seen by many people so it must sort through different reactions and be able to defend its content in a logical way.  Look for these kinds of characteristics in the information sources.    Do a google on turks armenian genocide and look at what comes up.

If armenians says that their historical datas are more trustable, they should open their archievs like turkey did and discuss the issue by establishing a historical commision. Turkey offered armenia to do that but armenians rejected eventhough turkey said that they will recognize genocide if commision decides so.

AA11252231	The British East India Company was chartered in 1601 by Queen Elizabeth.  Although originally set p to compete with the Dutch in the spice trade in what is now Indonesia, the British were kicked out of the spice line by the massacre at Ambon in 1629, and thereafter focused on India. After the Battle of Plassey in 1756, the company became a major power broker in Indian politics and gained control over more and more area. In 1837 the company's monopoly on the China trade was abolished removing their largest profit sector.  They became an agent of the British Government in the governing of India and received tax monies for this purpose.  However in 1856 the "Sepoy Rebellion" (or first Indian War of Independence ) broke out, and in the aftermath the company was removed from the Indian Government.  It was officially dissolved in 1876.

The crisis started on October 16, 1962, when U.S. reconnaissance was shown to U.S. President John F. Kennedy revealing Soviet nuclear missile installations on the island, and ended thirteen days later on October 28, 1962, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev announced that the installations would be dismantled. The Cuban Missile Crisis is regarded as the moment when the Cold War came closest to escalating into a nuclear war.

They hang out with eachother, go out drinking, and meet women. Plus family members are allowed to go with the military member to Military bases and live with them when they get stationed in Japan..spain..as long as it isn't a hostil environment, families are allowed to stay with the military member. They have military housing n shopping centers n all that. So, those who arent stationed in combat areas, or hostile areas, they're ok, the familes are with them, and they aren't lonely as u think    those in Iraq or Afghanistan, or the Philippines or Africa, those guys are writing all the time to family members, they also have the internet so they basically talk with family members everyday.     If you are young, or in ur teens..or younger, maybe its better to have penpals with a person your age who is with their family over seas.

It might be more interesting to talk with somebody ur age, and u can ask them questions on how their life is. Because, they move every 3yrs of their lives. they just dont move down the street or across the state, they move from country to country.

16daa18d7325514085e1f06a96485b98aa	Primeiro, seria bom reavaliar a maneira como encara a si mesmo. Est constantemente se rebaixando, dizendo a si mesmo que outros n?o v?o gostar de voc ou que n?o tem nada de valor a dizer? Esses sentimentos negativos sobre si mesmo v?o impedi-lo de ser extrovertido. Afinal, Jesus disse: Tens de amar o teu prximo como a ti mesmo, n?o em vez de a ti mesmo. (Mateus 19:19) Assim,  bom e apropriado amar a si mesmo at certo ponto. Isso pode dar-lhe a confian?a de que talvez precise para se achegar a outros.    Se voc tem pouco amor-prprio, talvez ajude ler o captulo 12 do livro Os Jovens Perguntam  Respostas Prticas, intitulado Por que ser que n?o gosto de mim mesmo?. Isso poder ajud-lo a ver que voc tem muitas qualidades boas. Ora, o mero fato de ser crist?o demonstra que Deus v algo de valor em voc. Afinal, Jesus disse: Ningum pode vir a mim, a menos que o Pai, que me enviou, o atraia.  Jo?o 6:44.    Interesse-se pelos outros    Provrbios 18:1 avisa: Quem se isola procurar o seu prprio desejo egosta. Se voc se isolar, provavelmente dar aten??o demais a si mesmo. Filipenses 2:4 nos incentiva a n?o visar, em interesse pessoal, apenas os nossos prprios assuntos, mas tambm, em interesse pessoal, os dos outros. Quando a pessoa focaliza a aten??o nos interesses e nas necessidades de outros, passa a se preocupar menos consigo mesma. E quanto mais se importar com outros, mais provvel  que voc se sinta motivado a tomar a iniciativa de conhec-los.    Veja o exemplo de Ldia, que ficou conhecida como smbolo de cordialidade e hospitalidade. A Bblia nos diz que, depois de ouvir as palavras do apstolo Paulo e ser batizada, ela implorou a ele e a seus companheiros: Se vs me julgastes fiel a Jeov, entrai na minha casa. (Atos 16:11-15) Embora fosse recm-convertida, Ldia tomou a iniciativa de conhecer esses irm?os e, sem dvida, recebeu muitas bn??os por isso. Depois que Paulo e Silas foram soltos da pris?o, para onde foram? Voltaram  casa de Ldia.  Atos 16:35-40.    De modo similar, notar que muitas pessoas apreciar?o o interesse que voc demonstrar por elas. Como fazer isso? Veja a seguir algumas sugest?es teis:     V devagar. Ser extrovertido n?o significa que, de repente, voc vai ter de sair conversando animadamente com todo mundo ou estar presente a cada evento social. Esforce-se para conversar com uma pessoa de cada vez. Pode estabelecer o alvo de iniciar uma conversa com pelo menos uma pessoa cada vez que assistir a uma reuni?o crist?. Sorria. Olhe a pessoa nos olhos.     Quebre o gelo. Mas talvez voc pergunte: Como? Ora, se voc realmente se interessar pelos outros, em geral n?o ser difcil arranjar assunto. Jorge, um jovem espanhol, diz: Percebo que simplesmente perguntar a outros como est?o, ou indagar sobre o seu trabalho, ajuda a conhec-los melhor. Um rapaz chamado Fbio sugere: Se n?o sabe o que dizer, simplesmente comece a fazer perguntas. Claro que n?o vai querer dar s pessoas a impress?o de estarem sendo interrogadas. Se a pessoa parece relutar em responder as perguntas, tente contar algo sobre si mesmo.    M?nica, m?e de um adolescente, diz: Descobri que a melhor maneira de deixar as pessoas  vontade  incentiv-las a falar sobre si mesmas. A jovem Catarina acrescenta: Algo que ajuda  elogiar as pessoas pela sua roupa ou outra coisa. Isso as faz sentir-se queridas.  claro que voc precisa ser sincero e evitar a lisonja. (1 Tessalonicenses 2:5) Em geral, as pessoas reagem bem a express?es sinceras, bondosas e agradveis.  Provrbios 16:24.     Seja um bom ouvinte. Seja rpido no ouvir, vagaroso no falar, diz a Bblia. (Tiago 1:19) Afinal, uma conversa  um intercambio, n?o um monlogo. Assim, se voc tem a tendncia de ser tmido ao falar, isso pode realmente ser uma vantagem. As pessoas gostam de quem sabe escutar.     Participe. Depois de dominar a arte da conversa individual, passe a conversar em grupos. As reuni?es crist?s tambm s?o o lugar ideal para adquirir mais essa habilidade. s vezes o modo mais fcil de se envolver numa conversa  se juntar a um grupo que j est conversando. Naturalmente,  preciso usar de discernimento e de boas maneiras. N?o interrompa de forma brusca uma conversa particular. Mas se tiver certeza de que um grupo est conversando sobre assuntos gerais, procure participar. Use de tato; n?o interrompa nem tente controlar a conversa. Escute um pouco. Quando se sentir  vontade, talvez queira fazer alguns comentrios.     N?o espere perfei??o de si mesmo. s vezes os jovens se preocupam demais em n?o dizer nada errado. Elisa, uma jovem italiana, lembra: Sempre tive medo de falar bobagem. Mas a Bblia nos lembra de que todos somos imperfeitos, de modo que  impossvel para os humanos falar com perfei??o. (Romanos 3:23; note Tiago 3:2.) Elisa diz: Percebi que estes s?o meus amigos. V?o entender se eu disser algo errado.     Mantenha o senso de humor.  verdade que  embara?oso meter os ps pelas m?os. Mas como diz Fbio, se voc relaxa e ri de si mesmo, tudo passa rpido. Se a pessoa fica incomodada, frustrada ou preocupada, estar fazendo tempestade num copo dgua.     Seja paciente. Lembre-se de que nem todos v?o reagir bem logo de imediato. Uma desconfortvel parada na conversa n?o significa necessariamente que a pessoa n?o gosta de voc ou que  melhor desistir de tentar conversar. s vezes, a pessoa s est preocupada ou  tmida, como voc. Nessas situa??es, talvez ajude dar um pouco mais de tempo  pessoa para que se sinta  vontade com voc.     Esforce-se para conversar com adultos. Muitos adultos, em especial crist?os maduros, s?o bastante compreensivos com jovens que lutam contra a timidez.

This song became the most popular belief with former band mates saying that Hartley said he would either play "Nearer, My God, to Thee" or "O God, Our Help in Ages Past" if he was ever on a sinking ship, but Walter Lord's book A Night to Remember popularized wireless officer Harold Bride account of hearing the song "Autumn". It is believed Bride meant the hymn called "Autumn" or "Songe d'Automne," a popular song at the time.    His body was recovered by the MackayBennet as body number 224. 1,000 people attended his funeral, while 40,000 lined the route of his funeral procession. He is buried in Colne where a 10foot bust was erected in his honour. A blue plaque marks the house in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire where he lived at the time of his death."

They were certainly brave men because they played to the last, hoping to keep the passengers and crew as calm as possible.

AA12358300	not always|`|074cf24574f09e8812a4a212c35f0c43aa	There really is a thin line between love and hate. You can love someone for a moment and then hate them for a lifetime. It is all about growth and experience through trials and tribulations. Life is like the Tarot card, the Wheel of Fortune : What goes up must come down - we all know and understand   this, yet when we are down, feeling low or unhappy, it can   be so hard to believe life will ever get better!    Sometimes we experience good luck and good fortune   unexpectedly, and when we do, oh how joyful and exciting it   is!  Getting a phone call out of the blue from the person   youve fancied for ages asking you out on a date, winning   some money, getting an unexpected promotion and pay rise at   work, friends and family throwing you a surprise party    all these experiences or surprises make us feel on top of   the world.    Conversely, when you hear through a friend that your lover   is seeing someone else, your bank surprisingly turns down   your request for a loan, your boss unexpectedly announces   youre going to be laid off or you lose a loved one  these   experiences and shocks can leave us emotionally devastated,   feeling as though the world is somehow against us.    The Wheel of Fortune represents such unexpected turns of   fate and fortune. Sometimes the wheel will turn in your   favor and bring unexpected good luck and fortune, sometimes   it will turn against you and you will experience bad luck   and misfortune. However, the wheel suggests that these   turns of fortune are beyond your control, they are part of   the eternal movement and cycle of life.    When the Wheel of Fortune appears in your readings you can   expect an unexpected change in your fortune  so if you   have been experiencing a run of bad luck or misfortune and   the Wheel of Fortune lays in your near future, then the   cards are suggesting that it wont be long before fate will   come into play and your luck will start to change.   Conversely, in the situation where the Wheel of Fortune is   ahead and things have been going great for you up to now,   read it as a warning that something unexpected may throw a   spanner in the works and bring a challenging time.    The appearance of this card in answer to a question about   what you should do about something or someone, can suggest   that, whatever you do, fate will determine the outcome.   However, if surrounding cards are negative, it could be a   warning that making the wrong choice could backfire on you.    Life has its ups and downs, and understanding and accepting   this helps us to hold a more realistic view of life itself.   Remember that the wheel turns up, just as surely as it   turns down ... its just the eternal and constant rhythm and   cycle of life.|`|7a4a266183706c244b6bb59630b1c67eaa	not really|`|7aea94e658d307bdd53ef8b3774b0d25aa	could be..its a thin line between lovin n hatin somebody..|`|b4bf657bc38a788c0c5012fe5dfab603aa	Sometimes; usually they're just upset because their relationship failed and they blame the other.|`|2bf8a9f69ef98e151a5e30ae0dfc3bf0aa	They hate the pain because the love was not the real thing. many of us think we are the gift of love in our very lives we offer to another, but when that love is tested and breaks we are hurt.Unless we go to the source itself we can not attain or give the real thing.|`|AA11050371	Sometimes it could be true, I certainly hope not often. I'm in a relationship with this guy right now, and we've been talking for weeks!!! Then, he just doesn't call, it's been four days now and I haven't heard from him.  >> It depends on who it is, and what the situation is. I find myself wanting to hate this guy, because I LOVE him!!! I just don't want to be hurt, ya know? So I tell myself to hate him, and maybe it'll all be okay somehow. So it really depends on the situation. Deep down, i don't hate him, i LOVE him!! I don't really , hate HIM, i hate what he's DOING. Hope that helps!!!!

97d745f64210357e470a1cc998c46bc5aa	You take birth, when God has a desire to experience the world through you.     You come here to experience all sides of life, the good, the bad and the evil. So that when you have experienced all and judge no one, you are free from all judgments. That is when you become free while you are alive in this body that is when you are ready to step outside the realm of emotion and experience and enter into the realm of bliss. That is what Godhood is about. When you live life as God would.    Once you have experienced all that is there to experience according to your life script you get to walk out, if you are alive that means it still is work in progress.     But there comes a point in life when you let go of all your expectations from life and experience it fully just the way it comes to you, knowing that it is just an experience God is having through you, you are free of the realm of the experience because you know that you are not what you experience, you are what you are. That is why knowing who you are. is the first step towards freedom from the realm of emotions. When you know that it is all just a veil stretched over your eyes to help you learn about who you are, then the Matrix or Maya breaks for you, then you are no longer attached or have any aversion towards any thing, or any experience in life, you are free.    When you no longer want to step out, when you feel free within already, you are ready to step out, and you get to step out as well.    Moksha or Nirvana simply is living freely as your self and celebrating who we are in spirit, every moment.      But if you still feel trapped in your life look out what is it that you havent accepted from your life experience, because once you do you are free. Self acceptance is freedom in life. To be yourself and celebrate who you are within.     So if you are prepared to die tomorrow you are prepared to live. To take chances on life, because you know it is only life, you will loose all of it any way, why cry so much for it already? Why not celebrate this gift called life.|`|7cbd602201a92b18788eb5f29378dc7faa	Without birth, this place wouldn't be this place.|`|AA10761397	'cause we have to fulfill our karmas and to get rid of its cycle you will have to find a way to fulfill your karmas|`|69b00513d26357260cbf932d0d55e162aa	um, could you rephrase that?|`|AA11092164	we cannot get rid of it. that is how we are made of|`|AA10346182	Taking birth is a cycle in some religious beleives.

7647af289f81167f6ff61c980cbc4abeaa	In the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, we hear the prophecy that Voldemort had sent his Death Eaters to get from the Department of Mysteries.  Sybil Trelawney, in a rare bout of actual divination, goes into a trance and tells Dumbledore of a child who will be born to defeat Voldemort.  The full prophecy is as follows:  `The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies . and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not . and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives . the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies .'  Neville was also born as the month of July ends, so Voldemort sent Bellatrix and a few others to the Longbottoms', who were Aurors at the time and pure bloods to boot.  They tortured them into insanity while Voldemort took the Potters on his own.  In going to the Potters' himself, Voldemort unknowingly chose the one who must kill him.  Interesting, he chose the child who was born to a Muggle born and not the pure blood child.|`|AA10862251	Neville's parents were tortured b/c they were against voldemrt. Voldemort didnt go after Harry's parents, he went after Harry, and his parents got in way,but he probably would have went after them anyway b/c they were fighting against Voldemort, but he went after Harry b/c a prophecy made by Trelawny said that a boy born in July whose parents defied voldmort 3 times is the only one who can defeat Voldemort, so Voldemort went after Harry to destroy him before he became more powerful than himself, but obviosely, that backfired on him, and destroyed him and made Harry stronger.

Lord Voldemort himself went after Lily and James Potter because he was told by Severus Snape that their child, Harry Potter, was the only one who could defeat him (even though he was supposed to be immortal), as heard in a Propecy made by Trewlaney. Lord Voldemort had to kill James (first) and Lily (who had fled to Harry's criddle) to murder their baby boy... and failed. Lord Voldemort, for some unknown reason, didn't mean to kill Lily, but she wouldn't allow him to kill his son.|`|d5613dadb2b45d21862cb122ae359983aa	professor trewlany made a prophecy about harry's parents and neville's parents were tortured by a death eater because she thought they had info about voldemort|`|9b5bce4d5eaf55134f96283b78d270daaa	because remembr voldemort was trying to get rid of all the ppl who r tryin to get rid of him. i 4got wht they were called.. i knw that voldemorts ppl were the deatheaters..but i forgot about dumbledores ppl.. lol but yea he was just tryin to get them to talk and get rid of them and i guess voldemort just thought he'd kill the potters himself but failed in killing Harry and ever since then hes been obsessed with killing him because he failed the first time.|`|1bcc0a57e83d93747625c74ecb78740aaa	Voldemort is a power hungry megalomaniac and they were people who were going to expose him.

Neville was just a baby at the time, and was sent to live with his grandmother. Because of their mental illnesses, Neville's parents can no longer recognize him. However, he visits them during the holidays at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. We don't know exactly why Bellatrix Lestrange was sent out to torture the Longbottoms, but J.K. Rowling has said that she was not specifically sent to destroy Neville.    When Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow on Halloween night, he went with the intentions of killing Harry, not his parents. Voldemort had heard part of a Prophecy which fortold of a child born at the end of July, and that this child would have the power to detroy him. When Voldemort reached the Potters' house, Harry's father, James, started a duel him in attempt to protect his family. Voldemort ended up murdering him before advancing on Harry, who was hiding with his mother, Lily. Voldemort told her to step aside so he could kill her son, but she wouldn't move. In doing so, she sacrificed herself, and left a magical protection on Harry: love. When Voldemort then tried to kill Harry, the spell backfired, which left him barely alive. He fled the scene before anyone knew what had happened to him, which led many to believe that he had died. Harry was taken to live with his Muggle relatives.    Goodness, I hope that made sense.

db84e3afd6a36514faf38e944d953ae6aa	Filosoficamente s?o dois em evolu?ao:  O  fsico   = 0,3   +  a mente=0,7 = fsico e mente 1  O esprito = 0  Fsico e mente = 1   + esprito= 0  =  fsico,mente e esprito =10  Ent?o o numero um(1) representa= fsico e mente  E o numero zero(0) representa= esprito  Esses dois nmeros representam a tridimensionalidade de como o Universo evolui atravs dos nmeros, os dois veculos que possuem uma luminosidade diferente e menor que a do esprito, por isso o zero esta presente e mostrando o caminho certo de evolu??o que o um (1) deva seguir, n?o importando a dire??o e sim a evolu??o desta luz.  Se voc perceber os nmeros arbicos na verdade n?o eram contados ou interpretados pela sua forma e sim pelo numero de angulos existentes nos desenhos representando nmeros, hoje na atualidade os nmeros s?o interpretados pelas suas formas. Espero que eu tenha esclarecido e n?o complicado, porque na verdade eu coloquei 0,3 ou 0,7 para perceber que o esprito esta sempre presente na manifesta??o dos nmeros ou sabedorias, e se eu coloca-se simplesmente 3 e 7 e 0 que  o correto voc acabaria somando errado e ai ficaria errado assim 3+7=10 e ai n?o se compreenderia ha onde colocar o esprito zero(0). Outro exemplo um numero s, n?o pode ser o mais simples e nem o mais complexo, porque se ha uma tridimensionalidade um argumento por si s n?o se justifica a n?o ser que esse argumento por si s justifique uma tridimensionalidade, outro exemplo no caso de uma palavra ai sim qualquer palavra existente no Universo justifica uma tridimensionalidade, por exemplo, informa??o  formada por trs perodos ou estgios que s?o 1o dados, 2o modo ou forma e 3o instrumento, e se alguma palavra for desconhecido o nome de seu perodo, n?o quer dizer que n?o ha uma energia ali se expressando em nome do perodo. Outra raz?o bem forte  que os nmeros na verdade s?o argumentos de evolu??o mental, isso quer dizer s?o raz?es de uma s dimens?o e qualquer argumento para ser unificado como uma palavra tem que ser unificado em trs dimens?es. Se voc perceber todos os grandes feitos existentes em qualquer categoria no universo foi justificado por um terico (esprito), um matemtico (mental) e um experimentalista (fsico).  parecia fcil a sua pergunta, mas n?o , parabns por ela e por ter uma profundidade espantosa me proporcionou um imenso prazer em responder pena que eu n?o possa me aprofundar mais, ficaria muito extenso.

Com o passar do tempo, entretanto, e com a releitura de alguns outros livros e a leitura de alguns que n?o havia lido, a dvida veio para ficar. Hoje, me divido entre trs de seus romances:     A Paix?o Segundo GH, por me revelar cada passo do caminho naquele 'deserto escaldante', toda a travessia, que, segundo Clarice, somos ns mesmos;    gua-Viva, por ser um verdadeiro poema em prosa, uma sinfonia em palavras, o livro em que ela capta o 'instante-j', do incio ao fim e onde mergulhamos desde a primeira pgina, sem aviso, sem que ela nos guie, como no livro anterior; e    Um Sopro de Vida (Pulsa??es), por ser seu testamento literrio, livro inacabado e organizado para publica??o por Olga Borelli, onde a narra??o se divide entre autor e personagem, em um dilogo absolutamente rico.    N?o sei escolher entre estes livros, ou, ainda, a cada momento escolho um como favorito, dependendo do momento e da releitura que fa?o deles. Que bom que ela os escreveu.

35fdfcc942da772e22a482dd20b5e9b9aa	Define patriotism.  I know a great many kids (I teach high school science) who go on to join the military.  Patriotism is an oft-abused term.  If it means do they vow allegiance to the ruling class, then I would have to say that they are not patriotic, and neither am I.  If it means that they love the country, that is kind of an abstract concept, because most of them have never visited more than a few states.  If they love their freedoms...I think that they, just like the generations before, take their freedoms for granted, but I think that is even becoming less the truth now that our freedoms are beginning to disappear in the ostensible search for terrorists.  It's a very hard question to answer because "patriotism" is a word that can be used (or twisted) to mean many different things.|`|eb59fc522d20921feacc066d38f90961aa	The feeling of patriotism comeing from home, that try to make the love of country and willingness grow inside the children to sacrifice for it...And i think that the children now know what goes on the other countries and they but themselves on this situation...

Patriotism, Nationalism and racism are  very, very short distances apart. The Nazi's in Germany were very national, very patriotic and very, very racist.

I love my country I really do but I can't say I like our current President and our congress is so corrupt they are trying to prevent congress men who are criminals from being prosecuted for criminals acts. Our freedoms are being whittled away under the guise of greater security and fear. We are isolating ourselves more and more from the rest of the world with our political policies. The government has completely disenfranchised the public with electoral process. Not to mention we started a war and removed a dictator with no proof effectively ruining a world reputation it took two hundred years to build and setting off a chain reaction that unstabilized one of the most volatile regions in the world.    I could go on but that would take all day, so what do I have to be patriotic about?

AA11252231	Perhaps you are looking for Herostratus (Erostrato in Spanish; Herostrat in German.)  He was a young man in the ancient city of Ephesus who conceived of the idea of destroying the most beautiful thing in the world in order to achieve lasting fame.  Accordingly, he set fire to the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, and then proudly confessing his crime. (Coincidentally, 21st July 356 BC, the date of the crime was also the birthday of Alexander the Great!)   His name has shown up in a number of ways:  1) The Herostrato Syndrome is the title of a book studying modern (9/11) terrorism for self-glorification  2) Erostrato is the name of an essay by Sartre and a film based on the essay. There is currently a Broadway play based on the Sartre writings.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herostratus|`|9f61a68d8013c5a709711b666f7a06c4aa	it is not "who", it is "what".  aerostato is called the "hot air balloon."  put it in your search engine and get whatever you need.
