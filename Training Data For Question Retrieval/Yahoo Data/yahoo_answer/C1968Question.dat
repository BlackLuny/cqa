Before everything went digital I got ABC, NBC, CBS, AND FOX. Now I can only get CBS AND FOX. Now I think the only channel that has not went digital it channel 40, which is NBC.       If I go to Task, Settings, Digital TV Antenna Signal Strength. These are the channels I get with 4 bars (orange). 1061(CBS), 1401(NBC), 1491(FOX), 1101(ALSO NBC), AND 1111(DON'T KNOW WHAT CHANNEL THAT IS).      But I get CBS AND FOX. Now a few days ago I could not get a good signal of NBC. Now I get four bars, but when I go to the channel I get this, "no tv signal" Why do I get no tv signal if settings shows that I have a good signal. I hate this computer, next week I am getting DTV I just hope I don't have too much trouble with getting Satellite on this darn thing.       Please I hope someone can help me tonight.      Thanks so much.

For the last three days, someone has been calling my house and as soon as I pick up and say "Hello", they hang up. I look at the caller id when the phone is ringing and all it says is incoming call, but when other people call my house, it says their name and number. I also looked at the caller id after I hang up and it doesn't say anything about the person calling! This afternoon, they called again and I said "Get the damn number right next time" (thinking they were intentionally calling the wrong number). He/she called again about an hour ago and they said something this time but I couldn't make it out. This happens about four times everyday. What should I do?

I'm in the market for a 32" LCD HDTV and am on a fairly tight budget (trying not to spend over ~$600 for it).      I'm planning to mostly use it for watching standard definition television and hooking it up to my laptop to watch videos online or downloaded movies...my laptop also plays Blu-Ray, so I might watch them occasionally, but probably not often enough to be a factor.      Anyways, my question is whether I should buy a higher quality 720p HDTV (I'm thinking the Sony or Samsung), or go for a 1080p Vizio. I want videos played from my computer to look really good on the TV, but I don't know if 1080p will make a huge difference on a 32".       Any insight?

Looking first at their professional looking website,  http://www.wiidollars.com/,  I paid Wii Dollars Magazine $4 in exchange for what was supposed to be 2000 Wii Shop points. I never got them in a little over six weeks and have gotten nothing short of continuing empty promises, so far.       Surprisingly, their customer service has answered my e-mail recently as well as they have claimed to be planning to soon use priority shipping. Has anyone actually gotten these discount Wii Shop points? I don't normally fall for scams, but I felt as though this looked legitimate.       Finally, I don't even know for sure yet that this definitely is a scam. Could you please offer your opinion? (Try to look at the website first to be able to have a good amount of information to formulate your opinion) If you've actually paid for and gotten or not gotten these discount Wii Shop points, your input would especially be helpful. Otherwise, any educated opinion would be helpful, regardless.

I have a classic iPod (120G - black thick one) and I had just recently bought a new iPod Touch (the newest generation - 16G). I just restored my computer and recovered it to its original state (meaning clear EVERYTHING out of the computer because of viriuses and lag). Before I did this (when my computer had viruses and lag) I used iTunes with my classic 120G and it worked fine. After clearing out my computer i downloaded iTunes off the apple site and then plugged my iTouch into it. I put a few songs on my iTouch. Today, i tried to connect my old classic 120G and all it does is freeze up the iTunes until i disconnect it. Can anyone tell me why it freezes up itunes and why it can't read my 120G?? And how can i get it so that I can put music on both my 120G and my new 16G iTouch????      Thanks

I'm still a beginner when it comes to digital photography, but when reviewing lenses offered by Zuiko, it seems to me that they are much more expensive that many competitors in the market.       Example:   Zuiko 25mm f/2.8 pancake lens retails for $269   Pentax 50MM f/1.4 retails for 199$      Considering the fact that the pentax offers wider aperture, why would the zuiko lens be more expensive?

20070222102012AAo4ftu	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Would the cell phone work here?	Lets face it, Japanese cell phones kick some serious tail, compared to 99% of phones in North America.       Say, for instance, that I were to buy a cell phone in Japan, and then brought it here. I realize that some of the fancy things that they can do with their cell phones over there (paying for food with a built-in mini credit card at 7-11) wouldn't work here. Would the phone work though? If I were to surf the net on it, would it be compatible, or would it glitch up? I was thinking of importing one from my friend there, but before I do, I wanna make sure it will work, and not be a fancy paper weight.      I've heard that there wouldn't be any issues, but I have my doubts.      I live in Saskatchewan, Canada btw.

I just got a new LG 8550 Chocolate phone and am attempting to insert the 2.0 Gb memory card into the slot on the upper right behind the labeled cover, but for some reason it doesn't appear to fit in smoothly.  Putting it in with the words on the top into the phone doesn't ever smoothly connect and when it slightly seems to the phone won't recognize it in settings-memory.  When I turn it over so the metal memory strips are towards me, it seems to slide smoothly in but seems incorrect.  I put it in quite a ways and it seemed to get stuck all the way in the phone and the phone still didn't acknowledge it.  I feel highly inept, so if you could tell me if I'm being retarded I would appreciate it.

20081024080812AAh4HHt	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Hard drive in PS3 to quite fan?	Hi,   My 80GB PS3 is pretty loud, because of the fan.  Starts out without a noise, after ten minutes I can hear the fan.  Still not as bad as my old 360 but still not perfect.      I am aware that one can easily swap hard drives in the PS3 for any other standard 2. SATA laptop hard drive.      Just wondering if one would actually experience less hard drive heat, and therefore less fan noise, witching from the original Hard Drive which spins at 5400rpms to another model which spins at the same speed.  Going to a solid state drive would be nice but just not worth the $amt yet.      Is the majority of the PS3 heat coming from the hard drive?  Therefore will switching to a more efficient, less power consuming drive make the PS3 play cooler and therefore the fans to be quieter?
