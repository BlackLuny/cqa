vgxEN4MGaa	Sorry man but 3G broadband is not compatable with PS3. <br>  <br>  Its OK for a computer because the 3G USB dongle is recognised and just connects to the nearest 3G point but PS3 wont recognise it and be like ''WTF get this dongle outta me''.<br>  <br>  To play online gaming as its intended you need to:<br>  <br>  * Subscribe to a broadband service like Sky broadband or Virgin. Anything above 2MB is fine, but if you can getting 10MB will help your games alot. If you plan to do other high load stuff Virgin offer its new 50MB service in the UK now (its insane i know).<br>  <br>  * Get a modem (they normally provide it for you when they install it). This brings the internet into your house from outside.<br>  <br>  * Get a wireless router, this will allow your PS3 to connect using its built in wifi and also allow other devices like your PCs or laptops to connect using the routers 4 spare ethernet ports.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	No, it's not compatible. <br>  <br>  This type of broadband is totally unsuitable for online gaming in any case, due to the very low data caps (like 1GB-4GB a month) and the huge amount of lag in the connection.<br>  <br>  Mobile broadband is more just for people who want to check their email and look at a few websites on the move without having to seek out a wi-fi hotspot first. It's in no way a substitute for a normal broadband connection.|`|MWE7rQ4Daa	Highly doubt it. And also if you were going to play an online game with it you would use up a gig in about 5 minutes, not worth it.|`|fJ7OeopSaa	no its not,you will need broadband going through a phone line
RyvKws7Laa	This depends entirely on the specific model numbers you're looking at.  Sony Bravia has its base and flagship lines and Samsung has is base, mid-range, and flagship lines.  So to just outright compare the brands is pretty tough call to make frankly.  You need to break it down in a model by model comparison.<br>  <br>  Up until 2008 Sony was buying is LCD panels from Samsung.  Samsung changed its business methods though and it didn't really suit Sony to continue buying their panels.  So now Sony buys its panels from Sharp (the ones used in the Sharp Aquos line).  They use their own image processor though.<br>  <br>  Samsung LCDs, especially their flag ship lines, tend to outperform the Sony's top models.  Its not by a wide margin though.  If you went with a top notch model from either company, you're likely in very respectable shape with the TV you've chosen.<br>  <br>  And it depends what year you make the purchase too.  Some years Sony will release a new technology that gives them a slight picture quality edge.  Other years Samsung will be the one with the new flashy technology giving its lineup a slight edge.  Its 6 of one, a half dozen of the other.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	They're both good TVs, but I have yet to come across a Sony that I think is priced fairly.  Good value wins my loyalty.  That's why I just bought a Samsung plasma to replace my Samsung LCD.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	Yes Sony is better than Samsung but only by a little.  Samsung is more economical.|`|CvoyIESkaa	Most people would probably say the Sony is better.|`|gorHSgUAaa	In the same price I think that samsung better.|`|A4Zug447aa	I prefer Sony it looks better and they seem to last longer my friends dad own a TV repair business and he says sonys last longer and they are built a lot better. Sony is a Japanese company that was started all about good high quality i would get the sony it will outlast the samsung. Toshiba is also a great brand of tv ive had the same 50in for 10 years and my grandma had it before that not HD but it still works never had a problem still use it today|`|dqzoEw67aa	Actually, Samsung is the #1 rated LCD tv.  Sony is a close second, but Sammy is #1 now.  As stated above, as both are good, you'd have to compare the actual model of each brand that you are interested in, to get a good comparison.  They both have entry level up to super high line sets.

qR4xcTfaaa	There is not much of a difference between these cameras, therefore I recommend for you to buy the new camera so you will have full warranty.<br>  But, you should seriously look in to buying a new D80, it is much more solid than both D60 & D40 and the price just dropped by 33%.<br>  But, always, buy NEW. These cameras are to sophisticated to buy used or refurb.|`|sR3gcvubaa	I would not buy refurbished again regardless of the brand and model.  I did once and was NOT satisfied.  It was supposedly factory refurbished but it didn't work like new.  I have the D40 and it's okay for me.  Seems like a fairly stripped down DSLR but it works for me, the novice camera user who doens't use it too often. The pictures are nice and clear.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	yes they are<br>  all of the problems are already fixed<br>  make sure it is factory refurbished|`|eIlQN7XFaa	The refurbished Nikon D-60 would be the way to go. It is slightly faster has a sensor cleaner activated on start up/shutdown, more in camera editing options and a new movie mode where it lets you take up to 100 shots and make a movie in camera.** see the first link** The D-60 comes with a vr(vibration reduction) 18-55 Lens that helps with camera shake. A new feature on the D-60 is something called  active d lighting( it relives heavily shaded areas like dark back rounds). The D-60 is the upgrade to the D-40x. The D-40x was the upgrade to the D-40. Slowly the product has gotten better and cheaper while adding some relay nice features. Stick with the D-60. Here is a link to watch a Video tour of both cameras the D-60 is the second link. The D-40x is the third link.|`|gorHSgUAaa	I suggest that you buy new Nikon D60.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Don't know what is wrong with your camera, but bad electrical contacts/batteries make cameras do strange things like making bad pictures or shutting off with the lens out.<br>  <br>  A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the next link.  Those batteries are still going strong after four months of normal use and have not been recharged.<br>   <br>  Most NiMH rechargeable batteries lose charge and should be recharged when not used after two weeks, but Duracell new formula 2000mAh NiMH batteries hold charge one year when not used.  Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries (about one year old) still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.<br>   <br>  Click this link for complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a><br>   <br>  Camera reports batteries low, but is it low charge or bad electrical contacts? Overcharging can ruin good batteries!  The secret to making digital cameras work better is having good electrical contacts between batteries and camera. <br>   <br>  Digital cameras require lots of power. Bad electrical contacts can cause lots of problems so battery and camera contacts must be cleaned properly.  Batteries may be fully charged, but camera will indicate "low" if contacts are not really good. The LCD screen is a low steady load, but when lens extension, optical zoom, focus, and flash charging are added in the capture mode; the load is very heavy.  Bad contacts make cameras do strange things like making bad pictures or shutting off with the lens out.<br>  <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge. To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  Never touch battery ends or camera electrical contacts.  Oil from fingers will contaminate contacts.  Use batteries in matched pairs of same brand and rating.  Do not mix old and new batteries.  New will only do as well as old. <br>   <br>  NiMH batteries should be recharged when camera reports batteries low.  Old batteries can discharge over night, but may provide normal service immediately after being charged.  Battery pairs no longer usable in cameras may work well in flashlights.  Do not drop batteries or allow voltage below one volt. <br>   <br>  Digital cameras reset to original settings if batteries are removed for one minute. Time varies with function/camera. Check display/setup menu for non-auto functions and date/time. Remove extra memory to eliminate this as a possible problem.  Insert fully charged/cleaned batteries and restart camera. The ultimate non-physical repair for software-using devices is reset by removing power ...

s0PKOSijaa	I'm not sure, but my best guess is is should work. You can put on things like the balaclava on your head wearing the Ghillie suit, so the head gear might work. The only way is to try. Personally, I wouldn't though, because its a fixed color, and the silver color may give you away if your hiding. Use a dark balaclava, it'll concela you better.

AA12116276	It doesn't sound like the problem is with the iPod, especially if you restored--it's probably the songs. If the songs that sound scratched on the iPod were ones you ripped from CDs, this seems to be an issue when these songs are put on iPods sometimes. You might either need to get the songs from another source, or try to re-rip them from CDs (clean the CDs off before you re-rip; seems like the iPod might be having trouble reading the files and it could be because the CDs had scratches, were dirty, etc. iPods seem more sensitive to data interference than other mp3 players do). Also, might not work, but try converting the files using another converter, not iTunes. Take the files you have, download a free mp3 converter...even if the songs are already in mp3 format, select to convert to mp3 anyway. Then re-sync.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	i think there might be a tiny problem with your ipod. try taking it to the Apple Store and having someone look at it to see if something is wrong with it. that's pretty weird because that never happens to my ipod nor does it happen for anyone else i know. maybe its the battery...just take it to the store so they can have a look at it.|`|HZkT0U0Maa	Maybe it needs a new battery.....<br>  <br>  you can fix that if you get a kit, they're only like 10 bucks, and really helpful when your IPod starts acting up..!<br>  <br>  <br>  Jaidon =)

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.

Most of the major camera companies, Nikon, Canon, Sony, and Olympus, to name a few, offer entry level DSLR's for around $500. That should included a body and what is referred to as a "kit" lens.<br>  <br>  However to take macro, fast moving pictures, and portraits, you will probably need more lens's.  The kit lens is is usually a decent lens, but not specialized to take the types of pictures you've listed.<br>  <br>  Although you've not mentioned what amount you are willing to spend, on a "really good camera", to actually purchase a "pro" level camera it's probably more in the $3000 to $8000 range. <br>  <br>  And a person can spend a lot more than that on top quality lens's pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  I'm a Canon fan myself, but I've seen great pictures taken with any of the brands I mentioned before. <br>  <br>  And for every Canon fan, there are Nikon, Sony, and Olympus fans that will swear the brand they shoot with is better! <br>  <br>  Truth be known, it's not the camera! <br>  <br>  It's the shooter!<br>  <br>  I'd be happy to be more helpful, if I knew your price range.<br>  <br>  And yes, I've managed to take at least a few good pics!<br>  <br>  But they're spread over five or six cameras in different price ranges, from the S5 IS ($300) to the 1Ds III ($8000).So which do you want to see?

1z0Yf7k9aa	Well, since I had Madden, and there are NO frame-rate issues, that can't be the problem. I would guess either a problem with the BluRay Disc drive, or the disc might be scratched/dirty.|`|aDWQfWJ3aa	OK, sounds like your discs are dirty, do you keep them out of the case? Do you throw them around when your angry? Maybe just general wear and tear, my advice get a warm flannel, and any soap, lather it up and rub the discs carefully until the marks are gone. If you have scratched your blu-ray discs then you are in trouble, that's pretty hard to do though without deliberately scratching them. If it is none of these your PS3 system is having trouble reading the discs for whatever reason, the only way to fix it is sending it off to Sony if it's under warranty.

CAT-5 is the best hook up. If it is brought in through twisted pair than there will be a back feed coming from the Gateway hooking to the rest of the tvs through Coax.

kUpAQ65Kaa	I've had the Vu and the w580i... in my opinion, i liked the w580i better.<br>  <br>  The Vu touch  screen isn't THAT great. You have to push down on it, it's not like the iPhone's touch screen (which i have now). It lags up from time to time (pretty often). If you're the person who loves to text, I don't prefer this at all. It's slow with texting and not very accurate.<br>  <br>  If you REALLY want it, then go for it. I bought a new one at $300 and don't think it was worth CLOSE to that. Try to get a deal like $100, don't go above that. It's not worth it in my opinion.
vjcEY9Gmaa	Yes, as long as you will buy one with the same specifications/ratings as the original charger. it should have the same voltage and current ratings as required and most importantly the plug will fit into your portable DVD player.<br>  <br>  I would go to Radioshack and ask for assistance as walmart may sell chargers but their sales clerk don't really have technical knowledge.. But if you are sure, then walmart is cheaper..

q1GpAqZnaa	Well, there are many many choices. If you are looking for the most hip phone, it would have to be the IPhone, which is a touch screen phone, which costs a pretty penny, aka not cheap. lol, that would be for AT&T. Though if you are looking for a business phone, then Verizon is a good choice, they have a lot of good blackberry's, like the new one, which is the storm, also a touch screen, which is not that expensive. Also verizon has a lot of other good phones, such as the Razor, which i had for a while, a great phone might i say. <br>  Currently, i am in the Verizon network, and i own the Gylde, and i have to say, it kind of sucks, so try to stay away from other touch screens other than the Iphone for at&t and the Storm. There are many other good phones, just go to Verizon's website, and look at them all. It does not have to be the most expensive, a lot of the phones that are cheaper are better. So pick what you like, or go to other cell phone company's such as at&t, or Cingular.

Phone sex conversation may take many forms, including (but not limited to): guided, narrated, and enacted suggestions; sexual anecdotes and confessions; candid expression of sexual feelings or love; discussion of very personal and sensitive sexual topics; or just two people listening to each other masturbate.<br>  <br>  Phone sex exists both in the context of intimate relationships (e.g., among distanced lovers), and as a commercial transaction between a paying customer and a paid professional.<br>  <br>  Workers<br>  <br>  A phone sex worker is a type of sex worker and erotic actor, sometimes referred to as "phone actor", "fantasy artist", "adult phone entertainer", "audio erotic performer", or any one of other monikers. The most valued attributes of a phone sex professional are his or her voice, acting and/or sexual roleplay skills, along with the experienced ability to discern and respond appropriately to a broad spectrum of customer requests.<br>  <br>  Contrary to appearances, most phone sex operators do not masturbate during every client session; rather, they may vocally simulate masturbation, sexual intercourse, and/or engage in sexual roleplaying scenarios catering to the particular sexual fetish or request of the client. Often these requests involve taboo topics that paying customers cannot engage in during real life sexual encounters due to moral and legal ramifications, psychological inhibition, lack of physical ability, unwillingness of a committed partner or the fear of social stigma. Phone sex operators or companies may, by policy or discretion, refuse to entertain certain requests. Many other services accommodate the extreme taboo market by using signifying phrases in their advertising such as “no taboos” or “no restrictions.” Phone sex and the phone sex worker thus provide a semi-anonymous outlet for such unconventional fantasies without consequence beyond the fee involved in the exchange.<br>  <br>  The most obvious purpose of commercial phone sex may seem to be to provide people with a live masturbation aid, but a select clientele relies on phone sex as a vehicle for revealing intimate thoughts and feelings to a neutral stranger. Phone sex patrons are overwhelmingly male, and for many of these men it is important for their confessor to be a woman, especially when their confessions involve BDSM roles, cross-dressing, pegging, infantilism or homosexual fantasies. It is not uncommon for people to resort to phone sex as an alternative to revealing their secret desires to a therapist, significant other, or friend.<br>  <br>  In effect, the phone sex worker is a surrogate called upon to serve in various roles or capacities specific to each client. In certain cases, a patron may not need a confidant for sexual stimulation, but may simply wish to hear another person's voice, or want to fulfill some other need, such as a sense of nurturing, sympathy, camaraderie, or other form of emotional intimacy.<br>  <br>  Phone sex services primarily market to men or women of a particular sexual orientation, and focus on mainstream sexual experiences. Specialized companies also cater to clients who have a certain sexual predilection (e.g., zoophilia, coprophilia, domination/submission, humiliation) or an erotic interest in a specific group (nurses, firemen, college students, older/younger figures, ethnic minorities, etc.) It is not at all unusual for a phone sex service to employ a staff of phone sex performers to meet both mainstream and exotic customer requests. The panoply of specialized phone sex services available and the vast variety of sexual topics submitted to phone sex workers, reflect the incredibly broad spectrum of human sexual behavior, and are indicative of the general need for a sociosexual outlet which mainstream society often fails to provide.

eG7VKXz9aa	Sorry to say but, no. There's no way AT&T or Apple will fix it if there's water damage. <br>  <br>  Even if the phone falls within the one year warranty or you bought the AppleCare Plan, neither covers water damage. And AT&T phone insurance does not cover iPhones or PDAs at all. My parents recently upgraded to iPhones and were informed upon doing so that their insurance would be dropped and only apply to my brother's phone.<br>  <br>  I've heard many stories on various forums about how you can call Apple, report a problem and leave out any hint of water damage. They'll send you a box to ship your phone to them in but you'll get it back with a letter of some sort saying something along the lines of "Sorry, buy a new one" since they'll immediately crack it open and see the indicator strips have changed color. <br>  <br>  For future reference though, the only way to insure your phone against theft, water damage or accidental damage (none of which Apple or AT&T cover) is to insure it through an outside company. Some insurance companies offer insurance for the phone for as little as $15 a year.|`|7KDrPsSFaa	everyone else pretty much answered the question,<br>  but i have this exact problem right now.<br>  my home button doesn't work and i am trapped in my text messages app.<br>  i took it to apple and they said, "hell no" when i asked if they could replace it.<br>  HOWEVER, the guy i spoke to said that when it costs a lot for apple to fix it, they recommend customers go to IRESQ.COM and they will fix it for less than $200 (as opposed to buying a new one for 399, since you don't get the upgraded price of 199).<br>  <br>  my iphone has been sitting in a bag of rice for 2 days.<br>  if it doesn't work when i try it tonight, i'm sending it to iresq.com|`|kUpAQ65Kaa	If you have warranty (which you should if you bought it in the last year, not sure about 2 years).<br>  <br>  Go to AT&T and ask them. Make an excuse that sounds accidental, because they wont replace it if it was on an intentional move.<br>  <br>  If they say no, go to an Apple store. If there isn't one near you, call and ask if there's anything you can do.|`|r1pMegENaa	Nope.  There is a little strip of paper inside that changes color for water damage.  The don't replace it if it changed colors.....sorry.|`|AA10112346	not unless you got insurance for it.|`|z88IMXNFaa	No, there isn't.  The iPhone comes with a one year warranty.

AA11056614	Discrete 7.1 audio is fairly rare right now, but will probably become somewhat more common with time. That said, I don't see it ever becoming common. Furthermore, unless you have a fairly big room you won't get much benefit from 7.1 vs 6.1 or 5.1 sound.<br>  <br>  However, how you perceive audio may be quite different than how I (or anyone else) perceive(s) it. In reality large increases in cost are associated with relatively incremental improvements in sound, and most of us look for a balance between performance/quality and cost.<br>  <br>  I recently upgraded my sound system to take advantage of "lossless" audio formats (and to be able to get discrete 7.1 sound), and while I can hear improvements (from the relatively few disks that support it) the difference is fairly subtle. So, will you hear "a major difference?", most likely not ... but what seems incremental or subtle to me may be major for you.<br>  <br>  I suggest you try to find a store with a demo room capable of playing your example disk in 7.1 (or a friend with a good sound system) and judge for yourself. Anything else, including my input, is simply another person's opinion.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	No, 7.1 will not improve John Mayer. His sappy, repetitive, college girl, easy listening songs will sound just as crappy as it does on a 5.1 system. With the right speakers the music will be clearer and in more channels, but it won't make it any easier to listen to. :-)<br>  <br>  But seriously, as the guy above me said, it's a matter of perception and personal preference. There is a much bigger difference between 5.1 and stereo than there is between 5.1 and 7.1 sound. It's a bit like the 480p/720p/1080p comparison. 720 is MUCH better than 480, but the difference is less dramatic when comparing 720 and 1080.

oOCR9Arbaa	First of all does your computer recognize the ipod? If not you might wanna try a new cable. Also try restarting the ipod by holding down the middle and the menu button ant the same time fo rabout 3-5 seconds (sometimes more) until the little apple logo shows up. Then try. If its still not putting songs on then go to your Itunes and if your computer recognizes your ipod correctly it should say the name of your ipod on the side where all the playlists are and the little icon. You click on that and a menu shows up with your ipod and your free space, On the top theres little tabs. click on Music and there shoudl be a list of your play lists itll say "Sync only checked playlists" and "Sync all" click the sync all OR click all the playlists with the songs you want to show up on your ipod. then press sync and TADA that should do it. if not you could call apple support.

Xbox live has way more features for online like private chat, its easier to join a party game (especially on Cod), you can send voice messages, if there is an update to a game (like new maps for cod) Xbox gets them first most of the time. When games are multi-platform, the games are geared toward Xbox live, meaning some features don't work on the Ps3 that work on the Xbox.<br>  Only Problem is it cost about 50 bucks a year.|`|7YGPR2ohaa	Actually you can play music when u play games now, just not every game and the ps3 is component compatible.

Xxviy63Paa	The thin clear piece of plastic is the sensor pad. Open the controller back up and look how each black spot on the sensor pad is touched by the button when it's pressed. In fact, plug in the controller while it's open, and press the various buttons. Don't worry, the controller doesn't get high voltage or current. Just a few volts on normal resistance.<br>  <br>  The best way to reassemble a DS2, if that's what it is, is to turn the top half upside down and put the buttons in. Make sure you don't get them backwards, cause it's upside down. There is a plastic piece that fits under the d-pad, which makes it pop back up again after being pressed. Make sure that fits well. Then put the sensor pad in on top of the buttons, and lower the bottom half into place.<br>  <br>  If you can post a link to a photo of the controller when it's open, I can tell you if there's anything broken.

Usually you need more than just the BlackBerry unlimited internet account to watch Youtube and it will cost more.

For an additional $14.95 per month I can watch cable TV, Free to Air TV and various forms of streaming video. Check with your service provider if you really want to have access to streaming video.<br>  <br>  BTW, you will generally need 3G, not 2.5G to watch.

w06Xv6XYaa	When phones are released to a certain carrier they are "locked" to that carrier. There is special software that you can use that "unlocks" it, allowing you to use it on any carrier.<br>  <br>  Ill use the iphone as an example. The iPhone was made to use with AT&T and AT&T only. Using the software, the phone is set free from this lock allowing you to use it with T-Mobile, Sprint, etc.<br>  <br>  You dont need an unlocked phone unless the phone you want was not made for your carrier. Having a phone that is unlocked doesnt make it any better than a locked phone.|`|RCdm5LzAaa	you can unlock almost any gsm cell phone here:  <a href="http://www.gsmunlocklabs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsmunlocklabs.com/</a>|`|SE8TzHjtaa	An unlocked phone is a phone that can do all that is was supposed to do in the first place, and read whatever SIM card and not just AT&T or T-Mobile or whoever.<br>  There better then Locked phones.|`|eiIRfOTiaa	It means the phone is unlocked

XmcHVvlfaa	With your past experience, I'm sure it'll be easy to get another position with another cell phone company. Maybe instead of selling cell phone plans, you can consider working FOR THE CELL PHONE MAKERS. Such as Motorola and LG and Sony Ericsson and such. Advertising? I'm sure it's about the same, maybe more oppotunities to move up the ladder. My friend works for Nokia and they've got quite a number of perks. ;)|`|uaYDfH2Qaa	I have seen ads for Verizon on Craigslist and maybe some other job search sites...don't know how legit they are :}

If it's the first, match the brands and match the type of lens mount. Current Canon SLRs use the Ef lens mount and the consumer DSLRs will also use EF-S. <br>  <br>  If it's the second, it should say somewhere in the item description.
1z0Yf7k9aa	No. Most of the time it's the games fault. You usually notice a drop when it goes below 30, and that's usually when all the action goes on.|`|VEDzTb4zaa	Nah circulation won't have a huge part in it. If you are talking about online gaming then lag + lots of action can result in awful frame rate. But if your offline in single player mode then probably it should only occur when a lot of action is taking place. If it is happening when nothing extreme is happening then replace the game<br>  <br>  Hope that helps

af96mcl1aa	Well if it doesn't turn on, then you probably did short it out. I would let it thoroughly air dry first, before even messing with it. I think it also depends on if its a wireless or not. The wireless may have a harder time.<br>  <br>  Ive done this with both my 360's and PS3's controllers before. Spilled coke all up in both of them. Rinsed them off, and let em air dry, and they work just fine still. <br>  <br>  Good luck. :)

Basically it is something for video cameras.  It is a unit that plugs into your T.V via the audio/vided plugs and then plugs into your computer via USB port.  You use a recording software to record the footage being displayed on the T.V.
N9nJWYa5aa	Not that use a sensor bar (as far as I'm aware).  But there are several mice that use 3D motion sensing.  The easiest to find and with best support would be from Logitech - I think it's called the MX Air or something.

Y7qLedwkaa	I would just call them and tell them your would like to claim insurance on your Glyde due to <insert problem here>. See what they say. Typically insurance only covers the original owner and will not transfer to another customer, so you don't have much footing if they tell you no. However, if you've been paying for insurance on your bill this whole time, you'd be entitled to a refund.
JdeNnTYhaa	Honestly, if you get the lower priced ones,  you get a crappy reception.  The brand I used to have was Monster and that was decent.  You do have to pay a bit more as they range from 60 something to over 100 bucks but at least you get good reception as opposed to the lower priced stuff.

Antenna To Buy<br>  <br>  HDTV antennas act like their analog counterparts. They receive the signal that is broadcast “in the clear” and transmit it to the tv that they are connected to. So in order to get the best HDTV experience, the most important accessory to consider purchasing is an antenna. Your signal is only as good as its weakest link so make sure you don’t saddle your best HDTV to a low quality antenna. However, there’s no difference between so-called HDTV antennas and the “regular” ones.<br>  <br>  2. Receiver To Buy<br>  <br>  Receivers replace antenna when considering getting your signals from cable or from satellite providers. The most popular satellite provider is Directv (with Dish Network coming in second place). Directv provides a full digital signal and as part of its service will provide an HDTV tuner or HDTV receiver and in order to receive the signal, Directv will provide an HDTV dish that will be able to receive the digital signal. One of the most exciting features that Directv supplies is the HDTV DVR which allows you to record your favorite shows in high def.

8vApQ8Tcaa	Yes you can, but it will do you no good. You will need an "Unlock" code. Ebay has several sellers that offer these codes and instruction on how to put them in. When you put the wrong kind of SIM card into the phone it will likely ask you for a SUBSIDY password or a Restriction password.

It has a good camera and Samsung "touchwiz" interface is pretty good. The touch screen is nice but It doesn't have a keyboard so if you are a heavy texter then it wouldn't be good for you. I normally text in class without looking at my phone and it would be impossible to do that with the behold! there are no keys to feel so you would have to constantly look down.<br>  <br>  The blackberry curve is a great phone if you need your business/work to go with you. Blackberry's are more directed towards the "busy professional."<br>  <br>  The G1 is a good combination of the two. It has a full web browser like the berry, touchscreen like the behold and a full keyboard (unlike the behold.) The best thing about the G1 is the operating system. I know the phone is ugly but once you use the phone you will forget all about its "ugliness", lol. The home screen (3 of them) is really cool because you can customize them in so many ways. There are also tons of apps in the android market to enhance your phone.<br>  <br>  Get the G1 and I promise you that you wont regret it!

zpmXGZsCaa	You can sequence synthesizers from DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations like Cakewalk, Sonar, Cubase, Logic (Mac,) or ProTools.  Sequencing is simply plugging in the notes and then sending that to the synth.  The synth will play exactly what you've written.  The cheapest DAW for a Windows based computer is  Cakewalk USB Midi Pack, $50.  It also comes with a USB/Midi interface cable which allows you to connect your computer to your synthsizer (when you get one that is.)  <br>  <br>  BTW, Aphex Twin uses all sorts of synths, so no one single synth will give you the Aphex sound.  For a modern synth, I'd go with the Alesis Micron or the tried and true Korg Microkorg.  For a good alalog polyphonic synth, I like the Roland Alpha Juno (1 or 2) or its rack version, the Roland MKS-50.<br>  <br>  Digital pianos, and low end home keyboards are fine for home use, but not Aphex Twin synth sounds.<br>  <br>  The Yamaha MM6 is a good synth - it excells at piano, electric piano, and organ sounds.  Its synth section is good too.  $450 is a good price as they are usually around $600.

HVQFVtelaa	The stylus looks like the ones on the old Shure cartridges, an M-91ED, M-93ED, M-95ED, etc., but you would need to check the cartridge for a name and number to match to be sure. It could be something else. <br>  <br>  If you can't find the cartridge number, just replace the whole cartridge, but make sure to be careful with the tiny clips, use needle nose pliers and be gentle. <br>  <br>  Also if you change the cartridge, have someone show you how to re-set the tracking weight on the tone arm if you don't know how. On most tonearms it only takes a minute.

So you could subscribe to Sky if you wanted and get a free box.<br>  Or get a box off E-bay cheap and buy a Freesat Card.<br>  Or buy a BBC/ITV Freesat box which you can get in High Definition TV on, if you want , they will all work with your current TV as long as it has a Scart input ( which i am sure it does ).

They turn a bright fluorescent color (usually pink) if they come in contact with even a drop of water.  I have heard of times where the device has been ruined by water yet the stickers never came in contact with liquid so they will replace it.

42tTsVuxaa	There are so many formats, but there are a few that will come up again and again. <br>  <br>  At the top of your list will be uncompressed video, the problem is that the files are huge, and there are no real benefits.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_formats" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_forma...</a><br>  <br>  Avi for me would be at the top of the list, although it is compressed the quality is till very good even after many re edits.<br>  <br>  Mpeg 2 is ok to edit but not very good if you need to re edit the footage. <br>  <br>  then you start to get into the higher compression formats, enabling cameras with relatively small media storage to hold huge amounts of data/video. If you compare Avi ( about 5 Min's = 1gb) to some of the others which would be not even 10% of that. <br>  <br>  As for quality, that's hard but as a rough rule the higher the compression the lower the quality. Many of todays compressed video formats are very good, but to edit them you need, computer that will handle the pressure, not many will edit an hours worth of video in the time line.  <br>  <br>  Again, most of the Editing packages capture Mini-dv as a Avi, all packages will import Avi. Formats (not all) need to be converted, before  you can import them, many are increasing their video import lists. <br>  <br>  Depending on your Camera, and what media it uses will depend on the best video format you use, Converting from one format to another is not always the best solution, but sometimes it is your only option. <br>  <br>  Have a good look at the link above and it will help to explain some of the formats. <br>  <br>  Go to www.videohelp.com there are some very good sections on video format. <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  RR|`|RwNqGx2yaa	avi has the best quality, flv has small file size,|`|b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa	AVI isn't a video format - it's a container file format.  The content could be MiniDV, MPEG-4 or any arbitrary format.  MiniDV's lightly compressed and good for editing, but it uses a lot of (cheap!) disk space.  MPEG-4 (XviD, DivX, h.264) is very heavily compressed and not good for editing.  It's very watchable though, if it's been encoded well.

You can usually tell which format it is in by the size of the file. If the film size is around 700MB - 900MB then it most likely needs converting. I myself prefered to purchase a divx player as they are relitively cheap and allow you to get approx six films on one dvd disc.

They are so helpful and will walk you through what you need to do.

Any brand will do, it doesn't have to be the particular brand they showed on the website. Lots of choices for that card type. For a 12.1 mp camera i would go with a good quality 4 gb SDHC card. It should hold roughly 600 photos.

VEDzTb4zaa	3 Knockturn Alley<br>  <br>  First you appear in a shop called Borgin & Burkes. Search the cupboards and<br>  shelves for items then go in the black door and a CS will follow. After it you<br>  will have to go and get the book as shown in the CS. The hand will attack you if<br>  you start running near it so creep by half tilting the left analogue stick only<br>  very slightly. Once you have found it equip Lumos and go through to the back of<br>  the cupboard where the CS was. Use Lumos in the dark area to reveal a secret<br>  passage. Push it and go through it.<br>  <br>  Boss: Imp<br>  <br>  Lock-on the Imp and cast an uncharged Flipendo at it. Look out for the Vases.<br>  <br>  Climb up the wall by running against it then more Imps will appear. Cast<br>  Flipendo at them like before and run up to the two cages to drop them in.<br>  Pick up the FWAWC and climb onto to the cage and up the wall. Smash the jar on<br>  the bookcase to the right then carry on going to the right and you will find a<br>  TB. Press x at it to open it you will get an owl treat. Go to the far left and<br>  you will come across a stick in the shape of a number seven. Use the "Call<br>  Hedwig" option, read the message and press x. Next use the "Feed Hedwig" option<br>  and it will bring a ladder down for you. Climb up the ladder, use Lumos to<br>  reveal cracks in the floor and avoid them. When you reach the end of the room go<br>  to the left to obtain a FWAWC. Go back and crawl through the crawling space in<br>  the wall. When you have gone through it open the door, go through it then go<br>  down the steps. Once you've done that keep going upwards until you reach some<br>  boxes. Go up against the wall next to them then keep going left until you've<br>  past the boxes. Go forward until you reach a box by itself. Press x on it and<br>  pull it by using the left analogue stick to reveal a yellow button. You will<br>  come across a lot of these in the game. Push it using x then go back to the<br>  steps. Go through the other door (Not the one on the steps) and open the TB to<br>  get a FWAWC. Push the yellow button in the room then go left, up and open the<br>  door.
1HtTxOOQaa	First thing you will have to consider is do you want a quad core or a dual core processor? Quad cores are 2wice as fast as dual cores, but all the above games you have mentioned will works on dual cores as good as on a quad core. The main reason why I am stressing is because Intel just introduces Core i7 processors(the processor is more expensive than your budget!!!) and so now Dual cores are going out of fashion in sometime. It's better if you install a Quad core processor as games like GTA4(recommended) and nearly all future games will require Quad core.<br>  Get only Intel processors.<br>  <br>  Other thing is RAM. Get ample off it. Rams are cheap now-a-days. Get DDR3 if you can. 4GB will be ample. Ask for Kingston Rams cause they are reliable and you also get 3 year warranty<br>  <br>  Coming to the most important hardware-Graphic card. Just buy a 512MB GPU from NVIDIA. I know there are a lot of variants, but please invest the most in buying the GPU cause this actually is the heart of gaming. the NVIDIA 8000 or 9000 series are the place to look for.<br>  <br>  HD: Doesn't affect gaming. Buy one with sufficient space-320GB or 500GB.<br>  <br>  Mother board: Just ask the guy to get one which supports the processor, RAM and GPU you are planning to buy.<br>  <br>  The Quad core is around 320 AD(a good one-you also get cheap ones),Ram won't cost much(4 GB DDR2 will be around 120 AD, DDR3 will really be out off budget), get a GPU worth the same as the processor or even more. HD also is really cheap.<br>  <br>  If you can't remember all off these stuff, just tell the guy that you want to run Crysis on your PC and the budget is 1500 AD. He will understand cause if your PC can run Crysis on a high setting, then it can run any game on this planet.|`|PUiPeJqVaa	If you want the games to run smoothly, look on the recommended system requirements and not on the minimum ones..<br>  dunno how to convert aus dollar to us dollar though..<br>  maybe you'll need a quad core processor (pentium) or maybe amd phenom will do..<br>  about 3GB ram<br>  a 512mb (or 1gig) 256bit GDDR3 video card<br>  a 250GB harddisk (Western Digitel) 7200RPM

xTNaKNOcaa	As the music in iTunes is encrypted with DRM, you cannot directly put it on any non-Apple MP3 player.

Make sure that you have the latest firmware version- v20.149 . It has a number of improvements, including its performance and working speed, and new applications. You won't get a better phone within that price. Or, if you can pay more, you can go for Nokia N79 or 5800 XpressMusic, but I don't have any practical experience on them.

These vehicles are simply purchased from their respective dealerships (sometimes at discount due to the region affiliation of the creator) and decked out with decals and fancy paint.

I know it's lame, but these vehicles are no more or less special than those you can obtain in the game yourself.<br>  <br>  The key factor to making them special to you is whether you have actually earned the ability to purchase them in the game or not based on your current level, region affiliation, and cash flow.|`|k2D0e1K4aa	people spend for ever! editing their cars on forza 2 all though its a great game|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	theres people with such skill and time on there.

Verizon is unlikely to allow a Sprint phone on their system, and there's not necessarily any way to unlock it, in the sense of GSM unlocking.<br>  <br>  Of course, it is probably more hackable than the usual CDMA cellphone, being a PDA phone and all... so it might be possible. I would personally wait and see if anyone manages this. <br>  <br>  In fact, I may do this myself.. I'm currently on Verizon, and looking for a good PDAphone, a market Verizon doesn't seem to address (sorry, Blackberrys just don't cut it), since my Palm 700p died last fall. Top contenders are the Pre and the G1, but neither Sprint nor T-Mobile has good coverage in my area (they don't reach my house). So I'm not sure which way to go, but a Pre on Verizon might solve the problem.
AA11056614	Google "best Blu-ray player" and you will find several comparative reviews (the 3rd link below is to one of the better ones).<br>  <br>  But I want to focus on the results of my search for a player. While only recommended for those who value excellent video and audio performance over loading speed and "the latest" features, the best deal right now is, arguably, the Pioneer BDP51FD from 6th Avenue Electronics. This is the $600 MSRP model that is in all important ways is almost the same as the $800 MSRP Pioneer Elite BPD-05FD ... but is on sale for $284. (link 1).  Most professional reviews were on players with early firmware. Since V1.17 (Current V1.25a) this player has really come into it's own.<br>  <br>  The main pros are: excellent build quality and components; exemplary DVD scaling, CD audio quality (Audiophiles rate it as one of the best CD players available), and BD video quality; multichannel analog audio with built in support for Dolby TrueHD (and DTS HD master to follow via a firmware update); excellent "tweekability".<br>  <br>  The main cons are: it is Profile 1.1 (and can't be updated to 2.0 ... which means no internet connectivity for updates or on-line extras ... but relative to audio and video quality this is relatively unimportant); relatively slow DVD layer change on some disks, limited bass management over analog audio outs, some reports of sensitivity to scratches on disks.<br>  <br>  The second link is to an owners thread ... and many posts point out that this is one of the best Blu-ray players out there in terms of performance and quality. Overpriced at $600,  but a steal at $284.  Most of what you need to know is in the first few posts at the second link (e.g. #7).<br>  <br>  Again .. this is a player for the videophile/audiophile ... not for those looking for glitz.<br>  <br>  Other choices are summarized at the 3rd link.|`|8JTHQMk1aa	I would personally go with the SonyBDP-S350.

There's a 55 model which is the 35 with some overpriced analog outputs.<br>  <br>  Samsung has the BD-P2550, 2500 and 1500.  The first two are very good while the 1500 is good enough.<br>  <br>  Sony has the BDP-S350 and 550.  They are both good players.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/1770-9991_7-0.html?query=blu-ray&searchtype=products&sort=edRating7%20desc&rpp=10&tag=ltcol;narrow" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/1770-9991_7-0.ht...</a>|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I recommend Samsung BD-P1500 1080p Blu-ray Player.This Bluray player works great. I paid for about $200 here on amazon with free shipping. Excellent player at an excellent price! You can update the firmware to be BD Live capable. I personally have not done this as I don't really care for the current features of BD Live. <br>  <br>  PROs- Quality player, quiet, very stylish, samsung anynet+ which allows you to control the bluray player by pointing the remote to the TV. This works great for me as I have the player hidden in a closet. Lastly Price. <br>  <br>  Cons- The only negative thing I have to say about the player it that it does not have a chapter skip button. It does have a fastforward button that lets you fast forward from 2x to 160x I think maybe even 320x (not sure on the 320 I can't remember.) <br>  <br>  All in all a great player. I highly recommend. <br>  <br>  Price: $199.90 Free Shipping <br>  <br>  <a href="http://blu-ray-player.co.cc/cheap-493964-B0014H16V0-Samsung_BD_P1500_1080p_Blu_ray_Player.html" rel="nofollow">http://blu-ray-player.co.cc/cheap-493964...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-BD-P1500-1080p-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B0014H16V0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1236704828&sr=1-1&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-BD-P1500-1...</a>

3K3Law9uaa	if u want  u can go for d ever green nokia for its build quality.overall nokia is d better option. KP 220 has good features but camera clarity is not so good as nokia|`|j2SVdhIsaa	I prefer Nokia 3110c|`|kfuA1RBoaa	LG 220
j2SVdhIsaa	just wait for 10minutes then it will work
VEDzTb4zaa	Depends do you want to take it with you where ever you go? Do you want to play multiplayer with your friends when they are around? Do you mainly want online play? Do you want a large variety of titles? You must way all of this up if you want a cheap, portable system (which is extremely fun) go for the lite and you wont be disappointed!! If you want to play with your friends, or play online, or  have a large range of titles then go for the WII!!! but remember the WII does have re-occuring costs such as subscription, more controllers, chargers. Where as the lite you only need batteries and a game then your off! You decide my friend<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|8bxqujFnaa	I own both and they are both great. they have their own positives and negatives. I prefer the wii. The wii has a ot more options for games and and special features such as mii's. Its great if you want to have a couple of friends over and play a few games for some fun but is also great for playing solo. The ds however, is great for playing by yourself. Youcan only play mutliplayer on it if you have another one. I find that most of the games get finished quickly and that the ocntrols to play those games with are not so great. I ahve 15 on ds and i have finished the ones that can be finished. While on my wii i have about 20 something and i havent finished any of them. Wii- 7/10. DS- 5/10|`|1wDeFuTSaa	i personally think u shud buy a wii...... most of the games of ds n& wii are same.....ds is good cos its portable & is touch screen.... the new model of ds - dsi has even two 0.3 built-in cameras....wii is gud cos its motion control is fun & all the multiplayer is fun. nice shop channel feels fun to surf net on tv , photos , news , forecasts , games etc......     finally its on u if u want a portable ds or the that connects on a tv.............|`|M0w7mLEqaa	I would wait and get the dsi|`|2KfQYXaiaa	They are very different.<br>  Personally I find more game options for the DS over the Wii.<br>  However the Wii is MUCH more multiplayer based.|`|3Tlq60FTaa	I have both and they are equally both great !!<br>  <br>  Nintendo wii is great if you want to play with other people.<br>  Nintendo DS Lite is great for on the go.<br>  <br>  If you get the DS Lite let me know, you'll never have to buy another game ever again and all the games from A-Z for the NES, SNES & MEGADRIVE, you can play on your DS Lite including all the new games on the DS Lite aswell.<br>  <br>  The Graphics are perfect on the DS lite, not so great on the wii but it's just so much fun !!!<br>  <br>  Whatever you decided to pick you'll love either of them..|`|37rqJ1XBaa	having both consoles right now, I really enjoy both, actually you can interact both consoles on some games (like pokemon, animal crossing)<br>  <br>  both gaming consoles have innovative controls, for the DS, it has touchscreen controls, the wii has motion sensor.<br>  <br>  If your more on the go, then the DS is for you because it is portable with a good battery life and nice games.<br>  <br>  but if you are introvert, the wii can be really entertaining, it has great games (in my opinion), can play online for free (via friend codes), and can help you become more active.|`|yHc0PAmfaa	well the wii:<br>  <br>  can view internet browser, news, weather, shop channel and mii's.\<br>  <br>  the shop channel u can buy old games from sega, nes snes N64.. ect<br>  <br>  The has good game like<br>  Zelda twilight princess<br>  resident evil 4<br>  metroid prime<br>  cod 5 <br>  guitar hero<br>  <br>  this video shows pros and cons of wii<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Nr9tgWwhw&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Nr9tgWw...</a><br>  <br>  Nintendo DS<br>  <br>  has 2 touchscreen's, good mario games.. mario kart, super mario ds, new super mario bros.<br>  <br>  If u dont think u will get over the gimmick touchscreen go with it. <br>  <br>  pros and cons video<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLwiYtRsThs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLwiYtRsT...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  In the end i would go for the one that has games u like..|`|xwEPYEqSaa	It would be a mistake getting a Wii since there is very little 3rd party support. <br>  <br>  DS has a lot better 3rd party support, Nintendo supports it better and you can take it anywhere. It has games like Pokemon Platinum, Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon, Metroid Prime Hunters and Assassin's Creed. <br>  <br>  <br>  DS is the better of those two but the best system overall is the Playstation 3. I would get it if I were you it has a built in Blu-Ray player as well.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	First a correction on a previous answer:<br>  there's no fees to play online with the Wii.<br>  <br>  That being said- They're both great products. <br>  <br>  The DS is a clamshell design so the screens are protected at all times when closed. I've dropped mine a few more times than I'd care to admit- and it's cruising along fine. It's been about 3 yrs now- the only complaint is a few scratches on the case. Loads of games available.  You may want to wait a few weeks and get a DSi with a few more options like a browser and camera.<br>  <br>  The Wii is a  motion control based console that is loads and loads of fun. the graphics are weaker than the other two main systems, but are still great. You do have the option of downloading old games and small studio games directly to your hard drive, not to mention you can play old GameCube games on it. If you end up with both the DS & Wii- you can download DS demos from your Wii ^_^

x98z1Mx5aa	It sounds like your computer could be over heating when you play. I wouldn't be to worried about it my laptop does that from time to time depending on the game I'm playing. This is what the fan is for, to cool your system down. If it get's to hot your computer will shut off automatically and this is normal..it does this so it won't fry the hard drive. If you want to be 100% sure then call geek squad or something of the sort and get help from the professionals.|`|qs9QHvy9aa	Sounds to me like the game is raising the temperature of your processor, and therefor telling your fan to speed up.  Its normal for intensive games.  not a big deal.|`|TFio3nEEaa	Pull the slot fan out. Blower style fans are noisy compared to a 120mm fan. Your fan will speed up when a set temperature is reached and slow down when it goes below that mark. If PNY has a fan controller program that was included you can change that temp setting. Blocking air flow can raise temperatures too; so the more stuff you have crammed in there can effect it. Otherwise you're just going to have to live with the noise if you have a built-in blower style fan on your card.|`|xTvI7Qo3aa	with all that additional hardware you may be over working your factory  power supply and and under high demand situations causing  it to have a voltage drop make sure that the combined laod of all your fans and drives is less than the out put of your power supply or its possible that the case fan is plugged into the CPU fans socket? (which is usually thermostaticly <~~~ (spelled wrong ) controlled by the temp of the cpu) cycling faster when the cpu gets above a preset limit and slower when it drops back below it. just a couple of possibilities for you to think about and you may be able to adjust the fans temperature settings in the bios (boot options) by hitting F2 or delete during start up
mVUpt8waaa	Same as on the web site, $419.  If it is cheaper at the store, it wont be by much, maybe $10 or so.

rhqed2kYaa	there seems to be some ambiguity surounding this issue. All retail stores, apple AT&T best buy and otherwise all require 2 year contracts with the iPhone period. The only way to purchase one without a contract would be criagslist or eBay. It is written into the apple and AT&T licensing for the iPhone that they all require two year contracts and apple, being the elitist company that they are will not make any exceptions. You may purchase the iPhone at an apple store and just pay the cancellation fee, but either way you're going to have a tough time finding out from a legitimate store without a contract. Sort for the bad news but I hope this helps.|`|JoQFqoTSaa	Yeah lots of stores here sell iphones without contracts but you can also search craigslist.com to see people who are selling iphones 16gb probably 500-700|`|cqnEZsRBaa	all iphone purchases require a 2 yr contract at $299
88tSYTnZaa	i have one and i like it you should get it its a pretty good and cool phone everybody tells me they want my phone and its cool and all this **** lol|`|GRLrS12Naa	I got one about 2.5 weeks ago. <br>  <br>  At the moment, im still loving/hating it. The reasons:<br>  <br>  1. Email is great, like all of the BB's. In saying that, you can still get the same email functionality using another BB besides the Storm.<br>  <br>  2. The touchscreen is OK. I havent had a touch-screen phone before, so im getting used to it still. I find my ear bumps the screen on occasion and sets it to mute.<br>  <br>  3. The net is OK on it too. Comes bundled (Vodafone-AU) with a lot of applications like YouTube, all the IM clients, FaceBook, Flickr<br>  <br>  4. Its not an iPhone. Im not a big fan of apple, hence me not going down that path. much better email than apple<br>  <br>  5. Battery life isnt great, but i hear the latest firmware (in past week) makes a difference. I have to charge 1x per day<br>  <br>  6. Moves away unfortunately from the standard mini-USB cable for data/charge. Means that you need to buy extra accessories. I was assured in the shop that it was the same, and since found out its not. That really annoyed me.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Im glad i got it. Its expensive + long contract, but i think ill be happy in the end.

6GB5P7ojaa	Do NOT get an iPhone 3G. It is VERY, VERY FAR from being an excellent phone. It will also be hassle, trust me. I would prefer Blackberry among all of these since, Xperia looks and functions terribly, Omnia's touch screen is laggy, and like I said, the iPhone 3G is VERY,VERY FAR from being an excellent phone.<br>  <br>  The only things the iPhone 3G attracts are its capacitive touch screen, App Store, Cydia (Installer), glossy finish (which is a fingerprint magnet). Blackberry is the most excellent one on your list. It is really made for people who use smart-phones and it will really give you the essential tools for business managing on the go. The Xperia's look is too horrible. Also, it's Windows Mobile 6.1 (which is fairly poor, that's why everybody's waiting for WinMo 6.5 and WinMo 7). The Omnia's Touch UI is horrible for touching. Also, its touch screen is really, really laggy.<br>  <br>  So, as a result, your best bet is Blackberry.|`|HctybHFvaa	IPHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  if not then <br>  BLACKBERRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|YJH5YcjBaa	i'd say i phone or g 1 or the sidekick lx..not the sidekick 2008 [newest] that one is lame...like many many many teenagers your age have those[sidekick lx] its cute/cool<br>  <br>  it can range from 300<br>  <br>  <br>  the i phone and g1 are around400<br>  <br>  <br>  and remember you get what yah pay for so dont pay less because there mightbe a trick to it|`|QEOx27CUaa	look on the net,you will find all the info.and prices,and what each ones details are,then you can make an informed choice...|`|ed8e351d95ea3f9caab6cc8e923f7782aa	Blackberry best business tool.<br>  <br>  iPhone is the most fun.|`|e598449d055c2ea33bc5dbaf4738f950aa	Xperia;-)|`|5IJO3bzpaa	i have the lg dare it is verizon, it is a good phone reasonably priced.

SKkE3fK1aa	A USB Cable for your phone should come with the phone (in the box) when you got it. If not, then you should buy one in the LG Store (not in your Service Provider Center).<br>  <br>  Connect your phone via USB and if it is your first time, you should wait for your computer to recognize and install your phone's drivers/software.<br>  <br>  Once that's done, you can access your memory card in My Computer. Also take note that your phone might ask you which setting to use so be sure to check out your phone once you connect it.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, try buying a memory card reader for microSD (that's your memory card). You can also buy a standard memory card reader for less the price, but you also need to buy a memory card adapter (<a href="http://images.tigerdirect.ca/itemDetails/T555-1122/T555-1122-callout.jpg)." rel="nofollow">http://images.tigerdirect.ca/itemDetails...</a> Then, connect your card reader via USB with the memory card in and you can transfer files much like a USB FlashDrive.|`|bC25b4XVaa	Hey check this article out, it's about how to transfer files between pc and mobile phone:<br>  <a href="http://www.eastmobiles.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=94:transfer-files-laptop-mobile&catid=34:bluetooth&Itemid=62" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastmobiles.com/index.php?opt...</a>|`|Ru3PBiAbaa	You can use three methods.<br>  <br>  1) If all your data is on the memory card:<br>  Remove the memory card and insert it in its adapter and then insert it in the slot if present on your computer. This is not a good method(especially on a bluetooth mobile) and usually takes a lot of time. If it is not present then move on to the next method.<br>  <br>  2) If your computer has bluetooth enabled then:<br>  Switch it on (both of computer and of mobile) and then pair it with the mobile. For this just open the bluetooth menu of your mobile and select the PAIRING option which will list the currently bluetooth enabled devices. Select your computer from the list and follow the instructions. It will ask you for passkey that you can enter on your own on both the devices.<br>  Now whenever you have to send a file from your mobile to your computer or vice versa, just select "SEND" option on your mobile/computer and select 'via blueooth' and select the desired device to which you have to send the file.<br>  <br>  3) You can also use a USB cable that came with your mobile (if it did not then buy one) and then just connect your mobile and your computer through that cable and it will install the device. If there is a driver disk provided to you, then first install the driver and then connect the devices.<br>  <br>  Hope this will help you.<br>  <br>  And any ways HAPPY HOLI.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you like the answer select it as a best answer.|`|oFzm4HUWaa	You can use a USB cable if they gave you one, a memory chip if they gave you one, transfer via bluetooth if your computer is newer and has bluetooth on it, or the good old fashioned e-mailing. if you would like further help you can e-mail me at    mollydrayton@comcast.net    for step by step for whichever applies.|`|9fACvJ2Kaa	msn/email: chinawholeseller@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  If you want iphone clone phones & brand phone projector phones or chinese phones Pls email me!!<br>  <br>  We are from china.

Your requests are pretty standard so finding one shouldn't be hard. I go through cell phones like crazy (i have iPhone now, worth every penny!) and in my experience Samsung makes the best phones hands down. I have taken pictures with them and put them on my computer and then gotten them printed and the quality is amazing!!!<br>  If you go to your service providers page you can limit your search for the credentials you have listed. (i know at&t does not sure about the others, i am assuming).<br>  Happy Searching!
CQA4HAdmaa	As I mentioned above I’ve successfully used headphone mics with my 2nd Gen iPod Touch. These have included a generic model and the Monster Cable iSoniTalk.<br>  <br>  Today I successfully tried using a couple of external mics. First you need a camcorder-style A/V mini plug cable. These have four conductors on the single mini plug and terminate with three RCA-type connectors. It should be noted that the iPod Touch wiring is different from a camcorder.<br>  White -> left audio out,<br>  Yellow -> right audio out,<br>  Red <- mic input.<br>  <br>  You will also obviously need whatever cable adapters and gender changers to get your mic connected to a two conductor (unbalanced, unpowered) RCA input.<br>  <br>  I successfully tested the following mics into the iPod Touch:<br>  - AKG C1000S (with internal 9V battery for mic power)<br>  - Korg CM-2M (one channel only)<br>  - Microphone Madness MM-HLSC1 (Sennheiser) with and without a battery box for the mic.<br>  <br>  The results in each case were satisfactory. I didn’t do any further testing to evaluate signal quality. Note there is no level trim within FourTrack. But it seems to do some sort of level calibration on startup. So connect the mic before starting the app.<br>  <br>  I also haven’t yet tried any line-level or high Z (guitar) signals into the iPod Touch.<br>  <br>  Others have used a video cable with much success by trimming off some of the plastic on the mini plug with a pocket knife and have a couple of adapters on the RCA plugs to use  headphones and plug in a mic with no problems. Having a mini 4- track is great fun to sketch out some ideas and with the upload feature it makes it great.<br>  <br>  As far as people being App negative it reminds me of showing people applications on the computer. I remember showing people Rebirth back in the day and people who were hardware centric calling it a “toy”. It was just a foreshadowing of things to come. Computers were a blank canvas that programmers created all kinds of music making tools that could have never been realized before. The iphone is a computer but it is also a new radically innovative blank canvas.<br>  <br>  iNoise with its nice interface and use of multi touch and axis to play the sounds is not a “toy”. I did a recent performance with it, during different pieces I used iDrum, Mini Synth, TTW, Synthpond and Bloom along with some other small gear like a Pandora and Stylephone. It worked well and sounded great. I was able to carry all my gear in my shoulder bag.|`|NznZENTqaa	This makes no sense...|`|7G8pvOPcaa	simple answer YOU CANT! do you see a mic on ur touch? NO so you cant
ed8e351d95ea3f9caab6cc8e923f7782aa	Close to the $200 range after rebates.<br>  <br>  It has to compete with the iPhone which is $200 for the 8GB.|`|cMmN6Do0aa	from what I read, it will cost around $249 with a 2 years contract, of course sprint hasn't come out with the real price yet, that's the rumors on a palm pre fans site <a href="http://www.PalmPreForum.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.PalmPreForum.org</a>|`|W7Y3ChsSaa	Well its going to be around the same price or less than the iphone. Im guessing that it should between $175 and $225. Especially in this kind of economy, a high priced phone will not sell good.
Ru3PBiAbaa	A good one for a low price but not a good camera just 2 MP but it has a good talktime of about 432 minutes but does not support WiFi.<br>  <br>  Though is a good phone.|`|w5KZdSSUaa	YES! got it todaay best phone eva!
DkA1jmbkaa	I have the same PSP and ordered a Blue LED Pandora Battery online from wholesale elite.  The battery is made for all FAT model PSPs and you can use it as a normal battery after the installation. The only PSP's not compatible with the LED Pandora Battery/Pandora Battery is the new newer model PSP 2001's and the PSP 3000. The website is www.wholesale-elite.com and the LED Pandora Battery is only 9.99usd
