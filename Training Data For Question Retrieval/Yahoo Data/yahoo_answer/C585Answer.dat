vVrvdSM6aa	insanity is a chemical imbalance of the brain.|`|5M0FBU89aa	There are many 'flavors' of insanity:    Medical:   you are skewed in one aspect in your answers to the MMPI?-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory?-2) - for one, but it's very popular with shrinks.    Legal:  You are a danger to yourself or others.    Regarding the MMPI:  it;s a test to see if you psychopathic, borderline, attachment-disordered, etc.   We ALL are a little (or a lot) of everything, but the big question that a shrink is able to tell is whether you are "psychopathic-by-nature", etc...     In other words, when a negative aspect of your life begins to "Dominate" your life, you start  moving into the realm of "mentally ill".      If you  cannot  function in society because of your mental illness, you start moving into the realm (if a court says so) of insanity-    "Catatonic" is just one thing - actually a symptom of either bi-polar or schizophrenia or severe depression.    Nowadays, If you commit a crime due to insanity, it does NOT necessarily  mean you get  off the charges - it just means you cannot be tried until you are deemed sane enough to stand trial.|`|B4diva6Qaa	Insanity is when you have to boil the orange sponge donkey across the phillipines with an orangutang gorilla crossed with a ham sandwich to the fourth power of twelve across the nile with an awful headache from the previous night when all of alfred's naughty jalapeno peppers frog-marched the nordic elves across the loom-lined geronimo induced swamp donkey over and above the fortran fortified kilomanjaro fence past the meticulously crafted anti disgusting sponge cake scenario where all the hats doth quoteth the milk which is not unlike the super werewolf from the infinite realm of ninja-step.  It's hard to define, really.

Btw, it is a good supplement for protein :)
BXwv4dBvaa	Okay, here's a guy's opinion based on sketchy knowledge, and I clearly haven't had experience with an IUD.    My first thought was the only weight loss you would have is the weight of the IUD itself -- why else would you lose weight?  Then I started thinking about the progestin that is also released by the IUD itself.    I think initially, this hormone may cause a weight gain when it is first inserted, as do the hormones associated with most other birth control methods.  You may have experienced this.    At most, my belief is that you may experience a rebound effect caused by the levels of this hormone dropping after removal.  One thing to keep in mind as well is that there will still be levels of progestin present for a couple weeks after the IUD removal, so it should taper off gradually and not affect your weight loss or gain significantly.
fAcVndo7aa	Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) is the most common abnormal heart rhythm.  It has to do with the way electrical impulses travel through the heart (I'm not going to get into the whole thing here, it's rather long and confusing to explain).  It has many different underlying causes.    Many people with A-fib live years without any complications, but there are increased health risks.  One major one is stroke - A-fib patients are at least 5x more likely to suffer one than people with no heart rhythm abnormalities.    Treatment may include anything from maintenance medications to surgery.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	it means your heart is spasming and not beating correctly.  paramedics use a defibrillator to shock your heart back into its normal rhythm.|`|CgwEfwOZaa	It's something to with an abnormal heart rhythm.  You should either check out wikipedia or google it.|`|db06833cd32d477373d0a2c38a077b60aa	Irregular heart rate.   It can be dangerous if left untreated because it can cause a stroke.   It can be managed very well with medication, usually a beta blocker like metoprolol to regulate the heart rate or a blood thinner such as coumadin to prevent clots.      For more information, check out http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Dise...|`|TORBP6QIaa	A-fib  is basically a rapid heartbeat...around 200bpm...it is treated firstly with drugs to try bring the rate back down to normal...if that does not work they can do other things but often the drugs fix it up.    (Ventricular fibrillation is the abnormal heart rhythm that needs the defibrillators to bring it back to normal.)
evmMYELsaa	Wow, I think it's time to see a doctor.  Try to eat even though you're not hungry.  I don't know what else is going on, here - are you taking some kind of drug or medication?  Are you undergoing any emotional stress (besides that induced by the lack of sleep/eating)?  There are important diagnostic questions that need asking.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	see a psychiatrist to feel better ,there is no shame|`|B4diva6Qaa	Get checked by a doctor.  A number of medical conditions can cause these symptoms: Thyroid problems or the manic phase of bipolar disorder.    Emotional problems, such as anxiety from stress can cause this too.
ffJfKTrHaa	This is a good start.  You can keep surfing the Web.  This thing is a definite time funnel!  You could look up something that interests you and maybe learn something new about it.  Plan a trip you'd like to take.  Balance your checkbook - that would keep anybody up these days!     Any other restrictions?  Can you still eat?  Maybe light exercise, TV.  Write a thank you note you've been meaning to write.  Drink something w/ caffeine.  Bathe the dog?  Look up some recipes for your favorite foods.    Good luck w/ the EEG.  And I hope you don't sleep tonight. (I think that's the first time in my life I ever wished that for someone!)  Take care.|`|YqdU6SS6aa	The internet would definitely be my best suggestion too! I totally lose time when I'm online!  And if you start feeling sleepy, either have some coffee, energy drink, or something with caffiene, if it's allowed. If not, or in addition to, go outside and walk around. I'm assuming it's probably cold where you are, especially in the middle of the night. That will help wake you up! Or if you live alone, you could always put on some tunes and jam out!! Hehe! That's always fun!! Plus it will get your blood flowing and wake you up!  Good luck!
kpi69PHWaa	The damage caused by smoking is cumulative. So even if you smoke only a few cigarettes a day or just a pack on Friday night when you go play pool, repeatedly doing so puts you right up there in the danger area.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	You should Google it .... it might be hard to find a study.  I'd like to know the answer since I'm a light smoker.    My logical guess would be that if you smoke a pack a day or more, then you have a good chance of lung cancer, but if you smoke like 5 cigarettes a day then you probably have a lower chance, but still a way higher chance than a nonsmoker.    Also, I know that if you quit smoking for 10 years, your chance of getting lung cancer is the same as anyone else in the general population who has never smoked.    Hopefully some people will post some links to some good studies.|`|LLmDQN7raa	It depends on how hard the person sucks on the cigarette.    Did you know sucking too hard on a cigarette can cause you to have a spontaneous orgasm?|`|AA10106538	just like having a little cancer
ETcBRko3aa	Usually they search your bags and let you keep:  clothes  socks  pillow  journals  ipods  some toiletries  Stuffed animals  pictures  books  Pretty much anything that you could not kill yourself with    Then they have a locker for you that will hold things like:  curling iron  razors  Anything that you could hurt yourself with    ETA:  No to laptops.  BUT, some hospitals already have computers set up.     (They need to have control over what you can view on the internet......)    ETA2:  No cell phones allowed in hospitals.  They usually have a hall phone that can be used when not in therapy or doing activities.      Well usually you have therapy a couple times a day in a big group.  Then you have arts and crafts, watch TV, play cards, read, talk to people, watch movies, EAT (I always gain like 5 pounds), sleep, meet with the doctors, meet with the social workers.  That's about it.  Usually there is also visitation 2 times a day when "outside people" can come and visit the people in the mental ward.    It is pretty relaxing.|`|2efaCROHaa	I think it depends on the place.  I know there is this one place where people had to take off their shoelaces.  Belts not allowed.  Very few toiletries toothbrush toothpaste clothes.  No cell phones or computers from what i recall.    I have been in a "fancy" mental hospital and a state run.  In the "fancy one we had walk therapy, played sports, played card games, ate really well, had AA meetings, group therapy, and watched movies.    In the state one..(pretty scary) we did art and I remmeber playing volleyball.  Mostly a whole lot of nothing at the state run hospital.    My goal is to never be in a hospital again
cooHcA5Kaa	Being short is not tragic, people don't die from being short (unless of course you have a form of dwarfism that has medical complication, but I am taking it you are just run of the mill short), is being short worth worrying about in the big picture? Would you want to befriend people who dislike you because of your height?  Rather than focusing on your height, focus on your stronger attributes, things you like do to.  As for dressing well - get things tailored or learn to sew.  This might sound stupid, but if you can watch Little People Big World on TLC (Matt, Zack and Amy are all very little yet all have huge personalities) or try looking at other short people who stand out in the world (Danny Strong is a great actor at 5 foot 2, Danny Devito is freaking amazing and is 5 foot 0, Martin Scorsese 5 foot 3, Ghandi, Honore de Balzac (his name also sounded like Ball Sack so try dealing with that),  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Joan of Arc... Height is just a number

adRaLmmGaa	A fever is your body's natural way of getting rid of bacteria and such. The rise in your body temperature kills them, kind of like cooking a chicken kills all the bacteria. A low fever can be left alone, although it may be uncomfortable. A higher fever may be a bit more dangerous as they can cause brain damage if they last too long. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids.|`|5AtpOkCFaa	monitior temp comfort patient.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	define fever.  it is generally a temp that is 102.9 and above.  treat with advil/tylenol, drink lotsa water, and see your doctor.
396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	I say if your friend can find a health insurance company to accept him then he absolutely should get that policy.  I have a feeling that most will do an oral swab looking for HIV, cocaine use and diabetes.  I have a feeling that he wont be able to get it.  Still, every large city has an AIDS service organization.  These organizations offer free case management and can get your friend into a free clinic and on a drug assistance program.  They will sometimes pay part of the premium for your health insurance.  You're right about the anonymous test.  Those test are not associated with anyone's name, only a number.  If your friend had gotten a confidential test the results would go to the Health Department for their surveillance and partner notification program.  Im pretty sure that the insurance company can get that info.  Good Luck to your friend...make sure your friend gets into medical care...its affordable anywhere and its the most effective way to manage HIV.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	When you apply for insurance, 99% of all companies will demand an HIV test before approving your insurance. The only way aroud this is to get insurance through your employer.    Besides, you sign a legal document promising disclosure of all pre-existing medical conditions. If they ever do find out (say thru prescriptions or anything), they can sue you for falsifying documents and demand reimbursment for any fees the incure, or any bills they pay for.     good luck|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	The way the health insurance agencies are, someone with HIV needs to be careful. If they ever found out about the previous test they would drop the person based off of some stupid reason. If you haven't watch Sicko, it kinda gives an idea of what the companies are like now-a-days.|`|CXRPHx8uaa	I would get insurance first without telling them about the test.  I actually did the same thing, but it wasn't for HIV.

HNDXF6DMaa	See a doctor ASAP.I felt the same way at your age but did nothing.Now I am 28 and just saw my doctor for this.He told me I probably have never or do not  know what it is to feel normal.Even if you do not want to go to a school councilor maybe there is a adult or teacher you trust who can help you.I feel like depression has held me back from enjoying all the things that life has to offer like friendships.|`|6nDqvtwbaa	Well I've had depression for a really long time but I"m still not exactly sure what to tell you.    I think you should not waste any more time being depressed.  Talk to your general family doctor that you are having problems with depression.  Taking anti-depressants for a little while may be be just the  thing to get you back on track and feeling like your old happy self.  Your doctor can prescribe them.  Most of the time they will do that without having to refer you to a specialist.    This is just one idea.  Also be sure to pray every day.|`|AA10918371	Hi there,     I know where you are coming from...because i am there myself. depression can be a horrible thing, that eats up everything in your life. from your social interactions, sleeping patterns, motivation...and your outlook in life. a feeling of absolute nothingness, where death seems to be a better option. right? but depression can be beaten...this can be overcome, if you are willing to hang in there and do the neccesary things to get your life back!!! THIS CAN BE BEATEN!!!!    like i said i know where you are coming from. so i'll share my story with you if you dont mind. you see, everything you described is exactly what i was feeling. I got help from a therapist, who eventually refered me to a psychiatrist after i tried to kill myself. she prescribed something to alleviate my dark mood aswell as something to help me sleep at night, to a point where things feels manageble at the moment...its a process, and not something that happens over night! i am still seeing my therapist at the moment, she has helped me to break down my work on a weekly basis that makes it more manageable, and that im not overwhelmed (you see i fell so far behind with my studies- that it felt like i would never catch up again). the structure she provides REALLY helps.    you mentioned that you dont want to go and see your school counsillor? Are you willing to make a start with someone else? i recently came across the following link, which indicates where you can get free help or at a very low rate. consider it!!! it really makes a difference.    http://www.healthcentral.com/depression/...    if you need to talka a bit more feel free to email me at melkmansekind@hotmail.com    good luck, HANG IN THERE!!!|`|qEvJyJboaa	Your situation is VERY similar to mine. I do understand exactly how you are feeling. It is hard trying to change your life when it seems everyone is holding you back in one form or another. I wish I had the answer of where to go or what to do. Just remember, once you do get to where you can be on your own never, EVER let anyone take that away from you! Stay independent! I had a great career, my life was going great. I left it to be with the woman I planned on getting married to. She is a top executive with a financial company, needless to say she makes more money than I probably ever will. Once I had left my career so she would not have to give up hers, she changed. She now had the power over me, I depended on her. I worked, but the job was just a job, not the career I once had. I tried to go back to school to earn a degree, she made the threat that if I did she was going to make me leave. She was on a power trip, what made it worse is that she was enjoying it highly! To make a long story short, I am back staying with my parents and trying everything and anything to find my independence again. She is still living the high life in West Palm Beach, Florida. I am living in the snow in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and have at least 2 more years of headaches and struggles due to giving up my independence for her. Keep fighting for yourself and your freedom. It's not an easy thing to do, always feeling like you are between a rock and a hard place with no escape in sight. I will be thinking of you. Maybe knowing that I am in the same situation as you may give you some more strength to keep going. I hope it does. Hugs are available any time. : )

Girls sometimes don't understand the lack of interest from the guy immediately after sex ... it's because ejaculating drains the male body of energy and sexual interest temporarily.  It also makes you sleepy as hell ... it's not just from the "exercise."  It's biological.    If you jack it, then you'll have a better chance of going to sleep.  Also, 9:30 is a little early anyway.      Tylenol can help along with lots of other stuff.  Melatonin can help ... Nyquil can help .... all stuff you take for sleeping is addictive in some way though.  You should try jacking it at like 10:30.  I bet it works.|`|56MmKc5caa	read a magazine or a book  watch a movie  listen to relaxing music  count sheep  excercise  watch the clear eyes guy his voice is so boring  it is better to do something if your tired rather then staring at the ceiling.|`|AA10639270	chamomile  tea -It tastes good|`|rQGyrGgRaa	I would just jerk off and have sex with yourself in till you are tried then I bet that it will help you fall a sleep  And try some night time pills that say they make You sleepy
mzl4sOKoaa	Do some oblique exercises. Those are like sit ups but target the love handles. However, It's better to use do fat burning exercises like running or swimming to actually decrease the fat, with a good diet of course. Abdominal exercises (crunches) strengthen the abdominal muscles, they do not burn tummy fat, and will only add definition if the person has a low percentage of body fat. However, by looking at the numbers, it seems that your somewhat of a victim of circumstance/genetics. Try some exercise anyway though. Even if it doesn't give you the visible results after a long period it was still good for you.     Good luck and best wishes.|`|TORBP6QIaa	I think what you are seeing is not really fat its more likely your skin is practically hanging off you.  If you put a bit of weight on and filled out some more your stomach issues would disappear and you would have nice rounded curves and every thing you eat wouldn't be immediately visible.  If you fill out the hollow spots in your figure your shape will improve.  I am sure your hip bones and collarbones stand out alot as it seems you have no fat covering at all so their is nowhere for anything to go but out...once you gain 10 or more pounds I reckon you will look alot better and healthier.|`|w1iHxDL1aa	Aerobics, try the hoola hoop|`|9z5YJKqLaa	exercising?|`|gVOesXA6aa	aerobics|`|174pexgPaa	Go running a couple times a week, or riding a bike is also GREAT, do situps every night to burn some of it off.

This is common with people who are anorexic, bulimic, or suffer from low self esteem.   2. How old are you? If your under 20 your body is still growing and changing.  Everybody goes through stages where their baby fat still shows, or their bodies just don't seem to be in proportion.  If you are a teenager this will go away.  3. Wear higher waisted pants.  Our bodies actually grow around what's restricting them no matter how skinny we are.  Like bra lines and waist lines.   4. You are not fat, you're not chunky, you're not even close.  5. Everybody's bodies are different. Some have big hips some have small hips etc.  You are going to live with your body for the rest of your life so you need to start befriending it.  6. Don't be insecure. That is a hard thing to do, but this is only a problem because you are making it a problem.  I guarantee you nobody else notices is nearly as much as you do.|`|mp43y1ZRaa	You honestly need to gain weight, not cause thats what everyone is telling you, because you probablly dont weight enough so the fat is hanging off of you. If you ate more protein and built up MORE MUSCLE (which in turn will make you weigh more) you will actually look skinnier. you'll remove fat and replace it with muscle. trust me about this. i used to be basically anorexic but once i started eating MORE...i lost weight. and toned up. and wasnt so flabby..

r9wrDGm2aa	Scars result from a wound or injury. Scars, however unwelcome, are part of the skin's normal healing process. Generally, superficial wounds heal without scarring. It is when the dermis is damaged that scars form on the skin.    Acne scars are most often the product of an inflamed lesion, such as a papule, pustule, or cyst. Inflamed blemishes occur when the follicle, or pore, becomes engorged with excess oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. The pore swells, causing a break in the follicle wall. If the rupture occurs near the skin's surface, the lesion is usually minor and heals quickly. More serious lesions arise when there is a deep break in the follicle wall. The infected material spills out into the dermis, and destroys healthy skin tissue.    Don't squeeze, pop, or pick at pimples. Squeezing a pimple can force debris deeper into the follicle, spread infection, and worsen a blemish. When you pick at the skin, it can cause acute inflammation and seriously damage the skin's tissue. Remind yourself that "popping" that pimple can extend the healing time and may cause a permanent scar. Allow the blemish to heal on its own.    See your doctor if you experience large, deep breakouts, or cysts. Deep nodules or cysts often leave deep, permanent scars as the infection destroys skin tissue. A doctor must treat acne of this severity. Quick, effective treatment can help lessen the chance of developing deep scars.    Dermabrasion  Dermabrasion is performed under local anesthesia at your dermatologist's office. A rapidly rotating wire brush abrades the top layers of the skin. After healing, the the look of scars has softened and pitted scars are reduced in depth. Dermabrasion is used to treat depressed boxcar scarring. This procedure may make ice pick scars look more prominent because while narrow at the skin's surface, they often widen near the base.    Once considered the gold standard in acne scar treatment, dermabrasion is used less often in favor of laser resurfacing techniques. It may cause pigmentation changes in darker skin tones.      Microdermabrasion  Not to be confused with dermabrasion, microdermabrasion is a cosmetic procedure that is performed at day spas as well as dermatologists' offices. During a microdermabrasion treatment, a machine is used to discharge ultra-fine aluminum oxide crystals through a tube and onto the skin. The crystals are simultaneously vacuumed away. A series of treatments is needed.    As only the surface skin cells are removed, microdermabrasion works best on hyperpigmentation. There may be slight improvement of the most superficial of acne scars.      Dermal Fillers  Another treatment option for depressed acne scars is the use of dermal fillers. A filler substance is injected into the acne scar, elevating the base of the scar so it is more even with the skin's surface. Results are not permanent, so treatment will need to be repeated after several months.    Substances used as dermal fillers include human and bovine collagen, hyaluronic acid, and fat transferred from the patient's own body. Your dermatologist will help you decide which filler will be most appropriate for you.      Steroid Treatments  Steroid treatments are often used for raised hypertrophic and keloid scars. Steroids may be injected directly into the scar tissue, causing the tissue to shrink or flatten, softening the scar tissue and improving the overall appearance. Corticosteroid creams and impregnated tapes (which are infused with a corticosteroid, applied over the scar and left on for several hours at a time) may also be used to treat hypertrophic scars.|`|wg3KFiVqaa	Use tea tree oil to help prevent and treat acne. Don't pick at them. Use sunscreen so as not to damage already sensitive open sores. Mederma to heal the ones you already have.

If you said yes to many of these symptoms you may have pink eye,which is an inflammation of the upper and lower eyelids.If you can feel a small bump on you eyelid,it will most likely be a sty.You must see the doctor if you think you have pink eye,a sty is a pain,but will go away on it's own,just don't bother it.I hope I have helped.:)

You should be excited to get it though! While it is a PAIN IN THE *** its also a mark of becoming a woman, and being able to create a new life!!  That being said, hiding pads can be hard if you get supers, but panty liners are pretty small. Tampons are even smaller (though be careful! Tampons can cause some girls a lot of problems with inserting.   However, you can use an old jewlery box, a pencil box, anything! Tape it to the back of a notebook and keep it for safe keeping. While you're period is nothing to be ashamed of, I understand what it's like to have it at a young age. You could even take the box from a deck of playing cards and stuff one in there.   You can't really KNOW when it will come, but when it does, its nice to have a spare panty liner.  Worst case scenario? If you find your panties bloody, tell a teacher you have a headache and ask the nurse. I garauntee she's stocked.|`|80BdMos5aa	No one cn predict when you will get it. Everyone is different. Don't be concereened untill you are 16 if you still haven't got it. Be glad you still haven't gotten it, it suck. TO hde you pads, buy a small make-up bag, an even smaller puch (like achang pouch) a couple new kinds of lip gloss, some lotion you like in a travel size, some kind of small pack of scented wipes (not baby wipes) and any other  makeup you wear in travel sizes. Get an extra pair of uderwear, the wipes, and two pads and put them in the change purse, put that in the makeup bag, and all the other products in the makeup bag,  and stash that in your backpack. No one will suspect a thing, and you will always be able to feel pretty. When it does come, clean up with the wipes, chane your underwear, and put the pads on. God luck honey
CZ1nO9C9aa	**** that's a good question.      I think your methods are good ... there can always be exceptions.    Sometimes when somebody ... a good friend ... is complaining and obsessing over something that's solvable, then you need to shake them.  Literally shake them and tell them to wake the hell up, and that everything is okay, and that they're just whining.  I think this is a responsible and caring thing to do.    So, sometimes the asker can think they are "asking for help" when really they are just "complaining."  In this case, you need to tell them to wake up and stop being irrational and stupid because their problem is solvable.  That's just my opinion though.  In our culture, people don't do this very often though they should.

JFo1tiaQaa	Playing in a band can be tough on your body- I mean it looks really "cool"when you do the whole head banging thing- but the day after has got to be painful. This motion of moving your head up and down rapidly can put a tremendous amount of stress on your head, neck and shoulders. Like whiplash multiple times in a session.  Okay I have some ideas for you-    1) I know you asked specifically for something besides a hot pack BUT- if you first use a moist heating pack on your neck and upper back, then slowly stretch your muscles, you may find some relief. Here are some good stretches for the neck: http://www.arc4life.com/site/615058/page...  Don't do these neck excercises to the point of pain, only to the point of feeling a stetch. Also don't forget to hold the stretch.     2) Use some type of icy hot, or bengay-an analgesic cream like this will give your sore muscles a lot of relief. I like to use biofreeze because it contains an ingredient called ILEX which penetrates deep into the muslce. Have someone else work on the muscles in your neck and upper back.    3) If you are going to continue playing in rock band, then I would suggest you get a chiropractor- Get a proper check up of your cervical spine. This will involve getting a consult, exam, and x-rays if necessary. The Dr will look at your posture, look for misalignments in your neck and upper back and do therapy on your muscles as needed (ice, heat, muscle work, traction, trigger point therapy) and help you improve your posture. Plus he/she can give you some good advice about you can still play in the band, without causing so much neck pain. At least if you are under the care of someone, you can play in your band and get some relief the next day.     4) Get a good pillow for sleeping at night. The last thing you want to do is sleep in an awkward position which will mess up your neck even more. Check out Arc 4 Life's Cervical Linear Traction Neck Pillow for a good support cervical pillow. Lots of good testimonials with this one.     5) Right after playing in your band, ice your neck and upper back immediately after. This will reduce injury, decrease inflammation and provide some immediatel pain relief.     Hope this helps you out and good luck !|`|AA11044288	by a neck buddy i think its call its like a u shaped  pillow you put in microwave that fits around the neck  better  then a pad it has flax seed in hit hope this helps|`|d67f3a2015e50ad7697c882e55b94a3daa	ive had that before...i say ice it, and let it rest.  you basically have to wait taht kind of stuff out, but it shouldnt last more than a day or two.|`|9fwDJ1GBaa	take a hot shower let the hot water beat on it, then massage it as good/deep as you can with a good lotion. take some ibuprofen :)
uQX1dchPaa	You have alot of thought and energy about this right now because you are looking for justice, understanding, healing and truth. So well done for standing up stating the truth and trying to help yourself through this. Unfortunately he may never admit it and that may well be just as hurtful as the things he did to you. It is also normal to have mixed feeling usually sexual perpetrators are people we are close too love and trust this confuses ther issue much because although he did those horrible things to you and betrayed your trust he is also your brother who you have shared a life with including happy memories - so yes you will feel conflicting feelings towards him - love and hate, closeness and betrayal. The best you can do is gain as much understanding as possible about how abusers work and the effect it has on the people they abuse - then things will make sense and this may be the best you can hope for. For a long time I felt like my own abuse ruined my life and the way I felt about myself. I am 34 now and my abuse occured when I was 7 now I hardly ever think about it any more and when I do I dont agonise over it anymore. In my teens like you I needed to be heard and I was bold and spoke out - that is good healthy and necessary. I really feel it is necessary to distance yourself from the abuser you dont need a constant reminder or the need to fake being ok around them. This is a long journey to recovery and not an easy one. Keep going to counselling, it is normal to go from okay to not ok every day is different but in time you will have more good days and less bad days if you keep progressing with your healing. Read about it, speak about it, never blame yourself, dont expect him to admit it, beieve in yourself, move forward with your life and I hope one day you will feel like me - that it just does not even define who you are anymore and does not need anymore thought anymore.|`|Gkf0dWYdaa	dont talk about it on yahoo...|`|lVNYRSs8aa	confront your brother, make him apologize about the things he has done|`|YUMqQZBzaa	Talk with your therapist about cognitive therapy. It feels a little hokey when you start out, but it can really help. You might never get a response from your brother that is satisfying. I had a similar incident in my childhood, and the family response is to pretend it never went on. Its very hard, and I'm sorry you are dealing with all that crap. Its not your fault.|`|EQydFhzmaa	It wasn't your fault. You need to work through your feelings in counseling just like you are, and  yes, it will take time. I wish you all the best.|`|9RajlJpRaa	i would try to write about how you feel and then show that to your therapist. definitely ask how to help get through the feelings. you need to remember it is not your fault, and you will be ok one day. time heals all wounds. just take it a day at a time and soon all your days will be good days where you feel strong. :) pray.|`|vpvITq2Daa	well im glad u r getting help cus that would of been my first advise. next u need to mack him feel guilty for what he has done. tell him how u felt about it when he was doing this to u and just to play with his mind tell him u liked it and have u told ur parents they should know about this if they don't know all ready. i for got to tell u be for u go jugging ur brother for what he did to u ask him why he did it. and have him get some help to betting him is not the answer to this problem.|`|AA12169920	Because as long as you "can't" get over it you have a convenient excuse to avoid anything that might be asked of you.|`|hmMb2oMOaa	I went through the same thing, although it was my father, not my brother, and lasted until I was twelve. And so I really know how hard it is. You're taught that your family is supposed to protect you and that you should show unconditional love. But he hurt you, and how can you love someone who has hurt you that bad?   Therapy helps, but as long as you are doing it right. You have to tell them everything about what happened. You have to relive it. And it will be hard, and it will hurt more than anything else you have ever felt. But after you hit rock bottom, and only then, will you be able to build yourself back up. Find support groups, meet people who have had something similar happen to them. Because, the truth is, it will always hurt, but you can make it better little by little by letting it go.  I, personally, found a lot of comfort in religion, but you can find comfort wherever you feel loved. And, you should really be put on antidepressants of some sort. You may be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, too. Ask your therapist for a psychological evaluation, as molestation can hurt you more than you know. It isn't uncommon for victims to develop schizophrenia from this. And all of this can be easily treated.  Remember that there is nothing wrong with you. And forgiveness was never made for the person who commit the crime, but for the person who the crime was against. This seems impossible now, but someday, years from now, you'll be able to look at your brother in the eyes and you will only feel pity towards him.  If you need anyone to talk to, you can always talk to me. I know that it hurts.|`|jtPt3UU1aa	its your brother that has the problem he needs to get over. he needs to get over his pigheadedness and apologize to you for the rest of his life|`|ZPYCus4xaa	let go of the past and think of the future.    it's hard to get over, but just don't think about it and it will be no more than a memory sooner or later.|`|f6307c174e9a08ef07d60d621dca0666aa	Tell your therapist how you feel.

4yzxXO1haa	Having low self-esteem and being good-looking are much less related than people think. There are so many people out there considered attractive by society who can't stand looking in the mirror, and there are people considered "ugly" who have no problems with themselves at all.  You should see a doctor if you are bulimic, cutting, or feeling depressed for any reason - not only are these things all bad for you, there may be some deeper issue going on.|`|5M0FBU89aa	Being beautiful is a great gift-  I had a huge head growing up. My  own mother told me she (and the OB) thought I  had Down's Syndrome.  I learned later that I had (mild) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, my mom smoked during pregnancy and took pills, including thalydamide (causes birth defects).    Count your blessings that you were never rejected by entire towns of people and teased and beat up for no reason other than you were what other people thought of as ugly.      If you want to be like everyone else, try just "dressing down" and wearing dowdier clothes and no makeup and a short haircut.     Believe me -  there's LOTS worse things in this world than being pretty.    Have a nice life    KC|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	It is morally irresponsible to throw away or wish away your gifts, talents, or natural self, whether you are religious or not.    You were made hot for a reason.    One way to use your hotness is to not be a ****.  Seriously.  Have high standards.  Get to know kids who aren't as popular or good looking as you are.

I don't know if that fits you, but it is something to look into.     I can sympathize with what you are feeling. It is horrible to get tons of attention for something you can't control, especially when peoples interest is so superficial. It seems as though no one can see who you really are.    Therapy is helpful, if only to have a place to talk about what you are feeling. I know all your friends tell you that you are pretty, but by doing so they are invalidating your feelings.    At some point in your life you may love how you look (as I hope everyone can reach that point), but right now you don't. And that's fine. Therapy becomes useful to sort out why you feel this way.    Cutting is a bad habit to start, it becomes addictive, and the scars don't go away.    I felt the same way; everyone would tell me I am so smart, and such a great guy, but I hated my life. It got to the point that I cut my face (I was on drugs). I have a scar I have to see every time I look in the mirror.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Self esteem/confidence is addressed in section 38, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris Some advice, and options: Volunteer, even from home, at first, to provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I... (insert activity here)..". Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated; there are many options; one is sure to suit you. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies.     Accept that you, too are just a human being, with the frailties, insecurities, and tendency to err, occasionally, that the rest of us have. That is the beginning of self love, self acceptance, and self esteem. Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation.     Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Make a list of all your good points, strengths, and achievements. Put it somewhere so you can easily refer to it, from time to time; perhaps on the refrigerator door, or print it; (large typeface, or capitalise) have it framed, and place in your bedroom, or in a position of prominence, such as on the television, or lounge room wall. Practise one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Section 53 at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/self confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself".     Read: "Lift your mood now." by John D Preston, Psy.D. 2001, New Harbinger Publications, Inc., 5674 Shattuck Avenue, Oakland. CA 94609   http://www.amazon.com/ may be worth trying for this, (you could also enter "self esteem" in their searchbar) because it approaches the building of self esteem using a different, but equally valid method.

Hopefully that helps.|`|S730dpLfaa	Kelly, if you're serious,read this blog before taking any action  http://finallyigotridofacne.wordpress.co...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to find the best teeth whitening method.  Hope this helps|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|d316bc276f0008283023ce68ab8384edaa	I don't know, but try looking into VANU juice.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Are you aware that only about 10% of women ever have a climax during sexual intercourse.  Orgasm for women is done during foreplay through external manipulation of the clitoris or through oral sex.  Don't be hard on yourself, I have been married many years and have never had orgasm during sex only before.  That way both of you get satisfied.    best wishes..|`|IFd94XDkaa	Not a lot of women can orgasm thru penetration, some will now and then but even for those that do don't that often - or at least not the me and my girlfriends that I've talked to over the years.  You'll need to start getting him to stimulate your clitoris and the orgasms will be hot and wild.  For guys penetration is so pleasurable that it's hard for them to understand that it's not the same for the girl.     If you don't already know, find out where you clitoris is and make sure your guy knows where it is too. He may not know what or where the clitoris is and you may have to be the one to educate him.  If he uses his fingers the best thing if for him to lubricate one or two first either with KY or some oil. Then he can start gently rubbing you.  At first he shouldnt rub right on your clitoris, just rub around it and as you become more stimulated go back and try gently touching it again.    Experiment and see what feels best to you.  Be sure to keep everything lubricated, dry isn't comfortable at all.  Obviously oral is a great way for him to bring you off as well.|`|YuH1olZCaa	You can try masturbating before having sex with him.

It may be some technique problems if you can climax on your own but not when  with him. Some women says they can never climax when have sexual intercourse.     Maybe instead of just doing the normal penetrating action, either you or he can stimulate your clitoris with fingers. Or maybe ask him to perform cunnillingus on you so that he could stimulate your clitoris using his tongue. Lots of women can climax just by stimulating the clitoris alone without any penetration into the vagina. There are some who can climax with sexual intercourse alone. But according to medical fact, professionals believe that although these women think they climax from vagina penetration alone without stimulating the clitoris, they are actually not. As if we see at the location of the clitoris, it is not just a nub between the inner labia like how most of us describe as, it does actually extend way back and it extends to both side of the vagina.     So, I am just wanting to point out the importance of the clitoris in the role of climax for a woman. Maybe, it will help more if you tell us if you can climax on your own when masturbating.

ParFJxnSaa	A previous answer follows: A selection of treatments follow: If you can't deal with it by using one of the techniques, such as counting backwards from 20, to 1, (and prevent yourself from making yourself angry, in the first place) is important to express that anger appropriately, at the time, and to the person who caused it, if possible, or immediately afterwards. If not, maybe by walking away later, and bellowing your rage and/or frustration. In some situations, such as work, or school, it might be better to cover your mouth with a cupped hand, bandanna/handkerchief, or use the crook of your elbow, to muffle the sound. Some people find that it helps to journal those thoughts, and emotions soon afterwards.     Anger, which is repressed, rather than healthily expressed, tends to fester, and later may cause explosive fits of rage, or depression. Let yourself feel the burning energy of that anger, and visualise it, as vividly as possible, as a hot flame cleansing you. It can help to have someone you can talk to. For more physically inclined people, a punching bag, or hitting your pillow, can be an effective release mechanism: visualise, as vividly as you can, that you are striking back at the cause of that anger. "But next time, when you get mad, just remember this quote: 'Those who anger you, conquer you.' It's basically saying that when you give someone the power to make you mad, or let it get to you, it's like they're controlling you.     When I realized that, it made me mad, so I try to control my anger and not let people see it. You can still control your anger without being walked all over. You just have to draw a line." Try saying to yourself, in your mind: "I am fire! I am ice!". Repeat for as long as it takes for you to calm down sufficiently. Anger management is addressed in much more detail than can be included here, in section 4, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris and practice daily, one of the relaxation methods in section 2, 2.c, 11, or 2.i Most people find the progressive muscular relaxation simple, and it can be done in several minutes. Others prefer to repeat a word, like "easy" in their minds, or a short phrase, and focusing your attention on your breath is another technique. You will know from the ease of use, and effect, which suits you best.    A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective. These will enable you to emotionally centre yourself, when practiced regularly. Yoga, and/or T'ai Chi may also help you become a calmer, more self controlled person, who is less influenced by the behaviour of others.

c26e39ebae3fd8fb31ce4def18eefae6aa	I'd like to share a little something.  I'm 16 years old and had acne for over 7 years. It seemed crazy to me that I was going to a dermatologist at the age of 9.  For 7 years, my mom and I searched for an acne treatment that was right for me. I tried everything you can imagine, from topical gels, to antibiotics, to even products I saw on t.v., like Murad and Proactive. Then my brother got introduced to Accutane. It worked wonders for him. It took me a very long time to finally decide Accutane was something I would try. The possible side affects scared me, but 9 years later, I was willing to try anything. Preparing for Accutane isn't easy. You must get a blood test every month as well as a pregnancy test. Your doctor will help you choose 2 forms of birth control, in case one fails. However, like I mentioned, anything to cure my acne would be amazing. After 7 years of moderate acne, I had no idea what my skin had actually looked like. I was starting to worry because I was in month 5, with only one month to go, and my acne still had work for improvement. Shockingly, right before I was to stop Accutane, my face seemed to clear right up. I still get a pimple here and there, usually right before my period, but it's very easy to cover up with a little make-up. I'm still told that my acne will not FULLY heal until about a year after I ended Accutane. It's almost been a year and I'm extremely happy with the results. My problem with other acne treatments, was that it would semi-work but then I would go off of them, and my acne would come right back. With Accutane, you don't have to worry about that. However, some people go on Accutane a second time because their acne starts to come back after about a year or so. The success rate is incredible. It's definitely worth it, especially if you've tried everything on the market. So speak with your dermatologist to determine if Accutane is right for you.|`|DKufXulOaa	This is a good question, and while i can't answer it personally, I'll be watching the answers.    Im considering taking it myself... however my parents think that the side effects may be too severe to take the risk. (right now im using tretinoin)    Although, with all the research I've done (again it's not personal experience :| ) But apparently in the first two months you break out like crazy because the accutane is causing everything to be pushed to the surface (and your acne actually worsens b4 it gets better !) but most people say in a six month period there acne cleared right up!

AA10768321	The normal resting adult heart beats regularly at an average rate of 60-100 times per minute, according to medicinenet.com. It depends on your age and cardiac health. The best way to determine your own "normal heart beat" is to rest for several minutes, then take your pulse for a minute (or take it for 10 seconds and multiply the results by 10 for a slightly less accurate measure). If you do this every day, you should be able to see that the numbers are similar every day. To reduce the variables, do it a certain period of time after you wake up, or after you eat (example, 1 hour after you eat breakfast).

gUyBXZYlaa	That's a lot of questions at once!    In a hospital if a person has a bunch of seizures they would probably use a sedative like ativan (sp?) to kind of "calm" the brain which would hopefully slow or stop the seizures.  For other things that could happen during a seizure (breathing stops, vomiting, etc) they would treat it the same way they would normally treat it.    As for how long a person would stay in the hospital, that would vary case to case.  If the person has never had seizures before they might do an EEG, MRI, or other tests while they are there.  If the person has had them before they may send them home as soon as the seizures have stopped and they know nothing else is wrong.

wnXyTiP9aa	Make sure you request to your mom that she hangs back.    First time I went to the gyno, when they finally called me out of the waiting room (it was a shared office for different doctors), I had to sit down next to my doctors secretary, and she asked me different questions before admitting me to the doctor. Most of them you don't have to worry about, but they will ask you 'Have you had sexual intercourse'    You might want to make sure your mom isn't around. Just incase! :)    Worst case, if your mom insists on being there and they ask you that question in front of her (I'm assuming you are young) and you HAVE had intercourse, just say that you haven't... but once you actually enter the doctors office for the examination, tell them you lied.    I think usually doctors will be a little more discrete and also sensitive to asking you stuff like that if they see your mom is right there.    Good luck

Good luck!|`|gbAML9gzaa	Nowadays you see all those weightloss programs like Weightwatchers coming out and saying that you can eat pizza hamburgers lasagna etc on the diets and still lose weight. And that is completely true. What you eat matters, but how much you eat is even more important.     You first need to find your basal metabolic rate.This is the number of calories your body uses per day to perform its basic, everyday, life sustaining functions such as maintaining liver and kidney function, keeping the heart beating, breathing, etc. Thats what you need to just stay alive. For me that's about 2000. I absolutely need that or I will feel weak and tired and eventually go into starvation mode b4 dying. Then if I'm Sedentary all day, like a desk job,go home ,sleep, I'll multiply my bmr times 1.2 (2000 * 1.2) If I'm lightly active (light exercise after work 1-3 times a week), then I multiply by 1.3. My number is about 1.3. So the amount of calories I need a day just to stay the same weight is 2600.(2000* 1.3).     There's 3500 calories in one pound of fat. There's 7 days in a week. So to lose one pound of fat in a week, you need to create a deficit of 500 calories a day in your body. So if I eat 2100 calories a day, for one week, I will lose one pound of fat.     http://www.freedomfly.net/Articles/Nutri...     http://walking.about.com/cs/calories/l/b...     I've always been a 'why' guy. I need to have a scientific explanation of why something works. And when I began to have weight problems I decided to check out the Internet. OMG. There are literally millions of different ways, means, websites, exercises, pills, teas, books, meditations, Techniques. I even saw a weightloss bubblegum. There's is one commonality in all of them though. And that is the caloric deficit, bmr, and exercise theory. And websites like calorieking.com make it easy. You can find how many calories is in a slice of pizza from pizza hut, dominoes, in a cut of bacon, a happy meal, anything! And I lost weight the healthy way.     There was a guy on National Geographic who ate less than he needs, did martial arts training 3-4 hours a day and was still 400 pounds overweight. They couldn't explain it. But they did find out that his brain had an imprinted mechanism that kept his weight at a preset level; like a thermometer on a thermostat. Genetic coding causes that. Who knows, he could've had Eskimos in his ancestry line. They do need the extra fat. And that code, which was dormant in the parent, could have been activated in him.     To me,there are people who are walking up on stairs. If they step up, they'll go up, step down, they'll go down, stand still they won't go anywhere. There are those on an up escalator. They don't even need to try and they go up. But it is a heck of a lot more difficult to go down. And there are those on the down escalator trying to go up. They need to keep moving just to stay in the same place. And they need some real, consistent, gut wrenching effort, just to move up two steps. But you know what, they all reach the top (eventually). Once there, and you step off that escalator, all the odds are now the same. Who would you say is in the best shape?     Good luck!|`|tB7GkTi5aa	Some of the best weight loss "products" are actually foods. High quality protein (meat, fish, eggs) for example not only increases satiety (decreases appetite so you eat less - without suffering) but actually appears to increase metabolism and help "burn" fat. Calcium also stimulates weight loss - particularly if you get your calcium from dairy products. (The specific amino acid combination in the whey portion of dairy seems to be responsible for this effect).    Other than that there are some prescription medications like Phentermine and Phen-Pro that help with appetite if you find hunger to be a problem.  I don't recommend  non-prescription products that are advertized as appetite suppressants because, for the most part, they don't seem to work.     As for supplements, there are also a handful  that MAY help with weight loss - like L-carnitine. Dont expect miracles from them though. They may help you lose an extra 4 or 5 pounds, but that's about all.   I discuss many of these, as well as good and bad foods for weight loss on my website if you are interested in more.

Every second person got a new product or something that works!   The best advice is to browse through YouTube videos and see what works for some people. Beware of the scams there as well.  Programs that work are mostly excises programs any thing that gets you active will work. Some names that you can look up are 12 week weight loss or 3 moths weight loss. And things like that.  There is a program P90x that is very good and it will work, if you are dedicated to lose weight it will work for you and if you are looking at diet pills and that kind of weight loss programs I will recommend Herbal Life.  And if you are skint and need some cheap alternatives that work well and you get like a free trail to test it see the resource link below.|`|fV2spk2Baa	The basics of weight loss are not as complicated as people make it out to be. You need to simply change your diet to healthy whole foods, fruits and veggies and get plenty of exercise.     This is hard to do for most of us because we are tempted with junk foods all the time.     If you want a structured diet plan that will tell you the types of food that you can eat and when you should eat them you can find diet plans that will do that at http://www.bestonlineweightloss.com    Good luck.|`|wRLa4KwNaa	When I was trying to lose weight after my third child, I used Acai Ultra Burn and lost over 40 lbs.

The main trick to weight loss is ofcourse that you eat healthy food and excersize not to much but ofcourse not to little. Me my self went through this package at the start i weight around 241lbs and now or 8 months from that i'm 198lbs i tryd alot of weight loss packages that i bought on the internet and yea some of them worked a little but when i started using Proactol i really started to loose weight i have only been excersizing 3-4 times a week for the past months eating healthy food but that product Proactol i really recommend. Ill give you a link to it if you do not mind you can read about it and see if you like it.

ahfzZ665aa	God i cant believe these people.....that guy claims hes a doc??? ARE YOU KIDDING?? Sorry you wouldnt still have blood comming out from the procedure a month later, and this time the resutls came back even worse? Wow...go get checked out asap...maybe go to a different doc. I cant belive the american health care system, it disgusts me, ******* idiots.|`|piI1aWOdaa	it would be unlikely to pregress that fast. its probably just the biopsy site bleeding a bit.. even if its progressed youve got it early and it will be very treatable...  um maybe Jessica needs to read your question.. you had a leep procedure and a biospy recently..not all 1 month ago.. and you are going to a doctor soon as you had a bx last week!.. I on the other hand am trying to reassure you that its probably not cancer
YzfHJFnxaa	If you put cover up on it, and then some compact powder that is your skin color it hides it pretty well.    Or you could just a comb and scratch against it, or leave a spoon in a freezer for an hour then when its cold you press it against it.|`|wg3KFiVqaa	Makeup|`|OsANQx7Yaa	LolI dint know people still get/give hickeys.I remember back when I used to comb my little bro neckloluse a combgood luck|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Ice.

Something you shouldn't mess around with. sometimes mom's are hard to talk to, but hey, she was your age at one time too.|`|KC6DKqs1aa	Have you searched on google or something?  I understand how you feel.  I don't think I could go to the doctor either because I'm private but if you think it might be from shaving it could be.  If they pop and go away I wouldn't worry about it unless you get a huge amount.  One here and there shouldn't be a big deal, kinda like a pimple.  This is my opinion anyway.
uttbqGB9aa	I know many answers will be the same BUT...GO TO THE DOC!    Even if it is something that appears insignificant. The body is a crazy and complex thing.    It could range from a piece of gravel that got lodged underneath the skin to a cyst that has formed between the joints. If you didn't cut yourself when you knelt or drew blood, it is unlikely that a peice of gravel is there, and this sounds more like a cyst, BUT to be sure go to the doctor, plus, if it is a cyst, the doctor has to drain it anyway.      Good luck, hope you get better. :)|`|5AtpOkCFaa	jeez if your just a young kid .tough it up.  If youre old tough it up.|`|P6CVElKkaa	probably got bit by something.

If he's not suffering, don't worry about it. The body has probably already grown around it with tissue, and accepted it like a normal bone.|`|aMkLPOOeaa	yes. my right hip, right knee, and more of my right leg has metal. been there since i had an auto accident and will remain there forever. lot of pain but doctor says it has to stay in.|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	My son has had a plate in his ankle for 20 years with no issues.
bwbWX85gaa	if you are trying to gain muscle this is totally wrong. Your muscle repairs its tissue and grows when you sleep, so you have to make sure you have enough evergy to provide muscle growth all night long. this means you should eat something that digests slow right before you go to bed, like oatmeal or cottage cheese. this way you get maximum muscle growth!|`|zwh9ELMIaa	About 2hours before bed, more if your dinner contains a lot of carbs.  To prevent catabolism (muscle loss) try eating some cottage cheese directly before bed.  The casein protein will digest and give your body enough energy throughout the night to prevent catabolism.|`|QEeZgoViaa	2hours before you go to sleep.
75Oa8Ni7aa	Many, if not most, protein powders have protein that was damaged and made slightly toxic.    Rather than lean meat, go for fatty meat.  Animal and other saturated fats are not the nasties they are made out to be.  High omega 6 oils and trans fats are the two baddies.  Just make sure your meat is from  healthy grass fed cattle (not feedlot finished).    Fats contain more than twice the calories per gram than proteins and carbs.  Fats help with the absorption of fat soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K.  Coconut oil is mostly medium chain fatty acids which help the immune system.    Make sure you chew your food to a liquid and swish your milk, juice, etc. around in your mouth to allow saliva, with its enzymes, to start digestion.    Eat some of your veggies raw for their enzymes which are destroyed by heat.    And some live, unpasteurized,  cultured/fermented food to your diet every day.    Proper digestion will reduce the number of calories and nutrients you need to eat as more of the calories and nutrients will be absorbed and assimilated.  Enzymes and probiotics also reduce the energy required to digest food, making more calories available elsewhere.|`|vwjeG8n7aa	Yes that will work,  Make sure you keep your eye on fiber intake as well.|`|bwbWX85gaa	i beleive this would be totally fine. as long as you get the 2000 calorie mark and its healthy food, should be fine.|`|ZnywY78Daa	Protein contains calories
a9iTYbrNaa	OMG!! i ahev the same but i HAVE had that ever since my FIRST period. It sucks balls!! theres not much you can do about it. Maybe just relax and take a nice hot bath that might work. (works for me:))|`|b22d33b389f66522a42da38105df85caaa	Sounds like a B Complex vitamin shortage. Seriously. When you have your period, your body needs extra B Vitamins such as FOLIC ACID. A shortage of the B Complex family of vitamins can cause all sorts of mood swings and cause havoc with your emotional well being. Go to your local health food store and talk to a nutritionist about this. Your doctor won't be too helpful since they aren't given a lot of information about vitamins and nutrition in medical school.    Also, most B Vitamins can't be absorbed simply by taking them like regular vitamins, swallowing them; they must dissolve under your tongue to get into your blood stream faster. When you go to the health food store, ask them if they have SUBLINGUAL VITAMIN B.    I predict that after you have been on the B Vitamins for a month, your whole outlook will change. In the meantime, try writing a nice letter to your Mom to apologize for your rotten moods. The nice thing about writing a letter is that that you can put down on paper what you are feeling without all the "drama" of being in a face-to-face conversation; you've already seen how that can be an explosive encounter. A letter can be more detailed and she won't be able to interrupt you as you are trying to make a point. And she can look over that letter once in a while to remind herself of your true feelings.  She knows you love her and you know she loves you, too.    Hope this helps. All will be well.
yOwRD4ZEaa	Naproxen is the generic term for aleve. It's an over the counter pain reliever that has absolutely no recreational value. In my opinion, it has no value as a pain reliever either.|`|evmMYELsaa	Perhaps.  But probably not without making your stomach bleed... That stuff is hard on the stomach as it is.|`|jQIfidI3aa	If you take 2 of the Norco it should give ya a real speedy high just     like if u took 2 Vicodin-    but for pain it is okay to take one of each though.|`|TRR69yataa	Norco - Yes (hell yes!!)

qHDkCC2Caa	dont worry about anything, you're fine! you're just scared cuz it was your first time, we all went through that! just remember to wash with soap down there everyday in the shower! and when he said you were the first girl to make him nut, yes, that means it was good. good job!|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	did you use a condom? If not, that could cause a smell. And you NEED to use a condom! Your own fluids will cause that smell too, so if you did use a condom its probably just your fluids. You just need to wash yourself after sex. Also, its important to pee after sex. This helps prevent a Urinary Tract Infection.     You dont need any products to stay clean. Just use a mild soap to clean yourself. Yes, orgasms are good, so if he had one it felt good. but no one is "good" their first time.     Please make sure that you always always always use a condom, and you should get on the pill if you  can. There is no such thing as "safe sex", just SAFER sex. Its never 100%. So use both.     be safe!
8OqdoIHtaa	Stick with the lowest carb one you can find, then you don't have to limit it. I use So Nice Organic, which has only about 3 carbs per cup. Once you get used to the organic, you will find the other ones too sweet.     The carb counts are per cup, (usually), check the serving size on the nutritional analysis.     You can add your own Splenda and vanilla extract if you want something different, or add some sugar free chocolate syrup for a treat occasionally.    I like to do a smoothy with a few strawberries and a bit of Splenda, which keeps the whole thing really low carb. Its a real treat, but I don't have it too often, as it could become addictive, LOL!      By the way, someone made an error. 3 graham crackers is not 1 carb. It might be one carb exchange, which equals 15 carbs,  but its not 1 carb.     http://www.thedailyplate.com/nutrition/s...|`|Lckon4W0aa	I think you should be fine :) As long as you don't over reach your carb limit, I'd say have at it! Everyone's body handles different kinds of carbs differently. In my case, my best friend is also type 2. For breakfast, I can usually get away with something decent like a few eggs, some sausage, and some milk or orange juice. My friend, on the other hand, can't have the orange juice at all because her body over reacts and her blood sugar skyrockets. If you haven't noticed a change in your overall blood sugar level after drinking the soy milk, it sounds to me like you'll be okay. If you do notice a change that you're uncomfortable with, just cut back to the lower carb milk. It's that easy! Congratulations on your control and finding something you can stand to have for a snack, btw ;-)|`|Oc0jea7Yaa	It should not be if you don`t eat more carb`s then you should, 3 graham cracker is 1 carb  and I don`t know about the soy milk. so if it in your carb count you will be fine.|`|iaYvC3Quaa	Hi,    I am reading a book called Dr. Barnard's Program for Reversing Diabetes, and they have good things to say about soy and almond milk.    You might want to try almond milk, I hear that it is good too.        Good Luck!|`|1wGJ0iziaa	Ehh, sorry but there is something in soymilk that can cause thyroid disorder.  Don't use this over milk.  It's so high in carbs and milk isn't stay away from soy.  I no i sound crazy telling you to stay away from something "good" for you, but if it makes you fat, i wouldn't take that chance...would you?
db06833cd32d477373d0a2c38a077b60aa	How about trying an antidepressant since many of them also reduce anxiety?      Since valium is so addicting and people quickly develop a tolerance for it, doctors are very hesitant to prescribe it.  They are more likely to prescribe other medications for anxiety and also recommend therapy to help with coping skills.    See a doctor, they can guide you in the right direction.|`|Sqp6HjtMaa	Just from my experience about doing presentations: Remember to always go first. I know this sound gutsy but everyone is nervous about theirs too and no one will remember the first one. And you'll feel the pressure if someone before you do really well and you don't think you can live up to it.|`|46DyqVceaa	If your anxiety is this bad I do think you should either go to your reg. Doctor (if you have one), but your best bet is to go to a shrink.  It's not as bad as you might think & you only have to speak about what you want too.  I know, I am the same way.  I paid $300 more dollars just to take a speech class on line rather than standing in front of a bunch a people glaring at me.  You don't have social anxiety disorder whoever wrote that because you never mentioned anything else about being overly afraid around people.  And taking an antidepressant is useless as well because they can take up to a month to work.  I take Xanax as needed & it works for me.  But you could try asking for Valium, Ativan, or Klonopin (they all work right away).  Hope I helped.|`|ARiPzGIkaa	Go to a psychiatrist.  They will most likely prescribe you benzodiazapenes (e.g. Ativan or another mild one), and diagnose you with social anxiety disorder.     Or you could get therapy and stop trying to take the easy way out.|`|1AWywas5aa	If your anxiety is THAT severe then seeing a psychiatrist if your best bet.        Or alcohol. :) It calms me!

It was not nothing (sorry for the double negative), it was something - something big. Don't let him tell you, or make you or your family believe anything other than the truth. About the question: Just go out and tell her. I really think you need counseling though and if that means you need to take your needs to a higher authority (such as a school counselor - in the case she doesn't believe you), than so be it. Counseling helps, and it should be given to you. You are a great, responsible woman for seeking the help you need - and deserve.|`|kZdyPspmaa	Sorry to hear about this.  I have two thoughts.      First is that you do need to talk to someone, you are on track there.  That's because it's tearing you up inside and you are hurting yourself.  Neither of those can be good for you.    Second that the problem of the family.  If you tell your mom and you get to therapy (which is the goal here) you must also keep in mind that all counselor's must disclose to law enforcement about the incidents.  So, in addition to getting yourself help you will also be opening a criminal case against your brother-in-law and while that may be necessary you will have to endure either your sister divorcing him or her never speaking to you again or splitting the family in some other way.  And you will have to endure a very long legal process in which you are the star witness.    One safe middle ground is to find a real trustworthy and mature person who you can talk to but who is not obliged to report (this varies State to State); that may be a minister of some kind but I'm not sure.    Hope all turns out well for you.|`|tSZMBTOIaa	You have to do this , keeping this bottled up inside you is going to interfere with any relationship you'll ever have now or in the future.I would seek outside help I would not tell your mother first sit down with an adult outside your family before you bring this up ,your right it might get ugly,dirty and a lot of mean things will be said.But honey, your the victim here not him or your mothers sister.You need to get the scum off the streets.

This is a big thing and you definitely need therapy, cutting yourself is a normal reaction to holding in this traumatic experience.    You are a very intelligent person for realizing you need to tell someone and that you need therapy.       It isn't your fault.  Tell your mom, you didn't do anything wrong.|`|ARiPzGIkaa	You NEED to tell her.  It is SO common for people who were sexually assaulted to keep it to themselves and even blame themselves, but this is hard for people who were not sexually assaulted to understand that.  Those feelings of guilt/doubt/etc., although seemingly real, are not true, and you have to realize that although you may feel bad, it is truly NOT your fault.  It never has been and it never will be your fault.  If she starts to doubt you or does not believe you, then I hate to say it, but she shouldn't have children.  Go to your school counselor if your mom gives you any trouble.  Your abuse needs attention, and you deserve all the help that you need.    Best of luck, and I hope that you address your feelings.  Think if this was one of your best friends or someone that you truly love and care about.  You'd want them to get help, wouldn't you?  Treat yourself with the same kindness.

I wish there was someone in my life when I was younger that i trusted so maybe i could have gotten help sooner.  I do hope you can talk to your mom about it so she can help you get some help and so that you won't feel so alone.  You are probably going to have to sit your mom down, when there's no one else around and just tell her, she's your mom and she loves you and i'm sure she only wants the best for you.  It's going to be hard, but you are going to feel so much better once you get it all out. I'm really glad you are trying to get help now, especially since you are acting out by cutting.  For me, it took years for me to deal with the situation and the things I went through as a child, and I did a lot of destructive things to try to 'cope' with it, sleeping around, drinking, not trusting men, fighting, any thing I could do to mask the pain I was feeling.  I did finally see a therapist, and really with the help of God, I am now not living in the pain I did as a child.  I really wish you the best, you can always email me and in whatever way I can help I will.  God Bless you, you are going to be ok, it may not seem like it now, but things are going to get better for you.|`|rbUXsgDBaa	you know your mom better than I do if you don't think you can tell her then tell someone you trust or if it helps have someone with you when you tell her. I strongly advise you to go to the Police what he did to you is illegal and it is not your fault you did not cause this!!!!!  It would help to know how old you are. If he is putting his hand down your pants and up your shirt i don't think you can be wrong.
PeCm21meaa	that's really healthy! i don't know about in japan, but here you'd actually be considered pretty thin! your boyfriend should support who you are and love your body the way it is, not be encouraging you to lose weight when you are at a healthy weight as it is.  you should talk to him about how it makes you feel and if he doesn't respond well, maybe you should find someone else.  love yourself for who you are!|`|M11E0MrCaa	YOUR NOT FAT, YOUR JUST CRAZY!    lol, seriously, you beautiful, and so skinny. Everyone in japan is super tiny anyways, dont compare yourself. Your boyfriend is ridicuoulas, and should be happy with the way your body is. Your gorgeous, stop worrying! :)|`|AA11086337	You're not fat, or even chubby.. I guess if you wanted you could work on some toning of muscles, but it's more about being fit than losing pounds.|`|11wcVc0Eaa	Lol is this a joke hun ur beautiful your not over weight one bit ...

I'd definitely do you and i'd totally brag about it later behind your back.|`|2aEU1lmpaa	Ok, first you need to dump that boyfriend ASAP!  What a creep!  At 6' you should weigh:    (small frame) 138-151 (medium frame) 148-162  (large frame) 158-179    Frame means how big are your bones.  Do you have skinny wrists, long lanky feet and hands?  That would be small frame.    Japanese are genetically small people so I'm sure you feel like a giant there, but you need to be with people who are supportive and like you for who you are.   Your bf sounds like a complete ******.|`|vsFF88tLaa	If when you exercise you run, then start to run father and harder each time.

You'll do fine, good-luck!! :)|`|f369129b856ec539d24f4afd1a3dd88faa	I looked at the picture. Where's the fat at, you look beautiful to me.

OuaUAAZlaa	youre probably grinding your teeth at night a lot. youre going to have to get a night-guard, if you dont have one.  if you dont have one, its best if you go to the dentist for one because they can mold one to fit your teeth correctly (minimizing any sensitiveness).|`|EQydFhzmaa	I would suggest getting a mouth piece that protects against grinding your teeth at night. It may help...? Good luck in your search for relief.|`|05aKFYl5aa	if you just go to the dentist, they'll give you a retainer to fix that. no need for braces.|`|etLfz702aa	you're going to have to see a dentist.  If you really don't want to, try making a jaw splint, by getting a mouth tray from a teeth bleaching kit, or a mouth guard from the sports section. If that doesn't work, a dentist is going to have to fit you with a splint for your jaw. Don't worry about braces, there are other fixes. I got my TMJ from having braces.|`|XQwaYEGraa	Go to the dentist and get fitted for a night guard. I was grinding my teeth very badly and was suffering from horrible headaches. I got fitted for two night guards: a thicker one to sleep with and a smaller one for during the day if I was really tense.     Within a few nights I felt a major difference. Also, if I forget to sleep with it I notice the next morning because my jaw tightens up. (though not as bad as before)     They do sell night guards in the pharmacy if you don't have dental insurance. If you do have insurance though I would suggest getting it custom made. It looks a lot like the invisalign braces they advertise on tv if you want to get a mental picture.|`|RAzV6v5Aaa	yes u prabably hav tmj, please dont be so upset!  i hav tmj and @ first i was completly terrified  but it rly is not so serious. i guess i got used to it ovr time so   i dident go 4 treatment- heres what u can do.    avoid hard foods, dont chew gum, massage your jaw,   get a night brace, take anti-inflamitory pills  or even have surgery    but please, dont feel so down i felt the same way when i started having symtoms.  im ok now, even thogh it did not improve.    the causes of tmj are stress and clenching ure jaw in ure sleep,  so i try to sleep with my jaw opened now.    and  i found a way to work around the cracking, u just hav 2 get used 2 pushing ure jaw slightly 2 the side wen u open it.    GOOD LUCK!!!|`|55xYyKOEaa	yea a retainer should really help|`|AkGQcZqQaa	you may have a problem with you jaw... you need to at least get it checked out if its bothering you that much..... don't worry... they wont do nothing like break your jaw or nothing... so only know they'll make it better.|`|SEVbfUyeaa	Sounds more like a jaw issue like maybe you dislocated it our something like that, but what throws me is that you don't have any pain in the jaw.  I'm also assuming you have been diagnosed with a jaw disorder however I never heard of TMJ?      My advice is this:   You need to get it fixed the sooner the better mainly because if you wait for ever the problem may become worse and you may actually start feeling pain.  However this is what I would suggest trying first  Rest your jaw joint.  try to get and use medicines for a short time, to reduce swelling or relax muscles.  Put either an ice pack or a warm, moist cloth on your jaw for 15 minutes several times a day if it makes your jaw feel better. Or you can switch back and forth between moist heat and cold. Gently open and close your mouth while you use the ice pack or heat. But don't use heat if your jaw is swollen. Use only ice until the swelling is gone.  Eat soft foods, and avoid chewy foods and chewing gum.|`|KquRdLiDaa	don't be scared, don't be nervous; i have it too; you need an osteopathic physician; the ones who do the traditional work can be found near you at cranialacademy.org or google or go to doctorhoang.com to look at photos of people with distorted clicking jaws, etc.  good luck.

It can also result in coma or death in extreme cases.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Nah..it's temporary.. I've gone weeks without sleep before and one night of good sleep cures it right away. 8 hours later it's like it never happened at all. At least that's been the case with me.|`|XzksQ3AFaa	Not getting enough REM sleep (the restorative type of sleep) definitely affects your mental processes. It makes your reaction times slower, "fogs up" your cognition so you can't think properly and make accurate judgments, and damages your ability to recall information. That's why it's better to get 8 hours of sleep the night before an exam, than to stay up all night cramming... if you don't get enough sleep, you won't remember all the info you crammed anyway.    Interestingly, if you've been awake for 72 straight hours, you are legally drunk. That is how important sleep is to your reaction time and cognitive ability.|`|5Ppc0Toaaa	So I guess staying up every night going to school online until 2 a.m. and waking up to a baby at 5 a.m. is doing me no good..   No wonder I feel funky|`|YqdU6SS6aa	Absolutely! Sleep is very important for your ability to function! You might as well be drunk or high if you have gone too long without sleep. If you are having trouble sleeping, then see your doctor, Or for less serious case,  take some over the counter sleep meds. Simply sleep works very well! It's Tylenol PM but without the Tylenol! Good luck!|`|evmMYELsaa	Absolutely.  I don't know about *permanent* mental damage, but eventually the brain could begin to turn psychotic.  As for losing the ability to think clearly... Well, that's totally common and can happen pretty quickly depending on the person.|`|gyZ0U7JTaa	I think it depends on why you're not getting enough sleep.  Are  you depressed.  Having to much fun or what.|`|8cf79148e562829978c35b0998c28a7eaa	suppose u can.....i mean ur mind hasn't rested, u will loose concentration and ability to perform ur daily tasks.....

ldpDzaolaa	This is quite unusual. I think you should see a dermatologist especially if you have that many and don't shave your legs. It might be something else. Have you tried Nair hair remover, then scrap it off after it sets? this sometimes gets closer to the hair follicle under the skin. If that doesn't work or it aggravates it, see a dermatologist.    There are black males that have a problem with their beards, shaving and ingrown hairs, might be a similar treatment or cause.  Could try soaking in the tub warm to hot water and shave underneath the water with a regular razor blade. What happens if you use and electric razor? I hope something helps you, other than that you would need an exfoliater and determine the cause if it comes back.|`|VTlilFu9aa	soak skin with warm water for a bit (a damp towel is fine)    then take tweezers and meticulously pull all the hairs out from under the skin. its annoying and you might need help but it works and as long as you pull really gently the skin wont break/ bleed    when you do shave always use a brand new razor and dont shave against the hair shave downwards and put lotion on after wards
vsFF88tLaa	the running is averaged about 100 calories/mile, so you'd burn 1500c /week by that. 3 good meals, (make sure to have healthy snacks in between) and lifting weights, well, that all depends on a lot of stuff. I'd say 1-2lbs/week. That's good, it's the maximum healthy weight loss. :)|`|AA11086337	Depends on a variety of things.. Age, weight, metabolism, time of day you exercise, what intensity, etc..

tS4t9Lndaa	.Your Dr is doing all the correct investigations to rule out any cardiac problems.Your Dr is investigating you to rule out Lown-Ganong-Levine Syndrome. It is a pre-excitation syndrome where you have an accessory pathway in you heart which can cause serious cardiac arrhythmia's.He ordered the echo to check for any structural abnormalities with your heart. He also may be sending you to a cardiac electrophysiologist to confirm this diagnosis. I'm not trying to scare you. If you have this it is quite treatable with medications or an ablation procedure. Diagnostic tests can be quite frightening but you have a good Dr. who is ordering all the correct tests. Yes it could also be normal finding and you will back running with your team. He is just being cautious. I hope all goes well with your tests. It's impossible not to worry. Take care,Donna.    EDIT: How did your echo go?|`|GMrtEYj6aa	Im sorry about your dad,but with a echocardiogram they could find more, don't worry,maybe is nothing big,but for you to run they need to search for more a lots of people don't go to the doctor and don't know that had problem with their heart and die running,don't be nervous,its better to be safe now and not sorry later.good luck.|`|ZiIPBQjEaa	No need to be nervous Layla, we kind of have the same history my dad died at 42 from a blood clot but he too had heart problems.  I've had more than few echo's since diagnosis of CHFin 99. I also have asthma that was diagnosed after 99. Anybody can have a serious heart prob and not know about it. You hear of athletes in prime condition that die suddenly every year during spring training. The impt thing is to get started early. Get a great doc. Relax. Take all meds. And relax. 9year ago they   gave me 6 months to live. That was a shock.  But great meds, and great docs will get you though.|`|TORBP6QIaa	You could well have uncovered the mystery surrounding your dads early passing away.  My dad also died young (38) and recently I was discovered to have a genetic heart defect and so do 2 of my sons.      An echo is a good test for you to have...and should enable the Cardioligist to determine if you need treatment or not.  You may have a heart valve abnormality like me which is totally fixable.      Keeping healthy is a great way for you to do all you can to avoid the same thing that happened to your dad.    Dont freak out, you dont even know what it is  yet and freaking out will just put your heart-rate and blood pressure up which isnt good for anyone....there is alot that can be done for heart patients nowadays and many live normal long lives.    Good Luck with your echo.|`|7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	These are all really good questions and concerns.  I would encourage you to make a list every time you think of one, and then talk with the cardiologist or your own doctor when the results come in.  You can also ask the xray techs doing the test but they may not be able to get very specific because they cannot diagnose you.    I wish you all the best.
2fZKpW9yaa	not all illnesses are accompanied by fever. if you feel sick and you're at school ask to go to the nurse and (as funny as it sounds) tell the nurse you are having explosive diarrhea.

iN6iidUwaa	Vancomycin is a safe option for patients with cellulitis that is resistant to other antibiotics.  The cellulitis is often caused by methacillin-resistant Staph aureus (MRSA.)  Vancomycin will kill 100 % of MRSA strains and is the drug of choice for resistent cellulitis that has failed cephalosporin antibiotics such as Keflex. There are a few emergent vancomycin resistant strains called vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) but the cellulitis is probably not one of those strains.  Usually vancomycin trough levels are drawn to make sure patients aren't getting toxic on the drug.  A typical trough level to treat cellulitis is between 15-20 mcg/ml.  The literature reports that trough levels of 8-10 mcg/ml are normal.  However, higher trough levels are needed for cellulitis to ensure that the dose is high enough for penetration and distribution into the skin tissue.  Peak levels are not routinely drawn for vancomycin as long as the dose is adequate. A typical peak level would be between 30 and 40 mcg/ml.  The usual starting dose for vancomycin is 15 mg/kg rounded to the nearest 250 mg.  So, 1 gram is sufficient for patients of average weight of 60-80 kg.  The interval of 12 hours is a good interval to start.  If the trough levels come back high, then the interval is extended to 18 or 24 hours.  The trough level is usually drawn with the 3rd or 4th dose. Unless there is some renal impairment, the 12 hour interval is usually used.  For young patients or for treating meningitis, 8 hour intervals are used to maintain higher blood levels and target trough levels are usually 20 mcg/ml.    As far as duration goes, 10 days is typically the timeframe for treating cellulitis.  Severe cases may require longer duration.  I have seen patients on it for 21 days for cellulitis, 6 weeks for endocarditis and 8-10 weeks for osteomyelitis.  So, the drug is very safe if dosed properly and levels are monitored about once a week after any initial dosage adjustments.  Vancomycin is not absorbed orally and is used orally for Clostridium diff. infections of the bowel like bacterial enterocolitis.  So, there should be no stomach upset as mentioned by the other person because vancomycin would NEVER be used orally for cellulitis.|`|kA0xb0MVaa	Safe is relative.  If your cellulitis did not respond to the keflex, then one of the myacins are your best option.  Having said that it is really hard drug for your body to break down properly.  Extremely healthy people have a great deal of problems with this drug.  And the dose is high.  I would have other questions, before giving you a more definative answer.  Good luck.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	10 days is long, but I have seen it done (usually for MRSA patients)    so yeah, if this is for a project I would double check in your book for the dosing for recurring cellulitis though. For extreme MRSA it is OK, even then its usually a shorter length.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	it's safe but could cause a bit of stomach upset.|`|mAp90hEeaa	If that is what the doctor ordered, that is what you need to do in order to clear this up.  Vancomycin is used when all other drugs fail.  And, there are usually blood tests that are done during the course of the antibiotic.|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Your cellulitis must be bad.  Every medication has risks.  I've never treated cellulitis with Vanco, it's usually flucloxacillin. Some people do require 10 days worth.

From the experience I've had with my youngest daughter, if her symptoms are still that noticeable chances are she is net yet on the right meds. you might let her know that you want to be educated and go to her Dr with her , you can tell them what you are seeing. she may not be able to see it for herself. Good luck|`|Q6ig8k7Xaa	If she is having major mood swings then she is obviously not properly medicated. You should suggest she speak to her prescriber about this.    I would suggest therapy for her as well.    Mainly though, you have to take care of yourself. You cannot fix her or save her.   She will always have a mood disorder. This does not mean she has a blanket pass to treat you badly.    You have to tell her how her actions make you feel. If she gets more depressed or acts out, that is not your responsibility.

XhrAjcilaa	... the caffeine is not going to "cancel out" the xanax. It would interact with your body independently, most likely giving you a little jolt,l as I see has already happened.|`|83StA1rKaa	Yea you should be fine, but you could always just take half and be careful|`|yOwRD4ZEaa	The caffeine will just cancel out the xanax. Honestly, your doctor shouldn't have you taking xanax every day to begin with. The xanax should only be taken as needed when you are having a panic attack. An SSRI such as zoloft or paxil is much more commonly used as a daily medication for anxiety and will not make you so tired.     The lowest possible effective dose of xanax should be given. Frequent use will cause you to build up a tolerance. If you're getting really tired from it, your dose is probably way to high. Try cutting your pills in half or even quarters and see if they are still effective without the lethargy.
Vj13f7zmaa	I suffered for six yrs so I know what you are going through.  I had one panic attack as a teen, and it didn't come back until I was 30, but then it got me really bad and didn't let up even a day for six yrs.  Soooo... the fact you already know it is a panic attack is going to make it much easier for you.  First things first though.. panic attacks do not shorten your life or cause any kind of heart problems.  You can research me on this, and you will find I am being accurate.  The reason that panic attacks like what I had, that went on and on for years, happen.. is because of exactly what you are worrying about.. You have one, you worry you will have another, which sets off another.  However, if you understand what they are then you can prevent them from taking over.  you may feel out of it and weird for a little while, but there is no reason to fear the attacks.  Unlike what some Drs. will tell you, there is no need for meds and you can come out the other side completely and totally well.  Read "Panic to Power" by Lucinda Bassett and you will feel much better!|`|Tl40qXrzaa	I don't think that means that it will definitely come back; but it's likely I assume.   I just started getting mild ones last year. I  thought it was just allergies or something, because it only caused me to have a hard time breathing. The doc gave me a low dose Xanax prescrip and that did the trick. I took a pill whenever I had one. After like 3 episodes I was all good; hadn't had one in months.   Just this week though they reappeared. I had the worst one the other day. I was bugging out! I kept telling myself that nothing was wrong, that my mind was playing tricks on me, but it didn't work! I tried to get over it without the prescrip, but it wasn't happening (I suppose if I waited longer it would have but I couldn't deal). Took the pill and was fine 20 minutes later.     I can't afford therapy, and I only get them at home, at night, so I'm going to look into meditation or something. Maybe I'll pick up that book that was mentioned.     Good luck|`|RfFDEJLlaa	yes you will i been like this for almost a year now i bought the linden method i just started so i don't know if it works yet , hope you find a solution soon and your not alone there is millions of ppl just like us be strong and remember that what your feeling wont hurt you is just the anxiety wish you the best.
fAcVndo7aa	Swelling in your throat that is making it hard to breathe is nothing to play around with.  You didn't say if it came on suddenly, or if it's had a slow onset, but I wouldn't take any chances.  It could be some kind of infection, if it came on slowly.  If it just suddenly happened, that could be a serious allergic reaction.  If an allergic reaction like this is left untreated, your airway could swell entirely shut.    If you're having difficulty breathing, you need to see a doctor, either way.  I don't care what time it is.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Might be an allergy.  Try taking some antihistamine tables.  If its not better in the morning, see a doctor because it may be strep.      Is your throat red?  Tonsils got white spots on them?  Fever?  Pain?  Infection is a real possibility.  Irritation from coughing and excessive nasal drainage can be a factor too.|`|4BoteYDwaa	It sounds like your allergic to something. Take an anti-histamine. If you don't have an allergy to bananas, they can actually help with some allergies, or a spoonful of honey.|`|b6e8a23e8ce0872697abf94a37d4524caa	It could be an allergic reaction to food or something.

FfBll2n8aa	A good friend of mine has recently battled breast cancer, and I've become very well informed as a result.  Re the leakage, that is very closely linked to hormones. If it's coming out of both breasts, it's very unlikely that it would be caused by cancer, as you are very unlikely to have it in both breasts at the same time, causing the same symptoms. From what i've read, normally a discharge caused by cancer will be a fairly late stage symptom, and you would have very obvious masses within the breast before it happened, except in extremely rare cases. The is a type of cancer that can specifically cause discharge, but it is extremely rare and of course only normally effects one breast.  I think your best bet, since there is a history, is to have regular exams by a specialist. Generally, when you're young, your breast tissue is too dense for mammograms to be effective, so it's a matter of being examined manually by a specialist, as well as doing your own regular exams.  Next time you see your doctor, ask about the discharge. I'm confident it won't be anything serious.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	i dont know what kind of medicine or hormones you are taking, so im not sure if that could be causing the leaking. i know if its birth control that wont happen. is the fluid clear? go get checked because that is a symptom of breast cancer.

ETcBRko3aa	Wow!  Awesome.  I take Seroquel too and went from 800 mg to 400 mg.  I am trying to get off too because I have gained weight.  I have been on it for 10 years.    I suggest going down by 25 mg now.  So, take 75 mg for 2 weeks, 50 mg for another 2 weeks, and then 25 mg for awhile.  Let your body get used to the decrease.    My shrink said that after you are off it, you might feel dizzy for a couple of weeks and may not feel hungry.  But it will take about 2-3 weeks to get used to being off it.|`|UIpobEThaa	I was only on it for 6 months, so I had no problem getting off it.  I loved it, but I gained 20lbs.

sHYx1Jpfaa	I've herd there is a oil out there called "Bio Oil" that works well with scars i think you can get it from your local Chemist or Supermarket i'm not sure, make sure you see a GP before using it. could cause some reactions. but i herd its really good for scars and healing.

jxKQqbC9aa	call Liberty Mutual today I know Wilford Brimley would want u to!!!|`|agR89OPtaa	Yes, I am a borderline diabetic.  Sometimes my a1c comes back fine then it comes back bad.  If I am not conscious of the carbs I consume, and don't exercise daily then my blood test is bad.  All my brothers and sister are diabetic so I am in danger of becoming one.  I really don't want that.|`|pJ7icz0taa	If everything came back fine then you should be OK..I am a diabetic and believe me if you were a diabetic you would know  Thirst that you can't satisfy  Tired all the time  Not feeling active  The thirst is the bummer.|`|Oc0jea7Yaa	Did they do a A1c on the panel, If not that is what you need to find out if you are or not diabetic.|`|0Pv2jt8faa	That would depend on the nature of your symptoms and what exactly is amiss. If it is frequent urination then I'd suggest going in for a routine checkup with the doctor and doing the whole "peeing into a cup" deal. If it's the eyes then unless colors are HURTING them then I wouldn't worry about occasional blurry vision and just say that you need more sleep/less stress. Tingling sensations are hit and miss- I get them sometimes when I use my wrists/arms a lot during the day or poor circulation when you sleep.     If you are inquiring about sugar-symptoms then it's a bit more simple.    If you are over your limit then you should feel very uncomfortable, and moments away from passing out. If you are UNDER your limit (which is VERY common with all kinds of people of all shapes and sizes and walks of life) then you should be feeling light-headed, nauseated, sleepy, intensely hungry, and overall just weak. Eat something sweet and that will usually revive you.    However, like I said, I don't know your specific symptoms so I can't really tell you much, however, if your blood test came out in the green then I wouldn't worry about it. The human body does odd things and can play tricks on you- even more when you become afraid of a disease. I'd say to take a week off from the internet (or at least the weekend) and try to just go along as you normally would. If the symptoms persist (even without the online research to fan the flames of your worries) then go and see a doctor for a second opinion and just state clearly that you still "feel" like something is wrong.

Even if you are a bit overweight, at that height/weight you certainly aren't "disgusting".|`|WodlreGLaa	No i think that would be pretty average for u height.|`|WsFD3EQIaa	no your not overweight...and dont feel disgusting around your friends....your actually around where your supposed to be and your friends may be underweight or be shorter.
tI1NHwfBaa	Yes, you are probably having a panic attack.      I was as healthy as a horse until someone I knew nearly died of a heart attack, and I got to feeling the same way you are.    A panic attack is a diagnosis of exclusion, however, which means that you can only be found to have a panic attack if you have no other general medical condition that can produce the same symptoms.    It might help to know that a heart attack doesn't linger.  It's usually over in less than 15 minutes.  If you get up and move around and hurt worse, I'd take it easy and call an ambulance.  Otherwise, follow up with your doctor.|`|uuHDQr1paa	How old are you?

The possibility of you have heart attack symptoms is miniscule.  Much more likely is that the fear or anxiety over a heart attack is bringing on the physical symptoms of a panic attack.    Symptoms include:  - lightheadedness  - dizzyness  - a pounding heartbeat  - numbness in the extremities  - utter panic and fear that you're dying  - hyperventilation  - shortness of breath    Yes, you were having a panic attack.

They are: Panic Away and The Linden Method.    You may wonder, "Which one is better?"  Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.    The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.

I randomly chose amounts for the sections, they're never the same twice, and do it over and over again for a fe minutes, it really works for me. :)
N7xKowJYaa	i don't think so.  in the commercial for herpes medicine they are always swimming or kayaking or otherwise froliking about in what appears to be our municipal water supply.  so i don't think you can catch it that way.  plus a swimming pool has enough chlorine to kill like, a person, maybe you, probably so i wouldn't worry about herpes.  and you can only die of herpes if you are a baby or you have aids, so just relax!!! age 13 is the last time you can truly relax until age 100.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	You can't die from herpes... but I dunno if you can get it through swimming. Good question lol|`|UZxeBrxQaa	No you can't get herpes because the chlorine in the water would kill the virus.    Herpes is a contact disease.  It has no cure, but can be controlled with antiviral meds.    It won't kill you.  Relax, you are just fine.|`|6qPndPvXaa	um no and no...herpes is skin contact..you can get it by sitting on a toilet that someone just sat on but it would have to be right after...I know this because a friend got it on the back of his legs that I know...anyway the pool chlorine kills it..and as for dying..no not unless you have it all over your body and in your heart and everything and I have never ever seen that ...just be careful and let that be a lesson to you to always use protected sex..or even better abstain until marriage.|`|BBVfRheyaa	You will never die by herpes.|`|fk9AvB25aa	No you can't get herpes from swimming in the same pool that some one with herpes did. You could be sensitive to chlorine down there which could by why the water was stinging you. Herpes does not survive in water or away from the body for more then seconds.  You can't get herpes just by shaking hands, or just touching her on say her back or arms,   To pass herpes on you need skin to skin contact with an out break. your mouth or genitals needs to have some contact with a herpes out break. For example if your friend had an out break of cold sores and gave you oral sex or if they had an out break on their genitals and you had regular sex. By the way herpes won't die of herpes but it is some thing you will have for life.|`|DXdMMrAcaa	No. You can't get herpes that way.  If your genitals contacted then yes.  But if you are in a pool, or a lake, you can not get it. Your penis was just reacting the the temperature change.  You can not die from herpes. Stop worrying! You are fine!  Remember though that in the future any oral/genital contact with somebody who has herpes is dangerous, and the best way to be safe is by using a condom.|`|AA11840819	No it takes actual sexual contact to get herpes.  The person you get it from has to be in a herpes outbreak for you to catch it when you do have sex.  Most people who have herpes do not know they do until they have an outbreak of the sores.  It can be treated with medication but you cannot be cured. It is the same virus but a different strain that causes a fever blister. No you cannot die from herpes.|`|wscyjkPAaa	You can't catch herpes like that.  it needs skin to skin contact for it to be transmitted.  And you can't die from herpes, although you would probably wish you did during a breakout.  You have nothing to worry about.  I think that pain is psychological.|`|IgXivJJcaa	Hello:)  I hope I can help answer your question.  Herpes is only spread by intimate skin to skin contact. Herpes is an STD. It is NOT spread by toilet seats, swimming pools, or shaking hands. The symptoms are redness, itching, bumps or blister like sores and other problems that you can look up on Valtrex.com Their website even says that you cannot get herpes from a swimming pool. I hope you fell better when you research their website!
IFd94XDkaa	The doctor will put a thing in your vagina that he then opens up.  It's sort of like a shoe stretcher and it's fairly uncomfortable but not painful.  Then they take a wooden tounge depressor thing and put it inside your vagina and scrape it along the side to get a cell sample.  Also, not comfortable but not painful.  It's not fun but I'd rather do that than go to the dentist by a long shot.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	a pap smear is a swab of cells done ,,, then they send off to a lab, to best tested,looking for cancer , infections|`|94EGAGmUaa	Just your vaginal canal and cervix opening.

7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	You'll see some initial weight loss but when your body realizes that it is not getting as much fuel, it will go into hibernation mode, and will actually start converting muscle to fat.  This is a throwback to primitive times when food became scarce.    You are far better off eating a balanced diet, one that gives you a healthy mix of proteins, lean carbs (fruits and veggies) and some starchy carbs (breads, pasta, potatoes, corn).|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	Of course you'd lose weight, but you'd be lacking in nutrients.

Also it makes you pee a lot.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	V8 does not come close to whole fruits and vegetables, and fresh sqeezed juice, and home prepared fruit smoothies nutrition wise. It doesn't taste good either. Eat raw fruit,steamed veggies,and whole grains. Ditch milk, FYI a cow's milk is meant to grow a 90-pound newborn calf into a 800 pound cow within a few months. Drink chocolate soy milk. You'lle get used to the taste and eventually will prefer it over cow milk.|`|nN8D64Yzaa	please stop and think about what you're trying to do here.  drinking only v8 for two months will no doubt make you lose weight. perhaps a lot of it.  but it is so unhealthy because you will be so deprived of things your body naturally needs to run on, and overloaded with the nutrients in v8 drinks (depending on how many you plan on drinking...)  once you start eating healthy again, the weight will come right back because you have made such a drastic shift in weight, and you might even gain a few pounds because your body probably thinks its being starved.  in the end, you will have 2 months of unnecessary suffering to lose a few pounds and then gain it all back. and your metabolism will pay the price.     i urge you to think of more rational choices for weight loss. a healthy diet, lots of water (3 liters a day), and about 30-60 minutes of extra exercise a day will help you lose weight in the long run and stay happy. and contact your doctor if you plan on making any big diet changes, please.     good luck with everything!|`|YGwvoUPTaa	i think you will die|`|AA11086337	I don't think this would be nutritionally sound.. also you'd be lacking things such as protein, fiber.. not to mention your digestive tract isn't meant to live on just juice.|`|zwh9ELMIaa	You'll lose muscle mostly.

uC75y83Taa	ELAVIL is the med for you. If it was just anxiety I would say Klonopin. That's a miracle drug for anxiety. It might help you for insomnia too. Talk to your doctor about it.  Make sure your doctor knows what s/he is talking about.  When it comes to anxiety and insomnia, psychiatrists are the very best doctors.  They go to school an extra 4 years, and they come up with meds that no regular doc would even think of.  Keep that in mind. You can even ask your doctor if you should see a psychiatrist.  S/He might say, GREAT IDEA!!!  If you're bouncing off the walls, you need to make a change.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

In between each vertabrae there is a disc that can be damaged when like lifting something heavy and even worse sudden movement (like when you've been jerked in a carwreck).

6SB4ufEYaa	For depression, you just need to change your outlook. Life is what you make it. Almost everything in life is changeable. Change what you can, and accept that what can't be changed is that way for a reason.    You can have a great life if you choose to.    For anxiety.. close your eyes. Focus on your breathing. Listen to relaxing music. And then face your fear head on. Never give in to it.

Get the proper help.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment).     It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor.     (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see http://www.mercola.com/ SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, dont follow the typical normal reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that youre looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements.     (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*. (5.) Initially, at least, some form of counselling, preferably either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).     If 5HTP is used to boost serotonin levels, (which are low in depressed people) it is best taken with a high carbohydrate, minimal protein meal, like pasta, with tomato & basil, and avoid protein for 90 minutes, before, and after, to maximise the amount crossing the blood/brain barrier. 80% of people in the Western world have low magnesium levels, and these are known to cause depression & anxiety.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	The only way I deal with it instead of going to the hospital is to find a quiet place and close my eyes, take a deep breathe and exhale slowly a few times then everything seems so much better.|`|rbUXsgDBaa	first you need to get a diagnosis, then be treated for the appropriate illness
mp43y1ZRaa	I'm a health nut and to me, your diet sounds extrememely resonable. You can even swtich it up like having egg whites for breakfast instead, or oatmeal. Both very healthy and low calorie. Bad signs of dieting would be irregular "bathroom" movements, faiting, dizzy, tunnel vision, not HAVING to go to the bathroom or not being able to concentrate. But your diet really doesnt sound like your anywhere near this. 1500 calories and that level of exervise is very smart.

Ob9AZnA4aa	I hate running too and use sports as a way to get my cardio. I'll usually lift and then go play basketball or football to get a run in. Lifting with cause a spike in your metabolism (post-workout mostly)- coupling this with a good cardio workout would scorch calories (especially in the areas where you just lifted).     Another tip for running would just to run intervals. You would think running full speed for 10 minutes would be better for jogging at a medium pace for 20 or 30 right? Well try doing 45-60 second sprints with different rest times between each set. First, rest for the amount of time you ran. The more you progress either lower the rest time or increase the sprint distance (or even sprint up hills). I find I get my cardio done in 15-20 minutes rather than 30-45 and feel faster (different type of muscle workout), stronger, and get more cut.    Obviously you need to be running some long distance since you want to join the forces so I say get that in at least once a week. Nothing is compared to interval training though (for increasing oxygen intake to your lungs) so do that twice a week since some lifting and resistance exercises (push-ups, pull-ups, and ab work) should be done. Last thing- get plenty of sleep to repair your body and mind.|`|9XmJPjXvaa	check the required calorie you should take to lose weight with the Calorie Guidance Estimator here  http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com/    then decide whether you need to lose weight. if you do get a full access to the best diets program, community, and resources for free for 30 days only.  they also have other programs that you should check out.|`|ZJCoUMijaa	that is a perfectly healthy weight.. no need to lose any

jQkFpGJHaa	It could be that you are just working your chest incorrectly. For instance, if your chest is not sore in the next day or two after working it, you probably are either working it incorrectly or not enough. However, since you say you've been hitting the gym for a while, it's most likely that your chest naturally doesn't look as big in proportion to, say your back. I got a friend who's close in height to me, but he is 220 pounds (steroids) of muscle, where I'm barely 170, but my chest looks bigger. It's probably just your genetics.    Here's a good chest workout, if you need one:  Flat Bench for 3 sets of about 12 reps  Incline Bench- 3 sets of about 12 reps  Decline Bench- 3 sets of about 12 reps  Chest Dips- 3 sets til failure  Fly's (dumbells or machine)- 3 sets of about 12 reps  Right after your last set on the weighted exercises, it's good to even rep it out (up to maybe 15 reps) on a lower, easier weight. You will feel the burn and should see results as this works every bit of your chest.|`|oPNGEjeSaa	uh mine just sort of grew in (i'm one of the lucky ones), but I still work them out regularly.

8TZzjGsnaa	When you need to have your gall bladder removed there is usually a reason. The gall bladder may have been the cause of the weight being there in the first place. In other words you probably lost all that weight due to having your gall bladder removed, it may have been causing Edema (swelling from water building up in tissue) so the sudden weight loss may not be a big concern. I do not care if you do not have insurance though, you need to go to the hospital ER immediately, They can not refuse to treat you, and I have been there numerous times and I have no money or insurance. I have bills from the hospital but I explained to them that I am unable to pay for the time being and they understand. I do not mean to frighten you but you may have developed a clot, and you could suffer a stroke or a heart attack if you do not take care of it now. If you smoke then you need to stop. Call around and see if there are any free health care clinics in your neighborhood. I have been going to one for about 2 years now, and they have helped me greatly when it comes to my asthma and getting my medication. You will need to take in 2 forms of ID and fill out some paper work but it is worth it for those who do not have insurance.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	Well don't worry so much and relax and maybe that could help with the pains.

Good luck.|`|4yzxXO1haa	Make sure you're getting eight hours of sleep a night, whether you have work to do or not (if you have trouble sleeping, try these: http://www.well.com/~mick/insomnia/). Always take a five minute break every half-hour/forty minutes when studying, and drink plenty of water. Try to get exercise, even if it's just a few long walks a week (with some occasional small amounts of jogging) and a dancing class, or bike ride or Pilate's class.  Eat small serves of fresh fruit several times a day, along with things like low-fat biotic yoghurt and a slice of wholegrain toast. Cut back on caffeine and sugar.  Also, every few days, do something relaxing, like taking a long hot bath, lying down and listening to some good music, going for a picnic at the park with friends or catching a movie. During these, try not to think of anything stressful. Down-time is really important, and your brain needs time to recuperate.

nN8D64Yzaa	you do sound very thin, but its understandable as a recovering anorexic. the internet is probably not the best way to get a good opinion on whether or not you should gain or maintain (definitely don't lose anymore, hun!). if you're in treatment, your therapists and doctors should be helping you with your weight.     obviously i don't know what your weight was before you became ill, but since you're still so young i personally would recommend making an effort to gain weight. this doesn't have to be 'flab' or anything--i'm sure you have a good exercise routine, and with some fibrous and high-protein foods, you can put on weight and look very, very healthy.    good luck with everything, please try your hardest not to revert back to starving yourself. you're so young, and i'm sure you'll learn that the lowest weight is not always the happiest weight for you. remember to tell a friend, parent, or therapist if you really feel like you're slipping from your recovery.|`|pSryQTckaa	I'd say you're good, but gaining a little wouldn't hurt.

zyHfRp5Faa	It depend where you had it. If you had an endometriosis on your ovary and fallopian tubes, it can delay and decrease your ability to have baby.  I'm also still can not fully understand what, why, when, how, etc about endometriosis. Cos it's happening to me too.  I'm also had one on my left tube (a 9.5cm), and doctors said it damaged my left tube already. I have done the laparoscopic surgery to remove it, and i have been injected with Zoladex (hormonal medicine), and I have been using birth control pills. But it still coming back again to me (it's 4.5cm now). So now, I'm only depend on my right side to have baby. ( So sad... when i'm really want to have one now!)   Doctors said, maybe the endometriosis was the cause i can't get baby for 6 years since my first son born. Because i never took any pills or any contraceptive methods to protect me for 6 years and i never had baby for this period of time.  Now, i'm trying to have baby with doctors help, just hope and pray that i'll have good news soon.  Try this site to help you understand better about endometriosis.  Good luck and get well soon.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	Were you recently diagnosed with Endometriosis? I was diagnosed with it at age 19. Endometriosis causes tissue that would otherwise be growing in your uterus to grow in other areas of the body outside of the uterus. This tissue can grow on your ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowels, bladders, and in rare cases brain or lungs. Since this tissue is supposed to grow in the uterus it acts as though it is and it fills up with fluid cysts and bursts/sheds each month at the same time as your menstrual cycle. However, since the fluid filled cysts(commonly called endometriomas or "chocolate cysts") is not in the uterus it cannot exit the body. It has nowhere to go and it can cause pain, inflammation, and scar tissue. For some women who suffer from Endometriosis this scar tissue causes the fallopian tubes to become blocked. If this happens, chances of conception are significantly decreased.    Another thing that you should know is that Endometriosis is an estrogen dominance disease, meaning that it is related to an excess of  the hormone estrogen. An estrogen dominance means a lower progesterone level. A lowered progesterone level can make achieving pregnancy difficult.  Infertility can be an issue due to this and/or scar tissue. That being said there are some women with Endometriosis who go on to conceive children naturally with no problems. For those of us who are having difficulty conceiving there are fertility drugs and medical procedures for fertility such as invitro fertilization. If your fallopian tubes are the culprit there is a procedure that may be able to unblock them(HSG) and quite a few women have gone on to get pregnant after the procedure.  A great majority of doctors do not become concerned and won't run a tests until after you have been unsuccessfully trying to conceive for at least a year, unless you are over the age of 30. I wish you the best of luck. :-)|`|XFVUejr4aa	Actually it is caused when endometrial cells collect on other organs with in the abdominal cavity. They are supposed to stay with in the uterus and make up your endometrium which is your uterine lining. The cause lesions on the organs that they attach themselves too in your pelvic cavity. I had I mean I have fourth stage endometriosis. I have it on my ovaries the outside of my uterus ... bowels bladder and small intestine. At this stage I was considered infertile because of the extent of distortion of my ovaries. That was determined in 1996. I have had two healthy children since and I am now 8 months pregnant with my third. It really depends upon the woman the stage of the disease you are in and the extent of damage from the endometriosis.|`|yev2iWgWaa	uterine wall thickens and uterine glands increase thickening. there will be hormonal imbalance. if treated with hormones there is every chance of having children       all the best

I tend to get along ,and vice versa, with younger people because they are still having fun and living a little. Most of the friends around my age  ( 49) are usually fat ,lazy and are almost ready to die and are no fun at all. It seems all they want to do is go to a bar and get wasted and that is their fun but, that is not me and it never has been.I still take good care of myself and still like to go swimming and mountain biking ,hiking ,and have adventures as much as I did when I was younger in years. I am raising my 3 kids, by myself  I might add,  ( wife took off and married a bottle of Vodka )   to enjoy life and not let it slip by sitting on the couch and they agree with me. Yes I work and take care of my family and such but in my spare time I like to enjoy life and I will never be ready to sit down and let life pass me by, and maybe that is the way your friends mother is.

ETcBRko3aa	The only way to figure out how your cutting is a resultant of your sexual abuse is to investigate its purpose and meaning in therapy.  Only a therapist can put two and two together.....    There have been many speculations such as:  Seeing the blood seems like you are cleaning yourself out  Cutting brings you back from a dissociated state  etc  etc    But it is individualized.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Sex is more than touch - and it's meaning to a person becomes a part of the person's mind-soul-and memory.  Sexual contact touches the emotional part of a person, it touches the "who" of who you are, your value, your worth, it credits or discredits that "who" depending on the context in which sexual contact was made.    No one can argue that the origin of sex was for married couples, and for the purpose of birthing babies into that family.   Within the context of marriage - so long as no one feels forced or abused in participation -  sex is a beautiful expression of love-of emotional connection-of mind and body enjoying the presence and companionship and ultimate acceptance within a personal relationship.    In any other context, the person can feel used or abused, lower than dirt, sensing a deep dark hole in their soul.  When a person of any age feels forced, in pain, or that in some way they have been tricked into participation - or threatened ........then that person may / will feel shame, an emotion that cuts deep and stays with a person for a lifetime.  Shame lowers a person's view of themself.  They feel dirty in a way that won't wash off.  Their tears flow, but there is no morning when they wake feeling better about themself.  There is a pain of the soul that causes the person to believe they have become unworthy of what is good and right and pleasant.  Sex for this person loses the holy quality, even in marriage.  Sex has become dirty for them and they will try anything in the world to try to feel clean.   Many people who have been inappropriately touched - molested - raped - tortured, feel they could have somehow avoided the situation, and that the guilt they feel is their own "fault".  (HERE IS THE ANSWER)  This victim of sexual abuse can believe that if they punish their body or mind or the who of who they are.........there will come relief if only they can somehow remove their guilt of the soul.   So, why do people who've been sexually abused / molested CUT? or vomit, or seek to get high or seek dangerous sexual encounters?  They seek love and acceptance and wholeness of mind and body, but they believe something un-namable must be removed from their body inorder to obtain that relief, inorder to remove that deep shame.    No, cutting is not the cure, neither is vomiting, or any of the other things people try.   Sexual abuse leaves scars for a lifetime.    There is a way to move from being a "victim" to being a "survivor".  It involves finding a safe place to talk about the abuse.  Its basis is to come to believe in both your head and your heart that the sexual abuse "was not your fault".  The other person who did this to you was the guilty one, and there is no excuse in the world for taking that from you.   Talking with a counselor is very helpful in restoring your mind and heart.   Finding forgiveness for yourself is restoring of the soul.  True, the memories will always be there, the reactions you have.  But the counselor can help you to learn to separate "what was then" from "what is now".|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	Some people cut because of mental illness. Others cut because they think that they deserve it. When someone has been sexually molested, sometimes they go through a period where they actually believe that it is their fault and they may use cutting as a way of punishing themselves. I have heard of people who claimed to feel "numb" or "dead" and said that they cut themselves to feel alive and to see the blood, which was proof to them that they were, in fact, alive. Cutting makes some people feel in control. They likely did not feel in control of being sexually molested and cutting themselves gives them that feeling of control, although it is not a positive outlet.    People have different reasons and for someone who has been sexually molested he or she may think that cutting is a way of coping. Cutting is not a good thing, obviously but until the person seeks help for the underlying cause, which is the sexual molestation, he or she may continue to cut themselves, causing physical scars along with he emotional scars from the sexual molestation.
1Ih01vPIaa	Well I don't think your Brother-in-law cared when he was doing that to you and what if he's doing it to someone else.  I don't think I could live with that kind of guilt, you didn't make him what he is, but you are letting him get away with it and you should feel guilty about that.  Tell now and good luck.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	He is sick.  If he did it to you, he's doing it to some other child now.  You owe it to them to let this be known.    Pedophiles cannot be cured.  They must be identified and managed by the law enforcement system.    More than one young person has taken their life because they couldn't cope with these memories.    Save a child.  Do what's right!|`|47R03TbFaa	YOU NEED TO TELL YOUR MOM BECAUSE GOD FOR BID YOUR SISTER AND HIM HAVE KIDS THINK OF WHAT HE CAN DO TO THEM PLEASE STOP IT NOW DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MAN PUT HIM BEHIND BARS WHERE HE BELONGS .

PLEASE REPORT HIM TELL EVERYONE WHO IS WILLING TO LISTEN AND SO WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS MAN AND YOUR SISTER ENDS YOUR ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN HE IS BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER AND TELL YOUR MOM GOOD LUCK TO YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET SOME COUNSELING IT HELPS|`|AA10953999	Tell her because for all you know he is still molesting other little girls. You owe it to yourself and to any little girls that may come in contact with this sick pervert, hopefully he doesn't have any children of his own.     Your sister deserves to know she married a pervert that should be in jail. You should also get counseling for this, it may effect your future relationships.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	1)  You experienced something that has damaged you - and this is no exaggeration!      2)  You need help to get through this, and to move beyond it - Counseling    3)  Telling your mom is how to get to that help you need.    4)  This man did this to you - and he will go on to find other girls to touch and treat the same way - damaging them too.   He must be stopped.    5)  It is not you who would be at fault for a family crisis.  He did this.  And this is not your fault.  As an adult he must be held accountable!|`|PN5wdj9Daa	You may want to talk to someone else before you tell your mom.  That person would probably be most helpful if they were an adult and a sexual abuse counselor. This person could help you sort out your feelings and fears and then even be with you when you do tell your mother.    You could find such a person at your local rape and incest crisis center or by contacting RAINN at www.rainn.org or 1-800-656-HOPE.  It is totally confidential and free!    It took me 40 years to tell my sister. Don't wait too long.|`|Tt6lkGrUaa	well if he was old enough to know what he was doing was wrong then I would tell someone. that's just me tho. I would actually tell your sister first in case she needs some time to think about things.|`|2aEU1lmpaa	If he did it to you he'll do it to other girls.  You need to tell someone for that reason and also so you can get some counseling.

Your mother will be behind you no matter what.  You are her daughter, she is not going to believe a  man who married her older daughter over you.    You will be helped by your mother and she will give you all  the guidance you need and deserve.    you don't want a load on you back that will be haunting you for the rest  of your life.  It will be worse when your involved with someone too.  Do something now and quick.
VOccyg7daa	I've seen it used as toothpaste, as a matter of fact I use baking soda toothpaste but never heard of it as mouthwash.  How would you do that, just dissolve some in water. Yuck, that would taste really nasty.|`|2aEU1lmpaa	The only danger is swallowing too much of it, you can actually die of baking soda overdose.  But as a mouthwash it's great and you can also dissolve 1 tsp. in a cup of water and drink it for heartburn because it does neutralize acid.|`|GueE0to5aa	You could use normal mouthwash. Baking soda, though primitively used as soap in ancient times, works somewhat, modern antiseptics work much better in protection against bacteria in your mouth than baking soda ever can.    Also, since it's slightly acidic, long term baking soda use may lead to cavities, but it's better than soda :)

But both my mother and my auntie did fall pregnant on the pill, so dont trust when it comes to having sex ok?  bye bye!|`|A2g3mUF5aa	For some girls I've talked to they have.

ONuy5vniaa	I used to smoke alot of pot but felt great when I quit, but the reason I stopped was because I was getting severe anxiety attacks everytime I smoked it.    I missed it a lot and found it hard to resist for about a month or 2, but knowing it just doesn't make me feel good anymore was good enough to surpass temptation.    I guess what I'm trying to tell you is, in order to get over these feelings you have to focus on the reason you quit and consider it an important goal in life. The feelings will go away, trust me on this one.|`|8cf79148e562829978c35b0998c28a7eaa	when i was a young adult i did smoke a bit of pot, though maybe not that much to say heaps n heaps...but firstly congrats on quitting, its a very big step u have challenged...make sure you find yourself again, and enjoy the things you once enjoyed before this became an addiction!!!! keep it up :)|`|gyZ0U7JTaa	Yes, it does get better with time and a made up mind is the most important thing.|`|9Y9BBB99aa	i smoke every day of my life and i got put on proabation.... the first couple weeks is soooo hard and after u get through it you wont have any temptation to smoke.... i mean ive relapsed like 10 times tho and im on proabation and still smoking...but trust me itll get easiear|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Yes.

UZxeBrxQaa	The tablets will work best, as they are in the blood stream and will reach every part of your body that is affected.    Also, the tablets reduce the histamines in your blood that are causing the problem to begin with.
ParFJxnSaa	It is important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately.     Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I'm never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even: "I can't do this/will never get over this!", even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that this is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!"       You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method.|`|rvmiK8rgaa	I think millions of people have experienced this.    From my experience, a coupla books:    Compassion and Self-Hate by T.I.Rubin MD deals with the issue if crazy thoughts.      Control of mind is the subject of Concentration by Ernest Wood - which you can read online as an ebook.    You my have racing thoughts 'cos you are a brilliant thinker.   Take it easy.|`|1737da704d8ddbe98304fd7ad6630f82aa	Yeah this happens to me AL-OT. I think of stupid things and my thoughts never shut up, I always think and sub-speak in my head to no end. I just start to hit myself when this happens because I can never get a song out of my head. The worst part is I can actually think of two songs at the same time.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	Yes, you can control your thoughts. Sounds like you have a wild imagination, maybe you should be a writer.|`|rbUXsgDBaa	The answer is a resounding YES you should be able to control your thoughts! You may be bipolar or schizophrenic please make an appointment with your Dr. Racing thoughts can also be a sign of depression.

That does not mean that she has sexually transnmitted type of herpes.  Even small children can get cold sores and they are caused by herpes.

You might ask your spiritual adviser to help you with your trust issues, honey.|`|a984cQjKaa	it's a cold sore.  they're caused by the herpes simplex 1 virus.  this is a totally different strain than the strain that causes genital herpes, which is caused by the herpes simplex 2 virus.  maybe if you did some research instead of hiding from sex like a scared little child, you wouldn't be going off half-****** thinking your girlfriend was cheating on you.  she deserves better.
3vZuEKU9aa	Actually hon, I used a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator, and you're right in the Normal Weight range at 20.4 (overweight is 25-29.9; obese is 30 or higher); if you're muscular, then of course you will weigh more, as muscle is heavier than fat. However, muscle burns a lot of fat, so if you're a little on the heavier side but are in good shape, you should be fine :)|`|xwxEMWCFaa	http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/    http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bmi-cal...    http://health.discovery.com/tools/calcul...      go to these websites and play around on them until you get the right info.i use these sometimes.but my weight isn't exactly what the sites and doctors want.they have an ideal weight for your body.but if you are a person who works out and lifts a lot of weights like myself,then you will weigh more because you have more muscle on your body than fat.so your fat will be less,but the weight may be more.everyone's body is different and shouldn't have any ideal weight for real.my doctors and trainers at the gym say as long as you eat healthy majority of the time and are active and exercising at least 4 to 5 times a week for 30Min's to a hour and can run and walk without being out of breath,then you are fine.so i dont trip off what my weight should be to my height.i do not know what person or people come out with these crazy numbers for weight.      well hopefully i helped

iw2cckG5aa	Don't you think this is a little overdone?|`|eu6UQElYaa	Actually they don't have to come from aborted fetuses.  In fact, the ones that have yielded the most promise are ones that have come from adults.  Truth be told I'm for stem cell research but not embryonic stem cell research and for me that decision really doesn't have to do with the abortion debate.  The reason I don't like this whole nonsense about embryonic stem cell research is because it drives attention (and therefore funding) away from other types of stem cell research that has gotten a lot further in terms of curing things like cancer, parkinson's etc. etc.  than the embryonic stem research.   I want to see the money and the time and the attention going to the area that is getting results and therefore the area that will bring us to cures faster.  Embryonic stem cell research is, at this point, more useful as a distraction than as having real medical value.|`|e4QW4xvOaa	"also try explaining to me why it's so awful to continue life out from something that would have never lived anyway" You should research something before you attempt to begin to debate it. The Fetus is murdered, then used for research. At one point, scientists where artificially impregnating woman with the sole purpose of aborting the fetus to use for research. What kind of person who make a baby with the sole intention of only killing it to gain a bit of knowledge? Stem cell research does have the potential to regenerate a heart, brain, but not likely to cure cancer. The problem is, how many hundreds of thousands more babies will have to die before scientists can actually find a cure? We can't even be 100% sure stem cell research has all this potential. Would you be so greedy as to take another persons life just so you can have a better one? Next thing you know, we will be keeping artificially inseminated humans in cages so we can later use their organs when ours fail. Humanity itself is self destructing.|`|421b093f3a26e984609f4230f395d7d9aa	Hi! People get this miscomunnicated. Stem cell research is wonder, even to a strong pro-lifer. If you study the research, you will find that when embryotic stem cells are introduced into a person, the outcome is disasterous.  The cells for a tumor with small human parts in it.  They have found teeth, hair etc.  There has never been ONE successful experiment. On the other hand adult stem cells from the host has had many successful outcomes.  A doctor in Brazil has done this with a Quadraplegic and a diabetic and cured both.  He extracted the stem cells and "cleaned" them before injecting them back!  They were both and other, cured! Ingenious! Why isn't this on TV or looked into?  Why aren't we putting our moneys and research into something that works instead of wasting money on something that is second rate or semi-impossible.  Why aren't our scientists checking the work of other countries as much as they focus on a way of using fetus brains that are sucked out, while the baby is alive, partially out of the womb and then Jammed with sissors at the base of the skull with no anisthetic to get the stems cells.  I've seen the procedure and even the hardest person gets tears in his eyes--it's torture to sometimed a  fully formed 6 month baby in many cases.  When Bush tried to get moneys passed for adult stem cell research, the liberals wouldn't accept the plan unless it included using not just embyos, but fully formed babies. To me, that is nonsense!  To aquire something good from an evil or wrong source always brings disaster somewhere down the line.  You can see it in our country ever since Roe v Wade.  I know you don't see the downward spiral, but I'm older and have watched it happen.  I used to be a hippie activest and now I am seeing the truth.  The other reason that we fight the embryo stem cell research is because the agenda in our government is to be able to apply a name--"Not important"--to anyone or thing that the government deems usless.  Next, may be the mentally ill or elderly. Right now there is a bill that is being considered to allow a mother to allow a baby to be put to sleep up to 3 days a fter the birth--due to illness or in the future--other reasons.  We are not looking at just now, we are looking towards the future and seeing the same thing happen that did with the Nazis.  We never thought humans could allow themselves to harm others for science sake.  We used to say "America would never allow abortion because we know they are human."  Now I believe that we can be manipulated into callusness by using the right vocabulary. You sound like a person that is so caring and loving that you could never watch a puppy in pain or hear it's cry. Science has prooved that many of these fetuses have screamed with pain from these procedures--even has it on film.  To you a fetus has no other worth, so use it's parts for science, but to use these stem cells they must still be alive to get them. Do they feel the pain?  Oh well, I just wish that the government would put more money in research they KNOW works instead of wasting huge ammounts of money on MAYBE's  Also I wish they would split the bill and have a bill for moneys for Adult stem cell or imbilical cord etc. research.  Why won't they do it?  Because abortion is a huge money making industry and they don't want to loose their backers. When you actually research all I have said and see the data with open eyes, it's a whole different picture. Do you actually believe we pro-lifers would want anyone to be in pain?  I Take care of Alzheimers patients in my home that no one wants--for 21 years and I work for hospice. I see so much pain and cry.  I understand your great caring and confusion.  Thank you for being honest and communicating instead of poking fun of people like me.  God Bless!
AA11388527	Ripper, thanks for e-mailing me about this.  Your friend can't tell you the bone is bruised because your friend doesn't know.  He's guessing.  The symptoms of a bone bruise are severe pain and swelling and sometimes a black-blue discoloration.  From what you told me in your e-mail, the bone doesn't sound bruised.  Keep icing it, "buddy splint" the finger (wrap it and your index finger together) so you can immobilize it for a week or so.  You'll be okay, Ripper but you are the most accident prone dude.  LOL!  I'm going to wrap you in cotton and keep you safe.    As always stay in touch and take care, okay?
HPn6MN7Daa	dont mix stuff, and peroxide is bad for your face|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	peroxide is not safe for your face.
BI8c6XXPaa	It can be. My doctor said sometimes when you feel cramping around the middle of your month, it is because your ovaries are literally twisting trying to release that egg.    If you are comfortable with this, you can track your cervical mucus. Stick your finger up there and if you can stretch the mucus to at least 3 inches, than ovulation is close. Have sex if you want to get pregnant, or don't if you want to prevent pregnancy. Write it all down on a calendar.    Get an ovulation tester kit. You can test your body if you're ovulating as soon as you start to feel cramping.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	I never ache while ovulating ; but I know some woman does ; and there nothing you can do ; but at least you are warn that you can get pregnant if you have intercourse
H6l7rxNnaa	yeah that doesnt sound to great, keep an eye on her. maybe shell be okay since this may not be the first time shes doing this but still that doesnt sound so great.|`|CyIxcsz0aa	She won't overdose and DIE. But her liver and stomach won't be too happy. I got a stomach ucler from taking to much advil/tylenol during a lot of dental work (and a lot of pain due to it). I've taken a hell lot more then 5 before, but I wasn't then.  It's going to be bad news if she keeps it up and make sure she is not drinking or taking drugs with it or she COULD die.   She should stick to 2 or 3.     P.S. Tylenol PM isn't designed to treat insomnia. If it's really an issue, she should talk to a psychiatrist or even a regular physician. They will probably hook her up with anti-psychotics or anti-anxiety medications. Some of them can cause sleep like you wouldn't believe!!|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	omg becareful with those PM medicines!!! They really eff you up. I once took it to school and I was like HIGH as HELL! omg.. I was completely of it. People legit thought I was high. Youre not even supposed to take more than one at a time for every 6hrs or so|`|HmXViQipaa	Oh ya!  The most I have ever took of those at one time is 3..I stay up all night..Always have.  My mother and grandmother have this problem too.  My grandmother and I kinda just deal w/ it.  My mother on the other hand pops pills all the time.  I only take them if I have to get up early the next morning.  My mother mixed the pills though w/ prescriptions and ended up in the hospital several times getting her stomach pumped.  Everyone has a threshold..Eventually, your sister will have to take one more then maybe add another b/c 5-6 stop working..She will eventually reach her threshold and not even know it.  It may feel and seem like to her she has built up a tolerance so she might keep adding them on and on until one night she bottoms out. I'm not trying to be mean..or nasty but this is how addiction starts..Something as simple as Tylenol PM.  She won't even see it coming.  I'm not trying to be neg. but I have experienced this first hand w/ my mother..Now she is too far gone.  It all started w/ "I can't sleep."|`|23e6287b78d1587e57b2d262f45629b1aa	Tylenol PM has ingredients also found in Benadryl. Benadryl taken in higher doses can have the opposite effect of those taking it if they take too much.      If your sister is having trouble sleeping, I suggest she go to the health store and look for "Melatonin". It is a natural sleep aide and Melatonin is naturally produced in the body to aide in the sleep process.      If the Melatonin doesn't work, then it is time to see a doctor.|`|Mula85EKaa	Oh my yes and that kills the liver and shuts down the kideys so I hope you look up the cause of tylenol overdose it is one the worse overdoses to take cause it shuts down the liver and kidneys and long term damage can cause liver cancer  Number one killer in children overdose is tylenol  Look it up|`|HCMrR1O9aa	no, if her body has already built up an immunity to the tylenol pm, then 5 wont harm her....i myself have to take 3 or 4 to actually go to sleep. some people just have a higher tolerance. especially if she is an insomniac. but its good to know that people do still actually care about other people now adays....|`|OQhDSYMAaa	It depends on the person. Tolerance does play in how many they need to take for them to be affective, along with weight, age. The biggest concern would be her longer term health. Five isn't enough for the average adult to over dose on, maybe an infant or small child. In the long run these doses will take a toll on her liver. Her liver can not filter out a dose that large all at once, so it ends up damaging her system.    She won't die today, but she'll be taking a few years off if this is a habit.|`|bldzLsmkaa	she wont overdose i dont think but if she continues to do it shell shut down her kidneys|`|gugWAeiBaa	She won't overdose, but it can be bad for her liver over time.

fAcVndo7aa	That's a bit young, in my opinion, to say that you "have" to go.  Most recommend that you begin seeing a gynecologist when you are 18-21, or when you start engaging in sexual activity.  You will need to take your clothes off.  However, you won't be sitting there naked.  You will be given a gown - and some doctors even let you leave your shirt and bra on.  You'll also have sheets to cover you below the waist.  As for invasive procedures - well, you're right, it's pretty much unavoidable.  That is, unless you don't want to know if something is wrong.  Don't worry - the internal exam is fairly short and shouldn't be painful.  The main thing is to keep in mind that you're there to be sure that you're healthy.  It may help to have a female doctor, or even a certified nurse-midwife.  They're not just for delivering babies.  Everyone goes through the same worries when you start visiting the gynecologist.  It'll be okay - there's pretty much nothing they haven't seen before.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	I completely understand where you're coming from.  It's not my favorite time of the year, either.  But it sounds like you know about how important it is that you go, which is good.    Talk to your doctor about it, let him or her know about your fears.  Doctors are pretty understanding about that.  The procedure itself I wouldn't call "invasive" but it is uncomfortable.      If you have a male gyno, by law there has to be a female nurse present in the room.  If you would feel more comfortable with a female gyno, get one.  Lots of women request a specific gender of doctor.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	why are you going to a gyn for at that age ,,,, are you sexual active or what    see a g p doctor for a check up|`|SghwXlQ9aa	Isn't that kind of young? Don't you have to be sexually active to see one? If not, don't worry, gynecologists are professionals and nothing will be new to them. They see vaginas every single day. It's their job! It's totally normal that you are uncomfortable with showing your private parts, but it is for medical reasons, and after a few times, I'm sure you will be totally comfortable with it. If it helps, make sure you get a female doctor. I know I wouldn't want a man looking down there! Good luck. =]|`|b22d33b389f66522a42da38105df85caaa	During your examination there will be a nurse in the room with you and the doctor. You will be wearing a paper or plastic gown so you can relax about being totally nude in front of a stranger. A metal or plastic   device called a "speculum" will be inserted into your vagina so the doctor can examine you during the pelvic exam; yes, it is "invasive" but it must be done so the doc can do a complete examination.    Talk to your gynecologist before the exam and explain your feelings; he or she will be very aware of your modesty and will respect your privacy.    Hope this helps you.    Good luck.
BhFeii5Xaa	Most GPs are super confident they can treat our problems and won't necessarily refer us to endos! But they don't have the time to be reading the latest treatment for lots of lifestyle changing conditions either.    If it makes you feel better, go see an endo! If your insurance is such that you don't need a referral to the endo, make an appointment. It will probably take up to a year to get in, but by then you will be more assured than you are now.    Most of us take blood draw testing every 3 months and see the PCP or GP on that schedule. People see the Endo every 6 months to a year. Along with having appointments for eyes, feet, cancer testings, etc once a year.    The main number to be concerened with is the HbA1c which you should strive to keep under 6 and under 5 if at all possible.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Insulin level is not a problem.  Your insulin levels are normal, it's just that insulin isn't doing its job because your muscles and other tissues are insulin resistant.    Your job now is blood glucose control.  Hopefully you've gotten a glucometer (blood glucose meter) and you are monitoring your blood sugar, you are also eating right, staying away from carbohydrates, and getting some exercise.    Under normal conditions you don't need to see an endocrinologist.  Your doctor will order a test of A1c, glycolated hemoglobin, every six months or so.  As long as it stays in the 'safe' range, you are fine.  If it goes out of bounds, then she will change your meds.  A1c measures the amount of your red blood cells that are bound to glucose molecules, which makes them sticky and damages your circulation.  It is sort of like an 'average' blood glucose measurement over time.    In the meanwhile you have to learn what you can eat, how different foods affect you, how exercise effects you.  You do this by measuring your blood glucose 2 hrs after each meal, and first thing in the morning (fasting).  We are all different.  Your body becomes one big science experiment.  For instance, I learned I could half a potato without much trouble but a few mouthfuls of rice raises my blood glucose over 200.  I found I could have an apple or a little bit of chocolate before I take my walk each evening and it won't show on me.    You should also get your eyes looked at every year or two to see if you are developing retinopathy.  Next time you see your doctor, ask for a referral to an opthalmologist.    Good luck!|`|AA10481903	What is she doing to treat the CAUSE of your insulin resistance?  The medical literature is very consistent on this issue - insulin resistance is a dietary/lifestyle disease!  Correct the diet and lifestyle and you cure the disease.  Treat the signs and symptoms with drugs like Metformin and you have the disease for life.    Here are links to a few scientific references:    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18937...    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18466...    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17922...

Endos specialize in diabetes and insulin resistance and may have other ideas on how to control your blood sugar levels and insulin resistance.  Even if you go just a few times, it's worth seeing a specialist to help get this under control.

In any case, you should grow out the hair before waxing and it may hurt either way.|`|SghwXlQ9aa	There are both pros and cons to waxing and shaving. With shaving, it is easier and mostly painless, but the hair grows back thicker and you have to maintain it more often. Waxing, you only have to do that about once a month and it keeps your hair thin, but it really really really hurts. A lot!   It you start to shave, your hair will grow back thicker, so yes, I would think that waxing would hurt more after shaving for a while. It all depends on you and your preference.|`|G1OJNCF4aa	Let it grow out then wax it, waxing is better it keeps your hair a lot thinner|`|WOT9yIuFaa	Well waxing will hurt the 1st time regardless if u shave or not.|`|5bWYjqO9aa	i heard waxing is really sore!!  :)|`|5wARwhe9aa	Waxing is going to hurt the first several times you do it, regardless if you shave or not.    Your hair doesn't grow back thicker. It appears to be thicker because it is cut off at the surface of the skin and isn't as long and light as it previously appeared. It seems darker because your hair previously has been through the elements (sun etc..). All you can see is the little end of it poking through the skin until it grows out a little more! It grows at the same rate and thickness and darkness.     Waxing is supposed to thin it out some over time because it rips it out by the root. I'd imagine waxing right after shaving would be pretty hard because there wouldn't be anything for the wax and paper to stick to.

Prescription painkillers work the best for me, but they do tend to make me groggy. It may seem counter-intuitive, but exercise is actually the best way to fight the debilitating effects of FM.    Doctors are still researching this disease, no known cause or cure yet, though some type of neural system physical trauma seems to be the triggering event for most people (as it was for me). The more active you are, the less it will affect you.|`|AA12197490	I've had fms for 10 yrs. now and I know where you're coming from.  I was recently given Lyrica from my doctor.

You're right about lyrica making sleepy all day but at least it takes the edge off. Sometimes the meds don't work at all. Then my whole body goes into excruciating pain.

You see Fibromyalgia is a catch word for something the doctors don't know what else to call. they can't put there fingers on it. They take a system of 18 points and work backward, if you have a certain number of these points, it must be Fibromyalgia. I know this is not what you want to here but that's the facts.       Fibro is akin to osteoarthritis and Rheumatism with aches and pains. It's treated in almost the same manner, what works for one, may not work for the other.       Pain pills is about the only thing out there at times, there are shots also. Try a good pain clinic.|`|oP3VVW5raa	As 'sugarpie' said evening primrose oil is very good for the symptoms you have.    Evening Primrose Oil has the same structure as the fatty coating or myelin that covers the surface of the brain.  If you have a healthy braincoat then you good nerve conduction and your nerves wont pick up messages that you have unbearable pain when there has been no structural damage to the area.    'Handy Man' is on the right path too - it makes such a difference when your muscles are strong and your blood is pumping smoothly from exercise.
ParFJxnSaa	Depression, self harm, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder spring to mind. A selection of treatments follow: If you can't deal with it by using one of the techniques, such as counting backwards from 20, to 1, (and prevent yourself from making yourself angry, in the first place) is important to express that anger appropriately, at the time, and to the person who caused it, if possible, or immediately afterwards. If not, maybe by walking away later, and bellowing your rage and/or frustration. In some situations, such as work, or school, it might be better to cover your mouth with a cupped hand, bandanna/handkerchief, or use the crook of your elbow, to muffle the sound. Some people find that it helps to journal those thoughts, and emotions soon afterwards.     Anger, which is repressed, rather than healthily expressed, tends to fester, and later may cause explosive fits of rage, or depression. Let yourself feel the burning energy of that anger, and visualise it, as vividly as possible, as a hot flame cleansing you. It can help to have someone you can talk to. For more physically inclined people, a punching bag, or hitting your pillow, can be an effective release mechanism: visualise, as vividly as you can, that you are striking back at the cause of that anger. "But next time, when you get mad, just remember this quote: 'Those who anger you, conquer you.' It's basically saying that when you give someone the power to make you mad, or let it get to you, it's like they're controlling you.     When I realized that, it made me mad, so I try to control my anger and not let people see it. You can still control your anger without being walked all over. You just have to draw a line." Try saying to yourself, in your mind: "I am fire! I am ice!". Repeat for as long as it takes for you to calm down sufficiently. Anger management is addressed in much more detail than can be included here, in section 4, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris and practice daily, one of the relaxation methods in section 2, 2.c, 11, or 2.i Most people find the progressive muscular relaxation simple, and it can be done in several minutes. Others prefer to repeat a word, like "easy" in their minds, or a short phrase, and focusing your attention on your breath is another technique. You will know from the ease of use, and effect, which suits you best.    A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective. These will enable you to emotionally centre yourself, when practiced regularly. Yoga, and/or T'ai Chi may also help you become a calmer, more self controlled person, who is less influenced by the behaviour of others.

It can't be easy to lose a close family member just when you feel distant from the ones who usually support you.    It also sounds like you are dealing with a lot of stressors that are part of your first year at the university: living in a new environment all on your own, managing a tough class schedule and dealing with lots of new people all at the same time.    I hit this roadblock when I was a freshman.  It was a combination of being isolated from all of my favorite things back home, being out of contact with a lot of my friends, and living with people who all seemed to have different values than me.  There was no one I could really be myself with.    What really helped me out was that one day, I decided to get up and look for someone who I could relate with.  And so I walked around and talked to everyone whose door was open.  And I met my best friend.    You should also call your family and friends if you are thinking of them.  They may be thinking about you as well, and wondering why you haven't called.

3vZuEKU9aa	I've been in a similar situation; feeling down all the time, little things setting me off, overactive or no appetite that fluctuated a lot, that sort of thing. I did some very extensive research on depression, and a lot of those reactions are symptoms of depression. However, it's only if these feelings persist for more than 2 weeks and it interferes with your ability to function is it said to be possible clinical depression.    If you're really worried, it wouldn't hurt to see your doctor, or if you go to school, your counselor. Depression isn't your fault, it's caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain that sometimes requires intervention either by therapy, or a change in your lifestyle that might be causing you stress.    Since you say your family life is bad, the stress could be causing you to feel this way, even if it's nothing new; if you can, try getting away at a friend's house for a few days or a week or so, and see if you feel any better. Otherwise, exercise is good; it causes a release of endorphins that does help to make you feel better. It also helps if while you're exercising, you're doing it with someone that makes you happy to be around.    Good luck!|`|ldpDzaolaa	Normal self esteem issues of growing up.

h0oHTKThaa	Dude. Just find something to do out of the house, so you just won't have the option to go to sleep. Tonight, do your normal whatever you do, then when it feels like bedtime (I'm assuming sometimes towards morning), make an awesome over-the-top breakfast to pump you up because YOU'RE GOING OUT!. Make an extra large pot of coffee if you drink it (if you don't, oh boy. (kidding)-caffeine will help though. find some. sobe adrenaline rush energy drink does it for me).  Now leave. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.   So. What to do? Can you go shopping for your school things? Get books? Study up on beginning material? Well I suppose that would make staying awake a bit difficult - scratch that. Go for a walk, go to the local animal shelter and play with the puppies. Go to the homeless shelter and play with the people?   Once it's daytime and you're out of your bed zone, you're safe. Get in the right mindset, and you can find enough to do until nighttime. Just have an open mind and be spontaneous...  If you HAVE to stay wherever your bed is, clean, do laundry and wash your sheets so they're not available. It's a mental game. Beat your most primal human needs! Defy sleep. Totally possible. I've stayed awake for unnaturally long periods of time quite a few times...you can make 15hrs easy.

If you look in the tea section of your local health food store,  you'll find plenty of inexpensive teas that help stimulate natural  breast growth.     The 4 best breast enlargement teas are: fenugreek, fennel, red  clover, and hops.   These teas are made from phytoestrogenic herbs, which trigger  breast enlargement by rebalancing the hormones.     Try drinking a cup or two per day for fuller, sexier breasts.   Unfortunately, growth hormone levels plummet after age 25. This can  kill your chances of breast growth if you don't take action.     The solution? AMINO ACIDS.     Amino acids are the "protein building blocks" that make up 75% of  your body. What is growth hormone made from? You guessed it - amino  acids!     Studies have shown that amino acids arginine, lysine, and glutamine  can increase growth hormone by as much as 300%!

uC75y83Taa	This is what I learned. Men grow till age 25.  (Women till age 21.) So here are tips that can help, and certainly won't hurt!  Drink 3 glasses of any kind of milk daily.  Eat lots of protein. Meat, chicken, fish, nuts, cheese, eggs.  Check labels on cereals and soups, etc.  Eat lots of veggies.  Fresh, frozen, or steamed. Those frozen mixtures are great.  Munch on carrots, celery, and eat tomatoes.(Technically a fruit, I know.)  Exercise. "They" say that playing basketball outside is the best.  Stand up straight!  Good posture can add 2 inches.

tQZpjamqaa	Well, I guess I'll go personal here - If you feel like you can't breathe, your toes are curling and you feel all stiff, you're doing it right. If it hurts, do it with your hands -     Here's a demonstration, get something that's about 1" in diameter (round, a vibrator/dildo works), or your finger(s), put it inside of yourself, slowly moving it in and out, and gently rub your clitoris with the opposite hand. If you do this properly you should get these feelings:  1. Curling Toes  2. Stiff Body  3. Hard To Breathe  4. Eyes Closed Tightly  5. Open Mouth  6. Moaning/Grunting    If this is your first time playing with yourself or if you are a virgin - just experiment... It's all fun, you'll find something you like...     HAVE FUN!!!

FYUHJyvpaa	Well, some people have expressed reluctance to engage in sports, precisely because there is a requirement to run a number of miles for a while, but otherwise will not be any good. It is not true. You just need to become much more active in your daily life. It is much more realistic, more feasible and therefore more effective. But is it? To begin with - yes. Further increases in physical activity will depend on the speed of metabolic processes in your body and how much fat you need to lose. The gradual increase in workload is quite available, so let's stop for some councils, which should begin.    Try to start the day with a morning cocktail. Nourishing, low, with a lot of fiber, it will help to quickly clear the body, long and still hunger for a month to get rid of the excess of three kilograms. The recipe for it is simple: a cup of any fruit (can be frozen), tablespoon soy, apple juice and a few cubes of ice.|`|wcUhuNPVaa	Join the Aquadome.

Source: United States government...  National Institute on Drug Abuse,  Bureau of Mortality Statistics    Marijuana does not cause serious health problems like those caused by tobacco or alcohol (e.g., strong addiction, cancer, heart problems, birth defects, emphysema, liver damage, etc.). Death from a marijuana overdose is impossible. In all of world history, there has never been a single human death attributed to a health problem caused by marijuana. Legalize marijuana and life would be better for most people.    A 1997 UCLA School of Medicine study (Volume 155 of the American Journal of Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine) conducted on 243 marijuana smokers over an 8-year period reported the following: "Findings from the long-term study of heavy, habitual marijuana smokers argue against the concept that continuing heavy use of marijuana is a significant risk factor for the development of chronic lung disease." "Neither the continuing nor the intermittent marijuana smokers exhibited any significantly different rates of decline in lung function as compared with those individuals who never smoked marijuana." The study concluded: "No differences were noted between even quite heavy marijuana smoking and non-smoking of marijuana."|`|Zki0DuLWaa	Tobacco is going to harm you more.|`|tSZMBTOIaa	Man have you guys ever see the fingers of pot smokers come on. what about the thc in that stuff.I also heard that one joint equals to smoking 10 cigarettes|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	I don't know which is more harmful but they are both really stupid to smoke.

AA10796077	None of us can be absolutely sure that the outcomes of our decisions will turn out the way we want them to.  However, when trying to make a decision about something, you might want to make a checklist of the pros and cons.  If the pros outweigh the cons, then you go with that.  It's important to make some kind of decision or you waste your life worrying.  If it turns out for the best, then you're ahead of the game.  If it doesn't turn out, then you've learned a lesson and next time will make a better decision.  Franklin D. Roosevelt said once- "The only thing to fear is fear itself."  Don't be afraid to try.  Your gut feeling is often the best.  When pondering about something, just sit somewhere quietly and think about it so that you can clear your mind and thoughts.  If you still have problems after that, you may want to get some counseling.  Good luck and "don't worry, be happy" (a song that was popular a few years ago).|`|53b873dc19210bd9e4fae22faf08dc69aa	Everybody that makes a decision and then it turns out wrong looks back and thought why didn't I do the other thing.  Hindsight is 20-20.  Your wanting to know the outcome of your decision before you make it to make yourself know you are making the right one.  That doesn't happen.  I have the same problem with making decisions.  But I am learning not to obsess or get upset when I feel I made the wrong choice.  That is life so I'm trying to let it go. Everybody goes thru that it's just how you handle it that is different.  List pros anf cons and take it from there.  Learning from mistakes is how we grow.|`|YvXYDiBcaa	I have often suffered from and wondered the same thing.

BI8c6XXPaa	Wow, you have gone through a lot. I have problems with my cervix too, due to a traumatic delivery, and I did have a miscarriage, but we don't know if it was because of my cervix or not. Your best bet is to talk to your doctor. Ask him if it would be a high risk pregnancy or delivery. You won't know unless you try. Start tracking your ovulation and figure out when the best time for you to conceive will be. Its too bad you have all these problems, and you are so young.    Hope for the best, be positive.

TORBP6QIaa	YOu need a prescription for that one...see the doctor...and you have to have a BMI over 30 I think.
Ob9AZnA4aa	The best way is to work from the ground up. Strengthen your hips w/ doing various squats (with correct form) and leg building exercises along with plenty of stretches. Don't worry about isometric exercises as much and work with light weights many reps. If you couple this weight lifting w/  core work and endurance training you should improve. The biggest thing in wrestling is really technique though. Technique, momentum, and physicality... Work on the muscles that you expect to be using most in a match to defend mostly. A strong defense would wear down the opponent and make your own moves easier to handle.|`|bxji3S56aa	Get a job moving furniture. lol|`|dC8YVQ6Maa	when u let out a lot of energy, just exhale/blow really smoothly and youll see a significant difference in strength    i know it sounded far fetched at first for me too but it works|`|voaMM1GQaa	It'd important to maintain a weight for wrestling, but I would do lower weight with MUCH more reps to get very toned, and then take rest days for your muscles to build.

You need to have more sex in your daily schedule. Sex is always the answer.|`|0Pv2jt8faa	Perhaps you could try and implement some of your weight training within the ring itself- go old school. I remember my uncles used to get this old rug and lay under it in the middle of the lawn while their brothers would wet it with the hose. The amount of weight on top of them was overwhelming and they just had to power out of it, not only using their strength to push the structure up, but also working against the elements around them.    Others tend to use weighted clothing and try doing cardio or runs so that they're used to carrying and powering through excess weight.     If all else fails, perhaps your frustration is being channeled through physical activities and, as you say, you're simply exhausting that option to a point where it's just meaningless activity. Maybe instead of approaching this problem physically you should try to excersize some of your strategy instead. Know your weaknesses and your opponents weaknesses, do some scouting, get to know others and try not to isolate yourself in your own training.    Good luck.|`|oPNGEjeSaa	I'm in wrestling, and what you have to do (in case you don't know already), is do a high number of reps, and lets say one less set.

YPJkZglMaa	I have the same issue as you, ever since I was a kid and my adult teeth came in, I have what look just like vampire teeth. Its so embarressing that you will never see me smiling and showing my teeth,especially in pics. My sister calls them angel fangs.lol. Sometimes I feel like its weird because I dont know anyone else that has the same thing. I dont want to be associated with being a vampire because people tend to see them as evil. What is worse is that I look nothing like my family all blonde hair, blue eyed and right handed. I am brown eyed, brown haired and left handed, which by the way also indicates that Im (sinister), just for the fact that Im left handed. So anyways, dont feel bad, your not alone.

Eat more fruits and veggies and exercise. It's all about making small lifestyle changes. If you "go on a diet" it means that you are eventually going to "go off the diet".

Eat healthy balanced diets, and exercise.|`|gH7wqHrdaa	Actually, you don't need to diet per se in order to lose weight, the only diet that clearly worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I melted away twenty pounds, it clearly does produce success!|`|75Oa8Ni7aa	This is another fad diet that is probably just as unhealthy as the others and any weight lost will, most likely, return.    Get the book "Nourishing Traditions" by Sally Fallon and Mary Enig.  It will help you with a well founded life-long diet.
E2CdbyB9aa	Try leg exercises, for instance, leg lifts, stairs, walking/jogging, treadmill, bicycle and you can use exercise balls to which help alot same a palaties|`|nN8D64Yzaa	to lose inner thigh fat you gotta lose fat all over.  i know exactly how you feel about the thighs rubbing together when you walk. so annoying, right? just remember it's part of being a shapely woman :)|`|YqdU6SS6aa	If you tone up, the muscle turns into fat. If you can go to the gym, there is this great machine that works that particular part of the leg. It's a lifesaver! ha! But if you can't, do resistance training as much as possible at home. Squats won't really target that area though...|`|vsFF88tLaa	Stand on a bench or something. Don't let you knee go past your toes. Stand on one leg, and let the other leg go down towards the ground. Do about 10. Switch legs, do about 10. 1-3 times a day. Lie on your side and lift the bottom leg up, and don't let it touch the ground. Do about 10, switch legs, 1-2 times a day. Good-luck :)|`|pt6wIlS1aa	Walking and climbing stairs helps to tone up the inner thighs. Depending on how much effort you put into it, you can notice some difference in as little as a week or two.
17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	yeah, there is DEFINITELY a link between bullying and mental illnesses. bullying makes you feel like you're worthless - it leads to depression (or even suicide in some cases). sometimes the bullying can be so bad that it affects you on a subconscious level - it affects you in ways you don't even consciously realize.    my sister was bullied on several occasions when we were growing up, and now she suffers from severe depression and anxiety too. so i know where you're coming from. and good for you for seeing a therapist and getting some help :)|`|4yrqRS4qaa	ptsd would there as one of the first disorders from the traumatic and long term bullying.|`|e4tvh1d2aa	well i dont know your past  but if you are taking medications  it is partly a medical issue and not totaly a mental    it is not uncommon for peopel to get low self esteem after trama  like that.  you were bullied because they saw you as weaker  and the fact that you lost time after time  reenforced that    but now is the time to move on from that  just keep seeing your therapist,they understand your situation better  good luck|`|fscgp7iFaa	Bullying can cause all sorts of things the depression comes from the bullying because some people commit suicide because of it. bipolar is like mood swings which could happen if you're upset about it and then angry. It could be the bullying but it could be other stuff too|`|AA12252260	1. Possibly. Your mind can affect your body.   2. Because you let it eat you so much for so long. Your mind may be at peace (which is good), but now your body has to catch up.  3. I can't answer this without knowing your behavior, i.e. I need a little more info. Do you easily flip-flop between moods.|`|ExBaodthaa	i don't know if bullying is linked to the illnesses but let me tell you...  i think that those pills that they give people for depression screws them up even more.  I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago and i took medication for a while and i just wasn't myself.  Time heals emotional issues.|`|mdzuqUCaaa	You may have always had anxiety and have been bi polar (its hard to tell in children) and the kids bullying you picked up on that, which made you an easy target.    so maybe its the mental illness that caused the bullying.    I know it seems odd but children are very attune to other children's differences and will attack any sign of weakness like your a wounded animal.|`|2oFJIibRaa	I honestly think people that say this stuff are just looking for a excuse to do whatever the f ck they want and have people feel sorry for them.  I know lots of people including myself who had a crappy childhood and trust me it was alot worst that being bullied but we turned out fine.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	In some cases yes.

U9EwARTKaa	yup i have the exact same problem, i forget what the ingredient is but they use it in a lot of acne products. look for one of the main ingredients. stop using this product and the bumps will clear away. the next time you buy something for your acne just put a little on your chest or something, that way you will know if ur allergic to it or not(depending if theres a rash there the next day)  hope this helps :)|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	I've seen it before.  Stop using the product immediately.  You must have sensitive skin and it must not be for you.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	jump in the shower to wash the product off, use benedryl for a few days -pill & cream, and follow up with your dermatologist.
7Z3hWNewaa	Not particularly. If you took the morning after pill the actual morning after coitus you should be fine. Only time will tell though. If you're really worried go out and get a pregnancy test and take it in a week or so.    Do consider taking a daily birth control pill. This will put your mind at ease much better than Plan B. It's Plan "B" for a reason.|`|y5WPZ8dJaa	Nope! Plan B works very effectively.    Also, don't be afraid if your period is delayed or heavier/lighter than usual. Plan B tends to mess up your period right after you take it.|`|wscyjkPAaa	Depends.  If you took it too late, it may not work.  If you followed the instructions then there's nothing to worry about.  If you don't get your period for a month then its time to see a doctor.|`|IdUENGLxaa	if u took it less than 72 after conception,(the day u got pregnant)  then most likely no,  but the Plan B pill is 89 percent effective,  the sooner you take it the more likely it worked.    but im sure you are ok, maybe u should get a clear blue pregnancy test to be sure|`|ez2tlSvJaa	I think you shouldn't worry that happened to me to i even went to the doctors office but he said i wasn't pregnant that it was probably Just a delay but you shoud really consider the depo shot to prevent further un wanted pregnancy's.

Still, there are some cases where it happens, one would have to assume that some peoples...errr...organs are maybe more succeptable to these effects then others.    If smoking and loss of erection are things that you notice going hand and hand, you should probably continue to quit smoking.

vwjeG8n7aa	I could write a book about answering your question here, but I am going to just address two things here.  One up your protein 1 to 1.5 per a pound and 3 grams of carbs per a pound of weight.  Second you want your bench to go up.  Power movements deadlift, squat and wide grip pull-ups.  Next I want you to do lockouts.  Put a bench in a squat rack and adjust the safety bars so they are about ? away up from your chest.  Do a couple of warm up sets on the normal bench first.  Next go into the cage and bench the bar.  This works great for points in your bench where you get stuck at.  You should be able to do 315.  Next week lower the safety bars one notch.  I suggest 10x3 set and rep|`|kZdyPspmaa	I think you've hit a plateau.  Check out Men's Health on-line for some great pointers.|`|oPNGEjeSaa	I know how you feel. I CANNOT get past the 240 lb. max bench mark. However, I just found that your muscles get used to the workout that you do, if you do the same ones regularly after a while. Try changing your workouts, reps, and sets. Confuse your muscles, because if you've been doing bench every other day for 6 weeks, they are used to the bench, and they won't grow as much. keep switching it up.|`|IrnHxv0iaa	I would like to tell you that it is all a psychological game... when I was 15 I could only do 165, but one day my brother said that that is what it was,but it was really 185! well I put it up 2 times and couldn't believe so just try to trick yourself.|`|Ow7I1J1gaa	You should be eating more than three meals a day it should be more like six because you've got to get your metabolism going.

6nDqvtwbaa	Well....what is a "normal relationship" anyways?  I wish someone would have convinced me that sex before marriage is not a good thing before it was too late.    Don't sweat the kissing too much, I think.  If your boyfriend REALLY loves you he will be patient and understanding.  Passionate kissing can be quite dangerous anyways as it leads to more arousal usually for both.    Physical intimacy is best when done with the person you really want to share your life with.  Maybe just try and get used to a short quick kiss anyways.  If that  seems even too hard to kiss on the lips, let him kiss you on the cheek anyways.      Be patient with yourself, believe it or not, you are still quite young.  You've got plenty of time.  If he really loves you, he will be patient with you, too.    That one first guy was a real jerk...I guess if you were my sister I would have told you to sock him a good one.  There are some gentlemen out there so remember that...not all guys are as big a jerk as that.|`|rcRoF7WNaa	There's too much expectation for "firsts" kissing, sex, whatever.    When you kiss a guy you REALLY like for the first time, that will be special and make your knees wobble.

Not my fault, by the way...|`|j5o5qYmpaa	That guy was being a "jerk" kissing is the best thing in the word   I live for kissing and no i don't shove my tongue down her throat  just get in a liplock with a "sweet" guy

Braces are the way to go or if you have a few extra bucks, ask your Dentist about Invisalign.. You may not need to go w/ braces all over again. Ask your Dentist
gIMZaY02aa	Assuming they grow in straight and emerge completely, you probably won't NEED to have them removed.  That's not to say they won't cause you discomfort, however.    Definitely ask your dentist about it next time you're in.  I believe there are more complications to consider, such as them pushing on your other teeth as they grow in.|`|p3L7lt4Caa	depends on which one and if you've had braces or not...your top wisdom teeth grow in straight so most of the time it's ok to leave those in however your bottom wisdom teeth grow in at an angle because your jaw curves up at the back so those are very likely to crowd and shift your bottom teeth...i say go to a dentist and get an x-ray and see what they think!

If the craving doesnt stop i have no other choice but then to start using nicotine gums to prevent me from smoking. Hopefully that works.    Patches normally helped me to stop the craving however that was about 2 years ago because of my asthma was getting worst after each puff of air i breathed.

BI8c6XXPaa	Go to your doctor again and ask. Does it hurt during the process, like the friction of his penis rubbing against the vaginal walls, or is it every time he goes deep. If it is like a cramping every time he goes deep, tell the doctor about it, because it is a symptom of endometriosis. Before you let that scare you, make sure you talk to your doctor and rule it out.    If it hurts while he rubs against the walls, try relaxing a little more. Even if you are afraid it will start to hurt, force yourself to relax and then it will start hurting. What sometimes happens is if you are afraid of the pain, the vaginal muscles will contract making it really tight in there and causing pain. Kind of a catch 22, huh?    Good luck, and if it continues, let your doctor know again, and make him listen.

97e0754a3b24baa1ae3cc1400e2d95daaa	The clicking is the sound of your TMJ disk squeezing between the surfaces of your joint. Normally, it is pulled forward by a small muscle in synchrony with the opening of your mouth, but sometimes it can get jammed, and/or the restraining ligaments get stretched.  Once you have developed this problem, it will always be present, and flare up at certain times. You must NOT continue to aggravate it by wide opening such as eating burgers/apples/ yawning etc at full stretch. If you do aggravate it, then it will only get more frequent, and eventually probably cause pain.  There is NO CURE for this problem. Occlusal splints will help reduce the severity of the problem, but CANNOT UNDO the damage that you will cause.  I used to crack my jaw as a "trick" when I was in my teens, and it has haunted me ever since. About 10 years back it seized up on me for about 3 months - it was very uncomfortable.

UZ2FZzsjaa	Hi Limin, i hope this answers your question,  A major factor in the appearance of acne is abnormal hormone levels, which usually occurs during puberty. For women the level of testosterone, known as the male hormone, rise during the menstrual cycle, that may lead to acne out breaks, due to the fact that the subcutaneous gland producing more oil at this time. Hormone levels can also alter during pregnancy and menopause, making acne out breaks common.    When symptoms are noticeable medical care is recommended, in order to prevent scarring, that can last a life time, that can occur from chronic acne. Once a dermatologist has diagnosed the skin condition, an individual treatment series can begin. This can include lotions, cleansers, laser therapy, photodynamic therapy or acne pills.    The acne pill is actually the birth control pill, but has been shown to be effective some times, to correct hormone levels. Everyone has both male and female hormones, excessive testosterone levels, the male hormone, as well as the androgens, cause the sebaceous glands to go into over production, leading to acne out breaks. The acne pill, which are synthetic forms of estrogen and progestin can help level out these hormone levels, and have been shown to stop the ovaries from producing excess testosterone, and reinstating normal male and female hormone levels.    The effects of the acne pill will not be seen immediately after beginning this treatment, and in some cases acne can get worse before getting better. As soon as the acne pill starts to equate hormone levels out the benefits will be able to be seen. Some times one acne pill will not work, and actually cause more problems, so another acne pill needs to be tried. There are different types of acne pills for the different hormonal levels of different people.    People who suffer from chronic acne need to understand that the acne pill is a temporary cure, and in most cases, when the medication is stopped the acne will return. In some cases the acne can be far more serious after the acne pill is not being taken.|`|S730dpLfaa	I warn you about it.

I don't know you or what kind of relationship your in, but if you are in a long term relationship my guess would be that the guy really likes you or maybe even loves you and the fact that you have acne really doesn't come in to it.  So I would keep with the pill and try an alternative method (see the link I found in the resource box).       Being a guy myself and having a daughter I really don't trust boys or men full stop to bring their own contraception, even when I got engaged and married my wife was on the pill until we had the children.     After that I had a vasectomy and my wife could stop taking the pill and I know its hard to put up with the embarrassment of acne but remember you are beautiful and one of a kind, you are special and this is only a temporary thing.|`|887cdB42aa	Dunno. It would help to know what kind of pills they are. I use anti-bacterial pills just to keep my acne under control, I only take em when i get a breakout or something.

aLR7vXfcaa	I trust that anyone trying to get an IPhone isn't gonna try to kill themselves..(i hope LOL) so i can maybe answer this ..there doesn't seem to be an exact formula for over-dosage vs weight. Since you seem to have been on it for a while (sorry to hear that) you have prolly built up quite a tolerance and are obviously not sensitive to it. I wouldn't mess around with anything more than double what your prescribed tho (i understand chronic pain and YES sometimes you need one every 4 hours instead of every 8 for example) If that doesn't treat the pain effectively then its time to talk to your prescribing doctor and try something new. Also if your needing to take a higher dose of the hydrocodone then maybe look into getting something that doesn't have the acetaminophen in it, believe it or not that is more harmful than the hydrocodone in the long run.

Focus on your upper chest and used mind-muscle connection, followed by mid and lower chest. Aim around 10-15 reps on each set. I actually go really high reps when I'm pumping iron. Don't listen to people that say you can't grow on high reps, that's a bunch of bull. Cable-crossover and dips are important too, it's give your chest a complete look, more rounded.

Its fromt he weight loss. When you lose weight you lose muscle, minerals and vitamins. Do you stress alot?  I have all the same symptoms as you plus ihave muscle and bone aches and i can also feel all my lymph nodes!!  Doctors cant find anything worng with me. Im nealry 19 and had a baby 6 months gao. I was vitamin d defiecnt during my pregnancy but its back on track now but may be the cause.  Have a full blood examinationa nd a complete blod count. Or just see your doctor and first they probly check your red and white cells and your thyroid function.    Are you eating properly? Drinking enough water?
zz6VcUewaa	iits means to burn more calories than you eat. like a woman who does no exercise at all should eat 1,200 calories a day. and she would be able to maintain her weight. but if she were to eat 1,200 calories a day and lets say jog everyday she would lose weight.|`|vQsuxmmuaa	Yes, but remember the Basal Metabolic Rate too.  That basically states that your body burns calories at rest.  You can calculate it here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/</a>  Don't worry, you actually burn a LOT just sitting doing nothing, since your body does do a lot subconsciously.  A rule of thumb: If you want to lose weight, burn more calories than you take in(caloric deficit). If you want to gain muscle/weight, eat slightly more calories than you take burn( caloric surplus), but have it be in healthy foods with a good balance of protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats.|`|Q6euzOmVaa	excess calories turn to fat. If you eat 1000s of calories all the time and sit on your butt, it will turn to fat. You aren't exercising 2000 calories worth each day. you burn some calories just by living.<br>  <br>  the trick is smaller portions / cut out junk food / cut back on sugar / exercise / MODERATION|`|tIldpr7vaa	yes, if u wanna lose weight<br>  <br>  Just know thats not all from working out, you burn calories all day
Tswfs7qGaa	Feeling sore and stretched is normal.  And depending on what you mean by feeling like you're going to start your period, that may also be normal.    Your "cherry" and your hymen are the same thing.  Not all girls bleed after having sex the first time.    As for were you good, did he enjoy it, and did you satisfy him you need to ask him that.    When you say he "got up and was done", does that mean he like put his clothes back on and left or what?|`|QgxoeIR3aa	my girlfriends cherry poped when i took her v card almoset puked she panicked but she was fine she did not feel sore though after the first time we did it maby u should see a ginocolagist or however its spelled out how old are u.

Also, its possible you only bled a little but didnt notice.  As for the rest of it, I wouldn't worry too much about whether or not he was pleased.  Losing your virginity will be something you will always remember I think the more important thing is for you to be happy with the whole experience.  And he probably got up when he was "done" because he wanted to clean himself up.  And if you really are concerned about the experience, ask him about it.  Ask him his opinion, you are grown right?  No harm in communicating!! lol

You are born with Dyspraxia and the symptoms are: clumsiness,  motor skills are slow. Hard to take in what your teacher tries to teach you, and a few other symptoms. This disorder is mostly a disease that affects boys. You can find out more by going to google.  I've had fms for 10 yrs. now. The pain runs from my shoulders to the bottom of my feet and is excruciating. It does affect my motor skills, cause whenever I try doing anything I go into painful spasms. And I'm on very strong pain medications.  I really hope you're not experiencing this.  So, I hope this has been helpful for you.  Take care!

Byq9QDagaa	Tooth brushing alone eliminates some of the bacteria in the mouth. However recent studies show that most odor-causing bacteria is found on the tongue. The combination of brushing and tongue scraping eliminates up to 55% more odor-causing bacteria than tooth brushing alone.    Try to carry with you a tongue cleaner and an alcohol-free mouthrinse, this is easier and quicker than brushing,and will keep your breath fresh longer.

3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	I think 30 degrees Celsius translates to 86 degrees Fahrenheit. That's pretty hot. Where I am in Minnesota, USA, it has been around -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius) or colder for the past 2 months. I've been having a hard time too.    To answer you question, cotton clothes are supposed to be cooler as they wick away perspiration better. Light colored clothes are cooler because they reflect the sun's radiant heat away from you better. If you can carry around a water bottle and wet some part of your clothes that touches your skin and where it doesn't look too bad, as the wet or damp clothes dry, they act like a little refrigerator.    Do you have to stay on school grounds? If there is any place where you can be social that is air conditioned, you might want to hang out there. If you have to be in the heat and there is a source of running water, if you let cold water run over your forearms for 5 to 15 minutes it will really cool you off.     There is a lot of blood in your forearms. The cold water will make the blood there cold and your heart will pump this colder blood all over your body, making all of you cooler. Don't let yourself get too cold though.    Getting enough salt is helpful. When you perspire your perspiration has salt in it. If you don't replace the salt that you lose in your perspiration, your body will feel bad and you can even get sick. When I was in the Air Force and somewhere that was above 100 degrees Fahrenheit every day, they would give us salt tablets and tell us to take them every day to keep our energy up. If you put salt in tomatoe juice or something like that and drank it, maybe that would be enough salt for you.    I think that it's stupid for your school to not let you wear hats in the summer! You can tell them I said so! Wearing a white or light colored hat in the summer can help you feel and be much cooler.    I'm sorry that you are having such a hard time. I hope that something that I have written is helpful.|`|ZGhjYrlFaa	There really isn't a lot you can do... I mean, you can't change the fact that it's hot! Maybe think about getting an air-con for when u get home?  Today, where i live, in Australia, it was 112 F / 45 C... Now THATS hot!|`|xFdz9CMKaa	30C is actually 86F.  It commonly gets over 90F and over 100F during the summer all the time.  So I'm used to it.  I don't know how humid it gets in Australia, but here in the summer it is EXTREMELY humid, which makes the temperature feel 10-20 degrees warmer than it already is.  A dry (no humidity) heat in a desert of 86F feels fantastic, if you ask me.

Exercises like running, tie-bo, and areobics are designed to reduce weight, so stick to things that cause "Muscle Failure," like push-ups.

2aEU1lmpaa	I've been on Synthroid since 1999.  I don't know how long you've been going through this but it does take time to get your dosage dialed in.  The problem is there is such a large range for "normal" and some doctors just won't discuss adjusting your dosage if you fall within this range.  If you've been taking medication for more than a year and still feel this way and your doctor won't adjust the dose, see another doctor.   You have to be the person who decides what is "normal" for you.    I wish you much luck.
7HxJvbjMaa	Gargle with warm saltwater several times a day. The warm saltwater will be very soothing and promote healing.<br>  Avoid spicy or crunchy foods, stick to soft bland foods until the burn heals.|`|7UAz8wrsaa	Try cold drinks, and ice|`|FnMH7tREaa	the best thing you can do is rinse with salt water. 1 teaspoon per one cup of water. just swish it around for 10-20 seconds after you eat or brush your teeth. that is what the dentist had me do when they pulled out ALL 4 of my wisdom teeth at once. it sounds like it will hurt, but it actually is soothing and it really helps the healing process.you may also want to use a toothpaste that doesn't have sodium lauryl sulfate(SLS) in it.(try tom's of maine sls-free toothpaste)  SLS is a corrosive irritant and has been proved to cause cold sores, so it really wouldn't be good to use it near an injured area! i hope you feel better soon!

That needs to be from a combination of exercise and changing the way you eat.  But I do not like the word diet!<br>  <br>  You need a good combination of aerobic activity and resistance training combined with a healthy diet.<br>  <br>  It is not recommended to lose more than 1-3 lbs a week. If you want to lose weight the correct and safe way that will stay off for the long-term you need a good exercise and nutrition plan.<br>  <br>  A good program looks like this:<br>  <br>  Always warm up and cool down<br>  <br>  Muscular strength & endurance-you need a good resistance training program that includes exercises for all muscle groups(hips, chest, upper and mid back, legs (quads and hamstrings), shoulders, lower back, upper arms (biceps and triceps), calves, forearms, abdomen, and the gluteus maximus).<br>  Your intensity should be 70-80% 1-RM or 8-12-RM, 8-12 reps, 1 or more sets, 3 times a week for 6 weeks or more. You should begin with 1 exercise for each major muscle group and make sure the days you do resistance training are not consecutive meaning you don't exercise the same muscle group two days in a row. As you continue your program you can add more exercises, add weight, and change up your program to include more days or just work specific muscle groups on specific days. As your muscles grow stronger you will be able to reduce the rest time between each set. You should rest for about 30 seconds between sets. Muscle is metabolically active and therefore when you gain muscle it burns more calories and helps to raise your metabolism.<br>  If you do not have money for a gym membership or do not have acess to one here is a great website to create a work out plan only using your body weight.<br>  <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/exercises.php?MainMuscle=&Equip=BodyOnly&Isolation=" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/exercise...</a><br>  You can also search for all kinds of exercises that use weight.<br>  <br>  Cardiovascular Endurance-this is where you can burn fat the most and that leads to enhancing your muscles such as the abs.

Most people focus on only weight, but you should not put as much focus on that as much as what your body fat percentage is (get it tested at an exercise facility with skinfold calipers). You should also get circumference measurements done. This includes your neck, shoulder, chest, waist, abdominal, hip (buttocks), thigh (proximal), thigh (mid), thigh (distal), knee, calf, ankle, arm (bicep), forearm, and wrist. You should be able to do this at a gym. You should get all of this information done before you start your program and then you can see how you improve.<br>  <br>  Flexibility- Most people do not even think about this, but it is very important because it helps to prevent injury and it helps you to perform every day activities. It also has an effect on all your other programs. You should perform 10-12 flexibility exercises every day. Slowly stretch the muscle to a point of mild discomfort but not necessarily pain. Hold stretch for 10-30 seconds, and do 3-5 reps for each stretch. This should take about 15-30 minutes per session.

Are you extremely over weight...or just want to lose a few pounds.  Another thing, if you are just looking at in the short run for a 2 week period...Any weight you lose will be water weight, and more than likely you are going to gain that back plus some.  I have had to battle my weight my entire life.  I have managed to lost 60 pounds since January.  First of all...DIET...along with exercise...are obviosuly the two most important components.  I would recommend you eat under 1500 calories everyday and consume half of your body weight in water.  For ex. ( a 140 pound person would need to drink 70 oz of water)...You also should either walk, or run.  Fitness activity is crucial.  I would adivse that you do it atleast 4 days a week...and you WILL lose weight if you do this...Like I said though, if you don't stick to it and modify it...your going to gain it all back plus some...Think in terms of Lifestyle Changes...Hope I helped...|`|AA10448709	Water.

ZgaBUns4aa	Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, those being the air passages that extend from the windpipe into the lungs.This is a breathing disorder.     Its symptoms are:   1. Larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes are acutely inflamed.  2. Excess mucus secretion.  3. Difficulty in breathing and deep chest cough.    Some natural treatments for bronchitis are as follows:  1. Mixture of dried ginger powder, pepper should be taken three times a  day.  2. Use of Onions.  3. Turmeric powder.  4. Doing some exercises in the fresh air, etc.    For more information you can try the link    http://www.naturaltreatmentsite.com/bron...|`|UZxeBrxQaa	The only natural treatment for bronchitis I know of is time, pain, suffering, and possibly death from pneumonia.

You wait to long you will start coughing up blood.  Bronchitis is worse when you lay down at night, you need antibiotics no home cure for this.

It typically lasts a few weeks (maybe 2 to 4.) In some people it's chronic, coming back over and over again.    Not positive about "natural" treatments. Bronchitis is an inflammatory infection. Antibiotics are often prescribed to fight it off and keep it from getting worse. Sometimes steroids are prescribed to help with the inflammation. Cough medication can be prescribed often, as well.
iZEAJGK3aa	most people will tell you that you cant gain or lose weight in certain parts of your body. this isn't true if you do everything correctly. though you need to look at your genes also. if you mother or aunt is thin and bony you may be damned.   the only woman i know who wanted a bigger butt and stayed thin while getting it, was taking estrogen. she got her curves, but was working out constantly. she also got larger breasts and thighs, but was nolonger a stick figure.|`|TUGNFxydaa	how you put on weight is heavily dependent on your genes.  everyone gains weight differently and at different rates, so your best course of action it gym exercises that will focus on the muscles in your hips thighs and butt. even that's not a guarantee you will come out looking like you want to.

97e0754a3b24baa1ae3cc1400e2d95daaa	Arestin (minocycline hydrochloride) is an antibiotic used as a supplement to scaling and root planing procedures for reduction of pocket depth in patients with adult periodontitis. It DOES NOT REPLACE the need for scaling and root planing procedures.  Typically, hand instruments (scalers, curettes) are used to clean around and under the gum. Lasers can almost do the same job, but are unable to reach between tooth roots as well as hand instruments, lasers do not do a better job, and they take more time. Plus, they are very expensive pieces of equipment to buy, and this cost must be passed on to the patients.  None of the gum specialists (periodontists) to whom I refer patients uses a laser.

FYUHJyvpaa	Well, some people have expressed reluctance to engage in sports, precisely because there is a requirement to run a number of miles for a while, but otherwise will not be any good. It is not true. You just need to become much more active in your daily life. It is much more realistic, more feasible and therefore more effective. But is it? To begin with - yes. Further increases in physical activity will depend on the speed of metabolic processes in your body and how much fat you need to lose. The gradual increase in workload is quite available, so let's stop for some councils, which should begin.    Try to start the day with a morning cocktail. Nourishing, low, with a lot of fiber, it will help to quickly clear the body, long and still hunger for a month to get rid of the excess of three kilograms. The recipe for it is simple: a cup of any fruit (can be frozen), tablespoon soy, apple juice and a few cubes of ice.|`|7y63ZzK4aa	eat food

ETcBRko3aa	People with Bipolar disorder have mood episodes that flucuate between highs and lows.    Bipolar 1 has episodes of mania and depression. Most episodes last for long periods of time, like weeks or months. For example, I had a depressive episode that lasted 5 months and required hospitalization.    Bipolar 2 has episodes of hypomania and depression. Hypomania is not full-blown mania, but more of a feel-good feeling.    Manic symptoms:  Increased activitty  Spending alot of money of thing you don't need  Having alot of sex  Talking fast  Not sleeping  Doing crazy things  Driving fast    Depressive symptoms:  Wanting to die  sleeping  eating alot or too little  crying spells    These are NOT simple mood swings, but are episodes that are very distinct.  There is a "rapid-cycling" diagonsis where people go from high to low to high to low more quickly, but this is rare.    And the above person is WRONG.  Sometimes when Bipolar people are manic, they DO NOT remember things they have done.  I was arrested once when I was manic for doing something I barely remember doing.  They hospitalized me and got my meds fix.|`|KhS39gLqaa	nope. people suffering from bipolar disorder remember their episodes. you're no bipolar chic-a-dee. you're lucky haha! i think that you were probably just kind of zoning out and your subconscious mind was talking for you. whether your conscious mind agrees with your subconscious mind or not, you had that feeling in you somewhere. just don't worry about it babe and you'll be fine.|`|xRZnJAzlaa	it might also be called mood swings.. changing emotions so rapidly.. it makes people behave strange..  usually they need a little therapy.|`|rbUXsgDBaa	I have to agree that you don't sound bipolar.

I'm German, Irish, English, Caucasian, red hair (this week!) and very fair skinned and areas you are questioning have always been a sort of dusty pink. I've never been pregnant but when I was on oral contraceptives, the nipples did turn slightly browner. That's because the pill fools your body into thinking it is pregnant, so those little "side effects" are to be expected. When I went off the pill, I noticed everything started to revert to it's original color.    Wish the body came with an owner's manual.    You sound like an enchanting "mix"!

Shrimp does not have chemicals in it.  It is made up of proteins and fat vitamins and minerals.  Period    Asetenic is a made up word.  Acetic acid is vitamin C.    There is no way to be explained no possibility it could happen.  Unless the shrimp was alive and took out the broad with a switchblade going down her throat....    A bad mix of 'chemical stuff' in the shrimp?  Unless she was poisoned, deliberately or accidentally and hemorrhaged it is impossible for anything like that to happen with natural foods.  All combinations of foods have been tried again and again.    Vitamin C is inert and is not toxic especially diluted as in a beverage.

9EdJHqKHaa	It is very common to have irregular periods when you are young. This is nothing to be concerned about. It takes awhile for your body to get on a normal schedule.

WupyR6UEaa	I had to get a night guard.  You can buy them at any drug store.  You boil hot water, put the guard in and leave in for what the directions say, each one is different.  When you take it out, you put it in your mouth and bite down.  It will make an imprint of your bite.  There are different sizes, make sure you get the right size for your mouth.  You might want to ask the pharmacist which one they like better.  Cost is about $10.  Or if you want to spend about $500 and have the dentist make one for you.  Insurance does not cover them, so it would be out of your pocket.  I would try the over the counter ones first.    Rx Tech|`|AKv1gj0Xaa	If this is an ongoing problem, your dentist can prescribe a plastic mouth guard that you wear at night to protect your teeth.    People develop grinding habits for a lot of reasons, but often because of stress. Sometimes the problem stops of its own accord. You definitely want to get it taken care of; constant grinding can lead to expensive dental work and premature tooth loss.|`|AA10980192	teeth guard grinding , google it.|`|ujs7u7J7aa	Go see your dentist and tell him that you grind you teeth.    I actually was not aware that I grind my teeth and my dentist was the one who told me.    She made up a small plastic mouth guard called a "night guard" and it prevents you from being able to grind you teeth.    They are quite comfortable and work really well.  I used to wake up with headaches all the time and the dentist told me that grinding your teeth at night can cause this.  True enough - when I started using the night guard my morning head aches stopped.    She also told me that if I didn't do something about it I would eventually wear down my teeth so much that the enamel would be gone and I would basically have to have those teeth removed due to the damage.    Go see a dentist and discuss it with them.

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	I agree with Mary. In fact, the only type of physical therapy that has been shown to have lasting results in those with FM is increasing cardiovascular activity. Massage might give some temporary benefits, but since it's temporary, it really isn't used in PT much any more.      At the real heart of the matter, fibromyalgia is a condition where the pain-response cycle has become abnormal and neurotransmitter and neuropeptide production and transmission is not normalized.      Increasing cardiovascular condition helps to normalize neurotransmitter production. Also, as Mary said, an aquatic based program is often preferred by people with FM.    In my opinion, most physicians (even surgeons, rheumatologists and even physiatrists) have a very poor understanding of current concepts in physical therapy.  They might be excellent medical practicioners, but their understanding of PT is often very minimal and outdated.    If your doctor wants you to have massge, I'd simply see a massage therapist. But realize that massage is a "maintence" procedure and will most likely not be covered by insurance (even if it was done by a PT).|`|W1tx1p2iaa	There is no difference in PT.  PT is PT.  No fibro PT.  I would suggest that you see a PT who has treated fibro before.  A place with a therapeutic pool is helpful    For a referral talk to a fibro pt who has goon to PT.    BEst wishes|`|AubmEoYgaa	I don't know what you have been told about fibromyalgia, but knots in the upper back muscles is not fibromyalgia. My wife has suffered with the condition for years. I heard a Doctor explain fibromyalgia in a way that I could understand. He said if you take a piece of meat like a steak and lay it on the counter, you will see these white streaks through the meat. With fibromyalgia, those white streaks, which is also in your muscles, began to harden. If I were to take my finger a flick it against my wife's muscle anywhere, she would scream with pain. A good Chiropractor would be able to help those knots in your back. They would first take an x-ray, then they will lay you on a table and give you what they call a micro dine treatment which is electrical vibrations directly into where the knots are. There is something you can try  at home but will need help in doing it. You lay on your stomach in bed, have someone place towels that have been soaked wit hot water and rung out, where you are hurting. This is moist heat and is the best kind. After doing this with several towels, have them take their thumbs and start up those back muscles until they find a knot. Have them apply pressure right on the knot and hold. It will hurt you but when being done but afterwards you will feel better. When they are pushing on the knot it will begin to quiver, which is loosening up, Once that quivering stops, have them massage the knot area and apply some Aspercreme. You should do this at least twice a day. You should also have a muscle relaxer pill like Soma,, which will make you a little sleepy, but wil relax mucles. For exercising of the fibromyalgia, my wife would go to the Community indoor facility, and exercise her legs and arms in the heated pool. I wish for you the very best young lady and good luck on getting some needed relief. I hope they did test you to make sure that you have the fibromyalgia.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	i went to PT for Fibro-its the same as otehr PT--they should do a lot of stretching and gentle aerobic exercise-    they don't massage-you have to pay a massage tehrapist for taht    make sure tehy really know what fibro is  (a neuro disorder)    it is true that fibro causes stiffness--and yu can getknots form inactivity---but fibro does NOT cause any physical changes to teh body-such as knots    bes ure you really have fibro as many docs overdiagnosie (and some refuse to diagnose it)-    many docs think it is  a genral term for pain and stiffness-not its own disease

Invisalign will only correct minor misaligned teeth, and requires your compliance to wear constantly as directed.  Braces can correct a much, much wider range of misalignments, and will do the work for you without you having to think about it.  Get an opinion from an orthodontist, and not from a general dentist as to what is best for your particular situation.|`|FmKsR3lNaa	If you don't mind the look, bracers are the cheaper option but can be a bit more painful.    Invisalign costs a little more, but it is nearly invisible, and can be removed when you need to clean your teeth etc.
1LPvMbXAaa	If the bridge can be attached to your existing teeth, then the dentist will need to grind them down for the bridge to be attached.    If the damage to your teeth is not deep, then you can compare it to having a cavity drilled out. If you need root canal treatment, then the work is a bit more extensive as the dentist has to kill and remove the root, fill the tooth and build a foundation for the crowns to be attached to.    You will get anesthesia injections to numb the area, but nobody can answer you how much it will hurt as it depends on how sensitive you are to pain and the structure of the nerves, roots and bone. For some it will feel a bit uncomfortable others may say it is painful, so the best answer is that you should compare it to your own experience with having fillings and root canal treatment done (if you have not had root canal, then compare it to the most extensive and most uncomfortable filling you have had done).    Personally, I feel the pain no matter how many injections I get, so for me the anesthesia only takes the edge off.

That way you have rid yourself of whatever was in there and potentially causing it.  Once you've done that you can try a little natural ginger in the form of candied ginger, tea, natural ginger ale, capsule or extract.  If that doesn't work you can try sipping on strong peppermint tea.    Of course it is never safe to use essential oils internally as many of them are extremely toxic but one time I had the dry heaves really bad and couldn't hold down water or anything.  I put one drop of pure organic essential oil of peppermint in a glass of cool water and sipped it.  I was immediately able to hold down water and two hours later was able to eat.

The same with doing push ups, you'll only hurt your chest.<br>  <br>  Break it down;<br>  Mon - Rest<br>  Tues - Core + Chest<br>  Wed - Rest<br>  Thurs - Core + Chest<br>  Fri - Stretching<br>  Sat - Core + Chest<br>  Sun - Jogging / Skipping<br>  <br>  Plenty of carbs + protein.<br>  <br>  Look after your body.<br>  All the best|`|XoSqjbWEaa	yeah but make sure you take one day off every week and maybe if you have a trampoline replace that with jogging|`|OkmcBGBqaa	Mike Geary, a professional trainer suggests this;<br>  <br>  Most people stick to workouts where they do something along the lines of 3 sets of 10-12 reps per exercise, with 2-3 minutes rest between sets. Booooorrrrring!!!! <br>  Here are a few examples of different methods to spice up your routine. <br>  ? Try 10 sets of 3, with only 20 seconds rest between sets. <br>  ? Try using a fairly heavy weight and complete 6 sets of 6 reps, doing a 3 minute treadmill sprint between each weight lifting set. <br>  ? Try using a near maximum weight and do 10 sets of 1 rep, with only 30 seconds rest between sets. <br>  ? Try using a lighter than normal weight and do 1 set of 50 reps for each exercise <br>  ? Try a workout based on only one full body exercise, such as barbell clean & presses or dumbbell squat & presses, and do nothing but that exercise for an intense 20 minutes. <br>  ? Try a workout based on all body weight exercises such as pushups, pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, body weight squats, lunges, up and down stairs, etc. <br>  ? Try a circuit of 12 different exercises covering the entire body without any rest between exercises. <br>  ? Try that same 12 exercise circuit on your subsequent workout, but do the entire circuit in the reverse order. <br>  ? Try your usual exercises at a faster repetition speed on one workout and then at a super-slow speed on your next workout. <br>  ? Try completing six 30 minute workouts one week, followed by three 1-hr workouts the next week. This will keep your body guessing. <br>  ? Try doing drop sets of all of your exercises, where you drop the weight between each set and keep doing repetitions without any rest until complete muscular fatigue (usually about 5-6 sets in a row). <br>  <br>  There are many more ways to continue to change your training variables. This was just a taste of your possibilities. Be creative and get results!

KegxJHn5aa	You should know, Dance Dance Revolution, and all of it's wonderful spin-offs, are actually video games. They're not real work-out simulations, so that Workout mode that they have. Yeah, totally unreliable. I'm glad you noticed that and turned away.    Anyways, it really is hard to measure an exact amount from a little workout simulation from a video game, but I can probably estimate a couple of things.    Your average person would probably burn ten calories or so by walking one-third of a kilometer, or one-fourth of a mile. So, assuming you're actually playing the game the way it is meant to be, then you would probably get about ten to twenty calories burned from five to six minutes played. If you add on extra activities, such as using your arms and flailing them around to the beat, the amount could increase significantly.    It really depends, but if you want a straight answer, then here it is.    Ten Calories Burned = Three Minutes of Play|`|R5LuKSUXaa	dude your like 11 years old........relax.  you don't need to be all workout crazy.  you are tiny.|`|DMjxbn3Jaa	IDK|`|j7OfrcD0aa	clint eastwood    (hah! i beat him to it)|`|249RAe7Saa	lol do u go to stonegate hi im josh lol

They are parasitic mites that burrow in your skin. You can only get them from close prolonged skin to skin contact with someone who is infected. To be sure ask yourself this:    Is the itching worse at night?    Has it spread?    Is the itch super intense and begin again once you stop scratching.    If you said yes to all then its probably scabies.    One of the things that you may notice is little blister like bumps on your hands and in the webbing of your fingers. These are called pauples. They itch and hurt. Scabies is contagious!! There is no over the counter medicine (believe me I tried). I thought it was bed bugs at first, but I tore my house apart and found none. It took 3 doctors to diagnose me. The medicine isn't cheap. $124.00 for the Lindane.

When I was younger I had an alergy to detergents used to wash my cothes and sheets as well. Try using All free and clear. It could also be because you brought bed bugs home from a recent trip. My brother had that happen to him when he went to a San Francisco buisness trip.  You may have dry skin as well--- try using a very moistrizing lotion (maybe even cortizone cream) before bed and put a portable humidifyer in your room. If the rash still persists I would see a dermatologist. good luck|`|DEMNQFecaa	i have the same problem but i think its crapss whatever that is.|`|V1rQs8T4aa	you probably have bedbugs.

In other words, you have to start thinking of your girlfriend as being just as bound by her illness as a double amputee is bound by their condition. That means making adjustments for her that you wouldn't for someone else who is 'normal'. Thus, your first dilemna is: do i want to make these adjustments? If the answer is no, you have an obligation to walk away because hanging around won't make either of you better.    If you answer yes, then your options get complicated. Because you will have to constantly make adjustments and ask that question (do I want to be here) every single day you are with her. There are no off-days for someone who is bi-polar, just as there are no off-days for someone who is a double-amputee. You stumble over it everywhere you go and in everything you do.    Medicine only masks the issue, it doesn't cure it. We can't grow new, happier childhood memories and coping skills for her to proceed from, which means that how she acted, in her manic and depressive states before, is most likely how she will react later.    Something else you need to know: mentally ill people have the psychological skin texture of wet tissues. If you breathe on them wrong, it brings up all sorts of deep emotional and psychological insecurities, so trying to confront her on your terms, and in your own skin, is actually not going to help her out at all. She will take those actions as you dismissing her, fueling her insecurities, making her act out even more during her manic phase. You ARE at fault, and though it's not in the way you think it is, that fault is no less real to her. This is what I mean by thinking of her as a double-amputee: what they can do normally, you let them do, but you don't expect them to be as normal and thus as accountable for their actions as everyone else. Again, this is part of that adjustment you as her bf need to make.    The best guide to helping the mentally ill is usually the patient themselves. Simply listening to them and taking what they say as being valuable (and worth paying attention to, respecting) is one of the best tools in any concerned person's arsenal. Prove to her that you care about what she feels and how she acts, and she will help you help her.

That added force will cause further bone loss and gum recession if the existing condition is not treated first.

6NZeItMAaa	There are many ways that you can deal with stress that do not involve using drugs or alcohol. As a matter of fact, you are better off if you can avoid any type of prescription drug for your stress. Stress can be managed by many different natural methods. <br>  <br>  The first thing that you need to do is to find out the cause of your stress. Once you have found the cause of your stress, you need to address this fact. The cause may be something that you can eliminate, or it can be something with which you have to live. <br>  <br>  If the cause of your stress is something over which you have no control, you need to evaluate the problem, face it and seek help. There are many different counseling methods that incorporate behavior techniques to address stress. Medication can be useful in some situations, but tranquilizes should never be a long term “cure” for stress. <br>  <br>  Natural cures for stress include behavior management techniques, proper diet and exercise, herbal remedies and yoga techniques. These will actually work towards alleviating your stress.|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	GOOOOOOZZZZZFRAAABAAAAAA|`|ivyHOwZUaa	Talk to a therapist who will refer you to a psychiatrist, you might have anxiety disorder.

EkdRA0qbaa	it can effect your liver big time.   it will *not* make you "immune" to medications, but it can make some medications last longer. your liver filters your blood, with liver damage - drug levels and alcohol can increase extremely because you liver can not metabolize it out.   it can kill you. i have seen people need liver transplants from taking too many pills.   its best to go to the doctor and have a liver panel blood test drawn so they can see how effectively your liver is working, how badly it may be damaged and what you will need to avoid or pay attention to. theres no good way to estimate it without seeing those numbers.   your body would not have thrown up all the pills - it would have absorbed a ton of them and then made you throw up when it finally realized your blood levels were toxic and you were getting sick.|`|8pLZr9mXaa	It all depends how long they were in your system before you vomited them.

Also check if your tongue is swollen mines are usually hard or soft when i get them. Look at yourself in the mirror and open your mouth check if your UVULA( the little ball that hangs behind your throat not the womens private part) is swollen or your or covered with white stuff. If not check the 2 glands(next to the uvula i forgot what they are called) to see if they are covered with white mucus if thats the case you might have a throat infection or is probably a sign of the flu or a serious strapped throat.    See a doctor or take some pain killers if it hurts you.|`|jb8RpJBIaa	I can feel lots of lumps un my neck, they are called lymph nodes.     Don't listen to the "its a swollen lymph node" as they don't have to be swollen for you to feel them, especially if you are slim, i wouldn't even bother with a doctor unless they are unmovable, hard/firm and are over 1cm...  if over 1cm but are squishy and tender then it is just part of your bodies way of fighting an infection.|`|lLs8tcU4aa	Does it sting?    It might be just an ulcer.|`|66ebcba85f2a6120fbb7b58bdb7a909eaa	could be lymph nodes...they "pick up" infection, and then they swell.  could be cold germs, teeth probs, many things.if you think the worst,   it COULD be cancer. sorry but it is a fact. glad you have appointments.|`|wrMmU3Asaa	It sounds like a lymph node. Does it hurt to swallow? Does it feel solid or loose? Have you recently had the flu or a bad cold? Sinus problems? You may need to be on antibiotics to treat it.

dZMHd5PMaa	well go to the doctor and see what they prescribe but I would say that an anti inflammatory like advil/ibuprofen would be good if you can't get to the doctor right away|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	A couple tylenol every 4 hours and rest.
6HO9NIuUaa	Depends on your goals.  The USDA recommends 0.8g per kilogram of body weight which is very very low.    If you're a growing guy interested in gaining muscle mass, shoot for a gram per pound of body weight.     Registered dietitians will say that eating a lot of protein could potentially be damaging to the kidneys but there are no studies concluding that (the studies done were with people who already had kidney problems).    I know body builders who eat about 300g per day, which is a bit excessive, so don't worry about the exact number except keep it over 100g.|`|KppM3VzAaa	To give a good answer we need more details.  It depends on what your health goals are.    Muscle and Weight Gain needs more than weightloss and wellness, let me know your height and weight and what you are looking to do then I can give you an answer!|`|GqfiRXu3aa	If you're a bodybuilder you should consume 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight.  So if you weigh 150 pounds, you should consume 150 grams of protein a day.|`|i1UxX72eaa	0.75g of protein for each kg of body weight. If you are an athlete, you will need more (about1.2-1.4g) tohelp build enough muscle.
t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|AA11304025	Why are you taking drugs?  You could have some damage to your arm -see your doctor|`|GoNCzxAuaa	It sounds like you might have a pinched nerve in your arm, but the fact that you are on a medication is a bit worrying.  It may be a side effect of the Effexor, so it would be beneficial to see your doctor.|`|DCfRc6GPaa	it sounds like it could be a circulatory problem.    Given that you are currently on medication, you should go to your doctor and see if it's a side effect of the medication, in which case he'll probably prescribe another. or it might just be a trapped nerve.

UE2fFzq7aa	Get a whitening toothpaste.  I think the ones by arm and hammer work the best and brush them twice and then brush with only water, kinda to polish them.    THEN.. use crest white strips.  They really do work.  Even my brother who is a dentist told me he thinks they work well.|`|FZGotEkAaa	A great product that I used was a free trial for an internet product called 'Teeth whiten tips' , using sort of special cotton tips to swab a gel onto the teeth. I used this for about 2 weeks ish and it lightened my teeth 3-4 shades based on the guidelines which wasn't bad for a free product.    I don't like the idea of using trays or strips because it involves leaving bleaching agents on your teeth. So the only other thing I can recommend is 'Blanx staing removing toothpaste' which works really well and intensly removes stains for the teeth, try googling it.|`|ZqJQblFUaa	A dentist is the best option|`|uVyj8kB3aa	If you wnt very fast results,an inoffice bleach is the best option,by the dentist.You can go for overnight bleach also,again by the dentist.Be very careful because over the counter products have abrasives which damage the tooth
UeKu0r6Uaa	have her see an allergist.  Do you have cats?|`|eu6UQElYaa	Well, I would say it's either asthma, which can easily be missed if you aren't having symptoms during the time that they check you or it's likely panic attacks.  Many many people have panic attacks at night, just before bed.   Truth be told, it sounds pretty much exactly like a panic attack.|`|28qmqsySaa	start with a regular Doctor  and ask about a specialist  but please go toa Doctor    smile  good luck|`|qfSKgxDsaa	She might have asthma.  Or stress induced asthma.  I suggest going to a doctor and getting an anti-anxiety medicine and an inhaler.|`|5i09rH7Taa	It could be Asthma, or Cystic Fibrosis, or panic attacks that have nothing to do with the bladder infections.  Stress can trigger panic attacks which can make you sick.  Asthma and CF can be breathing problems and people with CF get sick a lot.|`|11wcVc0Eaa	Thats how I am I have asthma and my asthma only seems to act up at night when im laying down .... It's hard for me to breath and I cough alot !!!|`|lrqjTm7naa	It sounds like anxiety or panic attacks.  But to be on the safe side, she should definitely see a doctor.  As for the bladder infection, she needs medical help, also.  You're thoughtful to ask a question like this on her behalf.
FmKsR3lNaa	This kind of depends on your age... once you reach about 15 years of age, tooth extraction won't really help with overcrowding, as your teeth become more fixed in their positions.|`|uVyj8kB3aa	You have not given details about what treatment you have undergone prior.I think extraction is not a very good idea.it will further create more problems like movement of other teeth in the extracted site,if there is place.Go back meet your orthodontist,if you have one, or search for a new one
0VBmZLZXaa	well i would think the lantus would be more convenient because it only needs to be taken once a day and you're covered.    you still need to bolus with short-acting but lantus is pretty awesome imo.    i dont unerstand much about how people use only short acting... like they must be injecting all the time to make sure they have basal insulin..|`|Lor20kXcaa	Depends on so many things.    It's perfectly safe from a chemical point.    Whether it will provide appropriate insulin for your child though is a completely different matter.    It depends on their lifestyle, their personalities, their exercise, control etc.    If you're having any concerns at all about your kids control though, call the doc.  Just for your peace of mind.|`|IPpOd2wmaa	I would check with the doctor, but, Lantus and Humalog are my saviors.  Lantus is good because it keeps you level all day, but, you have to take small  amounts of short acting insulin (humalog) when you eat, less carbs, less insulin though.  Humalog is the closest thing we have to human insulin and works like a charm...reacts in the same time period has human insulin. I would recommend getting him on that if its possible.  It seems to be easiest and safest I've come across in 19 years.|`|wJ5JnKLhaa	I'm not too sure if it's safe for a five year old... I mean, I'm not a doctor or anything, but I'm on Lantus, and I can't see anything about it that could be dangerous for a little kid.     From the practical perspective for long acting insulin only, it'd be good because you only have to have it once a day. But normally for someone on Lantus, you have between two and four injections of Novarapid or Humalog or something along the same lines.     To add a bit of real life to this, when I was seven and first diagnosed, I was put onto Protophane and Actrapid with only two needles a day.     To answer your question in short though, I would say that it should be safe for a five year old to have Lantus, but whether it's better for them...? I wouldn't know.|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Well, what I think is that it's a doctors decision to decide what and how much of any insulin a 5 1/2year old should be having.  Consult the childs doctor.  But yes, it's all safe.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Lantus for one thing does not peak appreciably, it is a good background or basal insulin for most of us. The other one is Levemir.    If the doctor thinks this may help, try it. Lantus is not going to kill the kid, and may make life easier.     However, it can burn quite a bit if injected when cold, and cold is anywhere less than body temperature! It also can burn quite a bit if you hit a muscle when injecting. And kid won't like either of those very much and may run screaming after the 2nd or 3rd such hit!

6nzGlDzpaa	This always confused me when I was a teenager....UNTIL someone told me that the day you start your cycle is Day  1....all the way around until you start your cycle with Day  1 again.  AND, since every month is not 28 days ("normal" cycle), your period will not come on the same day each month.  Check this out 365 (days a year) divided by 28 (average cycle) = 13.....BUT, we have 12 months.  Anyway, it is about YOU---not the calendar!!!   Everybody is different....your job is to figure out what is "normal" for you!!!|`|fAcVndo7aa	Maybe it's not late - if there's a pattern to it, maybe you just have a long cycle.  The "normal" range is anywhere from 28-35 days, and in some women, it can be up to 45 days.    You should still consult with your gynecologist to be sure nothing is wrong, but if it's regularly ten days later, I'd say it's probably not a big deal.|`|AFkmdu92aa	go to the doctor that's not right, they will know what's wrong. it  could be something serious so go! ha hope it helps:)
B9ZbNGSTaa	I would make sure she goes to a good cardiologist and that he/she explains to you what the cause of the mitral valve regurgitation is, how severe it is, whether the left ventricular size and function are affected, and what the treatment options are.  Unfortunately, there are no homeopathic therapies that are known to be effective.  However, mitral regurgitation is well-tolerated for a long time, and your grandmother may only need to be followed clinically if the regurgitation is not severe and if she is asymptomatic.  If the regurgitation is severe and if she's symptomatic or if the left ventricle has become enlarged or weakened, surgery is the best way to go as long as she is thought to be healthy enough otherwise to tolerate it.    With all due respect, I don't take that magnesium deficiency argument seriously.  A single paper from a group in Poland does not constitute "significant scientific evidence".  The fact that it was published in the journal "Magnesium Research" should suggest the value of the study.  I suspect that's the only journal that was willing to review and accept the manuscript.  Additionally, the paper addresses a very specific form of mitral valve disease called prolapse, which is not necessarily the problem with your grandmother.  On top of that, the criteria the authors used for MVP are not well defined (a major problem with that diagnosis) and the methodology is otherwise questionable.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Instead of searching for a wizard to cure your grandma see a good cardiologist and ask him what to do.|`|AA10481903	There is a significant amount of scientific evidence that mitral valve prolapse (leakage) is caused by magnesium deficiency.

6HO9NIuUaa	Almost nothing is affected by washing when it comes to nutrients unless that water is boiling.  Fats are not soluble in water so there's nothing to worry about there ever.  You can crush them and mix them in a drink, salad, or meal and get some omega-3's there.    Flaxseeds are one of THE best sources of ALA or alpha linolenic acid which is a type of Omega 3 fat and its the essential fatty acid you're mentioning.  Its been shown to be anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, immune-boosting, and helps regulate blood sugar for the overweight and pre-type II diabetic not to mention the fiber!    Important:  If you're buying the whole seeds, you need to break the outer shell before you eat them.  The seed in its whole form cannot be digested by humans and you won't get any benefits besides the fiber. Grind or crush them before you eat them.

a6ff9f59e8aab5e4708f774467c8272faa	If the person you are having sex with is the samethen you both share the viruseven though your partner is not showing any signs.      You and your partner will not ping pong the virus back and forthyou have the virusyou may have a reoccurrence due to auto-inoculation, reactivation of your virusor new tissue being exposed againand due to your bodyyou have not built the necessary antibodies to fight the virus....sex does create micro-abrasions which allows the virus to enter new tissue.    It is sometimes wise to use condoms after any treatmentreoccurrences usually occur with-in the first year or so.    Condoms do not prevent the transmission of the virusbut condoms may help in the regression of the virus for both the male and female.    Tell any new partner about your past infection.you can promise that you will not share your virusand a new sex partner may share new HPV types with you.    I wish you well.       ping-pong" effect  in which you and your partner keep re-infecting each other with the same type. (In other words, you don't need to worry about passing the same type of HPV back and forth.) However, if you become sexually involved with a different partner, you may pass any types of HPV that are "active" in your body to her, and vice versa.     Remember: HPV is not a sign that you or your partner has been unfaithful. HPV can be "silent" for many years before it is detected by a test. Your partner may have had the HPV virus for a long time, and there is no way to know when or from whom she got it.    http://www.thehpvtest.com/About-HPV/FAQs...|`|oaJcgz3uaa	They tell you not to have sex for a few weeks after the procedure because your cervix needs time to recover.  I would follow your doctor's instructions and wait on having sex.    Unfortunately, HPV is a virus that encodes its DNA into your own DNA, meaning it will be present in your body forever.  It is possible that you will never display symptoms again because your body builds up an immunity to the invading cells.  However, it's possible that you could display symptoms again.  Some women can be symptom free for years, and will have a reoccurance of displasia.  Your gynocologist should be having you do regular (at least six-month) pap-smears to watch for displasia.  Cervical cancer is 100% preventable as long as you take the steps to detect the abnormal cells before the develop.    If you have unprotected sex with a new partner, then it is possible that you could get a new strain of HPV - there are hundreds.  If you  have unprotected sex with the same partner (that gave you HPV), you will not have to worry about re-exposure to HPV because you already have that strain.  Be aware, though, that men cannot be tested for HPV unless they display genital warts, and almost all the high-risk (cervical cancer-linked) strains of HPV do not cause genital warts.    Gardisil is a vaccine that prevents against SOME kinds of HPV, including SOME high risk strains.  Getting the vaccine will protect you against some exposure, but like I said, there are hundreds of strains of HPV.    HPV is an extremely manageble STI, just remember to get regular pap smears!

Once you find one make an appointment and this time talk to them. everyone at some point in their life needs someone to help them, as much as we want to we can't always help ourselves. be kind to yourself! good Luck and God bless You!|`|7KJcMpl9aa	I'm not sure how you would go about doing it, but you definitely need to talk to someone about this.  See about a counselor at school, or somewhere like that.    You could call Kid's Help Phone, they might have some suggestions.    1-800-668-6868    Good luck!|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Wow it sounds like you have been through a lot. Think of it this way, it will make you a stronger person in life because you have survived it. Take your mind off yourself by doing things for others less fortunate, volunteer at a homeless shelter, or an animal shelter. When you do things for others you feel better about yourself. As far as your friends and all their drama, when they start moaning and bitching about their petty garbage, change the subject, remind them of how fortunate they are and talk about something else. You don't need that junk to listen to.

Actually happened on my 12th birthday between the dinner course and my birthday cake.  Yippee, happy birthday to me.

2sycPf8Daa	As the heart undergoes depolarization and repolarization, the electrical currents that are generated spread not only within the heart, but also throughout the body.  This electrical activity generated by the heart can be measured by an array of electrodes placed on the body surface. The recorded tracing is called an electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG).  A "typical" ECG tracing is shown to the right.  The different waves that comprise the ECG represent the sequence of depolarization and repolarization of the atria and ventricles. The ECG is recorded at a speed of 25 mm/sec, and the voltages are calibrated so that 1 mV = 10 mm in the vertical direction. Therefore, each small 1-mm square represents 0.04 sec (40 msec) in time and 0.1 mV in voltage. Because the recording speed is standardized, one can calculate the heart rate from the intervals between different waves.<br>  <br>  Depolarization of the heart from sinus impulse suppresses other potential pacemakers; their activity is normally recognized only when sinus rates fall below those of other pacemakers. The emergence of lower pacemakers to sustain a heart rate when the dominant pacemaker fails is called an escape mechanism. During an escape mechanism, the heart rate is therefore slower than the dominant pacemaker.<br>  <br>  Electrical depolarization of the atrial and ventricular myocardium is not synonymous with atrial and ventricular contraction. As a rule, electrical depolarization of these structures must precede the corresponding mechanical contraction; however, mechanical contraction occasionally may not follow the electrical events as, for example, during electrical-mechanical dissociation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|cfc6c0f015d8ca942aaceca074dfb71aaa	If you are familiar with the hearts electrical system, the SA Node (sinoatrial node) is the natural pacemaker of the heart. when the SA Node "fires" it sends an impulse down the electrical system of the heart. On the EKG tracing, this will be shown as the P wave. This is the depolarization of the atrium, the upper 2 chambers of the heart. As the the electrical impulse progresses, it moves to the AV node (atrioventricular node) then to the Bundle of His, again on the EKG, shows as the QRS wave. This is the depolarization of the ventricles or the bottom chambers of the heart. The impulse progresses through the Purkinji  fibers into the ventricles. After the QRS, there is a little bump called the T wave. This is the heart repolorizing itself and the process begins all over.
h4z5OARQaa	Mono is spread by bodily fluids, like saliva, mucus, and sometimes even tears. So if you've avoided contact with any of her fluids, you should be good...<br>  However, if you notice a sore throat developing, head and/or body aches, fever, and fatigue, I'd look into it.<br>  You can experience pretty much any typical symptom with Mono.<br>  If these symptoms seem pretty apparent, go to your doctor. They'll have to take blood, just a finger prick, but this is the only way to know for sure.<br>  <br>  Symptoms generally show for 4-6 weeks but may be present for longer, even up to months.<br>  <br>  Also, Mono is caused by a virus, so there is no treatment for it but bed rest and avoid a lot of physical activity. Your spleen will be sensitive during the illness and if impacted, could possibly rupture. :/|`|CphiOIpnaa	I think you should go to the doctors and be tested for it.

You may also have spotting randomly.  I was on Depo for a year and a half and some months I would have nothing, some months I would spot for 2 to 3 weeks.  Everyone reacts to it differently.

56d0d2eda3f545e68c5580a9672d3985aa	Since the breasts themselves are just adipose tissue (also known as fat) you can't do much to firm the breasts themselves. You could, however, make them appear more prominently by working on your pectoral muscles (yes, females can have pectoral muscles without seeming ugly or anything like that). The pectorals are the layer of muscles right below your breasts, so if the pecs are strong, your breasts will appear not as saggy and more 'perky' (if that's the right word). Pushups, benching, and benching with dumbbells will work your pectorals out.|`|28d8fd14e52278e31f54fa296921aecdaa	There are none, most of the breasts are fat, there are no exercises you can do to firm up fat.|`|8f6e765a5377299edf1eeffca4e912cfaa	Drive to the bank, apply for a $10,000 loan, drive to plastic surgeons office, viola - perfect breasts!|`|d4600e8b09dca77810d42187a1f08499aa	Try using your hands to flap it upwards 20 times a day on both sides.

AA10105638	I would very much advise you to do it.  I am 44 years old and had it done last year.  It cost me nearly $2600 for both eyes but was well worth the cost.  Although I must admit I have went through about 6 pair of sunglasses since then because I keep breaking them.<br>  <br>  The experience was interesting to say the least.  They flap your corneas and then use the laser to burn your prescription onto the flapped part of the cornea.  The sensation is a little unsettling and somewhat claustophobic.  They will give you a light sedative to help with you with those sensations.  I was given about 5 mg of Valium.<br>  <br>  After the surgery you will note a little blurriness and a stinging sensation in your eyes.  You will definitely want to wear the sunglasses they give you or bring your own because your eyes will be extremely sun sensitive.  I would ask for a heavier sedative for when I get home because you will need it later.<br>  <br>  I had an extremely hard time sleeping the night of my surgery due to the pain.  Think about a burn on your finger.  Not a blistering burn just an annoying first-degree burn.  It stings like crazy for the first 24 hours.  Now think about that sting in your eyes.  Once you can sleep for about 6-8 hours then you will awake with a very minor sting which will be there for about the next 24 hours. But it will be nothing like that first day.  After that it is "gravy".  My vision actually decreased a bit because my eyes were so over-corrected that I had 20/15 vision with my glasses.  I now have perfect 20/20 vision in both eyes.  No more glasses, contacts, or anything else. A good pair of sunglasses and I am good to go.<br>  <br>  You will kick yourself if you don't have it done.  I was worried in the beginning about it being too new but the surgeon that did my surgery has done over 50,000 LASIK procedures.  The whole process on the day of your surgery will take about 2-2.5 hours.<br>  <br>  I wish you good luck if you decide to have it done and I hope your surgery turns out just as well if not better than my own.|`|AA12047420	Cosmetic Surgery (including facelift/ breast enhancement tummy tuck./lipo/hair transplant/lasik) is very cheap in India.There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges cosmetic and lasik surgery for foreigners in India.They are called the Forerunners Healthcare.I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories.I have also read that they arrange financing for international patients as cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance in USA or by the stinking NHS in UK<br>  <br>  They also have photos pasted of their International patients.You can checkout their website.The cost savings are incredible.As a doctor i personally believe that your surgery can be easily handled in India as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world.The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star .<br>  <br>  My cousin got his lasik surgery and he is more than very happy with the results.He is all praise for this forerunners healthcare companyfor the services they provided her.He paid just 30% of the cost what she was quoted in USA and it was like a wonderful vacation for her.Excellent stay,food, best surgeons-he just couldnt stop talking.hope this helps.I think he paid only 1500$ for which he was quoted 4300$ in USA.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a>|`|e0b0c1926ee8878503a0ad041e280fd9aa	consider prk also. prk has fewer long term risks because there's no flap cutting (also, there's no eyeball cutting, which i would have had trouble with). it is painful for a few days, but worth it. it was expensive ($3600 for both eyes) but i weighed the expense of contacts every year, glasses every time i lose them, etc, and it suddenly didn't seem that expensive. i'm definitely glad i paid for a good surgeon rather than looking for a discount. btw, i used care credit, which is a good option if you want to extend payments with no interest.

The "popping" feeling you described happened to me and I also could not stop yawning, especially about 8 hours after my dose.<br>  I lost weight and used to get very nauseous. I discussed my symptoms with my doctor and decided to stick with prozac which is now working well for me. Zoloft gave me a very dry mouth and made me unbearably sleepy. Prozac does not do this.<br>  I am also allowed 14 diazapam pills a month which I take on an "as need basis" because of the risk of addiction.<br>  Your symptoms should improve, but remember to discuss with your doctor>|`|7cdd4afadeb786cbae784477a7352aeaaa	I did several years ago. I have an aggressive personality and therefore prozac and me did not mix at all. I had violent tendencies on it. The doc said I would have an I don't give a crap attitude. He was right. I thought nothing of lashing out physically to anyone who made me mad or I was just tired of.|`|AA10097732	I've been manic depressive most of my life and have gone through a dozen medications as the old ones stop working sooner or later.  You will probably have to try one or two more before you find an effective one that will help you.  Remember, they all have one side effect or another.  A lot depends on what you can tolerate.  You did not say how long you'd been on prozac.. 30 days is not long enough to see what all of the side effects will be.  Some of the side effects will go away after awhile.  Don't automitacally make the connection between ear popping and prozac.  It could be caused by something totally different.  Have a Dr. eliminate that issue by having your ears checked.|`|acda3f60f8ea15dd340d69d6751ac983aa	I have never taken Zoloft, but I have taken Prozac, Paxil, and Effexor. <br>  <br>  Whenever you switch to a new antidepresant, the first few days are really weird. There is always a weird sensation in your head and you don't feel like yourself. If you are feeling mania, tell your doctor immediately, because that'a a bad sign of how the medication works with you. <br>  <br>  I would wait about a month before you actually decide whether it is okay for you. My experiences with Prozac in the first couple days were very similar to yours. After about a week, I felt no real effect. It was like I was my old, depressed self. I guess my chemistry didn't work right with it. Paxil was horrible and I was definelty a zombie while on it, and Effexor worked the absolute best. <br>  <br>  I took antidepressants for about three years. I stopped taking them about 9 months ago. When I researched the effects of antidepressants in the long term and short term, I was definetly afraid for my health. Most of the effects you experience in those first couple days can stay with you for the rest of your life. This website below can lead you the right way.<br>  <br>  Im not trying to knock you off you perscription or anything, I just think you should know all the facts about the chemicals you are ingesting everyday. I was never told any of this by any doctor or medical official while I was taking them, only after. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI</a>

Open the drapes or turn on some lamps.  Natural sunlight is best.  If at all possible, go outside.  The colors around you are important too.  Try yellows and greens.  Gray, black, and blues are not the best if you are already feeling blue.  Green is the color of growth.  I always feel better after I take my dog for a walk outside.

I have lost alot of weight and have toned up significantly due to the tips andtricks on ivillage.com. Also drink plenty of water. Stay away from sugars and limit your bread intake. No sodas, no candy, no fast food. try to eat salads, tosted bagels, and yogurt for snack instead of mickeys or a quick fast food snack. <br>  <br>  I guarantee that if you eat any fast food at all, and stop. You will see dramatic results soon. I completely stopped eating fast foods. Try not to eat too must cheese, While you are excercising, drink gatorade or powerade. <br>  watchingyour diet is so important. I have kids and don't get a chance to excersise a lot, but I have still been losing weight because of the diet I chose to maintain.<br>  <br>  At first it may be hard to qut or limit some of those foods, but, remember that a lot of times, it is howmuch of what you eat you eat. It is ok to treat yourself once a week or so. But don't over due it and limit on the non healthy foods as much as possible. <br>  <br>  Also, now I don't eat anything fried. Try to grill and bake as much as possible. Baking doesnot mean add a ton of oil for flavor. I bake my fish withno oil, and it turns out so delicious. You would be surprised as far as to how many different foods you can cook naturally in their own juices. <br>  <br>  Another thing, when you buy juice make sure it is 100% juice and not juice drink. Try to get the unsweetened juices also. the less sugar the better.<br>  <br>  But, try that web site out <a href="http://diet.ivillage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://diet.ivillage.com/</a> and look under diet and fitness. you will find loads of info there.They also give you different excersises for any and every part of your body you can think of.

I am in the exact same position as you right now and I am not even wearing glasses or contacts...I'm too poor to buy new contacts :p  the reason why you can't wear contacts pasted the expiration time is because they loose their ability to send oxygen through the lense.

Either way, you should be ok wearing them. make sure that you are soaking you contacts in solution at night, and always make sure that they are moist when putting them in. Often times too, you might have a dirty finger and dirt clings onto the contact before you put it in your eye, thus causing you eye to water. On the other hand your eyes probably burn because you dont wear them a lot, or just normal adjustment. remember, that you contacts are a medication perscription, and should be treated like medication in a bottle; the sooner they are to expiring, the sooner you need to renew it. take care!|`|AA11770072	in my openion, there is no harm in using expired lenses for a month or two, under special circumstances. order a new pair and get rid of them as soon as possible
0CNaq92taa	Thats the downside of all drugs including alcohol and tobacco.When a drug goes into your system the first time it hits 100%.The second time ,your immune system recognises it and slowly builds up a resistance,as most drugs are toxic.The reason that skunkweed is so strong is because the various strains of marijuana were cross bred and genetically modified for max strength in Holland and is a hybrid plant.Hydroponic farming is a method of force feeding with loads of artificial light,heat,fertilizers and nutrients,without soil.High risk business coupled with high electricity bills.

If you have MRI's or X-Rays they can tell how bad it is or if you need surgery.|`|8NbpkRpEaa	Hell no. I'll tell you how to get it fixed fast.

After they remove SOB disc you will still have a little pain, but not as bad you do now. Took me ten years of misery to find that out. My nerves are still  shot, but I am now pain free. Hope that helps.
bAxjU717aa	I think a condom and one or the other on the foam or film.  I wouldn't overdo it.  But always ALWAYS use the condom!!!  It prevents more than just pregnancy, and don't think it can't happen to you.  I got HPV (which can cause cervical cancer) because it didn't occur to me to worry about more than HIV/AIDS or pregnancy.|`|tQZpjamqaa	Well, as long as you don't use 2 forms of latex, you should be ok. Like a Female Condom and a Male Condom, the friction of the 2 condoms together will cause breakage of one or both of the condoms. Don't put a Male Condom over a male Condom ('DOUBLE STRENGTH') ever!!! Same thing - friction. The Foam, a Condom and getting on BCPills would be the best way to go though...     I'd get the Clearblue Pregnancy Tests (pack of 5), and use them ONLY when you feel it's necessary.    Hope I helped...

WupyR6UEaa	Unfortunately many women go thru this every month.  I used to get cramps so bad I would faint.  Your Gyn should really make sure there is nothing wrong.  After years of suffering, the found out I had cysts on my ovaries and they would pop, causing the pain.  They also found adhesion's, and my uterus and bladder were stuck.    I would recommend heating pad or hot water bottle.  I read that someone told you to take Aleve  (naproxen) which is fine, but also mentioned 800mg's of Motrin (ibuprofen).  I would take one or the other 3 days before my period started.  Do not take them both.  They are in the same class of medications (nsaids) non-steriodal anti-inflamatories.  Be sure to have food in your stomach before taking either.  These actually help with inflammation, where tylenol and narcotic pain medications just help the pain sometimes.  I ended up going on the pill after trying herbals, pain meds etc.  The pill helped the most.  My Mom wasn't too thrilled about putting a 13 year old on the pill, but was glad after she saw the results.    Good Luck!  I got migraines also every month.    Rx Tech|`|6SB4ufEYaa	The pill can help a lot.     It's not your mothers decision. It's yours. If you want to go on the pill - do it. The doctor is not allowed to tell your mother.    Heated things help. A hot water bottle. A wheat bag. And light exercise.|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	I get them really bad too. I swear by camomile hot tea  with lemon.     Don't have caffeine wich means no coffee, no chocolate, no sodas. Be careful with sodium as well.     Eat a banana for the potassium as it helps with cramps.     Use a heating pad or hot water bottle.    Take Vitamen D and a water pill before your period or right after starting.     Eat broccoli and avacodo's; don't ask. Something in them helps i'm not sure why.     Drink lots of water.|`|31oOryfoaa	i know this may sounds weird, but try eating chocolate. It helps me so much. Also try using a heating pad on the area you are cramping when you can :]|`|eQWAVpDXaa	Drink two glasses of hot water..be calm and relax as there will be moodswings and try to avoid taking fried foods or oily foods ...take more vegetables and fruits during that phase...|`|3OeE8kMQaa	I used to get awful, I mean really awful, cramps with nausea with my period as a teen. I found, even though this sounds weird, that if I took less pain killers (ie: Advil ect) it wouldn't be as bad the next month.  Try to exercise more it does help. Also try alternative methods, acupuncture really worked for me. The pill might really help as well, you will get a lighter flow that doesn't last as long, but I agree with you mom there are other less invasive ways to handle this... unless you're sexually active/or planning to be, in which case please please get on the pill!!!!|`|yhGJ2Shjaa	Go get curbstomped, you *****!|`|ZOIcvlroaa	I used to get really bad cramps.  I mean bad! Putting pressure on my abdomen used to help.  Like laying on your back with something heavy on it or balled up with a pillow in your lap.  When I needed to function lol I took Aleve, my doctor recommended it to me and it really really worked.  If that doesn't work I would say go to the doctors and get some 800miligram motrins they kill just about any pain.  I was on them after giving birth to both my children so if that doesn't work you might have a more serious problem on your hands that needs to be addressed.  As for the pill I was never on it, the patch was always my thing.  It helped with regularity, but cramping was still just as bad.|`|5VbLEuiqaa	eat bananas they help|`|8ebace53ced50f1918907901847f7907aa	Hi there,  First I would like to say that I am sorry that you are going through this. It can be very frustrating and exhausting. I know exactly what you go through, I have always had extremely painful periods, to the point of passing out and throwing up. I also am a very heavy bleeder and I can hardly get out of bed, even after taking prescription pain killers. I am sorry that the gyn you saw said it was normal, unfortunately this is all too common. I thought it was normal for a long time too, sweety it isn't. My regular doctor told me it was normal too, leaving me very confused and angry. Trust me please, this is not normal. I am not trying to scare you, but I was just recently diagnosed with a condition called Endometriosis and it sounds like you could possibly have it.  Here are some of the symptoms, which you don't have to have all of them to have Endo.  * Pain, which can be:  o Pelvic pain.  o Severe menstrual cramps.  o Low backache 1 or 2 days before the start of the menstrual period (or earlier), becoming less during the period.  o Pain during sexual intercourse.  o Rectal pain.  o Pain during bowel movements.  * Infertility, which may be the only sign that you have endometriosis. Between 20% and 40% of women who are infertile have endometriosis.1  * Abnormal bleeding. This can include:  o Blood in the urine or stool.  o Some vaginal bleeding before the start of the menstrual period (premenstrual spotting).  o Vaginal bleeding after intercourse.    I would definitely find a new gyn to see. I hope that this helps you and that you start to feel better soon. If you have any more questions or need anything, just shoot me an email.|`|kOoHPvmjaa	From your description about your cramps, you may have a syndrome called Poly cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  I have too suffered terrible cramps. I would be up two to three hours a night, once a month in pain. I couldn't even sleep, all I could do was lay there.  I tried all sorts of medication too but it didn't work for me either. I went to the doctor after several months of pain.  They took tests and told me that I have PCOS which is a common endocrine disorder for women. I have added a few sites that will tell you more about PCOS.
WupyR6UEaa	I would go to the Dr. to see if you have herpes and find out why you have swollen glands.  I would suggest not kissing anyone until you have been to see the Dr.  If it is herpes simplex 1, it is very contagious.  There is a prescription medication that can shorten the duration of it, but once you have it, you have it for life.  You might want to try www.webmd.com and go to symptoms.

6Z0lSnM5aa	Depending on where you are I know you can go to any pharmacy or grocery store to get you BP checked in the US. Also you could personally  buy a BP machine to check it at home. Don't increase the dosage of your meds unless ok'd by your Dr. You can excercise and change you diet to try and help. The main thing diet wise is decrease your salt intake. That can make a huge impact on your BP. So pay attention to your sodium intake. Good luck :)|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	no stress  eat right,veggies,fiber,fruit,oatmeal,cereal exercise,lose wt if needed,low salt dash instead|`|FUoKu13Daa	You can buy bp machine at drugs store for about 30-40 dollars and if your reading continue to be a little high or high tell your doctor, he might want to increase your dosage or maybe give you a different prescription.    also watch your sodium intake and maybe you might want to eat foods that lower your cholesterol like oatmeal and banana apples and maybe take flax seed oil. If you lower your cholesterol it usually lowers your blood pressure
ujs7u7J7aa	A stent is in there for life once it is installed.  The wall of the artery actually grows over the stent so it would be next to impossible to remove.    Arteries can eventually close over again even with a stent in place.  These days there are actually stents that have a coating over them which contains a drug which is slowly released into the blood stream which helps prevent the artery from reclosing.    Once having a stent fitted you will most likely be on some sort of drug thinner for a year or so to prevent clots around the stent and will probably be instructed to take aspirin daily for the rest of your life which also helps keep the blood thin.    I guess if the stent does start to close over again then you would be looking at bypass surgery.|`|fQebKAWlaa	The life of stent depends upon many factors.:    1. If one is diabetic the life may be shorter say, 6-7 years .However, it can be increased if the diabetes is under control.    2.If one is non-diabetic the life may be even 10-15 years plus.    There only precaution that you have to take is to not to run fast or to do jogging.      Good luck.!!|`|OP7lLIitaa	u need to call ur cardiologist for these questions they will be specific to ur stent and u|`|AA11626362	Dont do the stenting.  The surgery to remove the plaque is better
AA10481903	Hi Meredith.  I had blepharitis when I was near your age.  I didn't know it then, but I have Celiac Disease and I now believe that contributed to the blepharitis (which I no longer have).      Celiac disease is a serious disease that damages the lining of the small intestine where digestion and absorption of nutrients occur.  It is caused by an allergic reaction to the proteins in wheat, rye and barley called glutens/gliadins.  Celiac disease is common but rarely diagnosed (about 1 in every 100 persons have it!).    Below is a link to a scientific review paper on eye diseases that includes a section on Blepharitis and potential nutritional interventions.  I would suggest the possibility of an essential fatty acid deficiency as a likely factor in my and maybe your blepharitis. (Celiac disease often leads to essential fatty acid and other nutritional deficiencies.)    http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltex...    Best wishes and good luck.

abae6afaf05cd4433e382fc342911d20aa	I agree stop the Flovent and see if the problems he is having go away! If they do you know it is the Flovent. Does your son have a peanut allergy? Flovent has peanut oil in it! My son has a severe peanut allergy and we found out the hard way!    If you think something is wrong with your son don't give up and if you need to go to another doctor. When my son was 6 weeks old I took him to the ER because he has a fever, was pale, and acting oddly. The doctor there treated me horrible and told me to leave! I drove 45 minutes to another hospital because I knew something was wrong and it turned out he had bacterial meningitis. When they took his temperature it was 106! I was so upset and I made sure that doctor and the hospital knew it!     In med school doctors are thought "If you hear hoof beats, look for horses, not zebras". "make sure they know that "a mothers instinct is better than a doctors knowledge"|`|oaJcgz3uaa	I have a few ideas that might answer a few of your sons symptoms, but I'm not a doctor, so these are only a few possibilities of what could be wrong with your son.    Stiff muscles and joints, as well as difficulty moving hands or limbs could be a symptom of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto-mmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your joints, causing pain and inflammation.  Some symptoms include include swollen fingers, sore joints and muscles, intense fatigue, or difficulty moving.  I was diagnosed with JRA when I was 15, and experienced the above symptoms.  I couldn't get out of bed by myself, I would wake up from intense pain when I attempted to shift in the night, one of my elbow joints filled with so much fluid that I could not fully straighten it.  I was referred to a rheumatologist when it became clear that my joint pain was "abnormal".  Patients who suffer from JRA have a low ANA count in their blood.  I doubt the ER would be looking for that, so I would recommend you contact a rheumatologist. The symptoms of JRA are treatable, and sometimes it goes away with age, sometimes it comes back.      It's also possible your son has lupus.  This is another auto-mmune disorder with similar symptoms.  After awhile, my doctor discovered that I had drug-induced lupus from an acne medication (minocycline/dicycline/polycycline).  I was taken of the medication and my symptoms eventually disappeared.  People who are pre-disposed to auto-immune disorders are likely to get induced disorders when on this medication.  Lupus is not always drug-induced, but in the off-chance your son is on this medication, I would see a rheumatologist immediately.    Either way, his symptoms suggest he needs to see a joint specialist (rheumatologist).      I hope this helps in some way, good luck to you both.|`|6W4ZWOetaa	It sounds like he's having a big time reaction to it; may be allergic to it... I would go to a different doctor and get a second opinion!!    I really hope your son gets better, poor guy!

Also, asthma causes the immune symptom to become weak. The Flo-vent may have possibly triggered rheumatoid arthritis. Although not common in children, it is quite possible. it sounds like he has the symptoms. 12 year old boys do not commonly fake serious health issues unless their are emotional or mental issues already existing. please consult a specialist. you are his mother. if your gut is telling you not to trust what the dr. is saying, don't. seek help elsewhere. do your research. be as smart as the doctors think they are!|`|EkdRA0qbaa	stop giving him flo-vent!!!   sounds like a major allergic reaction!    take him to another hospital, do not tell them what the other doctors told you, be firm with your suspicions and do not let them shake you off. you know your son better than anyone and if you think its real - push for that.
oPJxVcqJaa	When your muscles are cold, they're not as flexible as when they're warmed up. As such, when you exert any force, you run a higher risk of injury (e.g. muscle strains or sprains).    Of course, you run a higher risk if you don't stretch or cool down properly after exercise.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	If you go hit the heavy weights without warming up, you increase the chance of pulling or tearing your muscles.

J1AydXh9aa	your problem is not really the meds, but mainly because you're not eating enough calories throughout the day and your body is literally starving.  To stop your body from starving, eat an apple and cottage cheese right before bed.  The apple will help fill your liver glycogen level and help reduce the hunger pains.  In addition, the cottage cheese will provide a substantial amount of casein protein to your body during sleep.  Not only that, all of it is less than 150 calories and none of it will convert to fat... especially considering that you're eating dinner at 6pm.|`|prqrQcd1aa	find another med to help you sleep and that will not make you gain weight~!

d33c5360411aea77f0e1c670fb5e9265aa	It happens to every HEALTHY guy. Esp. they are between the ages of 14 and 29. It happens to me all the time. Sometimes I'm not even thinking/seeing anything sexual. There are thousands of situations that can cause an erection. Some men even have one when they are afraid. While others get one if they really need to use the bathroom. And it is also important to know that sometimes even when a man is seeing sexy images/people, that there are times that the muscle man doesn't stand up. It all has to do with ones thinking/state of mind and stress levels.     As for as it happening often? The answer would be yes.

The answer is Yes this does happen to almost every guy on a regular basis but it is not at so random times as you might think. It is almost always when he is otherwise not being physically active i.e. lying down, watching a movie, sleeping. Sleeping is by far the most frequent, most guys will have an erection at some point throughout a sleep cycle but a lot of times even a small nap will do it. This is why you will rarely see guys sleep on their backs without adequate comforter protection. It also does not have to be a full blown standing ovation but is more frequently a semi which is easier to hide but far more common.     This is also known as the NRB or no reason ***** because it does not have to have a erotic stimuli to cause it.     Some other things you might notice are guys pulling the waistband trick (flipping it up in the waistband), guys lying on their back with one leg bent up like a horizontal version of the wall lean, and guys flipping their book bag around to the front and pretending to check for something in it.|`|8cXAf7lCaa	I volunteer at a hospital and have to wear spandex underwear to make sure nothing crazy happens under those thin scrubs...

However, now that I am a lot older than that, it is much less common. I can look at beautiful women and not get aroused as easily and quickly. Even if a girl is really cute I can control it. Even in the worst case scenario, when I am standing really close to a beautiful woman and talking to her and she is flirting with me, etc, I can control my d**k!   However, if she is wearing provocative cloths and I start dancing with her and kissing her, it is all over, I will pop a bo*er right away! But then I don't care and I will even rub it on her to let her know she aroused me and I want to go further than just dancing with her!  Some times, when I am wearing swimming shorts or slightly tight pants and my shirt doesn't go down far enough to cover my package, I get a little nervous that I may get an erection. If I start to contract one, I will often have to think about something else, or pay the price of every one seeing it!  If a girl is arousing me and it is just her and me in a corner of a bar or somewhere alone, then, I will make sure she knows I have a hard on! Maybe stand up and draw her attention to my crotch, put her hand on it, or dance with her so I can rub it on her.  I do like to wear shirts that are long enough to cover my crotch any way, for that reason, to cover it up.

2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	Ohhh sweet little Bean ..... ima sorry you're in pain luv ....... i want to wrap you in cotton wool mate and make it all better ........ true story you know.    You nailed it in one mate ...... OTC's simply serve to bandaid the problem .... if you're lucky........ and never do solve the problem from the source............ Let Food Be Thy Medicine ..... Soccrates, cool guy you know.    Pain alleviation??  Are you referring to achy bones and headaches and migraines??    Insomnia, headaches and migraines, digestive troubles and constipation, bloating and cramping, achy bones and moodiness, terrible mood swings and irritability are all symptoms of calcium deficiency. For calcium to be effectively absorbed it is essential for the human body to have sufficient supplies of vitamin D (the sunshine vitamin) ..... calcium works best with magnesium, phosphorus, iron vitamins A, C, D...... and leafy and green vegies are rich in all except vitamin D.    Eat more foods rich in calcium such as  ~ leafy and green vegies... think broccolli, kale, chard, celery buk choy collard greens  .... you know the drill luv....... lightly steamed or raw cos cooking devitalises them .......  organic almonds and sunflower seeds and walnuts, brazil nuts, dried beans .    Take a fish liver oil supplement (a rich source of vitamin D) ........ cod liver oil is a good choice .... get advice from your local health food store as vitamins are NoT all the same ...... quality wise some vitamins are literally bed pan bullets .... Pharmaceutical Grade is the best quality and the easiest for your body to assimilate ..... being vegetarian you really do need to either focus on 10 - 15 mins daily of safe sun exposure or take a supplement ...... the richest sources of vitamin D are fish liver oils, sardines, herring, salmon, tuna, milk and dairy products ....... clearly, only the milk and dairy is suitable for you ...... and i'd rather chew off my left arm than recommend you pump up your intake of milk and dairy ...... given the levels of antibiotics the poor animals are fed and the extent to which the products have been processed and refined these days .......... that is of course unless it's the raw organic variety and that you aren't lactose intolerant.    Carbonated drinks ie ~ sodas and soft drinks ..... actually anything carbonated and antacids such as Mylanta, and also caffeine will rob you of your precious calcium supplies ... With carbonated drinks they leach the calcium from your bones because they disrupt the precious calcium phosphorus balance and your body simply rips the calcium straight from your bones in an effort to regain the balance ...... and caffeine inhibits calciums absorption......... caffeine hey ...... that wonderfull liquid gold will wash out all your B complex of vitamins which are so esential for healthy neural, immune and digestive functioning........ wash your vitamin C supplies which are so essential for collagen production and protein synthesis, immunity and iron absorption et al....... caffeine also increases the acidity in your gi tract and will make your body more acid ....... as opposed to healthy vibrant and alkaline..... oooooooh, sorry, i'm babbling again.    Avoid caffeine for a few hours before bedtime too...... but you know all that.    Aim for 2 - 3 cups daily ....... i have 2 in the morning and that's it for the rest of the day .......... unless of course it's been a really brain frizzlling day ..... then i might have one more.    Calcium is needed in our bodies to maintain strong bones and healthy teeth, to keep your heart beating regularly, help metabolize your body's iron and aiding your nervous system with impulse transmissions.    Do you also suffer from fatigue and exhaustion, dizzy spells, excessive feelings of being cold, nasty headaches, paleness of skin??? If so, these are all symptoms of iron deficiency anemia ...... without calcium your iron absorption will be inhibited........ pump up your leafy green vegies mate ..... the calcium, magnesium vitamin C, phosphorus, vitamin A, B vitamins and iron too  in green vegies are second to none...... give you more clarity and peace of mind....... more sanity and sleeeeeep...... i know it's a hassle cos i gots to do it too mate ........... 2 bowls full daily ..... if i miss a day of my vegies, cos i'm lactose intolerant (amongst others too boring to mention) i get my calcium from my green vegies and rice milk fortified with calcium and almond milk ........ if i miss a day of vegies i start losing sleep, getting headaches, sore bones blahblahblah.    Pump up you fresh filtered water intake too as the healthiest and happiest body will always be the most hydrated one.    Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) and Vitamin B3 (Niacin) work together to produce the brain chemical serotonin, which is essential for restful REM sleep, so take a multi B complex supplement that includes all the B's at least 4 hours before bedtime, ie ~ B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12...... if you take them any later you tend to get a restless bad dream sleep .... take them with food when you get up in the morning ..... do not buy any of the B complex of vitamins individually unless under instructions from a qualified practitioner or naturopath as the B complex all work best as a group.    ~ pump up your green vegies  ~ take a fish liver oil supplement  ~ take a good quality B complex ......

Some of the tips below might help you with the insomnia.     A warm bath is a great way to relax to help you to sleep. If you cant take a bath, you can give yourself a foot massage with slightly warm massage oil, sesame oil, or castor oil from a health food store.    What was very helpful to me, especially when my mind was racing, was to lie in bed and listen to relaxation CDs, especially those that contain someone speaking with relaxing music in the background. Many of these CDs are available on eBay for very low prices.    A helpful technique is to relax your body one part at a time. So you could relax your feet, your lower legs, upper legs, moving up from your lower belly up to your chest, etc., until your whole body is relaxed.    Of course, guided relaxation methods can help, imagining yourself in the country, the beach, or whatever is most soothing to you.    If you have annoying thoughts or personal issues that run thru your mind when you are trying to sleep, you might have to deal with those issues first. You might want to talk to a counselor or therapist about that. I suggest avoiding prescription sleeping pills unless nothing else helps.    There are herbs that are helpful for sleep, eg, valerian root, kava kava, chamomile, hops, passion flower, skullcap. Probably, valerian root and kava kava are the best. With some herbs, it can take a few weeks to build up in your system before it works.    You can also try 5-HTP, trytophan or GABA.

Not only will he not trust you, but now he is potentially going to have to deal with the herpes as well. (which contrary to popular opinion - herpes can cause other neurological issues - not just pain down below).    You need to apologize profusely (and repeatedly) and get as much information on the disease as possible. Sit down with him and your doctor and have an OPEN and honest discussion. He needs to be tested, as well as getting as much information as possible (so that he can make the informed decision)|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I agree with your new husband.

If the lady had genital herpes prior to becoming pregnant her immune system will have created antibodies that will be passed to the baby. I am sure you mean well but erroneous comments such as this lead to panic.     I have had genital herpes since I was 17, I was a virgin when I had the first outbreak and I have no idea where it came from. I have not had an attack for many many years now and would not bother to tell anyone about it. It is not a serious problem. 98% of people have the Herpes virus somewhere in their body, usually oral cold sores. If you had oral cold sores would you have bothered to tell him before oral sex???  Probably not, and he would likely not expect you to, but they are one and the same thing and can be passes from genital to mouth and from mouth to genitals also eyes and nipples.     There is too much of a stigma attached to this disease. I personally would be far more wary of a person who had caught syphilis or gonorrhoea.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	You should have told him before you got married, you weren't fair to him.

VvM521kWaa	Right: -10.00  -0.75x070  add 2.00  Left: -8.50  -0.75x090  add 2.00    In the great contacts vs. glasses debate, I'm on the glasses side.  I own contacts, but only wear them once every year or two.  My reasons for preferring glasses are (from least to most important):    1. As you can see, my prescription is complex, so my contacts are relatively expensive...or I could wear less complex contacts and glasses for my near vision, but that would rather defeat the purpose.    2. I've had unfortunate experiences with the contacts sliding off where they belong at the most inopportune times.  For example, the first time this happened was driving home, on the express way, after getting contacts for the first time - as you might imagine, for a person as nearsighted as I am that was quite scary.    3.  I've come to like having glasses.  Having to start wearing glasses (when I was nine) was both unexpected and traumatic...but I got used to them...then (after a long time) I got over it...and now, well, they suit me.  I'm not sure how much one influenced the other, but being very nearsighted and wearing glasses is now part of who I am and how I think of myself.|`|AW1OWmOtaa	Not 100% sure of my exact prescription but I wear my glasses from the second I wake up till the second I go to sleep.

Not sure why you're not experiencing pain. Maybe the nerve is already deadened?  As for pain during the procedure, normally, there should be only minimal discomfort because you'll receive anesthetic which should numb the nerve completely. Good luck!|`|49IMD2B7aa	they r not painful at all! i had 2 in each front tooth from a biking accident, the worst part is just the numbing shot, u feel nothin! :) but good luck!|`|49ab98a398999572255d3e22857a03faaa	Are you getting knocked out? I did back in Novemeber and they did some root canals on me through my 19 extractions. They also took alot of bone out too. Honestly? I woke up dazed but totally painfree! I thought I'd be in for it that night, but I hurt nowhere, it was amazing. The only discomfort I had was swelling and the stitches after they loosened up as the swelling diminished. It's honestly not bad, but you cannot drive yourself home, and you WILL be very sleepy. make sure you drink plenty hours later WITHOUT a straw. I wasn't drinking enough and I passed out flat the next day, thank god my husband was home with me. You'll be fine, don't worry. Anything is better than a dam ned toothache!|`|8JYMjw0caa	I've had two root canals. The first was for a really nasty and painful abscess, so the pain was related to that. But once he started cleaning it out, it felt a lot better.  He did give me Novocaine. I was surprised that it didn't hurt much after the procedure, and I was able to eat just fine after they put the temporary crown on. It was just a little sore after that. My second root canal was for a cracked tooth, but there was no pain (similar to how you describe). The root canal was fine, no real pain except some soreness afterward. I've had fillings that were worse. Honestly, I think the whole idea of the experience is a little worse than the actual experience. Thinking about what they're doing made me nervous, so I tried to refocus and not watch or think about it. If you can, bring an iPod or something and try not to watch. And remember that the whole purpose of the procedure is to clean out the root and make everything kosher in there so that you don't have worse issues. Keep positive, and you'll get through it just fine. Read some of the links below about root canals and pain to ease your fears.
edudNyaLaa	I've been through this for years with doctors, psychiatrists, and psychologists. Lexapro is still one of the most prescribed medications for depression/anxiety. All SSRI's are nearly identical (Zoloft, Lexapro, Celexa, etc.) There is not any new, more beneficial meds to hit the market since she began. However, and this VERY important, there are about 20 medications that are almost identical to Lexapro, just like the two I listed above. BUT, not every one is exactly the same and everyone will still react differently to each different med. Therefore, I am pretty sure that she may not be on the right one. I know tons of people that tried 3 or 4 different ones until they found the right match. Talk to her doctor about that.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	Antidepressants aren't a "cure-all" for depression and sadness, and there may be other issues and/or reasons as to why she isn't as happy as you'd like her to be.

I just read an article (from 2009) that says Lexapro is one of the better antidepressants to be on, I try to keep track of that - since I do take it.

uCRZzB1Aaa	I believe you should go to a doctor for a blood pregnancy test, as not every woman produces enough of the hormone that makes a home pregnancy test positive...

Good luck!|`|m4q3hikbaa	Maybe its stress. When your stressed alot you can miss your period for up to 5 months.
KppM3VzAaa	Looking at your photo there's not much wrong!  The your diet needs to be good to reduce body fat to get the toned result.    Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day and do exercise too.     You need to be having simple carbs (fruit smoothie, banana etc) before going to the gym to kick start the fat burning process, then a protein shake within 30 mins after finishing|`|o0Badlndaa	lots of sex with you on top ...giving lots of hip action and it works and also feeelllsssssss soo goood ...|`|8b96e3040c5552a5ae7c3bdd523c1c0faa	Join some good gym.

About 40 yrd sprints. the most effective way to build your abs is running. About 10 every other day    But what also can help is a bicycle ab. It works out all sections of your ab and believe me you'll feel it lol.  What you do is...    Lay down flat on your back  Put your arms wide out as if your going to make T with your body.    Now raise both legs and kick them out as if your riding a bicycle. Or runnin in mid air.    The key to this is to flex your abs while doing it and watch tv..(basically do it in front of  a tv and watch a program while doing it this will force you to flex your abs because your looking forward.)    Everytime your right legs kicks out that'll be one. Try to do 50 at a time. About 4 sets. Its painful but you can consider that just reaching your goal.

You could go for an "augmentation" but really do you want to be stuck with implants and the maintemance involved?...I know I wouldnt.  You get a better result from adding a few kilos/pounds, its cheaper and easier and not painful at all.

The doctor takes (what I think is called a scapula), a metal clamp thing that looks kind of like the mouth of a duck. They apply lube and then insert the device into your vagina, opening up the hole. Then, while it is pried open, the doctor takes a longer sized q-tip and gently scrapes your cervical opening, It will feel really weird but should not be painful. They're just taking cells from your cervical opening to test for cervical cancer.    HEADS UP: From experience, I learned that the doctor has to use the smallest size scapula on me, I'm a virgin. If the size they try to use happens to be uncomfortable, ask for a smaller size.|`|gC57M5TYaa	Don't worry about it is the 1st piece of advice i can give you, It all sounds much worse than it actually is!     You will be asked to lie on the bed with your legs apart, the Dr will insert a speculum in to your vagina just to open it up slightly so that they can get a good view of your cervix. Next they will use a spatula/swab and rub it gently over your cervix to collect a cell sample and thats it. you will be contacted about the result in around 6 weeks.    Its NOT painful at all but it can be a little uncomfortable for some women. I find them fine I was embarrased my 1st time more than anything! If your worried talk to the Dr/nurse who will be doing it they are usually very good and will explain everything you need to know.     Good luck Im sure you will be fine. x|`|Msgw6Z7xaa	Already answered this, but ill just tell you the same.  Your gyno will probably sit you down and talk you through the whole procedure.  Then you'll recieve a rob which you have to change into(take everything off underneath). After you do so, you lay down on the table and he do a topical exam .. then insert a spectrum.. (doesnt usually hurt but may be uncomfortable). During that your Doc'll take a few swabs of ur cervix so he can test for stds. n after that ur doc'll insert 2 fingers and feel your ovaries. And last your Doc will check for breast cancer.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Lie down and RELAX.  A speculum will be inserted and a sample taken.  Relaxing is really the most important thing!

It depends on the personality. You may just be a happy person with no issues to cry about. Perhaps you don't watch Oprah (keep it up).|`|mppB9ebgaa	Some people have different bodily responses to emotional trauma. Some people will cry with any prompt including laughter, fright, nervousness, sickness, and other emotions that don't usually result in tears at all. Then some don't cry. As long as your eyes aren't drying up, your tear ducts are fine. Its just a bodily reaction that some have, and some don't. Kind of like allergies.
TKHA5okpaa	I remember this tooo well. I had 3 wisdom teeth removed at the same time and by 5 days all of the teeth were feeling fine except for 1 of them. I was taking vicodin till I ran out then I had to take tylenol about every 2 or so hours just to survive the weekend till I got to the dentist. My stomach was so sick from the tylenol but was more bearable than the pain I was having.    I read about dry sockets too and had all the symptoms but from what I could see mine was closing up just fine just like you said. But when I got to the dentist they actually flushed it with water and mouthwash with this skinny little tube and I was sooo shocked ALL THESE FOOD PARTICLES WERE FLOODING OUT!!!  And I did have a dry socket because the little foods in there werent allowing it to heal from the inside even though the outside looked ok. The wisdom teeth are so far back and the holes I think are deeper than they seem, and i was drinking soup soup soup but the tiniest particles can get in there and cause you so much suffering while you have no idea.  If you can bear it then wait till the appointment, but like I said the pain in the other teeth I had pulled had subsided by 5 days so if it's causing you the same amount of pain it did the first couple of days then you should go see the dentist. Call them and tell them you had an extraction and are having this same pain they will WANT to see you right away.  I didnt think i had one either, but I bet you have a dry socket.|`|ENJ0bY48aa	I had my impacted wisdom teeth out and my horrible taste was due to food that was trapped in the hole that I was unable to remove for the first week while the blood clots were settling.    I would recommend calling the dentist or oral surgeon who performed the procedure.  You can describe the symptoms over the phone.  The doctor/dentist can then decide if you need to come in earlier or not and may be able to give you some suggestions.|`|1LPvMbXAaa	As you can see with the below link, dry socket is irritation of the bone, so you cannot see it on the surface of your healing wound.    Your symptoms sound like alveolar osteitis (dry socket), but you should give your dentist a ring to discuss it. If nothing else, he/she can prescribe the most suitable painkiller.|`|vaEkSkNnaa	definitely go to dentist cos you should not be in too much pain, if any.   Have had several extractions within the past year with no problems.   Ring dentist again.
v6Ka4gwbaa	Hello,     Yes it's true. Putting dairy products in teas, even creamers do actually neutralize all of the importance of the tea/s. I recently found that out and was quite bummed. Now, I am not sure if you were to put soy milk in it if it would do the same, as soy milk is not really dairy, but I do know for sure that real dairy milk does. Best of luck....
PN5wdj9Daa	Your writing makes me wonder if Alogia would be a fair diagnosis.  And, again, your writing makes me wonder if thought poverty is a fair estimate of your abilities.  You turned us on to the definitions/explanations in Wikipedia but do not say whether you agree with them as applied to you or not.  You "sound" desperate and the fact that you have been to 3 doctors makes me believe that you might be desperate.  Still I would suggest going to another doctor or doctors and asking specifically if Zoloft could have brought these problems about.  A Wikipedia article about Zoloft does not list alexithymia or alogia as side effects but possibly as reasons for taking the drug in the first place.  Do you know what your psychiatric diagnosis was at age 13 and why it was prescribed?  Do you know what your diagnosis is now?  All drugs have the possibility of having a paradoxical effect.  This means the drug causes the same problems for which it might have been taken!  This is more common in young people and in fact is a serious problem when prescribing psychotropic medications to children and teens.  You might want to do further research on this.  I would use other search resources than Wikipedia...like Yahoo, Goodsearch, Ask.com, Google, etc...and maybe after you have researched and then seen a couple more doctors you might want to consider seeing a lawyer (Your local bar association can help).  If you begin taking charge of your own treatment and care, you may begin to feel better overall.  I pray for you all the best.|`|4yrqRS4qaa	you've been on this med a long time.  and the side effects could be interfering over time.  i was on prozac for a while and it affected my short term memory after two years, this isn't what is common but went away after i quit the drug.  what do your drs say about trying a different med?
AA11464317	You obviously need to see a Dr. But in the mean time I have heard one way to stop coughing is to rub Vicks Vapo Rub on the soles of your bare feet then put on a pair of socks and go to bed. Seems the feet are good absorbers of things.|`|AA10980192	take sleeping pill and sleep, lol.|`|W9nDtf3maa	Definitely you need to go to a doctor...    Having a rough time coughing maybe caused by some respiratory ailment. I think it's a symptom of T.B. or tuberculosis. I've had once a cough, not a simple one, the type that won't make you go to sleep; I had pneumonia then. After that I consulted a doctor... and then he said that I had a "Spot," some kind of scar in my lungs (it was proven through X-ray).    I think it's best to go to a doctor before that cough goes to T.B.  I hate taking medicines!|`|mwtvYwzXaa	There are many reason for intractable cough. Surely you should visit a doctor. Amongst the common reasons, asthma is very important condition. Be sure that, you are not suffering from asthma. To know whether you are or not you can see the link below.|`|3syh4QyHaa	if you keep on coughing after you took a steam shower , then you might want to see a Doctor because you probably have asthma. then if you do you should get some medicine from your Doctor experience
XLXncQu9aa	I have never had a chemical in my eye to my knowledge with the exception of soap when I was taking a shower.  However here is the proper way to take care of that kind of situation.     1. Flush your eye with water. Use clean, lukewarm tap water for at least 20 minutes, and use whichever of these approaches is quickest:        * Get into the shower and aim a gentle stream of lukewarm water on the forehead over the affected eye. Or, aim the stream on the bridge of the nose if both eyes are affected.        * Or, put your head down and turn it to the side. Then hold your affected eye open under a gently running faucet.    2. Wash your hands with soap and water. Thoroughly rinse your hands to be sure no chemical or soap is left on them. Your first goal is to get the chemical off the surface of your eye, but then you need to make sure to remove the chemical from your hands.        *  Don't rub the eye  this may cause further damage.      * Don't put anything except water or contact lens saline rinse in the eye, and don't use eyedrops unless emergency personnel tell you to do so.|`|4BoteYDwaa	I used to work at a place that made hot tubs and showers. One day I was re-arranging the storage room and the forks on the forklift punctured a hole in one of the drums overhead (this chemical is stored in the dark). A small stream of organic peroxide spilled on me, it was the most painful thing I had ever felt. I still don't know where he got it from, but one of my co-workers found a box of Arm & Hammer baking soda and poured it on me. I was still in pain, but it felt considerably better the moment the baking soda hit my skin. For about two weeks it looked and felt like I had the most painful sunburn you can imagine, but it could have been much worse. I'm just extremely greatful for my co-worker, and his quick judgement.|`|H1tDH3sOaa	in science yes|`|VZFEB85Iaa	nope.|`|10AvUf8Jaa	My friend accidentally sprayed de-icer in my eyes (do not ask...long story), and there was another time that one of those glow stick-like necklaces busted and went into my eye. Both times it burned, but I kept flushing my eye out. Nothing happened though luckily. Just make sure not to rub it and if you wear contacts then now would be a good time to take them out. Good luck and i hope your eye feels better soon! =o)|`|7g69iD5Taa	Yes. Yesterday someone smacked a dirty rag with cleaning chemicals in it, right on the bottom of my eye. I slept and this morning it was kinda swollen and the bottom of my eye was all red and puffy. It really hurts when i laugh, blink or close my eye. So i just put eye drops in, twice a day. Its going away i guess. Its still red at the bottom tho.|`|86cbe4dd178cb02db522c4731c3db240aa	occasionally in the laboratory I touch my eyes without realizing the salts on my hands. Magnesium etc.. a friend of mine had iron filings (those minute ones) blown into her eyes once.. haven't experienced redness.    Though eye is sensitive, I suggest you to visit the doc|`|NlulTfFOaa	I've gotten all sorts of nasty things in my eyes, including hair dye (no, I didn't go blind).    They say to rinse your eye(s) out for 15 minutes when it happens, so I did. With water running over my eyes for that long everything was blurry for a while afterward :P
F9Ll7oLJaa	yes you can do 100 counts daily|`|ItOBf6Ojaa	I don't think skipping targets the belly specifically but skipping every day will help you lose weight overall because it makes you sweat. If you want to reduce your belly, you need to do exercises where you lift your legs and keep your torso still or lift your torso & keep your legs still (ie. varieties of sit-ups)    But if you do skip, make sure you do them in intervals of 2 mins. If you add other workouts, 10 mins in total is ok. But if you only rely on skipping, you need to do 15-20 mins. But you're taking a break in between so it's not that tiring!! Remember 1 jump per 1 rotation.|`|TrkI5gWbaa	Yes it will if you keep on doing it... for about ten minutes everyday i reckon also you should cut out junk food and chocolate  Skipping gets boring real fast too so maybe you might consider running or joggin?|`|UpbU10h4aa	Sure it might be of some help to decrease you tommy...but there are many other exercises were u could reduce like sit ups and walk a day at least half an hour which will surely reduce...take care buddy|`|L9hvSJ53aa	Skipping will not do much for losing your belly. I found an awesome belly fat loss e-book online a few months ago and it helped me lose my stubborn belly fat no problem. Perhaps it will work for you as well..here is the link http://my6packsecret.t83.net    good luck|`|X9QOHRLFaa	hi, well lets put it this way skip for an hour burns no more than 280 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.    www.xattack.in|`|Xad2J8bgaa	No such tea's or drinks would ever burn fat unless you do something physical. There is no easy way to become thin unless you had some liposuction. Someone must be trying to advertise his products here.    Skipping is a great way to burn fat! I tried to do skipping and looked for possible muscle contractions. It uses up your Gastrocnemius, sartorius, Quadriceps femoris, deltoids, pectoralis major, Biceps and triceps brachii the 3 vastus muscles and other major and deep muscles i missed. This would mean that your body is going to consume more energy and metabolize greater, Burning up more fats as your muscle tissue's source of energy to function. Remember that there are no exercises that would burn a specific location of body fats such as your belly, exercises simply burn fats from different parts of the body.    Sweating up does not really mean you burn fat. Sweating is a physiologic function of the body. Basically you sweat because your body is producing too much heat (hot weather or from exercise) and it's making your body too hot for you to have hyperthermia or high temperature, to prevent this your body releases sweat to cool up your body so your sweat does not really mean burned fat. a little portion of sweat could have fat content in it though.    Skip everyday but dont overdo it! With the right and balance diet, you'll realize that slowly your body is getting more and more fabulous.|`|pL5ggLAXaa	one year.
AA11375099	I cannot answer your questions or concerns, that is something that you need to do with your doctor, nobody knows your circumstances as much as he or she does.    You need to have all of your questions answered and I have had experiences with doctors that will be very fast in telling you what you have and then not understanding half of what they are saying.  In instances like this I have asked them to tell me in words I understand.  Usually, they will realize that they have been talking way above my level of understanding and slow down and explain things.    My wife's surgeon is so quick, but that is his nature.  He goes FAST!  and I felt that I was a student hearing a lecture in class for a Master's degree in Surgery.  So, I asked clarification questions.  Like, "What does that mean?"  Or, "Can you explain that?"  I would make sure my questions were answered.      It sounds like you need to do this too. You may get some answers here because there are doctors and nurses that help out in the cancer category.  They will answer it, but even with those answers you should still feel that you could ask your doctor the questions and have them address any and all of your concerns.    I know we all feel that doctors are very busy, and they are.  You can also telephone their nurse and have them ask the doctor for you.  My wife's oncologist has a great nurse and we have had her get some answers for us when our doctor was busy.    You cannot have these kind of questions about your case hanging over your head.  Communication between patient and doctor is very important, I hope you have better relationship with them in the future, for your peace of mind.|`|nOmX8XGUaa	it is true, you loose your hair and eyebrows. hate to brake it to you but you go bald so you need a wig. sorry.|`|bxlYleZkaa	It may mean you have only seven years to live, it may mean that after seven years you will require treatment again.I think your Doc should have been more positive and cleared with his dates when you saw him!

Treat yourself well and do something you find comforting, like a hot bath or a cup of tea.|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	Yes it happens to me too. Last year on holiday I had a panic attack in a shop in the middle of newquay, not good. But I went outside and sat down. My way of dealing with it, and this is going to sound strange but is to just be left alone. If my husband tried to comfort me that just makes me worse. If I'm left alone I can concentrate on my breathing, I just focus on my breathing, bringing it back to being normal, i dont rush it I just let it happen. I know once I'm coming out of it because thats when I cry and the shaking starts. Usually once I'm crying and all emotional hubby knows thats time to go somewhere, sit quietly for a while and just let me cry it out. I'm usually quite wobbly on my feet for a bit too so we normally go get a coffee or something, but again it comes back to just focing myself to regain control of my body  But the feeling emotional and crying can go on for ages, hours sometimes and when that eventually stops I'm just exhausted.    I think the crying and emotional stuff is our bodys reboot button. Our body goes through some intense feelings when we have a panic attack and by crying its a release and then we can re boot and start again.  Thats how I see it anyway|`|gapWTVmDaa	It is normal to be afraid or worried after or during any kind of disease. But it won't help. You just have to believe it will get better and it will.

6Z0lSnM5aa	You can actually feel your ovaries if you push deep enough.....I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be able to feel a baby. Your uterus increases in size and there is amniotic fluid around the fetus. Possibly you may have some sort of mass or tumor but I doubt it. Do you feel it on your left too? It is probably just your ovary or some other organ you are feeling. You can feel several organs from pushing on your body.|`|lHmfSDIYaa	Your uterus is about the size of a pear when it is not inhabited by a growing baby.  Just in front of that is your bladder and off to either side (and slightly north) are your ovaries.      Now, if you are feeling a ballish type thing to one side and not the other, you might want to have your doctor feel around there.  Just to be sure what you are feeling really belongs there and its not a cyst or something.|`|m4q3hikbaa	Umm idk look it up on the internet.|`|iUFIlbNgaa	i have no idea, sorry... maybe if you go onto  www.webmd.com  you could search your question, and find an answer.  If not, talk to your doctor.  It most likely isn't a baby, babys don't grow in the side.|`|VtCAiX6iaa	No.
PxEsutQNaa	There would be no difference. Resistance training barely burns calories as it is (only between 3-7 a minute, tops), so don't worry about working up a sweat while you're lifting. However, you do want to stay within your target heart rate during cardiovascular exercise in order to maximize the duration and benefits.|`|553ac7b7fe128bda796c55a6cfb5544daa	It sounds like your question is...at what heart rate should I exercise to gain the most benefit (being in the fat burning zone) during my cardio workouts?    There is an equation:  220 - your age = Maximum Heart Rate    If you were 30, then 220-30=190.     Your IDEAL fat burning zone is between 55%-65% of your maximum heart rate.      In this case    .55x190=55%=105 beats per minute     17.4 beats per ten seconds  .60x190=60%=114 beats per minute     19.0 beats per ten seconds  .65x190=65%=124 beats per minute     20.6 beats per ten seconds    You should be able to take your pulse for ten seconds and have a good idea if you are working too hard, not hard enough or just right.  If you are working too hard, slow down a litte; not hard enough, speed up a little; just right, keep it up    The other part of your question: it isn't necessarily better to run and then do sit ups.  Generally, you burn fat and calories for a period of time after you finish working out.  The goal of doing sit ups is to strengthen your abdominal muscles and to do that you need to have good form (versus just doing this for speed).  Once you develop good form, you can add weight (hold a dumbell across your chest to add resistance).  Doing sit ups will not help you if you're doing them too fast.  And going outside of your target heart rate (the one we just calculated) is only good to build endurance (if you were a long distance runner this would be helpful).       Good luck.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	If your on the young age you should try getting your heart rate up more than that for the best results.    My heart rate goes up to 190-215 when im at my hardest. I cant do that as much though because my heart starts acting all weird. so i stay about 160-180 and i get results.    as long as your out of breath and feel like your going to die, you know your working hard lol

IPpOd2wmaa	wow...normal a1C's should be about 6 and that is what I am guessing the 2.4 is which means instead of a normal bs of 80 you are about 40 or 50 all the time and THAT could harm the baby.  You should keep your bs at a higher level.  If you're not hungry just try having a glass of juice now and then to keep yourself level.  And test your bs (blood sugar) regularly.  You are not diabetic...but hypoglycemic.|`|6Z0lSnM5aa	Wow...2.4? Are you sure you got the right number from your doctor? Normal blood glucose levels are like 80-110 or somewhere around there. And usually pregnant women are at risk for high blood sugar- pregnancy induced diabetes. I would check to make sure you got the right info. But if for some reason you do have low blood sugar small snacks or juice could help bring it up a little if you are feeling dizzy or faint.|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	eat balanced meals at regular times.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	low blood sugar is the exact opposite of diabetes.  If you do not understand the info that your doctor gave you, then you should speak to him/her about it.|`|Yaxdy8U2aa	2.4  was probably your a1c ....which is pretty low.....a lot of women get diabetes when they are pregnant....but it goes away after the baby is born.....and no it wont hurt your baby as long as you check your blood sugars and take care of it.... :)
5mCm2XTLaa	Problem is there's not really any muscle in ones hands. It's all about your skeletal structure. Skin, bones, nerves, blood vessels ligaments and tendons are about all your hands are made from. Your fingers are controlled by muscles in your forearms.     All you can really do is strengthen you grip and wrists which will serve to build up the muscles in your arms. Your hands will get stronger but not any larger.

TvThS81Naa	Many sauna manufacturers promote the calorie burning effects of saunas. Although this often figures largly into their marketing and advertisements, the verdict is out on how many calories are actually burned in a single sauna session. Some reports show that a single 30 minute sauna session can burn between 300 and 500 calories.    The logic behind saunas and burning calories is that the increased heat causes the body to increase blood flow making the heart work harder. The heat also causes the body to cool itself through sweating, which also burns energy or consumes calories. Although, it is true that these effects will use energy and cause the body to burn calories, most of the weight loss that people notice when partaking in a sauna bath is from water loss. Water weight loss is quickly regained once you rehydrate.    Although the heat of a sauna will increase the amount of energy and calories burned, most of the weight loss provided by saunas is water, and not caused by burning calories.     Here read some of the articles about this topic:  http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Does_the_use_o...  http://tuberose.com/Sweating.html  http://www.diethealthclub.com/calories-b...|`|PxEsutQNaa	Yes, you will burn calories in the sauna because your body is certainly exerting energy. You burn calories throughout the entire day (sleeping, sitting in boring meetings, etc.), and the sauna is causing the body to work harder, thus using more energy. Oh, yeah, and you lose water weight too!    Edit: I should note, however, that the calories you burn in the sauna do nothing for your cardiovascular health, strength, or endurance.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	You dont burn calories in a Sauna. All you do is sweat. In order to burn calories you have to have a high heart rate for extended time. No calories burnt in the sauna though
AA10868929	Anna,  I do not know your age, how tall are you etc. Even your present weight.    Anyway, depending on your digestive system tolerance , you  may try to drink two glasses of  full cream milk mixing with quarter boiled egg, and one tea spoonful pure honey. Two times a day. Morning one glass and  one glass before sleep at night. ( if can not, take one glass a day).  additionally, eat boiled rice and mutton curry.    email me if you can continue this ?  rgds/ your friend from far.|`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	drink beer, eat food rich in fats , or use hormone tablets :-D|`|Y7OFoDxwaa	you can ACTUALLY work out...  gain some muscle... guys actually love girls with abit fitted body...  i myself do... if you meant gaining weight, eating alot is definetely NOT the solution... though you might wanna try some food that might aid you in you're fitness...  just dont get TOO MUCH muscles, and end up looking like one of those muscle freaks, though thats impossible to accomplish anywayz, lol|`|E2CdbyB9aa	One word...

If you want fat, simply eat foods that are higher in fats than what you're used to taking in (making sure to avoid trans and saturated when possible).    If you want muscle, you're going to have to lift weights (at least) and increase your daily caloric intake. If you want to avoid putting extra fat on, then you'll also have to do cardio exercises in addition.|`|StSNxUNWaa	Eat lots of Mcdonald's and Taco Bell stuff.|`|7swefA6Paa	lots of dairy products! or eat those huge protein bars that are like 500 cal a bar
b7037586581b82e483bcc45bea7734c9aa	You bet. Attention Deficit Disorder is the most misunderstood of all the psychological disorders and the one most often missed by clients and their doctors. Most people who are diagnosed as adults have been erroneously diagnosed as depressed, anxious, or bipolar before.    There are two main books on the subject. Healing ADD the Six Types by Dr. Amen and Driven to Distraction by Hallowell. I would follow their protocols. You can also find good information on www.add-care.com.|`|AA11526728	i feel same way. i need to know how something works, if not i get bored easily. when someone is telling a story, i often find myself cutting them off midsentence to get a quicker summary out of them. it makes conversations worse tho imo.
aLyJe1b3aa	definitely|`|07YBD5mJaa	I think you should let her know. even if you never want your sister to know, it's important that your parents know to help prevent this from happening ever again...if they are aware of it, they know not to leave you alone with him or anything like that. but if you feel that this may be a more serious problem for your sister, IE maybe he has done this to other woman, or their own children, maybe you should let her know. I am so sorry you had to deal with such a horrible thing. i wish you the best of luck.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Yes, soon, (maybe not just now, though) and about the cutting as well; it may be helpful in your treatment to not only have some idea about the cause, but to do what you reasonably can about it. Some families would try to "hush it up", to protect him, sometimes even blaming the victim, or refusing to believe her. To pre-empt such a course of action, I suggest going directly to the relevant authorities. Teen resources are shown in section 13, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris on pages A, K, & T, or http://www.coolnurse.com/hotline.htm (free US calls). They can advise you better than I am able to, being in Australia.     Although he may not be prosecuted, this time, an entry will be made on the sexual offender's database, so anyone complaining in future will be believed. He may well currently think that he can continue to get away with such behaviour, which often becomes worse, over time. You can stop some other girl from suffering. Also see section 20, on sexual abuse: minors, at ezy build. Pandy's is a good place to start.     A previous answer follows: View the suggestions on what to do about self harming, in section 16, at ezy-build, and contact them, when you feel the need to self harm/cut. Use one of the alternatives shown, such as snapping a rubber band against your wrist, or holding an ice cube. There is much information, and useful weblinks in the website: far too much to fit in the allowable space here. Seek therapy, to help you address the actual cause of those problems, rather than using an inappropriate method of treating the symptoms, which others have found, doesn't work, in the longer term, and that leaves behind the extra problem of scarring to deal with, then. There is also a selection of treatments for scarring shown. So, are you aware of why you self harm?     The general reasons given are: depression (see section 2, at ezy build; page R first, then, if female; page V, young women's depression, & teen? depression; eventually the rest); if male; male depression; anger (see section 4; page C first), attention seeking, or boredom (suggestions for both are in section 16). Stress is addressed in section 42, at ezy build; view the COMPREHENSIVE POST on page i, first, then the rest of that section. Consider taking up amateur abstract, impressionist, or surrealist art, clay modelling, designing and/or making fashion, or jewellery. Journalling those thoughts, and feelings, poetry, or story writing are some more options. No-one has to see them, but you may well surprise yourself at how good you become, with experience. Even if not, and you are totally dissatisfied with every single effort, it will still have served its purpose. Use that emotional energy, and allow it expression, through an activity other than self harm.|`|AA10558731	Yes, you were sexually molested and yes, you should tell your mother. There's no telling how many other girls he has assaulted ~ or will assault if he's not stopped.|`|6RiLrsuBaa	Yes, you should tell your mom, see a therapist, and maybe a molestation support group.    Your brother in law needs to be identified as a molester so that he can be prevented from molesting anyone else.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	Even though there were no actual sex acts, it is still molestation - so no, you are not exaggerating.  I completely and 100% believe you should tell your mom for a number of reasons.    1.  He molested you from the time you were 7 (so he was around 19, I assume) until you were 13.  It may be nothing, but he may like young girls which makes him a pedophile.  If your sister and he has children, his children may be in danger if you don't say anything.    2.  You may cause a "crisis" within your family and may ruin your sister's relationship, but think about your sister's perspective.  Would she really still want to be with someone who molested you, her younger sister?  I'm the oldest child in my family and in a relationship.  And let me tell you, if my younger sister told me my boyfriend molested her (because why would she lie about something like that?), I would no doubt automatically leave him.    3.  If you have been cutting yourself and believe it messed you up, you should seek for professional help (therapy, doctors, etc.)  For you to do that, you really need to let your mom know everything.    Despite all the negative things that may happen, you were obviously affected by what he did and you need to tell your mom.  Good luck!|`|fTjG1KGLaa	um yes!! tell everyone now|`|d0e1b5b2af884d02c8c1a86fcdf900caaa	Wow hun, okay.. first of all, whether there was sex or not, it's still considered sexual molestation. Considering he is 12 years older than you, it's intended sexual molestation and did not occur accidentally between 2 kids. I do think you should tell your mother. No, you are certainly not exaggerating. This is a huge deal and can have a serious impact on you for the rest of your life if you choose not to deal with it. A brother in law is someone you're supposed to be able to trust. He took advantage of that. He's obviously a pedophile and I would be concerned that he will continue to do this with other little girls. Not to mention, your sister truly deserves to know who she is married to.    Please consider getting this off your chest and talking with your mother. I was sexually molested from age 4 until I was 7, and even though he was caught, I'm still dealing with what it has done to me emotionally.    I wish I could come through the screen and hug you...  :(  I've been in your shoes.|`|3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	Wow honey. Tell somebody. That's so horribly wrong and I am so sorry. I know you are trying to do right by your family by not saying anything - but sweetheart - you need to. If I were your sister, I would want to know what kind of person I was married to! And by telling someone, you might be preventing another young girl from going through the same experience. And you are not "over exaggerating". Any physical contact or sexual remark - or ANYTHING that makes you uncomfortable - can be considered abuse. And that is wrong. And it's wrong for you to feel that you have to carry this burden of a memory on your own. Please talk to someone.|`|AA10980192	If I were ur bro, I didn't want u to do this.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	OK, first "Sexually molested" is not exaggerating.  It doesn't make a difference that he didn't have actual sex with you (that's rape).  Molesting is unwanted and inappropriate sexual contact and that's what has happened to you.    I know it's not easy to tell your mum, but you really should.  What he did was exceptionally wrong, and illegal.  You wouldn't like to think that he's doing it to someone else and he just might well be.  He is sick and needs help and to be kept away from children.  He is a pedophile and you need to speak out.    Talking about it isn't easy but you have to - for your own health.  This kind of thing is really confusing for the victim, but you have done nothing wrong.  Your sister is going to be upset (not with you but with him), but isn't she better off knowing what kind of a**hole she's married to before they have kids?  Or if they do have kids, what if he's doing this to his children?      You will not cause a family crisis - if this happens it's not your fault, it's his.  He is the one that has done the wrong thing.  Talking about it will help you deal with it.  Don't let it and him ruin your life.  Be strong, speak out, get help and make sure he doesn't get the chance to do this to anyone else.|`|4yrqRS4qaa	your not exaggerating.  here's the thing, you'd think most parents would support and help when they find out their kid was molested. the fact is there is a huge number of parents that don't.  a therapist, crisis center, or rainn.org can support you along with your mom.  hope your mom is one that is there for you.  take care of yourself|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	Absolutely he will probably continue with someone else tell someone now! at your school is a good place also !|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Sexual abuse always tears family's apart. No way around it.    If it doesn't implode or travel along already strained family relations, it breaks the abuser away from their family, since the issue of trust cannot be found for the victim among people who you think will either condone or accept the abuse.    The problem just isn't what your brother in law did to you (that stopped after he moved away.) The problem is how the brother in law made you feel: about yourself, your body, what limitations you can or cannot put on somebody else, and how to act in all those situations. Those ideas can remain many years, even decades, after the abuse last ended, and usually don't go away without some form of counseling (either professional or talking it through with friends.)    Cutting yourself does several things for you: it makes a physical scar, so that you can see, and confirm within yourself, that you are 'hurt', it gives you a sense of control (I decide if/when I want to do this and how much 'pain' I put myself through) that your b-i-l took away, and it gives you a sense of your own identity: this is who I am, this is what I do. Abuse, sexual physical or emotional, almost always creates some sort of identity crisis, because the abuser always asks themselves: why does so-and-so's feelings count more than mine?    There just is no nice way to say "Mom, sis' husband has been putting his hands down my pants since I was 7." The reason most victims don't tell others is because of a number of factors: disbelief from family and friends (so-and-so seemed like such a nice person,) shock, denial, ridicule, even fear and helplessness that the people being told also go through (it happened to someone close to me and I didn't/couldn't stop it.) That is why it always tears family's apart.    But, it is something that also needs to be done. What victims need is people on their side who are aware of what is going on. People like your brother-in-law can't be helped or stopped if nobody knows about it. The longer you don't talk about it, the longer it will be before you start to feel better. And it's going to take awhile before you do.|`|nNodrRbYaa	Yes you should.  sorry that happened to you:(   i cant believe how sick some people are!|`|gTnwq11zaa	YES|`|081d6c7533d0838a91761ef39d234714aa	This has been going on since the beginning of time, and it's the biggest challenge a young woman has to deal with. You can tell your mom and start a huge family ruckus, or keep it to yourself and carry the pain.  It'll really wreck up your family. I guess it depends on how you want to get past it and get beyond it.  If it consumes most of your daily thinking, it'll ruin your life.  That's why some people try to forgive the bandit, so they can get on with a reasonable life.  After all, he's the one that's really going to have a REALLY painful life, especially if he molests his own children.  That's the only reason for forgiveness: to get beyond it.  There's no other reason for forgiveness.|`|CJdsTmZRaa	yes you should tell her|`|MbCbhvloaa	YES, YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR MOM. IDK WHY U HAVN'T MAYBE CUZ YOU FEEL ITS YOUR FAULT FOR LETTING HIM BUT IT WAS NOT OKAY........ I KNOW WAT YOU MEAN ABOUT CUTTING, IT DOES **** U OVER AND MAKES U FEEL LIKE **** AND THAT THERE IS NO OTHER ESCAPE. BUT YOU NO IF YOUR SISTER REALLY CARES ABOUT U SHE WILL PUT THAT GUY IN JAIL FOR BEING A FUCKIN SICK BASTERD. IN MY EXPERIENCE COUNSELING DIDN'T HELP BUT EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT .....MAYBE IT WILL FOR YOU. BUT PLZ TELL SOME ONE BECAUSE MY UNCLE MOLESTED ME I SAID NOTHING AND HE ENDED UP MOLESTING ALL MY YOUNGER COUSINS .......SO SPEAK UP LET HIM KNOW WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG TAKE CARE .....OH YEAH CUTTING IS  NOT A PHASE BUT U WILL GROW SOME WHAT OUT OF IT AND DO IT OTHER RANDOM DAYS JUST LETTING YOU KNOW TAKE CARE BYE..
2EXL8qwaaa	well i can tell you that both advil cold and sinus and robitussin are resp depressants which sow your breathing if you are having a run with sleep apnea it could be dangerous, only way to know for sure is to have a sleep study done then they will be able to confirm it.|`|nUBCopgeaa	You should probably seek a doctor at a sleep disorder clinic. Mind you I am assuming that you have sleep apnea aside from the flu. Sleep apnea is dangerous period. Depending on the severity It can cause  several pulmonary diseases and heart disease. Sleep apnea is actually hard on the heart.    But we do have natural reflexes. There are several causes of sleep apnea. One being neurological the other being extra tissue. I would suggest sleeping on your side.

FPBTssUHaa	hi.  sorry to tell you that if you diet the healthy way then it will be a while to see the results you want to see like a dress size smaller.  im in the same boat i keep losing 2 pounds a week, i have been on this since a month now but that means in a month iv lost half a stone, i can tell i lost it on my legs and face but not on my belly where i desperately want it to go!!!     so i say be patient you'll get there maybe it'll take half a yr to get where you want but that's only if you stick to it, the sad part is if you do more exercise it will go quicker, but its having the time to do that.  good luck and stick with it, just think this time next year you'll be the size you want to be!!|`|05SbMDA6aa	A size 10 doesn't sound very big which is why you are probably finding it hard to loose.  It is always harder once you are nearing your target weight.  The body being as it is does not loose more weight healthily other than 1 to 2 pounds a week - the rest is usually loss of liquid which can be regained just as easily.  For promising results you need patience and time.  A good weight loss is usually 1 stone in 2 months (it will go by quickly too).  Try to loose weight easily by chosing healthier meal options such as cottage cheese instead of full fat cheese & reeducate yourself as to food options.  This way you are able to eat enough to satisfy yourself without going hungry and is a more realistic method of keeping the weight off.|`|f8e72c6f0fb6056040e7f9fa1c5247aaaa	Jesus, people just don't have any patience these days.    If you work hard, you'll lose 2-3lbs a week. It'll probably take about a month or so to really notice it in yourself, as you see yourself every day.    Eat less, do more.|`|dua2M0O7aa	well it depends on your size   the bigger you are the more you lose quicker  the slimmer you are the longer it will take  don't worry about when you will benefit just keep doing it !!|`|gC57M5TYaa	Dont lose patience yet your only a week in to it. excercise and diet are a positive lifestyle change that should stay with you for life. You may see a good result this week and perhaps next week too. And then you should expect it to settle and be losing 1 or 2 lbs a week that is sustainable amount  to lose per week. I would say dont weigh/measure yourself everyday because you fluctuate. Pick a day and time each week (mornings are best) to do your weekly weigh and measure that way you sill get the most accurate results. Lots of luck. x|`|Qz3sii2caa	If you're doing it right, you should have seen/felt some results already. Gosh, a week? You just started! Give yourself at least a month before you start whining.

Start exercising regularly    Keep a food diary, sure stick to a plan if you want but be real about it.    You can expect to lose between 1 and 2lbs a week depending the starting point.  Unless you are very overweight any more than that is likely to be just fluid loss and will just come back as soon as you stop.    for a 1lb loss you need a deficit of around 500kg, you can use the Harris Benedict equation to predict your RMR and then factor in your exercise rate.|`|sF13O9Fmaa	It depends how much over weight you are and amount of excess fluid you are carrying, a week isn't long though, if you do extra exercise that will also help.|`|ReTPKcfEaa	i would say 3 or 4 weeks.  if your exercising as well as cutting back food you will see results A HELL of a lot faster  i  kno how you feel you diet SO well in a week feeling like rubbish and you dont see or feel much different another week or so and you should see results.  make sure your diet is like sustainable so you dont feel the urge to binge!

AA10764658	Just because he has no signs doesn't mean that he doesn't have it!    Cold Sores Overview  Cold sores are caused by a viral infection that attacks the skin and nervous system. Cold sores are small, painful, fluid-filled blisters on the mouth or nose.    Cold Sore Causes  Cold sores are caused by the virus known as herpes simplex type I (HSV-1). After the first episode of the disease, the virus lies dormant in the nerves or skin around the original area until something sets the virus off into another eruption. Colds, flu, and even stress can cause you to have an outbreak of cold sores. Why you have an outbreak at one time of life and not another is not clearly understood.    HSV-1 is different from herpes simplex type II (HSV-2), which is the virus that causes the sexually transmitted disease known as genital herpes.   HSV-1 is a very common virus. It is thought that 90% of adults have been exposed to the virus during their lifetime.   Cold Sore Symptoms  The first symptom that may appear during an outbreak of cold sores may include tingling, burning, or itching in the area around the mouth or nose. This first portion of the outbreak is known as the prodromal stage or period.   Within a few hours to days, the area may become reddened and develop small fluid-filled blisters. Several of these small blisters may even come together and form one large blister.   When to Seek Medical Care  If you notice that there is pus (a yellow-white fluid that is filled with bacteria or virus) in any of your sores or if you develop a fever higher than 100.5F or if you have any irritation to the eyes, call your doctor.    If you have any disease that causes your immune system to be weak and unable to fight off regular diseases such as cancer and HIV, call your doctor. Also inform your doctor about any new lesions or sores that develop. You might prevent some of the more serious complications that may occur with herpes simplex I with your early communication with your doctor.    If you become confused, have a high fever, or are unable to swallow, go to a hospital's Emergency Department. Further treatment may be needed, and special tests may be required.    Exams and Tests  Diagnosis of cold sores is usually done by examination of the cold sores. Usually people with cold sores have a history of similar episodes in the past. Furthermore, there is then no need for any laboratory tests to be done, except for people with weakened immune systems for whom the risk of spreading is greatly increased. Special tests may be done on samples of fluid taken from the sores, if the diagnosis is unclear.    Cold Sore Treatment   Self-Care at Home     The blisters of HSV-1 contain the virus that causes cold sores. Without proper hygiene, this virus can be very contagious. This is why it is important if you have cold sores to wash your hands often, especially after you may have touched your face. Do not share cups or utensils with another person.    ----------------------------------  Cold sore blisters usually break open, weep clear fluid, and then crust over and disappear after a few days.     Other symptoms may include:    A sore mouth that makes eating, drinking, and sleeping uncomfortable. Cold sores can be painful.   A fever.   A sore throat.   Swollen lymph nodes in the neck.   Drooling, in small children.   You may not develop cold sores when you are first infected with HSV. If cold sores do develop when you are first infected, they may be more severe than in later outbreaks. During the first outbreak of cold sores, the blisters may spread to any part of the mouth.    After you become infected, HSV remains in your body and may cause cold sores to return throughout your lifetime (recurrent cold sores). Most people have 1 to 12 outbreaks a year but have fewer outbreaks as they get older.1    Recurrent cold sores usually develop where facial skin and the lip meet. About 6 to 48 hours before a cold sore is visible, you may feel tingling, burning, itching, numbness, tenderness, or pain in the affected area. This is called the prodromal stage.    Some common triggers that cause cold sores to return include:    Sunlight exposure, especially on the lips.   Stress.   Fatigue.   Other infections, such as a cold or influenza.   Food allergies.   Dental treatment.   Injury to the lips or gums.   An impaired (weak) immune system, either because of medicines (such as corticosteroids) or because of an autoimmune disease.   Cosmetic surgery, such as dermabrasion or laser skin resurfacing.   Hormonal changes in women caused by the menstrual cycle.   Pregnancy.   People who have weakened immune systems are more likely than those with strong immune systems to have longer or more severe outbreaks of cold sores. HSV infection may be life-threatening in certain people with weak immune systems.|`|387f6c8511dc708488cdb19cf6a783daaa	The cold sore virus can lay dormant in your body for years until something 'wakes' it up i.e. too much sun, stress or an illness. You need to use an acyclovir cream as soon as possible and follow the instructions. The best time to use the cream is when you feel the 'tingling' just before the full blown sore develops. If the sore has already developed then it usually takes between 2-3 weeks to clear up. Once you've had one cold sore you are open to more and I'm afraid there is no cure.|`|H5RF5w4daa	they can be passed with a kiss, a cup out realy but zoverax is the best to get rid|`|wVXurcqIaa	A cold sore is an outbreak of the herpes virus. I have suffered coldsores since childhood and they are very unpleasent. You can catch them simply by drinking from the same cup as someone. Ifyou give or recieve oral sex from someone with a coldsore you will develop herpes down below...so dont! You will find that the coldsore will start off itchy and blister like but will turn dry and scabby over the next few days, usually disappearing within a week or so. I have tried many creams etc but i find that vaseline is best because it keeps it moist and prevents cracking.  It will be whenever you are run down mentally or ill that you will get an outbreak, because they come out when your immune system is low

Sh0IBwClaa	Well I am an avid diet drinker because I am a diabetic...and I guess I am not sure what the complete answer is but they are saying that the artificial sweeteners in the diet soda tend to make people crave sweet foods. So in many cases they swap out the liquid calories, but they eat more. I am not sure if it is true or not, but I do get sweet cravings. The best choice is wat|`|svYdi7lNaa	ahmm......since people think its ok to drink diet sodas...they will tend to drink it more...but remember its still a soda...it may not have any sugar or whatsoever...but there are different kinds of sugar,besides the sugar we know...and too much sugar is bad for the body...plus its a carbonated drink, you might feel more thirsty because its not really rehydrating you...so you drink more because you feel thirsty...|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I drink diet coke all the time  if I try regular coke I can tell the difference  right away the reg tastes like syrup to me too sweet & heavy  so I'm sticking with my DC|`|9XmJPjXvaa	Research has shown that along with possible health concerns with sugar substitutes and caffeine overuse, the effectiveness of diet soda as a weight loss tool should also be considered.  A study at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, actually suggested the opposite, where consumption of diet soda was correlated with weight gain. The findings come from eight years of data collected by Sharon P. Fowler, MPH,. and colleagues.  Their report stated that soft drink use was linked to overweight and obesity and for those people who only drink diet soft drinks, their risk of obesity was even higher.  In fact, when the researchers took a closer look at their data, they found that nearly all the obesity risk from soft drinks came from diet sodas.  They also found that there was a 41% increase in risk of being overweight for every can or bottle of diet soft drink a person consumes each day.    An independent study by the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts, shows that the consumption of diet soda correlates with increased metabolic syndrome. 9,000 males and females were studied and the findings stated that 48% of the subjects were at higher risk for weight gain and elevated blood sugar.  The researchers also acknowledged that diet soda drinkers were less likely to consume healthy foods, and that drinking diet soda flavored with artificial sweeteners more than likely increases cravings for sugar flavored sweets.|`|b509379a7e02c1dc879390e409d8dc95aa	because the sugar substitute and caffeine stimulate your appetite waking up your brain and says lets eat, drink decaf green tea all that soda is bad but remember ever thing in moderation|`|uJKTR4d2aa	I dont understand it. They say it takes longer to leave your body because of the fake sugar which will make you retain water weight. But that also doesnt make sense because after one work out its all out of my body.       I love coke. i used to drink a lot, around 1000 calories alone on coke. so im saving calories on that now about 250 per each time i drink a diet drink.    I dont think there is anything wrong with it as long as you dont over do it as with all things|`|7swefA6Paa	ive heard that the sweeteners and chemicals in a diet coke are not only horrible for you but also induce even more cravings than non diet drinks leading to binging

fDqCPBP3aa	Stop worrying. Many people have your situation. Evacuating is a natural thing. When you have to go, your body will tell you. You will not be able to stop it. If you do not go sit on the pot when you get the urge, you will evacuate in your underwear.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Its because your stools have turned to as hard as rock. The more you force it, the more it tears your rectum. That's why its advisable to discharge everyday so that the stools is still soft. You may have to go to a doctor who will pump some solution through your backside to loosen the content first before pumping it out again.
4yzxXO1haa	Unfortunately, at four years of age, Nicole can't really understand her sister's sickness and special needs. You should really try to schedule time alone with her, and take her out by herself every now and again for a special treat (I'm sure you will have a lot on your plate once the twins arrive, but do your best to keep it up - with a sick older sister and two new littlies, Nicole may feel more overlooked than ever. Try to involve her as much as possible with the babies, and try to get her to enjoy the role of big sister - letting her "help" with bathtime and whatnot, and telling her how helpful she is to have around). Explain to her that you love her very much, no less than Jade, however Jade is very sick and needs special care. Try to think of ways to bring them closer together. As sick as Jade is, they both need to understand they are both loved equally, and have no reason to make things difficult for one another. I know this is really hard to explain to little kids, but persevere and have patience, and I'm sure you can get the message through.  As for the preschool, can you contact the teachers there and have something done about Billy? Maybe it hasn't come to their attention yet. You should also talk to her about how to stand up for herself and deal with bullies - she may have to deal them again during primary and highschool.    All the best.|`|ULx2vAB1aa	make the time that you spend with jade and nicole equal. four year olds need a lot of attention, and so do cancer patients. but all you need to do is spend more time with nicole
J1AydXh9aa	yes, they work, but don't do it every day... building size and strength happens AFTER the workout and not during.  So in order to give your body a chance to recover and grow bigger and stronger, you need to let it rest of at least a couple of days.  Instead, do them 2 days per week and don't forget to do pullups and squats for an all-body workout... otherwise, you'll have serious muscle imbalances and really look odd with big pecs and nothing else

cJPOs7Tsaa	Maybe your gay.  Perhaps you connect with women better?  IDK, but there's women all around me who seem to be "converting".        Okay, so you're bi... have you ever tried a serious relationship with a woman? Or does gender not matter in terms of your feelings in regards to love? You say that you hate love, which I find impossible to believe. It just suggests to me that you have never found true love, and so you're depressed about it. I can't say whether or not the molestation incident is connected to your relationship issues today... you would know that better than anyone else I would think.    The world is full of people who'd rather not be in a romantic relationship- particularly guys. But everyone has a sex drive. My best advice to you is simply avoid relationships. Go spend some nights on the town, meet some attractive individuals (potential f__k buddies), and make it absolutely clear that you hate relationships and you're only interested in somebody to call on every once in a while for a romp in the hay- that's it. Just about any guy will be perfectly okay with that, - that is until he ends up in a serious relationship of his own, but no big deal right? - You'll have a few others you can call on ;-).    Keep your friends close, and your sex partners anonymous. Be good to yourself. Enjoy what life has to offer - take every opportunity to have fun and try new activities. Suicide??? C'mon, that's silly doncha think? That's a permanent solution to a temporary problem - don't do it.    I sincerely hope this has been helpful.  Have fun out there :-)|`|d9WUbMBmaa	I think you need to seek some kind of therapy. You may think you're fine, but clearly you aren't and the trauma is still having a big impact on your life.

If you do not believe me, ask God to reveal Himself to you tonight in your dream and ask Him if He is real; or ask God to speak to you and ask Him if He is real. Wait and see or hear what He reveals to you.    Also, play Christian music (89.7 FM available on radio or online), talk to God (in your head, or out loud), read the bible (bible.com free bible reading online) and attend a good church that believes that Jesus is God and follows what the bible says.|`|xTxfmGxDaa	You shouldn't seek answers on this website for something so serious like that.

7NMc3vlNaa	It can take about 2 weeks or so before it's back in full swing from fasting.  During fast, in about 3 days, the body will live off fat reseves, then start catabolizing muscle tissue, but water is essential      Do it gradually. It should take around two months if you follow a strict diet of eating small meals every hour.        well i been on a diet for 9 days now. my calorie intake is 1000-1200 calories. i also was drinking 1 -2 gallons of water a day. i lost 12 pounds in 9 days, but i think it does cause rapid weight loss but for only a short amount of time. but it also depends how active you are. if your are really active then your body is going to need more food to burn for energy. and since you would be eating 1000-1200 calorie like i was its going to use fat. but i suggest have a calorie intake that low take some vitamins as well. because your body wont be getting enough nutrients.          Unless you drastically restrict calories for a very long period of time, no permanent damage is done to your metabolism. I challenge anyone to dig up a study to prove otherwise.    That said, get a post-diet sluggish metabolism back on track while increasing calories, you should slowly add calories into your diet over the course of a few weeks, while INCREASING your exercise levels. Keep an eye on the scale and on your measurements.    The idea is to keep increasing calories while staying at the same weight. You will be increasing the rate of tissue turnover (read:metabolism) through all the exercise, while getting your body accustomed to a much higher food intake. After you have maxed out your exercise (6-8 hours a week), cut back on the exercise and your food intake just a bit, and then just monitor your progress to make sure you are not gaining or losing weight.    This is also a good strategy to use for a couple of weeks BEFORE going on a fat loss diet to get your metabolism really revved up before you reduce calories.|`|nSXqAj3paa	The body begins to adapt to excercise and diet after a 6 week period after which adjust your excercises.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Google a BMR calculator. That is your Basic Metabolic Rate, the number of calories your Metabolism burns by keeping you alive. This is, the number of calories your body needs to get in order for you to keep the same weight.    So you enter your height weight and gender and age, and that will give you the calories your body is consuming. If you want to lose weight, eat less than that number or exercise it off.    Bmr calculators will show you what your metabolism currently uses
aIZfiU6Kaa	I'm a recovered alcoholic but while our addictions may be poles apart, the principles are exactly the same, firstly that you want to do it.    To stop alcoholics from relapsing apart from other parts of our program, we look at all the benefits of giving up and add those to the consequences of not.    Alcoholics are taught, never take the first drink, so never take the first cigarette.    As with alcoholics, your addiction will continue to get worse and affect all those around you.    Good luck!

As much as it sounds wrong and the dentist seems like a real scumbag he has probably protected himself with a waiver of liability that you signed.

wi6mkT30aa	Hey hon! I feel your pain! Please don't worry because the only reason the numbers are going up on the scale is because you are gaining muscle! This is a good thing! Plus sometimes your weight will stay the same for awhile because you are gaining muscle, but that doesn't mean you aren't losing inches!    The best thing to do in this situation is to work out and eat well! I did this and lost 40lbs! I ate light and every other week I treated myself to something good.     If you weigh yourself every day you will drive yourself crazy! Honestly! I did that when I first started losing weight and I would get ticked off too! I was like WHAT? I ate perfectly all day and exercized and I am going up?!?!? I was so upset that I was really goign to give up! But I've learn that isn't the way it works.    The best way to do it is weigh yourself weekly! Every Tuesday was the day I weighed myself and I saw a much better progress than daily!       Please don't give up and DO NOT eat less because if you lose weight too fast, you will gain it REAL fast once you start eating any little thing! It sucks! Really just take your time with this! Eat well & exercize and I bet you will lose weight in no time! PLus you're lucky you're not even "Fat" to me! I wish I was your weight! lol    Good luck hon and don't give up! It will happen!|`|sF13O9Fmaa	You should be eating at least 1200 calories, if you don't eat enough it can have a negative effect. Make sure you are drinking lots of fluids (preferably water) and eat fruit and veg to help keep you regular, lowering your salt intake also stops your body from storing excess fluid.    It could be that you are constipated, holding fluid or gaining muscle, you should have a good weight loss next week.    Good luck!|`|SYccJO3Haa	Hi there - don't panic! You are most likely holding water. Water retention plays havoc with weight loss attempts. Is it the time of the month?!     I don't believe that eating less is the way to lose weight. I have researched overeating and obesity for c. 20 years and discovered that there are 3 things that your body does to work against you when you try and eat less: 1) you get hungry (that alone ruins most diets) 2) you lose lean muscle and store fat and 3) your metabolism slows down so that you need even fewer calories before you actually start putting on weight.    Check out the links below and there are free diet sheets to download. There is also a lot of info on three conditions, which I've researched at length and have found that they cause insatiable food cravings, bloating, water retention and all sorts. I would put money on you having at least one of them.    The secret to losing weight is to eat better - not less. This will make your body work with you, not against you. At the moment your body doesn't know you've gone on a diet - it thinks you've landed on a desert island and need saving!    Hope this gives you a starter for 10!  All the best - Zoe|`|3p7552z3aa	You have this thing called a basal metabolic rate. In which your body requires 1200 for your to operate. (you should add in a yogurt and a fruit in your diet to make it to that mark)    Here's the possible reasons.    1. you're gaining muscle. if you "replace" fistful of fat with muscle, you'll gain about 1/3 to 1/2 a pound.    2. you're under eating. Anything under 1200 is considered crashing. What happens is your body things you're undergoing a starvation period (an automatic response of the body) and starts to conserve energy (or not burn fat as quickly). As you exercise you gain muscle, yet don't lose much fat. This will lead to the quickest way of gaining weight in the beginning. Of course as your crash diet goes on, you body will break down fat to supply the needed energy. In short, you start off gaining weight for a while, (1-2 weeks) and then you'll shed like crazy. This is not a good effect as you will be breaking down your proteins/muscle energy storage.    3. water retension. Someone mentioned it so i won't explain again. But to cure this effect, (it's going to seem contradictory) drink MORE water. It allows your body to wash out toxins and realize "oh hey, she's not going to dehydrate me! i can allow more water into my urine now!"      4. There was a psychological study that if you look at your weight every day you don't lose weight. ( mind over matter? i don't believe this completely, but hey it's something)    5. THIS IS IMPORTANT. did you weight your self at the same time each day? Your weight varies throughout the day. I generally gain about 5 pounds from morning to night.    6. constipation or bowel discomfort can indicate the hold up on your Gastrointestinal track (digestive track). If you feel like you can't relieve your feces, try to eat more fiber or see a doctor.|`|466d0df8a4110fb75f51028e25c34d52aa	DO NOT worry about counting calories  Before each meal - Eat at least 1 whole raw fruit or vegetable with 8 ounces of water (this will almost guarantee you'll never overeat and gain weight because this will make you feel full & satisfied quicker)  Stop eating at each meal when you feel 100% satisfied but DO NOT go overboard & stuff yourself full   If you do get hungry in between meals (which you probably won't) - Just snack lightly  Only drink water, raw vegetable juice, or Green tea|`|UVdviQMPaa	Eating and movements can account for these four pounds easily depending upon timing for weighing.

GBG2hbQ4aa	Probiotics are terrific to build a healthy immune system.  However, when you are taking an antibiotic, it's best to suspend probiotics.  The antibiotic is meant to kill off pathological bacteria, but antibiotics are not specific and so will become engaged in killing off the friendly bacteria in the probiotic.  That not only cancels out the probiotic, it also uses up a certain amount of the potency of the antibiotic in the process, leaving less available to kill off the bad bacteria.    Once you are done with your course of amoxicillin, then by all means increase probiotics for a time.  I increase my probiotics to roughly 6X my normal dose for 7-10 days after an antibiotic treatment.

It shouldn't be a chore, it should be like "playing" like when you were a kid.    Me, I enjoy cycling - when the weather is perfectly sunny, It's not hard at all to find an excuse to go for a spin (aka "getting some fresh-air")    And have a real goal to aim for - not weight-loss but a physical goal based on endurance. It might be an up-coming fun-run, a long hike or something else you might aspire to.    Keep it fun & try to incorporate in your everyday routine.

The test isn't 100% right but  don't freak out yet. It could be an irrgular period not a big deal. But two week after the date that you had sex go to a doctors office and get a test. If it is negitive then go to ur gynacologist just in case. That is really all I can say to help. I hope it is nothing. Good luck though
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|KppM3VzAaa	You don't want to lose weight too fast, 1kg / week is a good way. To be shaping up and slimming down you need to reduce your body fat and tone your muscle. Going to the gym and eating correctly will do this.    Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day and do exercise too.

7uV0SAWnaa	Depression can drive people to suicide . It seems that she has used the drugs that has been precribed to treat depression.  Paracetamol overdosage alone definitely can damage her liver - 20-30 tablets within  24 hours can kill. Antidotes like acetylcysteine or methionine protect the liver if given within 10 hours of ingestion - perhaps given even later like 24 hours or beyond. If she lives , make sure to keep all drugs away from her. Whether she will be able to live or not depend upon the quality of her medical treatments. She has taken 48 paracetamol tablets alone. If her kidneys and liver is already damaged , there is little even medical profession can do. Other antidepressants may even cause brain death. Serious.|`|FfLLUr3Aaa	I am hoping that the hospital has pumped her stomach QUICKLY. It only takes about 12000mg of paracetamol (aka acetaminophen) to be fatal. If the stomach isn't pumped immediately, the drug can cause receptors in the brain to shut down. Normally, this kills pain receptors, but too much can run awry and begin to block signals in the brain needed to keep vital organs functioning properly. If enough has gotten into the body, it cannot be reversed and can take up to three weeks to cause death.    You must pray and leave the rest to the powers that be.     When she comes out of the hospital, you must be there for her more than you ever have. I hope she is well, both physically and mentally. I'm sure you can help.|`|45d9655f6a2cbde73654678de6d8cf03aa	Since you asked I'm giving it to you plain.     Paracetomol overdoses are the leading cause of liver failure in the Western world, even low overdoses. That high of one, unless they have gotten it out of her system, her liver's shot.    Depending on the artificial sweetener, it could be nothing or it could lead to hemorrhaging.    Levoxyl can lead to hyperthyroidism if they didn't get it out of her system.    Only 1% of zoloft overdoses lead to death, but they have the possibility to leading to hypertension.    Again, if they caught these early enough then likely nothing will happen. It all depends on if they did the stomach pump quick enough.|`|qcjAg3yOaa	Shes in Gods and the hospitals hands now.

Best wishes for your friend.|`|AA12359017	My dear, if they got her soon enough to have her stomach pumped, she may make it.  She will probably have to have some treatment to get all of the stuff out of her liver.  That is what's damaged the most from something like this.    What you need to be concerned with if she is OK is why she took all of this.  It seems that she was trying to commit suicide.  I pray that she can overcome whatever drove her to do this if she did it on purpose.    I wish only the best and you too my dear.  This must be a very bad time for you.  Pray for her.

Fjm7RnD2aa	You sound as if you have low self esteem. People in the past have told you to sms and as you said you got used to it. The thing is there is no reason why you don't start phoning people now or suggesting you meet up and talk. You are not crazy but if people tell you you are all these different things like 'weird, disturbing'  then because of your low self esteem you start to worry if this is true. You then probably act a little more nervous and text a little more frequently because of your worry. Stop texting unless it is to answer someone's text to you. Do not listen to the negative comments about you being very weird. If need be get yourself some new friends. You are worth more than putting up with people being nasty to you. They are saying upsetting things and you are getting upset and depressed by their comments. You now have to choose to not listen to their comments and stop texting them as they are not worth getting upset over!|`|pQ10zbcDaa	Maybe you are just stretch out so thin because of family problems that i don't i am just assuming though, stress though can lead to a bad habit and later would become your character which indeed disturbing at the end, depression is somewhat caused by our inability to cope up with our daily lives, why don't you try to take time alone going vacation a change of scenery could help a lot..and by the way there is nothing wrong with you...|`|4WbYCWbCaa	Tht is not a sickness.. try to look back your question, you will find it will be funny or rubbish.

9hngdgzlaa	Well, I have to say peoples advice never held any sway to get me to quit using drugs and alcohol. I totally wanted their advice when things went bad for me but never took it (I think I just liked the attention), I always thought I was smarter than them. When I was up and having a good time I resented their advice and wanted them to leave me alone.     Understand this coming from me, a drug addict who knows - addicts are manipulators, they are selfish, spineless, romantic, narcissistic liars who love people but not near as much as they love feeling good. We come in all shapes and sizes with all sorts of different addictions. We quit when we get good and ready and only when we can face the truth and begin to tell the truth, no matter what. No person ever told me that, I had to find it out on my own.    Advice: "fake it til you make it" (just plain stupid and vague), "prayer and God can take away your cravings and heal you" (partially true but not like magic, it's a trial), "Keep coming to AA/NA" meetings (makes your addiction the center focus of your life), "talk to someone" (I never listen), "Get married to someone who will keep you straight" (you'll make them miserable).    Addiction is a mindset not at all easily overcome, I'm still trying to beat it everyday. Even though I have not used illegal drugs in 20 years and stopped drinking many years ago I have had trouble with any prescription I ever took that altered my normal state, even over the counter stuff. I am still married after 20 years but my personality causes much emotional pain to those I love. I am working on it.    Hope that answers your question. Advice is good - just not real effective.
WupyR6UEaa	I would get to a Dr.  Your Dr. needs to do some tests to see if you are on your way to a heart attack or stroke.  The next time it happens, either get your Dr. on the phone or go to the ER.  This does not sound like something I would wait on.  Symptoms of a heart attack can be pain on the left side, going up your arm.  You don't say how old you are or any medical conditions.  Heart attacks can happen at any age!  You may have pulled a muscle or a rib could be out of alignment, but only a Dr. can tell.  Heart attack symptoms, the pain can also be in your back, not just limited to your chest or left arm.  I would still see the Dr. fairly soon.  Good Luck!    Rx Tech

Anywhere from two to seven days is normal. For the first few years after menstruation begins, longer cycles are common.    Having an orgasm will not prolong your period.     Usually, there are only four to six tablespoonfuls of blood in the whole flow. This is a small amount. The rest is bits of the unused lining and other fluids. By the time your period ends, the flow will have amounted to between half a cup and a full cup of liquid.|`|87e0ded175c7b1e6686806afc8bb6b44aa	Okay a Period usually last from 5-7 days, But everyone is different Some could last three days and some could be 8 or 9.

I can't even imagine the kind of pain you are in, you poor thing! That is such an unheard of injury! I would imagine you are constantly in pain because your muscles are trying to constantly compensate for your pectorial muscle. Your oblique muscles are probably the worst. As you probably know , muscles work in pairs, always working with another muscle.  Your muscle being detached is absolutely horrific and probably so straining on your other muscles surrounding. I would imagine you're just always going to be on pain medication, but if you are still in pain that much, you should consider seeing a pain management doctor and explain the medicine is not helping. In the meantime I would suggest you just try to limit use of the muscles that hurt as much as possible, maybe even taking hot baths and warm compresses may help the muscles also. Also try to have an adequate intake of potassium as it helps your muscles work more efficiently. Good luck to you and stay strong! Sounds like you are anyway!

v6Ka4gwbaa	Hello,     Hey I am going to keep my opinions to myself as we all should, even when we don't always agree with others choices. Anyways, a few years back a co-worker that I worked with had an abortion and hers was at 8 weeks. She used to talk to me about it, and this is what she told me.     She said that they gave her two pain pills a half an hour before hand, (this was to help relieve some of the pain that would be felt during the procedure) and during it, the worst was the suctioning of the baby (I don't like how that sounds, suctioning of the baby, but that's what she said) Anyways, she said that the doctor before hand examined her, gave a shot to her uterus for numbing purposes, and she didn't even feel it.     The worst was about 2 minutes of the suctioning. She said it felt like cramping the same as when she was on her period, but a little worse. She also said that right after she bled, but it wasn't bad and she had a little cramping then and for a few days after. She also said that for a few days after she passed blood clot things, but eventually they went away and she was OK. She said that all of this was normal and it wasn't all that bad, except the guilt and pain of what she did is what is causing her to feel pain as of now.     I am telling you this because I don't want you to make the same decision she made, and then live like hell like she does now. She thought an abortion is what she wanted, and she has such guilt that she literally wants to die herself because she just can't let it go.     I am not going to tell you what to do, all I will say is please with whatever you choose, think about things through thoroughly, and make the decision based on non selfishness. I would hate to think that you would live with the hell that my friend lives with now. It's not a pretty picture, and this kills her every single day. She'll never get over this and or I think learn to deal with it. It was so traumatic for her that she now has PTSD.      Hope my info helps, and with whatever lies ahead for you, just please promise to think things through, because once a decision is made there's no going back.|`|TM3pNz6kaa	Abortion is a decision you will have to make. But it is not an easy decision. Its a decision that seems to be an easy way out to a situation that will haunt you for the rest of your life.  Some feel pain during an abortion, and some do not feel pain during an abortion. Its the emotional pain that you will carry with you. Its the emotional pain that you will remember.  I know some people carry guilt and grief with them for what they did and some never look back on the day of their abortion. And miss the child that you never hold, kiss, or watch grow up.|`|8MudYsoaaa	When i went to get mine i was 15 years old.    I was in a waiting room and they gave me a couple pain pills about 30mins before i had it done. They also took me into a little room to have a ultra sound to see how far along i was, shes asked me if i wanted to see the picture of my baby and i said no, but the picture was printed out and when she walked by i saw it, and this haunts me.  I was 8 weeks along.    I had to spread my lets and they put this thing inside of me and it was a lot of sucking and cramping. Very very uncomfortable.  It wasn't the most painful thing, but it did hurt a little bit with the cramping. After i was done they put me in this little room and gave me some juice and crackers and a big pad to put on. Than after 15 mins or so i left.    I had more cramping and lots of blood clots for about 7-10 days. Like most people said it was more emotional pain, than anything else.    Anyway good luck with everything|`|1thElV58aa	This video is graphic... the girl is in a lot of pain...      I never been pregnant so I wouldnt know...|`|Ux9lRTaSaa	to the first answerer-  Although I am pro-life, there is NOT always a way to have a baby.  Especially if it will kill the mother and/or baby.    Well, I'm sorry, but I really wouldn't know.  I heard they knock you out, and go and take the baby out,  but I'm pretty sure that's not the way they do it.  idk, I'm sorry, I'm not much help.|`|yUnQahGoaa	The only pain killer they gave me was one advil before hand. I didn't end up needing it tho. I felt a little pressure and a small amount of cramping for a moment or two. The whole procedure takes like 5-6 mins. I really didn't feel anything physically. Emotionally scared for life, even tho I don't like children and don't want one, but it's a haunting thing. Depending on how far along you are, you may be able to do it medically. They give you a pill that does it. I've heard you have pretty bad cramps for like 6 hrs tho. But I did it the other way. Good Luck! If you have any more ?s or need someone to talk to about this, send me an e-mail I'd be happy to help.|`|Z7TzJWX4aa	it's sad that you feel that way.  there is ALWAYS a way for you to have your baby.    if you really would love to, you would find a way.|`|FRE2gov3aa	They gave me one painkiller and it didn't do anything.    It's just real bad cramping is all.  And some pain down there but it's just like going to the gyno for a pap.    It wasn't the physical pain that affected me.  It's been the emotional pain that kills me all the time.    I had one and am not proud but I can't change what happened.    Good luck to you.|`|ImQPqxEgaa	It is painful the first day but usually not enough for serious pain meds. If you ask, they might but you just really need to be sure to follow the directions they give you and take the meds they suggest &/or prescribe when you are supposed to. They they will probably give you an antibiotic, if so be sure to take it as prescribed. It is unlikely you will be left hanging since you will likley be given an emergency   and a follow-up exam or number.    You will probably feel discomfort for a day or two - and I understand this is more wierd than painful. You may have to take it easy a day or two but not knowing more of the facts, you should be ok and not totally miserable. Stay hydrated keep up with your electrolytes and your rest. Try to stay away from negative or stressed out people. Take care and be good to yourself :)|`|oaJcgz3uaa	It honestly depends on the stage of your pregnancy.  If it is early enough, the fetus can be aborted by taking a combination of pills.  Some of the symptoms can be painful (uterine cramping) described as being similar to spontaneous miscarriage.  The level of cramping pain ultimately depends on the person.  This procedure is not surgical, so I imagine it is the least painful.    There is also a surgical procedure for early pregnancies that has cramping as a possible side effect.  Again, the level of pain depends on the person, but they provide a pain reliever during the procedure.  The pain generally lasts only as long as the procedure.    The later pregnancy surgical procedure may have more severe cramping.  Just as the others, the level of cramping depends on the person.    I would suggest that you try to relax as much as you can - anxiety most likely increases the pain.  Try some breathing exercises, or some other relaxation technique.|`|OG3lycSPaa	you should watch juno|`|lHmfSDIYaa	Only for the physical pain.  The emotional and spiritual pain last a lifetime for all involved.|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	They are not that painful.  You will be given drugs to relax you, and then some pain relief.  You won't be in a lot of pain, just slightly uncomfortable like having your period.  Don't listen to people that judge you, this is your decision and your business.  Take care xx  P.S - everyone is different, some women will get cramping bad, some it's just like a period.  It's an individual thing.  Also, you shouldn't have to explain your reasons why to anyone!  I can't believe some people!  Good luck!
5INu2kzdaa	if you are sexually active you need to make sure it's not chlamydia or ghonnerea! yellow discharge is a common symptom for these stds|`|EtubnxJSaa	like i said before, it might be the food or drink you put into your body.   that's what mainly comes out of it.
7uV0SAWnaa	Orgasms don't happen behind your eyes. Clearly, you don't know the right word to describe the sensation you feel behind your eye as a side effect of fluoxetine - which may be serious if it is an internal bleeding- one of the side effects of prozac. See your doctor immediately. Otherwise, you may not experience any orgasms in the future.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	LOL!! Orgasm! ;D  Haha, you mean spasm!     It's a muscle spasm. You could be having a reaction to the medicine, to bright lights, to stress or could be the start of a sign of something else. (There are names for specific twitches in ceretain areas of the body, even all around the eyes.) You should call your dr. since you're on medicine, otherwise I'd say relax a few days...seriously chill & see if it's stress or light related then ask your dr.|`|nRGELSqVaa	Think you mean organism not orgasm!|`|LXyyA4Uvaa	You've got three seconds - three seconds, private before I gouge out your eye and skull-**** you!    ...and you'd like it.|`|v7UR00HLaa	Yes.
3kyn9ltvaa	Since living outside Russia where I ate about 1000 calories per day, I only eat about 500 and I feel very healthy. I live in a warm tropical climate which makes this easier.  I am a 17 year old Male    Also - The healthiest way to be is making your body feel satisfied. The above answer is encouraging you to eat beyond what you want just because you are at a certain age. It is very incorrect to eat more than what makes you feel good.|`|U35u1uEzaa	yes defiantly 1300 cals per day is not healthy for a teen especially if you are moderatly active your body is growing and you need those calories i would never go below 1200 as an adult and thats even low thats only if you need to lose weight i myself can eat 1500 a day and steady lose weight  as long as you are eating the right kind of foods i wouldnt count calories at your age stick to whole grains and fruits and veggies lots of lean protein as well and you should be fine you want to lose the weight at a slow pace id say 1-2 lbs per week if you have any desire to keep it off
J1AydXh9aa	the rule of thumb is 13 calories per body weight.  So for example, if you're 180 lbs, your minimal calorie intake should be about 2,340 (180 x 13 = 2,340).  Anything less than that and your body will literally eat itself for the extra energy... and that's not healthy for a growing, 16 year old boy.|`|81gRBhu1aa	yes!!!! A boy his age should at LEAST 1800, and that is if he wants to lose weight. If he active, he should consume at 2100. If he works out or plays sports, then he should consume 2500. If he wants to build muscle while he works out, then he should consume 3000.
AA11754206	first off since its your first time you don't need lube unless your girlfriend isn't very wet when you get her excited, which normally only happens in older people, or you are doing anal. but any ky is good if you think you just have to have lube and for condom always use a Trojan never his pleasure because they are made with thinner latex which means they break easier which you don't want.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	To be honest this isn't a question that can really be answered. The reason there are so many different types of condoms is because different people find different ones to be the best. It's a hit and miss thing! You shouldn't need any lube-you can produce natural lube if you use plenty of foreplay with your girlfriend (but remember, do not enter her until your penis has a condom on as even pre ejaculate can get a girl pregnant!).     Just get a few different types of condoms and have a bit of experimentation! If you are in the UK, then Mates are the most popular. In the US I think Trojan are the most popular.    And relax and enjoy yourself! Also, can i recommend your girlfriend goes on the contraceptive pill?|`|eDX2ESrcaa	spermacidal, not sure exactly how you spell it. It kills sperm so less likely for pregnancy.

I find whenever I eat wheat (ie. pasta, bread, anything like that) I get exhausted immediately afterwards. Try eliminating certain things from your diet for a trial period and see if it makes any difference.  Either that or maybe you're just suffering from a monotonous life? Do you dislike your job or routine?   Or is something disrupting you during the night- uncomfortable sleep? Loud partner snoring?|`|sajQ9HMVaa	hi you could have sleep apnea wich would make you tired also go to the docs and get your thyroid checked . good luck

CCELJSbsaa	Is there any way you  could be pregnant? This is how I felt.
f4doqdSCaa	Seems to me that you could benefit from some serious therapy, my friend.  A few points: Yes, I think that playing the violent video games is counter-productive and is fueling your violent tendencies.  A lot of behaviors you have described are worrisome, but the fact you haven't acted on them is good, and the fact that you are aware that they aren't considered 'normal' is also good.  If your thoughts are tormenting you so much that you are even slightly considering suicide, you need to seek help, asap.    I think the fact that you posted this, that you are concerned about it, and that you are aware that you need help and that this wouldn't be considered typical behavior, is an indicator that you are not 'insane', but simply troubled and in need of help. Please get the help that you need. Best to you.|`|uCRZzB1Aaa	You need to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Do not be ashamed, this is common. I believe what you are is maybe a socialpath or schizophrenic.  It is NOT your fault! Seek medical attention and they will be able to give you therapy and medication to help this and you will be ok. Do not hurt anybody as that will lead you down a road you do not want to go down. Go to the emergency room NOW, call 911. Please. For your sake and the sake of others. Good luck. Take care.|`|pdYjQ9Dvaa	Grab a punching bag beat the @(!& out of it and sit down and relax ;)|`|9o8lEBSnaa	Video games don't make people violent.    I believe you should seek medical help though.|`|2f31b4d39ae1b04efdb601126bd63100aa	It sounds like you could possibly be developing a mental disorder.  More likely you are just suffering from a chemical imbalance.  However, the good news is that you recognize this kind of behavior is not rational, so you can do something about it.  You can get medication or find a outlet for your rage.  Buying a "heavy bag" for boxing is a great way to work off anger and frustration.  If you are comfortable talking to a medical professional, find one and discuss your feelings.  They can get you medication and therapy (neither of which should cause you shame or embarssment.  They are great ways to help).  If you don't feel comfortable, then work on finding physical ways to divert your anger, like punching the heavy bag.|`|15138853c1cb3b1c3ba1e3d5ca6a8aecaa	Dear X,    See, from what I see your problem seems to be a compound of problems on mental and spiritual plane. First, stop playing violent games and reading violent stories.....they certainly fuel the anger and rage and give rise to fantasies and nightmares that are always worse than before.    Secondly, I will suggest you to contact a trusted medium in your area as well as a psychologist. However, if the psychologist starts toying with your ideas and do not gives credit to your feelings, he or she is not worth it. Medium will help you get in touch with your problem on spiritual problem.    Read good books. Trust me, religious books like Bible, Quran or Geeta help. Pick up any book you have faith in and read it - not as a holy book but as a book of learning. Pray and meditate before going to bed. You might feel as if I am preaching but I have been through what you are currently facing and I am telling you that it helps.     Tell the demons that you are not going to let them win. Whenever you feel hatred for someone, keep your mouth shut. Avoid arguments altogether....no matter how much you want to beat the crap out of the bugger. Just turn and go.     Whenever, you feel afraid, call upon God and your Guardian Angel and pray to them to protect you. Then, keep doing things like they should be done. Paranoia, Mental Problem or Spiritual Problem...whatever it is. It is You who has to cure it and You will, if only you trust in Your Healing Powers. The more you starve Rage, Fear and Anger, weaker they become. Don't give up the fight. You are the one who is the Master of your Mind and your Life. Don't let it be taken away from you.|`|1b40d00c158a682c5478cdb40c9f4dc5aa	You are aware of these things, and yet you talk about yourself as if you are watching what you are doing as another person.   Firstly, ask yourself this question; Do you feel bad about these thoughts?  Secondly, are you willing to "own" these feelings as trully your own?  If you aswered yes to both, then you will be able to get help from a counsellor.  If you answered no to both, then you need to see a psychiatrist.  If you answered yes to the first, but no to the second question, you need to see a priest, as you will need to confess and/or have a demon excorcised from you. (Seriously)  If you answered no to the first and yes to the second you are likely to  need to see a counsellor AND a psychiatrist.  Believe me, I know about these things. You could have a demon making you think this way; especially if they are'nt what you would normally be thinking. Remember, demons seek to cause misery and pain to others.  If you're not sure, talk to a priest whom you can trust (not a Doctor who will put you under sedation and quite possibly not understand what is going on- unless he has practised psychiatry).|`|nyrXBf6kaa	You "live a healthy social life" besides the fact that you are going out and starting fights. I would say this is something you should look into seriously with a either a physiologist, therapist or anger management.     If you do not work & live at home maybe talk to your parents about what is going on in your mind. If you find that you are a danger to yourself or others admit yourself to your nearest mental hospital. They are not there to judge you, they are there to help you.    Saying things like "I also have thoughts of suicide", is a very clear sign that you need immediate attention. Do not ever take thoughts of suicide lightly, because you never know if you go into a fit of rage you might actually hurt or kill yourself, & not be able to control it.      I would give you a big hug if I could hun, I hope you get the help you need, & good luck!|`|733a18bc9b818b5f9d75e4032cd40880aa	I suggest you go to a mental health clinic or facility to be evaluated asap.  Also you should have a complete physical in case there is a medical reason for your condition.  There are all sorts of reasons for whats happening with you from schizophrenia to a brain legion or tumor/    Please seek immediate medical attention.  Good luck and please take care of yourself life is worth living and you can find joy once you receive the help you need,  Also if you do not have health insurance or money to pay for your appointment then go to a free clinic or hospital.  I would suggest you don't even wait for an appointment and go as a walk in for faster help if you feel you will soon act on these feelings.|`|7kwLZvE7aa	I think you need to have counseling, maybe an assessment, because it may even be hormones. Are you in your teenage years? Because I kinda went through similar but without the urge to kill someone, the desire was more to harm myself than others.

He is the GREAT PHYSICIAN.|`|AkZ1xWDKaa	Do not feel bad or ashamed, but you should probably seek more help than just this site on the internet.  Everyone gets upset and has bad feelings.  Eventually they will turn around if you can change your life and be patient.    The most important thing is that you do not get discouraged and hurt yourself or others!    Search for SUICIDE HOTLINE and call the number you find.  They will be able to help you.|`|wJJzYQsraa	Studies show that violent video games do contribute. I would talk to a doctor as quickly as possible.

Don't feel bad or embarrassed to see someone about this or talk to a counselor.

Thinking that your crazy.    If you think that your going crazy, your usually not. You can rationally define your actions and thoughts, and that is not something insane people can do.    The solution? you can go see a psychotherapist, but the thing that really worked with me is creating, as in writing, painting, creating art.  I used to have the same problem as you, but when i started writing it was as if i had opened a gate somewhere in my mind where all my hatred was locked up. I cleansed myself.    Also, start thinking about what caused this, this can help too..    I wish you the best of luck ;)|`|AkZwXYbRaa	There are various psychological problems that's related to anger. I think you have one of  those. I think you should better consult a psychiatrist. There's nothing wrong in you. You're not insane but still has some problems that needs to be solved. If it's proven that you have some sort of ANGER DISORDER, it is necessary that you treat it immediately.     HAve you ever heard of people being able to do unbelievable things just because of anger, then in the end, they say that they didn't mean it? or they are totally unaware of it while doing it?     There's nothing wrong to consult an expert for it. That is, if you still want to live a normal life without being angry for senseless reason... If you don't trust your family or friends enough, you can consult a psychiatrist for treatment...believe me... it's worth trying for..|`|CJdsTmZRaa	hmmmm|`|AFkmdu92aa	i don't think you are but maybe you should see someone i know it sounds completely stupid and no use but it will really help and they wont think your insane either.     i hope it works out:)|`|O5OVMi3caa	probably not insanity, lol its not its just not being able to regulate emotions and feelings, and beating up people is not cool, hey talk to a doc.|`|yEosR5Naaa	What do the voices tell you....|`|spXPpyP0aa	You are not insane unless you act on it.

One of the easiest ways to lose weight is to eat less food but more often. The way I do this is to divide my daily calorie maximum by six. Heres an example.    Lets say that I want to lose weight by eating only 1200 calories per day. Instead of eating 3 meals a day of 400 calories each, Im going to do it differently.    Instead, Im going to eat 6 meals a day of 200 calories each....read more here:    http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008...|`|EjDcshrlaa	Eat less and exercise more is really the only way ... but don't reduce too much though else you will harm your body in the long run and make it much harder to keep the weight off.  You might want to also consider refraining from eating sugar, white flour and other white refined products as these can simply have a drug-like reaction in your body and produce cravings, insecure feelings and other addiction like tendencies.

For a female the average consumption of calories varies depending on your age, weight, height, and activity level. Use a free calorie calculator to figure out how  many calories you should be taking in daily. This is just one link you can try:    http://www.csgnetwork.com/caloriesfemale...    Once you have found your daily calorie intake begin counting how many calories you're taking in currently and adjust it to fit what the calculator states. If it's anything under what you're currently taking in you'll begin to lose weight but how much weight depends on the reduction of calories. Remember that 3500 calories = 1 pound of body weight so let's say the calculator computes your daily calories to be 2000 subtract 500 and intake only 1500. You'll lose up to 4 pounds in a single month! Adjust the calories accordinly so that you're getting enough but not too much and you'll be good to go in as little as 2-3 months!|`|9XmJPjXvaa	go here http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com/    get a full access to the their program, community, and resources for 30 days for free.    quick enough?|`|200afe35d45dea8a4192b6e0e30ed767aa	I cut back on carbs and lost a ton of weight.

If she doesn't get pregnant, she has a period, and the cycle starts over.    If your period comes every 3 months for example, you will have less chances to get pregnant, but you will still have a chance.     If you're not having periods at all, it will be almost impossible.

It involves movements similar to "milking" your penis to increase the amount of blood, which fills Corpora Covernosa (the part of your penis that is filled with blood and enlarged during erections) thus making your penis visibly larger. The important fact is that jelqing, if performed regularly, can permanently increase the size of Corpora Covernosa and thus your penis size (both length and girth).  Penis Stretching.  There are several types of penis stretching exercises but their basic principle is the same: stretching the tissues of your penis. Stretching makes cells composing your penis grow increasing the length and girth (lesser effect) of your penis.  Kegel Exercises.  These exercises are not targeted at the penis itself but rather at the pubococcygeus muscle, which is used to delay erections. Thus, if you train this muscle, you will be able to prolong your erections.

9ko5WUFkaa	If she's enjoying it or not had nothing to do with her natural lubrication (well it does, but not exclusively).  Not all women respond the same, they have different levels of natural lubrication and some get dry quicker than others.  Part of the reason is that your fingers have no natural lubrication and especially if you pull them out and put them back in she will dry quicker.  Same goes with any penetrative sex, especially if it lasts a good period of time.  Its not like women have a tap that turns on when they get horny and stays on the whole time.  Damn, I've been as horny as hell and yet no natural lube.  Other times I've had no interest in having sex but the natural lube is plentiful.  It varies on the time of the month, my stress levels, all sorts of things.  Being on the pill or other hormonal contraception also makes a difference.  While it's not common, I have also become dry after an orgasm, usually it's the other way around but not always.    This is why they sell lubricants.  It's a great idea to always have a tube of lube for her (and your) sexual comfort - then when things dry up you don't have anything to worry about.  Dry friction is really uncomfortable for a girl (and guys I'm guessing too) and can cause tears and abrasions that can introduce infections.|`|SY9hPeROaa	shes not liking it  try some thing new|`|U35u1uEzaa	contary to what shes telling you shes not enjoying it anymore|`|en9uWbO6aa	your doing somthing wrong!!! i never had the problem before..|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	because she's probably not enjoying it try something different like tong and also ask her what she want you to do tell her you want to change it up some and you want to know what she like best and wants to try|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Is she getting bored?

You cannot get temporary false teeth (on top of your real teeth), so either you have to go through wearing braces, have crowns put on your teeth, or have your teeth removed to make room for a proper prosthesis. Putting crowns on healthy teeth or extracting healthy teeth is a very bad idea, so you should either learn to live with it or get braces.    Depending on how crooked your teeth are, your best option will probably be braces, but you should not expect that braces can fix the issue in a couple of months. Most people need to wear braces for over a year.    However, it is possible to have braces put on the inside of your teeth, but whether you are fit for that can only be answered by a professional after an examination.

Rn8Em3OLaa	6 cups of 'popped' popcorn is only 186 calories! 6 CUPS!  But of course if you put lots of salt and butter like the cinemas, then the calories will probably skyrocket.    As for nutrients, if you only eat popcorn you will definitely need some fiber, protein, calcium, iron and many vitamins.  Maybe eat a balanced diet (yeah, yeah... that's what everyone says, but it's true). You should just eat popcorn as something to fill you up a bit.    Milk, eggs, veggies, fruits, bread and all meats is what you REALLY need I would expect... Aren't you hungry or tired if you, 'mostly' eat popcorn.    So in conclusion, yes, popped popcorn is healthy (with nothing on it!)... but I wouldn't recommend eating it 'most' of the day, 'every' day.    Hope this might have helped. ?

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now.

I am almost the exact same, just younger. What I am going to try out is St. Johns Wort, a natural extract that may help with depression, but doesn't always work. If that doesn't work, I will probably try getting prescribed medicine, or even going to psychotherapy, however there are chances in younger folk that the medicine will cause more suicidal thoughts and such, and personally I don't think talking with someone else is going to change how I feel, because I've felt like this forever and always talked it out in my head. For people like us death seems to be a viable option, but its harder said than done, and usually will not end only your own life. I wish that something would happen to me, even though I feel like its inevitable that something will.    My advice for you now would be to try to get some sort of help, medication wise IMO. Then figure out how you REALLY want to spend the rest of your life. I mean really hard thinking about it. If you want to continue living the way you do, but not feel as down all the time, then try mentally to forget everything else in life that you could be doing, and focus mainly on what you feel like doing at that moment. I find that impulse decisions can help force yourself out and about, usually getting things you want to get done done. If you want to change, psychotherapy would be best. It will allow you to find what you need to change and should help you take steps on changing. Best of luck to you sir, you are doing better than me at least.
6Pf1WbGLaa	There are a number of remedies you can try that are just as effective ( if not more so ) than commercial drugs.    However, that type of treatment does not deal with the underlying problem. It just helps with the symptom.    My advice is to get counselling  but as you say thats expensive and youd prefer something costing less.    Perhaps an even better solution is to try and help yourself find out whats getting you down in the first place.    If you need help to do that, have a look at Panic Breaker dot com as there is loads of info there and details of how to get very inexpensive help if you need it.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	Cardiovascular technologists and technicians assist physicians in diagnosing and treating cardiac (heart) and peripheral vascular (blood vessel) ailments.    Cardiovascular technologists and technicians schedule appointments perform ultrasound or cardiovascular procedures, review doctors interpretations and patient files, and monitor patients heart rates. They also operate and care for testing equipment, explain test procedures, and compare findings to a standard to identify problems. Other day-to-day activities vary significantly between specialties.    Cardiovascular technologists may specialize in any of three areas of practice: invasive cardiology, echocardiography, or vascular technology.     Here a link to a very valuable resource that tells you all about specific jobs and more specially all about the cardiovascular technician.      Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition  http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos100.htm    If you don't know exactly what this is a quick explanation is it's a compilation of information collected by the bureau of labor statistics about different jobs.|`|LnWFVZeZaa	It depends on if you want to be a non-invasive or invasive. The non-invasive cardio tech does things like draw blood, ekg, stress testing, vital signs just the basic things. invasive assist doctors with cardiac catheterization, the also do non-invasive as well. They also go more into depth with echocardiography than non invasive techs do.Invasive cardio techs go to school longer. I think it's 2 years, where as non invasive go for about 8 to 10 months. Check your local community college or technical schools for those classes.

They say, too, that if you crack your knuckles, that you'll get arthritis. But there is no evidence showing that is true. When you're cracking something, you're popping pockets of air in those joints. If anything, I would think that you'd have a little more luck in one of those situations because your joints would be a little more conditioned to withstand a certain amount of pressure. I crack everything, but I stopped cracking my neck 'cause I was afraid that one day I would break it.

I have even encountered people who *have* completely lost the sight in one eye and not noticed, it having developed where the other eye was already strongly dominant.  That came as a serious shock to the individuals concerned.  More than once it was noticed when someone went to buy some binoculars and, for the first time in years, looked through each eye separately.    Floaters are common, but any case of sudden fresh floaters needs an examination because while 98% of such cases are harmless, 2% are giving early warning of a retinal detachment.    And to correct another point: there is no pain with a retinal detachment.  There are no pain nerves in the retina.  edit: a quick 'net search appears to confirm this, except in rare cases of secondary detachment, with an eye inflammation, infection or tumour.

oPJxVcqJaa	If you're looking to build muscle, you really need to be looking at overloading muscles (i.e. lifting as heavy a weight as you can without compromising form/posture) and doing fewer reps.

You don't need to cut out the cardio completely but most people whose goal is to build muscle mass tend to only use it for their warm ups and cool downs.

ouzrDPaSaa	I've had a stutter since childhood (Im 23 now).  My stutter is much better when Im relaxed, I find it's a vicious circle-the more aware I am of it the worse it is.  Just try to accept your speech as it is, tell yourself it doesnt really matter if you stutter on a few words anyway, its not a big deal.  If people think it is a big deal then they're not worth worrying about.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Use the WebFerret search engine, your own, and the Wikipedia, and Google websites. GROUPS, at Myspace, Yahoo, and/or Google may be of assistance, and also contact the state, and national bodies for more information. STUTTERING - STAMMERING : The word "stuttering" is mostly used in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The word "stammering" is usually preferred in the United Kingdom, Eire, India and most other Commonwealth countries. Try deliberately slowing your speech. You could try several different talking speeds: 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100% Consider your current rate of speech as being 105%, a rate at which you stutter frequently. Go back to 85%, then slowly increase, in stages, until you begin to stutter noticeably: then go back to 85%, and work your way up to the rate before you began stuttering at a rate that you find unacceptable. Keep at that rate, for a good while, maybe later, risking stepping it up one more notch; confident that you can always work your way back up from 85% again.                    Think of it in terms of modem speeds on your computer: if that speed is set too high for the connection to the ISP, there will be problems. You may well be currently "overclocking" your speech modem: the difference between your brain speed, and the rate at which you are able to speak clearly and distinctly, without stuttering markedly, is the issue. A different suggestion is putting some marbles in your mouth.  STAMMERING:  I have heard that if you start to breath out just before you begin vibrating your vocal cords to make sound, that establishes momentum that helps reduce stammering. Good luck!

J1AydXh9aa	It's a conundrum, but I have a couple of opinions on it...    1) They think if eating a lot will make you gain weight, then eating less will only make you lose weight... simple logic right?    2) While in middle school and high school, girls hear from other girls how they lost 20 lbs by starving themselves.  They then go and try this starvation method and lose 10 lbs and starts to believe the hype that you can lose weight in a very short period of time by starving yourself and with no exercise.  Then, they learn later in life that starving is bad, but when they get to a point where they start feeling fat again, they revert back to what they know in desperation to lose weight FAST regardless if it's the right way or not.     I've drilled my gf the right way to lose "fat" and even trained her for 2 months where she lost 15 lbs.

These arrhythmias are a common event for those with ToF and often occur as the right side of your heart enlarges due to leakage of the pulmonary and/or tricuspid valves.  You should definitely make an appointment with your cardiologist and get the problems diagnosed by a professional.  It may be that you need another surgery to repair or replace one or more of your valves, or the arrhythmia can often be stopped with a catheter ablation procedure.

And I have experienced suicide in my life before i'm told I don't know what i am talking about-both from having these feelings myself (and realising how selfish i was being) but also because my best friend committed suicide when she was just 18.    If you are having true suicidal feelings then you need to see a doctor. Either someone who can prescribe something that works in the long term (and not just the 'quick fix' that xanax appears to be giving you...Which, by the way, sounds very much like an addictive reaction to medication...) or someone you can talk to.

There are more than 4,000 deaths due to asthma each year, many of which are avoidable with proper treatment and care. In addition, asthma is indicated as contributing factor for nearly 7,000 other deaths each year. [14]      * Since 1980 asthma death rates overall have increased more than 50% among all genders, age groups and ethnic groups. The death rate for children under 19 years old has increased by nearly 80% percent since 1980. [15]      * More females die of asthma than males, and women account for nearly 65% of asthma deaths overall. [16]      * African Americans are three times more likely to die from asthma.  African American Women have the highest asthma mortality rate of all groups, more than 2.5 times higher than Caucasian women.

Pl. find here the details.   The breasts of a female primates body contain the mammary glands, which secrete milk used to feed infants.    Male breasts and female breasts in human beings develop from the same embryological tissues. In females at puberty sex hormones, mainly estrogens, promote breast development. In males this does not happen. As a result, breasts become more prominent in adult females than in males.    Breast schematic diagram (adult female human cross section) - Legend: 1. Chest wall 2. Pectoralis muscles 3. Lobules 4. Nipple 5. Areola 6. Duct 7. Fatty tissue 8. SkinThe breasts are modified sudoriferous (sweat) glands, producing milk in women, and in some rare cases, men.[2] Each breast has one nipple surrounded by the areola. The areola is colored from pink to dark brown and has several sebaceous glands. In women, the larger mammary glands within the breast produce the milk. They are distributed throughout the breast, with two-thirds of the tissue found within 30 mm of the base of the nipple.[3] These are drained to the nipple by between 4 and 18 lactiferous ducts, where each duct has its own opening. The network formed by these ducts is complex, like the tangled roots of a tree. It is not always arranged radially, and branches close to the nipple. The ducts near the nipple do not act as milk reservoirs; Ramsay et al. have shown that conventionally described lactiferous sinuses do not, in fact, exist. Instead, most milk is actually in the back of the breast, and when suckling occurs, the smooth muscles of the gland push more milk forward.    The remainder of the breast is composed of connective tissue (collagen and elastin), adipose tissue (fat), and Cooper's ligaments. The ratio of glands to adipose tissues rises from 1:1 in nonlactating women to 2:1 in lactating women.[3]    The breasts sit over the pectoralis major muscle and usually extend from the level of the 2nd rib to the level of the 6th rib anteriorly. The superior lateral quadrant of the breast extends diagonally upwards towards the axillae and is known as the tail of Spence. A thin layer of mammary tissue extends from the clavicle above to the seventh or eighth ribs below and from the midline to the edge of the latissimus dorsi posteriorly. (For further explanation, see anatomical terms of location.)    The arterial blood supply to the breasts is derived from the internal thoracic artery (formerly called the internal mammary artery), lateral thoracic artery, thoracoacromial artery, and posterior intercostal arteries. The venous drainage of the breast is mainly to the axillary vein, but there is some drainage to the internal thoracic vein and the intercostal veins. Both sexes have a large concentration of blood vessels and nerves in their nipples. The nipples of both women and men can become erect in response to sexual stimuli,[4] and also to cold.    The breast is innervated by the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the fourth through sixth intercostal nerves. The nipple is supplied by the T4 dermatome.      Lymphatic drainage  About 75% of lymph from the breast travels to the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. The rest travels to parasternal nodes, to the other breast, or abdominal lymph nodes. The axillary nodes include the pectoral, subscapular, and humeral groups of lymph nodes. These drain to the central axillary lymph nodes, then to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is particularly relevant to oncology, since breast cancer is a common cancer and cancer cells can break away from a tumour and spread to other parts of the body through the lymph system by metastasis.      Shape and support  Breasts vary in both size and shape, and their external appearance is not predictive of their internal anatomy or lactation potential. The shape of a woman's breasts is in large part dependent on their support, which primarily comes from the Cooper's ligaments, and the underlying chest on which they rest. The breast is attached at its base to the chest wall by the deep fascia over the pectoral muscles. On its upper surface it is given some support by the covering skin where it continues on to the upper chest wall. It is this support which determines the shape of the breasts. In a small fraction of women, the frontal ducts (ampullae) in the breasts are not flush with the surrounding breast tissue, which causes the sinus area to visibly bulge outward.       Relatively round breasts which protrude almost horizontally.In discussing the support of breasts, it is helpful to draw a distinction between breasts which rest on the chest below, and those which do not. High, rounded breasts protrude almost horizontally from the chest wall. All breasts are like this in early stages of development, and such a shape is common in younger women and girls. This protruding or high breast is anchored to the chest at its base, and the weight is distributed evenly over the area|`|4ZEpgMDXaa	Huh???????|`|JQMajdtvaa	umm.  are you f!u!c!k!i!n!g! kidding me?|`|Nzc7t6KEaa	urm  the big ol' melons on your chest.|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	Hahahahaahahah  rolling now hahhaahahahahah  rolling and farting hahahahahahah  rolling and puking hahahahahah  rolling and crying hahaahahahahah    omg visual.

BT5otMrxaa	I don't think there are any mental effects in not having sex till your 30. A lot of religious people wait to have sex till they are married.  They don't have any mental disorders because of lack of sex. They fill there time up with friends and work and activities just like normal people.  People who are sexual, that are in between sexual relationships can go through years with out sex. Also "some" people in prison can go without sex and they don't go crazy.|`|dtq32xuwaa	yes. proven to increase nerds|`|Y8TS6Do0aa	No. Not having sex doesn't affect your mental or physical health in any way.    However, the reason someone isn't having sex 'til they're 30 (which is highly unusual) could be any one of a laundry list of phobias, neurotic tendencies, or psychotic tendencies. Or they could be completely normal and just never had sex.    There may be a mental effect in having sex after such a long wait, though. Sex is a big step in human development.|`|SYGGh9Jdaa	I'm 19 and I haven't had sex yet, from my experience I guess I have Inferiority complex

Headaches can be caused by many things, inc. dehydration, high blood pressure, pinched nerves, stress, etc.  There is quite a list.  I am not trying to scare you, many reasons are simple.|`|aozlk1Alaa	Needing Glasses could be the reason forcing his vision, or just maybe he is experiencing stress.|`|SOW2ZwkKaa	well i sleep pretty well myself and about 5 months back i started having crazy headaches too.  i had never gotten them before so thats why i freaked out.  oftentimes i would be driving down the road and my head/eyes would hurt so bad i would psyche myself into thinking i was about to have a seizure or some junk.  it was crazy.  so i finally went to the eye doctor and after an exam he told me i needed glasses.  something about my vision being slightly impaired, but enough to cause the headaches.  ive worn them for about 2 months now with zero headaches.

Now good interventions are available and there is no fear.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	ask his Dr. This is not a clinic or a hospital.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I don't recommend a chiropractor I recommend a orthopedic surgeon, give credit where credit is due. Going to someone with a few years of training in muscles is far from a serious condition that may take months and have serious side effects.        He'll need X-Rays or MRI's and then maybe surgery.|`|AA12359017	Yes, in some cases there is another way to deal with it.    He should have x-rays and see a Chiropractor.  They can really help so much with getting the problem.    I know as I have had the same problem and a Chiropractor was the only way that I was able to get any relieve.    Good luck to him.
3p7552z3aa	Hate to break it to you, but height is largely genetic.    Even if your parents are both tall, you can end up short due to the genetical variation. And assuming you did not suffer from malnutrients as a child.    at 20 years gold your epithlial growth plate (excuse my spelling) has already closed off. They are the cartilage on the end of your bones in which is allowed to grow. Once they are closed and parts of your body fuses, you stop growing in height.    Some are late bloomers... so you may have a small chance of growing. if you go to the doctors they can verify if your growth plates have closed or not.

AA11693263	You might to find some solace in the fact that everything you mentioned is treatable. I have a Neurological Disease that causes me to have nerve pain from head to toe 24/7. I find that I can stay emotionally okay with what I have with the understanding that it could be much, much worse. What I have isn't fatal...I am very thankful for that, I am not in a wheelchair, I am not stuck in a hospital, there are so many things to be thankful for that I don't have it kind of makes me okay with what I do have and believe, what I have isn't a walk in the park. My little 3 year old niece is in the hospital right now. She has a blood infection (actually acid in her bloodstream) from the Chemo she gets for the tumors in her brain. The doctors just found another one on her brain stem. She has a fever of almost 105 degrees and is losing her hair. The most amazing thing about the whole awful situation? Every time you look at her, no matter how awful she is feeling, no matter how many needles just got poked into her, no matter how sick the chemo has made her feel, this precious baby always has the biggest, brightest smile on her face. I figure if she can go through all of this with a smile who the hey am I to complain about some nerve pain? I know you are in pain sweetie. I know it sucks. I know you just want to feel better already. I told you these stories not to make you feel bad or sad but to explain to you that no matter how much physical pain you are having that you can't control, you have complete control over how you react to it. I know it's hard to keep a positive outlook all the time, and that's okay. Give yourself some time every once in a while to feel bad about feeling bad but then pick yourself back up and start being thankful for all the things that are not wrong with you and all of the blessings you do have. I have gotten so depressed at times that I actually couldn't find anything to be thankful for. Then I just looked around my house and the thing that got me through that day? The fact of how I realized that I have running water and am really thankful that I don't have to haul buckets to a stream or creek and lug my own water into the house. It really helps me to find thanks for the smallest things. I could go on and on. It is 6 a.m. where I am right now, I have slept maybe 3 hours all night long. Instead of being upset that I am going to have yet another exhausting day, I am glad that I have electricity, DSL, and a computer to get on to help the night pass by a little less lonely because I can't wake up my kids to come hang out with me all night, lol and my hubby is gone all night working. So, like I said, try taking your mind off of your pain by remembering what your pleasures are. I hope you feel better soon :)|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I'm not going to laugh, I am handicapped and live in pain. I know what pain is. I feel sorry for you. You have to take each problem one issue at a time and address it until it's better, the one that's bothering you the most. Good luck and stay well.
74c8b30f822cbd858ebede507e67269caa	If I understand your question correctly let me help by explaining what happened with me. The colposcopy is just a scope to view. They will biopsy when what they see is suspicious. Then the biopsy takes cells to review. They can tell if just from the biopsy if it is cancer and then how advanced. Sometimes just the biopsy removes most of it. If it is cancer, you need to know now, so it can be treated successfully. I had my cervix frozen to remove suspicious cells back in 1987 and I have been fine since. The wound from the biopsy is usually cauterized. The abnormal cells do not enter through wounds they can grow in the cells.|`|KuXNYqa3aa	doctor(ie gets paid to treat people)  if your really worried i suggest a second opinion.  doesnt want to hurt or unnecisarily scar people(its bad 4 business :)|`|XEKvJzGaaa	A biopsy is standard procedure if a doctor thinks that you may have cancer. The doctor works in a sterile field and each tiny wound is sealed as soon as soon as he is finished with it. Do it for your health. I know you don't want to die from cancer. I had a biopsy internally and it showed I had cancer. We got rid of it completely by removing the affected organ. What a great day that was. Do it for yourself.

LzeB46RLaa	I can only answer to your 1st part of question - anti-glare.  I am working on Computer.  I have the glass with anti-glare.  Anti-glare means there is a one type of coating given on outside of the glasses.  It is like the sun-glasses used to protect from the sun rays on motor car window glasses.  By this coating, you remains protected from the glare or light which comes out from the computer monitor every time while you are working on the computer.  It definitely protects our eyes from the rays the lessens the strains on our eyes nerves.  While we are outside in the afternoon, this glass is also being useful to protect our eyes from the hard sun rays.  I feel this much is enough to fulfil your query of your 1st part of the question.|`|fe6c2a643018e511f256e18a75d7a8e4aa	anti-glare is usually known as anti-reflective coating.  Anti reflective coating works by allowing the light to pass through the lens instead of just reflecting on your lenses.  It allows more light into your eyes and takes away the glare on your lenses.    It kinda sounds like you might have a light sensitivity issue which anti-reflective probably isn't the best for you since it allows more light in.  You should talk to your doctor about it.    It's not possible to tell if you have astigmatism with the little info you gave.  IF there's astigmatism on your prescription, it would be written down on the CYL part of the Rx with an axis number.

1kfKiw1Jaa	Well, I am a gay guy but I had the same problem during my first time having sex.  His touches and licking (he loves to lick!) on my body was excruciatingly ticklish!  I thought it was just nervousness about being my first time...  But if it's happening to you after 3 years with the same partner I doubt it has anything to do with nervousness.  You say this is a recent development?  You weren't always this ticklish?      The advice I've gotten was to have him try using a firmer touch using more of the surface of his hands (palms vs fingertips) and to try starting with a nice, firm, relaxing massage.  A couple drinks beforehand might make you more relaxed too.  Keeping the room nice and warm might help too.

AA11815233	Eat your vegetables. Fiber and antioxidants protect against cancer.|`|jIfLqlUxaa	Diet, exercise and drink plenty of water! Take doctor recommended vitamins and always maintain a decent exersise routine.|`|3765a890ec73a001872517a48b355f97aa	1) IMPROVE YOUR DIET:- A study of 500,000 people performed by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) in 2005 suggested that a high intake of red meat could increase your risk of developing colon cancer. The study also suggested that not getting enough fibre could increase your chances of developing this type of cancer. Finally, the study linked regular consumption of fish with a reduced bowel cancer risk.    Therefore, if your diet lacks fibre or fish or you find yourself eating red meat regularly perhaps now is the time to change. If you eat red meat every day try to cut down and eat it just two or three times per week. If fish is not currently part of your diet then try and have a fish dish at least once a week. If you are currently only getting low amounts of fibre try and eat some fruits and vegetables every day. You don't have to make any drastic changes to your diet but the small adjustments suggested above could really make the difference where colorectal cancer is involved.    2) DO MORE EXERCISE:- Exercise stimulates a process called peristalsis in the colon. This is a muscular contraction which forces waste through the colon and into the rectum. By exercising more regularly you can ensure that waste moves through your body more quickly and therefore reduce the risk of any waste sitting in the colon and leaching back into your body's tissues. Regular exercise is also believed to increase the survival rate of post treatment bowel cancer patients by as much as 50%. In a study by Meyerhart et al [1], 573 women with colorectal cancer between stages 1 and 3 were observed for the six months following their treatment. The results showed that the women who increased the amount of exercise they did following their colon cancer diagnosis were around 50% more likely to survive.    Therefore, if you do not currently lead a very active lifestyle try and do something about this. The changes you make do not have to be drastic. In fact many experts suggest that small increases in the amount of physical activity you perform each day can do the trick. If you are not a fan of the gym there are many other options available to you. Try going for a brisk walk on your lunch break, taking the stairs at work or walking to the shops instead of taking the car. All these simple changes can build up to significantly reduce your chances of being affected by colorectal cancer.    3) STOP SMOKING:- Most people know that smoking is directly linked to lung cancer. However, a lot of people are unaware that smoking can also cause other cancers including colon cancer. The reason for this is that cigarettes contain carcinogens (substances which increase your risk of developing cancer) and once inhaled they can reach all areas of the body including the colon. On top of this smoking is believed to increase the size of polyps making them more likely to become cancerous.    If you do smoke then you really should consider quitting. Not only does it increase your risk for multiple types of cancer but it can also damage all your major organs,cause your skin to become wrinkled, turn your teeth yellow and much more. On top of this smoking can also have a negative impact on those around you via the smoke you exhale. Quitting is not going to be easy but if you want to reduce your overall bowel cancer risk and significantly improve your health you should give it a try.
e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	Well, you DO have breasts, no matter how small they are ;o)    Of they may grow "youth growth" until about 21-22.    Or maybe not.    Then I know from my wife and have heard at least one other in the very smallest breast division, that they retain some more size after nursing (wereas bigger breasts often lose volume after that).    And then of course a little if you gain weight generally.    But hopefully you are not too worried about it, are you? There is no need to - your breasts are absolutely real breasts, complete with everything.... even if they are "just about two nipples". I have always been nuts about my wife's and found them extra fascinating - sort of an extra magic that there are almost not there - and yet so much there ;o)    So don't worry that someone you want to be sweet to would be disappointed. I don't believe they will - it will just be an extra charm of yours. But I know the girl herself can have that worry - at 16, she wouldn't let me close ;o) I haven't asked her - but I think it was because of that (the micro size).     But it worked out extra fine in the end, and I guarantee you your breasts can feel just as wonderful as any others - maybe even a little more, because you had that little insecurity about it. Then they relief is always a bit sweeter - just like the water tastes better when you are more thirsty. So please don't run away from guys because of it - any more than you have to... of course, a girl is always entitled to play a little hide and seek, but you know what I mean ;o)|`|cnMk2jWAaa	Don't panic about it, they aren't that great anyway.

5v6ovESbaa	Fish is good if you're trying to lose weight because its low in fat as well as carbs. But I would be carefull of how its cooked. Frying and battering are high in fat. Some of the pre-marinated fish you buy in the supermarket is also full of oils and fat too.    Poaching, grilling and steaming are very low in fat but can be a bit bland. One of my favorite ways is to grill the fish with a thin layer of honey mustard. It gives it a bit of flavor while keeping the calories low.|`|KppM3VzAaa	Fish is good as it has healthy fats and high protien.  Try and at dark fleshed  fish too.    You need to be eating 4 - 6 meals per day (little and often) with high quantities of protein and balance in nutrition, carbs minerals and vitamins etc.    Steaming is the best way to cook as it will keep 95% of nutritional value, microwaving will lose 95%, boiling 50%.    You can have it with brown pasta, peppers and sauce one time, on coos coos the next, loads of variations having completely different tastes.    Hope that helps, email me if you need more info

It was necessary for our evolution because for a long time we were hunter gatherers. We were either running away from danger or running after game, or looking for fruits to gather. Those that did not have these natural pain killers died off by natural selection.
oc90ru3waa	I also experience from panic attacks, and the best advice i can give you is breathing, really focus on your breathing and keep it calm and steady. Practice breathing techniques. Note to yourself that a panic attack will pass, usually in just a few minutes. Regular exercise also helps me, taking a walk, or just doing something to keep my mind off my anxious feelings. Think positively. If it starts getting really bad and interfearing with your life, try talking with a doctor about getting on some type of anti-anxiety medications. I;ve put a link to some breathing techniques that could help..Good luck to you.|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively).     The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the http://1-800-therapist.com/ & http://www.metanoia.org/choose/ websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.    Practice one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm-too-fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.

If not how long and how often is it happening? 5 min long, or hours or days?   I am thinking you should go to a hospital and be seen. They will give you the proper medication, which is a good antidepressant which is also used for anxiety/panic attacks. Also they will give you a mild type of valium which will help your symptoms right now, and make you feel calmer. Please trust me and do this.

As soon as I finished high school I went to one of those places where they allow you to use their computers and etc it seemed mostly to be an absolute waste of time to me and so I left there and started looking out more on my own and it wasn't too long after that I did get a job and I have been there since April last yeae. What you need to do is get out there and look for the job and ask places if they have any vancancies and if not then leave them your resume and make sure to attend all interviews when you're notified of any, let them know that you are determined and that you want the job.  No one else can do anything for you, it is up to you to do it yourself but remember to take a break every now and then and don't worry yourself over it too much.

Believe Jesus is God and receive Jesus as your savior.  Commit to and follow Jesus.    If you do not believe me, ask God to reveal Himself to you tonight in your dream and ask Him if He is Jesus; or ask God to speak to you and ask Him if He is Jesus.

70deb155c3a74021c8e6025bd23e64fdaa	An easy trick to use that really works is this.  Chew each mouth fullof food at least twenty times.  While you are eating, sit at the table without television or radios or any other distractions; concentrate only on eating.  Most of why people overeat is because they are occupied by something else and not listening to their body for cues that they are full.  Finally, stop eating when you are full and don't put the plate in the fridge for nibbling later.  If you can afford it, scrape the remainder into the garbage, if that's not an option for you, then put the leftovers in a covered dish.  Try this for a month and you will be astounded at the success.|`|500d6fc36eb98b82443dc02f01ab5214aa	Less TV means less snacks, and cut back for example, one egg instead of two, go for more walks or hikes.

To be shaping up and slimming down you need to reduce your body fat and tone your muscle. Going to the gym and eating correctly will do this.    Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day and do exercise too.     You need to be having simple carbs (fruit smoothie, banana etc) before going to the gym to kick start the fat burning process, then a protein shake within 30 mins after finishing|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	I agree with cutting out the processed junk. It is not food. I do everything within my power to avoid anything with enriched flour (fancy wording for white), corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenated oils, hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, artificial flavors, etc. I also obviously avoid animal and animal products, not only for animal cruelty and to help eliminate some of the rape against the environment they cause, but I also think they aren't healthy.     This is not a "diet" for me, but my life. It's a big part of who I am. It's not always easy to avoid that stuff, and sometimes I don't. I indulged in cake this weekend at my grandfather's 100th birthday celebrations. I even gave some to my daughter, who is only 16 months old. Of course she liked it, but it's not a daily or weekly thing for her, and she probably won't get anything like that again until her birthday in September, unless I start baking. (Cookies and cakes with real ingredients, including whole wheat flour, of course.)    It's my unscientific observation that most people I know who eat the processed junk on a regular basis (several times a day) are not thin and do have health problems. Coincidence? Maybe. But I'm doing this to help take care of myself, my daughter, my family, and the earth and its inhabitants as a whole.    ETA: I do snack. Sometimes I do wander to the fridge looking for something to nibble on. However, almost everything we have in the kitchen and in the house are whole, real foods. So I grab a banana, or a slice of whole wheat bread or blanche some frozen veggies. No biggie. Occasionally, I will go for something "junky" like the all-natural fruit and grain bars and granola bars we buy from Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. (TJ's is great. They sell real food for cheap.)     Also, I'm not worried about calories, or carbs or any of that silly stuff. I just eat what I want when I want it (even if it's after seven or even ten in the evening). Yet, everything I eat is whole and real.|`|7Z3hWNewaa	For dieting, I recommend cutting out sugars in the form of candy and soda (pop), as well as limiting starches and processed wheat (white breads, white rice, etc...). Eat more protein, such as dairy products, nuts, meat, fish and poultry while taking a fiber supplement or eating food high in fiber.    Eat fresh fruits and never eat canned fruits as they are canned in a very sugary syrup.    Don't go on an "all vegetable" diet because they're unhealthy. Eat a good balance of meat, vegetables and whole grain breads with every meal. For a while you may want to cut out breads from your meals entirely. It's up to you.    This all helps in losing some weight.    As with any diet it will be more effective if you exercise regularly as well. Walking, swimming or jogging are often helpful if you're not interested in strenuous workouts. Otherwise, try yoga or palates.
qIcWac3Yaa	Hi,    To me, it sounds like your dad was verbally abusive throughout your childhood.  If so, it's no wonder you don't like to witness yelling -- any kind of yelling would remind you of being verbally abused.    Also, it's interesting that you describe yourself as a sensitive person.  Often what happens in a verbally abusive situation is that the abusive person will yell at you, and then tell you that you are too sensitive if you protest.  If this happened in your childhood, you would have started to believe that you really are too sensitive.    I would recommend reading the following book:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Verbally-Abusive...|`|yeYL8Udoaa	ummm just cover your ears?|`|AA10579309	You have gotten into the habit of internalizing it when others express anger.  Learn to externalize it -- attribute the anger to the person who is yelling.  Learn to roll your eyes and go, "There he goes again, being a drama queen as usual."      It's even more effective if you have a third party who can complain with you.  "Oh my God, did you hear the way he was going on in there?  I swear, he thinks the world revolves around him."  And the other person can say something like, "I know!  That's why he has no friends."  Then laugh a good, hearty, vindictive laugh.    Whatever problem anyone has, there is a way to handle it like a calm, rational adult.  So there is no excuse for yelling.  And you can actually say that: "Look, I'm sure you have a problem, but there is no excuse for yelling."      (God, I am so sick of these types of people thinking that yelling gets things done.)    As for TV and movies, I just hope that as you deal with people in real life, your anxiety will decrease and you'll have the emotional calluses to handle fictional yelling.|`|MGDtjCK1aa	try mild exposure to it. and little by little you will develop tolerance to it.|`|tACJnpI1aa	You can say "Hey, I'm an adult that is in love with twilight, I deserve to be yelled at." And then  you'll feel much better.    Seriously, yelling is not the worst thing in the world. Do you know how to effectively learn to cope? Through systematic structured exposure. If it's rooted in what your father did when he was drunk (boo f*cking hoo) then you have to face the yelling throught the hierarchy of fear instilling scenarious. That is expose to what bothers you the least first, then move up to what really bothers you. i.e. Imagining yelling all the way to being yelled at.

If you aren't losing the weight with that heavy load of cardio every week, you aren't meant to lose it.|`|1asStWo4aa	I don't know if anyone would actually be able to tell you how, considering that everyone is different, even a person with exactly your measurements and who is exactly your age, and worked out just as much as you, wouldn't be able to tell you how to lose five pounds.     What works for them, won't necessarily work for you. My advice to you is, if you're really deadset on losing weight, just try out a bunch of different things until something works. Other than that-even though you said don't-I have to say, that at 5.5, 108 is I think a bit underweight. I'm 5.71/2 and I can only weigh 125 before I'm unhealthy. Statistically speaking, you shouldn't be able to weigh much less than me before you're considered the same.    I would also like to strongly advise against not eating, if you're the type to do that. It get's addicting fast, and while it makes you lose a ton of weight, it also causes irreversable damage to your organs, and severe malnutrition that can last for months after you've started eating again.

HajCweLWaa	Hi-- I went on a raw food diet 9 years ago after I got a breast cancer diagnosis, turning down chemo, radiation, surgery, etc. I cured my breast cancer, fibromyalgia , arthritis and a long list of ailments. I think you would definitely benefit because the liver may be at the root of the cause for your keratosis pilaris or at least diet-related-- a nutritional deficiency etc. I eat 100% raw -- yes for 9 years! and I'm still in perfect health today!  You could start increasing raw foods  gradually and you may notice the benefits long before you reach 75% raw.I feel fantastic all the time with loads of energy and clear skin.Are you sure your keratosis pilaris isn't dermatitis herpetiformis?  from gluiten?  Just a thought. Nurse Kindheart
831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Do not try any of the "over the counter" crap or stuff from your friends, some of these things are mind controlling and you don't know what may happen. See your doctor and ask him. If you had Bi Polar, you'd know, believe me.

I would not have answered this otherwise but I saw that you mentioned bi-polar disorder, which my brother suffers.    In bi-polar disorder the brain releases chemicals which bounce your emotions between the 2 poles, manic, and depressive = happy and sad.    This case is very rare, but if it is something that you research more about, you will want to seek professional help, as Y!A will not be able to produce the chemical that your brain needs :p|`|h2bGyi8Uaa	ask your doctor...|`|1thElV58aa	Your problem is loneliness not depression or bi-polar disorder.|`|DytfqrkSaa	Funny thing about Anti-depressants..they will make you feel better, but your crash will lead you to kill yourself. I've seen it personally, and it sucks when it happens. (R.I.P. Chris.)     The best thing to do is just talk to people, that's what most psychiatrists do, is just have you talk things out, and make things realize things for yourself.     Those types of Meds are NOT the answers, talking to close firends or family members are.    Good Luck!   Ryan|`|3OeE8kMQaa	You should not begin to self medicate yourself, it's a dangerous road. Learn the triggers and combat them with better thoughts or behavior.

If you are over 18 you are much more likely to get a prescription.   And talk to a friend about it, If you have a spouse or are dating someone then talk to them about it, they may be able to help you out.bi-polar and manic depressive disorders are very extreme and are not mild disorders by any means.  If you do truly believe you have them you need to see a psychiatrist not for long sessions but enough to get meds....    chances are you are just feeling the pressures of life but seeing as I am not a doctor I can't make a professional oppinion. Message me if you'd like I don't mind giving more info.|`|0Z2aBH0Daa	My advice -- whatever you try, whether prescription or over the counter, I would try half the portion for a week before increasing it...also I tried St John's Wort for my hormonal moodiness (2 people I know take it daily and it has changed their lives) and had a SEVERE allergic reaction, my skin ballooned up with raised bumps all over, my eyelids and ears were swollen, I had to take Prednisone, it was terrifying. Then I found out SJW can CAUSE extreme sensitivity to sunlight and other issues so it is very very strong.  But remember, many people swear by it.    Also it is true that anti-depressants can cause suicidal thoughts. My brother committed suicide 1.5 weeks after he started Prozac. He was having hallucinations and not eating due to too much for his body.    I highly recommend that you try Royal Maca in either capsule, tablet or tea form. It's all natural and regulates your hormones. They have it for both men and women. My friend got pregnant with it after 2 months as recommended by her doctor, she was going thru fertility tx too, and another friend just got pregnant with it after just 2 months as well! after not being able to get pregnant for over a year. But it's not just good for fertility -- it's great for regulating mood swings, I am going to try it myself. They sell it online, at health food stores, and at Whole Foods. It doesn't have side effects either as far as I know. Research it!|`|Lz10HGPhaa	I dont think anti-depressants are the best answer as I have only heard bad thing about them, and they just make you feel weird: Dizzy, nauseos and things that make want to stay home and not get out which will contribute to your depression.  And also what would happen when you stop taking them?  I think the best thing you can do is make changes in your life like:  Talk to your family more, volunteer at an animal shelter, exsersice, get a good partner, Get close to God.What has helped me the most is getting dogs, they always keep a smile in my face and I take them out to the dog park where I meet really cool people and I take them for walk, bathe them and they do all kids of crazy thing that just makes you smile and happy. And  the good thing about this is that the results will be permanent, You should absolutly try to talk to a therapist, who says they have to have a Diploma from a fancy school?  I think be best therapists are your Grandma, mom, dad, grandpa, neighboor, they actually have real life experience and they can give you the bests advices and help, but talking to someone about it its a most, dont bottle up your feeling, that would be very very bad!!!      Good luck      Good Luck!
HxlRHy3Daa	there is no miracle way to just shed weight it DOES take time you have to really push yourself. an eg im fairly fit but if im jogging il want to give up after 5 mins when i know my body is capable of 20 minutes  just avoid all the shite foods like crisps etc.   simple substitutes like orange instead of coke, brown bread instead of white bread, raspberries instead of jellies  3months is more then enough to get into good shape. but it requires a PROPER workout of at least 20 mins which can be done anywhere the trick is that when your feeling that burn to push yourself even more|`|Uk9dMYg7aa	Stop eating so much.    You can't expect someone to just come on here with a miracle cure to weight loss. It takes time and dedication if you're going to do it properly. Go to the gym 3 times a week for about an hour session at least each. You'll notice after doing proper excersize youll already feel better about yourself and also you'll lose the want to snack on unhealthy things- you just lose your appetite for things like that!|`|QIU50OCIaa	Do a lot of cardio (jog in place, ride a bike, jump rope), and start eating healthy.

However if you want crash methods, here are the following (i strongly discourage these):    1. crash diet. Eat/drink only liquids.   2. A healthier crash diet : only fruits, veggie, and liquids  3. Don't eat... (you'll gain weight at first, but you'll lose it later. This is because your body will put you into "starvation mode" and start to save fat.)  4. Throw up (Belimia .. bad idea... you'll have rotting teeths in the long run)  5. laxative.

For many who have successfully lost weight will tell you that not only its is important to watch what you eat, but the weight loss effort will be half a success if you do not include a regular or routine exercise programme.

AA12094637	oooh thats hard i got mine and unfortunatly everyone is different but what helped me was hot showers and laying on my side not the side of the root cananl but the oppasite and putting a pillow on my head to keep it warm maybe even a heating pad on a low temp.  I also did a  lot of relaxation breathing and tried as hard as it was to keep my mind off of the pain.  However keep in mind most of us are not doctors or dentists and cant give you the advice they would give.  One thing i will say is when you do go back to the dentist make sure you tell them that the tylenol|`|AA11928403	Hey I am so sorry for your headache  I have toothaches time to time and have had two root canals.  If the Tylenol 3 is not working which is a narcotic and should be very strong, try not take more than doctor prescribe.  Instead  try putting rubbing alcohol on cotton balls and soak the affected tooth with it.  I think it will help some till you go see your dentist.  But don't swallow the alcohol and avoid contact in your mouth membrane with it because it's will irritate or break some skin inside.   Put some thick fabric around the teeth and only touch the tooth.  I just use this for my emergency aid.  Usually, antibiotics and pain pills would take care of your pain after the root canal.  But anyway, you will see your dentist shortly and hope your pain subside.|`|3I3bdjAsaa	A shot of Jack Daniels works wonders but make sure that you get someone else to drive you to the dentist. You have my sympathy. Tooth pain is worse than labor pain sometimes.
TORBP6QIaa	OK...eating as little as 450 cals perday will make you lose weight for a very short period of time...but very quickly your body will go into starvation-mode and store every ounce of fat it gets and your metabolism will just about stop and you will not lose any more weight and then when you begin to eat again your body will still be storing the fat and you will get fatter really quickly.    Sorry...I know it sounds tempting to do but it just does not work ...and I am sure you have seen pictures of anorexics and dont want to look like that either as thats a very scary and dangerous way to go.    Just do the normal healthy weight loss way and stick to it...be really strict about healthy snacks and drink water and you really will lose weight if you need to and dont forget to exercise.    If you really need to drop a few pounds for an event in a weeks time then be totally strict and eat 1200-1500 cals per day and exercise...any less than that and you risk startvation-mode setting in.|`|I2GnFoTLaa	you would die a very slow and painful death. the whole time feeling like a sick anorexic.|`|CclZtstJaa	All of it because you will die.|`|uHzBl17maa	psh from experience not very much at all!!

On average a day, I'd smoke a joint in the morning and then maybe about 2-3 hours later I'd have another one and that would go on all day, everyday.  So in a day I'd probably have about maybe 6 or 7 the most.  I'd share with everyone and smoke maybe 2-3 to myself and then the rest was shared.  It was out of pure boredom, but I had a job back then working in a cafe full time and I did graveyard shift sometimes.  So I didn't really get to have fun cos I was always working.

Vmz4woqgaa	Aspartame metabolizes in the human body to methyl alcohol.  That was the little brown bottle in Chemistry Lab that was kept locked, and the words "cannot be made non-poisonous" were beneath the little skull and crossbones on the label.  Same thing as Sterno fuel.  Don't ever ingest Aspartame, Equal, NutraSweet or anything with Phenylalanine or a warning for Phenylketonurics on the label!  All names for the same thing.  Gave me headaches and kidney aches.  Destroys brain cells.  Accused of causing fibromyalgia among many other complaints.    Haven't read any studies on Sucralose, but it is an altered chemical, and according to Dr. Schwarzbein, anything that is not natural, or gets chemically altered should be avoided.      Try Xylitol and Stevia.  "Dr. S" recommends them.  Both natural, plant based, not chemically altered, won't affect your blood sugar levels, and taste great.  I use Xylosweet brand Xylitol and Xlear brand Spry Gum and Mints.  I use NOW brand Stevia powder for sweetening real lemonade, regular tea, and peppermint and other herbal teas.    Read Dr. Diana Schwarzbein's book Schwarzbein Principle.  She is an Endocrinologist who is reversing type II diabetes through diet alone.  You don't have to buy any of her products, you can do the program with regular items from the grocery store.  You will feel so much better within 3 weeks it will be amazing.    The same diet recommendations work for diabetics and for those with low blood sugar (or hypoglycemics).    God Bless|`|BhFeii5Xaa	a lot of people have the same problem so they have avoided any of that stuff for years. The sugar alcohols like sorbitol give gastric upsets and cramps like crazy.

It can be cooked too and stays sweet!    http://www.stevia.com  for more answers on this stuff.|`|g645WO3Paa	It's only pure real sugar for me too.  I'm not sure about the exact chemical, but   I get a sick feeling when I have any substitues.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	No, your not the only one, I have to limit my aspartame and now watch forsucralose too since I became aware of it.  There are dangers of having too much of it I've read online.|`|z98Pedpwaa	Nope, you're not the only one.  I've been a type 1 for almost 25 years.  All the "loses" bother me.  Aspartame gives me a head ache too.  I can't even deal with Splenda... it drives my blood sugar nuts, but every one keeps telling me its supposed to be safe for diabetics.    That stevia stuff is great though.
4yzxXO1haa	Many anti-depressents can cause suicidal feelings, especially in teenagers, but they also can really work, which is why they're so popular. Medication needs to be tailored to the individual, which is why you need a doctor to prescribe it, then moniter the affects on you, and possibly get you to switch types and dosages.|`|mGQOgjeYaa	my friend is on zoloft and is suicidal now.|`|Cl2is5hYaa	Different people react differently to different medications, which is why there are so many different types of anti-depressants.|`|Ps2tufsoaa	They do different things to different people.  My girlfriend was put on anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication, and she almost killed herself as a result.  She said it just made her feel numb to the world, which is just as depressing as any painful feelings, so she stopped taking them and got better.  Some people do seem to improve, but some people seem to get worse.  Human emotions are very complex, and in my opinion, anti-depressant drugs are a blunt instrument for molding them, like doing surgery with a hatchet.  Sometimes it might work, but it can easily mess things up more.  In my experience, psychiatrists are very eager to put depressed people on medication, because it's easier than figuring out why the people are depressed and fixing the cause.|`|pQ10zbcDaa	You would be totally dependent to it, at first of course there will be changes but as you begin to rely on it for remedy then you would be in the worst position better if you had not take the pills in the first place...friends and other worthy activities and families can lighten up the load....|`|MbCbhvloaa	[I KNOW I'M GONNA GET A LOT OF THUMBS DOWN ]BUT I SEE NO REASON TO USE THEM ......I WAS ON PROZAC  BUT DUMPED THEM DOWN THE TOILET BECAUSE THEY MADE ME FEEL WORSE ....THAT I STARTED CUTTING MYSELF......ANY WAYS THEY ARE DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY.....

I'm starting out first probably using St. Johns Wort Extract to see if it at least helps.    The prescription drugs are a bit weird from what I've read, with mixed results across almost every one. Unfortunately, the worst results come from younger patients, like myself (19 years), even though experts say taking care of the problems early on is better. I would try anything natural first, strategies and herbs. If that doesn't help, then its your decision.

UZxeBrxQaa	Depends on the stage of the cold sore.  If it had crusted over, then it is unlikely to be shedding viral cells.  If it was in the active, blister, stage, then infection becomes more likely, but certainly not guaranteed.    Time will tell.|`|4BoteYDwaa	It's pretty likely, but CARMEX can clear it up pretty quickly.

You can also get herpes simplex virus form people who carry it but do not have any active sores at the time.
m7r6FHw1aa	The formula for losing weight is simple - eat less and move more - the difficulties arise when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are loads of stumbling blocks out there aren't there?! The only diet which definitely showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I shed 20 pounds, it definitely does produce success!
fmSuzK2Aaa	I had my first root canal last week and let me tell you that I am the biggest wuss in the world (especially when it comes to pain and dentists) but it really wasn't a big deal. My endodontist (root canal specialist) was really great and he could tell that I was really nervous and tried to calm me down before he started to numb me and then after he numbed me before he did any work on my tooth. The worst part of the whole ordeal was the novocaine injections - I was squirming so much that he and his assisstant had to hold me down while he was giving the shots and when he saw that I was so uncomfortable he waited until I was numb before he gave what he called would otherwise be a painful injection directly into the gum right next to the tooth and because he waited until I was numb, I didn't feel a thing. After that I really just felt a lot of pressure while he was cleaning out the canals of the tooth and filling the tooth with the restorative material. The only pain I had after being numbed was when he drilled the canal that was VERY inflamed - he said it was the worst he had seen in a long time - but once he got the inflammation out I didn't feel a thing.  Really I promise, from experience, root canals are definitely not as bad as people make them out to be. Root canals are so easy - they take longer than regular fillings and it gets really boring but they are so worth it - especially if you're having pain before hand. After my root canal, my mouth was a little sore from being propped open from an hour and a half and the feeling that I was punched in the mouth but with 2 advil, the pain is nearly nonexistant...  Good Luck!! You'll be fine - I promise it doesn't hurt, and coming from a really big wuss, you'll be fine :) Let us know how it goes...|`|cooHcA5Kaa	I have one tomorrow too - honest the procedure hurt less than my tooth, my jaw hurt more from my mouth being open than the actual root canal.  It wasn't fun, but it wasn't as horrible as I expected.|`|gIMZaY02aa	It's really no worse than having a cavity drilled...  Only it will most likely take a fair amount of time to complete.  My dentist had a rubber block for me to rest my jaw during my root canal, it was convenient.    The procedure for me was painless, same with the recovery.  The worst part for me was fearing it might not take.  You'll be fine.|`|io2Jstqxaa	no pain really.. i went to student dentist and i had to sit there for like 2 hours while they tried taking xrays.. jaw hurt from that but mostly theres the drilling sounds and grinding, that bothered me but not a hurting kind of bother.. don't worry, it'll be ok
FHRzgtqVaa	cardiac arrest is the sudden loss of heart function. you don't need to have been diagnosed with heart disease to have a cardiac arrest and symptoms generally don't appear until it is too late. Symptoms are loss of consciousness, pulse and normal breathing. Cardiac arrest is mostly caused by coronary heart disease.

Can you be at least a little specific?|`|TORBP6QIaa	I know that I have had 3 Cardiac Arrests and the only reason I am still here perfectly well is because I was in ICU recovering from open heart surgery when it happened.    The heart usually goes into an erratic rhythm (often V-fib) that does not pump blood efficiently and then it can stop pumping altogether and all heart function will cease.  It is an immediate medical emergency and they defibrillate you with the paddles to shock your heart back into rhythm.  The longer it takes to get you back into sinus rhythm the less chance you have of surviving without any side effects.  Hypothermia is often used to help patients recover with as few side effects as possible.    They had me in a drug induced coma and under a special cold air blanket for 4 days so my body and brain could rest.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arr...|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Cardiac arrest is when your heart stops beating.

The bad pain only lasted about 2 days while there was only a small bit of tenderness when i bit down for about 5 days after that.  All they do is put on a slightly thicker wire so its not as painful as when you get them on.  Goodluck!|`|GoNCzxAuaa	How bad the pain is varies from person to person.  It will feel like your teeth are being tugged a bit, and when you bite down it will be considerably worse.  It may feel like your teeth are kind of loose, or that when you bite down they don't feel secure in your gums, but that's normal.  The first time you get them tightened will hurt more than most other times getting them tightened, but it hurts a LOT less than when you first got your braces on.    If the pain bothers you, just take an over the counter pain reliever like Advil or ibuprofen, and avoid eating hard foods for a few days.|`|j7OfrcD0aa	dude its not bad at all ive gotten mine tightened liek 10 times doesnt hurt at all just a tad bit of pressure|`|UxnLrrSWaa	It's gonna hurt, for like at least 4 days.

3JKe5lr8aa	If you are using "eye drops" like Visine daily and you have been doing so for a long period of time (anything more than three days) that might be your problem.    Visine is not intended to be used for more than three days in a row. To do so causes the redness to continue. Your eyes become "addicted" to the medication in it and you experience rebound redness. Using more eye drops will not get rid of this redness. Only a medication holiday will.    So, if you are using Visine on a daily basis to try to rid yourself of the red eyes, try doing without it for a week or so.     If the red eyes remain, perhaps a trip to the eye doctor is in order.    You should also use the same caution with Rhoto drops as with Visine as the naphazoline and tetrahydralazine in the Rhoto drops is the same/similar to the active ingredient in Visine and can cause rebound redness as well. The only exception to the Rhoto eye drop caution is Rhoto Zi which merely contains povidone for lubricant and dry eye relief. All three other Rhoto choices, Vice, Vcool and Varctic, all contain one or the other of the drugs above that can cause rebound redness.|`|9dyPKI9Vaa	I agree dont be using so much visine.  if you have to use that much and it isnt even working...then stop.  throw out your visine and buy some rhotto.  it works wonders on red eyes.  and if that doesnt work then drops are not the solution.  but rhotto has a very cooling affect....VERY cooling. try some at walgreens. $6.|`|5AtpOkCFaa	be more specific

It may or may not ever happen again. See a doc if it does.. Same thing can happen when a cop get behind you in traffic..|`|CgwEfwOZaa	I donate blood pretty regularly.  I think what happened is:   1.  Were you wearing anything heavy? (i.e. heavy sweater, thick jacket?)..I think the extra heat could have caused you to black out.      2.  Being that we're lovely girls, we get oh-so-fun periods monthy.  This causes a lack of iron for some of us.  Low iron could possibly be another factor.  I'd invest in some type of multi-vitamin specially designed for women.  Ensure you take one every day.    3.  Are you afraid of needles/blood?
gIMZaY02aa	Having 5 root canals done is a fair amount of work, which will all most likely need crowns placed over them.  It will be quite costly, and there is a chance that the root canals will fail and you'll need to have them done all over again(most likely destroying the crown in the process).  But if all goes well, they'll likely be fully functional teeth and it's certainly cheaper than getting implants.    Unless you have severe gum disease, I'm not sure I'd go straight to the extraction route.  Just because something takes a bit(or a lot) of work doesn't mean it isn't worth it.  I'd much rather have real teeth that are crowned over dentures, though if you can afford implants(something like $3,000-$5,000 per) that might be the way to go.    I think you should see another dentist if at all possible, get a second opinion.|`|5aKUV5afaa	I'm not real clear on what teeth need the root canals. Either way, here's my advice.  Five root canals signal a huge problem. On any teeth.  I was also neglected, dentally, as a youth.  I got my wisdom teeth taken out, dealt with the back teeth with a few root canals, got braces cause some of my baby teeth were impacted.  After all that money, other problems started showing up.  Cavity on this tooth and that.  What people don't realize is that neglect shows up years and years later.  So you can do all this work, and come to the conclusion, I have bad teeth.  Get them all yanked and get dentures.  Or, you could not take my advice and spend your money and trips to the dentist, and the pain and the hassle to try to keep teeth you will eventually lose.  Good luck!

YOU CAN TALK TO HIM ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE!  TO TALK TO GOD, JUST SPEAK IN YOUR HEAD OR OUT LOUD.     (To start a relationship with God speak in your head, or out loud where you are):  Admit to Jesus that you have done wrong and that you want to change and do right.  Believe Jesus is God and receive Jesus as your savior.  Commit to and follow Jesus.    If you do not believe me, ask God to reveal Himself to you tonight in your dream and ask Him if He is real; or ask God to speak to you and ask Him if He is real. Wait and see or hear what He reveals to you.    Also, play Christian music (89.7 FM available on radio or online), talk to God (in your head, or out loud), read the bible (bible.com free bible reading online) and attend a good church that believes that Jesus is God and follows what the bible says.    ASK GOD TO DELIVER YOU FROM SADNESS.  ASK GOD TO GIVE YOU JOY.

Kxwyy0Eaaa	The body was made for whole, real foods, and whole, real foods for the body. (Paraphrase from one of the Pauline epistles. When that was written, processed junk had not been invented.) However, if you have been eating little to no real foods (i.e., you considered French fries a veggie and not the little sticks of artificial grease they really are), for years or your entire life, your body is learning to adjust. Also, the diarrhea might just be from not enough water, not enough fiber, I'm not really sure. The last time I had it was just from a bug.     When I wake up with a funky feeling tummy, it's usually because I didn't have my bedtime snack and I'm really hungry.|`|FxAD44Moaa	awww, someone who's been  eating processed food all their lives and now suddenly are trying to eat fresh whole foods.      can't take it?      tisk tisk..     then go back to eating  garbage...   leave the whole foods to those who have been eating them for years.    it'll save you and  us alot of trouble.      sorry,  it didn't work out for you...  better luck next life.

I turned 16 on Jan 4th, and I started my first period on July 10th of 2008 (last year=)  I was 15.  Since I was about 13, I have thought "Whats wrong with me??? Im a freak of nature." I was so jealous because all my friends started when they were 12 or 13. I always felt sick because of this.  I lived in a small town. All my aunts, friends & cousins thought, "I cant believe she hasnt started yet. Does she have a problem with growing? Take her to the docter!"      And then, FINALLY, in summertime, i got my period.  I remember exactly.   I was asleep with my sister in the living room.  But I felt wet. My first thought was (lol) "Hey, im not horny. why am i wet???" so i went to my bedroom. i felt myself. when i looked at my fingers, there was blood! I thought, "WTF>????!?!!! OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!! fooooooking finally!! but wait....what if its just red marker or something?" so i went to the bathroom.    and yupp, it was Aunt Flo, comin' to say hello! =D  i was so happy.|`|lwzUXm9haa	I was 14...

MqWFGPwkaa	I am not sure that you can lose weight that fast. One pound equals 3500 calories. This means that for every pound that you want to lose you must eat 3500 calories less. Losing weight to fast is not good for you either. When on a strict diet, the body starts to burn muscle not fat.    The easiest way to lose weight is cut the fat out of your diet.  One pat of butter is 100 calories compared to an apple which is only 60. You will see that this is true if you read the nutrition label on prepared food labels in the stores. The highest calories are from fat.    My advice is to stay away from prepared foods. Make your own and use less fat. Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. And lastly try and drink at least eight 8 ounce glasses of water daily. Many people think they are hungry when the body just wants a drink of water.    My best,  Hope    P S restaurants and fast food joints are out of bounds for a while.|`|KUVW3ZRuaa	i used to weigh more than 200 pounds, and this worked for me.    im down to 150 now so hopefully it will work for you.    i just started biking a mile a day. and now im in great shape.|`|50HTGzrlaa	Limit yourself on what foods you eat.

If you can't lose weight it's because the chemicals aren't either burning due to some other chemical not being there.  Also, it could also rely on what you eat after you exercise etc.  Or it could be genetics.    Best thing to do is ask a dietician.  Or Subway Diet I guess.|`|6t76bgS3aa	smoking keeps your weight down|`|ICOmnGIUaa	if there was a quick way to lose weight that company would make billions.

7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Yes but not doing just bench presses alone. You need to do a total body workout routine that includes.  Military presses  bicep curls  reverse curls  triceps presses  Lat pull downs  shoulder shrugs  setups  leg raises  bent over rows  squats  dead lifts  bent over reverse flies or reverse butterflies  chest flies or butterflies  and for bench presses:  standard bench press  decline bench press  incline bench press    The best way is to do a combination of heavy {power}lifting and body building {lighter more reps}    As for routine mix the above up so that your are doing around 6 to ten different exercises each session: But don't get in a routine of doing certain exercises because your body will get accustomed {assimilated} to them which decreases the effectiveness.|`|PxEsutQNaa	Well, the bench press works your upper chest like no other. It is a major, well-respected lift for a reason. People wouldn't do it if it didn't work.    If you want a stronger upper body, be sure to focus on your back as well, not just your chest. Pull-ups, bench press, fly press, bicep curls, one arm DB rows, military press, and push press should all be present in your workout if want a trule admirable upper body. Just don't forget to train everything else though.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	If you're looking for bulk, heavy weight, minimum reps is what you're looking for.  3 sets of 3-4 reps.

x0flaLfUaa	My doc put me on Atenolol which is a beta blocker and its worked a treat. I've had lots of other medication but this one is good because it stops the physical symptoms of social anxiety and panicking. I can honestly say that I've never looked back. I've done lots sessions with councillors and psychiatrists too which have helped. I hope that this helps you, I know each case is individual, but maybe something like this would help you too?|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, and 38, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART).  Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.    One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and scream out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or an alfoil one: "I am Zeguxy, Overlord of the Andromeda galaxy. Bow before me, primitive Earthlings, or I shall vaporise your backward planet!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.    It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people.     Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).|`|HrDL4Njzaa	Start with small steps. Don't throw yourself into a situation where you know you'll being gasping for air. If your friends know, tell them you wanna start off by them bringing a friend out for a coffee, so you can get introduced to the idea of speaking to somebody you don't know, then ask the friend to bring 2 people you don't know and build it up from there. Once you've passed that initial moment of breaking the awkwardness you should be fine. Just remember that you can always leave.   Best of luck m'dear.|`|Jfcn58rVaa	i have social anxiety. After i graduated high school i decided that i needed to see a therapist because it was only progressively getting worse. I never went on medication, but rather we talked about ways to keep myself calm in social situations and.   We also talked about the fact that i had to get out there and experience social situations if i ever wanted to get better at them  So i did. And when every time i had the opportunity to go i felt that gut feeling that i would so much rather hide out in my bedroom, i went out. And i tried to talk to people, always trying to put the conversation topics back onto them is a good technique.   So, now, 2 years later, while i know that my fear will never go away, i feel like i can handle it better.  I've realized that since it is always going to be there i can't let it control my life. Really the only way to get over a fear is to face it. Not even get over it really, but just to be able to deal with it
BJuHbQXfaa	Hopefully you washed the area after the got the cut and covered it with something. Keep the area covered and keep putting some antibiotic cream on it, it should heal in a few days. If it becomes more red and you see puss around the cut then you need to go to the doctor because then it is infected.  Good Luck!|`|dBoC8fR2aa	How can anyone tell you the conditions of your injured finger without seeing it. Ask the doctor to check on it.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	How long ago did you get the cut?  If it's been more than a couple of days and the area is swollen as well, it's probably an infection.  You should show it to your boss as soon as possible and see if it's covered under workers' compensation.    Keep an eye on your wrist and forearm.  If a red streak develops, go to the emergency room at once (it means the infection is spreading).|`|8y4cFoiNaa	dry|`|0eq7uuyLaa	When a cut is red, it's because red blood cells are all rushing to that area to help heal it. If it's infected, it will swell and there will be pus in and around it. It's probably just dry....use some neosporin to keep it clean and moist, and cover it with a band aid or two while you're working.
Z7TzJWX4aa	yes.  the fishy odor, however, indicates something else.    yeast infections do not produce fishy odor.  typically, the ONLY symptom of a yeast infection is itching, which is what you have.    no study has found that sex and toys successfully pass yeast infections.    if it's your first one, you need to see a doctor.  go to planned parenthood if you are poor--they can help you.  it is important to NEVER use OTC yeast infection products unless you are absolutely sure.|`|vDnIvMoVaa	it is very possible it might be a yeast infection and if you don't have the money to see a doctor they have the new test kits you can buy at the store next to the over the counter yeast infection medicine and it will help you see if you have a yeast infection.

rev4lrn0aa	Usually it should come at it's regular time but it is possible for it to come earlier because you are putting a bunch of hormones in your body. As long as it is a normal period you have nothing to worry about. If it is super light, you should probably take a pregnancy test in a week or two just to be sure that the light bleeding wasn't implantation bleeding. I'm sure you are fine though, for the most part the Plan B pill works pretty well.

I would take another pregnancy test, use a good one EPT, First Response and if it still comes out negative, I would look and find a Planned Parenthood or County Heath Dept. and have them do a blood test.  You are too young to care for a baby and since you do not want one, you do have options.  As a woman, you have the right to an abortion, many people don't think that is an option, but it is.  There is also having the baby and giving it up for adoption.  There are many women out there, that can't get pregnant, and would give anything to have a baby to love.  At least you admit you are too young and people that don't like kids should not have them.  See what the tests say, then go from there.  As of this moment, as a women in the US, you have choices, and one of those is abortion.  It is your decision, your beliefs, no one else.    Good Luck, I hope you are not pregnant.

It is possible that they hit a nerve while they were doing it, and that is why.  Have you talked to your doc about it?|`|490e4f226b74a4050a4f5768c24d97e9aa	I also had one and the biggest part of the pain went away in a week, but every now and again afterward, I also had the same experience with the cold affecting my hip. Mention it to your Dr. I'm glad your procedure went well.
ugQPb744aa	Was she diagnosed after her stint in A&E? it could be a manic episode.  Call her GP or psychiatrist?  If you try to talk to her and she seems psychotic then you may wish to call an ambulance just to be on the safe side.   For the meantime, call a family friend ASAP so you're not dealing with this on their own.    EDIT: If she's been diagnosed as psychotic then you really should call someone ASAP an ambulance will perhaps be the best thing, it doesn't have to be the scary fuss with the flashy lights and sirens.  In the meantime, try not to do anything to aggravate her and CALL SOMEONE, you shouldn't have to go through this on your own.|`|4WzPs7Rlaa	This must be very upsetting and scary for you, I would phone/text one of your friends or a family member so your not feeling alone. Try and get them to come round, if it's a friend then ask their parents to come too. If you get the number for your local police station online (not 999) you can always phone them and chat to them, as they can come out and advise your mum to turn it down.     Once she has turned the music down I strongly advise you contacting the crisis team to discuss your thoughts and feelings about your mum. They can make things happen (change medication/arrange a short stay in hospital) and help your mum cope with her illness. If it's an emergency then call an ambulance.   Good luck xx|`|EkdRA0qbaa	the police may not be needed right now.   call a close, adult, family friend and explain the situation. ask them to please come over so you do not have to deal with this all on your own.   then together, you can call the hospital where she was getting help.   if she becomes violent or looks as if she might hurt herself, you or anyone else, call the police.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Keep asking her, and stress how much it's upsetting you.  She may be psychotic but she's still your mother and hopefully she doesnt want to hurt your feelings.  Offer her a compramise like suggesting she put her earphones in, or lend her your MP3 player.  Later on ask her to take her medication, try not to make a big deal of it.  Tell her that if she doesnt like being on the medication, she can always come off them but you think it's best that she follows the doctors advice because you're worried about her and love her.  If things continue to be unstable then call out a doctor again and explain she's not been taking her medication.  Good luck.|`|sfBKFSEfaa	I agree with Swandive.  You may have to call an ambulance before the neighbors call the police.  Either way, she will get the treatment she needs.  You didn't mention if the doctor she saw last week prescribed any medication, but obviously its not helping yet.
OxcEIDBpaa	The pill can cause you to gain some weight, but as long as you watch what you eat and exercise some you should be just fine. The plus side is bigger breasts :) I've noticed that my skin has become more clear and while on your period the cramps are hardly noticeable. I used to get them really bad too, and now I can't really tell much of a difference. Its really nice! If you are taking the pill as a contraceptive you should decide on a time to take the pill (say noon) and take it at that time everyday. If you are just taking the pill to get rid of those horrible cramps and irregular period then you probably wont have to worry too much about taking it at the same time, but probably should make an effort to. Anyway, Good luck!|`|bsvTJwvfaa	Not everyone puts on weight when they take the pill - some people find their boobs get bigger while others' bodies don't change at all.    Go and ask your gp about different types of pill. There is a combined pill (containing both oestrogen and progesterone) that most women can take, or a mini-pill (progesterone only) that women can take if they can't take oestrogen for any reason. There are also hormonal implants and injections and lots of other solutions to your problem.    Good luck!|`|5zqfDEXZaa	well for some girls it works and some it just realy messes with their time of the month and dont trust that it is 100% safe if your having sex my baby is a year old now because i thought it would work
ItJzrvQ4aa	an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|am5ESJHgaa	I agree with KLC. The plank is great. To do it lie flat with your hands and elbows flat on the ground and then straighten your upper arms so that there is \a 90 degree angle between your upper arms and forearms. hold your body there *exactly* straight and hold for about 15 seconds. Repeat three or four times. Do this once a day and slowly increase the time that you hold it for.     This is a great exercise for increasing core strength and balance.|`|PGvxouUzaa	skipping rope|`|AA10811426	You can pick up one of those anti burst gym balls pretty cheap these days - they work great for abs, legs, arms... you can really incorporate an entire workout at home using the balls.    http://www.electronichealing.co.uk/produ...|`|ykdsCpDPaa	TRI-SETS  -normal crunch 1 set of 30  -bicycles 1 set of 20  -full crunch 1 set of 10  1 minute rest repeat for 3 tri-sets    -bicycles 1 set of 30  -hip thrust 1 set of 12  -leg lifts 6 inches off the ground 1 set of 20  1 minute rest in between tri-sets repeat for 3 tri-sets    :D good luck   diet and nutrition is important too|`|l6ipfYD9aa	domble lifting  daily|`|lSL6BdX6aa	The Plank is a good one that strengthens your core, as well as the Bicycle, which works your abs, core, and even your rear!
M9SZQoHWaa	i'd advice you to get that checked out right away. I dont want to alarm you but my dad experienced the exact same thing like you did. he thought it might be something caught in his eye but when he went to get it checked out, they found a growth in his eye. he had to have surgery to get the growth (melanoma) out. if it is the same thing, catching it early could save your eye.|`|cxNLOPHNaa	At your age it's probably a harmless "floater", if it's a dark spot that moves as you blink. If it's a flash of light, or has a "spiderweb" effect... Then you must get to an eye doctor, that's a sign of retinal detachment. You should see your eye doctor anyway, just to be sure.    Since you wear contacts... If your eye begins to itch, or starts to get red, also see a doctor right away. You don't want a case of Keratitis or a Corneal Ulcer.    I'm not an eye doctor. But, 5 years ago I suffered an occlusion of the main retinal vein. My ophthalmologist gave me a lot of reading material on eyes and eye care.|`|3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	The only way to tell for sure is to see your doctor. Floaters are dead parts of old cells that float in between your lens and retina. If you have 1 or more floaters it is not harmful unless you suddenly get so many that they obscure your vision. Then you need to see the eye doctor right away.    Most people get floaters as they get older but they will not go away as 1 person said. If that is what you have they will increase in number as you get older. I'm not sure when I noticed my first one but I think I was about 35 to 40 y/o. Now I have about 20 of them but they are only a slight nuisance.|`|HJSLZefPaa	Oh I had them before, they are called Eye Floaters.    They are harmless clumps of cells that cast a shadow in your retina. They also go away over time.
ParFJxnSaa	Exercise, but not within 2 hours of bedtime. Have a warm bath, or shower, an hour before bedtime, then a glass of very warm milk, possibly with Horlicks, or one of the herbal teas, below, and use dimmer lighting. Put your mind in a position where it wants to shut itself off, and sleep. See insomnia treatments, in much more detail than can be included here, in section 3, at ezy build, below. Use one of the relaxation methods, in bed, after lights out, in sections 2, 11, 2.c, or 2.i, but they can take some time to learn, (progressive muscular relaxation excepted) so learn and become proficient in their use during the day.    An alternative is to use the EFT, in section 53, and pages 2.q, and 2.o, saying to yourself: "Even though I currently have a sleep disorder, I deeply and completely accept myself." (or choose your own wording) while you use the acupressure. Some more; quick, and easy to learn, are at http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm The progressive muscle relaxation, (most easily learned) guided imagery, and mindfulness breathing are known to be effective.    Find out which works best for you, in the daylight hours, so you will be prepared, come bedtime. For many people, a good idea is to develop a set "wind down" routine for the last hour before bedtime, so your subconscious mind learns that it is time to put thinking aside, and prepare for mindfulness, (awareness, without cogitation/purposeful thought) or the EFT, in preparation for sleep, but the idea with mindfulness is to not even think about sleeping: just drift off, naturally, during exercising those techniques.    Avoid TV, computer, or anything exciting in this hour, although reading a BORING! book is a good idea. I suggest that you try using the EMDR variant, below, prior to the mindfulness, or the progressive muscular relaxation, but after the EFT, if that method is chosen. Experiment, to find which combination works best for you.     In section 3 at ezy build: INSOMNIA: PAGE O - INSOMNIA: A COMPREHENSIVE POST a variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing therapy is shown, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from insomnia, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and anxiety. It is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective; although it is easy to be dismissive of such a seemingly unusual technique, give it a good tryout, for at least a few weeks, to see if it is effective in your case. I learned it from a book by a published clinical psychologist, on depression insomnia, and now use it every night, and find it works well.    No coffee, tea, or other caffeine (see list in section 7) within 6 hrs of bedtime! Try a cup of chamomile herbal tea, an hour before bedtime, and employ many of the techniques in section 3. Others may prefer Sleepytime, by Celestial Seasonings, Relax, Be Sleepy, or valerian root (valerian "hangovers" possible), from supermarket tea, or health food aisles. Milk, or cream should not be used with herbal tea. http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris|`|z76XO1UHaa	listen to music not to loud just low or read a book in bed cuss your mind is not on reading the book its on sleeping since you are already in bed|`|edudNyaLaa	Although not the most healthy option, you walk into any drug store or supermarket and buy sleep aids such as Unisom, Tylenol PM, Advil PM, etc. I can pretty much guarantee that any of these will put you to sleep within 30 minutes of taking them. Again, these aren't med's that you can take every night. They can be harmful if you abuse them. When it comes to natural ways, limit caffeine intake (or other stimulants), physical exercize and there are some natural sleep aids. At any drug store you can buy Melatonin, a completely safe, natural substance.|`|pQ10zbcDaa	Just continue writing and drawing it doesn't matter at all, some time along the way you will learn to battle it.

At least in my case it is. If you find yourself unable to woo yourself back to sleep within a short period of time, about an hour or so, it would probably be best to get sleeping aids or medications to help with this.

UZxeBrxQaa	Get an electric blanket and allow your body temperature to rise slowly.      The bath is not a good idea.    A warming pad that you can sit on can help as well.  This allows the heat to gently infiltrate your body tissues.    Consider investing in some really good long underwear and alpaca wool socks.  It will make a very real difference.|`|Ddb5821Jaa	I would be more concerned about prevention of getting cold.  wear layers or better clothing.
8ebace53ced50f1918907901847f7907aa	Hi there,  I am sorry for what you are going through. It can be very frustrating and exhausting. Even though it doesn't seem like "typical" period symptoms, I know exactly what you go through, I have always had extremely painful periods, to the point of passing out and throwing up. I also am a very heavy bleeder and I can hardly get out of bed, even after taking prescription pain killers. I usually force myself to go to work until I pass out. I thought it was normal for a long time, sweety it isn't. I am not trying to scare you, but I was just recently diagnosed with a condition called Endometriosis and it sounds like you could possibly have it.  Here are some of the symptoms, which you don't have to have all of them to have Endo.  * Pain, which can be:  o Pelvic pain.  o Severe menstrual cramps.  o Low backache 1 or 2 days before the start of the menstrual period (or earlier), becoming less during the period.  o Rectal pain.  o Pain during bowel movements.  * Infertility, which may be the only sign that you have endometriosis. Between 20% and 40% of women who are infertile have endometriosis.1  * Abnormal bleeding. This can include:  o Blood in the urine or stool.  o Some vaginal bleeding before the start of the menstrual period (premenstrual spotting).  .    I would definitely find a gyn to see. I hope that this helps you and that you start to feel better soon. Sure makes for one hell of a week, doesn't it? If you have any more questions or need anything, just shoot me an email.|`|0eq7uuyLaa	As far as I know, sickness and diarrhea doesn't usually accompany a period, first or otherwise.

Also you may want to get seen by your Doctor recently i was having really bad stomach cramps, diarhea and vomiting i saw my dr and i had a really bad UTI (urinary tract infection). So i was put on antibiotics and i feel alot better so talk to someone your comfortable with and then see a dr cause if it is a UTI you don't want to let it go you would need antibiotics.
sI4MK0KAaa	i finally got rid of ringworm (i had it on my left foot), but after using a cream, i still wear the same pair of thongs that ive worn from the time i got ringworm to the present day, and i have not caught the infection again. from my understanding, ringworm only spreads when there is heat or moisture. thats why doctors always recommend in public showers (such as at a local beach or pool) you wear thongs in there.    basically, you should rest easy, as you will not get it as a result of you having stepped on the carpet or bed again.

If you do not believe me, ask God to reveal Himself to you tonight in your dream and ask Him if He is real; or ask God to speak to you and ask Him if He is real. Wait and see or hear what He reveals to you.    Also, play Christian music (89.7 FM available on radio or online), talk to God (in your head, or out loud), read the bible (bible.com free bible reading online) and attend a good church that believes that Jesus is God and follows what the bible says.|`|bYxyuZDUaa	Sorry do you mean mental health?  or help with mental problems?    It certainly can be very useful in creating a relaxed and resourceful state of mind.  It is also used to teach people new behaviours and new ways of thinking.    I would say for most people, with "common or garden" mental health problems, hypnosis can be very effective    Some people also use hypnosis for more severe problems such as schizophrenia, psychosis, severe drug and alcohol addiction.  However in these circumstances the results of the hypnosis can be unpredictable and I would not recommend this course of action unless working with an extremely experienced hypnotist.

And trust me, you can't just make your arms SKINNY. If you want to lose weight and tone your arms, your arms are going to have to be somewhat built. Extremely skinny people have skinny arms because they're skinny all over and just skin and bones.  Do a lot of exercises that involve your biceps and triceps and shoulder muscles. Push ups are good to start with, but you should be a little more creative.

And then you're going to have an even harder time losing it the second time. I know. I did it back when i was in high school. Boy was I dumb. If you're smart, you'll up your calorie intake. Your body is going to go into starvation mode because you are burning off everything you eat. And when it does that, your body is storing fat. Yah, not a good thing. You aren't going to be able to get rid of that.   Clearly you have your mind set, but you need to really think about the long run here, more than just 3 months from now. For whatever reason you need to lose 40 pounds in 3 months, that is kind of ridiculous.

IgXivJJcaa	according to the Mosby's Drug Reference The dosage for adults age 12 and older is 25 to 50 mg by mouth.at bedtime for SLEEP  . (This is a once a night dose just to help you sleep)  So as long as you are not allergic or your doctor has not advised you against taking this medication, you can take 2 pills at once. HOWEVER THE DOSAGE FOR  ALLERGIES IS AS FOLLOWS: 25 mg by mouth every 4 hours and not to exceed 100 mg in 24 hrs. That is a total of just 4 pills in 24 hrs. I would contact my MD. before taking two 25 mg tablets every 4 hours because you will exceed the recommended dosage according the drug guide.

m5K9U8s8aa	Don't worry! We've all been there.  I'm about a month post-op knee surgery, and before I had it done I was scared s hitless!     I think, especially being your first operation (this was my first too) you have the right to have the jitters. It's a scary thought.    But just remember, that you are in the care of professionals, and unless told so, there are no fatal risks or complications that should occur.     As for relaxing, I don't know about your hospital or the specifics of your surgery, but before I went under, the nurse gave me a sedation pill. This is basically a relaxer, so I was super calm, when normally, I would've been freaking.    So, just keep positive thoughts, and just stick it out.  It will be okay!    Good luck!|`|NoGmacqNaa	sum people just adont feel secure around needles or things that. its very normal. It just ur nerves.  Just remember its all gonna b ok in the end thats what i did when i got stitches on my shins!|`|iiRU9kEoaa	everyones scared over something. i think ur scared because it may hurt. dw they will numb the part where they are stitching.|`|FQHb5MS0aa	Its like looking at a needle going into your arm.  If you think about it, if you don't look at it.  Its not a big deal.|`|qh9EOXKOaa	it's just anxiety I get all the time before I go in for an op when the just put me under for 5mins to break my arm back I was freaking out so in other words it's normal what I did to relax myself was just listen to some music or watch tv or somthing just to keep my mind off it!|`|7dzQQZQuaa	well it is natural to be scared of these kind of things, but your only focussing on negatives    relaxation techniques- dont think about it, or use a stress ball , whatever lol    i am 1million % u will be fine especially on a low risk operation such as this|`|IegOHQXOaa	I believe it's completely and totally normal to be terrified about having surgery. I know I was mortified when I heard I would have to have to have an operation on my knee. It IS a scary thing because truthfully you're going to be open and unconscious and it IS fine to be a little put off by it.     As for relaxing- I don't know you personally of course but I find a good way to relax is to not dwell on the fact. I can't tell you to not think about it but don't harp on it. Try to distract yourself by being around others, go have fun! It'll be over before you know it trust me. One second you're counting the next you're waking up.     Good luck!
sCD1YaAmaa	A friend of mine had numerous "golfball sized" lumps and it was Cancer!  If a person is REALLY worried about his/her health they will go ASAP to a Clinic/Hospital.    You should tell her to seek medical attention ASAP...Once again...ASAP.|`|XDf8xSyyaa	It might not be cancer.  Only having tests will say for sure.  But it could possibly be a benign mass.  She needs to be seen by a doctor.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	See a Dr...|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Only the doctor can help you, not us.|`|gRwYBmKQaa	yes.. it certainly sounds like you broke your nose.Being swollen,and having "black-eyes",are a major sign.Also if you touch your nose,does it make crunching or crackling sound,or pain and difficulty breathing through your nostrils?I would go see your doctor.For now take Advil,for the pain and swelling,prop your head up while your sleeping.The doctor probably won't do surgery,if anything to correct a crooked nose they may have to aline it,(which will hurt) and tape the bridge of the nose so it heals straight.the best of luck to you:)|`|7yRPrKBHaa	ok. first things first: did you hear a crack when you got elbowed? this is the first sign. next, it would hurt if you pressed up on the bone towards your forehead by placing your finger underneath the nose (in-between your nostrils) and pressed gently!!!!!!! upwards. the other this is: are you having trouble breathing??? this is another sign of a broken nose. i would check out webmd.com and enter broken nose for more detailed info.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	there is little to do with a broken nose.  as long as you didn't tear the piece inside that separates the nostrils, and its hard to do, then its fine.  if its crooked then when the swelling goes down after 5 or so days go to the doc and they will realign it.  but you might find its fine when the swelling goes down.  most likely your just worried and staring at it too much, if you can't really tell then it prob fine.  they don't tape up noses usually or anything, just ice it.  and you don't need surgery.  it might be a little off from the soccer injury anyway
KkSW6EViaa	this is still self harm, & it is important that you tell your therapit, even if you don't think you are really hurting yourself.  tell her what's going on before things get worse.    good luck!|`|ULx2vAB1aa	if you do any damage to your skin intentionally, and it leaves a mark, you are self harming|`|AnyO0eGLaa	Cutting yourself is considered to be self-harm...if you tell your therapist he may refer you to a psychiatrist, who in turn would prescribe medication....it's your life...Carpe diem!|`|X9v50pmCaa	GOD SAYS TO NOT CUT YOURSELF!!!!  THE REASON WHY GOD TELLS PEOPLE TO NOT CUT THEMSELVES IS BECAUSE IT HARMS THEM.    STOP CUTTING YOURSELF!  YOU ARE ALIVE! YOU MATTER!  TAKE CARE OF THE BODY AND SOUL GOD GAVE YOU!     ASK GOD IN YOUR HEAD OR OUT LOUD TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR STRESS AND DEPRESSION.  ALSO ASK GOD TO TAKE AWAY THE DESIRE THAT YOU HAVE TO CUT YOURSELF.    GOD IS THE GREAT COUNSELOR!  HE CAN HELP YOU!  JUST LET HIM AND BELIEVE!    (Start a relationship with God speak in your head, or out loud where you are):  Admit to Jesus that you have done wrong and that you want to change and do right.  Believe Jesus is God and receive Jesus as your savior.  Commit to and follow Jesus.    If you do not believe me, ask God to reveal Himself to you tonight in your dream and ask Him if He is real; or ask God to speak to you and ask Him if He is real. Wait and see or hear what He reveals to you.    Also, play Christian music (89.7 FM available on radio or online), talk to God (in your head, or out loud), read the bible (bible.com free bible reading online) and attend a good church that believes that Jesus is God and follows what the bible says.|`|mDNeumBmaa	It is still self harm, at the very least it has the posibility to lead to larger damage done to yourself, when the little cuts stop being enough to "make you feel alive".  I think you should definitely share this with your therapist as you may not be clearly interpreting your actions and the true motivations behind it. It sounds like you are trying to justify or minimize the seriousness of what you're doing and a professional will be able to be objective and help you work out what is really driving you. Whatever you do, know that you are a valuable person who deserves a healthy, happy life.  good luck!!!|`|0cbbecbdc82615f79e12b103dd58a90caa	I know exactly what you mean about doing it to feel alive. You've probably been through so much that you feel numb to most of it now. I spent so many yeas feeling numb. I used to feel so blank that I'd start to panic because I knew that I shouldn't feel like that-the people around me seemed to be normal with their feelings and I didn't know why I couldn't be. Whenever I did it, I'd feel a rush of relief that it hurt and that I could feel myself hating myself (if that makes sense) and so it became addictive.  Its all very well for people to say don't do it, God doesn't like it! but those are most likely the ones who haven't been through whatever you're going through. I don't think God does like it, but I can completely understand why you do it. Speak to you Therapist and tell them whats going on. Discuss it with them and maybe come to an alternative to feeling alive. A good alternative is to put an elastic band round your wrist and ping it hard against your skin. It sounds weird, but it really works.  I really hope that you are able to sort it all out in your head and heart. There is always another way instead of pain and death but its hard to see it when you're in the thick of it. I'll be praying for you.

It works quickly and also numbs the pain of the sore.|`|nyl8cmj8aa	Like the person before said, rinse with iodized salt water. Brush your teeth after every meal since decomposing food and plaque in your mouth just make it irritated and bigger. When brushing, try not to touch the sore because toothpaste has an ingredient in it that makes sores worse.     Don't eat spicy, fried, or greasy food since they probably trigger sores (it is not known what makes canker sores appear but it is suggested that a low immune system causes them). When eating, try to chew on the side the sore is not on and drink through a straw. Drink lots of vegetable juices and take in Vitamin C.     If it starts to get really annoying or if you want results quick, go to your nearest drugstore and buy some canker sore patches. These patches are about 10 dollars a box. They're made of special tropical herbs that cool your sore down. It may feel weird but don't bite down on the patch once it's stuck on your sore. That will open the sore more. Wait until the whole patch is dissolved. Your sore should be much better.     If all else fails, you can always remove it surgically by laser, but those treatments are expensive and take a few days to work.|`|0pqZsSRYaa	rinse your mouth with salt water... it will sting, but it cleanses... and gargle with hydrogen peroxide. then dab on some oragel and in a few days it should be feeling well enough to get your lip peirced.    just remember piercings make people more prone to infection so when you get it make sure to clean it.

Mhnc42hdaa	Sex it great. It really is an amazing thing between two people that love each other. Do wait till you are ready so you can relax enough to realize how amazing sex is. Do use condoms and a dental dam if he goes down on you. If you feel safe against STD's you can relax and enjoy.|`|iUFIlbNgaa	If you feel that you're ready, then you should go for it.  Keep in mind that if you do end up getting pregnant, you would end up with a huge amount of responsibility on your end.  Sometimes the pills and the condoms don't work.  My suggestion is once you're in the "mood", just go for it, and don't think about all the different consequences.  If you're that worried about getting STD's, have your boyfriend tested at your doctors office.  For extra protection, use a female condom (instead of a male condom... it's harder to put on but is supposed to help prevent STD's and HIV's, as well as sperm.)  But don't do it if you don't think you're ready.  Hope this helps! =]|`|CzdxFiRLaa	Hi Jesse,    You are not yet ready to commit to having sexual intercourse.  Don't push it, or worry about it. Your boyfriend seems to be a sensible type and is not going to force the situation.  The best thing the both of you can do is to continue talking and sharing your feelings and thoughts.     You will know when the time is right, it may be a planned event or spontaneous, catching you both by surprise.  Just be relaxed about it and enjoy each other's bodies as you are doing.|`|o0GPDE4Maa	Just wait until YOU are ready. If you feel ready, and then you quickly change your mind, Your not. Just wait. Maybe its for the best.|`|kHX1h7LFaa	Discarding the STDs and the pregnancy I would tell you to go for it. It really seems like you like this guy and he feels like sharing this with you, something which I think would be an interesting new experience for both of you. I would also advice you not to think about it as "losing your virginity"... take out the losing part, you are not losing anything, you're gaining new experiences and growing up. I think the "losing" part should be exchanged for a "sharing". You are sharing a new experience with him, go for it. Virginity is not a possession you could lose or win, its just a state of mind. You are what ever you want, yourself is intangible, you are yourself and that's it. No one can take your virginity away, you just share it with someone. If in the end it doesn't work as planned, go on... share experiences with someone new.    Hope it helps :)    Edit: And pills/condoms, DO WORK. Don't listen to the paranoia guys.

a251091accc67168a71c0efdd9fee660aa	I have keratosis pilaris as well. (I actually posted a question on it tonight.) It wont' go away as you get older, in fact it gets worse with age. I've had it since I was a kid and it was at first on my upper arms and thighs, it's now starting to move down to the rest of my arms and legs and I'm 16. Exfoliate and moisturize religiously. And drink lots of water. You could go to a dermatologist, but what they gave me didn't help as much as what a regular doctor gave me. There's a site for people who have keratosis pilaris, you should check it out, there are a lot of threads about things people have tried.   http://www.keratosispilaris.org/     I've been researching and some people have said that Sea Buckthorn helps their bumps, so I'm going to try that.   You could compare your symptoms with this girls, she has a theory on it.   http://www.keratosispilaris.org/general-...

The best thing is to buy Vaseline Intensive care cocoa butter gel.  It's a clear light brown bottle - found at the drug store.  Use that with a lufa or  buff puff every day in the shower.  After you pat dry apply a cream that helps add a hint of color.  Take vitamins e, b6 and b12 and drink a lot of water.

4bedkpvLaa	Alternative Names        Children and stuttering; Speech disfluency   Definition        Stuttering is a speech disorder that involves involuntary hesitation, repetition ("ca-ca-ca-can"), or prolongations ("llllllike") while speaking.    Causes        About 5% of children aged 2-5 go through a short period of stuttering, but this phase is very brief. For a small percentage (less than 1%), the stuttering progresses from simple repetition of consonants to repetition of words and phrases. Later, vocal spasms develop with a forced, almost explosive sound to the speech.    Stuttering tends to run in families, but it is unclear to what extent genetic factors are important. There is also evidence that stuttering may be associated with some neurological events, such as stroke or traumatic brain injuries. Psychological components tend to make the symptoms worse or better within each case.    Stuttering is rarely considered a psychological problem. Stressful social situations and anxiety, however, can make symptoms worse. Surprisingly, people with significant speech difficulty often don't stutter when singing or when they are alone talking to themselves. Stuttering tends to persist into adulthood more frequently in boys than in girls.    Symptoms        Symptoms of stuttering may include:    Hesitancy in starting sentences or phrases   Prolonged pauses while speaking   Repeating sounds, syllables, or words   Very long sounds within words   Other symptoms that might be seen with stuttering include:    Eye blinking   Involuntary movements of the head or other body parts   Jaw jerking   Children with mild stuttering are often unaware of their stuttering. In more severe cases, children may show greater awareness, accompanied by facial movements, anxiety, and increased stuttering when they are asked to speak.    Exams and Tests        No testing is usually necessary. The diagnosis of stuttering may require consultation with a speech pathologist.|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Stutter.|`|SfatAG9Gaa	Yea, you stutter.|`|7Z3hWNewaa	Yes, it's sometimes called Verbal Non-fluency or Speech Disfluency. However, the term stuttering is acceptable in a medical environment. It's often also called stammering.    It is all an umbrella term for speech impediments that result in interjected pauses in speech, prolongation of certain sounds or involuntary sound repetition.|`|Prm1ImPPaa	stutterer|`|PrarLmbxaa	Speech disfluency

It greatly reduces the possibility of viral shedding.    Incidentially, viral shedding only occurs during the initial stages of an outbreak.

On the other hand, maybe he will be relieved cuz he was going to tell you the same thing, but really just gather positive info on Google about the likelihood of transmission and tell him now, not 2morro, now!|`|s5kVBEmoaa	Wow, the person who answered right before me is rude!    Anyhow, sweetie, if I were you, I'd just tell him calmly, and with plenty of information on hand (talk to a doctor or look on google, you want to be informed about this). Don't wait until he's trying to get you in the mood for sex to tell him. Tell him as soon as possible, and if I were you I'd add in the story about where you got it so that he doesn't get the wrong idea. As long as you do that, he should be impressed that you had the courage to tell him, and you'll feel better once you don't have to worry about how to tell him anymore. Best of luck! =)|`|IgXivJJcaa	I would reassure him that everything is going to be okay. You should always wear a condom, even between outbreaks. There is no way to tell when another outbreak will occur and skin sheds also making it possible to transmit it to him when you are not having an outbreak. You should also be on a medication for it to help reduce the number of outbreaks, not only for him, but it is painful to you as well. I think as long as you are honest and in a loving committed relationship he should understand. You should show him the website valtrex.com. It is very useful for educating people, and it may help him to understand better. Good luck!

M3k9GOSsaa	Dear Person,  I really do know how you feel. It is very tough to feel like you are the only one feeling the way that you do. But, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Repeat: Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.    Don't listen to other people's negative comments, they should consider having compassion for someone going through a rough time, because one day they may be in a situation where they need someone to listen to their case.    First, I don't think that you are crazy. However, I think that finding a doctor to help your situation might be an appropriate thing to do. It is hard to say don't take the medicine that is making you feel better, but finding a solution to fix the problem and not suppress the symptoms (then it wears off) might be a better alternative. If you can, talk to someone about it.    You seem to be a smart person that can tell that you have a problem and want to solve it. Just because you feel like you can't cure the problem doesn't mean that you can't be treated. There may be alternative medicine to help the symptoms when they come on.    I would quit looking to the past in envy of who you once were and wanting to be that way again. Look forward and address how you want to cope with the situation at hand and how you want your future to look, without suicide as the solution.    Just remember, you were, are and will be OK. Sometimes life throws you curveballs. When you feel bad, take a step back and recognize that the voices in your head are not you, they are just feelings. You are something much deeper and devine.    I wish you lots of luck with finding a solution to this. Don't feel alone, you aren't the only one. I promise.|`|a5a6137a3495c2ce47106a7509ca259eaa	Dial 911.

I don't have a heart condition - but I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder and mild case of being a hypochondriac.   It sucks I know. There were times when I honestly thought that my heart was going to beat so fast that eventually it would just stop. I remember lying in bed not being able to sleep because I was convinced that I would never wake up. It was the most horrible and terrifying time in my life. You need to get help. I can't tell you how much it has changed my life. First I went to my doctor and explained everything I'd been feeling - in great detail. He then wrote me up a prescription for Zoloft. It's time released and takes awhile to take full effect so off I went to a counselor. It's very important to find one you like. Having a sh*tty counselor can be awful and make things worse. But the bottom line is, STOP thinking about killing yourself. Seriously. It won't help a damn thing. Get to your doctor. Get to a therapist. Talk to someone.   If you ever need some one to just vent to - my e-mail is mgleigh@gmail.com|`|Skh7cmOKaa	1st of all pay no attention to the idiot above...someone that has never gone through anything life threatening would be the only person to say something so stupid. 2nd- Calm down. It's gonna be ok. You are making it worse on yourself and your heart every time you have these panic attacks. 3rd- Is there anything or anyone you love more than life? Not even yourself? If so then you've got something to live for. And finally, 4th -It could be worse. I am a single mother of 2 waiting to get the news from my Dr. whether I am gonna live or not! But I have kids that need me, they have noon else but me. If I die then what about them. If you killed yourself wouldn't you care about the ppl it would hurt. If I die sometime soon, I would be concerned about not just dying but what about the affects on my kids lives. So it's not all about u or me. Our choices affect everyone around us. If you are a believer-pray...It really works. It is the main thing that has kept me sane. Because I believe that everything is gonna work out. I'll pray for you. You never know what can happen!
wem5CpcPaa	I don't know if this will help, but 'they' have found out that sometimes the urge to drink is stronger if a person is lacking B vitamins or has a blood sugar problem.  So, sometimes the craving is just the body's way of filling a need.  One study took two groups of mice.  They put out two dishes for each group - one had beer, the other water.  When they pulled the B vitamins out of one group, they started drinking the beer instead of the water.  When the researchers put the B vitamins back into the diet, the mice just stopped the beer and went back to water.|`|X9v50pmCaa	ASK GOD IN YOUR HEAD OR OUT LOUD TO DELIVERY YOU FROM DRINKING.

4yrqRS4qaa	under a search for emotional abuse was the following:  a definition of verbal abuse  - You understand their feelings, but they never attempt to understand yours;  - They dismiss your difficulties or issues as unimportant or an overreaction;  - They do not listen to you;  - They always put their needs before yours;  - They expect you to perform tasks that you find unpleasant or humiliating;  - You "walk on eggshells" in an effort not to upset them;  - They ignore logic and prefer amateur theatrics in order to remain the centre of attention;  - Instead manipulate you into feeling guilty for things that have nothing to do with you;  - They attempt to destroy any outside support you receive by belittling the people/ service/practice in an attempt to retain exclusive control over your emotions;  - They never take responsibility for hurting others;  - They blame everyone and everything else for any unfortunate events in their lives;  - They perceive themselves as martyrs or victims and constantly expect preferential treatment.  at is emotional abuse?    There is no universally accepted definition of emotional abuse. Like other forms of violence in relationships, emotional abuse is based on power and control. The following are widely recognized as forms of emotional abuse:  rejecting  - refusing to acknowledge a person's presence, value or worth; communicating to a person that she or he is useless or inferior; devaluing her/his thoughts and feelings.  degrading  - insulting, ridiculing, name calling, imitating and infantilizing; behaviour which diminishes the identity, dignity and self-worth of the person. Examples: yelling, swearing, publicly humiliating or labelling a person as stupid; mimicking a person's disability; treating a senior as if she or he cannot make decisions.  terrorizing  - inducing terror or extreme fear in a person; coercing by intimidation; placing or threatening to place a person in an unfit or dangerous environment.  isolating  - physical confinement; restricting normal contact with others; limiting freedom within a person's own environment.corrupting/exploiting  - socializing a person into accepting ideas or behaviour which oppose legal standards; using a person for advantage or profit  denying emotional responsiveness  - failing to provide care in a sensitive and responsive manner; being detached and uninvolved; interacting only when necessary; ignoring a person's mental health needs.|`|d9c8yRacaa	I am so sorry that this happened to you - nobody has the right to make you feel like you are worthless. It makes me so angry to hear that yet another  bright woman with good friends and interesting hobbies is being abused by a petty, insecure and jealous excuse for a man. You were abused I'm afraid, but I know you have the strength in you to move on and not let it happen again. You are a good person and do not deserve this awful treatment. My father did the same to my mother over the course of thirty-five years, I grew up watching her become more and more meek and frail as he bullied and belittled her until the point where she began to believe his lies. He did this because he feared losing her, he always knew he wasn't good enough for her and though he never hit her, this emotional torture was his way of making her feel that nobody else would want her and that she should be so greatful he took pity on her. Good luck and know how valuable and amazing you are.|`|AA11839888	yes
P9NSk1NCaa	Put a damp hot/warm compress to your nose and keep it their for about 5 minutes. Then get a STERILIZED sewing needle ( run it throw boiling water or put rubbing alcohol on it ) and lightly prick the pimple head. Get some tissue/toilet paper, rap it around your index fingers and LIGHTLY apply pressure to the sides of pimple. DO NOT SQUEEZE SUPER HARD. if you got the puss out and you see blood coming out or apple juice liquid STOP and put your acne meds on it or rubbing alcohol. if no puss comes out leave it alone and put some rubbing alcohol or benzoyal peroxide on that bad boy and leave it alone. the pimple will come to a head eventually and you can do the process over again.     hope this helps :)    **if you squeeze too hard you'll end up with a nice gross scab on your nose, like me for instance ;( which could lead to infection and scarring**|`|0pqZsSRYaa	pop it, or cleanse with hot water and lay a hot wash cloth on it to make it very clean. all you can do is wait... this stuff happens|`|kQufRZDjaa	you can try putting toothpaste on it .

You will see much more tragic things then some dude falling out at a bus stop.|`|efRk0NO9aa	Aw I'm so sorry.  It's okay, I know how that is... one time when I was like six, I witnessed a guy being pinned to the ground and the guy over him was holding a gun forcing him to give all of his money.  That's not a very easy sight to see either.  And I've seen someone faint.    It's not easy, but you just need to be happy that you're thinking about that guy because you're someone that actually CARES.  It's not a pleasant thing to think about it, but you won't be invisioning this forever.    But just go out with your friends or fam. and do something that you like to do to get your mind off of it and every time this does come to mind, listen to music on high-volume (loud music doesn't encourage your brain to think very well...) and think about something that makes you happy... like shopping, a fun sport, or get out a pen and paper and make goals.  And focus on accomplishing it/them.  A goal doesn't have to be a life-long journey kind of thing, but something simple like... clean your room by Saturday, or plan a slumber party, or just about anything.     But works best for me is reading.  Nothing can help get your mind off of something like a good book.  Seriously.  :)   If you haven't read Twilight (or any of the Twilight series, you should.  They're amazing and addicting).     Eat ice cream or frozen yogurt.  Many doctors tell people who's family is dying to eat frozen vanilla yogurt b/c something about it "soothes" the mind and calms you and helps get your mind off w.e. may be bothering you.  :)  Or eat your favorite treat of any kind whenever you think about it.    Chatrooms work great.  Every time I'm sad I usually snuggle up and go on ICQ Christian chatrooms to talk to nice people who want to help me with my problems, or ICQ Teen chatroom is a fave, too.  :)    If anything else at all, email me!  I'm always here. :)    Xx|`|rbUXsgDBaa	Talk to your mom, school counselor or someone else you trust. The more you talk about it the better it will get.|`|AA10796077	Since it is probably your first experience seeing something like that, it's understandable that you would be shaken.  It just says that you're a caring human being.  Perhaps the man survived thanks to your 911 call.  If he didn't, at least you and your mom tried to help.  You did a good deed and I'm sure that his wife is grateful that someone cared enough to try and help.  Be proud of yourself for having a conscience.  Your feelings are very normal.  Time will help you get the images out of your head.  It is important to talk to someone about your feelings and not keep them inside.  Take care.

wem5CpcPaa	I had four boys who would get this once in a while.  First, there are things you can take, like garlic, echinacea, vitamins - to help when the sore throat starts.   The point is to help your body fight the bug that it's picked up.       I found a cure for pink eye that always worked.  I know it sounds strange, but I've come to learn that herbs are an amazing thing.     Get some chamomile tea.  Heat up a pan or kettle of water til it boils.  Wrap the tea bag in a thin-ish piece of cotton.  Hold it to the outside of the pan til it warms up (but not so hot that it would burn you.)  Put the tea bag on your eye and it draws the pink eye out.   That worked every time for each of my four sons.       Also, lots of fluids and fruit to help your body get over the infection.       I'm sure there's lots more you could find on the web.  Just type in something like 'natural cures for pink eye' or call a health food store.       Lastly, the advantage to using more natural ways of getting over  being sick is that it helps your immune system get stronger.  Taking drugs has a place, but no matter what the reason, they are still a stress on the system.       Hang in there!  Remember that pink eye is contagious!

You will need to find out what caused the reaction and get a bracelet or something telling what you are allergic to, so if it happens again, the Dr.s will know.  The same thing happened to me when I took an Advil.  I am allergic to all medications in the nsaid class.  Had surgery and I always ask what they are going to give me.

MHg9JhEKaa	Yes, you could be pregnant. You can ovulate straight after your period.    Your question isn't that clear. Do you mean you STARTED your last period on 31st Dec, or was that the day you had sex, and therefore your last period started say 5 - 7 days before that?? Which if so then technically you are already late. How many days is your normal cycle though?    Take a test my love.|`|4ceE9TFcaa	usually you are not fertile the day after your period.  it may be only late because you fear you might be.    your cycle is very sensitive, any stress or anger or cold can delay it.  if you are one week late, then you should worry.    btw, either get on the pill, or use a condom. that would be reasonable.|`|0eq7uuyLaa	If you had sex, then yes, there is a possibility that you are pregnant, no matter what the other circumstances are. Generally a woman's cycle is 28 days, but that can change drastically from one to another.

E4iUcYEjaa	No.  All spicy food does to your body is make you sweat which "cools down" your body.  That is why in most hot and humid countries (such as Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam, etc.) they have very spicy foods - it's to cool their bodies from the heat by producing more sweat.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	I think it does, as your body has to work hard to process spicy foods, including the sweating.|`|spNcZAidaa	no it dosent..unless the burning on your tongue makes you run like hell then maybe yes...otherwise no.|`|AA11596130	NOOOOOOOOO....|`|3p7552z3aa	i think vinegar is better for that effect! personally thinking.

Disclaimer, i don't know if this has been proven.|`|uhvKLEgGaa	I think if it did then they won't be any need for diet pills and so on, and it is normal to feel hot after eating something spicy especially if you body isn't used to it.|`|pDzvLrJNaa	just because you eat spicy food doesnt mean ur gonna loose weight... if that were true then that would be the easiest weight loss program ever!!
ZjhQ6PL8aa	Depends on how serious it is and what's causing it.  If it's a mild cause you can use antacids, Tagament, Zantac and so on.  If it's a stomach acid issue they have meds like Prilosec and Prevacid.  If helicobacter pylori is the cause they have meds for that too.  All though it often takes a combination of things and can require multiple rounds due to it's resilience.  If you have gastritis or suspect you have it then you need to talk to your doctor so it can be properly treated.    If your looking for good sleep aid Ambien is really good even Lunesta works well.|`|0REHUZugaa	Sleeping may help you feel a little better, try Valerian drops.

KppM3VzAaa	You don't want to lose weight you need to bulk up.    Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).

zGf8kBEkaa	My daughter has strabismus (she's 2) and she has had surgery for it, but she also still needs to wear glasses.    My understanding is that if glasses fully correct the turn, then surgery is a bad idea, it can actually over correct and cause your eyes to turn outward (wall-eyed).  In that case, what your doctor told you is exactly what I have heard, that as you get older, your prescription will lessen, at the same time that your eye muscle gets stronger.  I do know people who had strabismus and wore glasses as kids, their eyes do not turn in now except when they are very tired.    If your glasses correct your eyes turning now, then contacts with the same prescription should also keep your eyes from turning in.      The reason we had the surgery done for my daughter is that her eyes were turning in even with her glasses.  The glasses helped, but not completely.  So for her, the surgery was necessary, but she still needs glasses, and I would not have put her through the surgery had it not been necessary.    There's a good Yahoo group for people with strabismus called Eyes Apart.  There are a lot of people who have had the surgery, some with good results and some with not good results and plenty who never did have surgery.  They're very good at answering questions.  You might want to post your question there.  http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Eye...    Best of luck.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	its possible for your eye muscle to recover- it could be a year or even less until the muscle is normal.  Do you wear glasses to correct your vision or just to stop your eye from turning in- if you don't have any vision problems then its possible to throw away your glasses for good.

NlulTfFOaa	I've gotten strep every year of my life since early elementary school. It really does suck.    Unfortunately, without the proper antibiotics there's nothing you can do besides waiting it out. It's an infection and not something you can cure by drinking tea or something. It is dangerous in the long run, but waiting it out one time shouldn't do you much of any harm. Just don't let it happen again.     Consider taking Ibuprofen for it's anti-inflammatory effects. It should help calm down your throat. Perhaps even some super ice-cold ice water to numb. Do not use any throat sprays- those can damage and burn up your throat even more.    If you have a resource for a doctor, I suggest seeing one.You'll receive a very simple pink liquid or pill and it will go away quickly :)|`|Rz6KwQjKaa	Ok, do you have swollen glands, they are right under your jaw, just before your ears?

Food is more powerful than any prescription weight loss pills, because the Food that you eat can either make you THIN or FAT.   You don't get fat because of a lack of exercising, that's a myth.  You get fat because you don't eat the right foods at the right intervals each day.    Your body is like an "engine" and it only needs certain foods at certain intervals each day, and if you don't eat the right foods at the right times then it won't burn those calories -- and you'll wind up storing those calories as fat tissue. Eat at least 3 times a day.      It's not really any more complicated than that, and the way to start losing weight has nothing to do with starving yourself or jogging.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|xItSR9Z7aa	Believe it or not, squats and lunges are very good for losing belly fat.  Situps and crunches will tone, but won't get rid of the fat.  Also, get lots of cardio in there.

If you want to eat pizza, you should try to make your own. Use whole wheat crust instead of white, and that way you can control what you put on the pizza, too. You also can't choose where you lose weight in your body, but you can definately try to tone your stomach by doing exercises that work your core. I think that it's just a rumor that Britney Spears got her toned stomach with 200 situps a day, it takes much more than that to really get a flat stomach. It could help, though, but definately don't count on it being your only source. It's usually just a waste of time.  I think your best bet is working out your core (ask the instructors at the gym which machines are best for this) and definately cutting out carbohydrates. Some are okay, but eating them is probably what's keeping you from losing weight.

Certain forms of exercise will just tone up the muscles such as Sit-ups etc the best way for you to loose it is my watching your Calorie intake daily and sticking to a nutritional diet.    Obviously you want to reduce the amount of fat intake, and you should stick to a good Carbohydrate intake avoiding biscuits/sugar etc and stick to wholegrain foods eg brown bread instead of white and rice, nuts etc.    Eating to much Carbohydrates will slow down your metabolism as it cant metabolise to much carbohydrates at once, so the excess just gets stored as fat.    You should also drink plenty of water which is the most important thing and the main bulk of your meals should vegetables along with a small amount of protein.    As for excessive you should do a fair amount of cardio workouts such as swimming, running or cycling which are all very easy to do and If you mix them up with afew bodyweight excersizes such as lunges, squats, et. It will benift you more ;) Not a quick or easy processes I'm afraid|`|xItSR9Z7aa	The best way to get rid of flab is cardio.

My dentist told me when I was having oral surgery that weed was no big deal to have in your system, it just meant that in cases of long term use they need to slightly up the dose of anesthesia to get the desired effect.|`|MIltW9p5aa	Yes. it will stays in your body for 3months i think.    badluck|`|WNB4Vojsaa	they will smoke a bone with you, then fix your nose|`|xWaCmo4Taa	no|`|JjoLo4e1aa	5 days ?? probably not, and it wouldnt matter anyways|`|aY6EjDwjaa	you didnt state that question well, did ya?

If you think you have an anxiety disorder, you should seek information and treatment right away.    This booklet will   describe the symptoms of anxiety disorders,   explain the role of research in understanding the causes of these conditions,   describe effective treatments,   help you learn how to obtain treatment and work with a doctor or therapist, and s  uggest ways to make treatment more effective.  The following anxiety disorders are discussed in this brochure:   panic disorder,   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),   social phobia (or social anxiety disorder),   specific phobias, and   generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).  http://www.athealth.com/consumer/disorde...|`|6NZeItMAaa	Identy what is causing you that anxiety and Try to have positive reactions to stress    You can choose to react to stress in a negative way or in a positive way, it is all up to you. This is the only choice that you have when it comes to most stress.    Think about a stressful situation that you have in your life at the moment. If you are like most people, you will not have to think for long as most of us have some sort of stress in our lives. Think carefully about the stress. Write it on a piece of paper.    Is this stress something that you can control? Is it something that you can do without? If the stress is something that you can eliminate from your life, why are you not ridding yourself of this stress?    If the stress is something that you cannot control, how are you reacting to the stress? Are your reactions negative or positive?    By choosing to react to your stress in a positive manner, you can not only control your stress, but you will end up eliminating the stress.    Choose to react to your stress in a positive manner instead of in a negative way and you will achieve positive results. Choose to react in a negative manner and you will begin down the route of self destruction.     Proper diet, exercising, yoga, meditating, massage therapy, aromatherapy, talking your problems out with a therapist or friend and so on.|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively).     The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the http://1-800-therapist.com/ & http://www.metanoia.org/choose/ websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.    Practice one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm-too-fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by. Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past. Because many people can't access/afford professional therapy, I include the EFT, and EMDR variant for them to try, free of charge (professional is best). Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy is generally available in most areas, but EMDR (see section 33) may well be worth trying, and is becoming more widespread.|`|QKXrDnvDaa	Have you spoken to your Dr about it?  I'm the same, and although I still get moments of impending doom, where I feel like everything's too much and I can't cope, they are less common and I hardly ever get panic attacks any more.  There are different solutions for everyone, but I found that some medication gave me enough space from the anxiety to work on what's causing the anxiety and panic.    I suggest you see a GP and/or a counsellor to try to find a way out.  It's not the easiest process, but I feel so much better now than I did a while ago, and I promise there is a light at the end of the tunnel, bleak as you may feel right now.    I hope you start to feel better soon, however you decide to proceed.|`|3JUKOGOvaa	the posts here seem very informing.

HEAVEN:  Did you know that there is a place called Heaven?  Heaven is a perfect place.    The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass. The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.   And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.  And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by dayand there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.  -Revelation    In order to get into Heaven you must believe in God and obey God.  The only way to get to God is by Jesus.  This is because God came to this world in human form as Jesus to die as an ultimate sacrifice for our wrong doings to save you and I from going to Hell.

PGkR813Jaa	Insomnia is one of the common side effects. And other sleep disturbances.    Unfortunately increased tiredness is not a side effect.    If you are suffering from insomnia already before being put on Celexa then your Doctor hasn't done enough research in to the right medication for you.    You would be better off with something like Avanza which has sedation as a common side effect.  So killing two birds with one stone as the insomnia can add to the depression.  With something like Avanza, your depression is being tackled so is the sleeplessness.    This is what my son's Doctor did for him.  He is now very happy with his depressionw ell controlled.

I had my vein harvested from my lower leg as it was an emergency situation and I had absolutely not one single problem with my leg.      As your surgery is planned you will probably have your mammary vein harvested for the bypass.  I dont think you will even be able to tell or feel that it has been moved.    I imagine you will be in hospital around 5-7 days.  I was in 12 days., I had a bypass,valve replacement and aneurysm repair as well as a major complication. They will get you up and walking the very next day. You will be surprised at how much you are able to do.

It helps in building muscle tissue. More muscles burn more fat and increases your metabolism. Calories from the protein rich foods are much harder for the body to breakdown and process.Protein is a good appetite suppressant.     --------- Spices-Spices boosts metabolism, suppresses appetite, reduce fat absorption and adds taste to your meal. Replace butter or mayonnaise with garlic, chili, mustard, ginger. Saute vegetables and chicken in hot sauce as opposed to oil.    --Eat smaller, more frequent meals--      --Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with brown rice and whole-grain products--    --Drink more water--Water helps to lose weight.

uFRIsdC7aa	Symptoms of Depression  Do you have symptoms of clinical depression? Sure, most of us feel sad, lonely, or depressed at times. And feeling depressed is a normal reaction to loss, life's struggles, or an injured self-esteem. But when these feelings become overwhelming and last for long periods of time, they can keep you from leading a normal, active life. That's when it's time to seek medical help.  http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/de...|`|6NZeItMAaa	Identifying Stressors    Many of us may feel stressed out in our daily lives without knowing why. As many people are on medication due to anxiety and depression, it is obvious that many of us are under a great deal of stress. While medications to alleviate the symptoms of stress can help, they are merely a mask. The real problem is the stressful situation that we are enduring, either in our minds or in reality.    While some of us can point to different stress factors that have occurred recently in our lives, others have absolutely no idea why we are stressed. In some cases, the original stressor can be something that happened in our childhood. If you are feeling stressed out sit down with a pen and paper and try to identify the cause of your stress. In most cases, it will be more than one different problem that is causing you stress. Try to pinpoint the source of your stress by writing down everything that is worrying you.    Keep a journal of your day to day activities and how you feel periodically throughout the day. Think about the different people with whom you interact with during the course of the day and how you feel about each interaction.    Once you have identified the source of your stress, you can then make a determination on how you can handle the stress that is affecting your daily life. Chances are that your stress factors will be one of the following:      ? A personal relationship;  ? Money;  ? Job situation;  ? Health concerns.    Some of the stressors you will be able to control, others you will not be able to do anything about. But in order to help yourself, you are going to have to know what you are up against when it comes to the cause of your stress.|`|B24W8w43aa	Depression is unmistakable. You know if you have it.

I'm not sure how old you are but I want you to know that you can get over this. This can end and it doesn't have to end in death. I want you to make some changes. Instead of thinking sad depressing thoughts, I want you to just make the best of what the situation at hand is. Earlier this morning my cousin (him and I are really close) pushed me up against a wall and told me to go somewhere else. Instead of crying about it, I thought that it might give him a chance to see that he was being a dink. Maybe this is a lession he will learn from. Maybe there are some changes you will have to make. I'll end by saying that this life is a great gift. I don't want you to cut yourself. I also don't want you to die. Think of the experiences you might miss out on. By being depressed you might also think that those experiences aren't that great. They are. To me at least. Please don't end up killing yourself. Hopefully I helped.|`|6MRcqskIaa	Most mental health disorders are evaluated with extreme caution. There is no way of knowing exactly what you might have - without knowing what exactly might have made you feel this way. For instance what you describe as self-harming (cut yourself) can fit a  several mental health conditions. Psychiatrist need to hear your story first (what lead you to have severe sadness and lead you to cutting yourself) to make a proper diagnoses. That is why, it is important for you to see a GP or a psychiatrist. Please remember most mental health conditions that  can cause sadness have a cause, either that be trauma related like death of a love one through tragic circumstances and/or divorce, or something tragic might have happened to you, etc.   Unfortunately, that means there is no simple answer to your question For instance, here are some of the other types disorders that could fit your symptoms - post traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder.   In knowing that you might have a mental health condition is only going to help you understand your symptoms it is not going to repair it. Getting treatment ( either through medication and/or psychotherapy) is your best options. To me, the only way to help yourself is to seek help.|`|X9v50pmCaa	DO NOT KILL YOURSELF!!!!!!

WzWaz9hvaa	When I cry HARD, my face becomes very hot, red and sore. The only thing I can do to relieve it is to have a cool shower and let the water run over my face. Then take some decent pain killers and go to sleep. After a really hard cry, that's a good idea anyhow.   I don't know why you're crying but I hope you will feel better soon! Whoever or whatever hurt you probably wasn't worth it, and crying is incredibly good for you when something really upsets you, nothing worse than bottling it all up. *e-hug*|`|y39iNwFjaa	If simple remedies like cold water and a simple moisturiser doesn't help - see your doctor as it may be an allergic reaction to something.|`|AA11591747	Could be an allergy: you need help from professionals|`|8uE7gfwHaa	Go to the hospital now!|`|m5aenb6qaa	You may be having some sort of allergic reaction. seek for a medical help and try to remember what touched your face or what have you eaten before your face became swollen.
fk9AvB25aa	Not really since there is still a small risk of spreading herpes even if a condom is used. Condoms only cover so much of the genitals, if there is some thing going on out side of where the condom covers then you still have a small risk of getting herpes.  Just watch your symptoms and make sure there are no signs of an out break before you have sex. Herpes is LESS contagious when there is no out break, but there is still a small chance of passing herpes on this is even further reduced if you using some kind of suppressive therapy regularly.|`|xb0qmxxWaa	yes, you can take valtrex which will reduce the amount the virus spreads about 50% and wear condoms which will knock it down a certain percentage too (i forgot how much)...     however valtrex has only been studied in hsv-2 infected partners, its has not had any studies to see if it works in genital hsv-1 because hsv-1 occurs and spreads so rarely.    I've talked with alot of people who'm have never in their relationships spread their herpes to their partners and they've been together for decades.|`|AA11648899	I'd not risk it... that's for dag sure!

The only thing u can do is take valtrex & wear condoms each & every time especially if you are having sex with a non infected partner!    Now if your having sex with a person that already has herpes type 2 then u dont have to take valtrex! I would still wear a condom in case the other infected person has some other type of strain of the type 2 herpes!     If u have any questions im here please message me or email me.|`|bIuPngqIaa	unfortunatly no, herpes can be passed even without and signs or symptoms of an outbreak.    always use a condom, and if you want to you can get tested every so often to see if you got the virus.    i was unfortunat i always use condoms and i got it, so be careful...|`|5HeNp5tjaa	good question|`|LWM8LPzvaa	Use condoms or latex barriers every time you have sex,Avoid oral/Genitle contact.
AA11414373	Neem oil helps to reduce itching and in India it is used with tumeric as a home remedy.  In US elimite is used which is a pesticide and put on over night. There are mild soaps like dove sensitive or health food ones for itching. Watch out for hot water as that aggravates rashes. Be sure to wash clothes in hottest temperature and add a little borax.
