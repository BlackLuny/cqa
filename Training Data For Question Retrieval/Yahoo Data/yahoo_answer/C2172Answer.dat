En cuanto a muchos dicen que es Metal Gear Solid y saga yo digo que es bueno pero no mas en la historia y su forma de juego.

PES est comme un bon vin, il ne s'apprecie que si tu es capable d'y percevoirs ses infimes subtilits.  Je suis un fan absolu de jeux video et je joue depuis les annes 80 vois tu, et je peux t'assurer que des jeux de foot j'en ai connus un paquet!  Kick OFF - Sensible soccer - Virtua striker - Fifa 1er du nom - sur mon 386 SX 40 ouf ! ISS - et enfin PES.  Jamais aucun jeu de foot ne m'a autant satisfait que celui ci et ds la 1ere version.  PES se veut raliste, il est donc assez hrmetique au depart car relativement frustrant au contraire d'un FIFA qui se veut fun et jouable des les 5 premieres minutes.  Mais que de satisfactions si tu perssites un  tant soit peu, car PES demande de la prseverance, et de la pateiente pour en tirer tout la quintessence par la suite.

La jouabilit tend de plus en plus vers le ralisme et si le kepper fait des bourdes , c'est tout simplement parce konami a favoris le jeu offensif mais toutes les quipes ne sont pas nulles en dfense.  moi aussi , j'ai eu du mal au dbut malgr mes heures de jeu sur pes5, j'ai chang 3 fois d'quipe en masters-league avant de trouver une qui me plaisait..aprs une bonne dose de persvrance, je suis enfin champion , je monte en premire division et ai report la coupe...  bref ce jeu est le meilleure opus avec tout ce qui fait que le jeu est bon, graphisme, jouabilit, difficulte...realisme...  maintenant si tu prfres les jeux de foot arcade, revend le tant que tu sauras en tirer un bon prix et achte fifa2007...  ;-)|`|8c97d8ae161e63c49db704aaf3602540aa	moi aussi je suis pas d'accord je suis une amatrice de pro et la premire fois que j'ai joue pro6 j'ai remarque un manque de prcision au niveau des passes et un manque terrible des couffrants mais finalement je me suis adapte et je me sens beaucoup mieux c'est beaucoup plus raliste et plus intressant essaye d'aimer le jeu et tu vas sentir la diffrence

No, because it shouldn't have launched when it did with that pathetic line-up of games.  It's been over a month, and I think there's been only 2 new games.  That's pathetic.

Exchange the game from the store it was bought and try to see if it does the same thing.  If it does, than it's your Xbox.|`|AA10101806	DON'T PANIC!!! STEP AWAY FROM THE 360.    seriously.  I have had a 360 from the beginning.  It is a flawed system.  Here are some ideas to help you:    1.  Check the location of the 360.  It needs to be in a place with good air flow so it won't get too hot.    2.  Buy a "intercooler fan".  Costs about $25 and it keeps the system cool like a computer.    3.  Check your other games to make sure if its the system or the game.    3.  If those things fail, take it back to the store.  If you don't have a reciept, call Microsoft and they will send you a box to ship it to a repair center.  That process takes about 2 weeks from start to finish.

The when the game is installed on your computer you will need to click on the icon on your desktop, and then the game will start, so you play.    Their is also another way to play game. You can go to gaming website on the web, and you can play for free of cost. However those games aren't the best because time is not spent on them like a game at the store was.

I'd say even though I am HUGE PS2 fan - Xbox 360.   Reasons are:  1)  Most games are similar and Microsoft has license for a lot of games so there are a lot of XBOX only games  2)  Xbox has been out longer - therefore more games - cheaper price  3)  Xbox has been out longer - therefore easily available  4)  Xbox has been out longer - WAY cheaper price  5)  Graphics are comparable.    That being said...I still love Playstation and I'd still love a PS3 way more than a xbox any day.  Plus, I hate the weird remote.  It's huge!

Tiene un sonido muy discreto (como de tablero de madera).     Tiene una opcin para ver el ltimo movimiento, en el caso de que ests haciendo otras cosas en internet es muy til esa opcin.    Adems lleva en una pantalla a un lado del tablero todos los movimientos de la partida, en el caso de que haya sido una partida especialmente buena y quieras volver a pensarla.    Y tiene un registro para cada jugador sobre las ltimas diez partidas.    Puedes jugar, o puedes observar partidas de otros jugadores. Como hay gente que juega muy bien, esta opcin te sirve.    Adems hay siempre mucha gente, de todo el mundo, de todos los niveles. Hay chat pero en realidad son pocas las personas que entran a chatear, la gente ms bien va a jugar.     En la pgina tienen muchos juegos: go, go-mocku, sudoku, billar, etc etc etc... tienen 3 modalidades de ajedrez: el normal, el blitz, y otro que no le entiendo. Todos super seguros, yo llevo a?os jugando ah y nunca he tenido problemas de virus o adware (hasta hace poco pero por otra cosa).     Depende de tu computadora, pero puede tardar en bajarse la primera vez. No es un software, no lo instalas. Creo que funciona con java.     No tienes que registrarte (puedes jugar como invitado), pero es recomendable hacerlo, y es rpido. No ms de cinco minutos. No te piden ms datos que un mail.    Conozco a gente que ha tenido problemas con el juego porque el juego lo "tira" muy seguido y se queda con la partida a medias. A m eso me ha pasado muy rara vez, la verdad, y creo que eso tambin depende ms de tu computadora.     En fin, si no tienes problemas con registrarte, ni tienes una compu lenta, te lo recomiendo ampliamente. Mucha gente que conozco que juega bien y mucho, juega ah (casual, sin ponernos de acuerdo).     Es completamente gratis, aunque existe la opcin de suscribirse por 9 dlares al a?o... una cosa por el estilo. Yo no lo hago, me funciona bien as.    Y tambin he escuchado que mucha gente que le encanta el ajedrez juega en yahoo, pero yo nunca me he metido a juagr ajedrez a yahoo, ah s no te puedo decir qu onda.

70233e2f2461ffbb9d4ee7546d392f76aa	I believe the game you are looking for is called "50 Cent: Bulletproof"  50 Cent had a movie named "Get Rich or Die Tryin'"  The movie came out on November 9th 2005, and this game came out on November 17th, so I'm guessing you mixed it up.    In anycase, The 50 Cent game is only available on PS2, XBOX and PSP.  So, if the 360 can play it through backwards compatibility, then I suppose it can work.|`|LCeegcYGaa	no but there was a game released on the ps2 by 50 cent called bulletproof.

H os jogos de RPG do tipo comunidade que est?o se tornando bastante populares na web, tem o Gaia Online (que eu j joguei e  muito legalzinho), o ClubPenguin, PuzzlePirates, acho que o Habbo tambm segue este estilo; em todos esses jogos voc cria seu avatar e joga alguns joguinhos do tipo pescaria em flash para ganhar dinheiro e poder personaliz-los mais.  Tem outros que s?o browser based mesmo. Tibia  bastante popular, bitefight e knightfight (que s?o jogos que n?o exigem muito do jogador, voc pode s deixar seu personagem fazendo miss?es) s?o ok; tambm tem o Travian, um jogo de estratgia online massivo, o PokemonCrater (que  cheio de publicidade) e o meu favorito, FallenSword (favorito porque adoro a interatividade do seu sistema de guildas, porque adoro os mecanismos bem pensados de leil?o e de loteria; o jogo  10).  . D uma olhada em alguns jogos da lista, visita as pginas dos desenvolvedores, v umas screenshots do jogo, l um pouco sobre ele, depois tenta saber o tamanho do jogo e se n?o  pesado para voc.

LCeegcYGaa	Wow havent played that game in awhile. If my memory serves me right you have to beat the best posted time for than specific class of car. Try gamefaqs.com they should have a great walkthrough for that game that will be able to explain it better than me. Good luck.
LCeegcYGaa	Its been awhile since i played but if i remember correctly you can pound the mud with your shovel and it might produce money or something else. Also when your miner finds something digging the item will come out of those mounds of mud.|`|H6hrRJmVaa	try pinping out the diggerling, it should attract more pinatas?  im not sure i only played tha game once.

AA10922520	In short, no  Sephiroth was a clone made from the cells of Jenova (which is why Kadaj and the others refer to her as "Mother" in advent children as they are clones as well).  He was an attempt at a super soldier as were cloud and Zack, but he was the only successful soldier created.

So, H freak prob is the sperm donor and he also injected Lucretia w/ JENOVA cells|`|eRXoxf19aa	Not exactly Sephiroth was born due to an experiment that Shinra was doing. His mother was Lucrecia, the same woman that Vincent was in love with. She was Hojo's assistant, they fused Jenova cells on the baby as part of the experiment. Sephiroth is basically part human and the other half is basically due to the Jenova cells.|`|4kdLtO9Yaa	I havent played that game in a long time, and what Im about to say might very well be 100% wrong, but from what I remember...

GAybqLiSaa	First of all, you must get the MACH BIKE, go to Kinsetsu City (Mauville City) and exchange it if you have the acro bike which is the one that can make tricks. You really need this MACH BIKE to get through the cracked floors inside SECRET TOWER (SKY PILLAR).    This pokemon is in level 70. You need a master ball to catch it because its a ***** to catch with Ultra Balls. Go to Kinagi Town (Pacifidlog Town), SURF to the east and look for a hidden island with a cave. get in side the cave in order to reach the tower, after you went through the cave you will make it to the tower. Get your *** inside the tower.    -First Floor-  Go upstairs    -Second Floor-  The floor is cracked, use the FAST BIKE, make it to the stairs.    -Third Floor-  The stairs on the middle are blocked, use the ones on the right.    -Fourth Floor-  The hardest floor and you need the FAST BIKE to get through but There's no door to get in on that floor. Do you remember those blocked stairs on the third floor? Well, you must fall in one of the holes in order to keep going. I know its a ***** but its worth it, I spent more that ? hour trying to get in the right hole XP.    -Third floor, AGAIN!-  Take the stairs in the middle.    -Fourth Floor-  UP!!!!    -Fifth Floor-  Keep Going up!    -Sixth and last Floor-  Here's the Legendary pokemon you wanted, prepare to fight and have your MASTER BALL ready. Rekkazu (RAYQUAZA) is at level 70 and it will be a pain in the *** to capture it with an ULTRA BALLl (^^; ). He's a Dragon/Flying pokemon and its attacks are OUTRAGE/FLY/REST/EXTREMESPEED|`|PZ5qZ9Wzaa	Well, you'll need the Mach Bike to get through them...|`|tH56I1I0aa	Use the mach bike, and after every floor roughly remember how the floor below was set up in case you fall,  its important you keep your speed and to be as fluent as possible when moving along the floor|`|b008rib6aa	use mach bike and remeber to gain speed before going through the cracks. when going through, try not to stop anywhere and keep going. do not crash into something or you will fall into the next crack when you move your bike again. for the 2 floor of cracks, to get past the last few cracks on top, go al the way to the side till there are 2 cracks in a row. go to the second crack and quickly turn to the other crack before it. let yourself drop and go up the staircases. you will finally reach rayquaza|`|vZ3Pm4Foaa	you need the mach bike you cant stop and you make sharp turns. when you fall look where you neeed to fall. then go up and find where that is. then ride do that big sharp turn and bam. you are prob there. hope this helped.

id0Kdg7gaa	Soon after the PSP was released, hackers began to discover exploits in the PSP that could be used to run unsigned code on the device. Sony released version 1.51 of the PSP firmware in May 2005 to plug the holes that hackers were using to gain access to the device.[1] On June 15, 2005 the hackers distributed the cracked code of the PSP on the internet. Hackers refused to apply updates which would render their hacks unusable so Sony attempted to convince users that there was a benefit to upgrading by including new features in the firmware updates, such as a web browser, and not just security patches to plug the vulnerabilities. BusinessWeek dubbed this the "carrot-and-stick" approach.[2]    In August 2005 Sony released version 2.0 of the firmware which included the web browser, file compatibility updates and other features.[3] Hackers and other homebrew enthusiasts then encountered the first trojan for the PSP. Symantec called this trojan "Trojan.PSPBrick". Users attempting to downgrade their PSP using this software instead found that it was rendered inoperable as this software deleted important system files.[4] Over the course of 2005 Sony released six different versions of the firmware and hackers typically responded to it by downgrading to avoid the new security updates.[2]    In Mid-2006, after several months of problems in defeating the PSP's firmware a file was posted online which allowed new PSPs running firmware version 2.6 to downgrade to 1.5 so they could then be hacked using older methods. This reportedly caused more buzz in the community than any recent official offerings for the device.[5]    One of the drawbacks of downgrading the PSP is that new legitimate media may require the presence of a new firmware edition. A hacker by the name of Dark Alex had released a custom firmware called "Dark Alex's Open Edition firmware" which opens the firmware but allows users to use the existing feature set of the current edition. Sony quickly patched the firmware again, continuing the carrot-and-stick game with the hackers and users.[6] In 2006 Sony released six updates to the system firmware and in 2007 they released another six updates.      [edit] Motivation for homebrew  Hackers have stated that the motivation for unlocking the PSP has nothing to do with piracy, but allowing individuals full access to the products they've purchased and the freedom to do what they want with the item as well as the interest in exploring something unknown.[7][2] Fanjita, a member of the hacker group "N00bz!", stated,    "Everyone has the right to do what they want with their own hardware. Piracy does upset me, and because what we are doing opens the way to piracy it's harder to justify it morally. But our stance on piracy is clear, and we hope to be role models. Sony have never been in touch with me, so I am confident that what we are doing is legal."[6]    Additional features added including the ability to share music, print photos, watch videos from streaming sites such as YouTube, and run additional video formats originally unsupported by the device[2]     [edit] Sony's position  Sony has told the media that any issues resulting from running modified code on the device would void the warranty.[1][2] They have also stated that the problem is not with homebrew but piracy.[6] However their constant firmware updates are seen as attempts to hamper homebrew development.[8] According to Phillip Torrone from Make Magazine, this hampering could do the attempts to curb piracy more harm than good.[7]    "I think the really smart companies should release their products to the alpha geeks for six months and let the alpha geeks play around with them. It seems to me they'd save a lot of money on R&D, and they'd come out with much more solid products."    However, Sony has also said that, when questioned about homebrew game support, Jack Tretton replied with,    "I think that is something that is in the works. We certainly see some of the stuff that has been done via homebrew, and it's incredibly creative. And I think we'd like to try and tap into that a little bit more."

IxNQwrKYaa	I have tried an Ouija board once in my life, and I asked the spirits of the board one question: "Where do you get your power of divination?" The answer I received was enough to make me swear off of Ouija boards forever, and I haven't touched one since. To answer your question, in short: Yes, Virginia, the Ouija board does work, and trust me, you don't want it to be working anywhere near you.    There is a popular belief that an Ouija board has some inherent power, or that spirits live inside the board or planchette. This is not correct. The Ouija board is simply a board with letters, numbers, a few words, and copyright and/or patent information, and the planchette is a small inert device that has been designed to move easily across the board. There is nothing magic or mysterious about the board or planchette themselves, and the mere presence of such devices will not cause paranormal events to occur.    The board's power comes from the calling forth of spirits. The participant(s) get(s) the attention of these spirits and ask(s) them questions, whereupon the spirits respond by moving the planchette around on the board. Many people believe a person can call forth the spirit of someone who has passed on, or some other specific entity, but this has never been proven, to my knowledge. The spirit(s) who are summoned will often not have any singular identity at all.    Those spirits who do have identities will usually be vague, evasive or misleading about their names. This is because knowing their names can give the experienced summoner power over the spirits themselves, and the spirits can then be forced to do things they don't want to do. This is very undesirable to the spirits, of course, who want to keep their liberty and freedom intact.    The spirits who are summoned in this way are never good ones. Good spirits will not respond to this type of summoning. Sometimes the spirits who are summoned are neutral or mischievous, and will often simply give random answers to participants' questions.    Other spirits may be more powerful than these, and may actually have limited knowledge they may impart. However, these spirits are nearly always malevolent, and when summoned they may decide to take residence in the room or household where they are summoned. Sometimes they will even take residence in the participants themselves! Once they have taken residence, they can manifest themselves in our world of reality in real and very frightening, and in some cases very destructive, ways.    Depending on the power of these malevolent beings, one may be able to drive them out in a variety of ways. These spirits are very legalistic, however, and some of them may have the power to take up permanent residence in the room, household or person they have elected to haunt.    These spirits can only be gotten rid of by identifying the source of their right to be wherever they are, renouncing this right, and flooding the host with good spirits. They can then be forced to flee. Very powerful evil spirits may be difficult to exorcise even in this manner, but it is the only manner that has been proven to be successful.    Keep in mind that this is the way you get rid of the malevolent spirits once you have them. You cannot prevent their permanent residence by any means, whether by religious icons, garlic, holy water, or whatever, because the actual calling forth of spirits is what gives them the right to stay. The calling of the spirits will override any preventive measures you could use to prevent their permanent residence.    If you do call forth spirits to manipulate objects in the real world and divulge information, you are asking for trouble. My advice is, DON'T! No information received in this way is worth the potential risk of possession by evil spirits. Many lives have been completely destroyed in this way. Please, don't let this happen to you. If you are tempted to use divination devices to call forth spirits, get rid of them. Your life will be much better for it. - LJS|`|3Ke1Xccuaa	I've tried one before, it didn't work for me but i still believe it does work.     http://www.graveaddiction.com/wforum/    cool site for things like that.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	There's nothing mystical about them. They "work" because people unconciously move their hands.|`|7kPvV8EXaa	I like what Mark said, If you are not a believer stay away.  I am not sure what he was referring to.  I think there are bad things out there and that I am protected fro them because I am a believer, in God.  So He has that covered, he has beaten them before and even Lucifer had to ask permission before he could fiddle with the Believers.     Yet at the same time we have the power of choice.  I choose my company I keep and that company doesnt include anything which would please the enemy.  (similar to the Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis)  I dont go places that can do me no good and only can hurt me.  Satan doesnt have any Real answers so that is the last place I would turn for guidance.     I trust that I am protected, all the time, always.  I am never alone. And that I am not in control of anything.  All I can do in a day is what I can do within my abilities.  The captain of the boat sets the course.  I gave up trying to be Captain about 9 years ago.  All I could do when I thought I was in control was to wreck the ship.  Since all I am now is a first mate, life has been outstanding.      Sorry if it sounds preachy.  I am a believer and believe that evil exists and I avoid it when I can.|`|cb2c2458dfe4b006160ae0fba8b821ccaa	I have not tried it but I recommend you do not. Why? Because it deals with forces unknown. If you are not a believer in this then its pointless anyway and if you are a believer then stay clear.  Either way Ouija boards are not to be messed with.
Kh4p4gPXaa	This varies,  I usually count down (though if you are sure theres no cheating,  it isnt really necessary in a home game),   "Wash"  (mix them in a pile),   gather them up,   riffle,  cut three piles,   riffle,  cut and deal.   There is no real "official" way.    You always deal to the left of you first,  then clockwise around the table (the dealer himself gets the last card).   Small blind is the first player to the dealers left,  big blind is the next player.  After the flop is down,  action starts with the player to the immediate left of the dealer (small blind).  This will chance as the button moves one player (or seat) clockwise each turn.      The dealer button,  if there is an assigned dealer,  is used solely to determine bet order.    To decide initially,  deal one card face up to everyone,  high card is dealer (deal a 2nd card as a tiebreaker if necessary)|`|t5gs1Qsuaa	It sounds like a home game and most people aren't super fussy about how many times you shuffle. If you are just the dealer, you should be able to just cut the cards yourself, but if you are playing and the dealer position comes to you the cards should already be cut to you (or offer the cut behind you) The dealer chip generally starts in front of the person who drew the Ace (or highest card) You deal clockwise and shouldn't need the small blind and big blind chips if you guys aren't newbies. The dealer chip serves as the place holder for small and big blind. So dealer button, to your left, small blind, two spots to your left, big blind. Good luck! Its a fun game!

The truck in front of the Indiana Jones Ride, is the original truck from the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark, when Indy is being pulled by the truck in the desert.    There are still stands that have blended into the park that used to be t e-ticket booths.  Ex.

On September 26, 2008, the latest SSDF rating list was released,   with Deep Rybka 3 in first place in the rankings with a rating of 3238.    2008: Deep Rybka 3 2GB Q6600 2.4 GHz (3238).  Rybka is significantly stronger  about 60% faster    when used in 64-bit mode than in 32-bit mode.    Captain Kirk played chess vs Mr Spock three times in the Star Trek series.  Kirk won every game. Mr Spock had otherwise only played against a computer.

6N3yjlXhaa	The answer is in the details.  Some shirts have a lot and some are very simple.    The ability of the person doing the construction to understand directions and use a sewing machine also factor in.    A tailor could do this in a day, day in a half.    By hand takes twice as long.|`|fVAApgMXaa	With a pattern already known to fit, and the fabric already cut, I can run a Tee-shirt in about 30 minutes.  But, I've made many-many-many and I have a both a serger & a chain stitch machine.  On simple straight sew machine, zig zag finish, doing it for your first time, with help, expect a flat constructed, tee-shirt to be at least four hours, but I'd give yourself more time.  Unless you're doing a throw-away type of disposable costume that one might rapidly hand-baste, I can't imagine a tee-shirt being worth sewing by hand.   There is fine hand sewing for garment construction, and yes, it's still done, but the committment takes many-many hours (think 40 to 200 hours+ the high end there was an cotton Edwardian sheath that would have taken me 10 hours by careful machine sewing, but was 200+ by hand).  Well worth it for heirloom-type garments, but for a tee, quicker and more durable to use a machine.    Dress shirts with fitting and the wonderful details that go into them can be six to 20 hours or more  of fitting and detailed fine sewing. A lot of this can be simplified - which costumers do when they prepare to make a production run of a great many costumes, but all of this is relative.  I have a favorite blouse with raglan sleeves, one-piece cuff, and fold back (simple) collar that after cutting, works up in about an hour including (only 3) buttonholes & finishing seams by serger, mitering corners & topstitching hems - fits me like a glove.  But - getting that pattern-fit perfection took greater than 40 hours; well worth the time.  Good luck to you.

If you play with one, then you'll know, but since you don't, I'll give you a breakdown.    Why TeleDAD Decks Are Good...    1. Draw, Draw, Draw...  The deck is flushed with DARK Monsters, thus, making it easy to search through with Allure of Darkness. Other cards aid in the searching and drawing of cards like Elemental Hero Stratos for Destiny Hero - Malicious which is discarded for Destiny Draw. Emergency Teleport and Reinforcement of the Army complete this set to search for E-Hero Statos, Special Summon Krebons and or Psychic Commander, and many other various moves.    2. Control Your Deck...  Armageddon Knight combines with Plaguespreader Zombie and Necro Gardna to protect yourself from attacks in addition to topdecking Destiny Draw or Allure of Darkness for Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude's effects. In turn, you can get out a Level 8 Synchro Monster with Plaguespreader Zombie and D-Hero - Malicious while also drawing two free cards the next turn.    3. Control Your Graveyard...  Dark Armed Dragon may have a strict requirement, but with the ability to remove monsters from the game with D-Hero Malicious, and Allure of Darkness making you remove from play instead of sending to the Graveyard, your Graveyard can easily have exactly three DARK monsters. With DAD's effect, his summoning comes with at least three cards being gone from your opponent's side of the field.    4. Miscellaneous Cards...  These cards are all the Traps in the Deck, in addition to Dark Grepher, which controls your Graveyard and thins your Deck. The Traps are all about protection, Phoenix Wing Wind Blast protects against Stardust Dragon; Mirror Force protects against any other monster; Solemn Judgment protects from anything being destroyed or countered; Threatening Roar stops your opponent while you have an empty field; and Trap Dustshoot controls your opponent's hand.    The way the deck is built makes it powerful, and ability to pull off three or sometimes even four Synchro Summons in a turn is unheard of. To make it even more simple, TeleDAD takes the best traits of each card in its deck and abuses it tenfold.    I cannot say the Deck will be the same come March, considering the release of Crimson Crisis will be upon us in addition to a revised Forbidden/Limited List. But for now, TeleDAD is the prime deck against any other deck, except for itself, where anything goes. Although TeleDAD might get weakened, the time to try to beat it is running out as well.|`|gwy4cp7Saa	they dont anymore its lights worn,blacwing and core chimera now

WVU3ACIIaa	Honestly it all depends. There are many variables when playing the bakugan game. First is the ability to roll the bakugan and get it to open up on a gate card ( especially the card you wanted it to open on ) If your better at that then your opponent you can win the game without a battle even taking place and bakugan not mattering at all.    Next if it does come to battles it all depends on the cards as some cards are better for certain attributes so while your opponent may be higher if the cards favor you then yours can win. Also it can depend on the ability cards you can play. You can always play ability cards to make you bakugan higher so thats a possibility as well.    Finally there are gate cards and ability cards that allow Lowest printed G-Power bakugan to win so having a high g-power will make you lose.    There are many variables and it all depends. Play with the ones you like the most or the ones that you have the best cards to help you with.    Check out http://www.BakuganBuzz.com|`|8VFKvFqPaa	its OK

Six Flags used to own two parks in Ohio, but they have since sold them. One was in Aurora, Ohio. It is near Cleveland. It has been called: Geauga Lake & Wildwater Kingdom (2005 to 2007), Geauga Lake (2004), Six Flags Worlds of Adventure (2001 to 2003), Six Flags Ohio (2000), and Geauga Lake (1888 to 1999) according to RCDB.com    The park was sold to someone else a few years ago and all of the roller coasters were taken down. Some went to other parks around the country and others were destroyed. The park is now only a water-park with only water rides. Prices and the lower attendance caused this decision to only keep the water-park. This was partly due to the fact that Cedar Point is close by and causes fierce competition. RCDB.com has all the past roller coasters for the park.    Six Flags also used to own Wyandot Lake in Powell, Ohio. They sold it for the same reason. The park is part of the Columbus Zoo which is now called Jungle Jack's Landing. They have one roller coaster and always have since the 1950s. This was also found on RCDB.com    Hope this helps. Six Flags will not be buying a park in Ohio, but they are building a park in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It will be called Dubailand which is part of a major park incorporating several different parks built by different companies. It will open in 2015.

f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	I play lots of games with cards of tiny sizes, and I have no problem using the standard riffle shuffle (minus the cascade effect at the end - I just push the two halves together).     If the deck has lots of cards, I may split it into a couple smaller decks and shuffle those separately, then split each of the smaller decks in half and shuffle the first half of the two decks together, the second half of the two decks together, and then stack everything up into one deck.|`|IxNQwrKYaa	The best way I know of to shuffle small card decks is to spread them out on a smooth, flat surface and lightly shuffle them around like you would do with dominoes. Make sure the surface you are using is clean, dry, smooth, and large enough to spread the entire deck out thinly. Don't use a card table or any other surface that doesn't let the cards slip around freely. Move the individual cards around like dominoes for a couple of minutes, then gather them together, stacking them randomly. Do this before you play the game so you won't have to do it just before playing. You should be able to take a randomly arranged deck of cards out of the box and immediately start playing with them. - LJS|`|ASL5nrSBaa	split them in to 2 pile (around equal hight) place them on somthing hard, palce them about 1  inch away from each other, now bring on the left deck of cards bring the closest right hand corner to about half way in between the other deck but the opiset way so now the to corners shoud be touching each other now get your 2 thumbs to each corner that is touching the other corner (1 thumb under each corner but not compeatly under just ur nail) (this is the hard part to explane) now put the rest of your fingers ontop of the deck now u pull ur thumb up the corner (u need to do both decks at the same time) while pushing down slightly to keep the deck from moving and if u do it correctly u can get the 2 deck to mix  (sorry if i was confusing)|`|AA11968008	Long John Silver's suggestion, called "the Granny Shuffle," works for me. BTW, a company called Fantasy Flight makes individual sleeves for cards that tiny. Check with your neighborhood hobby store or online to see if they are in stock.

WFzt2fHOaa	you will need the D&D players handbook :)|`|kIqq7yIAaa	first find an experienced player to assist you with character creation    then make copies of your blank sheet for everyone playing    roll 4d6's take the best three numbers and add them together  your DM will tell you if he allows rerolls  roll 6 times then place your totals into the 6 "stat" boxes on the far left   listed as STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA, depending on what your chosen class needs for minimum stats the higher the better  look in the PHB for the bonus score chart in the first section  find your score and note the number place in the second set of boxes next to your stats these are your modifiers     the feats are a tricky thing to work out so finding an experienced player is very helpful  saving throws are based on your modifiers for the requisite save  armor class is 10+DEX mod+armor+shield+ any misc items like spells and magic items your total is your armor class    gear is up to you  magic items are up to your DM

vkriSHGYaa	No bleach wouldn't help.  Remove the exhaust from the RC and submerge it in soapy water.  Leave it in there for a couple of hours.  Then scrub it with a toothbrush.  Denatured alcohol is a way cheaper alternative then using Nitro Blaster or Nitro Cleaner.  It can be bought at at any hardware store, Walmart or Menards should have a good price.  Rust on an aluminum pipe is not easily formed, maybe you need a new pipe if it is that bad.  Make sure you dry the pipe good, maybe re-attach it to the engine and run some exhaust through it to finish up the cleaning process.

l6lh6fT8aa	First off, let's get this straight. There is no such thing as an interrupt. That is an outdated, outmoded, obsolete card type.    Also, you can't wait until your opponent starts looking at your hand to use the Naya Charm - you can't cast anything while an effect (Duress) is resolving. But there's no problem with casting it in response to his Duress, while Duress is still on the stack.|`|PTYHS1LDaa	Yes, that is one of the abilities that card can do....did he think otherwise?|`|JqF72lzkaa	yes you can|`|fPavekfeaa	To clarify playing any spell in mtg works like this.    Spell is announced and the cost is paid and targets are chosen.    Any other players are given a chance to respond to the spell being announced. The player to the right of the person who announced the spell gets first priority and gets first crack at responding. You continue to the right in this fashion until everyone has had a chance to respond. When your priority comes up you can play your Naya charm.    After you announce Naya charm all other players have a chance to respond to it. In the same fashion as distress IE player to the right responds first and so on.    You repeat the announce, pay cost, choose target, other players respond until no one has a response for the most recently played spell or ability.    Spells are then resolved in first in last out order. IE the spell played first  (distress) is the last spell to resolve. Assuming you play your Naya charm and no on else responds your Naya Charm resolves, then distress resolves.    Once a spell begins resolving however no one may take any action until it has fully resolved. IE once distress begins to resolve no one can play anything else until your opponent chooses a card to discard from your hand.

Have fun.!!|`|154dzJ1Faa	(Someone just asked this question the other day)  Here are some good sites for basic mittens.  They are quite easy to do, with a bit of a challenge (which makes it interesting) and you really should try them.  I like to do them in the round, but one of these also shows you how to do them flat, and then seam them up one side (I don't like doing seams!):    http://knitting.about.com/gi/dynamic/off...  http://knitwithkt.blogspot.com/2007/11/b...  http://www.p2designs.com/pdfs/MittsCuffU...  http://www.freevintageknitting.com/mitte...  After mittens, try the fingerless gloves... and then socks!
XEKvJzGaaa	You need a micro soldering iron, solder, non magnetic tweezers, very high grit sandpaper (600-2000), polishing rouge and the cheapest Dremel tool plus muslin buffs 1 1/4 in in diameter for the tool and rouge. First go to danaruth.com. She makes jewelery and sells the supplies. See if you can talk to her. She is very nice. You might also go to ofrei.com, julesborel.com, or esslinger.com. You'll have to get the Dremel at a hardware store. Good luck.

q0EwnYroaa	this is where you need to go for big range of free patterns  http://crochetpatterncentral.com/directo...  here is the crochet abbreviation link to understand the patterns better  http://www.crochetpatterncentral.com/dir...    and for yarn you might want to look at http://www.lionbrand.com ,  http://www.yarnmarket.com , http://www.joann.com  or other websites or local yarn/craft store.  the first rabbit amigurumi reminds me of the pattern amigurumi panda pattern on lionbrand website. it was made by using fun fur yarn.  http://www.lionbrand.com/patterns/70587A...|`|AA11142732	Try joining a crafting community such as Craftster.org or Ravelry.com.  I think the cone pattern is free.  You can probably find the bear free as well as it is a pretty common one out there.  A few popular books are:  Amigurumi World: Seriously Cute Crochet  Mr. Funky's Super Crochet Wonderful  Amigurumi!: Super Happy Crochet Cute    Crochetme.com had an article about this some time ago.  You can also look on ebay.com for books but I highly recommend learning your basic stitches, joining in the round, increasing, decreasing, and the magic loop cast on as well as how to join pieces because these are basic in amigurumi.  Learning to read crochet charts will let you be able to get japanese books because they use charts in their crochet.  Hope this helps!!    Oh, for the yarn, I would look around hobby lobby if you have one close because they have a good selection of novelty yarns.  Look on the site for coupons!  This week is the 25% off, 40% coupons regularly.  Micheal's has a coupon as well but I am not familiar with their yarn selection because it's been a long time since I've been in one.|`|jfHIUJJlaa	Here is a website I found that has free patterns.

7XGa9zcdaa	You would stop his attack, but you can only attack on your turn.  Since you lose control of the creature at the end of his turn, you would need to play the card on your turn, before your attack phase.|`|l6lh6fT8aa	No. You can only attack on your turn.

I'm almost 17 now and even though I don't play with them, I CAN'T let them go because I know I'd hate myself for doing so. I'm also like "worried" that if I was to give them away, people wouldn't take care of them like I have for so long, so yeah, I'm not letting go  ;)    (BTW, I still buy them--I'm an amateur collector and I like customizing, my 4th grade teacher was hardcore, she collected them too and at that time she had like 200+ dolls--she was in her forties)|`|mjhPteRYaa	Hmm..

JtcVwK2Caa	I'm not sure the answer is straight forward as it depends on a number of factors - how long you want to store things, the physical environment around your magazines (heat and humidity destroys paper and it depends how much acid is present in the paper of the magazines and the storage boxes themselves - do look for acid free storage boxes), the bulk of your magazines etc. I found a site dedicated to helping people look after their family archives for you though:    http://www.naa.gov.au/services/family-hi...    I hope a search of this site leads you to the answers you want.     Another thought is to ask at your local library. They may have an archivist there, or books on the subject?     Here's a page I wrote about the importance of having acid free, lignan free and buffered paper in scrapbooking, as it may help you understand the nature of paper and why long-term storage of items can be a challenge:    http://www.papercraftcentral.com/acid-fr...

Vu3J4e0saa	Why not use bamboo - it's already hollow|`|kIqq7yIAaa	depending on how thick the wand's shaft is you can drill out the center near the back end where it's wider  insert said fur and plug with a wood cap  ask a friend if they can help drill out the core with a small drill bit  as this will not compromise the wand's strength    as for putting the fur inside you might need to make a small funnel  to dump the fur into then poke the fur into the hole with a small thin bladed screwdriver  another option is to drop a small amount of clear resin or apoxy and roll the fur into a small stick form then just glue inside and cap as before

TestTrak isn't that great but ride it anyway.  Magic Kingdom: Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Pirates, Haunted Mansion, ride everything at Magic Kingdom because they are all classic.  Hollywood Studios: Tower of terror is the best ride at Disneyworld. Skip the Indiana Jones show because it's stupid. I was too scared to Ride the Aerosmith Coaster.  Animal Kingdom: Expedition Everest, Kali Rapids.    basically ride as much as you can and make sure to see the Honey I Shrunk... show.|`|WUBZrmXzaa	I like Space Mountain, but the PhilharMagic 3-D movie is also really cool.

It has touring plans that tell you where to go, when to go, and what can be missed if your time is limited. My family and I went in July '08, a very busy time of year. We never waited more than 15 minutes for any ride! We saw others families with the same book and they all said the same thing: "These plans work!"

LItIiiHKaa	This all depends on how good a player you are and I wouldn't pretend to guess that :)  The only way to really know is to play the game and then do the math.  If the play is very poor and you aren't then you should do real well.    King Cobra Poker  http://kingcobrapoker.com|`|lyHyIRdFaa	The other answer is really stupid. No offense. But to your question. If you are good, and expect to maybe play optimally 20 % of the hands you see, you can expect to maybe win half of those, if other players are no good. However, this can be a problem, as poor players often play hands they shouldnt, hands you would never expect them to have and then suck out. But assuming you win half of the hands you play, maybe more if the players are bad, then you can expect about $50 in a pretty meager pot, and at about 27 hands per hour, maybe....$200. This is assuming you are not a poor player as well. Im no omaha expert, but with split hi/lo pots and all, you can expect to have to divy some of the winnings with another player. This is assuming you play tight/aggressive, and only play good starting hands. If you play looser, then maybe you could win more depending on how loose the other players are.|`|pLMrvOOMaa	25 30 an hour is too much, you will play 50 hands per hour. you should play an average of 8 but don't consider the amount of times you enter consider the cards. In fixed limit you should be looser but if your too lose the amount of hands you enter may not be covered by the earnings. you should consider earnings in months not in hours but per hour about 20 dollars it is a limit game theres no need to cash out. on more tight games u'll make less money|`|PCpC4iS1aa	nothing cuz the house always wins

hosyXVKFaa	Have him refer to you as something outrageous for an entire day (or longer) like every time he mentions you or talks to you he has to refer to you as "Her Highness, My Queen, My Reason for Being" (or, in the spirit of the competition, something more like: "The Grand Bowling Champion, My Ultimate Trouncer").    Make him stand 5 feet behind you at all times for a specified period.  When you're walking down the street and even when you're standing still.  Then mess with him, try to close the gap and make him skirt around you to keep the distance or spin so that he has to move to stay behind you.  Remind him of his loss and the bet if he doesn't maintain the gap and stay BEHIND you.    Inspired by a Doctor Who episode (Utopia), for a set period of time, every time he speaks he must say a specific word at the beginning of talking and at the end.  In the Dr Who, the woman had to preface with Chan and end with Tho.  So something like "Nice to meet you" would actually be "Chan Nice to meet you Tho".

It sounds hard but its SO easy! You just need cardstock and cross stitch floss, a punch needle, and things you want to add. The designs are made for cards so not only are you doing a craft that is quick and easy (for those of us who like instant gratification) you can sell, share, give these cards for ANY occasion. You'll never have to buy another card again and they are fun because you can add and do anything to them. I like to add different paper colors under it and shape them with ridged scissors.    Here is a link a book with patterns. Basically you photocopy the picture, punch the holes into a piece of card stock, follow the pattern to make the image, and glue to other card and and embellishments. Its easy!    http://www.amazon.com/Basics-Embroidery-...|`|Mw8F9Boaaa	Learn to play chess and/or Pox Nora.

Advertise for members in the local paper,on supermarket bulletin boards,in church newsletters and even printed flyers you pass out door to door. Ask for people of different talents and when they call to join, tell them to think of a project they would like to teach the group.

So are games.|`|BlEpojebaa	are the pepsi armbands stilll usable after 3pm?|`|AA11615216	the official website is down right now but I did find a sister site that had some of the answers to your questions:    Will there be ride-all-you-can-ride Pepsi Armbands available this year?  A: Yes. Pepsi Armband days are February 8,10,15,17 or 18 for unlimited rides on those  days only. The armbands are only $20 when bought in advance by the deadline before   the Fair begins.  On opening day of the Fair after 3 PM, buy an Aquafina Armband for only    $15 each armband available at a Fair Midway ticket booth.  During Pepsi Armband days,    the price is $25 each armband.  A gate admission ticket is required to enter the Fair before   you can use any armband.  All rides require multiple ride tickets be purchased or use an   armband to enjoy the ride. Pepsi Armbands are good for a one-time use only that day.  To come back on another armband day will require an additional armband purchase for  each Armband day.  A few rides may not accept the Pepsi Armband and will require ride  tickets be purchased to enjoy the ride.   Some height, health or other restrictions may apply      http://gothere.com/Florida/Tampa/Fairgro...

lB7uvA73aa	check glow plug, unscrew from top of engine and when you have it out put the igniter to it to see if it glows bright, if it doesnt that is your problem. Next, make sure you prime it. Next, try starting it with glow plug a little loose, i do this when having trouble and it starts better, just make sure to tighten it after it starts. Also try starting with throttle ope a little bit|`|vkriSHGYaa	I agree with the previous answer on first checking if the glow plug works and make sure that the first coils light, not just the back ones.  It may be a little gummed up, just prime it up good.  If the there's not enough fuel in the carb try putting a drop or two of fuel in the carb.  Check fuel lines for leaks.  Never heard of loosening the glow plug, if anything make sure its tightened to the touch (but not too tight as it may strip).  Check if your not missing the copper o-ring for the glow plug.  If it's still cold outside, make sure you warm up your engine before starting it.  If all fails, a rebuild may be in order, but use it as a last resort especially if you haven't done one yet.  Any more questions feel free to email/IM me.
XJlD2kPsaa	Okay, party hats, you can't make them, they were dropped in the 2001 chirstmas event there's no way you can get one without buying one. You might as well just work for the money. And bots are now gonna get you banned i think it was to the IP level now. Where you can't even make another account on the computer that was traced. Never use bots. For money i suggest doing rune crafting, mining rune essence, making steel bars, killing hill giants  for free to play players. For members there are many more things but im not gonna say them cause there's just too many..|`|Q9aufTNvaa	Party hats, or phats for short, are obtained by opening christmas crackers, dropped during the 2001 Christmas event. There are six different coloured partyhats, all with the same shape. When worn by a player they resemble a crown. Party hats have no stat bonuses. Because they are discontinued, they are very rare and much sought after. Partyhats can usually fetch between 80,000,000 and 340,000,000 coins when sold. These are currently the some of the most valuable objects in RuneScape. However, since the release of trade limits, party hats had significantly gone down in street value and are now used as junk to trade 3rd age armours.    Due to their high price, they have become recognized as a symbol of wealth in the game by players and Non-player characters alike.|`|r7gxrbqGaa	you can't make party hats. they're discontinued items so there's no way to get them other than buying them from another player. only one person that i know of figured out how to duplicate items and he got ip banned for it. there are no cheats for runescape, but you can buy gold for real money, if you decide to do that then i recommend using this site: http://www.sythe.org/showthread.php?t=37...|`|yyb5AERjaa	do not chat or hack on runescape it will get u banned but if u want to make money     spin flax into bow string      or      fish do not cook the fish keep them raw          sell ur stuff on the grand exchange      do not go to a site that says it is going to get u money because it is just gonna hack u

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	One can get all the state quarters colored. A lot are hand painted. They look nice but coin collectors consider them damaged coins. As for now they have little secondary market value but who knows what the future will bring. Back in the 1890's a lot of coin were enameled and had little collector value but that is not true today for they are kind of rare. I saw a set of colored state quarters in an oak frame and they were very impressive. They would make a great item to pass down in the family and just might be valuable in the future. Collect what you like that is the one fun thing of coin collecting. To collect to make money then you need to do some work and learn about coins. One can do both.|`|ZoAQiPanaa	You can look at it two ways. On one hand, will it be worth more if sold later as some sort of investment return. It probably won't be worth much, because, as one poster says, many collectors consider a colorized coin, "damaged goods".  On the other hand, what is the coin worth to you? I have coins in my collection that, from a resell point of view, are worthless. However, they represent a certain era that is dear to me. Therefore, to me, they are priceless.  I agree with the other poster. Put it away somewhere.

hFUD3K4Uaa	Yes, there is a monthly fee to play SWG. That fee is $15.74 USD. You have the option to pay monthly, quarterly, or yearly.    I have to ask which game you are referring to as the "base" disc. The original game is Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. The expansions are Jump to Lightspeed, Rage of the Wookies, and the Trials of Obi-Wan. However:  1. If you have the Starter Kit, you have Empire Divided and JTL  2. if you have the Total Experience, you get the first game, plus JTL and RotW.  3. if you have the Complete Online Adventure, you have all the game, plus the three expansions     As for professions, it is up to you. With the exception of the Trader professions, all professions (including Entertainer) can be combat professions. Everyone can be a Politician, so that shouldn't make a difference as to your base profession. When you start the game, follow the Legacy Quest. It will teach you a lot about the game and how to play and interact with people and items in the game. Game play is not really complicated, unless you decide to go into a Trader profession. The crafting system is quite complex, but it can be very rewarding as well.    In my opinion, Jedi is the best. However, I hate that Jedi is now a starting profession. It wasn;t that way in the beginning of the game, and people who were Jedi later had to do a lot of different quests and professions to become a Jedi. Commando is good, and so is Medic. You can be a full doctor (healing mostly) or a Combat Medic (healing and poisons)    You can't have a sub-profession anymore.|`|SBcxooLsaa	wau for star trek online to come out its way better!!!!! lookup trailers and go to website check it out

The different forms see different degrees of usage throughout the meta-game, some listed in one tier while the others rest in a different one. While Eevee is my favorite for its form, elegance and versatility, it comes at the cost of some of the more intricate evolutions in the game. Eevee evolves through three different means: Stone based, Happiness in relation to time of day and Location. Not everyone understands how to evolve Eevee into its various forms because of this.|`|GfadITyTaa	YES!!! you can and try to breed as many as possible cause there rare....i dont think the offspring would be able to evolve though
AA11615216	http://gothere.com/Florida/Tampa/Fairgro...    Q: Will there be ride-all-you-can-ride Pepsi Armbands available this year?  A: Yes. Pepsi Armband days are February 8,10,15,17 or 18 for unlimited rides on those  days only. The armbands are only $20 when bought in advance by the deadline before   the Fair begins.  On opening day of the Fair after 3 PM, buy an Aquafina Armband for only    $15 each armband available at a Fair Midway ticket booth.  During Pepsi Armband days,    the price is $25 each armband.  A gate admission ticket is required to enter the Fair before   you can use any armband.  All rides require multiple ride tickets be purchased or use an   armband to enjoy the ride. Pepsi Armbands are good for a one-time use only that day.  To come back on another armband day will require an additional armband purchase for  each Armband day.  A few rides may not accept the Pepsi Armband and will require ride  tickets be purchased to enjoy the ride.   Some height, health or other restrictions may apply.|`|4uJAmjckaa	btw, the answer above me is wrong. thats for last year's fair. :)

1uDsQdljaa	You need the following    1. an ethernet hub, the link i provided for you is one that available on best buy and also has the highest rating from other who have used it. You do not need that particular model im simply showing you what to look for. NOTE: You only need this if the two xboxs are a distance from one another such as one being down stairs and the other being upstairs      http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...                  2. 1 or 2  Ethernet cords (sometimes called system link cord) Depending on whether or not you need the ethernet hub. If you need a ethernet hub then you need 2 ethernet cords. If you dont need an ethernet cord and simply buy a long ethernet cord which is the cheaper way to go, but its up to you   These cord are available in a number of different lengths. 2feet, 6feet, 12feet, 25 feet. 50 feet, ect and it goes on. Just buy the one you need there available at nearly any electronic stores such as best buy, target, or gamestop/ebgames    Link to ethernet cable    http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...      Remember you may need 2 ethernet cables if you have the 2 xboxs at a distance.      Setup. Plug both xboxs into the ethernet hub, and simply go to system link on the game your playing and create your game and your done, have your friend or brother just click on the custom made game that is shown when he attempts to go into system link as well, it should be there as well as your name, name of the gametype ect.|`|5TGtanQeaa	All right there is a certain cord you need.

SzepLJubaa	It depends. However, I personally suggest being a warlock, rather than a hunter.    If you are a hunter you have to spend a lot of money to buy your pets food, but warlocks don't need to feed their demonic pets (or minions).    Warlocks also get free special mounts: Felsteed (Lvl 30) and Dreadsteed (Lvl 80), but hunters have to spend money on their basic mounts.    Hunters have to spend a lot of money to buy arrows/ammo for their ranged weapons, but warlocks use spells and wands, which do not require any projectile to buy.    Warlocks also have cooler looking pets ;-)    And, warlocks are very good at being a DPS (doing damage to monsters/ opposing faction) in raids and dungeons so most raid groups will want you, but to tell you the truth, not many people need hunters.    I suggest you go warlock, but it's up to you to decide. A warlock doesn't require as much gold to spend. Good luck =)|`|PkauhFMwaa	Warlock! They are amazing :D|`|cypKCMgXaa	I suggest hunter. trust me, I personally don't own a copy, but I play on my friends computer, and he likes to PvP with another friend.

With Hunters you have to manage your pets happiness and you need to feed him, but Warlocks just have demon servants. In both cases you have a pet that takes the damage for you while you kill the monster.

FY4cCjsOaa	There are two answers, depending on whether you just want to learn a solution system, or you want to understand the cube and work it out for yourself.    If you just want a solution system, there are many books. (It does take a whole book, but they're not very long ones.)    If you want to understand the underlying math, I recommend finding the Scientific American article on the cube. If you've got access to a library with back volumes, it was published in March, 1981 (and that's where and when I learned). It also appears in the book "Metamagical Themas" by Douglas R. Hofstadter.    First, a general strategy: I always solve the cube by first positioning the four edge pieces on the top side. (Not just getting the "cross" color right, but matching them to the correct adjacent sides, too.) Then I position the four corners on that side, then the edges adjacent to them (the ones between the top and bottom sides).    That leaves the bottom side. The most difficult move from there is to get the four corners in the right places (but not necessarily turned the right way). You can get those corners into the correct orientation, reposition the remaining four edges if necessary, and "flip" those edges as necessary to finish up.    Each stage of this requires more complex moves, because there's more of the cube at each stage that has to get returned to where it started. (By a "move" I mean a sequence of turns that gets you to some desired change, with minimum and controlled side effects.)    Some mathematical notions, learned from that article, follow.    The minimum change to the cube is a quarter turn of one side. If you label the four edges on that side A through B, you'll see that it's a four-way swap: A for B, B for C, C for D, D for A. If you could swap only two cubelets at a time, you could undo this in three such swaps. So if you could find a move that exchanges two edges, and restores the rest of the cube to where it was at the start of that move, you could undo the amount of scrambling done by one turn in three repetitions of that move.    But at the same time, the four corners are going through a similar four-way swap. So the total number of swaps on the cube, at any time, is actually even. However, it can be an even number of edge swaps and an even number of corner swaps, or it could be an odd number of each. That means that you might find it necessary to have a move that exchanges a pair of edges and another pair of corners; that's exactly the problem I often wind up solving at the beginning of tackling the last side.    Besides the number of two-way swaps on the cube, there are a couple of other state characteristics that don't involve any interrelationship between the edges and corners. These have to do with how many edges are "flipped" so the colors are opposite what you want them to be, and how many corners are "twisted." The number of flips is always even, and the total twist (counting a clockwise twist as 1/3 and a counter-clockwise twist as -1/3) always adds up to an integer. So you can have three corners twisted clockwise (and the rest not twisted), or you can have one twisted clockwise and another counter-clockwise (and the rest not twisted), but you can't have two twisted clockwise and the rest untwisted.    One quote from the article below, in source, addresses what mathemeticians call conjugation: embedding one sequence of moves in another to change the effect.    The article also hints at something called a monoflip, which works like this: Find a set of moves that flips one edge, but restores everything else just on that face to its original position. Then turn that face so a different edge is in that position, and run the same set of moves backward. Turn the face back, and you've flipped two edges, while the backward moves restored whatever crazy scrambling had happened to the rest of the cube in the middle. (That's an example of conjugation, too.)    I use monoflips, including one that works on two edges on the central "slice" instead of on the same face. I also use the same basic concept to untwist corners--a monotwist maneuver.    I've actually solved it once, forgotten the solution, and had to work out a new one (which turned out to be an improvement) from those mathematical principles. I try to keep in practice a bit now, so I don't have to do that again.|`|UaHZH9ifaa	cos some people are too cool for google....|`|vtYRw2yWaa	It's complicated, so you're better off seeing it for yourself.    http://www.sweetsearch.com/search.html?q...|`|TC4Tf3V2aa	Peel the stickers off and then stick them back on in the finished order!|`|qHaXWGL9aa	heres the best videos online XD (? learned to solve the 3x3 4x4 and 5x5 very fast using these     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o8Vdn0Le...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpwaTJiLX...

If you need more bonding than that, you might look into a high quality permanent "white glue" like the kinds called PVA or bookbinding glue (less watery than other glues and fairly strong) which are often sold at art supply stores --you might have to weight those while drying-- or try a "tacky" white glue.    Those are all intended for porous surfaces... superglue and rubber cement aren't necessarily good for porous surfaces like paper/cardstock/etc.      "Glue pens" come with various types of glue in them though, so it's hard to say much in general.      As mentioned, there are also tapes which are adhesive on both sides (often made for scrapbookers, etc.) that should work fine but would be more expensive than glue stick or other white glues.    HTH,    Diane B.|`|Vu3J4e0saa	If you can't find a glue to stick try double sided adhesive tape.  I usually find that a multipurpose glue works but you need to hold the flaps in place while they dry - I use those small pegs to hold it together or place something heavy on them till they are stuck - put a piece of plastic between the envelope and whatever you weigh it down with in case some of the glue escapes.|`|hehVTS9iaa	I have a glue that is called Lick and Stick. Non toxic. You put it on the envelope and let it dry and when you are ready to seal you just wet it and seal away. I think I bought it a few years ago at a scrap book store.   C.J. VENNE, inc.
