20070109092455AAnHgiw	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Gibt es wirklich gute lustige oder aufmunternde Bücher?	Ich lese sehr gerne und auch viel, aber meist Bücher die ernsthafte Themen behandeln, in denen es den Leuten seelisch Schlecht geht, oder jemand stirbt. (zB, Die unertr?gliche Leichtigkeit des Seins, Die Blume des Korans, der Menschliche Markel) Ich kenne auch ein paar lustige und fr?hliche Bücher, aber an diese sozialkritischen Dramen kommen die meiner Meinung einfach bei Weitem nicht dran.   Der Schreibstil ist meist nicht so gut, die Geschichte zu übertrieben...   Vielleicht liegt es auch einfach daran, dass wenn man ein fr?hliches, lustiges Buch zu emotional schreibt es keiner mehr ernst nimmt, w?hrend man bei einem traurigen Buch einfach in dem Buch versinken kann.   Gibt es wirklich fr?hliche und/oder lustige Bücher die auch gut sind? Also sowohl stilistisch, als auch fesselnd und und und?

Da tempo "Iron" ( il cavallo) non correva più, non solo, mangiava poco e non dava alcun segno di attività. Il fattore decise allora di chiamare il veterinario il quale, dopo averlo visitato, consigliò alcune pillole e disse che se nel giro di qualche giorno non si fosse alzato avrebbero dovuto abbatterlo. Il maiale "Jonh" , sentendo questo corse da Iron e gli urlò: " devi riprenderti, forza". Ma il cavallo non cambiò atteggiamento.    Il giorno seguente torna il veterinario, diede un'altra pillola al cavallo e ribadisce che se non si alza, il giorno seguente l'avrebbero abbattuto. Jonh sentendo questo corse da Iron : " devi alzarti! devi alzarti!! Altrimenti domani ti uccideranno!!!   Il cavallo allora si alzo e cominciò a correre e a saltare..   Il contadino pieno di gioia abbracciò il veterinario e disse: " Lei è un dottore stupendo, dobbiamo festeggiare... ammazziamo il maiale!!!!"

20090205144514AAAemYg	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Thinking About Buying a Leica... but which one and type?	I am thinking about buying a Leica. My wife and I are going to Europe in about a year's time and I want to treat myself to a great camera to capture some of the beautiful architecture, landscape, etc.       I am thinking about buying a Leica M8, however, I am concerned that it will become obsolete extremely quickly compared to a regular film camera. I am NOT a professional photographer and I do not mind digital cameras due to their convenience and ease of use, however, when spending this kind of money, I want something that I can use for a long time. The last thing I want is a cellphone camera to have more megapixels than my Leica in 10 years.... which will probably happen.      What are your thoughts? Which Leica to buy?

I'm told I have talent? well I want to know what you think. this is a recent short story rough draft, btw it's true.         I awake from my dream, why is it so hot? Must be warming up. 2:45am I need to get back to bed, I close my eyes. 3:08pm dead time. creeek… creeek… creeek…Footsteps? No… can’t be. Yes, it is. No, I’m dreaming. Can’t be I’m I awake, this is real. Creeek… creeek… creeek…. Louder. Go to sleep this isn’t real, you’re dreaming, no, but it’s real. Creeek… creeek… creek… my blood flushes out of my face turning it white. My palms sweating, squeezing my eyes tight, this can’t be real, but it is. What was once my worst nightmare has suddenly become reality? How? I try to sleep but I can’t. ALONE. AWAKE. SCARED. Why? Sweating in my bed, in disbelief. 5:30am good, almost morning. At 6:00am I can turn on the lights. Suddenly I feel more safe… I’m tired. My eyelids are heavy; I’m just going to rest 30 minutes. Then I … drift.

20090205150016AAxZGzR	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	Looking for someone to illustrate my book.?	I am currently writing a book on a 'dimension' that is filled with magic, mythical creatures and those kinds of things. The twist however is that it's based in what could be the future, with buses flying overseas at 4000km per minute. What I really need however, is someone good at drawing to illustrate my book. Although the book isn't complete, there are already some pictures I would like done and I keep coming up with more. Don't worry if you've never illustrated a book before, as I have never written a book before myself. Sorry, but so far I'm not going to pay and illustrator, but should the book be successful, I am happy to discuss a reasonable split on the profits.      The illustrator has to be open minded, as what I call a 'bus' isn't the big yellow banana looking thing we have around today. I am not too picky, as long as the description I give is followed. If you want, try draw the following and put it on flickr or some other image hosting site:      The Gryphon she pointed at had large blue eyes that coolly stared straight into him, an entirely black body, long thin tail that lashed around like a snake and a very muscular build. It’s colour seemed to shimmer into dark blues and purples, creating an eerie presence.      Best picture wins, but if you don't have time to draw one, just say so and describe your drawings and If no other people draw better, I'll have a look at what you can do. Feel free to draw something else or put up something you've done before but this picture would be preferable.   Thanks! Note: Here's your chance to have your name on the front of a book, so take it or leave it!

20090205150927AAEiHnT	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Can anyone learn to control their body and dance well?	I've never been able to dance, the problem has always been my ability to control body movement... I've always been in awe of people who can control their body so well. I guess dancing to me could be compared to someone trying to use their toes to play the piano - they'd likely end up mashing the keys with their foot.    My friend has offered to teach me how to dance to club/hiphop to music, and I'm wondering if it's even possible for me to develop the motor skills to dance properly - maybe if you're not born with it you're effectively hopeless. I remember learning about this in school, something about the Somatic Nervous System, kinda wished I payed more attention in class, lol.    Anyway, can you train your brain and nervous system to control body movements more finely?

They are always described as hard as marble and when they are ripped apart they are stone inside?  Is that right?  they are solid? so they can never bleed?  Also, they can't cry tears (no bodily fluids) but they still produce sperm that can make a human pregnant (in their solid stone, fluidless bodies)?  How the heck would the male vampires get aroused then?  I'm not trying to pick apart all the nitty-gritty details - I did enjoy the series (except breaking dawn).

20090205153356AA9bITF	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is the place of humans on this planet?	I feel battled by this question. We are born to a family not of our choosing, we live life with the delusion of having some sort of control among it, making decisions and such but in the end nothing seems to change. Our lifetimes seems like a joke compared to that of the environment that surrounds us. Life is the same huge bubble of mystery as it was 10 000 years ago, and all of our efforts seem to just scratch the surface. Humans living today are physically the same as the ones that lived in caves.      We have shaped the nature to our benefit, formed various forms of government, got intellectual enough to form a global economy. Just because we evolved on this piece of rock, just because we were relatively stronger among other 1 billion species, does that make us the king of the forest? If so, that should come with the responsibility to protect the other 1 billion inhabitants does it not?      We sometimes imagine being somehow more privileged than the other person, sometimes simply by the difference in the contents of ones wallet, sometimes by the looks, sometimes by the ability to handle things differently. But, in the end the day is 24 hours for everybody, everyone has 2 eyes, 23 chromosomes from each parent etc.. Both the one in that fancy office makin important phone calls and the one busy with his cows. My point is everyone deserves things like a good education, healthy conditions to live daily life, an opportunity to make a positive impact on human future etc, there seems to be enough space for everybody but there's some sort of (im)balance with the inequalities. Why?      I think everyone has problems of their own. We may imagine the grass is greener on the other side, but maybe the other sees the same thing in us. The deal is to find a driving force strong enough to help find our way thru the system and live without regrets. What is your opinion of a driving force as such to pursue with the remainder of ones life?
