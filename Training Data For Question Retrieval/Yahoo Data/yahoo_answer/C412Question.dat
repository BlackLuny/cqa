I think the wires go to a thermocouple because there's only about 0.4 Vdc on them. There are no other wires going to the heater. The heater turns on (lights) when the wires are shorted together.    I bought a Honeywell thermostat that is supposed to work with a two-wire system, but it doesn't work. The Honeywell website says that it's made for a "24V system", but I don't think that's what I have.   The old thermostat was thrown away when the house was remodeled and the local hardware stores don't know what I need.   Any ideas?

Last year after a storm damaged the supporting fence the old grapevine was on,  I depended on a friend to build a trellis for me. Didn't happen. I can't allow it to stay this way another year since the vine has sustained some damage.  It is one grapevine with a trunk that is four to five inches thick and 40 to 45 feet long.  At the head of the trunk, the part that form the "v", one side is badly damaged and has to be cut.  I discovered that a section of damaged side rooted.  Therefore, I'm hoping it will survive since it appears to be self-sustaining now.  The other end of the "V" is the longest and has many shoots. I was advised to prune before April when the bud start to burst. I live in zone 7.  It is safe to cut and propagate before April?      The vine is heavy that I wonder if PVC pipes will provide good long term support.  Previously, it was on unsightly rusted metal poles and fencing wires.   Wood is out of the question.  This will be my breaking fingernails project so it has to be simple to build.      Any advice on how to build a trellis or how to save the grapevine? Thank you.

I just bought a Living room set and  I am being offered Fabric Protection for $99 for 7 years. Supposed to cover everything from ACCIDENTAL rips to spills. I just wonder how real is the protection. I asked the sale associate and of course she expressed it was the best ever. I just want a second opinion to see if its worth it, or does it sound to good to be true.       thanks in advance.
20090222193133AA2J09p	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Identify my cactus/succulent - no image!?	It has leaves like an aloe - plump "spears" with teeth along the edge.  They grow in pairs opposite each other, one pair inside the next with one central "spear" by itself.  The color is very dark green, much darker than the usual aloe.  My particular plant is about 3 inches tall and wide.

Sometimes in the morning my water is just luke warm, other days it'll be very hot.

It's a one bedroom/one bathroom apartment, fairly decent size living room and kitchen. My bedroom colors right now are black/red/white, which I absolutely love. I wouldn't mind keeping those colors in the bedroom but something different would be fine too! I'd like to have the kitchen and living room sort of match since they are side by side.... I've got a friend who custom makes fabric valances for above the window, as well as headboards. I'm up for any options. i'd like to keep it modern, nothing too rich, nothing too child-ish either. I'll be a senior in college and plan on keeping this apartment for at least 3 more years for grad. school. so  I want some ideas that I won't get completely sick of, or something that I can easily "upgrade" if you know what I mean. Thanks so much for your help, I know there are some extremely creative people out there who have more time on their hands than me lol. I plan on spending a week prior to move-in painting, decorating and all that! So spill your ideas (including themes, new bedspreads, paint colors, ALL THAT JAZZ!!!) Thanks SO much!!!!         Ps. Some of my favorite stores to shop at for home decor are Target, Ikea, Pottery Barn, Kirklands, Pier 1, etc....
