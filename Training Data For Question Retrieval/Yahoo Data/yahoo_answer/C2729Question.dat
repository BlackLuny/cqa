20081119170908AA6HAd5	Pets;Cats	What is wrong with my cat?	Okay so I have two cats.... both females. One is the mother of the other one. The mother and the daughter fight all the time. Lately we have been noticing feces all over the house. We think it's the mother because she may be telling the daughter that this is her home and she is the dominant female. Is this correct? Or are one of them sick? How do we tell which one is excreting?      thanks =)      xx
20081121122708AAQeY10	Pets;Dogs	Limiting the time for your pet to get vet checked+signing contracts?	two part question      1. why has the time to get your dog vet checked after you bring it home shortened so much? when i got my rottie/shepherd mix almost five years ago i had almost 2 wks to take him to the vet to get checked out. Two years after I got my mix I got a pit and I had about a week to get him vet checked. my husky rescue was check on site while i was there before i brought him home but i still had an additional week to get him checked out if i wanted. i got my yorkie almost 2yrs ago and i still had a week to have him vetted.       now the most people give you is 2-3 days. some people say that's to limit the amount of time the breeder is held responsible for air born diseases but if the puppy is up to date on it's shots like they claim it to be why would that really be such a risk?      2. most health guarantees are given on a signed contract that says you have x amount of days to get you dog checked if the dog has blah you have the option of returning the dog for a new puppy of same age, size and color or a pick from the next litter.      but most people pick the dog they have for a reason. if the dog gets sick most people don't want to give the dog back but they want to be reimbursed for the vet bills. however the contract will stipulate if they don't take the new dog the warranty is void and they won't pay vet bills or receive a refund.       i was watching one of the court shows today and they DIDN'T sign a contract. the dog had parvo and they wanted to be reimbursed vet cost. under the law they are entitled to have a refund for the cost of dog or have their vet bills paid capped at the initial cost of the dog. they paid $850 for the dog. their vet bills were like $1, 085. the judgment was in their favor for $850. so really if you wanted to keep your dog aren't you better off NOT signing a contract?
20081122121054AAf2Xc5	Pets;Dogs	How many of you actually have a dog license?	out of curiosity how many of you actually have a dog license. i'm not talking about the special order dog tags but the actual license you are supposed to get from your individual counties? i have four dogs. i had my oldest dog, a rottie/shepherd mix four about 2 yrs before i wanted to get a pit. it was only when i got my pit that i learned i needed a dog license.       aren't dog owners getting kind of ripped off? dogs are the only pets you have to pay annually for with a pet license. you don't have to do that with cats, birds or rodents
20081216233748AAUi6GP	Pets;Cats	After cat uses bathroom it leaves a foul odor?	I know, I know. Cat stool should not smeel good. But after my cat just used the bathroom is smelled horrific.

20090309182620AAIQrJF	Pets;Dogs	Both of my dogs are fixed. How do I stop the male from mounting the female?	I have a male Miniature Schnauzer who is just over 2 years old. My girlfriend bought him when he was a puppy and he was already neutered. Last week, we just brought home a female pit bull mix from the Humane Society who is about 4 months old and spayed. They seem to get along famously. However, the boy will try to mount her (sometimes successfully) whenever I am not watching. I've tried yelling at him, clapping my hands and even putting him in his crate after I've scared him away. Yet, he can't seem to leave her alone! Will he keep trying to mate with her or is he going to stop after he gets it out of his system? It's driving me nuts!

I think they'd be better off with somebody that has the time and money to give them a better habitat. So, fish peoples, are mature fish something sought after?? I'll only give them to a good home, no money involved, so I'm just wondering if I listed them if there would be any takers.

I mean, she was pregnant,and I had wanted her spayed anyway.She was at the vets over the weekend and is really attatched to me. I have a crocheted aphgan on my bed,and she started "kneading" it just today.    Also, ever since she came back from the vets,today,she has been extremly clingy,and wanting lots of "lovies" from me.    Can someone who knows about cats,please explain this?   She was abused in her last home,and then turned outside,and became feral.    My oldest daughter coaxed her inside a little at a time, and then she instantly bonded to me.   I was the one who took her to the vet and "abandoned" her there for the weekend,so she could have her feline hysterectomy/ abortion.   I feel guilty for leaving her, but I had to.    help!
20090309191522AATw6Za	Pets;Fish	60 gallon stand for a 30 gallon fish tank? will it be stable enough?	Recently we had to downgrade from a 60 gallon aquarium to a 30 gallon one. We are using the 60 gallon stand though, which is an open box frame like a rectangle. The 60 gallon covered all 4 sides of the rectangle and so it felt like it was really good support.      Now we have the 30 gallon on it, and it doesn't reach the 2 side supports. So it's resting on the front and back support by about 2" on each. Essentially it's supported by two parallel 2" supports.       I'm worried because I feel like it needs support on all 4 sides to be fully supported, but my husband feels like the two parallel supports for front/back is fine.       Does anybody have any experience with fish stands to say yes/no whether it will be stable? we have it set up and so far it's been fine.

20090309191049AA1hM4k	Pets;Reptiles	How should I entertain my tortoise?	This is a few questions:      I have a Russian tortoise (tortoise, not a turtle, so he doesn't swim) and he has a pretty big cage outside. From the time he wakes up to the time he sleeps he digs, and he's definitely digging to get out of the cage (not for fun, which I know some tortoises do). Anyway, I don't know what I can do to make him less bored. It's not like I can take him for a walk, and I can't really play with him that well (plus I'm at college four or five hours a day). Does anyone have any ideas?      Also, does anyone know of a toy he might like or a place to buy tortoise toys??      And lastly, do you think he's anxious because he's looking for a mate or something? I can't get him a friend unless there's a way to neuter tortoises because I don't want babies! (And I think another male would fight with him.)      Thanks!!

20090309184536AA3FCe4	Pets;Cats	How long will it take for my new cat to adapt?	There are some details that I want to put in here that may be very important to the answer, nevertheless, I would like to hear as many possibilities as possible.  So this may be a little lengthy!!      I adopted a cat from a local shelter on Saturday.  Her story was that she was found in the country when she was a kitten, roaming with her brothers and sisters and mother.  That was when she was a couple weeks or a month old.  She is now a year and a half and has been in foster care up until Saturday when I adopted her.  Shes a small tiger cat, spayed, not de-clawed.  The foster parent said that she liked to cuddle, play, and stayed by your side and talks a lot.  She has been her foster parent for over a year and hadn't understood why she wasn't adopted.      My wife and I brought her home in which we live in a relatively small one bedroom apartment (approximately 600 square feet), and we also have another cat.  We kept her in the carrier and thought she would look around for a while in it.  After a half hour we unzipped it but did not force her out of the carrier, and decided to let her come out on her own will.  Our other cat came to sniff and investigate, and ended up hissing at her, so I decided to let her out into our bedroom.  She immediately hid under our nightstand and stayed there until we picked her up and brought her to the couch and pet her to try and comfort her.      She went back to hiding after that, but the first night she was out and exploring (as she woke me up twice.)  The next morning we found her under the couch and took her out and held her for a little and pet her, then left her alone (as we know they mostly don't like to be picked up and like to explore on their own time.)  She ended up coming out around 10 or so last night to explore, but she seemed more nervous of our other cat than us, so we tried not to make sudden movements but she went back to hiding under the couch.      She came out and explored more last night as well, even woke me up at 7am this morning because she was on our windowsill in the bedroom and landed right next to me when she decided to get down.  Our other cat sleeps next to us in bed, and we have to leave the door cracked so that he can get to his food and litter box, otherwise he will meow his head off until we either let him out or back in, so we can't keep it closed.      This morning she came out from under the couch, and is now hiding behind the litter box in the closet.  It is more of a good hiding spot you could say, as its only a short dash to the kitchen to the food and water dish, and 3 steps to the litter box, and doesn't have to go into the living room where we are.      I just was wondering how long I should expect her to hide before she comes out while its light outside and be sociable around us and our other cat (our other cat is probably twice her size in length and height, neither of them are "fat" cats, and he is almost 8, where as she is only 1 1/2)      I don't want to force her out and scare her more, as many sources say that she will want to hide more if we pry her from her current comfort zone...any advice/time frame would be awesome!

Any adoption agencies, rescue centers, shelters, any other ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and any other information about Papillon puppies would be great. Does not need to be champion blooded, just normal adorable pup. Not too expensive, but ill accept any help at all.       A lot of information is good; how easy trainging is, do they like children, other animals(cats, dogs) shedding? walks? energy? food?  Thank you so much! (:

I got my cat from the Humane Society about 2 weeks ago, and shes been very sweet, and playful, and purring all the time. So i went to my dads house for the weekend and left her with my mom, and now im back and she keeps attacking me. I have scratches all over my arms and my hands because shes being so aggressive. I have no idea why shes acting like this. When i pet her, she wont purr, instead she bites me. I havent changed her food, she hasnt gone outside.. shes an indoor cat. Please help, i dont know whats gotten into her. I was thinking that it might potentially be because (she used to be a stray) she feels like i abandoned her?

I live in a small town and my vet is on vacation for the next week and a half (the next vet is too far away for me to get to before or after work).  My female cat, who has never been sick before, just developed very watery eyes.  The liquid is clear, sorta like she is crying.

20090309202109AApUAQn	Pets;Dogs	Quick question about dogs and...?	Okay so I need 'calming' medication for a 8 pound dog. She has anxiety with traveling and stuff and the vet says to buy ''...calming medication or medicine that helps her relax.'' Well,he didn't say WHAT one to buy and it's hard to find something for her since she's so small. She has to ride about 10 hours in her travel cage,she'll be let out to stretch,go to the bathroom and to eat and drink,but she cries every single time she gets put in any cage. Considering she'll be so close,she'll be in the backseat of a Camry,we can't have her crying all 10 hours. No,she will not stop until she gets out of the cage and she won't hold still if she rides loose. Thanks.

At least that's what I think. My rabbit was given to me as a present, but the person didn't find out its sex or age. So, I'm not sure if it's a female who is ready for mating or a submissive male. I would check for its sex, but it's really skittish and always squirms away.    Any suggestions/answers as to why it lifts its behind while being pet?

I caught it early, and my vet said he should be fine. He got an antibiotic and muscle relaxant shot. The vet also gave me Hill's RX diet C/D wet food and told me to take him off dry food immediately. My cat is 12, and has had dry food his whole life, he won't eat the wet. I put the can in his dish along with a few kibbles, but he won't touch it. It's breaking my heart to see him cry for his regular food and knowing I can't give it to him. I hate the thought of him going hungry.       Could someone please help me on the proper way to switch him to wet food so that it's not so traumatic? Also if anyone could recommend good wet foods for urinary tract health that would be appreciated.

They say he is 10 weeks., but he looks very skinny. Anything you can suggest to fatten him up? Also, what is by far the best food to feed this dog? How often should I feed him  now, and how often should I feed him once he gains his weight? I gave him 1 can of purina chicken in the can, but im sure this is no good.

I have tried multiple methods with my new puppy, such as saying "NO"  or "OUCH", holding his mouth shut, holding him down, holding his bottom jaw, and even smacking him on the nose. NOTHING works, he just keeps biting. I don't know what to do anymore, I have had other dogs, and one of those methods has always worked, but not this time. And please don't say consult a trainer.

He doesn't even look like the same little fur ball.  Sigh...does anyone know how long it would take for his hair to grow back to what it was?  He looked like a little bear before, now more like a poodle.

20070510101024AA3vht7	Pets;Birds	Strange goose behavior!?	My husband and I have been watching these 2 geese since about mid-March.  The female layed her eggs close to 3 weeks ago.  She has stayed on the nest, while the male guards.      We went out there this morning to check on them, and about 6 feet from the nest was one of her eggs.....broken.  The embryo was dead.  Another 5 feet from that was a shell to another egg.      After about 15 minutes or so of discovering that, she quickly comes off her nest, with an egg in her bill, dunks it in a puddle of water several times, and proceeds to bathe herself.  I am almost certain that she killed it, due to the way she was handling it.      Why is she killing her young?      I initially thought someone had found the eggs, and tampered with them outside of the nest.  Little did I realize, it was HER.      I cannot find ANYWHERE on the internet why she would do this.  Everything I have read thus far, she and the male, have done it by the book.      This is odd.  Were the eggs nonviable, and she rejected them, or what?

20070530093425AALBtEo	Pets;Cats	Cat starting to urinate?	Backstory: I've had my cat (Keyser) for 8 years. We have lived with other animals at different points (belonging to roommates), and he always hates them, and always becomes alpha. My husband and I brought home a Beagle (Milo) 8 months ago. Milo had never been around cats before, so we had to keep them separated and slowly introduce them since Milo would chase Keyser.       Keyser slowly became the alpha, and Milo is even a bit afraid of Keyser, he becomes very submissive when the cat is around. Now that Keyser knows he's dominant, he is acting out and becoming very jealous.       He has recently peed on the floor a couple of times when Milo gets fed, a few feet from Milo's bowl. We have ruled out health issues at the vet, I'm pretty sure it's jealousy, maybe the cat is thinking the dog is getting treats or something. (We always give them both treats at the same time, one never gets them unless the other does.)       Any suggestions? (The litter box is very clean.)

He has lived in the same house since he was a puppy.  The other night the front door neightbors had a party and were very loud...I noticed my dog was breathing very heavy, and his tail was tucked in his bottom.  I went outside and comforted him...until the noise died out.....Last night our next door neighbors had a party, and there were kids running around and it was very noisy...same reaction from my dog.  This time I left him alone...thinking he will get over it...but when i went to check on him, he had escaped!!!  My dog has never ran away....thankfully a neighbor found him.  I am so scared now...I work and I can not monitor him 24/7.  Tonight he has done the same reaction, even though there are no parties just some kids playing in their backyard....he tried to escape again, but I yelled at him...anyone have any ideas??

20080216104140AAzRcaa	Pets;Dogs	Staffordshire Bull Terrier Gift?	Hi,   It's my Dad's 53rd birthday at the beginning of March and me and my mom are looking for a non-tacky Staffordshire Bull Terrier related gift for him.   The only things I've found so far are tasteless models that don't look anything like our dog (she's red and white with a black mask). My mom reckons that she saw someone wearing a tshirt with multicoloured Staffies on it sat in the Al Murray audience about a week ago.      Any original ideas and where we can get them from?   Thankyou!

20080222021826AAboA0A	Pets;Dogs	My dog ate raw meat from the trash, he is diabetic!?	I had meat left over from making beef jerky, and decided to through it in the trash. The meat had a special (sweet) sauce I made on it. My Minature Pinscher who is diabetic went through the trash while I was on the computer. He is really wide, and his stomach in hanging low since eating the meat, and he is breathing a little hard. He is still playful, but i'm worried because he is 11 years old and diabetic.

But then I don't want one because I'm not sure if because they're so little and fragile, I won't be able to have fun or go on walks or play with them.  this might sound stupid, but I have no experience with them.  I'd be greatful to any advice, but I'd really like it if someone told me who has actually seen how they act in real life.  Thank you, all answers are appreciated!      yogo

I am worried about my children.  so despite their consistent nagging, i let them go pet animals outside the home, but never bring a pet for them.  i did buy them a big aquarium with fish, but after a few months they got bored.  they want animals that interact more with them.  now they want a cat.  i am not sure what to do.  help!

20080330201748AAk2Qir	Pets;Fish	Platies and guppies breeding.?	Just bought 2 platies, making sure they were both male. My male guppies, the min I added the 2 platies went straight after the red platie. He was, it lokked to me, sniffing him out. The guppy gave up and went to the other one. He seems to want to mate by his fancy showing of his tail and swims almost upside down to do his thang, and it has been over 24 hours and still is hounding the male guppy. All 3 are male, could he be confussed and could they, if female, mate? I'm feeling sorry for the fish being bugged, I may just have to give the guppy away. Anyone else ever experience that?

Is any organization doing something about the treatment of the Garra Ruffa fish (doctor fish) being used in pedicures in Virginia? See  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080722/ap_o...  for more details.    If you take a close look at one of the pictures, you can see a dead fish. They are not being fed on purpose so that they have no choice but to eat people's dead skin! It's abusive!
