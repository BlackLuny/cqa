VXcp8hvHaa	waffles are illegal in Tennessee|`|YuYSL0A2aa	Go to Waffle House website, then just search for a town near where you are going to be.
VXcp8hvHaa	No they are all too tired after work, and go straight home
A8F4HF3Paa	No, they don't have a kids menu that they'll let you order from at 14.  My suggestion is to have everyone over to your house first, serve some cheaper appetizers, then head out to dinner once everyone has filled up on appetizers and they won't order as much.  That sounds terrible, doesn't it?  But it works. :-)|`|gaXUIduMaa	As a suggestion, you might want to eat someplace else (like pizza) and then go to this place for dessert only.  A lot of people do it and you will save a ton of money.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	it'll make a turd.
VXcp8hvHaa	neck ache and eyestrain
VXcp8hvHaa	no industry night for service workers.
VXcp8hvHaa	Ain't nothin' free
pbV7dnKKaa	The best way to figure that out is of course an online yellow pages, its what I use to figure that out! You can find what places deliver in Memphis. It looks like some that do are Randys Ranch Burgers, Kwik Shop Grille, Tuckers Pizza, Panchos Mexican, Oleos Sandwich Shop...... Just to name a few that arent the typical delivery type places!|`|VDpmh2VJaa	I am dying to try memphis barbq with the neeley's their food always looks so good go there and get something yummy and let me know how it taste.lol     their mac and cheese w bacon and potato chips looks to die for i dont eat mac and cheese.lol    here is a list of 20 that deliverhttp://memphis.citysearch.com/yellowpage...|`|VXcp8hvHaa	pizza hut  domino's  chinese  mazzios|`|f5un1Ljbaa	I've located a nice directory of restaurants that might help. You can narrow down the Tennessee results by cities nearby to you. If you phone a few of the restaurants you can narrow down wich one would work best for you. http://www.restaurantreviewsratings.com/...
VXcp8hvHaa	you "tryna" r ya? try spaghetti warehouse
j4uTq48Eaa	Malibu Seafood    Nobu Malibu( where all the celebs go to eat). Where TMZ hangs out.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	celebrity cafe|`|E4iUcYEjaa	Try finding a restaurant by searching through http://www.yelp.com  It's fast and easy - always helps me when I'm looking for a certain type of place.|`|C7EtCoZHaa	I love Dukes. They have really good food and its on the beach so sometimes you will see seals and dolphins. To see a lot of celebrities try Neptuenes Net.|`|36c480701058b660a79a7f09780e1b33aa	I have to agree... Duke's is awesome. they  have a place you can eat outside and inside. Their Brunch is wonderful.  If you go in between 4-7 and eat in the Barefoot Bar, they have a 1/2 price menu.  Aloha|`|e75df6a664af3ce172ac45f21fda2e44aa	Malibu Inn is great for breakfast or lunch.  Also Charthouse is good, Moonshadows is great for drinks & sunset time.    OH the best place for dinner is Taverna Tonys!  IT's Greek & SO Good. Go for Dinner!

sMjYow14aa	chernut, I've located a nice list of restaurants that might help. You can drill down the New Jersey results by cities close to you. If you visit several of the restaurants you can narrow down wich one would work best for you. http://www.restaurantreviewsratings.com/...|`|VXcp8hvHaa	el toro loco|`|HghbvVZgaa	Try      Ristorante Valentino  150 South St  Morristown, NJ 07960    Jackets for gentlemen suggested.|`|RZ0dTxqPaa	I would check out Morristown. Guerriero's and Settebello's both have great food. In Millburn there is a place called  La Campagna which is good also.    If you are further west there is a place called Brenda's on route 46 in Budd Lake.    As far as chicken marsala, I'm not sure if these place serve that exact dish because I have never ordered it or noticed it on the menu...If those don't work Im sure there is a Frank's Pizzeria in the area...
AtIPTVBOaa	I would defiantly go with Buca di Beppo.  Buca is a pretty descent priced food and with the higher priced food the more $$ you will most likely make.  And especially at Buca they can come in big parties so more people and bigger tips and it has a great family atmosphere|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	Buca di Beppo. It has a great atmosphere and it pays well.|`|uCqxkEhUaa	I would go with Buca di Beppo.  Great tips, large parties, shouldn't have to put up with nasty people, fun.|`|l1BNyWjcaa	O live near cincinnati and if were you i would apply for Buca di Beppo and  Max and Erma's and if you make one that is great both pick the one that offers you the most $$$  none try The pub and Longhorn|`|VXcp8hvHaa	longhorn
o96oCRWhaa	cullen is such an ugly last name it sounds like "culo" in spanish|`|6QJe4Mlyaa	The closest stop from Crystal Lake to Woodfield would be Palatine or Arlington Heights.  No need to go as far as Des Plaines.  Frankly I think Woodfield is a waste of time and money.  First off you are paying tax in  Cook County  that is higher than Mc Henry County.  Go over to that mall in Dundee it has pretty much all the same stores.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	did you ask your parents?  ok  ok  the closest one  unless you want to walk!  so hears your answer!|`|5mjcHNEEaa	well i could help you a little bit, the train does not run close to woodfield so you would have to take either a taxi or the bus but i dont know how that works because i never pay attention to the bus. i think that arlington heights (thats where i live) is the closest stop to the mall. the station is right near arlington heights road which you take south. then you turn right on golf street and woodfield mall is further down on the left side. probably a 15 minute car ride without traffic|`|1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	Take METRA from CRYSTAL LAKE   Arrive at DES PLAINES METRA  Take PACE BUS   208 from DES PLAINES METRA BUS STOP   Arrive at WOODFIELD MALL LOWER LEVEL PENNEY'S SW  Regular Cash Fare:Cash:$ 6.50    There are 2 other routes but this is the fastest and easiest.  Check them out at the following site:    http://tripsweb.rtachicago.com/|`|n1D90COxaa	It would be easier to just drive to Woodfield, rather than trying to take the train, or else take the train and go to downtown Chicago, that would be even easier.|`|Y4gN3b3Caa	You can catch the train in CL and take it to Palatine. I don't think there's a bus that takes u directly to the mall so your going to have to take a cab which is going to run you anywhere from $20-$30. It maybe cheaper to drive than taking the train.    http://metrarail.com/Sched/cnw_nw/cnw_nw...|`|0WASp0bHaa	There isn't a train station close to Woodfield Mall.  And there isn't a bus from the train station to the mall either.

GOD BLESS  99.5 KKLA|`|7c8b025c5777c0311126dfda9a26ba37aa	for some reason everytime I eat fast food ie McDonalds I get a phlemmy throat and it feels like if your allergic to milk and drink it and your throat gets all mucusy..so I try not to eat it anymore,it must be full of MSG.|`|QgnVXJnoaa	Burger King used to be sooo good. not anymore though. The fries are still good though. but nah, I wouldnt cheat on my bf lol for them.    havent eaten fast food in a while..but I have a weird craving thanks to this.
TDlVhthjaa	Hmm... New York is the haven of things to do for anyone in any age. I do find it hard for you to meet someone by just sticking around at a restaurant. A Broadway Musical won't do the trick either, unless you start to go really early and try to get discount tickets on Student Rush in the mornings. You Might be able to meet someone in the line there.    Visit the city's museums. Most of them are located on the Museum Mile (5th Avenue, Upper 70's).    During the winter, you can Ice Skate in Central Park. Rockefeller is just expensive and a tourist hype.    During the summer nights. Free Movies are screened on Bryant Park.    Go watch a game at The Madison Square Garden. They sometimes even give tickets away. They also air shows all year long inside the WaMu Theatre (which is inside the Garden's complex). You'll see adverstisements on billboards outside the MSG's entrance.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	walk in the park  read a book at bryant park  you will always look weird|`|pbV7dnKKaa	You know you can always go to a comedy club!!! There are a lot of amateur nights that are fun and you dont always have to be 21. You can brings your friends to watch a good show and probably have dinner there as well : > There is one in NYC called The New York Comedy Club on 24th st!|`|MT1498npaa	There are so many nice restaurants in New York City. You might be interested in working in one over the summer. And while you're there, you can explore the city more and make some friends. Go see some Broadway shows, those are always a blast!|`|GITMn6eDaa	Go to Ripleys Beleive it or not museum its so interesting enjoyable and fun or the wax museum
DshFTbcsaa	I would start with google, or a book about the time period you are interested in learning in.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	google it.
J8x2qwVdaa	Such a deal ,Moishe.......... $4.69 um goooooood|`|JfVxCDb7aa	one was 3.99 one 4.99 and two or three were 5.99---I think, or was that Perkins?|`|y5Ggaxf5aa	I think $4.99 but it's been a LONG time since I've been to Denny's
JfVxCDb7aa	maybe 3/4 of a meal. A typical American eats out maybe every other day. So it would average out to something like  this.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	me- none|`|n0iLfXrOaa	burger king macdonalds dennys in n out and sumo wrestlers houses|`|n1D90COxaa	usually 2|`|JpiGhUmAaa	Fast-Food Nation:  The average American eats three meals a week from fast-food establishments, according to the NPD Group, a consumer market research firm.
kjvGggH6aa	Probably just refills ;-) Did you hear Denny's is giving away free Grand Slams on Feb.3 6am to noon????|`|VXcp8hvHaa	hell no|`|cP5Cst6Jaa	i think between a certain time...check with the website|`|LAdW35NNaa	Nah
lJAaBmlyaa	Yeah there is a truth in menu law... My favorite is Whipped Cream... you mean whipped oil|`|wBsLjeaYaa	Technically not. If you ask they have to tell you the truth. But if they lie to you its obviously illegal.
E4iUcYEjaa	If I were you, I'd rather go to Tokyo Wako than Benihana's.  Tokyo Wako is much, much better (same kind of restaurant, different owners).  Japanese restaurants tend to be more fun to celebrate special occasions as well.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Benihana.  The experience of it is more fun and this is a festive occasion.|`|7bQUBYeNaa	Benihana! Happy 15th Birthday!
jw9n9kPRaa	You are making me crave indian for dinner.
Pc0QjrQ4aa	Presumably, they have chosen to not participate.  As long as they make this known (and the ad seems to have stated "at participating locations") and have proper signage...they've simply made a business decision.|`|AA11091315	One of them would be in CA. This state is known for housing greedy bastards that love to give nothing away and rob you blind.|`|Y90iPn9qaa	As the fine print almost always says, participation may vary. Maybe they're in a slump and simply can't afford to just give away food.
