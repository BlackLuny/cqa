raA9vMQlaa	They are making a big deal out of it. It is an issue, but it's not because of video games. It's really because the kids who play these video games may get addicted to it, and slowly become more and more anti social ad secluded over time, where video games may be the only friend. It may become the only good thing they look forward to, and when they see things that resemble it, like violence if they play many violent video games, they will take part in it bc it may be the only thing that brings happiness into their lives. <br>  <br>  The kids who play with machine guns very often take pleasure from the sport of shooting targets. They do not really take pleasure from the violence. They are having fun from shooting targets, not people.
Oj59Qdg0aa	Well no it doesn't they are just worried because of like that game wats it called. yea Man hunt yea that's right.

2b6e38008a5ce6be1cb862d0466e9028aa	I have not seen the co. you mention, but I switched to Dynowatt and it is a LOT cheaper than what I had. If you commit to 2 yrs you can lock in a low rate for 2 yrs - less than 16 cents a KWH. When I was shopping rates, Dynowatt was cheaper than TXU for sure.
W9dabUw7aa	what about renting them just for a business...not to live there...have to make sure to get the right permits though!! The other idea would be to rent just for storage....make sure you cover yourself legally though...don't want to be liable if their stuff got damaged, etc...|`|5i4vUQhgaa	rent them out for storage.
ye1oDvGNaa	I dont know about documents, but there are tons of photo hosting websites that are free... Walgreens, walmart, photobucket, rockyou, cvsphoto, etc. You could probably save your documents in your email, I know mine has the ability to do so.

9f48c2c5d11d279d8a5c090dc8700f65aa	A few days..... if after 5 or 6 days you still don't hear anything... I would stop in and ask to see the person that interviewed you and ask if a decision has been made yet...|`|ORjH7TD1aa	I used to work at Publix.  The entire store administrators have a meeting once a week to go over the applicants that have interviewed.<br>  <br>  You might have gone in the same day of that meeting, so give it at least 7 days.<br>  <br>  Good luck, Publix is a great place to work!|`|0boTBFEVaa	you never wait for them to call you because the might not ever call you do a follow up call tell them you are still interested in the job you might end up on a 2nd interview so look here <a href="http://economyhelp.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://economyhelp.blogspot.com/</a> for tips on the interview and I hope you get the job
4RjM5lElaa	An employer can establish any rules they want to enforce as policy - as long as they are reasonable.  Many employers that have a no purse rule will allow employees to carry clear purses with no pockets on the inside - and they generally keep the size to a minimum (like around a 5x6 size).  These rules are enforced for the sake of security of their product (theft deterrents).<br>  <br>  As for a safe place...do you mean as in working conditions?  If there are unsafe conditions then organizations like OSHA would love to hear about it - they will go in and assess the situation and place fines on the business if they are warranted - this is usually around the scope of unsafe equipment or conditions - like holes in the flor and metal racking that could tumble - that sort of thing.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps
J2IWbhSvaa	Why don't you just use a Tech Deck? But i've seen someone at my school with one so you probably will be able to get them somewhere. Keep looking ;)|`|W6wamWLLaa	Whats a handboard?!
