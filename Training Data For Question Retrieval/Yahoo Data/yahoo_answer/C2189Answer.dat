2Q2ltt1Saa	If you have the WotLK disc, or are willing to take the extra bit of time downloading the WotLK client, install off that.  You'll install extra 'stuff' you won't use until you buy a new WotLK key to unlock the content, but you'll have it there and updated as each new patch comes out vs. having to install WotLK and then re-patch from 3.0.2.|`|tm9egUBraa	This of course depends on your internet connection, but you may as well just install WOTLK now and leave it updating or something as you're sleeping.
53sIyhiYaa	I believe you are referring to the port on the back between the cymbals and the foot pedal. This port was dedicated to be used for a second foot pedal, but has not been activated yet. It may be a later software patch, or may come into play with newer releases of the game. <br>  Additionally there is a port on the front of the unit just below the buttons and the directional pad which is for the headset.
dYGnVjjoaa	No, nothing yet.<br>  The "Episode" naming was a marketing scheme to give the illusion that they would release content faster.<br>  Well BULLSHIT that was from them.<br>  I have read maybe at the end of 2009 to early/middle of 2010.<br>  But you know valve...........takes forever to do anything. <br>  LIKE BLIZZARD!!!|`|FodTv52Iaa	No more information. All I can find on it so far is some random concept art.|`|sYxUVBvPaa	The reasoning for the "Episodes" is not for marketing. They did it based off of the fact that they knew releasing games one at a time and spending years developing them is wasted because of the pace of technology. By the time they are done with the game, it is 2 years behind. To fix this issue of time and efficiency, they release the episodes to allow the game to evolve with the times. Admittedly, its been a while since we have seen a new episode but its still shorter than the 10 year gap between HL and HL2
Z2EzfQFvaa	No,it doesn't.|`|6f2c903eae4fc8a81f741a6b9dc5f770aa	no.<br>  but if you're a love struck girl between the ages of 13 and 30ish then yes it does as for the rest of us no.

RVpl9ZeIaa	Yeah, it's called effect monsters. Heraklinos can't negate monster effects so that's it's weakness.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, counter trap cards cannot be countered by Heraklinos because they are spell speed 3 and Hera is only speed 2.<br>  <br>  <br>  The best monsters to take down Heraklinos with are:<br>  <br>  * Snipe Hunter<br>  * Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter<br>  * Gravekeeper's Guard<br>  * Penguin Soldier<br>  * Raiza the Storm Monarch<br>  * Caius the Shadow Monarch<br>  * Zaborg the Thunder Monarch<br>  * Gale Lizard<br>  * Wall of Illusion<br>  * Man-Eater Bug<br>  * Old Vindictive Magician<br>  <br>  <br>  The best traps to take out Heraklinos are:<br>  * Divine Wrath<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously, if you don't know how to take down something as simple as Heraklinos, you don't deserve to be playing this game. The card practically has "kill me with monster effects" written all over it.|`|oHOBStehaa	Gladiator Beast Heraklinos is by far one of the best GB that cripples your opponent's deck. The Gyzarus-Heraklinos combo would really finish off any deck (if they recover from it, then what luck!). I know that a Heraklinos rising from this combo would pretty much end the game (really). Oh yeah, don't forget the all-powerful Chariot-Heraklinos with Equeste coming out (another crazy lockdown). I'm naming all this so that you can find a way to loop around it. <br>  Monster Effects are the answer (already mentioned it before but the "crazy lockdown" would screw these effects over).<br>  Cards: Metagame deck key cards!<br>  Ex. Dark Armed Dragon, Judgment Dragon, etc. <br>  Also, negate it's summoning by using Solemn Judgment. Another solution is making the opponent top-deck in order to let him choose to play that card or to just wait and use Heraklinos' effect. So, make him/her use/discard his/her cards because I don't think GB decks have some kind of drawing engine.<br>  Anyways, good luck man.|`|UetuwbYnaa	first of all get the card exchange . i'm going to tell you what the card does later. So ok in order to summon gladiator beast herakilnos your opponent needs gladiator beast laquari so this is what you do. so use exchange . this is what it does. summon it and your and your opponent show your hands. then you pick a card from your opponents hand and your opponent picks a card from your hand . so put exchange in face down mode . then when your opponent has the monster use exchange .

It was like that with the Wii also, it took awhile for the Wii shop channel to really take off.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm fairly new to the DSi and I haven't read a ton about it. =(|`|6NUii24qaa	well, all of the DSi extra capabilities are region locked. The WIFI signal you need to download games in japan is different in the US. So, the DSi won't recognize the WIFI signal. Also the DSi specific games are region locked.

Although hesounds tough, he is quite a wimp. For anyone whose ever killed a wyvern thisquest will put you to sleep. If you are new to the monster hunter world thiswill not be so easy. The best strategy for killing a kut-ku, in my opinion,is to attack its wings. The reason being, the wings are very weak and willmake the Kut stagger often. Another, more important reason, is that thewings are soft and don't require much sharpness to pierce. Also, it isimportant to BRING SOME EXTRA WETSTONES.

QT6iRQNaaa	Umbreon: The second Friendship based evolution of the Eevee. Simply have the Eevee evolve in the night time to get this form when it loves you. This form is renowned for its ability to just tank hits. It has the Hit points and defenses as well as a good type for this. It also has a rare combination of Mean Look and Baton Pass among many other moves. This is a defensive Pokemon no matter how you look at it. To change to an offensive style, moves like Payback, Pursuit and other condition based attacks are best. The use of Curse is also recommended as Umbreon isn’t very fast to begin with and its got the raw potential to just take a beating, especially with either Moonlight or Wish.|`|5yBAMbIZaa	u cant really tell if an eevee or any other poke is happy or not just keep them out of battles and whenever they get in a battle take them to a poke center to recover completely that will make them "happy"

4LtszRxEaa	Ive seen both those games and to me 50 Cent Blood On the Sand because its much more realistic (wel its not realistic but more realistic then Resident Evil) 50 cent looks great because of Coop and cover system. Although  no-one is expecting this to be good because they said the first 50 cent was bad. But this is on the Next-Gen system and I thought looks fantastic. I never really liked The Resident Evil series but if you were a fan of the series thats probably the best for you. But buy a used copy of 50 cent and if it sux return it to gamestop for full price and get Resident Evil 5 or vice-versa. Resident Evil 5 could be terrible and could not live up to the series I have seen games that are awesome but made sequals and the sequals sucked. Have fun I hope you enjoy whatever game you choose.|`|pRXejsdXaa	resident evil 5 <br>  <br>  NO CONTEST|`|bS5wpKvOaa	Resident Evil 5 looks like an okay game with good graphics.

RVpl9ZeIaa	In terms of fun:<br>  1. 360<br>  2. Wii<br>  3. PS3<br>  <br>  <br>  The Wii is an excellent recreational machine as well as a time killer, if you like simple games. The 360 is superior in every way to PS3, better exclusive games (safe for a few), better interface, dashboard, community, etc.<br>  <br>  You definitely get your money's worth with the 360 and Wii.<br>  <br>  There's a reason PS3 fell to third place in last quarter sales.|`|pjdb70Zaaa	Definittely not the PS3.

PL58Map8aa	to get wrath of the lich king you need to buy the burning crusade. If you live in australia like me:) it will cost around 30/40 dollars. When you buy the expansion set you need it install it a stuff, that would take a couple of hours (depending on your internet speed). when you have done this you will have to buy the Lich King expansion set which is about 60 dollars australian. To install thins will probably take about another couple of hours. i hope this helped you out?|`|k3cmetWRaa	You have to pay for one time each expansion.<br>  Afterward you continue paying the regular subscription fee.<br>  If you haven't purchased the game yet, then you can get WoW and TBC as a package deal which is cheaper.<br>  <br>  Blizzard will eventually release a trilogy with WoW + the 2 expansions, but probably not for a while since they are focused on other important matters such as gettting Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is what the expansion does in terms of the world...<br>  <br>  The Burning Crusade allows you to level between 60 and 70.<br>  This expansion opens up Outlands.<br>  <br>  Wrath of the Lich King allows you to go from 70 to 80.<br>  This expansion opens up Northrend.<br>  <br>  And don't pay some to play your game for you... <br>  That's pathetic, build your own character and learn how to play him so people are made when they get you in a group and you don't know how to play the game.

They are based in Nevada State so it is very safe and reliable, unlike all the other unsafe websites that are from foreign countries.

aO5i61Cfaa	Unfortunately, that's just not something you're able to do in Rock Band.  The closest things I can think of are in Guitar Hero World Tour, you can create your own tracks, and in Rock Band 2, you can freestyle play the drums over any song on your console's hard drive, but even then it's not really the same.
IzN0nv9caa	Its been a long time since I ran WC but I think you can run it at level 12.At that level you will draw aggro like CRAZY so stay close enough to get experience (you said someone was running you) but back away from whoever is running you. Something a level 30 can walk by from 10 feet away, you will draw aggro from 30 feet. It is very aggravating for someone who is nice enough to give you a run to have to wait for you to do 10 corpse runs. Have fun. That is a big dungeon with lots of bosses and plenty of nice drops : )<br>  Scott<br>  <a href="http://www.SmartWarcrafter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.SmartWarcrafter.com</a>
fvre0o9laa	Some machines don't let you drop the feed dogs (did you call your dealer or Brother and ask?).  I'd look around to see if there's a dial or lever or switch near the underside of the front of the machine that can be switched.    If you don't find anything, don't despair.  Set the stitch length to 0 and cover the feed dogs (I use a taped-down piece of credit card plastic with a needle hole drilled through it on my old Singer 15).|`|EXpaRBsyaa	Sonyaka K is right on the money!!!  There are very few machines which do not have this feature, and NO, it isn't permanent.  You can raise and lower the feed dog as much as you like.  NOTE: When you lower the feed dog and then raise them again, the machine has to make one revolution of the handwheel for the feed to engage.  This is a built-in safety feature, but freaks some people out since they think the machine doesn't work if the feed doesn't come up as soon as they engage the lever.|`|AA10269450	I am a sewing machine tech and will tell you that not every machine has that feature. Yours isn't listed for one but if it has one it would have a lever near the bobbincase outside or inside the door or benieth the machine.  Good luck.|`|22oMednCaa	I have a very similar Brother machine.  Here's how to do it on mine; yours is probably the same:    Remove the tray at the front (the one holding your spare bobbins and extra feet) by sliding it to the left. Look at the area that's been exposed. There should be a lever in there (mine is off to the right) with a couple of icons indicating "feed dogs up" and "feed dogs down."     Hope that helps!
XhUuXmWKaa	woah woah woah, you are considering getting a 20 gig HD just to play another measly map pack of halo 3? come on, L4D is an extremely addictable game, once you buy you will be like "halo, shmalo!" but seriously, with halo ODST around the block, why even bother for those map packs? I seriously think you are better off getting L4D instead of the HD, the online is unbelievable, way better than halo 3, please believe me. <br>  P.S. the new map packs for L4D, are being released for FREE! and do not use up more than over 200 to 500 mb of storage (so far).|`|vExQCsNYaa	I used to have a 20g hd and onced the nxe came out, it sucked. I could only install like 2 games at a time with only my saves and a couple map packs for halo and cod4. Now my 120g hard drive is amazing. I have more space than I know what to do with and I'll never need another one as long as I have my 360. If you don't want that much space, you should at least get a 60g. It has quite a lot of space and is much cheaper|`|OF4FiIKPaa	I have a 20G hard drive and it sucks because the space seems to always limit me to what I want to store on my 360.  I assume you're talking about an XBOX 360.  I like to download free demo games and pics and stuff.  Someone once talked me into paying for something expensive even though I wanted to be cheap at the time.  I was thankful for that later.  So my opinion is that you should save up enough money to buy the 120G hard drive and never worry about running out of space again.

Not taking care of it<br>  2.  Overheating it (playing way too much)<br>  3.  or using a model from 2007<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well, if your going to be planning on buying a PS3, I recommend sending the 360 back to Microsoft and they will either fix it, or send you a new one.<br>  <br>  You can't go wrong owning both of them.  The PS3 as less issues, but the Blue Ray is fairly useless with the right kind of TV.<br>  Xbox has issues with the earlier 360's though, because they rushed the released to beat PS3.  The new ones are fine though.|`|abGyKT0Paa	Ok here's the problem for the 360 if you get a new game 2009+ and do not have xbox live you may not beable to play it.

caOfuKl5aa	Don't get the Arcade.  Waste of money.  You need one with a hard drive & the Arcade doesn't have one, that's why it's so cheap.  If you want to do any online gaming, or even play original Xbox games on the 360 you will need the hard drive.  It's totally worth the wait and money to get the hard drive.|`|H6D6jlKGaa	I have the premium one, it has 60GB hard-drive where as the arcade dosent have a gard-drive on so it would cost you a lil more to buy a hard-drive for it!!    Wait 2 n half weeks, and get the better one!!|`|tuKY5Q7Waa	Well worth waiting for the premium, you'll need the harddisk so you can download firmwire updates and so, so you might as well get it with the harddisk (and it'll be cheaper than having to buy the harddisk separately).|`|FIRmuRikaa	Yes.   As more memory. and also Xbox live gold|`|cWjrtIlKaa	Go premium dude its much better, you are gonna want the extra harddrive space.|`|G8IRX295aa	Premium. Trust me:] you cannot always get what you want right away, sometimes you have to wait.|`|6STxgw9laa	If you're not going to play on Xbox Live then you should get the Arcade as it's cheaper - but it would certainly be worth the wait to get a Premium.|`|qUuafpuwaa	Buy a PS3 80GB, its $100 more than the pro(premium) but comes with more features(built in wireless adapter, extra $100 for a wireless adapter for 360).    But if you're dead set on buying a console with a 31% failure rate, wait till you have enough for the pro(premium).|`|jr4aNLLlaa	The premium is the better choice you get a 60g HDD with the arcade you don't,and you also get no b/c with original xbox games. Honestly i wouldn't recommend the xbox itself because it has a high failure rate, doesn't include a HD media player(blu-ray or HD DVD) or wi-fi and once your on xbox live downloading tv shows,content you will begin to run out of space and the 120g HDD cost about 179.99. So my advice is the ps3 if you have a little more patience and save up you could get a better deal in the long run,with the ps3 you get blu-ray,80g or 160g with the premium the HDD are 2.5 portable laptop HDD that can be upgraded at any time(i have a 320g HDD in my ps3 only $84, you have built in wi-fi, and you can run linux on the ps3. So if you look at the whole picture you get alot more with the ps3, anyway on the xbox the premium is the better deal compared to the arcade|`|uRknQZayaa	Premium! and gold live, so worth it.|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	get the premium. u can save like 1 thing on the arcade.|`|ivg0lRUraa	definetly the premium..you're going to want the 60gb HD|`|2fqXT9W6aa	Yeah, wait till you have enough for the premium, it'll definitely be worth it.

154dzJ1Faa	All fabric is woven or knit.  There are some that are felt, but we don't use them too often.    Yes, weaving has been around for a very long time.  No one knows when it started.  It is still being done by hand today, because machines can only do some things.  For special fabric, you need to have hand-contol over its production.  Knitting also has been done for thousands of years, as far back as anyone can go.  Some of the early work is incredibly fine and complicated.  Machines are also limited to what they can do.  Early Egyptian linens (made out of cotton or flax) are much finer than anything we do by machine today.    Many people still weave and knit a lot of fabric today -- by hand.  There is nothing like quality made fabric done by hand!  Check your neighbourhood -- there is probably someone there doing it now.|`|SqrPpm5Daa	There are a lot of different ways to make fabric and then make clothes.  Too many to list here but there are a lot of books on the subject.|`|PXWVGQyAaa	Clothes are  woven or knitted, either by hand or by machine.|`|UR5Ql3KFaa	All of these ans. tell you how fabric is made commercially....They're all good..But I'd like to add something to that..I subscribe to two sewing mags..---Sewing Savvy--and Sew News...Also Crafters Choice Book Club....There is a lot of instructions available for what they call making your own fabric...which is ways to embellish fabric you buy..over-dying,pin-tucks, smockings, and more than I can mention here..Hope you enjoy looking into these fun,creative things..

I made the mistake of doing the same thing you did - buying a Wii at launch - and I completely regret it. It is the lamest system I have every played, more so than the Gamecube. The concept of it is really cool, but once you get over the initial excitement of it and find out that there are only 3-6 decent games worth buying, you realize how worthless it is, and it just becomes an expensive paper weight.|`|OugNf0x6aa	Depends. Wii is much more interactive, but has a little lack in graphics, but easy to work around.

You should just get some more stuff for your 360. Do you have LIVE? Go and buy some Microsoft Points and hit the LIVE arcade, or get Downloadable Content for your games in the Marketplace. Or go buy some new stuff not even related to gaming. I think what you have is good, another system would be a waste.|`|vBWoAPO6aa	DUMBASS you should of not got an xbox cause your friends have it so what the wii is fun to play so is the  ps3 but if your a gamer go with the ps3 but if you really like the wii rebuy the wii again|`|veo90jn8aa	wiis are awesome they r'nt 4 babies. it will get u off the couch!! they have lots of cool sports games. my little brother has football, baseball, soccer, and tennis games they are really cool.|`|2fqXT9W6aa	You won't enjoy either as much as the Xbox 360, but between Wii and PS3 I'd say PS3.|`|NQlsHCOfaa	PS3|`|fxDskkKyaa	go down to the shop your gonna buy it from and look at the games for sale   see if anything catches your eye that should make up your mind for you  you never know you might just walk out with 3 XBOX games   Wii is a fun console offers some fun little games the lego games are cool, tilting swinging moving the controller is original and fun  PS3 also some nice games a little more "grown up" than the wii   but dont let the "age" brackets the consoles are put into affect your decision your playing the games not showing it off as an identification of your age|`|FHxz6lmraa	wii sucks get a ps3|`|GcZRN4kkaa	ps3 all the way|`|fGPNFnikaa	Ps3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|i6FTU2Xyaa	Get a Ps3 Becuase Wii games are not that fun and Ps3 has way better games!|`|HWTaO0xUaa	I think the WII is pretty boring after a while.

So I would get a playstation 3 because the graphics are better and more for advanced gamers.|`|c36ad8ae7d475a826f0a68ea9789e21caa	I thoroughly enjoy my Nintendo Wii.  I have played PS3 and I was not impressed.  Yeah, it is true it comes with a blue-ray player and the games are more graphic intense.  I think you will enjoy any of the consoles you get.

If you already pre-ordered it, don't cancel the order-it will come out, you just have to wait a little longer if you live anywhere outside of North America.     Hope this helps!|`|Ez4pKHqbaa	i just found out that the sims 2 is now delayed to june i am ver very angry about this cuse i was exsited about it coming out on the 20th but i guess we have to wait booooooooo

HAXN2YW2aa	Usually the most common way to get magic Levels is to just high alch and for level 94 it will cost about... 9mil? and thats the quickest way possible :). And to Kevin or w/e your name is you dont know anything. you can't hack that game..|`|HlgSu0ZJaa	Wow you're such a desperate nerd, go find something else better to do. Go outside play some sports, chill with friends.  One way you can hack it is: use visual C++, and create your own program to hack it or google up hacks. DUH!
AyiDXBTxaa	Magic is definitely the most fun to use, especially with ancients. The only drawback is that it's incredibly expensive. It'll cost you a few million gp to get 1 mil exp.<br>  <br>  Melee has a big advantage in that you don't need to resupply your weapons (unless you're using barrows).<br>  <br>  I never really got into ranging, so I dunno what to tell ya with that.|`|YtpfwKhHaa	The best thing imo is mage, if you could switch back to normal spellbook at the alter(use back entrance), and cast curse on the zammy guy in the varrock castle.|`|EQYE1QCyaa	go with mage and get heaps of runes before u fight. your runecrafting should be good and go to fist of guthix to train mage because in fist of guthix u get free runes for the while|`|6BBxyubYaa	ranging ain't all its hyped up to be lemme tell ya i'm 99 range in game (king kyle41) and to be honest melee is just alot better of a skill to get easy kills in...get your attk to around 75-80 and str to 90+ do this at ankous with a ammy of salve (e) (from the haunted mine quest) and you'll get the runes you need for 94 mage...make sure to get 175 quest points and get barrows gloves from the recipe of disaster quest too|`|MnEHO9u9aa	you dont neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed thegayescape help you waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaant thegayescape help|`|JxSM7ByUaa	melee is the cheapest, but i reckon that mage is most effective<br>  you can make your own runes so it wont be expensive :)

9520efa622db29f4035a4a3b187e7948aa	Well the other icon, not the player weapons icon, is the Persona icon. It's more about the mentality aspect then the physical part. Unfortunately, I don't know what they all mean, and I can't seem to find any where, where they are.
tHFY2hg4aa	By soundtrack, do you mean the game booklet that came with the game? I have Vice City and my game manual lists every song in that game (that is played to its full length, not one on a commercial). <br>  So, what you need is to see what radio station it plays on in the game. Know which songs are played before and after it if you can't figure out the songs name. It is listed in exact order by station in the game manual towards the back.<br>  As for the name of the song, I haven't got a clue. It might be one of the songs that I choose not to listen to on that game.
tRKAgC6faa	it's a custom song so you can't get it. someone made it on their own disc so it's not available to the public. bummer d00d.
pbMnfypEaa	the bundles are decided by the stores, theres alot with panda and indiana plus 2nd controller atm as its a box with the 3 extras in it seperate from the console. many shops offer bundles with that bos and another game.. so you could get that and trade in parts you dont want|`|lQGDV7MEaa	The 360 that comes with those games is the Arcade, if I'm not mistaken, which comes with an all white 360. The elites are black (and in the near future, red too), and are $399.99.

If so, the answer is no.  Nintendo has found a way to block putting up hacked Pokemon.
kVYtsKpYaa	Well I'll give you two options here, since Xfire isn't the greatest in recording in-game footage. <br>  <br>  OPTION 1:To get Xfire to work with Combat Arms in-game, you'll be needing to modify one of Xfire's .ini file (.ini is just a fancy .txt file). <br>  <br>  Find where you installed Xfire (Usually C:\Program Files\Xfire) find "xfire_games.ini" and double click on it (or open with notepad if that doesn't work). <br>  <br>  CTRL-F and search for 'combatarms' without quotes. You'll then be at the Combat Arms entry. Find where it says 'RunElevated=1' and paste the following lines under it:<br>  <br>  InGameRenderer=D3D9<br>  InGameFlags=USE_PRESENT|ENABLE_MOUSE|U...<br>  <br>  (if the second line cuts off the page, <br>  the rest is SE_DINPUT_MOUSE right after the U)<br>  <br>  Now save it the .ini file, close and reopen Xfire. Xfire should automatically be setup to work in game now. <br>  <br>  Start up Combat Arms. When you get into a game, you'll notice "Xfire in-game enabled" at the bottom right or something like that. Then you should be able to record video/take screenshots. <br>  <br>  Refer to the Xfire window->tools->options-> chat tab for the hotkey bindings.<br>  <br>  OPTION 2: Since I find Xfire's recording methods a bit slow (it compresses the video file and makes recording harder on the computer), you should try recording with Fraps (warning: Fraps does not compress its files much. A 1 minute recording can be up to 500mb (with sound + full-size recording)).<br>  <br>  If you need anything (read:anything), email me (ryusensei@ymail.com)
9CnV79yoaa	I use to play that.<br>  Try downloading it again.<br>  Maybe something went wrong in the download<br>  Or maybe you're connection isn't good<br>  Or it could be lagging and just exits. It happened to me before on a really slow computer.

eD7qRBKHaa	Magic Kingdom - jump from ride to ride all day long.  Epcot - there are some rides, but to enjoy the experience, you need to be willing to interact a little, walk around and explore a little, and stop-and-smell-the-roses.  Would your boyfriend enjoy that or not?     Epcot is broken into two sections.  The front part is called Future World, and here is where you will find the rides.  Test Track, Mission:Space, and Soarin are the big rides.  The back section is called World Showcase.  There are a couple of tame rides at Norway and Mexico, but mostly, you need to walk around each of the country pavilions.  You will be looking at displays, shops, etc.  So it's not a thrill-a-minute park.  Personally, I really enjoy Epcot.  However, if I were going for just one day, I would prefer to go to either Magic Kingdom or Hollywood Studios, because I would want to ride.|`|pkDuhKQ3aa	Disney Studios could be also considered a park for adults as well|`|8zE2gjReaa	You are right: Magic Kingdom does have kiddie rides. A  And Epcot is basically a World Pavilion. It has 11 different "Countries" and each has there own culture in it. You can get food, beer, and there are rides in some of the countries. But there are a few rides the. Test Track is fun. its kind of obvious but you testing a "car" on a "track". its fastpaced and one of the better rides.  so for an older person i would recommend Epcot. Also check out the disney site for more info and stuff|`|ajnGHNr8aa	Epcot is a more adult themed park but does have some good rides. Mission Space, Test Track, Soarin are thrill rides he should enjoy. The front of Epcot has the rides while the back has the World Showcase, which I find boring (39). The food choices from each country are neat, but unless he likes to shop, there is not much to do in this area.   Disney is a kid themed park, but I still enjoy it. There are some adult rides for you to go on and the shows are enjoyable. I personally enjoy the Magic Kingdom the best of the two but i would suggest going to Disney.com and look at the parks and decide together.  What ever you do, you will have a great time. Disney just makes you feel special for some reason.|`|UE1evlTlaa	Magic Kingdom is a great experience if it is your first time to Disney World, no matter what age you are. BUT, I think you all would really enjoy Epcot. There is a lot more to do for the older crowd and is a ton of fun.    I actually went with my boyfriend who is 25 a few weeks ago and we had a great time! We had a great time on all of the rides: Soarin', Spaceship Earth, Mission Space, etc. But, the best part was walking around the World Showcase together. It is such a good time! You can visit tons of different countries in a matter of a few hours. Each country has great souvenier shops, dining options, and drink stations. It is so fun to drink a drink from each country and just walk around to see the sites. Plus, there is a great show at the World Showcase at night called Illuminations and I am sure both of you would love it!|`|q6CWdCQGaa	Well if you have already been to Magic Kingdom, then I would go to Epcot. That way you are experiencing something new together!    Me and my husband (ages 26 & 28) went in September. We both agreed that Epcot was our favorite. And I know this contradicts everything that you will read online! Actually when we planned the trip, I had no intentions of going to Epcot, because everyone said it was boring. But we are really glad we did!    I think your boy friend would love test track, it's defiantly a man's ride! So is the mission space! And my husband really liked the Spaceship Earth. It was romantic to walk through the pavilions of the different countries. And you can score a wonderful dinner at the many restaurants!    Magic Kingdom is wonderful but you are right about it mostly having kid type rides.    I think you would be very happy with Epcot. It offers a lot that is focused on your age group. It usually handles crowds really well. It isn't as crowded as Magic and we saw more adults and less children than at Magic. I would suggest making dining reservations well in advance if you know where you want to eat! Have fun!|`|uYGdpD9Aaa	Epcot is for older people.  Magic Kingdom is for younger|`|p6oDbJxOaa	Epcot would definetly be best. In the global showcase, they have many "countries" from around the world, each offering a unique experience. If you want to actually go on a ride, there's Test Track and Mission Space.    If you want a romantic evening, I suggest eating a nice dinner in France and then watching the nightly firework display. Have fun!

gKEbUVtfaa	Don't worry, a few of my N64 games have done that too and they all work fine. It will not effect the game in any way take my word for it. There have always been strange things like that, not just with games, even my guitar makes a rattle noise! Lol but back to your question, the game is NOT broken, it will work fine. N64 is the strongest system made in my opinion.|`|ec5p9jbZaa	its nothing to worry about. the rattling wont affect the game. i have some N64 games that are like that and they still work fine. i always wondered why it made that noise but i never worried about it because it always worked. the N64 game should be fine.|`|gYoz91gpaa	theres probably nothing wrong since those games were made so long ago and they are probaby supposed to do that. Why would you buy an N64?? Get a Wii or somehting N64 games have bad graphics.|`|DdqAM9Yiaa	dont worie about it they all do that there is a little tag pin for identfying it when it is being made it comes apart on the inside a lot its nothing|`|P6NptCz8aa	Some of my N64 games do that too, it's no biggy. What happens is sometimes when the manufacturer clamps the two sides together around the game chip, sometimes a piece of plastic breaks off from the cover and gets stuck inside. It's nothing harmful, just a little piece of plastic.
A9vxi8piaa	Diamond armlets works if you open the treasure that contain rare item. I mean if the treasure contains usual item, you will get it although you wear Diamond Armlet. For example when you try to get Fomalhaut. You must wear Diamond Armlet. Unless you wear it, you will only get knot of rust. So that's how Diamond Armlet works|`|dpGNPT4waa	Diamond Armlets works on ALL Chest the problem is that the chances of getting a good Item is very tough.....note is here a normal chest without diamond armlet.    Chest/without DA    50% Chance of Gil(random depending no the chest)....  50% chance of Item(they have two items you can get)    Most likely a Knots of Rust and another Item a Potion or a Hi-Potion or better depends on which area you are in.    Soo..what this means is when you go for a chest without DA, you have a 50% chance of getting Gil...or a 50% chance of getting a Item...if you get Item. it has a % of which one you get, so lets say the chest has a potion and a ether for it's two Items...it would be like a 60% chance of getting Potion and a 40% chance of getting ether....now with DA this gets even more harder to get the Item you need...this is why.        Chest with DA(Ribbon)    50% Chance of getting Gil, 50% Chance of getting Item....    When you get Item you have a 90% chance of getting a Knots of Rust, and a 10% chance of getting a Ribbon...o.0    this is why you get so many Knots...with DA all Items are 90% to 10% so you will have to open that chest alot to get the 10% item...I hope I make sense o.0 lol.
gKEbUVtfaa	The Jesus Room in Left 4 Dead is in the First campaign "No Mercy" in the last chapter "Rooftop Finale" It's a room where no zombie can find out where you are and have very much trouble getting in. The zombie literally start killing themselves, even the tanks! So you can stay there until the helicopter comes. Just watch out for special infected when you leave. To get to it you need to go on top of the roof where there is a huge satellite. There is a staircase leading up to a door which you cant open, you need to make the zombies break it down by standing on the ledge over it. Just be patient and the zombies will break it. Contact me if you need any help.

xdYX9DLCaa	your range lvl would have been helpful but...if you need a quick mil i say either go to ankous with a lot of food, or skill. you can cut yews for a while. i think 2.5k of them would make a mil. im 74 range at the time and i love doing avianshies in gwd. its 500k for every 200 kills. you can also do green dragons. couple of places for them. east of clan wars and i think in the craters north of varrock. dunno exactly where that is. you can also merch......but to make decent money from that u need at least 2 mil. you can also get runecrafting up and run natures in the abyss, thats pure money :P. umm i think thats it for your lvl so far. hope this answered it|`|AA10830501	here are a few random ways to get money<br>  <br>  -go to the cooks guild and go to the top floor and get grapes then sell in the GE for about 300gp each<br>  <br>  -chop logs<br>  <br>  -fish lobster/swordfish/shark then sell at GE<br>  <br>  and those are a few ways to get some money.|`|njDZg2uFaa	well i was going to say go kill ppl but thats not really a choice i guess|`|IPMr6zEJaa	Easy money!!!!! omg:<br>  <br>  go to the gnome stronghold, up to the tree by where the bank is, near the top kinda. theres like a pond with frogs you can pick up. jus collect them, then run to the bank and store them. do this until you have say, 280, then go to the AH and sell them for like 300gp each!!!|`|AyiDXBTxaa	The fastest that I could think of for your levels would be investing in the GE.

Otherwise, money well spent.|`|aO6blblYaa	worth it.

yR74PnPTaa	Well the first thing you can do, and this may seem like an obvious thing but, test it.  Play it with a friend or two, see if you guys enjoy it, if you do move on, if you don't I wouldn't expect many other people to so go back to the drawing board.<br>  <br>  Secondly word of mouth is a great way to spread a game, tell a friend, have them tell a friend, and so on and so fourth, you wouldn't believe how fast some things can spread.<br>  <br>  If you are truly serious about spreading your game outside of your local area/play and are confident in it, post it on a forum or two, host a party or game with it locally to make sure no one forgets it, make a website, and most importantly just put your game out there whenever possible, and gauge peoples reactions.  Don't be afraid to take criticism, someone may have the idea to turn your game from poor/good to amazing, use it!<br>  <br>  And last, just have fun with it!  The liklihood that your game will spread very far?  Slim to none.  However you can and (if you made a somewhat decent game) enjoy it locally with friends, family, etc. and as long as someones getting fun out of it I'd say it's fullfilling it's use as a game wouldn't you?<br>  <br>  Best of luck and hope that helped.|`|GckGDQrhaa	I know how you feel.  I even asked on this site who wanted to learn my trading card game (playable online) and got it taken down and lost 10 points.  However, uploading it to youtube doesn't really help.

My tcg has only been up on youtube for 3 months and did not even get 200 views let alone a single comment.<br>  <br>  Anyway if you need someone to try it out, just contact me, especially if you can play it online.  We can help each other out by playing each other's tcgs you know.  It's just rough but I suggest to help you balance things, play it solitaire style.  It takes longer because you know the game very well (don't know how quick the learning curve is for someone who doesn't know) plus you're not as aware of overpowered cards (since you're playing both decks), but you'll learn eventually.<br>  <br>  I know I had to edit a lot of things, most of which by playing my tcg solitaire style.  Anyway, contact me and I can try out your tcg.|`|3g5fviahaa	Put it on youtube, blog and forums.

ELovXY9Paa	nope.<br>  the minimum video card required is an nvidia 6600, and the fx5200 is significantly below that.  also, I would never recommend running COD4 on anything less than 1gb of ram, especially if you're running vista.  As far as the processor goes, it depends on the speed, but my sempron can't run it at all.  the lowest specs you can feasibly run it on is an AMD athlon 64 3500+ (2.2 ghz) 1gb RAM and an nvidia 6800, which is what I used to use to play COD4.  i've upgraded since then, but if you don't have everything AT LEAST that good, I would strongly advise against buying the game, because you won't be able to play it.  Even with those minimum specs, you can only run it on low settings, but the game is still very photorealistic.  Don't worry, it will still look very good, just without all the effects that a better system can handle.|`|TRaXz61baa	There is a very easy way to see if your PC can run any game.<br>  Try this website, it will analyze your PC and tell you exactly how each component of your PC will handle the game.|`|kZWdN8qVaa	It Will Work On Any computer the question is will it be good? <br>  <br>  With  This Computer It Should be pretty good.

This is especially true with the Dark Brotherhood with high pay for the kills and valuable rewards if completed under certain circumstances.<br>  <br>  Another solution is to go dungeon raiding and just looting all the stuff out of the tombs. But there is really no need for heaps of money in the game besides buying a house which is almost pointless.<br>  <br>  Well good luck anyway.

X6WAOqZOaa	Opinion about mortal kombat its in the hole, Street fighter has been in development for awhile.

d0e64d85e9b85db2e0541f719a3bd08caa	I pondered on this for a while an in the end i've settled on the d-pad on the 360 . the analogue stick is just too vague ,causing too many jumps instead of forward movement.I can now pull all moves most of the time . the 360 D-pad has only 8 directions of movement though,but the "mad catz" SF4 specific pads have a 16 point direction  d-pad which is the one i'm after. sadly out of stock everywhere.i hear the ps3 pad is nice ,but the xbox live experience  tilts the balance -ie no one has a ps3.|`|pcY9Ep2Taa	not i got it today and i think its perfect unless you have a controller that sticks...then its hell but you can do the moves faster with the stick <br>  <br>  YourCuppyCakes<br>   aka:xxXXXXSf4 godXXXXXxx *if i can use sagat*=]|`|rBWm8pPuaa	that is an odd question but it should be pretty clear to you buy the one you're most comfortable with they all end up doing the same thing I use analog cause I've played for years at the arcade machines|`|S65sQGfVaa	analog stick it`s the most comfetable and common.

OQJEvgxTaa	I also looked at the ign cheats and that page was WRONG. Here is how you really do it.<br>  <br>  Akuma: You can set the mode to easiest and 1 round if you prefer.  Pick a character that you can easily execute perfect finishes and ultra combos with then follow these steps in this order exactly.  1. Finish your first fight with a perfect. 2.  Finish your second fight with an ultra combo.  3. Win the rest of the fights without using any continues including seth.  4.  Akuma should appear.  Fight him and beat him with an ultra combo finish.<br>  <br>  Gouken:  Steps 3 and 4 are the same for Gouken as they were for akuma.  But now you have to win your first 2 fights with perfects and the next 3 fights with ultra combo finishes.<br>  <br>  I haven't unlocked seth yet.|`|BLNiwHUDaa	what game

o45Fv5auaa	you cant log into a steam account at the same time. its not a good idea to share an account because if you have any single player games you wont be able to play them when your friend has steam open on his computer. steam reconizes IP addresses and wont allow the same account to be open on two different IP addresses.

ANuVbFFraa	Someone is using your key code.  Where did you get the game?  Did you actually buy it at the store or get it from someone?  I would call the company that made COD4 and tell them the issue.  If you can prove that you bought the game they may be able to give you a new key code.

One of the previously mentioned companies will get any game on it, so there's no point in getting one.|`|KUcM5UDKaa	just by looking at the design... i'd never buy it. then i looked at the specs... i'd never buy it. that's a nice paperweight.
5wWKPlV0aa	Yes, you can save your game to another computer.  All you do is save your Sims 2 folder on a thumb/jump drive and then when you get the game installed on the new computer, you just replace the Sims 2 folder that is there with the Sims 2 folder from the other game (you do not need to delete the Sims 2 file on the new computer, you can just overwrite it with your old file).  This will transfer all your files to the new computer.<br>  <br>  Please note that unless your dad needs the space on his computer, you do not need to uninstall the game from the first computer in order to install it on the second computer.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
xDubataIaa	Saturday most likely. It also depends on how far away you live from the shipping center nearest to where you live. For example, I live in MN and they ship the games to me from the center in PA. It takes at least 4 business days for them to get to me. If you live close to a shipping center you might even get it in the mail on Saturday. They ship with USPS, so they do ship on Saturdays.<br>  <br>  Their shipping centers are located in Los Angeles, CA, Pittsburgh, PA, Tampa, FL and Austin, TX. Like I said, if you live close to one of those locations you might get it soon.<br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  <br>  That is great, you should get your game(s) in a day or two.|`|SQXpjPdkaa	friday if not then monday since weekends companys dont deliver on weekends

x7iYis9Saa	Ah  I just asked this question awhile ago. I read something on a website that to get the achievements, you have to do all the stations in one sitting, meaning u have to turn it on and play all of the same challenges without signing out or turning it off. I already beat every single challenge, so I don't know if you have to do all the levels, or just all the level 3's. What I'm doing is just copying which challenges fir into where, and I'll do all the level 3's in order to get the achievement. If that doesn't work I'll just do all the challenges all over again but just take it one achievement at a time. Hope u understand me and I hope I helped.

(may have some trouble thought its been a bit weird of late). . . . .  www.gunzonline.com<br>  <br>  or serch Americas Army on google  these two are  free to download and play an are great fun <br>  <br>  an btw if you get back into wow im a player <br>  <br>  so if you do want to play can i send you scroll of ressurection or <br>  invite a freind ?? :):)|`|aXXTHpHBaa	The same thing happened to me when i quit runescape.

JwGwUcCsaa	Prince of Purrisa was pretty good.  For the Xbox 360 why not Gears of War and Gears of War 2?|`|7J7q7mq7aa	How about fallout 3 for the 360. It's a really fun game, and takes a while to fully complete|`|BTczpeUQaa	I was asking the same type of questions a few weeks ago, but if you are still looking to buy a Nintendo DS game, then you should think about invest into a Nintendo DS storage unit instead. With this unit, you can download ALL and EVERY SINGLE Nintendo DS games on the internet (for free), and run it on your Nintendo DS. This unit even cost less than the price of single game. Its call the R4 Revolution card. I have over 2000+ Nintendo DS games on my computer now and I have trouble playing them all indeed. Definitely worth the money.<br>  <br>  Check out the following for further details about it. Frankly, its just so legit!<br>  <a href="http://maplegaming.com" rel="nofollow">http://maplegaming.com</a>|`|SSbeC1Xxaa	Any of the Resident Evil games (RE4 has been my favorite so far), Left 4 Dead, Orange Box, Gears of War 2, Fallout 3, any of the Half Life games.

vz9LFR7Zaa	they said that it's coming out during the "holiday season" of this year.  and dude, no its not going to be called call of duty 5...  so far, they've said that it's being called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. but there's still time to cange the title so dont worry about that|`|jxpV13rTaa	it will be titled either call of duty 5: modern warfare 2 or call of duty 5: future warfare. since world at war is not a sequel to call of duty 4 (because it is set in WWII) it was never called call of duty 5. but it should be coming out late 2009. it is being made by infinity ward (same people as cod 4) so it will be fantastic. the reason it is coming out so soon is because treyarch created world at war, so infinity ward has been working on their newest game before world at war was even released.|`|gu0AxKyiaa	im trying to find out what one to get call of duty 4 or call of duty world at war|`|3G7Lpah5aa	It comes out Fall 2009 thats all I have on it.

You can get started for a few hundred bucks.|`|mxdcQBxRaa	Just don't go there you don't understand how much goes into a game. For software it would be about 5000-15000 pounds but most game companies make their own software|`|sVqkIkPSaa	First of all, you need animation and programming skills. it takes alot of time to make a game. you need to be really smart (like me). lol. if your really interested, and serious, e-mail me at jonvargasred123@yahoo.com, and i will help you.
769e50f08cc5813d11f23a96eaac7104aa	okay let me clarify this for you.<br>  <br>  1. if you give a chao an animal you can give it a skeleton dog which will take away the animal appearance.<br>  <br>  2. if you give your chao an animal then it evolves while still having animal parts your screwed, no amount of skeleton dogs will change it back to normal after that|`|ef31622afe2e22cbfa13414f8bbb6b0caa	It should go away eventually.

They are based in Nevada State so it is very safe and reliable, unlike all the other unsafe websites that are from foreign countries.

mTNz8GHGaa	Finding the gems is somewhat difficult, though you can actually pick up the first one right here in the witch's home. Drop down the trapdoor hidden within Melisande's fireplace and proceed into the room at the end of the hallway. It's in here that you'll find a bowl of various soul gems, one of which turns out to be a Grand Soul Gem. Melisande has no idea where it came from, so go ahead and grab it. The other four can be obtained via purchase or theft at the eight Mages Guild divisions within Cyrodiil's cities. In fact, a total of five more gems can be nabbed from the display cases within the Chorrol Mages Guild alone.

But you could wait a few days and then it would change. I mean days as in harvest moon days.
6rAXlNrIaa	You can play games that have campaigns and thats about it.. games such as Call of Duty and things like that. You cannot play World of Warcraft that an online game and has no offline play... no RPGs are really made for computer without internet access... also without internet access you need to buy the game from the store.|`|5GuF9kNtaa	The best game is rollercoaster tycoon you make your own amusment park but if your making a rollercoaster or a waterslide and don't connect them to the ending the peeps on the ride will have a falling and exploading sensation!!!  But they stand up fine right after go on you tube and type in rollercoaster tycoon to see what i men so fun and rated E.
hcYIBxv3aa	Sorry, but no.
6rAXlNrIaa	Well the first time around its sheer luck... after you run into the dog once you can use your pokedex to find its position... and they run away a lot so what you should do is your first pokemon should be a pokemon that can sing and put it to sleep then a pokemon that can take away about 4/5 of its health and you can catch it with a great ball. If you knock it out you will never see it again.|`|xoay6iMoaa	go in and out of 1 city or town nd they go into the grass
93cAUCbWaa	Yes. If you are the host (if someone joined YOUR game).<br>  <br>  In addition to your addition: you can't kill off story related characters.

Too much effort on my part to give you an approximation.|`|0JMOJL3qaa	if its reg. xbox games then dont count on even getting more than $30 at all.. they get a lot of those games and dont sell them bak to ppl very fast.. so from experience.. u wont get a lot..
7Ca2ns47aa	Just as said in the above answer... you need to put it into one of your sim's inventory then go to that lot and drop it there... If I remember correctly, your sims don't get an inventory until after a certain expansion, but I could be wrong... but if so, then it's probably the Nightlife expansion.<br>  <br>  Hmm... but now that I think about it... if it's a community lot then I'm not entirely sure that you'll have the option to drop it or not... seein' as how you can't go into build/buy mode while playing an active sim at a community lot.<br>  <br>  ...You might just be SOL|`|hecLfcedaa	You could try putting the tombstone into your sims inventory and then going to the cemetary and dropping it off there but usually you should just be able to select the tombstone in live mode and move it to a selected lot.

hat60KYXaa	Rechargeable batteries lose their ability to recharge after a few years.  It's possible you bought a used one that was new several years ago, but now it's kaput.  If you can't return it, I'm afraid you'll have to buy a new one.|`|EV65OHUOaa	Maybe in ther you forgot to charge it as you didn't mention it<br>  <br>  or it has burnt out being constantly used<br>  <br>  Buy new ones they are too expensive ;)|`|W4c5Swk9aa	I bought a new one, it works fine, I don't really know what the problem is but I don't generally trust used items.
xDubataIaa	Send letters with a gift attached to the animals in you town. There is a chance they will send you a letter back containing a foreign fruit. Just keep sending them to everyone until it works.<br>  <br>  I could be wrong but I think "Mom" will occasionally send you a letter containing a fruit of some sort. I haven't played in a while so I might be way off on that.<br>  <br>  Do you have access to a wifi connection? If so, exchange friend codes with someone online (just go to a message board for the game), meet up and have them give you some fruit.|`|jYEbbrcaaa	The best way is to get fruit from wifi friends, but since that isn't an option for you, it will be a lot harder and possibly take longer.<br>  <br>  Try sending fruit you have in your town to villagers in letters. That's your best bet, and there is no guarantee that this will work as soon as you do it. It might take several attempts.|`|xIyt4usUaa	Here is a description of how to get foreign fruit on Animal Crossing City Folk:<br>  <br>  1. Write a letter to any animal in your town. <br>  <br>  2. In the first line of the letter write: Hello there friend.<br>      Nothing else but those 3 words and a period at the end.<br>  <br>  3. Attach a shell from your beach to the letter. It doesn't matter what <br>      kind of shell it is.<br>  <br>  4. Then send then letter.<br>  <br>  Do this with a few different animals and wait for them to mail you something back. The mail they send you back will either have clothes or foreign fruit in it. So make sure to send multiple letters out in case some send you clothes. It shouldn't take too long. I got all of the foreign fruit this way.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!  =D

mtsddLWkaa	Yeah, it's a great game to play, and it's multiplayer is pretty complete. You can do the "missions" (called quest in WoW) alone, or with your friends so it's easier, although when u kill monsters in a party you have to share the exp, you can also do dungeons and instances with friends, which basically are places with elite monsters and bosses you have to have a party to do, but u get great exp and loot, and finally u can pvp, which is fighting with other players, whether it is in battlegrounds (kinda like a map where there are 2 teams, alliance and horde and each one has to win by completing a goal, which can variate from capture the flag to capture settlements, etc), arenas (maps where teams of players brawl to see whose better) or just 1 on 1 duels.|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	How much time do you have for it?<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you can't give it at the very LEAST 10 hours a week, you're not really going to enjoy it. Most players spend 20+ hours on it. If you can't, it's going to move painfully slow.<br>  <br>  If you've got the time, and you enjoy RPG's, it's fantastic.<br>  <br>  As for multiplayer, the ENTIRE GAME is MULTIPLAYER. Everything you do is based on interactions with the world full of players, trading, auction houses, group quests, guilds\clans, player vs player, raids. It's all geared towards interacting with other players either cooperatively, or in a way that allows you to be aggressive towards others while still being civil, and not ruining their fun. <br>  <br>  So you can raid a cavern looking for the evil dragon with 8 other friends or players, or you can encounter another player in a dry plains between cities, if he wants to fight, a box will appear asking to duel, and you'll have about 20 seconds to say yes or no. If you say no, then you don't have to fight them, and you keep going.  You can also ask them as well.<br>  <br>  You're interacting with other players almost 100% of the time.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Quests, battlegrounds, raids, instances, PVP, pretty much anything an MMO has come out with, WoW has. <br>  <br>  I played ton's of games trying to get away from the WoW craze. I tried it because my gf made me. It's really fun. It's a good investment. The best MMO i've ever played. It's not overated.<br>  <br>  Get your friend to sign you up through recruit a friend. You'll be able to level to 60 in like a day. That's what I did. It's also got really nice perks.|`|HVoEsd49aa	It's alright, although it can suck your life away, and some find it tedious.|`|yb1KVRyHaa	If your joining with a friend then you might be eligible for the triple xp plus exclusive mount, it depends if your friend has an account at the moment. Would make it much much, easier to level. <br>  <br>  this is the US link to the WoW forum article.|`|16p3jiABaa	it depends on what kind of games you like, if you like other online mmorpg games like runescape or adventure quest worlds, then yes its very good, but check for yourself, they usually have like a 10-day free trial on there website you can download|`|jJJ7Uz9zaa	ITS A VERY FUN GAME! BUT DONT GET ADDICTED! I was addicted for a while to "WoW" but i finnaly broke it =) I am free at last and play when i want not when my mind tells me there is nothing better to do.|`|PQy6if0Waa	It's definitely addicting.. and yes, if you travel along with your friend, you're in the same Server and Faction (Alliance/Horde) and you stay about on the same level, you can grab the same quests and quest together and both complete at the same time.<br>  <br>  It's embarrassing, but I treasure the first moments I had on WoW. I remember the days. :')|`|kthrNyAdaa	WoW is one of the best game ive ever played and i have been playing games for nearly 20 years now.<br>  <br>  the game itself is built around multiplayer.  there are many quests that you do that you will need to get help and will be quicked with a group.<br>  <br>  for multiplayed options you have:<br>  <br>  Quests<br>  Instances (Dungeons)<br>   - Heroics and Raids (harder versions of high level instances that you must be in a group to complete)<br>  <br>  Battlegrounds (player (alliance) vs player (horde) battles)<br>  <br>  Arenas - you can be on 2, 3 or 5 players teams that go against other teams.<br>  <br>  Achievements - some require the help of a large group.<br>  <br>  there is more that i just cant even think of at the moment but its safe to say a lot of the game and the economy in it relies on the multitude of players on it.  it really is an independent world.<br>  <br>  now if you have a time where you dont feel like grouping.  there are still lots of quests and thing you can do on your own.  trust me ive done lots of them.<br>  <br>  you can learn 2 main professions to help your character and buddies out, and also to make a good amount of gold.<br>  <br>  in the end, this game has a lot of content and i mean a lot.  more than any other game ive ever seen.  it really is endless lol.  you dont have to make sure to moderate your time with it.  it can be great great fun but also addicting.  thats all up to you though.<br>  <br>  i hope all this helps your decision<br>  <br>  ps if you do get the game make sure you and your friend pick the same Faction, because alliance cant talk to the horde and vice versa
QHPoAvlvaa	Yes you can make a private room with only certian people E.g your mates<br>  im not sure about doing missions with buddys but you can definatly steal cars, choppers (helicopters)  motorbikes, boats and police cars n stuff. <br>  <br>  good stuff there is auto aim online =] there are lots f options for the games like rockets only or snipers only n stuff<br>  <br>  bad points map is very big for online play gets abit boring if one of you is on one side of the map and you are on the other you digg<br>  <br>  it is great fun thought hope you enjoy it like i do

PQy6if0Waa	You can actually get them all in one playthrough. In the end where you have to choose from three cards, each one you pick will get you an achievement. (They are meant to be one-choice-only, making you play through again to get each achievement... but here's how to get them without doing so)<br>  <br>  Before getting to this part you gotta save your game. Right after you choose a card and the achievement pops up, you gotta shut the console off then reload. Do this for the others and voila, you just exploited these achievements. :P<br>  <br>  Why you have to shut your console off is because after the scene, the game will autosave. Just don't turn off while it's autosaving... that's why you have to shut your game off as soon as you net the achievement.

UoxracOPaa	Tried Rainbow 6? How about Unreal Tournament thats fun? Ever played the Enemy Territory games?|`|q6uyloYdaa	Dead Space is an awesome game but it didn't get as popular as it should have. Bioshock is sweet too, but that game is pretty popular so you may have already played it.|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	You might try Crysis, or it's expansion, if your system can handle them. *ACK!*<br>  <br>  Also, Fallout 3 is a shooter\rpg at the same time, and it's VERY good. The graphics are fantastic, and there's a LOT of game there.<br>  <br>  Additionally, you might try S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and it's expansion, they had to do with a nuclear meltdown in russia, conspiracy, and the supernatural, they were good.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|6MEWrbySaa	Shadowrun!

Why not think about getting a Nintendo storage unit instead? <br>  <br>  You can then play backup games on your Nintendo DS. Its no difference than the ones you obtained from major retailers like Wal-mart etc. Its just the price of a single 'original' game, and you can then enjoy over 1500+ games as well as running music and movies on your Nintendo DS too!<br>  <br>  Here is the storage device, hope this helps!<br>  <a href="http://www.systemgears.com/info" rel="nofollow">http://www.systemgears.com/info</a>

mTNz8GHGaa	Morrowind has a longer main quest, more joinable factions, a more interesting storyline, and more quests. Oblivion has better graphics (sensibly, since it is a sequel), better combat, and is fully voiced instead of text. But it has a shorter main quest, less factions to join, and what some would claim to be a less interesting storyline (It's certainly less complicated.) <br>  <br>  There are different types of gamers out there. Some are completionists, who like to do each and every little side quest and have 100% completion. Some are combat-oriented, and feel pride in being able to go through a game and beat it as fast as possible. <br>  <br>  In this case, it comes down to the difference between storyline junkies and graphics junkies. Some people prefer one over the other, or don't mind sacrificing one for the other. I say that you should play both games and decide for yourself.|`|BrrH8K28aa	The gameplay for morrowind kind of sucks, along with the graphics, but the story to it is pretty cool. Oblivion has a WAY better combat system and is a more balanced game (in Morrowind being a mage is nearly impossible). However, Morrowind has a larger environment. In my opinion, Oblivion is better due to the gameplay, but it is a toss up. PLAY BOTH =)

kvmWDuOJaa	My favourites are Nightlife and Seasons- they are awsome!<br>  Back when I was going to buy The Sims 2, I asked the same question, and the user "Mime Cat" gave me this answer:<br>  <br>  "It depends on how you want to play the game.<br>  If you want to try your hand and bringing up families and taking them through life, then get University. University also comes with the options of locking doors and the dorm room doors are available in houses so you can have a moody teenager bedroom with their face on it. It is a little hard to keep track of students sometimes, but good fun.<br>  <br>  Nightlife is good for fun stuff, and comes with a DownTown which is premade with cafes, bars and shops. You also get people ringing you up and saying 'hey come pay for a meal, I mean lets go out!' and you get in a taxi and meet loadsa people. Also some fun clothing in this EP.<br>  <br>  Open for Business, my favourite, is a one of a kind, with a new shopping district, some lovely designs and decorations and the ability of having your own business, be it clothing, a restaurant with waiters or even a car dealership. If you have pets, you can open a pet store, too.<br>  <br>  Pets. Another one of it's kind and a remake of Unleashed. The dog and cat customization is amazing and comes with a layers system to make your own breeds. Also, with unlockable collars and fur colours it's alot of fun making an unusal animal. Pets also comes with parrots, parakeets and Womrats (never had one, though) for other kinds of pets and some good new jobs included. The Atomic spacey buy mode products come with Pets.<br>  <br>  Seasons. I'm mixed about this. I'm having the issue with snow at the moment and it's not just annoying but completely uncared for by EA. The only way to fix it is to buy Freetime and I'm not doing that.<br>  Other than that it would be my favourite Expansion out of them all. You get ponds with infinite fish that you can eat and stock in your fridge aswell as sell in a business. You can grow tomatoes and oranges and make amazing juices out of them to give you skill points and badge points. There's also the country collection decorations which I use alot of the time.<br>  <br>  Those four I'm in love with.<br>  <br>  The stuff packs are good too, a cheap package of custom content by maxis to put in your game. I'd recommend H&M Fashion and Teen Style. Although Teen Style is what's messed up my Seasons game, so be warned.<br>  Apparantly Celebration Stuff is only a few more cakes. Glamour Life is a nice stuff too, and I'm gunna hopefully buy Kitchen and Bathroom, it looks good."<br>  <br>  It was a really informative answer and really helped me to pick what expansion packs to buy!<br>  You can see the other answers I got by clicking here:<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtmoDxaVnw1OBSWk1wt0S8MhBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20080416141919AAx0gZB">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helped!

Its is the highest rated on any Eps (becuase of the weathers and seasons).

Well if I were you I would try out Fable 2. It is RPG, and does have online Co-op play. It has a great story line, and you basically shape your own character. You can be evil, good, or maybe just a neutral person. There are hundreds of different weapons and clothing to try. I believe the game is very customizable to fit the players needs.

They both have fantastic storylines and have great online play. Surprisingly, #1 still has updates (last I checked). With these games, not only can you play it, but you can create new modules and story lines for others to play. Which means... da da da.... There are countless expansion packs out there for story. If you want a game where you can pick it up when you want (unlike the life suckingness of WoW), and have more play than you'll ever use up, this is the game.|`|V2RNpIFZaa	oblivion, and fallout 3 made by the same company they are both amaing games and i played oblivion for like 180 hrs and fallout for like 52 also mass effect is a great rpg|`|Lf5ErUbdaa	Stick RPG is a popular game and I personally don't believe this but rumor is that they are making a stick RPG 2.

MFHMwJ3baa	I get the point that your skill level goes down if you quit a lot. But they might have ranked up in lone wolves and have quit a lot in a different playlist. For example, you don't lower your skill level in lone wolves by quitting every match in social slayer.|`|BLNiwHUDaa	they went on someone elses 360 and they had like level 40 so that person owned and got to 13|`|FkVMOTZtaa	I know what you mean I went against some1 that had only played 6 ranked games period and no social and no custom games but somehow they had 35 skill in team doubles.

paHjJrrdaa	Yea ya know it does suck. For all of us who are avid Sim players it really is a problem. Ya know, we spend all kinds of money on this crap for expansion packs and what not.  We keep hoping and praying for a new game to come out.  And over a YEAR ago, mind you, they start teasing us of this "Sims 3" coming out.  So we get all excited and pumped up, just for the release date to keep being pushed back.  That is BS!<br>  <br>  Yea, I feel I have the right to be childish and complain just as the asker does.  They have so much of my money already!  Then I go digging up $70 and pre-order it MONTHS and MONTHS ago just waiting for 2/22/09 to come around playing my old boring Sims 2, JUST to have to wait longer.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't think this would have been a big issue if they wouldn't have made such a HUGE FREAKEN deal out of the game AND the release date.  I was getting 3 emails a week about the game!

But guess what, wouldn't you rather want an awesome game with amazing features and possibilities?  It's only a few months.  Get over it.  Don't call and complain...This is a huge thing!  The Sims is the greatest video game ever made.  I play it all the time.  I'm not going to throw a fit over the fact that it was pushed forward.  I look at it as 'oh, great, my game that I will be receiving in the mail is going to be really good.  They put time into this.'  I'm glad that they decided to make the game better.  Especially for older PC's....Just, be happy about the fact that they did make a sims 3 and be excited for June!!!|`|7Ca2ns47aa	Get over it. This happens ALL the time with video games. You wanna be a little b*tch and call and complain, then fine, it's still not gonna bring your Sims game out any sooner. They need to finish it, don't they?! They informed everyone of the push back like 2 months ago on their site. Get with the program.|`|AA12389198	The game isn't going to get released any faster bt you calling and complaining. I'm guessing though if you really wanted to call you could go to www.thesims3.com and look up the contact information.|`|m0tzEMMlaa	Just wait ok. Of coarse they have to fix some problems in the game.

dfcaf140efed90dfce60d1fc015f3d77aa	When using a keyboard I use the 'c' key to highlight the closest enemy.  This does not initiate an attack, just a highlight to check health and level and any conditions, hexes, or enchantments.  I believe the 'c' key is the default, but you could make it whatever you want.  To cycle to the next enemy use the tab key.  Then hitting the space bar has you attack.<br>  <br>  If you are in the habit of using the mouse, if you click quickly to a spot close to where you are you will then stop your attack/movement to the target.<br>  <br>  Have fun!!

Run a search on <a href="http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com" rel="nofollow">http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com</a> & see if it can help you w/that game, at least!|`|pbMnfypEaa	all depends on what part it fails on. if its shaders or dx10 that you lack, then you cant play it at all|`|m4VVsdmWaa	Go here to see specifically if your computer can run the game, it works for just about any computer game, I use it frequently and usually before I make a game purchase.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest" rel="nofollow">http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...</a>

vtJDHJDYaa	Its in PS2 and you can check the prices through the net or even your nearest game shop as their prices differ from each other.<br>  <a href="http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_(game)" rel="nofollow">http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/King...</a>|`|PTovC2Dqaa	Kingdom Hearts is for the PlayStation 2 and it is a mix of Final Fantasy characters from Square Enix and Disney characters. This game has very unique and unbelievable graphics that are used through out the whole game. Also, the fighting style is also incredible when you're controlling the main character. You should really consider playing Kingdom Hearts. <br>  <br>  Here's a lot more information on the game:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_hearts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_hea...</a>|`|P3Fot172aa	The two main games are for PS2, and yeah, the games are surprisingly fun (Especially the second, which has an even better combat system). There's also a GBA game, but it's not really important to the main story, or nearly as enjoyable.|`|x3RAaLfNaa	It's an 8 out 10. It's pretty long and after a while it gets kind of boring. It's also challenging, but if you're up for that then it would be perfect.|`|JvjtcuNNaa	yea its hella fun and there are two games both for ps2.<br>  they should be around $20 brand new|`|aBtPiaeNaa	Very good games<br>  main two for PS2|`|SPgHq3viaa	DUDE!! Your missing out!!! I've played both the first and second one for ps2 and they are AMAZING games! Play the first one. There is just so much to say... You get to fight Hercules, you team up with Tarzan, ou fight Clayton, you go to wonderland, you see Cloud strife from final fantasy, and you actually get to fight him too as well a sephiroth. Dude there is so much more. On the second one, you get to travel to Aladdin's world, You get to have Simba from lion king on your team.. mann.. I don't want to spoil everything. Trust me, they are games that is DEF worth the money.|`|lJyXhaHCaa	Both games are for PS2. I've only played the first but it was awesome, the reason I bought my my playstation actually. Its a HUGE game, awesome play, and its got a great fighting interface but still with everything you love  about rpgs|`|Dy30hAVSaa	yes and the first is for ps2.for the others search wiki|`|ZpB1Ik8Faa	Best game in the world!|`|FApE1XS8aa	You'll enjoy it for a while, but then it gets boring:D|`|rj8arBLgaa	yes its awesome(but hard) and its for the ps2

I think. Here is one I used before, good luck and I really hope it works for you. If not I recommend emailing EA, they should help you.... or go to a game store and see what they can do.

FZteb2aGaa	Gamers who do not live in the US, Japan and Hong Kong regions, or who do not have a Playstation network store normally resort to using Entropay to add funds to their foreign PSN account.<br>  <br>  Gamers who find that Entropay does not work for them will have an alternative choice in Gaminglue. Japan or US PSN cards that are available for purchase from Gaminglue.com can be used to add funds in either the Japan or US PSN store.
lRNAlYyXaa	I think you should read a book|`|M7LlQ2CBaa	It doesnt really matter.. but for sneaking argonians are pretty nice... lockpicking pluss :)<br>  <br>  if you like the game you are going to play through it all anyway :)|`|8i76USBBaa	the cat one is all sneaky.<br>  <br>  but, downside... you look like a cat....<br>  <br>  I just chose the human one. Pretty balanced out. That game got boring really fast though. Probably because I don't like games that require you to put hours into it before your character can do any damage.|`|eCrLwRTZaa	**** reading a book.<br>  oblivions an amazing game.<br>  it depends what you want to do.<br>  if your big on meleeing then go with a imperial, redguard, or nord.<br>  brenons are the best for magic in my opinion.|`|NeOaPs6Jaa	Wood Elf or Khajit are the best if you wanna be sneaky.|`|SuQjgtccaa	Fish race|`|AA10119914	it does not mater what race you can get sneek up or enchant a set of armor to Chemelion get that to 100 or more no one can see you you can also do a cheet to fortify skills if you double click on a scroll you have 2 of then go to another item and drop it you have 2 drop on the floor if it is enchanted put one on and go to 3 scrolls and drop the one you dont have on it will drop 3 and you will have the efect of the enchament permatly then you can sell the items you have duplicated this works great with sigel stones and with items you enchant yourself i know couse i have done this myself.|`|20c0ee5fad0ffb1921a78560f68f591baa	The sneakiest race is the Khajitt.  Argonians aren't bad, and Wood Elves are supposed to be pretty good as well.  I've had a lot of success with Dark Elves, but they're a nice well-rounded race to begin with.  If you really want a challenge, play a Nord!  (It can be done!)
aSq7YLzEaa	skinning and leather isnt going to make your much money, unless you skin some high end materials then it can make you some dough but in low levels only way to get by is mining. You can probably do Scarlet Monistary over and over and pick up the greens and sell them for about 40 silver each, but idk if you ready for that havent played WoW in over 4 years|`|zxE3ZhMAaa	im not really sure im a lvl 24 and i have to some proffessions as you lol <br>  <br>  i only have 10 g lol
KtBfxkNAaa	I've been playing CoD4 since December and I am on an HP that has Vista and the only problem I have had has been the iwp.exe error. It eventually went away, no clue how though.

20c0ee5fad0ffb1921a78560f68f591baa	Locate all the items in the house that make a noise when you click on them.  The secret is to click on them in the correct order, and not to let too much time go by between clicks (it's not a twitch-type thing--you have several seconds).  I don't remember the correct order, but I do know that 1 or 2 of the items repeat in the sequence.  Good luck!|`|87231731cb32c6abdb725130f208078daa	You have to hit the gnome block and nuka cola bottle in a certain order

VQy0d60paa	delete the already made sav. file for that game, and try to play it again.<br>  If that doesn't work, then the r4 probably cant handel it. you could also try downloading the same thing from a different website and try that out.

SWvdcaPraa	If you're just looking for a program to burn cd's you can try Nero at www.Nero.9-Ultra.com. I think they have a free program you can download. If you are looking to download music for free... well, I don't think you can do that legally anywhere anymore. What particularly are you looking for?|`|20c0ee5fad0ffb1921a78560f68f591baa	You're not going to find a free website that allows you to burn movies for free legally.  They don't exist.  Either accept your existence as a pirate, or sit quietly like a good cybercitizen.

lmvG5Sj1aa	Do not ship until whatever the payment maybe clears the bank and it is confirmed the money is there.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	do not ship til payment is confirmed, but i would send the buyer and email saying that you for bidding/buying my item, the item will be shipped as soon as your payment is processed, thank you.   this way you keep them in the loop and they wont leave you a bad rating thinking you shipped the item too late.|`|TEE4sJscaa	Send them an email saying that the items will be shipped to them as soon as payment is confirmed. After all that is done, then continue with your arranged shipping plans and send them an email with all the shipping information. That way they are not worrying about when the item is coming and which mail service it is coming from.
eHXZRohxaa	basicly they don't come that cheap. Nitro fuel is at least $15 any way. the cheapest price you might find is on ebay for a second hand one but if it's $40 they don't work or need some pretty big/expensive parts. if you want one that bad well your going to have to spend more than that. Here is a sight with the cheapest nitros you will find. go for 1/16th scale size. sorry i can't help more! (also try electric nitro is dearer to run,keep,and maintain so try electric, also on that site)|`|zZkbNoe2aa	You don't! nitro cars and buggies range from 240 to 800 bucks.

rj8arBLgaa	just buy one.......
EmH7n1NYaa	I would recommend not buying online for these reason:<br>  - there could be a problem with the hard drive that is not specified.<br>  - They could have taken parts from it.<br>  - Or it could be defective and they just want to sell it.<br>  <br>  It is much better buying from you local game store, they are more reliable and you will not sell you something defective.<br>  <br>  Now for the size of it, i would recommend a 60GB hard drive. It is an averege size and it ist as expensive as a 120GB hardrive but have a lot more then the 20GB hardrive. <br>  <br>  You might think that 20GB is enough but it has happend to me and i ran out of space. so i bought a 60GB  hardrive and had to spend more thaen i bragaind for.|`|TDQdqdh5aa	ebay is more reliable..<br>   i would go with the best bet which is the 20 gig, its cheaper and its reliable. plus who uses more than 20 gigs for games only. i have a ps3 80 gig i've only used 14 gigs so far, and thats  pretty much all demo's
AUCcZ8lQaa	Once you select yes once and save, it will always start lost and the damned instead of og gta4.  I have played it several times and it always starts fine.
