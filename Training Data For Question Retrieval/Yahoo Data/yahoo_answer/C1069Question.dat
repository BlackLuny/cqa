Stuart Clark looks set to miss Australia's tour of South Africa next month after a recurrence of the elbow injury that kept him out of the 2-1 series defeat to the Proteas this summer.    Clark has been ruled out of Friday's Sheffield Shield clash with Tasmania in Newcastle after experiencing discomfort following his comeback to grade cricket last weekend, Fairfax reports.    The 33-year-old had surgery six weeks ago to remove bone spurs from his right elbow and took four wickets on his return to action for Sydney University on Sunday.    How much of a blow is this going to be for us?  Do you think Tait can do as good a job if not better than Stuart Clark?

20090128161430AAftTUB	Sports;Wrestling	WWE Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	Now that I got your attention-Ignore the title as it has nothing to do with anything,    As you know, For the past few years, wwe has had mostly very crappy storylines except for the very few ones that were passed as alright.    If youve ever guessed why this is?    Sure, the bad writers is one reason but wouldnt another reason be caused for the fact that most of WWE's good talent is stretched thin across 3 different shows, making it so that only a few wrestlers are always at the top, which as everyone knows gets boring after awhile.    So, wouldnt closing down ECW and Smackdown and then combining then all onto the flagship show of raw make better storylines as all the good talent would be on 1 show. Making it so that more than 3 people would be in the title shot.    Lets see here people:  Cena  Jericho  Batista  Orton    These are Raws main championship contenders-Theres always at the top of the list    For Smackdown:  Edge  Undertaker  Hardy  Triple H    These are the main championship contenders on smackdown    Wouldnt combining all these wrestlers onto 1 show make betters storylines instead of spreading them all thin and always having the same ones at the top.     Im not explaining this very well but you get picture of what im trying to say

Oh and we are also with 8th grade since there isn't a 7th grade division so I'm competing against them too.  So about the time trials, I got 4th place!  I am so happy for me!  But I was pretty far away from the girl who got 3rd, and they only choose the top 3 in each event :(    So I'm not sure if I get to go to the meet or not.    BUT to get to the point, I really want to improve my time!  Which was a pretty slow 7:18   would it be okay if I trained more after track?  I really want to be faster so I try to keep up with the faster girls at practice.  I REALLY want this!  Do you have any tips?  Please help me!        Thank you so much!

Here are some teams with players that I would be interested in-      Team A- David West, Millsap, Ronnie Brewer      Team B- Paul, Al Jefferson, Josh Smith, Okur      Team C- Murphy, Lopez, Biedrins, Kirilenko, Roy      Team D- Bynum, Harris, Mayo, Monta Ellis, Westbrook      Team E- Bosh, Kevin Martin, Pau Gasol      Team F- Butler, Rashard Lewis, Gerald Wallace, Stuckey, Brand, David Lee      Team G- Bargnani, Gay, Ray Allen      Team H- Jamison, Pierce, Rondo, Deron Williams      Team I- Camby, Billups, Bibby, Vince Carter      Do you see any 4 for 3, 3 for 2, or 2 for 1 trade combinations here? What would help my team?

ASSOCIATED PRESS INC., 28-1-2009 - Amidst all of the buzz coming from the NHL All Star Game in Montreal, the league has determined a destination for the 2010 Winter Classic.  Instead of building a rink inside of a baseball or football stadium, the NHL's operations crew will build the frozen creation in the parking lot of the home of the New Jersey Devils; the Prudential Center.   Make shift stands will be erected along with an ice rink atop the asphalt of the main parking lot, right in front of the venue.  The jumbotron on the front of the arena will be used as an instant replay board for all of the great plays we hope to see.   Surely, the 2010 Winter Classic will undoubtedly carry on the tradition of the previous two ones the league held.  It is sure to be a classic with the skyline of Newark, New Jersey peering down onto the frozen creation.      Dan Rosen   drosen@nhl.com

20090128162936AA8GjPK	Sports;Football (American)	Does anyone know any sweet plays for 2-on-2 football?	My three friends and I like to play 2-on-2.  I know it doesn't sound too exciting, but it's actually pretty fun.        We play one quarterback and one running back/receiver on offense, then one cornerback/safety and one lineman on defense.  The cornerback/safety has to cover the back/receiver, and the lineman has to stay around the line of scrimmage.  There's no zone defense allowed.  The lineman can blitz the quarterback only after counting to 8 seconds aloud.      Anyway, I was wondering if you guys knew any (or could come up with some) sweet plays that my friend and I could do on offense?  Nothing cheap, either.      I know it sounds kind of stupid but it's really fun, and I appreciate anyone responding.

20090128163531AAb2iQn	Sports;Football (American)	How come Marvin Harrison is not getting blasted by the media for probably shooting a man in the hand...?	Yet T.O gets blasted for every lil thing he does(such as the reality show he is doing), which to me, is not as severe as shooting a man in the hand. So I was reading about the case of Marvin, and it sounds as if this guy he shot, wasn't exactly Mr. Perfect American. So maybe the guy had it coming, but your a football player, you lied to the police about your weapon(you said it was at your house, when it was found at the car wash), and you shot a man in the hand. They might not have no proof or they probably do not care because this guy you shot isnt exactly a good Samaritan, but still. You are held to higher standard, guy. I mean this Vick thing, everyone was outrage, like PETA (Don't like em, but they stand for a good cause,but they sometimes overdo it), but come on, this is a human life we are talking about. Marvin probably tried to kill the dude, I mean if I had it in for someone (maybe it was in self defense) than I am going for the kill, if it was in fact self-defense. I mean obviously you would follow a use of force module, but if your not in law enforcement, you prob dont know what I am talking about, but still, HE SHOT A MAN, doesnt anyone care?????

I was doing some mitt work with the coach, but afterwards there was this sharp pain in my lower back. I had this same pain on monday after I did mitt work.

I purchased a sixty five inch television from an online company, and the tv does not work. I called the company for a replacement but they said i have to get it fixed with the manufacturer and they cant help me. I consider this not right since I bought a TV, and it should be a new, working TV. I would like to return this product for a money back..no strings attached! I want to go buy a TV at another store, but the seller which i bought the TV wont agree to this. I asked the credit card company to dispute this matter, and they are working on that. I want to know if the credit card company will return my money, and cancel the transaction, because I dont like this irresponsible seller any more.  What is another way to resolve this issue without the replacement TV?

I can easily run 5-6 miles if I have slept well, say around 8 hours; however, I find it difficult  to run for more than 3-4 miles if I have slept less than 7 hours.

20090225144512AA0f7bH	Sports;Football (Soccer);Scottish Football (Soccer)	Who won the very first treble in Scotland?	let me guess, was it rangers...this ones for you chas.      in 1948-49, Rangers became the first team to win the League, the Scottish Cup, and the League Cup in one season. It was the first glorious treble in Scottish football.      In those days, the early stage of the League Cup was played in sections and it looked odds on that Celtic, in the same group as Rangers, would come out on top. That is until Celtic, amazingly, contrived to let in six goals at home to Clyde.      The upshot was that Rangers' final section game against Celtic would decide who would go through. A crowd of 105,000 packed into Ibrox to watch the cliffhanger. Goals from Billy Williamson and Waddell gave Rangers a 2-1 win and pitted them against St Mirren in the quarter-final.

20090128163920AAdunEk	Sports;Football (American)	Will they're be a larger number of Cardinal fans after the Superbowl?	Let's say that the Cardinals do in fact win this year's Super Bowl, is there going to be a lot of new Cardinals fans than there were last year. It seems to be a trend now that the fans of a lesser liked team (such as the Cardinals) start to pop up a lot more now that "their" team is the best in the NFL. But, since this team is the Arizona Cardinals, a team until before this year, only had won two playoff games in who knows how many years and never made it the Super Bowl, will more fans jump onto the Cardinal bandwagon next year and will we see a lot more Warner, Fitzgerald, Boldin, and James jersey all over the US? I believe that, unfortunately, this will happen. True fans of the Cardinals of course will boast about how they believed in their team for years, and i'll give them that. But if the Cardinals win, i think that all the fake fans of the game will become "avid Cardinals fans for life." That is, until they don't win the Super Bowl next year, then they're become "avid fans for life" of whatever team wins it next year. What are your thoughts on this possible situation. And how do you feel about bandwagon fans?

20090128174523AAHyabF	Sports;Football (American)	Why does everyone think the Steelers are going to win?	Okay, here are some reasons why the Steelers are NOT going to win and the Cards are going to shock the world again.    Everyone seems to be forgetting about the Cards Defense. They be saying stuff like "Steelers have the best D in the league, and Defense wins championships!!" ... Ok, how about the Cards D? So the offense is solid, which it will need to be against the tough Pittsburgh Steelers defense. That much has been discussed. So how about the Arizona defense? Theyre an impressive +9 in turnover ratio during the playoffs, bewildering not just rookie quarterback Matt Ryan but veterans Jake Delhomme and Donovan McNabb.    They shut down the leagues No. 2 and No. 3 rushing attacks (Atlanta and Carolina). Time has forgotten how poorly Ben Roethlisberger played in his first Super Bowl. He completed just 9 of 21 passes in that game for 123 yards and 2 interceptions. Antwaan Randle El threw the only Steelers touchdown pass on a 43-yard completion to Hines Ward in the win over Seattle. Arizona has enough firepower to legitimately challenge the Steelers, and since the Cards defense has been playing like world-beaters, they should give the inconsistent Pittsburgh offense some trouble. With that powerful offense playing consistently, don't expect the Steeler defense to be out of trouble ... please.    Cards-24 Steelers-16

Thats from Nationrail and Virgin trains.      Is there any other means of transportation or train companies I could use that would get me back earlier? Like 2 or 3am is fine but 7 is a little ridiculous.      The game is on the 17th at 8pm and I'd guess it gets out around 10:30-45 with added time and half time (am I wrong?).

World Heavyweight Championship-John Cena vs CM Punk, he may face Cena, I doubt he will be in another Money in the Bank match, so I'd see him somehow getting into this match.   ECW Championship- Jack Swagger vs Evan Bourne-I don't know when he returns but this will be an outstanding match between these two young up and coming superstars.   Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels w/ Stone Cold as Special Guest Ref, this is possible three of Texas greatest wrestlers in one match in Houston.   Money in the Bank- John Morrision vs MVP vs Christian Cage vs Kofi Kingston vs The Miz vs Carlito   Legacy vs Samoans- Ted Dibease and Cody Rhodes vs Manu and Slim Snuka in a great match which will expose these young superstars, of course Slim is older...   Chris Jericho vs Ricky Rourke in a Boxing Match- This is not a prediction, but damn near a fact, these two will face off at Mania.   Battle of the Giants- Umaga vs Kozlov vs Big Show vs HHH to show who is the most dominate superstar in their brand SD!

20090128182437AABLrVg	Sports;Basketball	How many suicides should i do a day to condition for basketball?	i'm already in fair condition, like i can get up and down the court and everything, but i know i could do a whole lot better if i was conditioned better.  i'm in one of those droughts where i used to be conditioned, but then i didn't get to play as much so now i lost some stamina...or at least that's what i think.  btw: when answering my question, keep in mind i'm a 9th grade male.

20090128181811AAd7Xyz	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	How to get to and from the Old Trafford from London?	I'm taking a trip with some buddies of mine to London from February 13th to the 20th. Right now we have tickets to see Manchester United vs Fulham but I'm having some issues planning out the travel plans.      I know the best way to travel there from London is the train but none of the trains I'm finding online arrive back in London until 7AM THE NEXT DAY!!?      Thats from Nationrail and Virgin trains.      Is there any other means of transportation or train companies I could use that would get me back earlier? Like 2 or 3am is fine but 7 is a little ridiculous.      The game is on the 17th at 8pm and I'd guess it gets out around 10:30-45 with added time and half time (am I wrong?).      Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

20090128182911AAwtrIk	Sports;Wrestling	Should i join the wrestling team?! [i'm a girl btw]?	i need help! three of my other friends that are girls are on my school's wrestling team, and i wanted to do it. but i decided to be one of the managers so i could see how you do it and all. now that it's been a few days into the practices, i kinda wanna sign up to be a part of the team. the thing is, i'm super self-conscious on what i do and how i look when i'm doing it. so like, when we do wrestling positions and different types of moves and stunts, i think i look really weird doing it. it'll feel really uncomfortable and awkward for me. my three friends look like they're having a BLAST, and i wanna join in. instead i'm just there on the sidelines, watching everybody practice. there's also some cute guys on the team, haha. and i wanna get closer to them. (: but i dunno what to do. my mom said it was okay for me to do it, but just not to get hurt and all. and when we do wrestling meets with other schools, i think i'm going to do really bad because i'm not very good at doing physical things. please help me!? i dunno what to do.

20090128183145AASi5Ih	Sports;Basketball	Clippers fans and Cavs fans, what do you think about this trade? ?	 http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...    Baron isn't happy playing for the Clippers, Cavs could use a proven veteran pg and keep LeBron happy in Cleveland. The Cavs would become the clear top team in the East. Mo Williams would thrive and be a true offensive threat on the Clippers. I would compare Mo Williams role change to Joe Johnson going from the Suns to the Hawks. DeAndre has a bright future and would be a future co-star on the Cavs. Sasha would have a similar role on the Clippers as Steve Novak, another three point threat.
