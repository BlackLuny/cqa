4fffd99dddf02774cc850be88d03b807aa	Here is a lengthy, but very accurate explanation why USB is technically faster, although Firewire generally performs the task more quickly:    USB 2.0 Hi-Speed versus FireWire  The signaling rate of USB 2.0 Hi-Speed mode is 480 Mb/s, while the signaling rate of FireWire 400 (IEEE 1394a) is 393.216 Mb/s [9]. USB requires more host processing power than FireWire due to the need for the host to provide the arbitration and scheduling of transactions. USB transfer rates are theoretically higher than FireWire due to the need for FireWire devices to arbitrate for bus access. A single FireWire device may achieve a transfer rate for FireWire 400 as high as 41 MB/s, while for USB 2.0 the rate can theoretically be 55 MB/s (for a single device). In a multi-device environment FireWire rapidly loses ground to USB: FireWire's mixed speed networks and long connection chains dramatically affect its performance.    The peer-to-peer nature of FireWire requires devices to arbitrate, which means a FireWire bus must wait until a given signal has propagated to all devices on the bus. The more devices on the bus, the lower is its peak performance. Conversely, for USB the maximum timing model is fixed and is limited only by the host-device branch (not the entire network). Furthermore, the host-centric nature of USB allows the host to allocate more bandwidth to high priority devices instead of forcing them to compete for bandwidth as in FireWire.    Despite all this and despite USB's theoretically higher speed, in real life benchmarks the actual speed of FireWire hard drives nearly always beats USB 2 hard drives by a significant margin (for example [10]). In addition to this, some operating systems take a conservative approach to scheduling transactions and limit the number of transfers per frame, reducing the maximum transfers from, say, the theoretical 13 per frame to 10 or 9.    It has been noted by some research that the Windows PC implementation of USB 2.0 has much higher performance than that of a Mac implementation[2], though at the time of this writing, the study is by now quite dated and old.    In 2002, FireWire was updated with the IEEE 1394b specification. This provides a new datarate called S800, which operates at 786.432 Mb/s, and a new arbitration scheme which scales better to higher data rates. S800 requires a new physical layer, but S800 nodes can be connected to existing FireWire 1394a ports, just as USB high-speed nodes will operate with older full-speed hosts. However, unlike USB Hi-Speed systems, which can change the speeds on each branch, data are sent to or received from a 1394a device at this device's speed (or less if there are even slower nodes in between) and using legacy arbitration. IEEE 1394b also provides rates up to approximately 3.2 Gb/s; however, the higher rates use special physical layers which are incompatible with 1394a devices.|`|7695ed55d377fa852c2f9cee9b87ed01aa	Firewire is slightly slower than USB2, But Firewire is actually more reliable for various different applications.|`|81d2823fe852de3a9083d7aa5570ea01aa	In it's most recent implementation Firewire is generally faster than  USB 2.0.

You can take classes physically or online, self study or take cram courses.  There are testing centers all over the country that administer the tests.  You get your answer (pass/fail) the moment you finish.  Here's a copy of my answer to a similar question:    I got several free sources and a set of manuals from another publisher (I forget the name, but they were highly recommended). These are helpful, but will not let you pass the exams. To pass the Microsoft Exam, you have to have the Microsoft materials. Period. So, spend the money for the stuff from Microsoft Press. A bit more expensive, yes, but essential to pass. They contain CD's with full Enterprise trial versions of the OS, test questions, etc. I started with the four core courses for 2003 server first, then Exchange, XP and the final one... Probably better to start with the XP first. Much easier to pass. Once you have one success under your belt, you'll have more confidence to tackle the harder stuff.     You'll be better off to familiarize yourself with all four core courses before taking the first core exam. Much of the material "bleeds" over from one exam to the next. You'll need a working knowledge of all of them in order to pass even one.   Study on your own.  Either you get it, or you don't. Classes, etc. are generally very expensive and not very productive. (This from a former professor).  Cram courses I would consider pointless, as there is just too much information to remember to try to take all seven exams at once.    The MCSE is extremely difficult. Harder than law school. It took me 8 months of full-time study to pass all seven exams. I hear the failure rate is about 70%, but I'm not sure if that's truth, or rumor

And since it is also crashing while booting up, i am 100% positive that is the case, since no software is even loaded until windows starts and loads it. Did you recently install any new hardware or device drivers? If so, uninstall them or check online to see if there are any updated drivers.     If you have not recently installed any new hardware or drivers it is almost certainly a problem with overheating. You seem to be thinking along the right lines by blowing dust out of your computer, but i would go a little more in depth and get a thin metal object, suck as a needle or safety pin and remove the caked on dust that has accumulated on the inside of your heatsink fins on the processor. also take out the power supply and remove any dust on the large aluminum heatsinks and from the 2 fans in the bottom and back of the psu.    If none of that helps, or it is crashing less frequently, install some 80 or 120mm fans, whatever your case will accomodate. install an intake fan on the front of the case, pulling in, and an exhaust fan on the rear of the case blowing out. these will run you between 5 and 15 dollars each and are an inexpensive solution to high case temperatures.    If you try all of this and none of it works, ask again in these forums, but try to be a little more specific about the nature of the crashing. Such as error messages, Exactly what you were doing when they occured, and explain more of what you have done to try to alleviate the problem.|`|PsuEMkTpaa	Try reformatting your PC...

Please post your full system specs and then maybe i can give you a good range of what amount of power you need. If you have enough power then try doing a complete format and re-install of the OS. Does a blue screen appear when your computer crashes? This can help you pinpoint the problem.

AA11853268	It sounds like you might be muddling up the locations where you are saving the files eg. It is easy to save something into My Documents one time and then into My computer the next time you work and then into C or D Drive on another occasion and think that everything has gone to the same place only to find it isn't there when you look.     When you first start a project, to save the file you are working on go to File and do a Save As. Choose a location that is meaningful to you and create a new folder that you want to put the entire project into. Next time you save that same file all you have to do is hold down the Ctrl key and press S. It will save it to the meaningful place where you want it.     For every other file you create for that same project, do a Save As first. Make sure you select the correct project folder from that meaningful place and save the new file in that same folder. Then each time you save a change simply hold down the Ctrl key and press S as you did before.    This should keep all your work together.|`|4c5a95d6269ec4b28b9fffcd3837f55caa	you need to designate where to save it ex. my documents > web sites> web site1> ect. or where ever you want it to go.

b34f4858d519752a1317ac8de25bb9bdaa	Troubleshooting for most odd problems that occur.    Step 1. Shut down computer for a few minutes. Then Restart.    Step 2. If still not working shut down again. Wait longer before restarting.    Step 3. If it is a hardware component (mouse, keyboard, modem, ROM Drive, etc..) switch it with a known working part. (if the replacement works the part is bad)    Step 4. Reinstall drivers if you have disk or download drivers from net.    Step 5. Use System Restore to go back to when the device was last working properly.    Step 6. If all else fails, back up your files and reinstall the OS. This will put it back the way it was when it was new and all missing files will be replaced as well as any possible viruses will be erased.    Also if you made any changes recently such as installing new hardware or software it could have created a conflict. I once had a problem with an additional memory stick causing my DVD video player not to work. As long as I used only one stick everything worked fine. The moment I added the second certain programs wouldn't work. There are alot of possible things that could have caused your problem.

AA10009034	As mentioned above, you cannot directly connect the two houses together with a single ethernet cable. Not only would it be expensive, the signal will attenuate before it travels that far. Wireless also will not work unless you set up intermediate repeaters to repeat the signal along the path. Be aware though, wireless will have very poor performance results.    I am not sure the context of your question, but if each house has an Internet connection and you are simply wanting to connect the two home networks together so you have share network resources, you need to create a Virtual Private Network (VPN) over the Internet. The best way to do this is to buy a VPN router for each network and configure then to have a VPN tunnel between the two networks.|`|AA10906058	yeah about impossible, or atleast cost prohibitive.    1) server based, and one person vpn in  2) microwave (assuming there is line of sight)   3) theoretically wireless bridges, however the span is fairly short, and would need multiple bridges.|`|d2bb4d20a6144a03cba5dbb043525346aa	The distance between the computers is too large.

The newer Memory Stick Duo is more square. Sony Laptops have slots to accept these. Some printers such as HP have multple slots to accept different cards. Toshibas usually have a slot for SD cards, but not Sony Memory Sticks.     I spent $20 for a 5-in-one card reader two years ago. I've seen 8-in-one readers for $8 now. There are many different types of cards, such as: CompactFlash, MultiMedia, SD, miniSD, xD, Memory Stick and Memory Stick Duo, to name a few.    When using a card reader, you'll connect it to your laptop with a USB or FireWire plug. Read the instructions first. Open the drive and a green light on the reader will come on. Then transfer the files.    Be sure to eject the card from the drive before removing the card or the info on the card can be damaged. It's safe to remove the card when the green light on the card reader is off. Then it can be unplugged.

You also need to make sure you have the current and updated versions of microsoft and firefox.|`|5937c1caba796eb34629b60d89ffb44eaa	Follow these steps and it will remove almost all viruses and malware/spyware from your computer. It will also make your computer run faster.  .  ?I know this procedure looks long, but much of this is explanatory text to help less experienced people.   ?Please do not cheat by skipping any steps. You are only hurting yourself if you do. And you will waste more time. The goal is to get your PC fixed. Completing the steps in this generic guide may or may not resolve all of your malware problems, but in all cases it gets your PC into a known state to help make it easier for me to fix your problems. After completing all steps, if you still need help, please send a new question. You may have a problem trying to run steps in safe mode on user accounts that have limited priviledges. This will only be on Windows 2K, XP, & 2003 systems. Limited user accounts will not show when you boot into safe mode. You have two options, run the steps in normal boot mode which may not work to remove malware, or you can temporarily change the user account to an admin account and then complete the steps.   ?0: Preliminary House Cleaning & Setup    Unistall Malware thru your computers Add?Remove program.  You MUST be sure that MSconfig is not being used to control Startups. Note: That some Window's OSs (like Win 2K) do not have MSconfig!   ?MSConfig Startup Mode   Please go to Start > Run > type msconfig and click OK!  Select the General tab and select Normal Startup.   Thenclick Apply and OK and reboot PC before continuing.  Remain in this Normal Startup mode while your PC is being cleaned of malware.  1: Secondary House Cleaning    This second step of house cleaning may save a load of time later .   ?Empty any quarantine folders for antivirus and antispyware applications. Make sure you do this. Logs could be huge otherwise. If you are a Symantec/Norton user make sure you empty their Norton Nprotect folder guarding the Recycle Bin. Empty your Recycle Bin  ?Download and install CCCleaner  ?MAKE SURE you download and avoid getting the Yahoo Toolbar version. I do not want you to install any unnecessary baggage.   ?Also it is recommeded to login to all other User Accounts on the PC including the Administrator account which will only show when you boot in safe mode. Run CCleaner on each account. This can greatly reduce scan time and log sizes from the later scanning you will do below.  2: Enable viewing of hidden files, system files and file extensions     Some programs hide themselves by making their files invisible in normal Windows settings. Not doing this would allow file extensions commonly used by trojans and spyware to be hidden, for example a file ending in .exe or dll making manually finding it, if needed, difficult to impossible.       3: Do not use Multiple Antivirus Applications or Software Firewalls   ?Antivirus: If you have multiple antivirus applications installed on your PC, please choose the one you prefer and uninstall all others. Do this now before continuing because you will only be asked to do it later if not done now. This does not mean online scanners. It is only referring to full antivirus applications like McAfee, Symantec, AVG, Avast, AntiVir, Kaspersky, etc.   ?Firewall: Only use one software firewall. Running multiple software firewalls is unnecessary and using more than one software firewall on the same connection could cause issues with connectivity to the Internet or other unexpected behavior including excessive use of system resources which will slow down overall PC performance.  4: Downloading Tools    Download the following tools and save in your favorite download folder or create one, for example C:\Spyware Tools or C:\Downloads. ( It is not a good idea to download them to any folder within C:\Documents and Settings.) And then install, update, and configure as indicated below. Do not run the scans until later when indicated. Also DO NOT confuse the word download with the actual installation of the program. You should install all programs to their recommended (by the install program). default installation folders. First you download the files and then you install (if the program requires installation) the program. It is also a bad idea to download and save anything you need into any kind of Temp folder. Malware hides in Temp folders and standard cleaning practices will delete everything from Temp folders.    Download GetRunKey.Zip and ShowNew.Zip from the below links and extract all files from both ZIP files into a folder of their own. You can extract both ZIP files into the same folder. Like C:\MGTools While these tools will run from your Desktop, i strongly recommend that you DO NOT extract them to your Desktop. Please install them where recommended. Do not run the scans yet!!!       SpyBot - Search & Destroy   ?PLEASE leave all settings at default!!!! Install, do the search for updates now and get any updates, then fix the below problem with Spybot default products. If you get an error message about "bad checksum" when trying to update, just choose a different server location. Also look for the Immunize feature in Spybot and use it. Do not use the Teatimer function. It can be a resource hog and also makes removal of certain problems more difficult. Make sure you leave the SDhelper ( IE bad download blocker) checked to install (this is the default).  ?Fixing SpyBot's Ignore Products Bug: Please run SpyBot and get into the Advanced mode by selecting Mode and then Advanced mode. Then select Settings and the in the left column select Ignore Products. In the right window pane make sure the All products tab is selected. Then in that window, right click your mouse and choose "Deselect all". Now exit Spybot. We will run a scan later.  Now if running Windows XP, 2K or NT do the below.

CfbOggXHaa	Il problema  che le truffe su eBay vengono proprio attuate cos. Il truffatore di solito fa spedire al truffato l'oggetto da lui acquistato ad un indirizzo diverso dal proprio (non ti spiego il meccanismo nei particolari perch  lungo). Da qui la regola di eBay di vietare spedizioni ad un indirizzo diverso da quello registrato.  Le opzioni che hai in mano sono 2:  1. farti spedire il pacco a casa tua e poi inoltrarlo in USA (so che cos  pi costoso...)  2. mandare una mail a Paypal e spiegargli il problema.  Calcola che te ne avrei consigliata una terza che io di solito attuo ovvero cambiare l'indirizzo principale del mio account di eBay, ma per le spedizioni internazionali non funziona perch i venditori internazionali spediscono all'indirizzo dell'account Paypal... Infatti quando acquisto con il mio account Paypal per i miei amici, i pacchi arrivano tutti a casa mia...    Anche se non ti ho risolto il problema, spero almeno di essere stata esaustiva con la spiegazione!

7tJZ4mp2aa	I've seen this happen in Windows XP, but you mention Vista (and on a 6-month-old machine I'd say so).  But for reference, in XP, go to the properties of the drive, check some tabs (I don't remember just which one because I'm using Vista here), look for a checkbox that says 'enable CD recording on this device'.    For whatever reason, that mysteriously gets unchecked, then the drive won't recognize blank disks.  Check that, Apply or OK, and try again.    The Vista tabs are different and I haven't had that problem, but try going to the 'Recording' tab and see that you have your drive selected as a default unit.     Failing that, you could try uninstalling the device (in device manager) and rebooting, which will reinstall it.  Just a shot.|`|BkQ0YgP8aa	Just because it doesn't recognize it, doesn't mean anythings wrong.  Maybe you changed the options of what happens when you insert a blank CD.  How about going to Computer and double clicking the E: or F: drive or whatever which one it is.  You could try burning through Windows Media Player too, and if it doesn't work, then it is definitely broken.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	Two possiblities here, first the simple one a dirty laser lens.

Only two cables to unplug and replace it's a 10 minute job. Hope this helps

I Got one a few years ago that said I'd won an international lotter, that they'd selected my e-mail from a list and it won. I was desperate for money at the time so I thought ,"What the heck..l", and filled out the info. They sent me another e-mail asking for 600 dollars to pay for delivery. When I asked them to take it out of the prize-money, they stopped contacting me. Then I started getting more and more of the same kind of e-mails after that.

Qq8Ss9yKaa	It is operating correctly. The noise you hear is just to let you monitor that in fact the computer modem is dialing and talking. That noise would be rather irritating if it was constantly on.  There is an option to turn it off so you can't hear it when dialing either.
eBZdl7Sraa	It would be hard to find an individual person who runs a "free advice" service over the Internet.  They would get swamped with questions, and they would not be able to pay their bills.  Sounds like what you need is a friend or a mentor.    I would suggest finding one in the real world rather than one on the Internet.  Perhaps you could join a club or a religious organization that would bring you in contact with other people.    However, I read from your profile that you can't get out much.  If you are limited to the Internet, then I would just try and get to know a small number of buddies really well and then rely on them.  Watch out for pedophiles tho- that nice 15-year-old who wants your phone number might actually be a 50-year-old man.    I wish you luck.  Maybe you can sit your parents down and convince them that you need to join a group or something that will get you out of the house so you can do some things that are independent of them.  Try bargaining- "If you let me do this, then I'll do this for you... "|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	How about Yahoo! Answers?

I have bought entire computers online but I always buy mice and keyboards from places like Best Buy where you can actually try before you buy and it's also easier to return in case you are not satisfied.  Currently the most popular gaming keyboards are the Logitech G15 and the Saitek Eclipse. Microsoft have just released a keyboard called Sidewinder X6 which seems like a very nice one too. Some people actually prefer regular high end keyboards instead of gaming ones so don't be surprised if your son will want to return it and get a "normal" one instead.|`|vRiye0iQaa	OOOOH my husband and i are HUGE gamers and we cant live a day without our saitek eclipse keyboards. their lighted so you can play in the dark.

3rGkm0rDaa	Try Blogger or Word Press. Also, if you post relevant messages on other people's blogs they tend to return the favor.    |`|01kiBDpsaa	You can in few minutes start a blog from http://wordpress.com or http://blogger.com, but if you are willing to use it in business purpose you will encounter some obstacles from these websites, or any other service where they host your blog.    For example, you cannot use advertisement on the blog and your domain name will look something like this www.yourname.wordpress.com or www.yourname.blogspot.com    Alternately you can set a blog ( downloaded software from http://wordPress.org ) and that way you can have self hosted blog and have a full control of it. This is what I advice you to do. On the beginning there's more work than on blogger.com or wordpress.com, but eventually you will have much advantages.    You have to market your blog like any website, and this is why WordPress software is good - because you can additionally optimize it for search engines with easy to install WordPress plugins (like "All in one SEO plugin" and similar).    If you are beginner use video tutorials to help you with this. Actually its easy, but additional help is only a plus.

AA11525891	Can you be clear on what the issue is? GoDaddy is okay if you are trying to do  it on the cheap. It will be hard for you to get found on the 'net using a do-it-yourself website.     If you are as good as you think you are, hit up Friends and family for the $ to have a Professional site done by someone who will take YOUR design ideas and incorporate them into the site design. A professional looking site will give to "cred" and can be done for under a grand. I know that can be steep but it will be worth it.... PM me if you have specific questions, I or my designer will be happy to help.|`|Xy9YbCo5aa	Well, it is a rather involved process, but I will give you the basics.     First off, you need to have an FTP client installed in your computer. This software will allow your PC to connect with GoDaddy's FTP server so you can upload the html files for your website. I personally use WS_FTP, but there are open source programs out there too.    http://www.ipswitchft.com/resources/eval...  http://filezilla-project.org/     (this one is free, but I've never used it)    Once you have it installed, you need to find out from GoDaddy what information you need to access the FTP server for your site. If you call them, they should be able to tell you the IP address, as well as login name and password you need to use.    After you get the info, you need to connect to their FTP server, and upload your html files. Best practice is to name the "main page' either "default.htm" or "index.htm" - those are the names the web server will look for to serve up.    Here is a little more basic info :    http://webdesign.about.com/cs/beginningh...    Good luck : )
fNEPE2XYaa	Many people are experiencing that, but I haven't seen any solution for it - I have a client with the same issue. I'd move on to something else, yahoo is nice.    http://download.live.com/messenger    see if this link is where you've been downloading from, if not try it. Downloading from the official site is always best when it comes to Microsoft.|`|AA11525891	First of all stop using all caps. you are shouting. Did you try re-booting the computer?|`|AA11118112	Try uninstalling it, then installing it again?  
JKfRtuHMaa	I would recommend against using a free hosting service to sell products.  Most people will not rely on a company that cant even have their own domain.  There are a lot of domain registrar and hosting companies out there that are reasonably inexpensive.  http://www.directnic.com/ is a good one.  You can register a domain for $15 a year and use their hosting that is free, with banner ads, or spend another $15 and have hosting without banners for a year.  $30 is pretty cheap.    As for software, I would recommend using a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) program.  Web Easy Pro is very reasonable in pricing.  It has a lot of good features and is easy to learn.    If you need assistance setting something up, Id be happy to help out.  |`|AA11525891	The reason you can't find your websites in google is that you are not "indexed". That means that you have either not been crawled by the GoogleBot or that you have, but for some reason are either blacklisted or have just not added yet. The primary reason for not being indexed is a combination of a do'-it-yourself website and not having anyone linked to you. You may build the best looking site but without inbound links from quality sites, you will have the equivalent of a "billboard in the desert". Nobody sees it. It you have a site designed by a professional designer (like mine Bright Hope Designs) that links to their clients, that will help you get indexed faster. My designer has had clients show up in Google and Yahoo in as fast as 10 days.    You need good clean code, targeted keywords and phrases, proper use of "alt" and "meta" tags as well as plenty of quality relevant inbound links. Don't get into link trading, Google is on to that one and is devaluing links in their algorithm.    The problem with "free" is that you get what you pay for. Successful websites are not built for free. You will never find one of the big players out there using "free" other than open sourceware that they pay somebody to configure.|`|fNEPE2XYaa	There aren't really any free options that I could recommend, but if you think you're up to the task of designing a site - host through yahoo, it's free design tool is definitely one of the best I've seen.     As far as SEO (search engine optimization), it's a trickier thing than most people think. Chances are, you won't show up on search engines for a year or more without actually registering the site with each one. The how's and why's of it all would be way to much to cover here, but some online research should prove well.    Your best bet for it, is through google, (yahoo maybe just as good), but they have tons of info on how to optimize your site for search engines. And of course you could always pay them for traffic, which if done right -can be very cheap.

GRkCJv8Iaa	As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.    If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.    As an experienced webmaster I recommend BlueHost service which Im sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.    They are a Multi-awarded Web Hosting which offer a Full-featured service only $6.95. You can see their Plan Details accompanied with reliable reviews regarding their service at:  http://bluehost-service.atspace.com    Here I have copied and pasted its features from their website to view:    - Free Domain Forever  - Unlimited Space  - Unlimited Transfer  - Host UNLIMITED Domains (Support All Domain Names)  - 2,500 POP/Imap Email Accounts  - SSH (Secure Shell), SSL, FTP, Stats  - CGI, Ruby (RoR), Perl, PHP, MySQL  - Front Page Extensions  - Free Site Builder  - 24/7 Superb/Responsive Sales/Support  - Free  Search Engine Submission    They also offer "Free Site Builder" that helps you build your web pages without difficulty if you are not skilled in using any website creating program. (WYSIWYG: What You See Is What You Get)    ******IMPORTANT*******  * This service was awarded The Best Web Host OF The Year.  * If you sign up for this service you will have $75 credits to advertise your website with the google & yahoo search engines for free!  * You Can Register A Free Domain or Use Your Existing Domains. They Support All Domain Names.  **************************    Good Luck!  |`|7aqEtfLRaa	0 dollars, if you do it all yourself and use free software.|`|btuYa8AMaa	How much would it cost, you can get a basic domain for about $10 a year, but you would need to lean how to do the web work your self unless you are willing to pay a company to do it for you|`|OCvS8ccwaa	There are some free (open source) programs for making an online shop like Magento, OScommerce and many others. These will get you through the database issue and they also offer some template layouts. If you need a custom layout you have to find a web designer to do it for you. The cost will depend on what exactly you want but usually it is more work than a simple web page.|`|AA11525891	Cost will vary depending on how skilled or not you are, whether or not you use a professional designer and their prices or if you outsource it overseas. I have seen sites like that (done by a professional) run from around $2,000 to as high as $10,000. My designer would probably be toward the lower end.    The question to ask yourself is this. Do you have the time and skills to do it yourself? Don't forget that getting the website designed and built is only 1 part of the process. You also have the search engine optimization as well as the marketing of the site before and after launch.
OySjeHP3aa	Yes.    I recommend Google Apps for domain:  http://www.google.com/a    It's like Gmail, but with your own domain.  And it's free for up to 50 email addresses.|`|AA11525891	Yes your domain name can be at one company and your hosting can be at a second. You could even have your mail at a third but that is unnecessarily complicated. Your "registrar" (the company where you purchased your domain name) has a place where you can set your "nameservers". That is the address of your web host where your website is. It usually looks something like this "NS1.hostingcompany.com" and NS2.hostingcompany.com"|`|Y44qlHUoaa	Yes you can host your domain anywhere you want. I recommend going with Inspirit Networks http://www.inspiritnetworks.com    I have been with them for quite a while and their services are great.|`|Mhaun4IZaa	Yes...    You'll need to change the DNS records for your domain.  It's easier if you pick one hosting company for both your e-mail and web host, like http://www.lbshosting.info You'd just change the name servers, which is just copy and paist two domains from your host to your domain register.    If you need to split web site and email hosting services between two hosts it gets more complicated. There's a whole page of code that makes your domain work, usually your host handles it for you, but not if you split services. Consult your domain register, there are a lot of A and CNAME records that you do not want to mess up.|`|GRkCJv8Iaa	No, No, No !!! When you use a service as your domains' web hosting or email hosting, you can't use any other service for that domain as another email host or web host. These services must be supported by the same company.  http://www.goldpuma.com is the lowest cost service which is full-featured and really works for you ($3.99 /month).  But if youre looking for the best service on the web, take a look at: http://bluehost-service.atspace.com . As an experienced webmaster Im sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.

af7231454c033f712d8460624367fc80aa	You didnt give enough information.    If you have Windows XP, you should have at least 1GB of ram.  If you have Windows Vista, you should have at least 2GB of ram.    Double that for best performance!|`|fd4d1cab288a24bfdab8fbc929a2ffb4aa	To accurately answer your question, we Yahoo Answerers need more info. But I'll take a stab at it. First, it depends on what OS you have. For XP, 512 is the minimum you should have, and 1 GB is even better. For Vista, 1 GB is the minimum you should have, and 2 GB is even better. Now, I have Vista, and have 4 GB on my laptop. That might be a little overkill, but that is how much it came with.     Second, it depends on what you will be doing with your computer, If you are just web surfing, the minimum should be fine, But if you are playing games with high end graphics, editing photos or videos, or have other programs on your PC that are resource hogs, go with more. I like my 4 gigs because I can do so many things at once and it doesn't even hiccup. (so far)    Lastly, this is not the amount of RAM, but the type. Make sure to check your owners manual for the type of RAM your computer uses. Some is more expensive than others, but the price has come down quite a bit compared to what it used to cost. |`|pwkeo7tTaa	How much do you currently have?  2GB of RAM should be enough for general usage.    Computer memory upgrades  http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.a...|`|K0ytE7hRaa	however much you need|`|464xjgAjaa	Open your start Menu, right click on "my computer" and see how much RAM you have.  That might help you get an understanding of what you have already.    Look in your computer manual though and see what the max is, you typically have 2 slots of RAM in your computer and they have a max allowable value.  If you plan on keeping this computer for another couple years then just buy the max, it might cost you around $50-100 but it'll make your computer so much faster.  If not then just double what you already have, that should be more than good for a while.|`|KE8eGCoNaa	2, 3, 5, GB RAM it depends on what you are running a 2 GB works good the more (RAM random acces memory) the faster it is to keep up with the work.|`|68pAMWOgaa	It depends of the type or ram and how much but I will tell you this RAM is expensive!
mr1XoGSQaa	Make sure your Sound Driver isn't disabled; it may have inadvertently disabled itself during shutdown:  Go to Device Manager (Start> RightClick My Computer> Properties> Hardware Tab> Device Manager) and right click on your sound driver and choose enable. If not, try updating the driver, which will effectively restore it to factory settings if there's an update available.    If you don't know the name of you Sound Driver, so to Start> Run> dxdiag. Now go to the Sound Tab and any sound hardware installed is listed.    If that still doesn't work, the driver may have been uninstalled. If so, go to your computer's manufacturer's website and go to the "Support" section. There should be a link for drivers. You will need to know your computer's model, but once you enter that it will give you an option to download any missing drivers. Just find the Sound Driver and install it.

I just had this problem with my new laptop. Make sure drivers are up to date, that you don't have viruses/spyware, and that you have the latest Windows updates. Hope this helps. Oh, and my laptop works fine now. I reinstalled the drivers and updated Windows, particularly Media Player. I have Windows Vista 64-bit and I understand you are running XP. So the problems may not be related. But I hope this gives you a place to start. 
fd4d1cab288a24bfdab8fbc929a2ffb4aa	If you like the tablet PC concept, certainly go with this HP. I would go for HP under any circumstance. I just got an HP Pavilion. Whatever you do, I would stay away from Dell. I am speaking from personal experience. I had a Dell, and I had nothing but problems. My keyboard malfunctioned, my hard drive crashed. In addition, their financing stinks. Their customer service is not all that great either. But if you don't go with HP, Toshiba is good too. (All the above references are to laptops.)|`|f25136f77bb8e33b645c3b0896a24e5baa	A friend mine has a table and he likes it. Just about any HP products are good, but don't buy a Gateway. Their service policy and tech support sucks. 
1zKWEMZMaa	Yes this would be a very good laptop and for its configuration seems a very reasonable price.    We purchased a Dell Inspiron 1525 about 6 months ago also the same config  - and touch wood it has never missed a beat.    Very quite and quite fast.    You seem to have everything you need, but we did spend a bit more and got Microsoft Office software included. It comes all pre loaded and ready to use. But you may not need it.    Anyway best of luck - I'm sure you will be pleased with it.    Regards  index.html  http://www.dutyfreehosting.com |`|X60e8pzBaa	Well it is a nice laptop for what you will be doing.

You do very few things. If not gaming, just doing all this stuff, just use about a couple of GBs of RAM and Vista Home Basic. Reduce CPU. Don't buy an expensive GPU.|`|5Ms2kCJDaa	This is a excellent laptop!  But if facebook, aim, music etc. are only what you are using it for, it might be a waste to get a laptop like this.

Now, you might have success with Dell, but I didn't. My keyboard malfunctioned, then my hard drive died. Plus, their financing as well as their customer service stinks. I would go with HP or Toshiba. I have had great success with HP for several years. I've had a printer and laptop, and my dad has had a printer, and these have all worked great. P.S. Don't add a webcam for 25 dollars. My HP came with one included. But as for the specs (processor, hard drive size and speed, operating system, and RAM), these are great for what you want it for. I have 4 GB of RAM, and my computer zooms right along. 
94c3680a9622b442097bba1b0c8f9abeaa	I highly suggest PC Tools Internet Security 2009. Kaspersky is great at detection, but the results it shows can be quite confusing, Bitdefender is also great at detection but the GUI isn't the best, Eset is by far the lightest, but misses alot of stuff (when I installed PC Tools ISS 2009 after uninstalling Eset it found a lot of nasties) and Norton just plain sucks.    PC Tools, is quite heavy when doing a scan, but for your setup it will work very smoothly.

qrfefTcTaa	Currently the standard processor for laptops is the Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHz Dual-core. So to answer your question, yes it is a good processor, but its not particularly better then other laptops these days.    The main reason they use it though is because its the most powerful thing you can put in a laptop without needing major cooling. Anything more powerful (or has more cores) would require a more powerful and advanced cooling system in order to maintain good temperatures for normal use.|`|fd4d1cab288a24bfdab8fbc929a2ffb4aa	yes, I have one, and it is very fast.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Very good.  Among the best you can get for a laptop (depending on the particular model)|`|5dYrLs45aa	Yes, it is the best laptop processor line available.     Keep in mind that there is a wide range of speeds available in the Core2Duo line. |`|Reus8HNiaa	Yes but the speed and size matter alot also.But as with all electronics they are also going to become obsolete with the incoming core 2 quad.|`|d5bb70ee06990032baefbec0c3967212aa	Yes, because it is not running hot and fast compared to any other dual core processor thanks to its large cache and build material. and it is great for gaming.   but for laptop better to go for Centrino Duo processor with much better wireless capabilities but same performance as Core 2 Duo  |`|ewCxwtotaa	yeah its good |`|lyXJQi3Aaa	Of Course,     I own an HP laptop with a 1.83 GHz Core 2 Duo processor, which is the slowest speed you can get with a Core 2 and it runs quite well with Vista Home Premium.  |`|xzJdCpcoaa	yes its a good processor
96zjzIdAaa	BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH...|`|fd4d1cab288a24bfdab8fbc929a2ffb4aa	I would get a laptop. I don't care for mac, but if that is what you want then go for it. As for Windows laptops, if you really don't like Vista, then XP would be okay for now. If you mainly want it for taking notes, then this OS is good, if you can find a pc that still carries XP. That depends on if you buy new or used. I would recommend new. I had a used laptop, and with as sensitive as they are and as quickly as they become obsolete, a used machine is either going to die or be outdated prematurely.     Good luck on your search. Oh, and sorry, I don't know what a netbook is (as computer savvy as I am. )

Here's a guide for how to do it:  http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/install...    And don't forget that Windows programs are for Windows. Mac programs are for Mac. And Linux programs are for Linux. Windows Movie Maker isn't for Ubuntu.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Ubuntu is a completely different operating system to Windows, and won't understand Windows programs. So say bye bye to any games made in the last couple of years you wanted to play.    The good news is that while Ubuntu can't run things like MSN and WMM natively, there is a program called WINE that allows these things to be installed and run. So, step one is installing WINE.    Go to your command line (applications > accessories > Terminal) and type "sudo apt-get install wine". The "sudo"part tells the computer that you want to run the next command as the computer administrator, rather than just the regular guy you usually are to Ubuntu. "apt-get" is a program that searches a database on the Internet for a program you specify, and installs it. At least, that's what its doing at the moment.    If you're unsure about any commands you can type "man [command]" to get some help with what it does and how to use it.    It'll prompt you for a password, so give it your password, and go through any hoops it gives you. Press y lots, basically.    Now, there's a catch to WINE, and that is that some programs just plain don't work with it. You can check which do, don't, or work kind of with some playing, at http://appdb.winehq.org/    So that's WINE installed. Now, I assume you've got the installer for, lets do MSN easily to hand - for these purposes I'm going to assume its on your desktop. Still in your terminal, type "cd Desktop" (or the path to wherever you put the installer), and hit return.     Then type "wine msn_install.exe" (or whatever its called), and it should install the Windows program. To run it, either go to applications > wine > programs > your program, or in the Terminal type "wine [your program]".    I advise against using MSN on Ubuntu though, because it comes with a very good (I think better than MSN) client itself that can get you chatting with your friends, called Pidgin. A lot of the time there are very good equivalents of Microsoft programs that run without you having to run them through Wine. Kino, for example, is a good movie editing program, from what I hear.|`|2jfnj42yaa	First of all, MSN, and Windows Movie Maker don't work on Ubuntu. Second, you can install programs by going to your Applications list and selecting Add/Remove Programs. Once it opens, near the top is a dropdown list something like Show:. Select the one you want (All, Open Source only etc). Third, you can go to the site of the software you want and checking out the installing documentation.|`|aeSWh73iaa	Hello;    I am sorry you are having problems with Linux Ubuntu.  I hope I can help you.  Linux can be very frustrating!  If you can find a book on Ubuntu Linux it will do you a world of good!!    Installing programs on Linux can be very difficult.  In the old days it was an involved and confusing process.  Now it is  much easier.      Let's start with the easy good news --     If you go to the Applications Tab and open it you will see the "Add/Remove ... " option.  When you open this, not only can you see what programs you  have installed, you can also find (most of) the programs that will run under Ubuntu.  It will take a little study, time and experimentation to learn how to choose programs you want.  All these programs are designed to install automatically, no fuss no muss.  A program that does instant messaging called pidgin is available for instance.  Programs that are not listed may still install, but you might have to do some manual work to get them to run.  For the moment stick with the things listed, keep your sanity.  As you become more comfortable with Linux (perhaps learn from a seasoned user) you might try some of the more difficult Linux installs.    Now for the cold hard facts.  Linux is a very different system than windows ... the programs are not always compatible.  There is a program called WINE (WINdows Emulator) that allows you to run many windows programs.  I haven't ever used it ... you will have to get someone else to help you with it.       The upshot is that it is best to find the Linux (Ubuntu) version of the program you need.  Most of the web applications are as good or better in the Linux (Ubuntu) world.      When you need real help there are several online communities that can help you, one of the best is:    http://ubuntuforums.org/    There are also some good advisors in the IRC chat rooms under Ubuntu Linux.  Chat programs like Xchat are invaluable!    Best of luck,    Bill

XZDjPZUTaa	Hi friend , it seem to be that you have bundle of question so heres your answer .The amount of memory, or RAM, installed in your computer can significantly affect its performance. For example, having several programs open at the same time may cause your computer to slow down if all the memory is being used. Having too little memory may also prevent you from being able to open applications that require a lot of RAM. (This information is typically listed in the program's system requirements). Therefore, it is helpful to know how much memory is installed in your computer.    In Windows, you can view the amount of memory installed in your computer by right-clicking "My Computer" and selecting "Properties..." A window will open with the amount of RAM displayed underneath the "Computer" section of the window. This window can also be viewed by opening the "System" Control Panel.    If you want to see how much memory your Windows computer is using, you can open the Windows Task Manager by pressing Control-Alt-Delete or Control-Shift-Esc. You can also right-click the Taskbar and select "Task Manager." Once the Task Manager is open, click the "Performance" tab to view how much physical memory is installed in your computer and how much is available.    In Mac OS X, you can view the amount of memory your computer has by simply selecting "About This Mac" from the Apple Menu. The amount of memory is displayed beneath the processor information. If you click "More Info..." the System Profiler will open. You can then select the "Memory" option in the sidebar to view what types of memory modules are installed in each slot.    To see how much RAM you Mac is using, open the Activity Monitor application in the Utilities folder. Select the "System Memory" tab near the bottom of the window to view how much memory is being used and how much is available. The "RSIZE" field in the main section of the window indicates how much memory each process is using. This can help you determine which programs use the most memory.   hope that answer had been given|`|TkbqAKcOaa	Click Start, then right click "My Computer" then click on "Properties".

XZDjPZUTaa	First of all friend, make sure that you have the latest driver software for your video card. To get the latest version, you can go to the video card company's web site and download the driver update for free. I would suggest de-fragmenting the hard drive, since excessive hard disk scanning can prevent smooth audio and video playback. If neither of these options do the trick, try upgrading to the latest version of the software you are using to play the movies. Finally, if that doesn't work, you might just not have enough hardware power to play the video smoothly. That means you need to actually go buy a new video card if you want smooth, high-quality video.

With a netbook you usually get a VERY small hard drive which is usually between 8-64 GB whereas the standard is closer to 200-300 GB in notebooks. Also, you will only get 1 GB of ram, keep in mind windows 64 bit now supports up to 16 GIG in a regular laptop so you're really putting yourself in a potion where you have limited upgrade-ability there too. Another thing to consider is the lack of an "optical drive" in a netbook commonly known as a dvd/cd drive, this means you will not be able to install software unless you purchase it over the internet. (But remember you have a VERY small hard drive, so you're not going to be able to install many programs) Meanwhile your stuck with the far inferior "Atom" processor, which is the "brains" of your computer. Look for a good deal and you will be able to find a fully functional computer (laptop) for around $600 that will serve you for years. Also, if you're dead set on a netbook, check USER reviews for specific netbooks you're looking at on different electronic web sites like best buy.com, amazon, qvc.com ect. Many of the people who bought these netbooks are unhappy for one reason or another after they get it home and realize how small the screen is and how slow the processor is. I beleive, however, that HP is viewed as the best netbook over the Acer's, EEE's, and the others.|`|1504ed0aa41d9367f9e3e5ec6d17284eaa	asus  pc 1000---- hands down look on google for thew review --you wont be disappointed

HD7L65fXaa	Mohit's answer is copy/pasted from here (or some other identical copy):    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_trigraph|`|vEqUqlliaa	In the C family of programming languages, a trigraph is a sequence of three characters, the first two of which are both question marks, that represents a single character.    The reason for their existence is that the basic character set of C (a subset of the ASCII character set) includes nine characters which lie outside the ISO 646 invariant character set. This can pose a problem for writing source code when the keyboard being used does not support any of these nine characters. The ANSI C committee invented trigraphs as a way of entering source code using keyboards that support any version of the ISO 646 character set.    Trigraphs might also be used for some EBCDIC code pages that lack characters such as { and }.    Trigraphs are not commonly encountered outside compiler test suites. Some compilers support an option to turn recognition of trigraphs off, or disable trigraphs by default and require an option to turn them on. Some can issue warnings when they encounter trigraphs in source files. Borland supplied a separate program, the trigraph preprocessor, to be used only when trigraph processing is desired (the rationale was to maximise speed of compilation).    The C preprocessor replaces all occurrences of the following nine trigraph sequences by their single-character equivalents before any other processing.  Trigraph Equivalent  ??=    ??/ \  ??' ^  ??( [  ??) ]  ??! |  ??  ??> }  ??- ~    Note that ??? is not a trigraph sequence.    Note also that the problematic characters are nevertheless required to exist within the implementation, in both the source and execution character sets.    I think I deserve 10 points for giving the correct answer first of all :)  -mohit|`|wTYhd5nIaa	excellent explanation mohit, very detailed and descriptive     - I have nothing to add, you said it all

AA11314954	That depends a bit.  For a closed source OS, where fixed binary interfaces are necessary then C is much better.  Things like name mangling in C++ are up to the compiler implementer.  This makes it hard to match function names in the link phase.  This would restrict users and driver writers to a single compiler.    Where as C linking is is strictly specified so it possible for other compilers (even other languages) to link with C routines.    For open source OS, you could use C++, as long as you made certain interfaces C style (i.e. using extern "C" in your header).  In general kernel interfaces exposed to user mode programs would have to be C style.  Internally, the OS could be written in C++.    Yes, you can do that in the closed source OS, but there are far more interfaces to deal with.    As far as better, that's still hard to say.  There are a lot of subjective properties that go into "better".    ** Edit **  For Andy:  There is no degradation in performance when properly using C++, and there are actually opportunities for increased performance.    Proper use of templates allows a lot of code to be inlined, saving function call overhead which would be required in C.    Another false comparison are virtual function calls.  Detractors say that virtual function calls take longer than a plain function call.  While this is superficially true, what they miss is that a virtual call is not meant to replace a plain function call.  A virtual call replaces a switch and a function call.  And with the true comparison, C++ is faster.|`|a5ba9ea46c4e20291c9dc9d53a67da7faa	Making OS meant C for the core, for highest possible performance.

LFWWPgpQaa	The answer I would guess depends on scale.  If you have one PC connected via Ethernet and one via wireless I would imagine sending s small amount of power along an ethernet cable would be less than that required to power antenna sensing a wireless signal in all directions.    On the other hand, if you have 50 people connected to a wireless access point, it is would not use that much extra power to service everyone as it is still just sending radio signals out.    The ethernet on the other hand now needs to send power down 50 individual connections which may mean it is using more.    I dont have a perfect answer as I could not find any metrics on power usage per user on either system.|`|JMY3qn53aa	Ethernet uses less power in almost all cases for both the host and the network device.  The only exception is power over ethernet (PoE) where devices are powered on the same wire.  Of course, this is not an option on wireless.

rNA6x4r2aa	In your link you have "". It is not a static link in that it does not point to the exact location of the file, www.eurodesigns.net/index.html. It rather points to the relative location of the file, which is in the same root folder, as the current viewing page. Because it is pointing to the relative location, you are changing the root folder, but the relative location is unchanged, so the link 'auto changes' to the new domain.

5jMNBO2naa	no it's not  and yes they do put a cap on big bandwidth users  as they do monitor the lines    there is no such thing as unlimited    look at vonage  they set a reasonable limit for the average person use  and then pad it a bit, and call it unlimited  figure most people will not go beyond the limit set  if you do, they simply bill you for the differences at a per minute charge, which gets very expensive very fast    comcast has been thinking of doing the same thing, charging customers per Mb charge on a preset limit    even in their TOS they will state they can change the terms of the service with out notice, to keep their network operating at peak issues for the benefit of all users... and that's all they need    I have FIOS ( 20/20 ), and they basically say the same thing, the difference is that since i am FTTH, my line is dedicated and not shared at the node, like cable is, and hence why comcast caps BBW ( Big Bandwidth Users ) users, where a FIOS does not, in fact they want you to upgrade to a higher level of service as their network can handle BBW with no problem, since it really does not affect other users on the network
zc3BoaWgaa	well make sure that the bios selected is for your exact make and model number   the best way to do this is to select the bios by using your dell service tag number    As far as Vista use the Vista config tool at the Microsoft website to ensure that your machine is Vista capable.    You are probably going to need more disk space, more memory and possibly a new graphics card.    Some printers and scanners do not work    Other games and software programs will need new versions or purchased upgrades as new updates are not available for Vista.    You may find it cheaper to buy a new computer with Vista on it already.

hySRiUBhaa	You didn't specify if it was an internal or an external drive, but I assume it's external, right?    From my experience, a drive that appears and disappears means a loose cable, either the hard drive cable or the power cable.  That would be the solution if the HD was internal.  But for an external hd...it could be that the internal usb cable that connects the motherboard to the external source is loose.    If you're fine with opening up your computer, find the usb cable and reinsert it securely.    Hope that works for you.    ****updated answer.*****  Have you tried the disk management utility in the control panel? Go to Control Panel (classic view), Administrative tools, and open Computer Management.  The disk management utility is under the "storage" heading.

Vcte2eUtaa	For the website your client rents a webdesigner, for text he rent a professional text writer, if he is serious and clever.

If a song seems exceptionally small or big it's usually a virus. If you have any concerns, you can preview the file while it's downloading. If it plays, it's OK.

Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)    Since you're blatantly avoiding  3, at least  1 will make it a lot less likely you'll be infected, and if you are somehow infected with one of the virtually non-existent malwares that target limited user accounts,  1 will make it easy for you to recover your system, since you can just deleted the infected account instead of reinstalling Windows completely.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	NOD32 was Anti-Virus of the Year 2006 & 2007 and close second 2008, when it was pipped by Avira, according to http://www.av-comparatives.org It's very light on resources and fast.   http://www.eset.com/products/compare-NOD...|`|eirkehcOaa	You can try ESET NOD32 Antivirus, it is the best antivirus system in the market.

I was once in your boat and couldn't find a decent program but I assure you Handbrake is what you are looking for.    It does everything you require and ISN'T a trial. Its also pretty easy to use and can take advantage of dual, and quad core etc. so its quite fast.    Oh and don't use aimersoft as it messes with the aspect ratio of your movies or it actually puts the black bars on your actual videos so if you watch it on a wide screen it has extra black bars instead of none.|`|AA10949589	For copying dvds I love dvdfab.. it works like a charm and overrides any copyright codes.

ebuxHnScaa	Your 'link.exe' file is probably corrupt. It could also be that one of the dynamic link libraries it needs are corrupt. You might want to reinstall (or do a repair install) if VC++.    Don't mess with .lib files. They're binary and can't really be edited. If you want to change a .lib file, change the source code and recompile it to make a new library file.|`|vdlg5iD5aa	Try re-installing MS VC++.    It is possible that the file xxx.lib is not compatible for VC++ or not created correctly.    If this library xxx.lib is created by someone else, try to re-download it or get the source files that created that library.  If the library file was created by you, then performing a build all on the library file will recompile the library and create it correctly.    BTW, library files should not be opened in a text editor, you can corrupt it if you are not careful.

lTKuOesBaa	You could try downloading TinyXP, which is legal if you have an XP license. It is designed to work on computers with 256mb or RAM and even less. If not, you could try Ubuntu. It's free, and frequently updated. You don't have to download it either. You can just order a CD from the website, and they mail it at no charge. I got it ordered from the US and I am in Australia.    EDIT: He should get a bigger everything, but that is not the problem now. If you are near Sydney, I could give you my Geforce4 MX440 128mb. It's rather old, but I did test it recently and it still works. It's not much, but it runs Halo and C&C Generals, and it is better than your GF2.    EDIT 2: If you have no need for the hard drive to be external, you should be able to open it and insert it into your computer.    EDIT 3: How much RAM do you actually have? I would think the main reason for it being slow would be the RAM, because a 2GHz P4 should be able to handle it at an acceptable rate.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Any of the above would work fine - XP, Linux, or FreeBSD.

Look on the net for simple tutorials. As long as you can follow a procedure, you can do it. Bit like following a recipe.  Go to www.novatech.co.uk for example drives and PC World to buy if you aren't near Novatech. You need to establish if your drive connector is IDE or SATA. IDE is a flat grey ribbon cable and SATA is a thin job.  If you can buy from Novatech, do so, as they will actually talk you through the setting up of the new drive. By the way a change of OS will not help. I have an ancient PC less spec than yours but with an 80 Gb HD which is almost rapid!|`|6m3PjQicaa	You should get a bigger hard drive and maybe try Ubuntu.

Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.  Go to:http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... get one to free scan your pc    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.    3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your computer.    4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.  Check your drivers. Hope this helps.

pOaE0fWOaa	Take this in stages.     First, take your computer and use a wired connection to the router. This is temporary just to see if the router is still slow. If it is you have a crappy connection fro the cable company and should contact them to see if something can be done with them to improve your situation.    Second, see if you can get a copy of Ubuntu. This is to see if your Windows is the problem. You boot from the cd and see if Ubuntu finds and uses your connection. I would try this both wired and wireless.    Third, assuming the above is not the problem, get a wireless USB unit from the manufacturer of your router. Connect with it. This is to see if the other wireless NIC you are using is connecting properly.    I realize this may annoy the stuffing out of your nag-in-law but remember you are trying to help and are probably doing this for free. Myself, I warn very strongly about wireless problems and tell people in no uncertain terms that there are far too many sources of possible conflict for me to warranty their connection.

Anyway, if you want Windows to remain English then the Windows Russian translation isn't what you're after.    I found the Winamp Russian language pack that will likely solve your problem with Winamp, but it won't work with other programs.  There's not a one-size-fits-all language pack that will work for everything;  each program you use will have its own language packs that you download and install separately.|`|b1e2c3e622f0b58dafa107add4205f3caa	unfortunately, with windows, language packs are installed one-by-one... you cannot install an "international multi-language pack", as there's no such thing.    in my experience, in order for me to have chinese and japanese support for example, i had to install each, one by one... no shortcuts...

This way is easier than to change from phpBB side.|`|JSGJ8nV2aa	You might be best doing it the other way round - where your site makes use of the PHPBB database, so when they sign up on your site, a PHPBB account is created for them. You would need to make sure to fill in any other appropriate fields on the PHPBB user database when they sign up though, just set any fields to their default values. Then when anyone logs in, just check against the PHPBB database. You might need to figure out which session variables to set too, to make sure PHPBB knows the user is logged in.

0FQbkesxaa	Do you mean that things are displayed differently? Or things actually behave differently?  Firefox and Internet Explorer are very different.      Internet Explorer is closed source, so it is difficult for people to figure out how it works so they can make web pages directly for it.  Firefox on the other hand is open source so it is easier to create pages tailored for it.  However, both browsers have their own problems.  There was even a difference between Firefox 2 and Firefox 3 for a while.  I actually had a problem once on a website that said you could use Firefox.  I was using Firefox 3 at the time, but because of the secure nature of the website, none of the forms would go through correctly and I was basically unable to use the page at all.  I had to switch back to Internet Explorer to use the site.    Basically there are just lots of little quirks with Internet Explorer (Along with the Windows  operating system in general).  What are the HTML features you are trying to use though?  There are probably simple alternatives to what you are using.    Feel free to contact me!|`|GuyFz7ybaa	I've never heard of that problem before, my guess is the browser is running in quirks mode so it doesn't use HTML as it should.

In XP or Vista you can just right click on the file and choose Extract. Remember where you located the unzipped file.    To permanently install a font you should go to Control Panel and open up the folder called Fonts. Then go to the File Menu at the top of the screen and open it. There is the guide to Add new fonts. Follow that.    To be able to use a font for a single occasion, you can just open the font file and minimize it. As long as it is there you can use it in all programs on your computer.

Once you have the disc, insert it into the disc drive and, even with the problem you are having, the installation process for the disc tray driver should begin.  Run through the installation process and, once you have installed the drivers, discs should work in the disc drive.    If you still have problems, seek advice from a qualified technician.

It is possible that if it's been knocked, a cable may have come loose, but seeing as I don't have that much experience with laptops I can only help you so much.    A good place to start is to check the device manager, to see if Windows is even recognising it. Step by step to get to this:  1. Right click my computer, click properties  2. Select the hardware tab at the top, click device manager.  3. See if it says anywhere about CD/DVD/-RW or anything connected to those, and double click it.  Windows should either come up with "this device is functioning correctly" or something else, if it says it's doing fine you have a problem, take it to a nearby repair shop and they can replace it or it may still be under warranty, in which case you can probably get it repaired for free.

LHWeXLJ3aa	All PC games install to the hard drive in some fashion. Many games these days will install completely to the hard drive without requiring the CD (Red Alert 3, Spore).    Some games have had patches which removes the need for a CD (Starcraft, Diablo).    Some games have unauthorised No-CD patches available, these are illegal.    No matter what the situation though, it's not legal to use your dad's games, they're restricted to just the one machine or user.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes you can download onto your hard disc but you will still need the original disc loaded to play the game itself.|`|50UbJp14aa	you can install the games onto your harddrive but you will need the disk everytime you play, without it you cannot play|`|fh96XD30aa	you can download the games onto your hard drive so tey play of that but the disc still neds to be in the console|`|c9aBisryaa	Whenever you start up a game it checks the disc drive to see if the disk is present, then starts up the game.    The way people pirate games without having the physical disk is with a image mounting program, such as Daemon Tools. This effectively tricks the computer into thinking that there is a disk there, when there isn't bypassing the check to see if a disk is present.    A common misconception is that when you put a game into the disk drive, it gets the data from the disk. Disk drives do not have nearly the read speed that modern hard drives to, so it is better to copy data to the hard drive and perform the check for the disk, to make sure the person has bought the game legally.|`|35154496dadac252bb1dd3ed057615f8aa	Yes there are websites that you can search your games name and download the .exe of the game and it will let you play the game with out the cd.

Then you can check for running processes by going to sart/run and typing msconfig. Be cautious as some of these are required by the system. Turn off one or two at a time and restart. Ignore the message which pops up after the restart until you find out if any of them helps a lot. You can then turn on any which are needed again. After you finish with this you finally restart and click the checkbox to tell  it not to show the message. You can run a disk check by right clicking the drive and selecting properties/tools/disk check. Turn on both repairs and restart. Do not interrupt the check. Then you should download ccleaner.exe, this can do a registry scan to clean up stray links. You probably need to scan 3 or 4 times, as one lin k can hide several others. finally you can defragment the disk again from tools.

This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.  http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...    2.

Uninstall all unwanted programs and remove junk from the drive.  Use CCleaner or DiskCleanup to clear out the temporary files, internet cache, recycle bin etc.  If you HDD is overloaded and cluttered with fragments, everything including startup will slow down. Fragmentation especially when its been ignored for a long time, causes performance deterioration by increasing file access time and drive activity.

lTKuOesBaa	If you sell it, don't sell the computer whole, sell the parts separately.     What PSU do you have? A 500W PSU is basically a 350W PSU if it is generic. What speed is the RAM, and what brand? IDE or SATA hard drive? Cache size? RPM? How old are the parts? You should include this information if you want an accurate evaluation.    Assuming they are in good condition, approximately:    AMD 8450: $100  250GB HD: $50-60, could be more if it is IDE or a high cache size.  4GB RAM: 50-90, depending on quality, maybe much higher if you have good RAM.  9600GT: $100  Windows: $70-$100  CD/DVD Burner: $30-$50  500W PSU: $30 if generic, $100 if high quality    These are in Australian dollars.    EDIT: What motherboard?    The problem with selling this is that all these parts are available for a small amount of money. A 8450 is about $130 brand new. 250GB HDD's can be had for about $60 brand new. 9600GT's are about $130 brand new. You can't expect people to pay near what you paid when they can get it brand new for the same price.|`|bM5k1RlTaa	< $500.

First thing to try is to boot the laptop without the power cord plugged in.  Does it turn on?  If yes, then it's probably a configuration setting with the operating system.    Is your battery new or used (new to you)?  Sometimes batteries are DOA.  If you can, try a different battery to see if this fixes the issue because then you'll know if it's the battery or not.  Used batteries that are recycled are about 50/50 that they'll work.  Make sure your battery is an IBM battery.  Not some third party made battery compatible with your laptop.    Third thing is to check your power settings in Windows.  This can be found in the control panel.  Make sure you have the correct profile associated to your laptop use, and that it's set correctly.    However, by default, your laptop should automatically switch to battery power when unplugged.  If nothing stated above is solving your problem, then most likely either the battery is bad, or the hardware its attached to could be bad.|`|AA12064167	Did you try restarting it?

AA12352406	I think Google keeps their options open by calling their software beta for such a long time. In particular, this allows them to start charging for the software whenever they feel like it.

AA10793254	What exactly are you trying to load when that error comes up is it normal windows??    If it is run your windows disc through and choose repair.    If it isnt you need to be more specific so we can try and help you.    21/6/06 7.35pm   I dont have a dynamic link library (.dll) file by that name in my windows folder. Im not sure that file you quoted is a windows .dll however just to be on the safe side I would use my window disc by inserting it now and restarting the computer and choosing the option repair and see if that helps. It wont go deleting any of your information on the hard drive its just to repair any window files that are giving you trouble.    Other than that maybe you need to clean out some of your registry keys and programs you dont use. Instead of having to go through all that I usually chose to reformat. Its quicker and easier and a clean start.    Good Luck|`|AA11296572	ok if you didn't got that dll File in net too then it means that File is not of Windows Xp so it's of Program that you recently installed so reinstall the program............. if didn't woked than go to that particular software's website.

Use one e-mail address for everyday web usage and another for clean personal & important use, for people or companies you trust.    Your ISP or mail service may have a Spam blocker you have to enable via thier web based mail. These usually require you to report them as spam and they get blocked.     Get the Spyware and trojans off your PC. They get you spammed. Use Spybot S&D & Adaware SE to remove spyware.    If you built a website and have your e-mail posted for all to see, a bot will scan the web looking for emails to spam.    Do not open mail from people you don't know. Opening them and clicking on the opt out message only tells them you are home. Send More!    There are lots of SPAM tools around but I can't realy reccomend any because I dont get much spam. Therefore I do not use any..    I'm with comcast and they've been doing a fairly decent job. Last year was a different story..hehe A popular tool is Mailwasher.
1c6c07919914b5382364df0b88574f53aa	Even if it were reported, its hard to track who its coming from. Do you know the people who are sending it to you? If not, its just spam. You can try blocking their email addresses. Sometimes that won't work though, because spammers use a variety of email addresses. A full sure way is to just change your email address and not use the old one. If you do take that route, be sure to only give it out to people you know! Hope this helps!|`|863ee16054ed58a87772752a08e0a99baa	Filth on the internet!

You could set up a reporting account as spamcop.net if you want, and follow their instructions for reporting to them.  If they are from the same domain, you can add blocks for them, but other than that, there is nothing you can do.  If you want to find their ISPs, it will take some tools and some digging as spammers tend to forge the email headers to make it look like their messages are coming from some place else.    If the filthy emails are from trolls, former friends, or people who hate you, then add them to your blocks list.  You can report them to their ISP, ie., abuse@whateverdomain.com.  If they are from AOL, then it is abuse@aol.com, or abuse@yahoo.com for Yahoo users.|`|AA10710172	If you have a yahoo ID - just mark them as spam and they will stop reaching you. You can also block the sender using the internet options on the internet explorer.

If your account is with Yahoo, where you are recieving this mail, the first option is to simply relegate the mail, by the sender, to the "Spam"or bulk folder, where you don't need to bother about them.    This can easily be done by selecting the mail by clicking in the box to the left of it and then, when you've selected all those dirty mail that you know are bad, click on the line above that says "Report Spam".  The more of these that you report, the users will be dealt with as abusers by Yahoo.    Those found to be regularly abusing their privileges, after 2 warnings, will be, usually, banned by Yahoo, with their e-mail accounts terminated.    However, the procedure is different with Hotmail and with other ISPs.  So, please do check with your ISP.    All the best.    Cheers    MG|`|AA10150937	You can report it to your spam filter.

Therefore, the actual process involves "Unlocking" cells that you want to retain update capability after protecting the sheet.      Steps to accomplish cell locking/unlocking.    1) Select the desired cell or cells,  2) Press Ctrl+1 keys or click Format, Cells to display "Format Cells" box  3) Select tab on top labeled "Protection"  4) Click "Locked" to check or uncheck as desired.  5) Click "OK"    You can perform the above steps for individual or a selection of cells as desired.    After locking/unlocking is complete, click on Tools, then Protection then Protect Sheet.  Make choices as desired and password if desired.    You're done.  Enjoy!|`|AA11297463	You can do this but first you must protect the entire worksheet.  Then you can actually lock the cells you want.

Rather than waste your time on cumbersome and complicated repairing steps, the easier thing for you to do is to un-install and re-install your Browser.    Judging from your confusion, I suppose it's the Internet Explorer that's your Browser.  You probably have Windows XP either Home or Pro, so here are the easy to follow steps to do this with.    Click on the link given below.  This will take you to the IE 6 Download page.  Please do not download the latest version which is a Beta [or Test version] as it's still under testing.  When this page opens, click on "Worldwide Downloads" and select the language that you would like to use your Browser in.      If you are not from USA and Canada, choose Internet Explorer with SP1 and download it and install it.  It is not advisable for people outside USA and Canada to use SP2.    Once you've done this, please click on the second link I've given you below and, this time, download and install the Java Runtime Environment on to your system.  Most people don't do this and hence have problems with sites that run Java and also have frequent crashes.    After you've done this, please reboot your system so as to be sure that everything is set in correctly.    This should resolve the issue.

Go through all of your directories and files and delete all of the old ones that you are no longer using, if you are like many other people that have computers you will have allot of trash that you can get rid of.  Then optimize your harddrive, this will arrange your files in order for them to load faster and it will also org anise all the files together thus freeing up space on your drive....     Good Luck....

b932ec58f4e07ec83641da0728dd6079aa	You really shouldn't worry about the image showing anything that resembles an Excel spreadsheet.  However, if you're truly concerned, just ensure the image has nothing on that give away the fact that you used Excel.    Simplest way to do that is follow these steps:    1) In excel, click on Print, then Print Preview  2) Resize / zoom print preview to desired view  3) Hold ALT key and press Print key.  Some keyboards show the print key as "PrtSC" or "PrtScrn".    4) Open Microsoft Paint.  (Start, Programs, Accessories, Paint)  5) In the Paint program, click Edit, Paste.  You should now see the whole excel print preview window inside paint.  6) Select the portion of the print preview that you want to use, copy and paste into your document.  (Alternately, you could paste it into another MS Paint session and then save it as an image instead of inside another document.    Hope this helps.    QwertyKPH|`|cec06cbf45366bf49e9d66c29d241869aa	I don't think it will be a problem if you will be using that image to indicate that an operation actually happens in Excel. Eg, if you wanna put an Excel image, clicking on which downloads the data from your page to Excel - then it is okay.

Think through what you're trying to say better and do it without insulting people or being a straight out bigot. You CAN ask questions about race/sex without being offensive.|`|bc0b99cc898886c504c1f156ed801861aa	It's about Yahoo! being a family oriented site, and no one wants to have their kids looking at junk that they don't need to be thinking about.  Sex in general.  I know from friends that Yahoo! will send you violation notices about anything that is sexually explicit or deviant because children have access to the q&a sections and don't need to see things like "Can ghosts really rape my dog in the *ss if I don't forward chain emails?"  When they're trying to find answers to their homework problems.

3673cd99db740e621f1010482dc67050aa	To use a domain name you need a server (either online or self hosted) and you need to set up DNS redirects to the correct nameserver for your domain. To host your own website you need a broadband internet connection with no restrictions. I know companies like Comcast will block ports that are vital for web hosting (port:8080) and so it may not be possible. If you can host it (your ISP is good) then you should choose a computer you can always keep on. Set up your website on that computer along with some good firewalls to keep outside (internet) people off of your network (intranet). Then you will need to direct your domain nameservers to aim at your home IP with your router forwarding to that server computer (typically port 8080 will be default) and then it will be able to pull information off of there. Theres plenty of work to be done before you can actually host a site yourself, so you should probably look into your ISP capabilities first and finish your website completely, too. If you can't host your own website for whatever reason, try looking at http://www.mher.org . It has very cheap webhosting and its actually very reliable. Hope this helps! Good luck, Brendon!|`|298e8a57744a38a2f0a33657d4349fd9aa	Yahoo! Geocities  www.geocities.com you can use your own Yahoo! ID    It is very good free hosting system and should work with your domain name        I also have a service that will build your website how you want it  www.albertcomputersales.co.nr click on Flick Website Design Studio|`|768f0be486a9d842696c6c8078aff153aa	Hey Brendon, most places will not let you use a purchased domain name on a free host,  free host advertise themselves via the domain name like yourname.geocities.com -- geocities is advertiising itself everytime you mention the URL.  So using your private domain name is not something they normally do, if they are out there I would strongly suggest not using them..    What you should do is look around at real webhosts and think about maybe paying $30 for a year package on a real webhost, that way you have more features when creating your website, you will have been uptime (site won't crash as much) and you will have more resources as far as customer support etc..    Good Luck :)

"Steve Jobs had worked during the summer at an apple farm, and admired the Beatles' record label, Apple. He also believed Apples to be the most perfect fruit. He and Steve Wozniak were trying to figure out a name for their new company, and they decided that if they couldn't think of one by the end of the day that was better than Apple, they would choose Apple. They couldn't think of anything better, so on April 1, 1976, Apple Computer, Inc. was born.    But they needed a logo. The first design included Sir Isaac Newton, a tree and a banner that said "Apple Computer." Jobs decided they needed a less busy logo, one that would signify a brand. The second logo attempt was very similar to the current logo, but without the bite taken out of it. Jobs thought this logo looked too much like an orange. The third attempt was the logo that Apple still uses."|`|0166daf9ced1cfa0715468542ac835a6aa	Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were having lunch, Steve picked up a macintosh and said, "mmmmm, apple!"

2fe27d52f0c8b4cee2b272bd8b244bc0aa	Because thieving scum always find a way around such things.  Locking your doors doesn't prevent a burglar from breaking into your house.  Making shoplifting illegal doesn't stop some people from shoving meat into their pickets and walking out of the store.  Putting an alarm on my car didn't prevent it from being stolen.  The problem is that most people don't think through their actions.  By downloading music, movies, software, etc. you are getting something for nothing. But the artists, producers, writers, performers, distributors, clerks at the retail stores where these things are sold also get nothing. Which means less money for them to pay rent, buy food, raise their children.  And don't give me that crap about them being rich so what does it hurt.  If a record store loses sales because of people stealing music, the store lays off employees, or closes. Then normal, average people are out of a job because other people are stealing. They now have no income. What about them? What about their families.  My advice? Get a job and pay for what you want to watch, hear and play.

O orkut  um servi?o com potencial muito bom. Alm de servir como comunica??o rpida, substituindo s vezes o e-mail, ele  um local em que se pode fazer pesquisa e compartilhar conhecimentos, como nas comunidades.  Contudo, todo servi?o de internet deve ser cuidadosamente fiscalizado para evitar abusos e usos indevidos. O google n?o faz isso. A empresa n?o  capaz nem de revelar o nome daqueles que usam o orkut para pedofilia ou para dissemina??o de vrus ou fraudes eletr?nicas.  Foi dada a oportunidade para que o google regularizasse a situa??o. Mas eles n?o se importam se est?o usando o orkut para abuso de menores.   Portanto, a empresa deve ser punida. Uma empresa estrangeira tem que se adequar s normas do pas em que se instala.

Nele  possvel desenvolver uma apresenta??o de seu prprio perfil para uma comunidade global, referenciando sua forma de ser e de pensar, comportamento, gostos, interesses e expectativas.    Ele tambm permite a cria??o de fruns para troca de informa??es sobre assuntos de interesse comum, onde voc pode se inscrever e participar de quantos tiver interesse, sendo que alguns dependem da aprova??o de um moderador.    Reencontrei  um colega que n?o via h mais de 30 anos atravs do orkut, como n?o ser grato a seus criadores por oferecer oportunidades como esta???    Lamentaria muito se o orkut saisse do ar, principalmente porque o problema n?o  da ferramenta, mas sim de poltica de utiliza??o. Contudo, criar um produto e n?o administr-lo adequadamente pode lev-lo a este destino fatdico pelo brutal comprometimento de sua qualidade e utilidade.    Como toda ferramenta interativa, que envolve a participa??o de pessoas, existe uma defini??o crucial a ser feita:    Qual o nvel mnimo de QUALIDADE aceitvel?    O que deveria sair do ar no orkut  a falta de respeito e de qualidade de participa??o e isto  perfeitamente possvel de ser alcan?ado atravs de conscientiza??o e aplica??o de uma adequada poltica de uso voltada a estes objetivos, sendo ela presente e fortemente ativa.    Pior do que a ocorrncia de uma abuso  a certeza da impunidade e do descaso para com esta atitude. Esta constata??o  que deixa as pessoas indignadas e desmotivadas para continuar a fazer uso de uma ferramenta, mesmo quando ela em si,  muito boa.    A impunidade  o maior aliado dos excessos e abusos.     O falecido presidente americado John F. Kennedy foi feliz ao afirmar que..."Eu n?o sei o caminho para o sucesso; mas, sem dvida, o caminho para o fracasso  agradar a todo mundo."    Para que uma comunidade alcance os seus objetivos  necessrio defini-los, lutar por eles e defend-los com convic??o e vigor.    N?o d pra fazer um produto como o orkut ou o Yahoo Respostas, lavar as m?os e esperar que a comunidade fa?a o uso mais responsvel, tico e produtivo dele, ainda mais quando as regras n?o s?o definidas pela prpria comunidade.    N?o h espa?o para Pilatos, para criar e manter ferramentas de sucesso. Sem luta n?o h vitria no mundo das pessoas.     Se isso fosse possvel, n?o precisaramos de nenhuma forma de governo, disciplina, regras e leis.    O orkut tem desistimulado seu uso a muitos usurios pela ocorrncia de grandes abusos como a dissemina??o de mensagens que insultam os outros, espalham virus, exibem contedo ofensivo sem acesso restrito, (hoje  aberto a todos), seus foruns n?o s?o respeitados, recebendo mensagens inteis ou provocativas que insultam a todos, entre outros males, havendo dificuldade de separar o til do intil.    Pode parecer at potico chamar a falta de controle de liberdade o que, de forma alguma corresponde ao seu real sentido e significado.    A liberdade pode ser absoluta e total na sua mente porm, na intera??o com as outras pessoas ela  necessariamente relativa, seu limite  a tica, pois ningum deve agir e se expressar prejudicando os outros ou desrespeitando suas convic??es.    No mundo real a sua liberdade termina quando come?a a minha ou a do outro. N?o h verdadeira liberdade sem respeito s pessoas.     O nome do que tem ocorrido nestas comunidades sem nenhum controle ou poltica de uso voltada  tica pode ser... libertinagem, abuso, inconsequncia, irresponsabilidade, banaliza??o, falta de respeito, qualquer um deles, menos LIBERDADE.    Nenhuma comunidade ser melhor do que a qualidade de participa??o de seus usurios.    Na vida,  muito mais rpido...    Destruir do que Construir,   Banalizar ao invs de agregar Valor,  Criticar ao invs de Ajudar,  Desrespeitar ao invs de Respeitar,  Pensar apenas em si mesmo, do que em Todos.    A Banalidade infelizmente, se multiplica muito mais rapidamente do que a Qualidade, pois n?o se compromete com nada nem com ningum.    Banalidade  um cancer que deteriora o respeito, a confian?a e a considera??o entre as pessoas.     Uma comunidade que n?o d aten??o  ela comete suicdio paulatinamente.    Sem uma Poltica que estimule e de sustenta??o a Qualidade numa comunidade, ela ser sempre Exce??o e n?o Regra.     N?o havendo uma poltica que controle o desequilbrio natural  entre a Qualidade e a Banalidade, esta ltima prevalecer, pois se multiplica muito mais rapidamente do que a outra, podendo tornar qualquer boa ferramenta desacreditada e desestimulante no decorrer do tempo, por melhor que ela seja em recursos.    Estamos correndo o mesmo risco aqui em nossa comunidade Yahoo Respostas, quem gosta de dar e receber o melhor, precisa lutar a favor da Qualidade.    Um grande abra?o !!!|`|2af7cf69060927fee478fe0497073188aa	Acho muito bom que saia do ar, pois os administradores do Orkut n?o tm controle algum sobre o contedo e usurios, e tm uma enorme dificuldade para atender as ordens da justi?a quando necessrio .   Aquilo  "uma terra de ningum" onde n?o se respeita nenhuma regra.   A inten??o do sistema Orkut  muito boa, porm uma minoria de recalcados o usam para disseminar pensamentos doentios, atacar e amea?ar  friamente a moral das pessoas, difundir o racismo, antisemitismo, pedofilia etc.   Alguns bandidos o usam para estudar a vida das pessoas para depois planejarem sequestro e amea?as.   Resumindo, o Orkut  muito usado para fazer apologia a maldade.

00f75be03b26f068d262f69f43cb49cfaa	i have been using HTML for about 3 - 4 years, doing websites. I prefer it to using Dreamweaver coz it has a very "coding" feel. But dreamweaver is faster and sometimes a lot easier! Somethings in HTML require you to put the whole code on one line, is tedious and difficult to decode if there is a mistake.|`|AA10140002	I've also been coding for a few years now and find that the WYSIWYG editors aren't all that great once you find that they insert extraneous coding within your site, especially FrontPage. Of course, most of us started out using it, but once you develop and learn the HTML language, it becomes so easy to just use Notepad.     Personally, I like WeBuilder2006 offered at http://www.blumentals.net/. But that's my own preference only because I can have my CSS file opened and the HTML file opened, and I can also view how it will look by using the actual browsers for testing purposes. But I also use Notepad for quick fixes.|`|822eb360902184b581d73954a86e12d2aa	I have been coding html for about 10 years and php for about 3 years.  I too started with a visual editor, i.e. frontpage or dreamweaver.  I found early on, however, that it was more of a hindrance than a help.  The visual editors rarely produce clean and compliant code.  The best way to learn, in my opinion, is to identify a task that you wish to accomplish and then search the net for solutions.  I have learned immeasurably from free code that I then modified to suit my purposes.  Hands on coding will beat the latest "Html for Dummies" book any day.    warrick@autothemes.com

Everytime you update your computer XP keeps track of the previous image, so you should be able to get those files back by going to the previous image.
88fefecc36fccfcf0f95d4e8f596f56caa	Usually that is used to hide the text in some objects and then you could use JavaScript to modify that value and bring the text in the viewable area of the browser. The page does not scroll because the continer for the text acts like a window and actually you move the windows contents in any direction. Imagine your self watching out through a window. If you move a few steps to the left or to the right someone from the outside can't see you anymore. Same thing here. The reason why that value is so big is to make sure that you can actually hide the text on every browser since some browsers have margins of different dimensions. Another reason for that big value might be the length of the text. If the text is on a line and it is very long you have to make sure that all of it will be hidden not half or a part of it.|`|AA10140002	That's all very true, plus there's another reason for the indent to be so large -- so that the screenreaders for the visually impaired can "read" the text that is contained within that particular indent, and yet keeps it invisible for the browsers, thus making that web site more easily accessible for them.

AA10433196	RAM or Random Access Memory is the memory location where the most current data used by the computer is present. Thus there is immediate access to the data in the RAM.    In contrast, data stored in secondary storage devices like a hard disk or a CD-ROM need to be first read into the RAM, and then sent to the appropriate device.    An analogy would be that of the human brain. If say you are watching a cricket match, what goes on currently is processed by a certain area of your brain. This is the most current data. But, if I asked you a question, like "Who was the captain of India during the 1975 World Cup?", your brain doesn't know the answer immediately. However it can scan itself for the information, and retrieve it. The answer is stored in some part of your brain (similar to the hard disk), and upon request, is fetched.|`|c9c23a7a91ba166cb81c18e48b6c9917aa	I used to know but It just slipped my memory!|`|fe854bf3532665a9cd7f73aa988136c5aa	yeah  ...so?  what  next...

Under the DHCP tab in the router page, make sure that DHCP is enabled. Also, make sure that you have connections open. Usually the starting address for DHCP clients is 192.168.1.100 make sure that the ending address is at least 102 (100 for you main PC plugged directly into the router, and 101 and 102 for each of the laptops).    You will also see a clients table. Check to see if the laptops are registering on the router table.    There is one other possibility:    It could be that the Windows wireless configuration tool is interfering with software for the Wifi NIC's on your laptops.    In the Network Connections under control panel of the laptop, click on properties and advance.

Note i've only tested that in IE 6 and the latest version of FF  http://www.beginninghost.info/projects/0...    And I have done many PHP/MySQL projects such as advanced login scripts, IP Block systems, forums, chatrooms, blogs, e-mail clients, and pretty much everything else a PHP programmer can think of programming.    I also have done work with PhotoShop, but mostly have my graphic designer do the graphics.    Also..

I have had Cable since '97 (beta tester) and ADSL Lite at the shop since 2002 for my buniess. I really don't see ten cents of difference between the two. I don't game so my needs are not split second critical. don't have to worry about lag time too much. Over the passed 9 yrs I have connect over 100 people to cable Lite (256\256Kbps) and not one of them complained about the bandwidth. I recommend anyone who games or has more than 2 comuters to consider the next level, which is usually  1.5Mbs\256Kbps for ADSL or 3mbps\256Kbps for cable. I personally have 11 desktops and 2 servers connected to my cable at home with a dynamic IP address, with 6Mbps\768Kbps. At work we have 3 computer running on ADSL Lite, 256\128Kbps and never have issues bout bandwidth.   If you have only one computer I would recommend Cable or ADSL Lite. If you find that the bandwidth is insuficant you can always upgrade. They won't mind ;).   Lite cable or ADSL will $25\mo. Tier II will run $40 to $55\mo. Tier III will be $65 and up depending o the bells and whisltes you get.

Consiste en una lnea digital de alta velocidad, apoyada en el par trenzado de cobre que lleva la lnea telefnica convencional o lnea de abonado.  La velocidad de este tipo de servicio hoy por hoy llega al menos en Argentina a 2mb, an as hay servicios de 256k, 512k, 1m y 2m. El modem/Router utilizado para esta tecnologia es el mismo pero el servicio de velocidad est limitado por la empresa proveedora, ya que la velocidad es directamente proporcional al costo del servicio.  Antiguamente, aunque en algunos lugares se sigue utilizando, se usaba la conexin telefnica mediante un modem que lleg a tener una velocidad de 56kb/s.

1aacc71bd949f2ae8b5821baef0c25c5aa	Dial up ISP service is the cheapest choice of any of the ISPs and may be a good option for that family on a tight budget. The software upgrades have definitely increased the speed of dial up ISPs, but their speed is still slower than some other options. Dial up ISP service can be purchased from several different companies including Earthlink, AOL, Juno, and others.      One of the major issues with dial up ISP service is how long it takes to connect to the internet and disruptions in your connection. Depending upon the time of day and your company, connection can take anywhere from 30 seconds to two to three minutes or longer. Disruptions occur when you lose contact with the provider because of phone line static, storms, or problems at the providers end. This can be very irritating if you are working online or researching and have to keep reconnecting to the internet.    When choosing dial up ISP service, choose a company with a long track record and software upgrades rather than the newest, cheapest service on the market. Cheaper does not necessarily translate into better, especially in an ISP service. Read the fine print of your policies. How long can you stay online before being cut off? How many email addresses are allowed per account? Is there a limit on the number of hours a month you can be online without additional charges?    Get more on http://www.tehreer.com/?p=4416|`|AA11935119	Some people chose Dial-up to save money.  They are in no hurry, and just do a bit of email.   ( I don't know...

They don't want to pay for High Speed internet at two locations, and wireless is way too expensive.   So they chose dialup, and seek an ISP that has service  in both locations.|`|d1d84975b071165f4685a152e459f5aeaa	Cause it is cheap I agree.

3dc53b62c47e8fc462aa69e45e0db09baa	Yes you need whats called a router to route the data. The modem should have two ports on it one with USB the other with Ethernet cord which will probably come with the router.     I would get a router with two or more eithernet ports. One for the playstation 2 and one for the computer. Then connect both wires into the router ethernet ports and the DSL modem into the broadband port. USB dosen't connect to routers so that is why you will need another ethernet cord.    You can do another setup like this if you don't want to run wires everywhere. Get a wireless card installed on your computer and then get a wirless broadband router like the Linksys WRT54G. Then plug the wirless card in the back of the computer. And put the ethernet cord from the playstation 2 into the wireless router which will then be connected the dsl modem via another ethernet cord.|`|60054622cc15e05317fb3e87a5da935caa	Yes!|`|AA10622802	yes you could|`|59306a636179af446e470a548df36650aa	that wont work u have to use the ethernet port and get a mini hub and you will be fine    you cannot have the usb to your pc  and the ethernet to the PS2    the modem only use one of the ports|`|39e2abb2508158c98413510d47348545aa	Yes you need to buy a router.

Most spyware programs won't touch CWS. Do a search for a free program called "coolwebshredder" or CWShedder. Download it, follow the instructions and do a sweep. If you have any of the many variants it will find them and remove them. Good luck.|`|AA11495466	Hi there,    One of the previous answerers is correct - you are infected with a variant of the Cool Web Search infection.  This is also responsible for your task manager being disabled and may also block you from certain websites that will help in removing it (blocks download.com sometimes).    The best and easiest way to remove this infection is by installing the Free Trial of Prevx1.  This will scan your PC and automatically remove this and any other infections free of charge.

I set-up a warehouse security system using ip cameras and it worked great. i setup a file server for the cameras to record to and installed the correct software for the job.    once i had done this, i walked out the yard and commected to the net using my laptop and gprs card and attempted to view the cameras. all i got was bad distorted images. i connected to the file server and was able to remote view the cameras with a 2 second delay. this sorted out my issue and i went on my merry way. i then discovered that the images being transmitted were encoded and could only be opened and viewed using the right copy protected codec. once this was installed it all worked fine.    you might find that your cameras are feeding copy protected images and you can't view them remotly i would advise you to contact the manufacturor and see if this is the case.    Hope this helps.

Then create new (additional)profiles (preferred networks) using a different SSID from the router. Mark the network as Adhoc and you should be able to connect and use microsoft networking across the wireless connection.|`|0325cd0387e015caa261895b27c65da8aa	If both laptops have an ethernet port that accepts a RJ45 connector, you can pickup a crossover cable for a couple of dollars, and connect them to each other directly. Looks for a CAT5 or CAT6 crossover ethernet cable in Radio Shack or Wal-Mart. You'll find that the speed of the connection is MUCH faster between the two compared to wireless access via the router.

fbf1a06db7b8c1ab595bfe368db03e8eaa	Not too well.  It can't join the domain, so you are screwed there.  It can attach to SMB shares so you can use them in that capacity but you will have issues and will probably have to turn the Microsoft security down to get it to work.    I don't know for sure, but I think they can VPN to a PPTP VPN.  If not you can find a client somewhere that should do it.  That shouldn't be a big deal.    They don't do RDP or Terminal Services either.  You can work around it with one of the VNCs but that creates other security problems and it sucks next to RDP.    I work on both.  If you are thinking of doing a mixed network you are in for some real headaches.  I am not a big Mac fan because they just don't play real nice with non-Mac networks.  You can use Exchange but some things like RDP over HTTP don't work and it really is easier to just use the web site.      My other big objection is price.  You pay about $1000 too much for the same hardware.  Your site licenses for software won't apply and you will not be able to run most things at all.  The only thing they have going at all is the lack of viruses and that is because the virus writers go for market share the same as software developers, not that they are really more secure.|`|AA11018224	If you have window based  o/s than you can connect to the window server.when you connect to a VPN means your  system is business system.Yes it has the capacity of remote access.Mostly Porn web babe used this  tools.|`|8a3b752372f3f1ad9c2c56ce2c8f12efaa	yes

AA10700604	Hello Photography,    iMacs are great, and no they don't break easily.  Sorry.    OK here's my list of things I like about the Macintosh over Windows.  I'm sorry that it is so long, but that's how it goes.    *  No computer viruses.    You hear from the Windows people that it's because there are fewer Macs out there, but I think it's because of the Mac OS and it's Unix kernel.  That doesn't explain why Vista got viruses before it was officially released.  The Macintosh comes out of the box as a closed system.  If you want it to be networked and remotely operated, you can make that happen, but you have to change it's settings first.  Windows machines come out of the box as an open system.  That's so the IT guy can set up the hardware, attach it to the company's network, and install the software remotely from the comfort of his own desk.      If you want to install any kind of software onto your Mac, you first need to type in your administrative password.  There is no auto-install for a virus to attach itself to your Mac without your Okay.  That is the simple answer why there hasn't been any viruses for the Macintosh in the past 6 years.  Another is that first year programmers learn how to create simple Windows script viruses their first year of class.  Mac programmers simply love their computers and have no desire to create such an abomination.  We love our Mac programmers and happily pay what ever they ask for their good, hard work.    *  Games.    I enjoy the games that I play on my Mac, but It's true that there simply aren't as many games out there for the Mac as Windows.  Hopefully, with the Mac now using an Intel processor, we will start to see more games being developed for the Mac.  But, honestly, don't most people simply get their gaming fix by playing with video game consoles (such as NES, PS, Wii, or XBox) anyway, rather than playing games on their computers?    *  Software.    There is a lot more software for the Macintosh now, than before Mac OS X arrived.  Much of the Mac's new software is simply Unix ports.  There is also a large open source and public domain/shareware development community that has been supporting the Mac OS.    http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/    You can actually run Unix X-windows on your Macintosh now too.  Apple has been designated as the largest distributor of Unix in the world.  If you have one of the new Intel-based Macs you can now run Windows programs natively using a program called BootCamp.  There is also a Java Virtual Machine for the Mac too.    There's still a ton of programs made specifically for the Mac.  Most of these are programmed in C or machine language, so they're lightening fast.  Apple watches over their developers closely, to make sure everything runs like it's supposed to; that it runs the Macintosh way.  There's also a lot of Windows ports too.  I use Microsoft Office on my Mac at work all the time. Although the Macintosh versions of Windows software are way behind in features than their Windows brethren, the Macintosh programs seem to run better, faster and are not as susceptible to problems as the Windows ports.  Go figure!    Where the Macintosh really shines is in the creative software area.  I'm a printer, so I know that the Macintosh pioneered desktop publishing.  I think that most structured drawing, paint/graphics, and music programs got their start here too.  Video and film editing and production is now very big on the Mac.  Many people complain about how expensive some of these programs are, but frankly, professional programs are always more expensive than the cheaper consumer-level programs that are out there.  Stuff like iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, etc. come free with your Macintosh, while other programs are quite affordable.    http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx    *  Less problems  The Macintosh simply works.  There really isn't very many problems using a Mac compared to a Windows PC.  Check out the computer questions here on Yahoo! Answers.  There are a lot of Windows,  "Why can't I get this to work?" questions here.  Even though there are a lot of Mac users here, there doesn't seem to be very many Mac questions.  Right, it's because the Macintosh is a little more proprietary and you really need to buy hardware that tells you that it's Mac compatible.  You can't just buy some cheap hardware, piece it together, and make a Mac, like you can with some PCs.  But, then, you don't have Plug-and-Pray either.  The Mac simply works.    *  Mac OS X  It's a very simple, basic, easy-to-use OS.  It's highly graphic, so your kids or your grandmother could learn to use it, and it's also got a terminal, so the geekiest guy can enjoy using it to it's fullest extent.  Windows users will recognize many of the same features that they use on their OS, but there are a few things that are strictly Macintosh.      http://www.apple.com/support/switch101/  http://www.apple.com/support/mac101/    I have loved it because it's always responsive.  You throw in a CD and the icon for it pops up on the desktop along with a dialog box asking if you want a specific program to use with it.  There's no need to search for drives.  If it's a music CD, iTunes launches to play it.  If you plug in your digital camera iPhoto launches to import the pictures.    If you're looking for a file buried deep inside your Macintosh file structure, you can use Spotlight and it might find the file before you're done typing the first three letters of the name.    --Rick|`|51be53f503a69ec96048cb82a043335baa	From a completely unbiased computer user:  It all really depends on which OS you like. Windows or Mac.  If you work at a business or already have valuable software for Windows already, you should get a regular computer.  If this computer is for personal use and don't need any extra software that's Windows only, go iMac.    iMacs do not break easily.  I've had mine for several months and have moved it several times [once during a long car ride] and it's fine.  My friend has had his for a while now and has brought it to countless parties without it breaking.    Hope that helped.

If your using Internet Explorer, go to Tools - Options and delete your files. You can also lower your cache size so you dont hold so many files on your PC.
AA11018224	Some of the down loaded program has no certificate,so it will shows run time error,and while downloading from Internet,some files are hijacked or corrupt.Allow Active Ex to run on your Internet explorer browser,which is most safe for downloading any program.Window always care for your computer and bring to you a warning ! If the program is not responding.

Your sales page would have your PayPal button, or other means of collecting payment via a credit card.     Once the purchase is made, they will need to be taken to a "Thank You" page. This is the page where you would then Thank them for making their purchase, and have the links to the downloadable product available on this page for them to download. You could also create a separate directory on your server just for the ThankYou page, and password that directory, and offer the "password" on the thankyou page to allow the paid customer to make the download.

La extensin m4a ha sido popularizada por Apple quien inici el uso de la extensin ".m4a" en su software "iTunes" y en sus populares reproductores de audio "iPod" para distinguir entre archivos MPEG-4 de audio y video. Actualmente la mayora del software que soporta el estndar MPEG-4 reproduce archivos con la extensin ".m4a". La mayora de los archivos ".m4a" disponibles han sido creados usando el formato AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), pero otros archivos en formatos como "Apple Lossless" y ".mp3" pueden ser incluidos en un archivo ".m4a".    Normalmente se puede cambiar, de manera segura, la extensin de los archivos de audio ".mp4" a ".m4a" y viceversa para poder ser reproducidos en casi cualquier reproductor de audio.    MPEG4 es un cdec estndar internacional de vdeo creado especialmente para la web. Es un algoritmo de compresin que codifica datos audio vdeo optimizando su calidad de almacenamiento, codificacin y distribucin en redes. Con las cmaras de hoy, se integra captura y codificacin en una sola accin, lo que optima la potencialidad del usuario para emitir.    Tambin se le llama incorrectamente Mp4 a reproductores porttiles que cuentan con una pantalla capaz de reproducir videos e imgenes. Esto es en realidad una estrategia de mercadotecnia que intenta dar la sensacin al consumidor de que un reproductor Mp4 es superior a un reproductor de Mp3 por la simple y lgica superioridad numrica del nombre del primero. Sin embargo, a estos reproductores se les denomina MP4 porque tienden a reproducir videos en formato MPEG-4, como AMV.|`|927833160e0f5c2ba7cc0fbe077a400baa	Son videos comprimidos (esta super cool no?)|`|9af41efdc282a2c1fa1ead9c2ea0a086aa	mp4 significa MPEG-4 y almacena diferentes tipos de datos, desde msica a imgenes, y la idea es intentar ser un formato nico, en el que se podran incluso almacenar datos de diferentes tipos en un mismo archivo.

AA10140002	You would be better off in asking for a website review when your website is completed. It's not a good idea to put a website up with so many pages unfinished yet. If this is your first attempt, I can understand how you might want opinions, however, it looks too unfinished.    But if you still want a review, here goes:  1.  Visually your website is not very appealing and looks incomplete the way it is. There are no colors or anything to grab your viewer's attention....no headline, etc. The graphic header at the top is ok, except the graphic of MicroSoft's little window is copyrighted and you probably shouldn't be using it.     2. The whole thing should be centered, or made to take up the whole window (liquid layout) without so much white space on the right.    3. Your navigation area at the top needs improvement.    3. There is no content, only links to unfinished pages.    Upon looking at your code, and validating it with the W3C, (http://validator.w3.org/) you came up with 11 errors. You might want to correct these.    1. There is no DocType, or the one you have there isn't correct. It's missing something. Check this out for the recommended DTDs to use.http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-l...    2. Your CSS coding should be in a separate file and called from the HTML doc.   Sample:     3. All the  codes should be formatted via the CSS.    It's a start. Good luck.

b932ec58f4e07ec83641da0728dd6079aa	Acrobat can be a real pain when all you have is the free reader version.  At best, it will allow you to select the text only, most likely, space delimited.  (A single space between numbers.)  It will have no formatting.  However, it can be useful especially when compared to re typing the whole lot.    Use the text selecting tool in Acrobat Reader.  Copy the text into Notepad (Start, Programs, Accessories, Notepad).  When in Notepad, make sure you have word wrap turned OFF.  Its under Format pull down.    After paste into Notepad, check your rows to ensure that line breaks occur at same point as the data did when appearing in rows within Acrobat Reader.  If they do not, then you can either insert them manually (Enter Key) or you can copy and paste one row at a time.  Your choice.    Once you have all the data in Notepad, save the file in your local "My Documents" as a text file (extension ".txt").  You're now ready to import data into Excel.    Open Excel, click on Data, Get External Data, Import Text File.  Navigate to you text file, highlight and click Import button.  Follow the windows that appear.  There are three steps to go through;    1) Choose "Delimited"  2) Choose "Space"  3) Leave all columns as "General"  4) Click Finish    Now you should see all your numbers in Excel!

Once you've plugged in the monitor to your laptop and plug the power cord from the monitor to your wall socket (and powered on), you will need to instruct the laptop that you're using an external monitor.  On most laptop keyboards, you will find an small symbol denoting switching of laptop screen and an external monitor, and often requires a sequence of keys (e.g. holding down the "Fn" key and hitting one of F1-12 keys).

AA11584143	Information About pdll.dll from Symantec:    Discovered: September 13, 2006  Updated: February 13, 2007 12:58:53 PM  Type: Trojan Horse  Systems Affected: Windows 2000, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP      When Infostealer.Uprungam.B is executed, it performs the following actions:       1. Creates the following files:              * %ProgramFiles%\Windows Media Player\svchost.exe            * %System%\pdll.dll                Note:            * %ProgramFiles% is a variable that refers to the program files folder. By default, this is C:\Program Files.            * %System% is a variable that refers to the System folder. By default this is C:\Windows\System (Windows 95/98/Me), C:\Winnt\System32 (Windows NT/2000), or C:\Windows\System32 (Windows XP).       2. Appends the path to the Trojan to the value:          "userinit" = "[ORIGINAL VALUE],%ProgramFiles%\Windows Media Player\svchost.exe"          in the following registry subkey:          HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wi... NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon       3. Monitors Internet Explorer and checks for the following the URL:          [https://]runup.com.tw/member_account_pas...       4. Retrieves the values that are input into the password fields.       5. Logs keystrokes and mouse activity.       6. Steals the item password used in the online game. Item passwords are related to items, such as weapons or currency in some roleplaying games.       7. Sends the stolen information to a predetermined email address.       8. Ends the following processes, some of which are security-related:              * RavMon.exe            * Ravmond.EXE            * IPARMOR.EXE            * adam.exe            * EGHOST.EXE            * MAILMON.EXE            * KAVPFW.EXE       9. Searches for a dialog box that has the following window class name:          AVP.AlertDialog      10. Pushes a button on the dialog box to ignore the warning by the security-related product, if found.      11. May also download and execute a remote file, such as updates of itself.        Recommendations    Symantec Security Response encourages all users and administrators to adhere to the following basic security "best practices":        * Turn off and remove unneeded services. By default, many operating systems install auxiliary services that are not critical, such as an FTP server, telnet, and a Web server. These services are avenues of attack. If they are removed, blended threats have less avenues of attack and you have fewer services to maintain through patch updates.      * If a blended threat exploits one or more network services, disable, or block access to, those services until a patch is applied.      * Always keep your patch levels up-to-date, especially on computers that host public services and are accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services (for example, all Windows-based computers should have the current Service Pack installed.). Additionally, please apply any security updates that are mentioned in this writeup, in trusted Security Bulletins, or on vendor Web sites.      * Enforce a password policy. Complex passwords make it difficult to crack password files on compromised computers. This helps to prevent or limit damage when a computer is compromised.      * Configure your email server to block or remove email that contains file attachments that are commonly used to spread viruses, such as .vbs, .bat, .exe, .pif and .scr files.      * Isolate infected computers quickly to prevent further compromising your organization. Perform a forensic analysis and restore the computers using trusted media.      * Train employees not to open attachments unless they are expecting them. Also, do not execute software that is downloaded from the Internet unless it has been scanned for viruses. Simply visiting a compromised Web site can cause infection if certain browser vulnerabilities are not patched.    Removal:    To delete the value from the registry  Important: Symantec strongly recommends that you back up the registry before making any changes to it. Incorrect changes to the registry can result in permanent data loss or corrupted files. Modify the specified subkeys only. For instructions refer to the document: How to make a backup of the Windows registry.       1. Click Start > Run.     2. Type regedit     3. Click OK.          Note: If the registry editor fails to open the threat may have modified the registry to prevent access to the registry editor. Security Response has developed a tool to resolve this problem. Download and run this tool, and then continue with the removal.       4. Navigate to the following subkey and revert the registry entry to it's original value:          HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wi... NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"userinit" =        "[ORIGINAL VALUE],%ProgramFiles%\Windows Media Player\svchost.exe"       5. Exit the Registry Editor.

AA10140002	First off, I'd say that you have no content - there is nothing on your website to "want" visitors to stay. Think about:  1. The purpose of your website.  2. Why should someone stay?  3. You have a contact page and a guestbook page - why would someone even want to contact you or write something in your guestbook?  4. You first page has nothing on it - I clicked off as soon as I saw that nothing was even there.|`|1d7094695a8163b4fe6609a21759113caa	it luks good awsome free website i am so gonna use it to uplaod mp3s|`|533b965a4e85d2508d949dc436500dc7aa	dude u must add some links
AA10140002	This would be perfect for what you want to do. It's accomplished with HTML and CSS only, and is really easy to do. You would just need to create your little personal profile box with the info inside of it and save it as a graphic file. Then incorporate it within the code. Go here and check it out: http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/magnify.ht...    Slide your mouse over the image there and you'll see for yourself.

AA10140002	You can't insert a pdf file onto a page, but you can upload the file to your hosts server and provide a link to it so that if someone clicks on it, it'll open up.
AA10140002	If you just want to print your website out while it's online, just right-click your mouse button and click on "print".  When I clicked on "view source" though, I noticed that you used SiteBuilder thru Yahoo to design your own website and none of the text you have written are in any of the source files. I guess that's a definite drawback to using Sitebuilder.     Aside from that, for a very serious author with a very serious business, I'm very surprised that you have a site that's a bit on the amateurish side. I would suggest that since you have your own domain, to check out some of the templates here: http://www.oswd.org/    Some look very professional in layout and design, and you can still use the dandelion as a logo, however, it really should be done in a header along with your company name, etc. with the rest of the info in a footer, to give it a more professional look and appeal to any visitor that comes along.    Note: When your website comes up in my browser, there is no title listed....it just comes up as "Blank"....so if someone were to bookmark your site, "blank" is what would be in the bookmark!     Here's the code that you have:            Blank    Between the  and , put your company name there.    Just a few tidbits for ya,  Hope this helps a bit,  DianeD  Please feel to contact me via my website.  http://www.dironwebdesign.com/|`|mpSGcjpEaa	First, I noticed you used sitebuilder. I am not familiar with sitebuilder at all. BUT, here is what you can do:  Find both these two:     1:  .textTail {font-family:monospace, san-serif; font-size:medium; font-style:bold; color:660066;}     2:          BODY {font-family:"Arial"; font-size:14;}        P {font-family:"Arial"; font-size:14;}        FORM {margin:0;padding:0;}      -->    Combine both of the two style elements and add the attribute  media="all" as follows:    BODY {font-family:"Arial"; font-size:14;}  P {font-family:"Arial"; font-size:14;}  FORM {margin:0;padding:0;}  .textTail {font-family:monospace, san-serif; font-size:medium; font-style:bold; color:660066;}      -->

This person is usually depended on to find many system level bugs during the development of a piece of software.  Programmers are usually split among different modules of a piece of software and are responsible for bugs in those modules.  When the modules are put together one or more QA people then run scripted tests on the software.  The results of the test are then compared with expected results for discrepencies.  While the QA person does not necessarily need to know a specific programming language the knowledge of how programming languages work and how they are used to build the software is a plus when helping to determine what might possibly be causing a bug in the software.
AA10140002	There are many ways to promote the website.     1. You can take place ads in newspapers and computer-related magazines.    2. You could join web design forums, programming forums, etc. and use the website link in your signature. There are always people asking about places to get freelance work. Reply to them, word of mouth travels fast.    3. You can advertise on Craigs List.    4. Start a newsletter with the "latest and greatest job offers" and include some tidbits of information to make it interesting.    5. Write articles about what freelancing is about and how people can become active and then submit them to article directories, taking advantage of the source box utilizing a good signature with links.    6. Write up a good Press Release. There are a few around that accept "free" press releases, too.    That's about all I could think of at the moment.    DianeD

If you're using Microsoft products (Word/Front Page/etc) or even Macromedia products, there should be a button on one of the toolbars that'll look like a chain...    Otherwise, use Notepad (or any other plain text editor) and open up your .htm or html file and put the following in the place you want the link to sit:    Click here to download    This is called an 'ancor' tag (or link).  This will prompt the user with an open/download file box if you point href="" to a file, otherwise if its another webpage, it'll just jump to that page!

In order to apply to a group of 500 rows, you would need to use CONCATENATE function first to join all the cells together into a single string of text.    Alternately, just put the PROPER function int a cell to the right of last cell in first row.  Then copy down and copy right to apply formula to all cells relating to your 500 rows.    In closing, I don't understand what it is you're trying to accomplish by applying PROPER function to 500 rows in a single function.  Maybe you can better explain your unltimate objective and maybe we can work out a solution.    Hope this helps!  Kind Regards,  QwertyKPH @ Yahoo!

AA10164248	On some systems, depending on the brand, the pump can be noisy. Water cooling is only necessary if you are over clocking. Before moving to water cooling why not give a better heat sink and fan a try. Zalman's are very quiet, and run cool. Take a look at these below:  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    And these have even bigger 120mm fans (make sure they fit in your case first)  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  These fans listed here are for AMD systems, however, you can get Intel system fans from Zalman and other high end, high performance heatsink manufacturers.    UPDATED RESPONSE:    We are sticking to the question, you're not listening, however. There's no way if you're using a large copper heatsink, with a large 92mm or 120mm fan (larger fans move more air so they don't have to spin as fast, thus making less noise)  that you are going to have noise. It just isn't going to happen, even if the fan is running at full speed. Unless you're over clocking, the fan just simply doesn't have to work that hard if it's a large fan from a manufacturer like Zalman that specializes in quiet cooling.    Either your noise is coming from a different fan in your system, such as your power supply fan, or your chipset fan, hard drive fan, or case fan,  or you're using smaller, cheaper, higher rpm fans, coupled with non copper heat sinks.|`|lM618mq1aa	Try to avoid water cooling..as it is not only noisy but also risky..try using air-cooling or liquid nitrogen cooling...sorry for my answer if it doesn't help..|`|54a5da66d78ad538dc937c22f62d06b6aa	Although I have not used water cooling systems, I can vouch 100% for the fact that water cooling systems are superior to air cooling systems. Also, since water cooling systems are better, they don't need to work as hard as fans to cool the system, so the system will be quieter.    If your system is overheating, add large fans. A water cooling system will cost over 100 bucks at least, and it's not that worth it. Clean up your wiring, wipe down fans, etc. and make sure that you have good airflow. Adding large fans will keep the system quiet and cool.|`|a45f5e1aa80b644906385fe5813cdc98aa	Not usually any more then a fan, because the fan is keeping the radiator grid cooling the water flowing through it.   A properly installed pump will be noiseless, while it vibrates.    I installed a Big Water 735 into my system.|`|016901c007d49baca9e0baaea0ebf766aa	Depends on your definition of noisy.  It is not any noisier than some of the high speed fans.      But if the overheating is new to the system, I'd try cleaning everything first, and renewing the CPU's heatsink compound (I use Artic Silver).       If it has been an ongoing problem, I'd look into getting a better box for your system.  Some of the cheap boxes just don't have good ventilation and do not cool down the system board well enough. Even putting a water cooled heatsink  on it won't change that.
AA11892245	put this in the tag for each cell:    width="200"    I think that should make them stay 200 px wide.|`|Zv8koYGDaa	Do it the stylesheet way.

After putting in that class, in your table you want to perform the following:        [All your content here]        Viola! That easy. Hope that helps you out.|`|c506b5b64fd0a10fae3fe3bf5ef7d063aa	The use of  is not considered to be clean code anymore with the introduction of css though it has not officially been deprecated.    The answer above dealing with CSS is incorrect as it would make the table 200 pixels wide and not the cells.    The proper way to do this would be to use css, but make the cells themselves 200px wide whcih could be done two ways:    ---1. for use in seperate stylesheet---  table.main td { width:200px; } /*in your stylesheet*/          1  2        ---2. for use inline---      1  2        Also, since you have rather wide cells, your table will resize due to a browser window being narrower - a way around this is to include a transparent gif that is simpy 1 pixel tall at the beginning of each cell - it is a little hacky, but until all browsers honor the css 'min-width' property, it is the only surefire way around this.|`|2T917mpmaa	You need to "fix" the cell width using either the "width" attribute (works and is still good clean code), or use CSS with divs. Remember to always have some content (even if its a non-breaking space character   in the cell). I had a very picky client one and finally resorted to using transparent 1X1 pixel gif. That was not clean code (unfortunately), but will work on all browsers on all platforms and monitors. - http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tutori...

781dda71e14507a6610c84713e824c1aaa	What are the requirements for the diary?  In other words, what do you need to give or show to your teacher?  Do you have to do it on the computer, or can you just write it out on paper?    The very simplest way to make a diary on the computer is to use a Text editor (like Notepad).    Each day's entry would have the date on a separate line (like: Tuesday, Dec. 25, 2007).  The lines after that would be whatever you want to write about for that day.    On the next day, go to the end of the file and put in one or two blank lines then enter the date for that day - followed by more lines containing whatever you want to write for that day.    You can't do any formatting with Notepad, so you might want to use MS Word (if you have it).  Then you could make the dates bold and a different font  --  to make them stand out.    Hope that helps.  Good Luck!  |`|AA10140002	I would recommend that you begin a Blog. You can use it as an online diary, design it anyway you'd like (within their guidelines), and it'll look sharp.

Theres a lot of bad learning resources out there (incorrect, obsolete, etc.) and you want to make sure you learn C++ correctly. If you pick C++ by any chance, get the books Accelerated C++ (by Koenig) and C++ Primer (by Stanley Lippman).    > I've been trying to learn Python, but I haven't had any luck.  When you didnt understand something, did you take the time to Google it?    > Also, should I learn Python before the others?  If you cant learn Python, you probably wont get very far with C++ or C.

AA10140002	Yes, CSS is instrumental in laying out how a website "appears" within each browser, but unfortunately, each browser renders various things, like spacing, differently. Therefore, it's vitally important to test your website within each browser before "going live". It's a designers nightmare, and although each new revised version of the browsers are getting closer to solving many of the issue of compatibility, it's still something to consider when designing a website.    It's vitally important to validate your code, did you perform this validation? You can do so here: http://validator.w3.org/    And to validate your CSS, go here: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/    Here's a few websites that may help with cross-browser CSS:  http://friendlybit.com/tutorial/cross-br...  http://www.positioniseverything.net/    Here's a place to view your website within various browsers for testing, here:  http://www.anybrowser.com/  and here:  http://browsershots.org/    Good luck!|`|KBzlQUkAaa	its two different programs ... and web designers don't use proper code or code that only IE can read and that is why it looks diffrent|`|LyWmRdM3aa	If you want your webpage to be universal, meaning you want it to look good on any web browser, then you need to really dig in to the HTML code and make your website as simple as possible.

Another way to solve the problem is that, to let users of your webpage know what, web browser to use.|`|jVWK4Vyuaa	It is called quirky behaviour.  Each browser does something slightly different but as the majority of people use IE then it is important to get it to display properly with that specific browser.

Otherwise it is a case of trial and error because there are sometimes no logical reasons why they should look different.

m0fU0H7jaa	uTorrent preferences are fairly limited, but make sure that you are forwarding the specific port that you address. If you want maximum transfer speeds, do not have uTorrent automatically map a port for you using NAT-PMP or UPnP, and do not Randomize.    If you have questions about how to forward your port through your wireless router, contact me, but www.portforward.com is an EXCELLENT resource.    Another good option that uTorrent has is the ability to enforce encryption. Make sure that in Preferences > BitTorrent you have "Force" enabled.

HOWEVER there will be major problems when attempting this. for one think windows XP can only support one processor, if your processor has more then one processor core, then the rest will be inactive. Also there many people why try to downgrade to xp, fail to check that there hardware has any xp drivers. If xp drivers existed for the laptop's hard-drive, then they would work. BUT if there are no xp drivers, then that hardware that the driver was for will not work.    This problem is common epically for wireless network driver and some laptop-only hardware, I have seen many people who downgrade to xp lose support for wireless networking. Also seen people lose support for webcam and card readers. In some rare cases possibly the cd drive, sound card, and advance graphic abilities.    Then there is the security, because windows didn't start introducing their security setting to default until vista came out, your computer will be much more vulnerable to virus attacks then vista ever was.|`|APDnC55Paa	Yes, it is possible, but I don't know why you would want to. Vista is really superior to XP, a|`|AA12350553	(1) yes you can remove Vista and install XP. However your PC is licensed for Vista, so you'd need to buy an OEM copy of XP (if you can still get them...) to be legitimate.    (2) How difficult? It's not very difficult, you format the disk in the PC and follow the instructions when you boot the XP CD. At fastest it's probably 2-4 hours work depending on your PC's speed and memory.    (3) Are there any risks? Of course there are. Firstly, can you get XP legally at all? Secondly can you get XP drivers for all of the peripherals in your PC - for instance the video card driver, the sound card driver, the USB bridge driver etc etc. If you can't get a driver then you either lose access to a feature or can only use it at reduced capability. Thirdly, this is a destructive opertation. If you get it wrong you have wiped your new laptop out and have no OS on the laptop.    So, in summary... it's fairly easy provided you check beforehand and get the drivers onto a CD disk or a USB stick drive. But if you're not confident there *is* a risk to the process. It's a lot less risk if you leave the Vista restore partitiion / restore CD available so you can always go back to Vista if it all goes horribly wrong.    Alternatively, can you make vista look like XP? I have never used Vista, but I always make XP look like Win2k as it saves a lot of processing power.

There is nothing that is so critical on myspace that can't wait until you get home.|`|AygEpMMaaa	http://www.HiddenEyes.info/  http://www.LockBug.info/  http://www.SurfHole.info/  http://www.SurfingTube.info/  http://www.SurfWire.info/|`|td6WXhv4aa	Circumventing your School Firewall or Hacking it is illegal you can and will get in serious trouble.    Please review the YA community guidelines asking questions that break the law or help other People do is not allowed. Thanks!|`|ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network. Read more on the dangers of proxy's below.|`|SzzfrJHxaa	You can give this proxy a try to unblock those blocked websites; it works like a charm!    http://rocksurf.info    Be sure to tell your friends about it so they too can enjoy.    Happy surfing!|`|6Xreht4Qaa	There's new proxies every day on :    http://www.pr0xyblog.com    Be sure to tell your friends, and post it to your myspace page or blog, so others can enjoy ;-)    Happy Surfing !|`|0fc906a92f0d1030cf506aea74935a77aa	Hail,    School/work servers often have a large, frequently updated website ban list. At my school, proxy websites found are banned within a week (apparently all schools in the state have the same annoying filter, not like you SHOULD be on myspace/bebo/whatever during school time, but eh). Proxytoolbox seems to be the best list of proxys as it is updated very frequently. At least with an updated list, once the proxy that works gets banned you can simply search for another :)      http://www.proxytoolbox.com/    Cheers|`|5srzeNnxaa	qlek.com  abigfruit.info|`|bqGExMW1aa	try mini usb TOR for opel browser version - google it you can put it on a memory stick and nobody will know|`|bi3vmFPvaa	You can try with these proxy:    http://web.orangest.org  http://www.1the.info  www.keepme.info  www.yourfun.info  www.vtunnel.com      Or you can  join this group to get weekly new proxies in your email:   http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/listp...|`|d7RxeNJbaa	hi you can try this one:  surfblast.info
cKLrhh1daa	There's this utility called All Office Converter. you can download it from anywhere for free. it can even convert office documents into pdf, html and txt.|`|AA10690200	Yes, you can use "Save As" 2003 or prior compatible... see drop down list on the choices.  File, Save As.|`|FBQZ06vraa	You should be able to read and write Word 2003 files in Word 2007 (you may have to install the right converter from the Installation CD), but I'm not sure the Track Changes data will be compatible.  It would be a good idea to do some testing beforehand.    Hope that helps.

If that doesn't work then try downloading the 30 day fully functioning trial of Adobe Premiere Pro which gives you lots of options.

DCXk0bVLaa	Could also depend on which skin you're using.  I'm using one called Winamp Modern. Winamp version 5.03.  There's a button on the right to toggle playlist shuffling.  I can also turn shuffle on/off via the "play" menu.  I chose this skin 'cos it's easy to use, easy to read and access functions and also has a selection of 30 odd skin colors.  Some skins are not very intuitive but the function has to be there somewhere. Keep looking.
