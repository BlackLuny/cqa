20090220033108AAgfJWO	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Why do people pull this beauty is in the eye of the beholder BS?	Why can't people just accept the fact that some people are just not attractive. I've seen a few (honest) ugly people post pics on here and most of the comments were bad, and maybe like 1 or 2 people tried to make them feel better by saying "ohh your gorgeous you have nice hair..." yeah right... if they were gorgeous they would be on the covers of magazines.      Likewise, people who are beautiful posting pictures on here always get "you're soo pretty" etc, and nobody thinks they are really ugly, even if they say it (they are just jealous)      So why can't people just be honest?

So, i get quite bad dandruff, especially in the winter...   but i also dye my hair.. and when i use "Head and shoulders" it always fades my hair dye. So, i told my hair dresser about it, and she said that head and shoulders is a really bad shampoo because it dry-es out your hair and makes hair dye fade. So i asked what shampoo to use and she said to use tea tree something. So i have been using tea tree for about, 4 washes now, but it doesn't seem to work, and to be honest it looks like the dandruff is getting worse..   any help?

My natural eye colour is a very, very dark brown, almost black, so i wanted a more lighter brown so you can actually see the difference between my pupil and iris, and also to appear more feminine.       However, i'm not sure whether i should buy them or not because to buy a decent pair from my local opticians, i heard you have to have a prescription, which i don't have seeing as i only want them for cosmetic reasons. I know that you can get cheap coloured contact lenses that are disposable and don't require a prescription, but i'm quite weary of them seeing as they could damage my eyes. So what should i do? I'm a teen and live in the UK by the way.

20090220005342AA5ojPq	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Tattoo Collectors: Who has the guts?	Just a fun Q to break up the usual material.   Who has the guts to go to their artist with nothing particular in mind and say "Use your imagination and go wild"?   I would love to approach an artist that I am found of and just plop down and get a spectacular tattoo with no prior plan beforehand. I know it would be spectacular because I already love his work, and it's a pretty good bet that his enthusiasm to tattoo a piece that he will love doing will translate into a piece I will cherish.   In an ideal world this would be a possibility for me, but unfortunately I already have an unfinished project (or two) that should take priority.    Not to mention the artist I have in mind is going to be very expensive (although worth every single penny,) and there would be some hefty travel expenses included for me in the venture.   All excuses aside...assuming money is no object and you have the space on your skin, would you have the guts?

20090220015558AAiz3oz	Beauty & Style;Hair	Question/Treatment of Traction Alopecia (Hair loss)?	My hair on the top of my head, in front, and especially around the scalp have been thinning dramatically in the past few years. I've been growing my hair as long as I could in the past few years, trying to attain nice long hair, and it's all past my shoulders at this point. EXCEPT for the top of my head which doesn't seem like it has budged in length, and only gotten shorter. This constitutes to a very awkward and terrible looking balance of hair that kills my hopes of having long hair, or at the very least HAIR.      I've been noticing that the hair thinning starts right around where I would normally wear a headset. I should mention at this point I am an avid gamer and computer user, spending many hours a day playing games/working on the computer. I'm always wearing a headset as well, which as I mentioned the hair thinning starts right around there (or ends, you could say).  Behind the headset however, the hair is very long and thick.       I panicked the other day when I began seeing my scalp in the mirror, and decided to do some research on connections between excessive headset usage and hair loss, and found an article that states that frequent use of headsets will cause Traction Alopecia.       I've only been using a headset for a few years, which before I really began wearing a headset all of the time my hair seemed fine. It's been a downward spiral since and I'm slowly piecing it that it's most likely the excessive usage of headsets that could be causing it, after shrugging it off as an unfortunate circumstance of genes.       So, the actual question to be asked is, is it too late for my hair to recover? (I will obviously stop using headsets, or at least a lot less than I do now). Are there any treatments that can be done that don't involve expensive surgeries or drugs with nasty side effects?

20090220062055AAXAnJF	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Approx. weight per dress size?	I was wondering what the approximate weight of a woman is for each dress size. An average of course, the usual 8-16 sizes I suppose.   I'm quite dense in terms of weight, and all the people I know who are the same dress size as me are 2 stone lighter (we're the same height)! I was wondering what the "weight" is per dress size, and therefore how many lbs between each.   I'd prefer a chart or list if anyone has one or can find one, otherwise I'll settle for your own estimations (all you yo-yoers out there!), or even your own weight and current dress size (and height too) - be honest!

She looks really pretty with it. i just want to know that if i dye it blonde will it ruin my hair? how can i prevent this? will it suite me?

Also, I want layers but I don't want short layers cos they add too much volume for me, do you think choppy layers would suit me or should I just go with long layers???   Thanks!   xxx

20090220070510AA1Ac3V	Beauty & Style;Hair	My hair is a bit dull, and feels so damaged. Many split ends. What's wrong with my hair?	I am white/Italian by culture. As a kid, I had gorgeous soft flowing hair. Now in my 20's, I feel like me hair never looks good no matter how much conditioner or heat protector I use. I straighten my hair with a ceramic once a week, and wash it about 3-4 times a week. I use Pantene hair conditioning mask once a week.       I look at other girls my age, and their hair is SO shiny and soft and stays in place. When my hair is straightened, it always gets mussed up and frizzy when it blows in the wind. Then I have to go to the bathroom and use a comb to even think about getting it back to looking decent. The texture is rough and I see so many split ends. What am I doing wrong? What can I do to get shiny soft flowing hair that will flow in the wind?
20090220070452AAPrnyd	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair Dilemma.. Blonde hair gone wrong.?	I dyed my hair using schwarzkopf absolute platinum, about 6 weeks ago and shocking results followed. My hair was a dark blonde with light highlights anyway that had faded, and after using the dye as directed, it turned BANANA yellow. It was like this for about a week and then i bought "Lee Stafford shampoo 4 bleach blonde hair" which was a purple shampoo. This turned my hair a nice ash blonde. However, now my roots are the problem. The dark blonde is coming through and its come through about a centimetre and a half. My hairdresser is coming in about 5 weeks but by then it will look daft. She said she can highlight it brown and split it up with blonde or something like that, but i was just wondering what i can do in the meantime to make my roots look less daft?      I do not want to keep my hair this colour, i want to grow it out but without it looking ridiculous and stripey.      At first, i wanted white hair (gwen/ lady gaga) but realised i'd have to bleach it again which i avoided because it meant more hair breakage.      thanks x

I' getting my lip pierced next week and everyone says it just feels like a pinch....   But how much does it hurt after the lip is pierced, how bad is it (on a scale of 1 to 10- 10 being the most painful) and how long does the pain usually last???   Everyone has a different level of tolerance for pain (i'm a big pussykat)   but i believe i can average it out.
