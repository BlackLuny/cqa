20090225101258AAv6nIg	Politics & Government;Politics	Isn't this bill a necessary step for any?	non-homogenous developed country:       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       I mean, all through history there has never been a society that has had to find ways to coalesce with various groups within a territory [the way some countries within the 21st century have had to], usually what would happen is , one group comes along, fights their way to the top [pissing all the other groups off in the process] and then the second lower groups find an opening they attack, and then the cycle repeats; so isn't this bill, simply trying to compensate for natural flaws in human nature, and mitigate domestic strife in this age of globalization?
20090225101309AAy98lQ	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you think the free market is the economic version of anarchy?	I really do think so.       However, to assume that premise also assumes that we know how real anarchies operate. There is no such thing as a real anarchy. People will always group up and form a society, make laws, start a police force or military, so on and so forth. Even in the biggest anarchies lie a modicum of order and control.      Anyone who thinks the free market is a great idea is really an economic anarchist. They are slightly delusional too, if they think a free market will operate uncorrupted by those in power.
20090225101346AAyNZFj	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	I have a question for democrats and liberals please...?	I am just curious how many of you will voice opposition if and when a nationalized healthcare plan is introduced? Considering that we Americans don't like waiting on anything, How will you feel if it takes 4 and a half months to get to see a specialist and another 4 and a half months to get an MRI? (because this is what is happening in Canada people) you could die of an aneurism or a heart attack waiting to see a doctor. Do you know how many Canadians come to America and pay cash for procedures and doctors visits because their own government won't help them? I am just wondering at what point you will stick up for your rights rather than for losing them and I am curious how dems and libs feel about these very serious issues.     (Obviously I am conservative and Republican but I am just wondering are there any dems or libs out there that realize this will NOT be a good thing for the U.S? Are you going to stand up for how you feel on this issue?) and if so, How? This is an honest question and I want honest answers, no need for ugliness I just am wondering how you all feel about this particular issue? Thanks in advance

20090225101438AAXaDEa	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do Democrats & Independents support good speakers over good thinkers/executives?	Obama is just the latest example.  A completely unproven, inexperienced person.  He happens to give a darn good speech (to most people), but what he talks about is really warmed over socialism which most of the public purports to be against.  Yet he wins.      Republicans have executives with records of success (Palin, Jindal are just the 2 most recently in the news)... yet the public ignores and derides these success stories in favor of people who give good speeches.      I for one look for experience and success...  The captain of the debate team can go work in a lawyer's office and rape businesses that way if they want.  Why should I elect them President to rape the ENTIRE economy?

If the police go out to check on someone that you think may be in need of medical care for fear of possible drug overdose, & when they arrive, the person that answers the door lies to them, & hides them, can that person be charged with obstruction of justice?

It's Illinois, the guy already stated he gave this and supported the guy and so what if he talked to the guy's brother.  He wanted the job and was probably figuring he was glad handing the guy.  I don't think the man is that stupid to do something illegal on purpose, especially knowing before hand that Gov. Blagovitch (msp) was taped and already under investigation.  This in itself would exonerate the man.      But on the other hand if he didn't understand the law well he may not need to be in that position in the first place.  Your feelings on this.       Also would an electin change the situation.  Granted the people of Illinois need good representation and that may be what is needed.

20090227124957AArbHW8	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are both parties so totalatarian?	I am a libertarian who believes you should be able to do what you please as long as you don't hurt anyone else. I thought that was what we all believed?      But looking deeper and deeper into politics over the years I have realized both parties want to control your lifestyle. Republicans are against legalizing drugs or even ending the drug war even though it is a complete waste of time. I can walk 2 steps from my house and buy anything I desire.       Democrats are against free speech when it offends someone and they are pro gun control.       Republicans want to seal our boarders up, well im sorry I don't want to live in east Berlin.       Democrats want people to stop smoking and eating bad foods because its bad for you, and they know best.       Both parties are pretty much against gay marriage and legalizing prostitution as well. In my opinion, if it doesn't affect you personally, you shouldn't care at all about it!

Obama stated during his campaign that all troops would be removed within 16 months, and now faced with the realities of Office he will push the date closer to the one promised by Bush.      This will mean 50,000 troops still remain in Iraq until 2010 (and this may get extended) and that an additional 1,700 troops will be deployed to Afghanistan. This will mean more body bags, and more of your Tax money will be sent to war .      Will we say he has betrayed us and went back on his word or will you proclaim MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?

I fail to see any correlation between border wars and the righs for citizens to bear arms.  Is the 2nd Amendment being challenged by Holder and the Marines will not stand for it?

Here's the problem:      There is a huge family fued amongst my family, my mother, who i live with upstairs, co-owns a house with my grandmother on my father's side, who lives downstairs. As a result of the fighting, my grandmother has unplugged the family's router, which resides in the basement near the fuse box. We are unsure if we are allowed to go downstairs and plug it back in, she seems to be pretty angry at the moment and we are unsure if she can file something like trespassing against us if we go downstairs and plug the router back in. Is there a method in which we can resolve this, or force her to plug the router back in, there's only one computer that has wireless in the house and the rest are near-useless in their present state.      Is there some sort of law or such that would force her to leave it on, like some sort of "Denial of Service by a third party" or something, Your ideas and comments are very much appreciated, and sorry if I sound inexpierienced, I'm not too familiar with laws. A reply however is needed ASAP.

20090227161802AA75EuN	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did the American political elite promote capitalism despite of its obvious flaws and bad results?	More than 12 million American children grow up in impoverished homes. When compared with 20 other wealthy nations on measures of health, safety and relative poverty, America's children fare amongst the worst.   In terms of the human development index, the United States has fallen from second place in 1990 (behind Canada) to 12th place. This decline continued through both the Clinton and Bush administrations, with the US falling to sixth in 1995, ninth in 2000, and 12th in 2005.   In certain respects, the decline is even worse. The US is 34th in infant mortality—with a level comparable to Croatia, Estonia, Poland and Cuba. US school children perform significantly below their counterparts in countries like Canada, France, Germany and Japan, and 14 percent of the population, some 40 million people, lack basic literacy and number skills.   Of the world’s 30 richest nations, which comprise the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States has the highest proportion of children living in poverty, 15 percent, and the most people in prison, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the whole population. With five percent of the world’s population, the US has 24 percent of the world’s prisoners.   The report notes: “Social mobility is now less fluid in the United States than in other affluent nations. Indeed, a poor child born in Germany, France, Canada or one of the Nordic countries has a better chance to join the middle class in adulthood than an American child born into similar circumstances.”   In overall life expectancy, the United States ranks an astonishing 42nd, behind not only Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and all the countries of Western Europe, but also Israel, Greece, Singapore, Costa Rica and South Korea.    http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?c...     http://www.spotlightonpoverty.org/why_sp...

20090227160619AAdp12O	Politics & Government;Politics	I actually just got scared. Is this the right thought process to have?	Someone proposed that if the people that own their own businesses and are making over $200,000 a year would go out of business, things would be much cheaper.   The same person said, that he/she worked for a person who owned their own business and made over $300,000 a year. They said, that someone could do the same job for $50,000 and the rest could be used for other things.   My question is this: Is this the right way to be thinking?   I believe this way of thinking is what is going to cause our country to go Socialist.   Instead of wanting to achieve and become successful like that guy did.   they would rather he lose his business so others could do it for $50,000.   seems like the logical way to think now is, I want the guy to lose what he has so he can become like me..   what do you think?

20090227161100AA4DFoK	Politics & Government;Politics	When Rangel and Obama re-instated the draft, will you be dodging it proudly like me? I recommend you do?	here are the following reasons why  I would be dodging the draft, I recommend you all do the same.      1.I am not a murderer, baby killer or paid hit-man for anybody even the government   2.   I don't have to answer to obama or anybody else but myself, who is a few jerks in washington to tell me what to do?   3. America represents the evil sides of these wars. Iraq and afghanistan are wrong, Neither one of these nations attacked us or did anything to us. Obama wants to invaded pakistan, and Other Nations see USA as a threat to world peace, b/c usa is invading countless nations for oil, profits, power and military based for illegal wars and russia,china may attack u.s.a. to try to stop ww3, or start ww3.      USA is the threat to world peace.      4. I am not a sucker. I know wars are staged for profits. The biggest business in the world is war.   In 1972, Henry Kissinger referred the troops are "military men are just dumb stupid animals to be used for profits in foreign policy"   5. The globalists are the real enemy.      6. There is no need for any troops, they have enough technology to use. they use make people think otherwise for the money.      7. We lost 125,000 men eligible to serve. 5000 dead and 120,000 wounded who can not go back, Even if america was threatened why should i pay for the republicans mistakes on 2 illegal wars.   We would still have over 125,000 eligible men and women   8. I will not be used for a government.NOW that murdered its own people in order for them to achieve there global conquest and help them steal oil and gain power.            I plan on dodging the draft, when its re-instated before 2012, i believe by simply living in the wilderness or by the beach or in a cabin, where there is no population and nobody knows i am there. I will be having the time of my life while you go and have your freinds brains blown out of there heads and landing right in your face
20090227155712AAkS9L2	Politics & Government;Government	Do you agree with me that all marijuana users are evil?	I believe so. Anyone who doesn't think they're evil is probably a pot smoker themself. Pot smokers are pure evil because they don't have any respect for the law or their own health. They don't care that they're giving themselves lung cancer and brain damage, they just care about the dumb high it gives them. Sure, you can't OD on pot, but you can't on cigarettes either and both of those kill you in the same way-- over a long period of time. They are destroying the very fabric of American culture and society. I can't turn on the TV or read a newspaper without seeing or hearing some dumb-**** stoner saying that weed should be legal. America has enough problems trying to do away with stoners whilst pot is illegal; if it was legalized, the cops can't touch them and they will spread their disgusting, pointless, and deadly vice to others, turning them into unproductive and unmotivated slackers who spend the rest of their lives sitting around eating their weight in junk food and watching crap TV. Meanwhile, tumors will form in their lungs and brain cells will die, but they won't notice or care because they'll think it's worth it for their stupid high.       I can safely say that I speak for all non-stoners when I say that pot and pot smokers should be done away with and punished as severely as possible. Any non-stoner that disagrees with me is probably just waiting for it to be legal to take up the habit.

And if he goes ahead with his promises, no doubt the illegals will in turn invite their extended family [brothers, cousins, etc.] and friends to come here too, so that we wind up with over 100 million of them.      Do you think Obama should do that? Or do you think he instead should GET RID OF THEM?

20090227160233AAoIeLX	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you support bringing back the 55 MPH speed limit?	I don't accept the excuse that people who are in a "hurry" need to get to where they need to go. If you're like the average American and have a 12-mile commute to work, the difference between going 65 MPH versus 55 MPH is about 2 minutes. In other words, you'll get to your destination a whopping 2 minutes faster going at 65 mph than you would at 55 mph. But the difference in rates of accidents, fatalities, is substantially reduced with that 10 mph reduction in speed.       If the average American is really in that much of a hurry, shouldn't they be carrying around a milk carton (to relieve themselves in their car) in order to save time from going to a restroom?       I don't accept the idea that America is a "free country" where people can do anything they damn well please. If something creates a hazard to others, it should be (and usually is) against the law. And don't get me wrong, we should also vigorously enforce laws against people using cell phones, tailgating or weaving regardless of their speed.       As for trucks, or people driving long distances, they'll just have to set out on the road a little earlier to get from Point A to Point B. But they'll still get there. And they'll have the benefit of great gas mileage, so they don't have to whine and moan (as many Americans like to do) about the cost of gas.       I don't care what Sammy Hagar says. Like it or not, Americans *can* drive 55...

20090227153829AAbqHRL	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What is the statue of limitations on filing a criminal and civil case of domestic violence in California?	The last incident occurred 12/1/98.  I was a very immature 20 and did not have a supportive family environment.  I moved out with my then boyfriend and he became violent toward me.  The last time I saw him was 12/1/98.  That night he hit me and left me pretty bruised up.  I escaped and called the cops.  The cops unfortunately where not at all sympathetic to my situation and just gave me a report receipt and told me to file charges on my own.  The next morning I went to the court house to file for a restraining order which I received.  When the cops tried to serve my ex his copy of the restraining order he was gone.  I found out from our roommates that he left that night and never returned.  Later I found out he left the state.  Not knowing where he went or how to get a hold of him for paperwork I did not pursue filing domestic violence charges.  It has taken me all this time to finally be able to talk about what happened to me.  I have gone to counseling and started the process of healing.  Recently, I found out that my ex is currently serving time in a Kansas prison for rape and battery.  I have a lot of unresolved feelings about what happened but more so I am angry at myself for not having the strength to follow through on charging him for what he did to me.  Some how I think I could have saved his later victims from having to go through what I did.  I would very much like to move forward now to seek justice and closure.  What is the statue of limitations on filing a criminal and civil case of domestic violence?

20090227154617AA5TEBp	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What happens if a person you met a restaurant walks out on a bill without paying for it?	So my story is.... Early this morning (3 a.m.ish) I met a friend from high school at a restaurant. He brought another friend with him. When we were greeted by the waitress and my high school friend asked for our bills together and his friends separate. I agreed to pay our bill because I told my friend I would cover our next meal (which was the one we were having). When it was time to go I pulled out my card to pay and placed it on the table with the check. I went to the bathroom and when I returned they had left. I need better friends I know.      The waitress had not taken my card from the table for my check so I handed it to her and said that I would look outside. I called my friend from high school and of course no answer. She asked what is she suppose to do about the other guy's check and I said I do not know. I am not paying for his food. She handed me my receipt and I was leaving. The police were there and said I had not paid my bill. I had a receipt in my hand.      The police said that I was responsible for paying the bill for the person that walked out because we planned it. First of all it makes no sense that I would leave my credit on the table in plain sight to pay and my wallet in the seat if I were planning not to pay.      I refused and the "tough" police said I need to contact my friends and if I could not I would be arrested. I said for what and I would absolutely sue the police department because I did not do anything wrong. "tough" police says that well if I made bail in the morning then I could sue.      I called 911 immediately. I told the operator that I was being held by police at a restaurant and my bill was paid in full. The operator asked if I needed back up police and I said yes.   I guess the call went across the walkie and more police were on the way when the "tough" guys partner decides to speak.       The partner takes me inside to speak with the waitress. He ask her did I pay. She says yes but her friend did not. The partner ask what is she going to do. She said write it off as a walk out. The partner turns to me and tells me to leave and get better friends.      I agreed and left.      My only concern is could they have actually arrested my for refusing to pay someone else's bill? If so, what would they charge me with?

20090227155019AAqYDPI	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Real Estate Law:  Verbal agreement California / Lease Termination?	Hi,      We had an 18 month residential lease with a landlord that expires on March 10, 2009.  As per the contract, the landlord gave written notice on the 9th of February stating that she was not go allow the extension of the contract into a month-to-month agreement.  This was totally in her legal right.     In a  conversation while delivering this written notice, the landlord and I agreed to extend the "move out" date until April 1st.  I actually tried to get April 11th and she said "let's just keep it at April 1st".        Today we received a letter from her Attorney stating that the landlord expects us to vacate the premises by the 9th of March. The letter also states that the Landlord intends to forthwith action to remove us from the premises if we fail to honor the lease.     The letter also states that if action becomes necassry, we  will be held liable for a variety of damages.      A few questions:   1) Do we have any ability to enforce the verbal agreement. We are only looking for 19 days.      2) How severe are the potential damages and what is the time frame and pathway to execute removing us from the premises.        Thanks in advance.      Jonathon

I mean if certain people are urban self employed ranchers and agriculturalists etc. they should be actually funded and supported by the government to help them stay in business, whether this is by tax breaks or whatever.      And people who live in cities have different needs obviously that have to be addressed as well.      All Americans should be called upon (FEDERALLY) to assist with certain things while states make their own rules about taxes etc. which are needed for their particular states.      I would think this is how America runs I dont know.  States are pretty big too and I would think there should be two maybe even three levels of government.  The largest looking after federal affairs like military, healthcare, governing policies etc, states looking after roads, water, hydro, etc.      The needs of all Americans should be addressed and perhaps there would not be such a huge divide.      I never get a straight answer as to the WHY this divide exists in the first place but it's there, and you can't survive unless there is common ground.

So what listed power lets them regulate home grown marijuana for personal use?      If your answer is "the power to regulate interstate commerce," then you missed the part about it being "home grown" for "personal use."

20090227165134AAsolRd	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Any laws about used cars? need serious info !! =]?	okay so heres the story. my boyfriend, who is 18 just bought a car off of someone a few days ago. the 24th of feburary. around 12:00 noon of that day he had the title transfered from the previous owners name to my boyfriends mothers name,and also got insurance for this car. the next day we were driving around and smoke started coming out from under the hood.we were lucky enough to have a friend with us that went to machanic school for 4 years and knows alot about cars,we were able to get it under control then for about another half hour till it started again,and the next day it continued to smoke off and on. my boyfriend then went to the guys house who sold it to him with all of the problems and the guy said there was nothing he could do about it,called my boyfriend an idiot numerous times,and had an excuse for everything wrong with the car. He also told my boyfriend and his mother the day they were at the notarty that there was nothing wrong with the car at all,untill he was at his house and then he decided to tell him that the 4 wheel drive dosnt work,theres a "trick" with the ac and heating,and some other things.and now today,the car will not start. it starts up for about 10 seconds then shuts right back off. my boyfriends family is thinking of something to do to hopefully get my boyfriends money back and return the car. my boyfriend gave him 600 upfront for the vehical and still owes him 400. but the previous owner said he still expects his money monthly.He does not know the car is not working now. So my point of this question is...is there any law that we could maybe pull on this guy to show him it is not fair of him to do this. he lied from the first day and said the car is fine,which it clearly is not,my boyfriend had it looked at by an ex machanic who said it would cost him about 5,000 dollars to fix everything wrong with it. i heard there is a law about something that if you sell a used car to someone it has to work for a certain amount of days,is that true? or does anyone have any other information we could use? i greatly appreciate anything. thanks in advance. =]

We signed an agreement with a small local security company in 2002 for monitoring the security system they installed.  A few years ago, the company was bought out by a very large security company.  We just moved to another state so we tried to cancel our security monitoring but the new company told us that we are on a two year automatic renewal and they must be notified in writing 30 days before the contract renews, which of course was just back in Oct. 2008.  We asked them to send us the contract and they sent us the original one we signed in 2002 with the first company, that did in fact state that it was on an automatic two year renewal.  There is nothing about if they sell to a another company obligating us.  Also, we never signed anything with the second company.  Are we still obligated to pay for a monitoring service we cant use for another 20 months when we never signed anything with them?      Thanks for any help.

20090225102914AArq1iu	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why can the so many parties obtain impunity, when they claim “Domestic Terrorism”?	I filed a small claims action in a local court.  It cost me about $25 to file, $50 to serve the defendant, and a lot of driving around.  The amount I was asking was $24,000.  It was a simple case, that I would be easily awarded a settlement for.      The court was supposed to send the defendant and myself postcards informing us of the court date.  The court did so over a holiday weekend.  The postcards were mailed Friday afternoon, but Monday was a holiday.  The court date was on Tuesday.  Both myself, and the defendant received our postcards after the court date.  The case was dismissed for a “no-show”.      I complained, but the judge refused to budge on this.  I tried going over his head, but nobody would co-operate.  I was out $24,075.  I assumed I could go to a different court, so I asked that they make good on the $75.  They refused.  I kept complaining until the head of “Court Security” contacted me. He placed a restraining order against me to keep me from contacting the court.  He stated that if I attempted to do so again, I would be regarded as a “terrorist” and can be jailed indefinitely in Guantanamo Bay.      Now this really pisses me off.  There is no excuse for this, and from what everyone tells me there no appeal.  I was tempted to get a lawyer, and ask him to get me the entire $24,075, and my legal costs.  As soon as the word potential “Domestic Terrorist” was mentioned, no lawyer would touch it.        Maybe I missed something, but last I know Bin Laden was not after a refund from a half-baked municipal count when he ordered the attack on the World Trade Center.  Clearly these morons would not know what a terrorist is if they where hit in the head by one.      I ran into a similar case with our phone carrier when they let an ‘identity thief’ get phone service in my name, in a nearby town.  They would not turn off the account, and I became very angry.  They said any "threat" (what threat?) against a public telephone carrier is considered “Domestic Terrorism”.      So does this mean any clown who wants rip anyone off can yell, “Domestic Terrorism” and do as he or she pleases?

20090225103751AAUhdSt	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Question about auto accident and whether or no to contact an attorney...?	So I was in an auto accident back in November.  I drove a focus, the other car was a mid 90's suburban, and it side wiped me, and knocked my car over a lane.  Luckily, no one was in the other lane, but it messed up my neck and lower back pretty bad.        I've been seeing a chiropractor since about a week after the accident, and he told me that it would be approx 6 months of treatment.  It's been about halfway through the time frame, and while I am better, my neck still hurts.  I work an office job, so it's got nothing to do with work.        I just found out today that the other person's insurance is claiming that I have gone beyond a "reasonable" time for treatment, and that I am not supposed to go anymore, even though I'm still in pain.  (I should note that I work for the insurance company that I am insured by, and so was the other party).  My boss (an agent w/some claims background) has suggested that I may want to see an actual physician (as opposed to just the chiropractor) and get an "official" opinion.  I'm thinking I may need to start looking at an attorney as well.        In order to avoid any additional expenses, I did stop going for now, as I can't afford to risk any out of pocket expenses beyond what I've been treated for.  But, I still hurt.        My question is should I wait and see if they cover all the expenses so far before getting an attorney or should I start looking into that option now?  I don't think its fair that I'm still in pain and am being told that my treatment is "unreasonable".

Ok so i was backing out of a parking space of a grocery store and another lady behind me was doing the same.. we hit each other but it was no big deal, i got out checked out my car and there was no damage, when i looked up the other lady was no where in sight.. since i didn't get her plates down and there was no damage to my car, i left... fast forward three hours later a cop came to my house and told me that the lady did get my plates down, but that there was no damage to her car either so she was not going to file a claim, the cop basically just told me that when that sort of thing happens not to leave (duh) but i thought the lady had left so that's why i left... he didn't give me a ticket or anything like that, nut he did take down my info...   so my question is... am i going to get a ticket in the mail?    Or is my insurance gunna go up?   Or am i gunna get sent to court or something like that?   PLEASE HELP!!!

20071215095407AA2GJ3G	Politics & Government;Politics	Ten menos y disfruta más. Que les parece?	Ante las pugnas del capitalismo y el socialismo-comunismo, ricos y pobres. Que si el que trabaja más no por eso tiene derecho a tener más sino beneficiar al que no tiene. Que si el todo debe ser de todos o cada quien debe ganarse lo que merece, etc, etc, etc.    Yo que no abogo en forma radical ni por una posición ni otra, sino que tengo muy claro como debe ser mi sistema de vida en función a mis necesidades y mis valores tanto como individuo como comunidad; pienso que la la mejor decisión que podemos tomar es:   Tener menos y disfrutar más. No te preocupes por comprar casa, ya habrá quien te de alojamiento, o encontrarás que propiedad invadir. No te preocupes por trabajar, pidiendo limosna o viviendo a expensas de otro podrás suplir tus necesidades básicas. Preocupate a qué partido político engancharte que te de una bola de billetes, preocúpate a quien le tiene que jalar para conseguir beneficios.   Esa es la verdad de los ultraderechas y ultraizquierda. Busca en la historia y entenderás
