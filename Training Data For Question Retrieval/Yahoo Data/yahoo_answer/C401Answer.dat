Gzk1TQFAaa	I live in Florida where it's very humid and very moldy.  I buy a product called Mold Away at a home center near me.  It costs about $15 a gallon and is very effective in removing mold from exterior walls.  You might want to try something like that on your damaged clothes.  A de-humidifier is a little expensive but would help a lot providing doors and windows are closed.  Another thing that might help is to turn on a space heater long enough to help dry out the air.  (around here it's usually too hot for that.  Good luck, hope this helps.|`|hTieELhTaa	Well i know that when your clothes sit in the washer for to long and get moldy if you wash them agin and add about a capfull of viniger and soap it gets rid of the mold. Im not sure how to prevent it though sorry
AdoTLU0xaa	Perspex is great stuff to work with and easy to use, but only if you have the correct equipemnt to hand.  The more equipment you have, the easier it is and the more things you can do with it.  For example, using a special machine, perspex can be easily bent with perfect results.  <br>  <br>  And to answer your question.....Yes you could make a low line TV unit with perspex.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with your project!!.|`|YuWLcExJaa	Polycarbonate is toughter though and less likely to scratch than acrylic/perspex.

The best way to save big time on electric bill is actually shutting down on water heater when not in use. Just turn it on about 10 min. before you need a hot water would save you up to 40% of your electric bill.
a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	I bought three of them a few years back.  You can have them, they were a waste of money.<br>  <br>  I bought 4 tomato plants, all the same variety.  Planted two in the topsy turvy planters, the other two went into the ground.  Those in the topsy turvy planters produced 3 small, sickly tomatoes.  Those in the ground produced several pounds of large tomatoes.<br>  <br>  The topsy turvy planters are nearly impossible to water.  You're supposed to pour the water through a small opening in the top of the "bag", but the water tends to run between the bag and the soil inside and drain right out the bottom.   The only other option was to take down the whole shebang several times a week and soak it in a large tub of water.  And you know what?  Those topsy turvy planters are pretty darn heavy when they're full of soil and plants and water.  Plus it is impossible to tell whether or not the plant actually needs to be watered since you can't see or feel the soil inside the planter.<br>  <br>  I've seen them in other people's yards too, but I have yet to see one that has a large, healthy plant growing in it.  They are just a gimmick.  <br>  <br>  I'm having a garage sale this spring and if some schmuck wants to buy those from me, they're welcome to them.

Be sure to get the plastic lid, too. Cut or drill a hole in the bottom of the bucket (about 3-4 inches in diameter or so). Turn the bucket over and put a paper towel or coffee filter over the hole and fill the bucket with soil. Put a paper towel or coffee filter on top of the soil and put the plastic lid on the bucket. Cut a hole in the lid about like the one you cut in the bottom. You can also use an old t-shirt or large rag to cover the bucket instead of the plastic lid, if you wish. Flip the bucket over so that it is upside down. Plant your tomato plant in the hole in the bottom of the bucket and leave it alone for a few days until the plant is established. Then pick up the bucket, turn it over so that the bucket is upside down and hang it up (you may need help doing this). Water the plant through the hole in the top. I put a 2 X 4 through my deck railing and placed cinder blocks on the part of the 2 X 4 on the deck as a counterbalance and hung the bucket on the other end.

4IC78le4aa	Good old fashioned white vinegar is the best cleaner there is. It gets rid of all musty smells, can be used as a cleaner in the bathroom, as a softener and kills bacteria, elimates static and more. It removes mildew and prevents it from coming back. Puts shine back into your basins, baths, shower and sinks. Works as a glass cleaner and disinfectant and removes mineral deposits from shower heads as well as shines ceramic tiles and whitens grout. Poor undiluted vinegar on a soft cloth and wipe over chrome and anything else needing cleaning and it will be gleaming.<br>  <br>  To remove mildew and mould, pour 3 tablespoons of white vinegar, 1 teaspoon of borax powder and 2 cups of hot water into a spray bottle and shake. spray on painted surfaces, tiles, windows, wherever you see mould and mildew. Use a soft scrubbing brush to work the solution into stains or just leave to soak in.<br>  <br>  For ceramic tiles soap scum or water spots (white marks) scrub with 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup ammonia and 1/4 cup of borax powder mixed in 4 litres of water water. Rinse well with cool water and allow to air dry.<br>  <br>  Use neat with a toothbrush on grout and full strength on porcelain with scrubbing sponge or brush and rinse with cold water. To remove hard water stains, pout in 3 cups of white vinegar under running hot tap water, Let the bath fill up over the stains and allow to soak for 4 hours. When the water drains out, you can easily scrub off the ring or water mark.<br>  <br>  Add a cup to your washload for germs with nappies, tea towels, bath towels sheets etc and they will come out soft - no need for softener and smelling fresh. Added to your last rinse, a cup of vinegar will leave your clothes static and lint free and will also set newly  dyed fabrics in colour. Add 2 cups to your blanket wash final rinse to remove soap build up and leave them fresh and soft. It will also whiten dingy white socks - add 1 cup vinegar to 2 litres of tap water in  a large pot or saucepan and bring to boil and pour into a bucket and add dingy socks and leave to soak overnight. Wash them next day as normal.<br>  <br>  Undiluted vinegar is the best grease cutter in existence and poured on a sponge to clean up stove stop etc. then wipe over with cold water and a sponge.<br>  <br>  Pour 3-4 tablespoons of white vinegar in your dishwashing detergent and it will triple the strength of your dishwashing liquid and cut grease .

AA12139345	If you want a strong joint, it would be best to create an interlocking edge/profile on the pieces you wish to join.  Then use a good wood glue, like Titebond II.  I'd use a screw before I'd use a nail.<br>  <br>  This type of router bit, for example, would provide for a good strong miter joint - <a href="http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?Offerings_ID=2142&TabSelect=Details" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?Offer...</a><br>  And here is one called a 'drawer lock' - <a href="http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?Offerings_ID=5709&TabSelect=Details" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?Offer...</a><br>  <br>  A more simple approach would be to cut a rabbet, dado, or notch, so that you have more joint surface, on which to put glue.  Many bookshelves and cabinets use this method when applying the back to the unit.<br>  <br>  If you want to go 'old school', then dovetail the edges together - hold tight enough tolerances, and you won't even need any glue.  There are a number of 'simpler' methods of notching edges so that the pieces overlap each other, called 'box joints', or 'finger joints'.  They all work on the same principle, but are made of simpler geometric shapes.  All of these methods provide for a very strong joint.<br>  Now... since you are using 1/2" plywood, you'll find you cannot make a lot of 'small' dovetails, or box joints - the plywood will break off.  So, instead of making a 1/2" dovetail, for example, make a 1", or 2", etc, dovetail, or box joint.  Just a note on the side here, dovetailing requires a router, or a really good hand with a saw and chisel, hehehehe.. but a box joint can be made on a table saw, as well as the dado, and rabbet joints.<br>  <br>  The worst thing you could do, would be to just nail one flat edge up against another.<br>  <br>  Now, all you said was the box is going to be 1ft 3 (inches).... do you mean its a cube?  or are the length, width and height different?  For a strong platform to stand on, you want to make not only the outsides of the box, but you should also put one or two pieces inside, vertically, to help support more weight, and make the whole thing 'stiffer'.<br>  <br>  I've built steps out of basic boxes, as well as platforms, stair landings, and even choir risers.  You can make this very stable and strong.<br>  <br>  Again, use glue if it is allowed in this project, and use screws, not nails, if you must use a fastener.  IF you use one of the above mentioned methods of notching the edges together (finger joints, dovetails, etc), then you won't need any nails, screws, or even glue, if you keep your tolerances tight.<br>  <br>  Feel free to email me, if you have any questions, or would like to go into more detail about your project.<br>  <br>  Have Fun|`|e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Without describing any limitations, here's what I would do to achieve your goal:  About 2 inches from the edge of the side piece, I'd cut a 1/2 inch slot from the top of the plywood, and extend the slot halfway down the side.  For example, if the height of your box is going to be 12", measure and cut the 1/2" slot (same width as the plywood for a reason) 6" down to the middle of the board.  Next, cut a 1/2" slot in the perpendicular board that will join to that side. It should be 2" from the edge as well; however, this slot should start from the bottom, and extend upwards 6".  Then you can join these two boards together, by sliding one board on top of the other where the slots are cut.  Do this all around the for joints and the square will remain firm without using any glue or nails or screws.  You could also add a middle brace by using the same method, just cut slots in the middle of the side boards and the middle brace. This will allow you to place a board atop the box, and the brace in the middle will easily support 400 lbs.

Standard Elmer's wood glue works fine, but if your in a hurry you could use five minute epoxy or epoxy gel or another adhesive.  The bond areas should be clean of dust but not sanded smooth.  The rougher the texture the better.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to use clamps to hold it together while the glue sets then predrill holes where you are going to screw it together (particularly important for the "into layer" side and use drywall screws to secure the sides)  Make a trial piece and size the drill bit to keep it from cracking but leave enough meat for the screw to grab.  Drill straight.<br>  <br>  Make sure you stand on the edges of the box or provide center support (internal X shape).

The more GPH you have, the faster it will circulate, but the important measurement, is the 'head', or how high you want to move the water above the pump.<br>  <br>  This little pump, for example, will circulate about 64 gallons per hour, and it will move the water up over 2 feet.

mwDuaWTFaa	Assuming the wire is properly sized for the 50 amp circuit, this would probably work fine and you would never know it wasn't done right.<br>  <br>  In this case, you have two devices that are both intermittent usage.  Individually, they are well within the rating of the circuit.  What are the chances that both of these items will be on at the same time?  Actually, you would need to have the water heater on and all of the elements of the stove (and oven) on at the same time to reach they maximum current requirement.  If they aren't both on at the same time for a couple of minutes, you will not experience a problem.  Even if they are on at the same time, there is a pretty good chance they would not pull enough current to trip the breaker -- just because a device is rated for 30 or 40 amps does not mean it will actually use that much.<br>  <br>  That's the thing about electrical wiring that makes it dangerous.  It will usually work fine, even if it isn't safe.  In the unlikely event that one of these devices malfunctions, the breaker may not trip as soon as it should and you will have a fire.  Not likely, but if it happens it will be a major problem.<br>  <br>  This is not a place to take shortcuts.  Have a second circuit wired.|`|LJM0zMNPaa	Those two applicances should be on two separate circuits rated for at least the anticipated amp load.<br>  <br>  Eric|`|rBUzvqcfaa	It's illegal, and here's why.  If you follow the NEC and you size the wires for that 30 amp water heater according to the NEC, if in the event for some reason there IS an overload on that water heater, and pulls a little less than 50 amps, the breaker will not trip and the wires going to the water heater will heat up and you'll have big problems.  That's why you need to have a dedicated circuit going to each of those appliances, with the wires and breakers sized according to the NEC.|`|4ROtPZQcaa	well, 40+30=70. it won't work

f52c7daf4be8ed699546253992c877a0aa	I am a painting contractor ,and your problem is a very common one ,it is charataristic of most flat /acrylic paints to do this to rome degree,sorry to say ,the cheaper the paint the worse your touch up will show, ,I has to do with how the paint light fades ,all paints fade in light ,it is just a question of how quickly they fade ,the better paints fade slower, the paint out of the can will not blend perfectly with the paint that has been exposed to light on the wall,it will look fine straight on fut it will flash when viewed from the side, you can do a couple things , you can let it be and in time it will catch up to the light faded paint,youcan blend out the edges of where you touched up and make it less noticeable,or re paint the wall corner to corner ,.Thisproblem was only an issue for the past 8 years or so, ever since the goverment made paint companies re formulate their paints they light fade worse and do not blend well when touching up,unless you get into your 35 to 40 dollar a gallon paints ....those tough up flawlessly.|`|AA10613846	The painting contractor gave you an excellent answer. And, sorry to say, there really is no "quick-fix" for this other than to repaint the entire wall. In the future, use one of those "Mr. Clean" Magic Erasors. They do work quite well, and since you have a low-lustre satin paint, marks etc. will come off quite easily.

I worked at a flower shop for 15 years...We used to dry all kinds of things.<br>  Just make sure you hang them in a place that is dry and well ventillated so that moisture isn't a problem, which can make the rose heads rot. <br>  You can also use spray glue, (available at craft stores), and it is a bit more durable and longer lasting than hairspray. <br>  After a few monthes or a year, spray them again, because they'll get dusty, and this will clean them up and make them look freshly dried...(oxymoron)!<br>  Good luck.

633f9f0030592c33a86ce834c645dcc3aa	A lot of the cost of replacing a dishwasher depends on how hard it is to get the old one out and if the new one will slide in the same hole. If you can just swap them out the cost will be a lot less than if you need to tear out and replace some cupboards. But for just swapping them it would cost you probably $100.00 to $150.00 in my area of NY. I am from around the corning area. Good Luck|`|AA12192402	I would figure about $500.00 plus the cost of the new dishwasher.
