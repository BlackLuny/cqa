From a real estate listing is a half bath in the basement counted towards the totals baths in the house?      I know for appraisals they are NOT.   A 2 full bath house with a half bath in the basement is still considered a 2 full bath house in an appraisal not a 2.5 bath.      Does the same apply to a real estate listing?      Also are you better off having 1 full master and 2 full guest baths or 1 full master SUITE and 1.5 full guest baths.   This is for a 2-story, 2,000 sq.ft home.  All baths would be above grade.

20090304105512AAsakRS	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Does anybody know much about Cash Call?	I used them 4 years ago. I was super desperate and had NO way to pay for anything (bills etc.) They gave me a loan of 5000 but before I signed the contract they wired me the money into my account. When I recieved the contract I almost passed out from the interest (which was 59%). I called them but they said the money was there and since I had a verbal agreement I had to return the contract etc. I was onlly 19 and never had a loan before so I believed them. But now I have been paying this loan and even AFTER paying a $2000 payment, I still owe like $3900 at 35% and monthly payments of $135 which I honestly can't even afford...Let alone paying more to cut the principal balance. What happens if I can't make the payments and they eventually try to sue me? I am really worried about this but since my husbands hours have been cut and I have a 3 year old, it is getting too hard. They won't help out at all, and I know they don't have to. What if I prove to the court that I can't pay anymore? I also have NOTHING to garnish...I don't own a home or car or really anything valuble. What will happen?

A friend of mine did her taxes the same time I did, the only difference is that hers was delayed. The place where we got our taxes done told her that she gets almost 6000 back. I found it odd that she was getting that much back for a person with one child, living at home with her parents and you usually don't get back much of what they take out. She says that she doesn't owe anyone anything So, did the man who did her taxes do something wrong? I guess I don't understand why the IRS audits certain people.
20090304102144AARqqWi	Business & Finance;Advertising & Marketing;Search Engine Optimization	If I want to get more hits, does my domain name matter, when I build my website?	I'm building a website for a client's flowers shop (or any type of industry). In picking a domain name ( assuming it's available), which route should I take to assure MORE hits (for SEO purposes).  Should I pick a name that reflects the name of the business, as in "sandysflowers.com" or "sandysflowers.net" OR should I pick a name that reflects key words that a potential client might use in searching for a flower shop in the area, as in "montebelloflowers.com/.net" or "flowersmontebello.com/.net"?       I would assume that the latter (using flower shop's city) would be much more effective since most people searching for a business in the Internet don't know its name and these are the people I am trying to target (new customers). Is this how it works? Please give me your opinion/experience on this.

My husband and I have just begun looking for our first home...we've been talking to a mortgage broker...we ran our credit...my husband has some negative items on his credit, some which he knew about and others that have turned out to be fraudulent.  We have disputed all the fraudulent items and have begun paying off the ones that are actually his.  The mortgage broker we've been speaking with has told us that we are pre-approved for up to $230,000 but if we go ahead and buy something, escrow wouldn't close until the negative debts have been paid off.  So the way I look at it...we're approved, but at the same time we're not.   I just was hoping that someone could shed some light on this...and explain the process in more detail for me.

20090304102011AAAnYft	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Why, despite the costs, is protectionism often a seductive and attractive policy?	For more than two centuries, economists have pointed out the benefits of free trade and the costs of trade restrictions. As Adam Smith argued more than two centuries ago, “All commerce that is carried on betwixt any two countries must necessarily be advantageous to both,” and therefore “all duties, customs, and excise [on imports] should be abolished, and free commerce and liberty of exchange should be allowed with all nations.” The economic case for free trade, however, is not based on outdated theories in musty old books. The classic insights into the nature of economic exchange between countries have been refined and updated over the years to retain their relevance to today’s circumstances. More importantly, over the past decade economists have gathered extensive empirical evidence that contributes appreciably to our understanding of the advantages of free trade.      This conclusion has been reinforced by mounting empirical evidence on the benefits of free trade, and yet protectionism is far from vanquished in the world. Would you please examine why, despite the costs, protectionism is often a seductive and attractive policy?

I'm a US citizen considering taking a very lucrative 12-month contract in the UK where I would earn over $200k.        However, it is my understanding that I'd be paying:      1.  Roughly 45% tax to the UK on 100% of the income earned (including UK national health care).     2.  28%+ tax to the US on everything earned in excess of $91k based on the 2009 foreign income exemption limits.  This makes my effective tax rate on this portion of my income around 75%!      Is this correct?  That would make this a seriously less lucrative opportunity than I'd initially thought.

20090304111328AASsH2T	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Am I Eligible for loan modification?	I was reading about the plan that Obama has passed. It says that homeowners must be in good standings. I am. We purchased our home Feb 2007, we paid $214,000. We live in the state of NV. There are about 20 foreclosures in our neighborhood. With houses selling around $140,000, same model as ours. We are not currently late on any payments, though we struggle every month to keep it that way. We also got into a 5 year ARM loan, our mortgage has not adjusted yet, we still have another 3 years. I am wondering if we are eligible for the new plan Obama passed. And if so, how do we go about this? Who do we contact? Thank you for any and all help!!

I want some opinions on this:   Here is the basic concept   One ETF(BULL) runs 200% of an index   One ETF(BEAR) runs 200% inverse of an index      Bull and bear both start at $100 per share   Day 1   Bull loses 10% of its value and is now $90   Bear gains 10% of its value and is now $110   Day 2   Bull gains 10% of its value and is now $99   Bear loses 10% of its value and is now $99   Day 3   Bull loses 10% now 89.1   Bear gains 10% now 108.9      And so on, as you can see there is clearly decay (total the the two values and they will always be less than the original $100+$100 = $200 worth).  Does it make sense to just short both ETF's and collect the difference over a period of time?

20090304111636AAqmEtJ	Business & Finance;Corporations	What are the Cons of Suspending Short Selling?	I pose this question for two reasons.  One, my lack of understanding the adverse effect of the feds suspending "all" short selling and two, because the uptick rule has been abolished.      I really believe at this stage of the economy, with all the stock manipulation that is going on by MM, that suspending Short Selling would only help the economy grow.  My reasoning behind this is quite simple; I can pick 10 stocks out of bag and more than likely 8 of them would be worth the shorting.  If everyone was doing that, the economy would be in shambles.  It like everyone winning the lottery but only being paid $1.      However, to every good idea there's always a downside and I want to know what that downside is.

20090304111035AA9slk9	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Should we get a lawyer for the problems we are having with our mortgage company, Litton Loan?	Around the 20th of February my husband got a call from the foreclosure department announcing that they had not received payment since October, and that our home was in foreclosure, according to there records we owe $7,290.00, $2,880 of which was attny fees, and $118.00 in late fees. I, being the bill payer, called them the following day, where they informed me that, according to there records at that point, they hadn't received payment since August. I got copies of bank statements and faxed the statements with a letter of dispute to the customer research department, waited 2 days, and called LL back to see who received the fax and how long we would have to Waite to hear back from them. During a two hour conversation with customer service I was informed that the research department would get back to me with in 10 days. I explained that all we wanted to do was figure out what the problem is with our mortgage and pay it. The girl from customer service informed me that, according to her records, the problems started back in February of 2008, when they weren't receiving the full mortgage and escrow pmnt. She was unsure of the details of the information she was giving me, and had to put me on hold several times to Speak with her supervisor. Our conversation was only confusing, and got us nowhere. In our loan agreement we chose to pay escrow and insurance separately, but her records show we agreed to have escrow billed along with principal and interest. 20 minutes later she apologized and said that all of this actually started in January 2008. My husband was in bankruptcy last year from January to end of March, so the customer service rep advised me to Speak with the bankruptcy department. I was transferred, I spoke with the bankruptcy rep for about 15 minutes, giving her the details of the drama, and requesting she locate the disbursement of a $4,000 check we paid via phone on March 25, 2008, at that time we were informed that our payment would have our acct in good standing and we could go back to paying principal and interest only.  {How It Started:  At that time LL paid our escrow for 2007 (without our knowledge) and began foreclosure due to payments not made in full, and again refused to accept payments until paid in full. We only learned of the near foreclosure when I called the tax assessors to find out how much we owed, they told us LL covered the taxes. We called LL to pay them for the property taxes and discovered that because they payed property taxes we ended up owing $1000.00 in attny fees and costs, piling up w/o our knowledge.}   Back to the present: The Bankrupt rep contacted me after two hours of researching our acct, and informed me that she found the $4,00 payment had not been disbursed properly, she made adjustments to our acct. I was told to send payment of $1,577.00 to be combined with $777.00 they have in forbearance and that we would be caught up through Feb, and need to send payment for PRINCIPAL and INTEREST for Mar. I overnighted the payment with a detailed letter of the issues, happy as a clam, and called a few days later to make sure that payments where applied as discussed... to discover that they have returned that payment now, too. The bankruptcy rep avoided my calls repeatedly, and when I finally got her to speak with me on the issue of the returned check she said that there was nothing further she could do, that she didn't know that we were in foreclosure (which she did, it's why I called her), and that we needed to speak with the forclosure department, to see if we qualified to work out a payment plan. We finally got ahold of the foreclosures department yesterday (as they too where not returning our calls) where they state that we owe $3,370.00 not including attny fees, dating back to October. They're payment record is also incorrect, and the rep said I will have to wate up to 30 days (remember: I was told 10 before) for the research dep to send me correspondence regarding the fax I sent them. The foreclosure dep had no idea what the cost of the fees were, and attempted to shoo me off by telling me that it could take 24 to 48 hours for them to get back to us on that. But on the other hand they were willing to see if we qualify for a repayment plan. When I stated that there was no need for that, that we have the payments to get caught up, (as they have been returning all the payments we make, the mortgage is piling up in our acct) we just need to know how much we owe in attny fees, suddenly he was able  to call the attny office himself and put me on hold while he found out how much we owe. When he got back to me I was informed that we owe a total of $2.877.00 and $156.00 in late fees, our new total (since the adjustment- which his records now show) is $6,247.19.  That's a difference of $1,043.00 from the original charges, that covered principal and interest, but the attny fees didn't change??? What???The adjustment brought us up 3 months, and the rep wasn't even posative when the

She has been insured with the same large company for over 50 years and has made two previous small claims.  april '08 we had a bad housefire, we were only able to move in 2 weeks ago.  The annual insurance was due for renewal October '08.  Checking through bank statements recently I saw that the direct debit payments were no longer taken as they usually are.  I phoned to sort this out and was told that they had declined to re-insure us.  Since this claim is still not fully completed we cannot get insurance with another company, and so currently are  uninsured.

My mother owns the bungalow but is prepared to let me have a financial interest in the property if this wuill help.

20090304124936AADdcEU	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	So in all the spendulus spending is there going to be help for mobile home owners?	Not a real serious question:  I've been trying to purchase a house I can afford for years.  The brick wall I always run up against is that I owe about about four or five times more than what the mobile home is worth ( for those who don't know mobile homes depreciate in value like a lead brick).  I've have excellent credit but I just can't seem to get out from under that stinking mobile home.  If I can get that out of my way, I can purchase a REAL house ( and do my part to help stimulate the economy).  Other than that, I'm stuck with that MoHo for seven more years.   My advice to anyone considering purchasing a mobile home - do your research.  You would fare better building a house than purchasing a substandard bubble-gum and shoestring house on wheels, and NEVER under no circumstances finance a single wide.

20090304121249AAqlHto	Business & Finance;Corporations	Layoff debate..what do you think?	So my co-workers and I are debating about how employees should be lay-off (god forbid that happens), and so I was saying that if the company was losing money and had to cut somewhere, it would be better to make a minor paycut on everyone instead of a certain person or group of people. My co-worker goes on to say that if anybody that would have the most difficult time recovering would be him since he has to pay child support. My answer to that was that everyone has their own financial obligations, and to use a child as an excuse to not get laid-off should not be valid. I gave an example as to say that I have credit card debt. Should someone feel sorry for me and not lay me off because of it? No. Same thing as someone with a family to feed, their reason for survival should not be considered more valid. I believe that work performance and senority should decide who stays and who goes.      So if you were an employer and had to choose which people to lay off, would you consider on their personal financial background or simply their work performance?

My Manager (of 2 of the jobs) just put her two weeks in. Other then her working here, there is me, and this guy.      Apparently, in the past the next in line for the management position is always the one who's been here the longest.      That would be me. So i should be getting the management position opening up.      BUT      Apparently, they asked this guy if he wanted the management position; and he hasn't been here as long as i have, he doesn't even work at the 2 out of 3 stores that I do, which means he doesn't know the customers, how to do any of the job duties, etc. etc. they would have to train him in on all of the things I do, plus more verse if they gave me the management position, all they'd have to do is teach me the management duties.      He accpeted the position, and now is in charge of me. when i asked the owner why they didn't even ask me if i was interested in the position they said that with my schooling, they didn't think it'd be possible to let me have the position. I ONLY GO TO SCHOOL, 2 days out of teh week, and we are open 6 days!.. regardless of my schooling, they should have asked me, instead of just assumed, am i right?   plenty of time to work the 32 hours required for management.... HOW IS THIS FAIR?. has any one else experienced this kinda crap?.      so now i'm lookin' for another job because i cannot stand this guy as it is. he's always talkin about how much more money he makes then i do, and bosses me around like he's my manager, when he isnt'..

Would it be nice to invest in the American Citizen so they can compete with other fast growing countries? Investments in education and health care.  See how the government invest now and see how it would work better if they invest in education and health care.       Losing a home because of medical cost can cause homelessness.    Homelessness can increase some criminal behaviors.    Homelessness can cause increased dependence on government.    Currently as a penniless criminal the government pay for representation for the defense in court;    Pay for keeping the law breaker in jail;    Pay for the homeless to get food stamps, welfare, government housing social security (if disabled) and financial aid for school.    If we have a better health care system, many will be able to keep their homes.  If we have a better educational financing system, many jobs and innovation will be made for our society which in turn could lower crimes. Just those two programs. Not controlling corporations or being socialistic, but making a better competitive America.

Before we agreed to move in on 27th.We cannot pull out as we lose 200 but landlord can do it anytime till we move in and then we have this money back. But if he does it 1 week before the end of the month, we will have only one week to find another flat and that is rather impossible. I wanna find out if we can our 200 back? Do we have any rights?

20090304121739AAjCpGm	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Has anyone ever went to a working interview or know what they are?	I had a job interview yesterday.  During the interview, the owner has numerous people applying for the job.  The owner only had a few people take a personality test including myself.  At the end of the interview, I was told that I would hear by the end of the week.      I received a call from the owner this morning asking if I could come in for a working interview on Saturday for 2 hours.  She also advised there is someone else who is coming in at another time as well.  She wanted to see who learned the presented material faster.        The owner then called me back a few hours later asking if I can come in tomorrow to learn the phone system.  Does this mean that I actually got the job the?  I have never had to go through a "working interview" so I have no idea how this is supposed to work.
20090304121908AAYHDg4	Business & Finance;Insurance	Insurance Question for 17 year old Female?	I am writing in regards to a friend and co-worker of mine, at my part-time job, who is only 17 years old (she will be 18 in a few months). Currently, she is without health insurance and has been for quite some time.       She lives with her father and step-mother who have apparently failed to provide her with health insurance. Her father just doesn't subscribe to insurance options for her. She used to live with her mother, who is on Medicaid, but because she does not live with her mother anymore she had to be taken off the Medicaid.      According to her, her father and step-mother make too much money to qualify for Medicaid, so she's basically left out. When she's sick, she never goes to the doctor because of the cost and that worries me as a concerned co-worker of someone so young with no resources or options. She recently had a miscarriage and thinks she has a kidney infection right now...or a UTI.      I'm just seeking information on what she might be able to do. I assume she has to emancipate herself in order to qualify for Medicaid, but I don't know that to be a fact.       We live in Ohio, just in case anyone has any information that I can get for her. I just feel terrible and know that she doesn't have a lot of money as a high school student who works a part time job. She literally works 5-6 days a week and her father makes her pay for everything - food, clothes, etc. Sounds like a form of child abuse to me, but right now I'm just concerned for trying to help her out...      Thank you so much for your help!

I went straight from undergrad to graduate school at the same school....which means that all of my student loans were deferred until after I completed my graduate degree.      here is the problem.  my school's student account department never updated their records indicating that i went there for grad school...which made all of my student loan payments late.      when i checked my credit score for the first time, it noted that my student loans were over 180 days past due...killing my score.      i have contacted the bureau...they confirmed that this will be taken off of my report next month.      does anyone know approximatly by how much that will raise my score....it is currently a 623.

I'm scared to quit because of the unemployment rate and i know its going to be hard to find a new job any time soon, to make matters worse i can only get a part time job now because i'm still in school until i graduate in may.      that being said, i work for a large real estate company and have been here for almost 4 years now.  when i started i was told i would get a wage review every year, and that i would get a 401K and the company would match my contributions.  since i'm only part time (35 hours, but still part time) i figured this was a good deal since i dont get vacation or sick time off.      the first year i got a 3% raise (woo hoo!  33 cents!!!).  and even better, i got a bonus at christmas (completely unexpected).  then the housing market started to tank.  the company decided that they werent doing any wage reviews so no raises that year.  and then they sent out an email saying there were no bonuses at christmas so instead they were giving us the day after christmas, and the day after newyear off.  but since i'm part time, i'm paid hourly, so now i just LOST 14 hours of work because of that.  it sucked, but my boss is wonderful and snuck an extra days pay into my paycheck to try to make up for it.      following year, same thing happened.  and on top of that, the company decided to buy a huge brand-new building (billions of dollars) and make us all move to this location.  it cost us soooo much money that they had to start laying off people.  first all the managers had to take a 10% paycut, then all the receptionist had to become partime, and then they eventually laid them off (and a whole bunch of other people too).  since our department is so small, i now get all the responsibilites of the recptionist on top of everything i already do and the CEO of the company just sent out a letter to us saying that because they had a loss they've decided to not contribute to our 401K's for 2008.      i've been working my *** off, i havent taken a day off since august 2007 because i have to do the invoices, run all our ads, add & update all the listings for 17 different builders, and now i have to make sure the agents sales to recorded so they get paid, PLUS answer the phones. i'm so stressed out, but i am worried that i wont be able to find anyother job anyways if i do leave.  my future mother in law was laid off almost a year ago and hasnt had even one job offer.  when the receptionist got laid off here 2 weeks ago she went to a temp agency and they told her that 95% of the people coming in werent getting jobs because there just werent any...      help?  suggestions?  i dont want to sound like a whiney little brat, but i'm seriously going to have a break-down at this rate.  i am hardly making ends meet and i feel like the company is just taking more and more and sucking me dry

So, I used to not pay my loans, then they almost went to garnishment, but instead I got on a rehabilitation program that said if I pay 15% of my income each month for 9 months that they would take the default status off and take off close to 10,000 in late/penalty fees and what not- and I'm 99.9% sure they said at the end of the 9 months the loan would become a regular student loan again and my payments should go down.  So, my 9 months is up next month and the lady I just spoke to today said that she arranged for the payments to stay about the same- because otherwise they would have been close to 600/month!  I know I screwed up by not paying them when I should have, but I'm trying to do the right thing now, and I can not keep paying what I'm paying now even- I've only done it this long because I HAD to, but now I have another baby on the way which means another daycare bill and all that other good stuff.  How do I get it to go down even more?  There is no way I can keep paying this rate.  I know I took out too much of a loan, but there is not a whole lot I can do about that now.  Any ideas?  Thank you!!

I am at my wits end going back and forth between the mortgage company and the county tax office.  The mortgage company shows it was sent in December, but the county says they never received it.  They asked for a copy of the check.  I called the mortgate company.  They don't send checks, they send out a mass electronic check to multiple recipients.  So now they are sending me a letter to give the county.         The county says that's not proof enough, they need a copy of a check.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!!!  Help, please!

For instance, and please don't think this is silly but is it always night shift and if so, what are the hours?

I basically was tricked into paying for my sprint closing cost. I didn't owe it with sprint but some how they were sending me bills that i didn't get and then it went on my credit report. I saw this and then disputed the item. I get impatient at times and i gave them a call. (collector that the item was with) " you will want to pay this now cause right now this item has been disputed and sprint is going to be sending to another collect and then it is going to cost you more. Let me settle this for you now and it wont end up costing you more"       So i said " Ok, can you settle this for 95.00$?"      The answer was yes.      I paid it and then got a letter in the mail the next day that the item i was disputing was a fraudulent charge and i did not owe them money.         I am now trying to get them to pay me the money back. I sent them the letter and requested they pay me back but I never receive phone calls and i am always having to fight to talk to any one.      What can i do????

I am about to move into a larger apartment in the same building and sign another year lease with the company.        Awhile after I moved in I opened a kitchen drawer and the whole front of it came off!  I got the hammer and pounded it back together.  It didn't stay for long because a big chunk of the particle board that the nails go into was missing.  Needless to say, I fixed it many times.        Finally I got fed up with it and told the manager.  She put in a work order for it.  I had put in a couple work orders prior to this for the air conditioner and the light switches not working.  Those repairs turned out fine.  It took them forever but finally they fixed the drawer.  How?  Wood glue!  I could have done that myself!      Well it works fine so I didn't really care how they fixed it.  Until today when I found a bill on my door for $53.00 for repair of kitchen drawer!  I am NOT paying 50 bucks for wood glue on a drawer I didn't even break!!!

20090304111802AABPnoh	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Can you still file your tax return and get your money if you file for bankruptcy?	I just can't afford it anymore. I have way to many medical bills, way to many other bills, my car was repo'd a year ago and then only sold for $1000 so I still owe $13000 on it. I think I owe like $10000 in personal loans, and like $5000 in credit cards. I have like $10000 in medical bills. This was all due to being laid off for 5 months and then finding a job and my husband got laid off for 8 months. We were doing fine up until those events. Now he found a job in August but his hours have been cut and he is losing days (he was out like 3 days already this pay period.) We are badly in debt now and at this point see no way out. We have tried debt counseling, debt settlement, lots. And we've paid off a lot too. We just can't handle it anymore. If we file for bankruptcy will that affect us getting a return this year?
